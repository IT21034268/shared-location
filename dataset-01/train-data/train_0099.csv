1,MORIBUND,We did not enjoy this movie. The ending was SO obvious that we both hoped we would be surprised by a twist at the end but sadly it panned out exactly as we feared. A superb example of sheer mediocrity. We did not hate the movie we just were disappointed with it. We rented it from redbox so did not waste too much money but wanted to review to save you losing your money on it by buying it on DVD. Wait until it is released on TV and when this happens if you have nothing else to do then maybe consider reading a book.
1,awful!,"I can't begin to tell you how bad this movie is! It's like a bad student film. Dialogue, characterization, sound, etc -- so bad. How could this film have won any kind of award?? The music -- gosh, don't get me started...it sounds like that royalty-free music that you can use to make home videos. The dialogue, sparse, mumbled by the actors--half the time I couldn't hear what they were saying, and what they did say did nothing to advance the plot or give insight to character. UGH!!"
3,Bick,"Track is Great but the cars???????? Had this for christmas and the kids were racing on the first day and within 1 hour 3 of the four cars the front wheels broke off while racing, called company and they said they will send 3 cars for free. How nice. Hopefully the wheels do not break off of these."
1,Really? We needed to be told this?,"I was given this book as a gift and.... REALLY?!The people that could even possibly gain insight from this overwritten and arrogant book would probably be the parents out there who would never read a parenting book to begin with. And knowing what I do about this ""accomplished journalist"" and her family makes this book laughable at best.Don't waste your time. If you are really interested at being a better parent then try any other book than this one. Better yet; try taking some advice from your mother, grandmother, aunt, etc. They're much better experts than this young woman."
2,Same info in book as Ms. Hart's weekly columns,"I was disapointed to discover that this book covers the same information (at some times nearly word for word) as Ms. Hart's weekly column. However, the book's new material is entertaining and I agree with some of book's concepts regarding setting limits and limiting choices."
4,Does what it's supposed to - good buy from Amazon,I was searching at a few stores and sites for the replacement Dymo tape and in some instances it almost paid to buy a whole new machine. I saw that Amazon sold the replacement cartriges for less than other store. I love Amazon and with free shipping you can't go wrong.
4,Nice for labeling spice containers,"Very good product, a lot of color choices, many, many uses. Excellent price online, half the price of local stores, will buy again."
5,Good quality label,I do some burning sometimes and want it to look professional. I found this to be a cheap alternative for general labeling since I don't do it a lot. I would recommend it to anyone looking to label anything including CDs.
5,Mislabled Item,"This item is incorrectly labeledDYMO White Tape/ Black Print 1/2 Inch x 23 feet, D1 Style Cartridge (45013). 45013 is black tape with white print. 45113 is white tape with black print."
5,The best Newsboys yet!!!,"Hey, all. My name is Sam and I work in a Christian bookstore. I heard the pre-release to this back in June, and loved it. It's more techno than the Newsboys usually are, but they are still in there. It's a must buy."
5,this is the best CD ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved this CD and everyone out there should buy it ""Entertaining Angels"" is the best i can just feel the music flow through my heart i can't stop listening to it not to mention Phil is hot"
5,Totally Awesome,"I strongly suggest this CD to any Christian rock fan, or just about anybody! Newsboys deliver their classic music with some new ideas, from the guitar driven beat on, ""Woohoo"" to the techno sounding, ""Truth be known, everybody gets a shot"" to the heartfelt ,""Always"". Newsboys, from Australia , once again deliver an album that doesn't have a bad song at all. The smash hit "",Entertaning Angels"" is definately their most popular song, although my favorite is either the bassy ""Hallalujah"" or ""Woohoo"". CDs like this? Newsboys previous albums ""Not Ashamed"",""Going Public"", and ""Take me to your leader"" are all great and so is the likes of Third day,The Waiting, and of course, DC talk"
4,This CD sounds very depressing,"All of the lyrics on this album are very good (with the exception of `Tuning In', which is just plain good). The music sounds very depressing, though, almost like the band was mourning the exit of John James. The best tracks on this CD are: `Entertaining Angels', `Believe', and `Always' (although it makes me want to cry every time I hear it). Out of all the albums they have, `Entertaining Angels' is still one of my favorite songs ever!"
2,Weak,"I hardly ever listne to this album. Take me To Your Leader is way better. The only songs I like on this one are Woohoo, or however you spell it, and Entertaining Angels. Way to popish for my taste."
2,Welll... It maybe had its moments.,"Welll... It had its moments. Overall I don't consider it worth the money. It was a whole lot more pop than rock, and a whole lot more pop than their earlier albums, which were all really good albums. OK, ""WooHoo,"" ""Hallelujah,"" and ""Always"" were actually pretty good, but otherwise I didn't find anything I liked. ""The Tide"" I didn't totally get. Plus, most of the guitar licks sound used and unoriginal. Their earlier stuff was a lot better, but this one (I hope) was probably a transitional album after John James left. Hopefully on their next album they'll find their footing again. Pass up this one and buy ""Take Me To Your Leader"" instead."
3,"OK, but not quite","This latest album from the Newsboys was kind of disappointing. I really enjoyed ""Take Me To Your Leader"", with its cool alt-rock sound, and was hoping that was the direction the Newsboys were going in. This wasn't BAD. I liked ""WooHoo"", and ""Entertaining Angels"" is a good song, and has a nice ear-candy sound. I like a lot of guitar in my music, though, and this CD didn't have it. I was also disappointed that John James left the band. I liked his voice better than Peter Furler's. I did like seeing Phil Joel take the mic (""Entertaining Angels""). He has a great voice. In the end, though, this album was just too much toward the pop side of pop-rock. It's an album where you need yo decide for yourself whether or not to get it."
5,New Path / Same Direction,"Message of faith, hope, and redemption! The 'Boys never compromise! I look forward to each of their releases and sharing them with others!!! Do your ears a favor and give it a try!!! Great stuff!!!"
5,It blew me away!!!,"The Newsboys are my all time favorite Christian band. I've been hooked since ""Going Public"" and have held on through some awesome albums. ""Step Up To The Microphone"" only reinforces what I've known for a long time: the Newsboys rock!!! The lyrics are in-your-face honest and tuneful enough to find yourself singing out loud at odd hours. I, too, was shocked to hear that John James had left but Peter Furler and Phil Joel do a wonderful job on vocals. Great job, guys!!!"
5,They did it again!,"The Newsboys have done it again! Even with a little different of a sound, the 'boys are still awesome. I can honestly say that every single song on the CD is a great one. Great lyrics and deeper meanings, so you can get whatever you want out of it and still hear a great sound. This CD is nothing short of everything, it's fun, relaxing, thoughtful, and happy; whatever you feel like. I could listen to this CD for hours on end, and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,THIS CD WONDERFUL!,"i went to the newsboys concert in sacremento on the 13th.... and it was THE best night of my life! i Love the newsboys! the concert kicked [you know].i love the cd too. it is my fave cd.i love the song entertaining angels! like i said,the cd is great, and anyone who doesn't like it is crazy!by!"
4,The Newsboys can still write....,"This cd did prove that the Newsboys could still function and write good songs without the leader of their group. Being their debut album as a now smaller group, I think that they did a good job on the cd. However, the Newsboys last cd, Take Me To Your Leader, was much better. The last cd, had all of the group and they were at their top notch for it. All and all, I would strongly recommend buying, Step Up To The Microphone, but it is not as good as, Take Me To Your Leader."
5,Best newsboys cd!,"This is the best Newsboys cd that I have. All of the songs on this cd are good! All of them! The best are Woohoo, Step up to the microphone, and Truth be known, which in my opinion those are the best songs. If you are a Newsboys fan than I think you will like this cd!"
5,THIS IS THE BEST CD IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!,"I listen to this CD 24-7! The songs on this album are pretty much all uplifting-make you feel good kinda music, (Exept for The Tide & Always, they are more seriouse songs...) If you are a big Newsboys fan, this CD delivers! Woo Hoo & Deep End have an awsom sound, and songs like Entertaining Angels & Believe have great lyrics. And yes, John James is gone... but personaly, I think I like Peter Furlers voice a little better! It's just too bad they only allow 5 stars... should be more like...10..."
5,5 stars are 5 too short,"Warning, the Newsboys are addictive. Super positive, uplifting lyrics, and music as good or better than any secular recording. A must have for any fan of high quality, catchy, makes you want to sing along, music."
5,I LOVE the newsboys!,I would have to agree with the girl from Napa. I went to that concert and it was the greatest! I discovered the newsboys from my cousin in Oregon about three years ago. Ever since then I have been a huge fan. This album is great!
5,DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THID CD KICKS(well you know)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not what I expected?,"My favorite cut is BELIEVE.The first four cuts were pretty good ,but the rest of the album got lost in the translation.Corney keyboard intros, and the vocals are not the same,but try to emulate the former singer Mr.James.What really bothers me about this album is the message is a little dilluted,not like their former albums.They lost the plot on Jesus a little.Anyway overall I much prefer them to any of there contemporaries in secular music.They need a harder edge to their sound!Bye.Drop the horns please."
4,The first week was the best!,"The first week I had this ablum I listened to it about 20 times! I thought to myself, this is the best album ever! But than around 28-29 times around, my enthusiasm slowed. Angels started to get under my skin :) and Woohoo began to irritate me. I almost gave it three stars but than I said ""if you listened to it 30 times in less than two weeks it's gotta be at least a 4."" Buy it, don't overlisten to it though!"
3,It's Cool,"From the outside, this telescope looks really cool. But when you try to piece it together, it's complicated. The price of this telescope is reasonable in the toy section. It's still really good."
5,Love Through Letters,"This is a lovely book that describes the correspondence between Sarah Austin and Prince Hermann von Puckler-Muska, which still remains despite several attempts by well meaning family members on both sides to eradicate it. Now available to the public thanks to a Polish archive, Hamburger has been able to write this wonderful book on Sarah and her marriage to John Austin and her mental love affair with a handsome prince. Entrusted to translate his work, she quickly becomes infatuated with him and writes long, personal letters, which he chooses to keep locked in his desk. She fears being exposed by her writing, but continues to pursue closeness with her prince despite how much in could ruin her marriage. She's leading a double life though, and cannot conceive of hurting her husband or daughter, which, strangely, Puckler decides to honor. And that has been her legacy, a good Victorian housewife, despite such passionate letters. A great read to see behind the official period history."
4,This is THE MOVIE for Tenchi fans,"For all of you who love Tenchi Muyo you have to buy this movie. Actually you shuld buy all 3, but of the 3 I like this one the best. This movie can be enjoyed by the family and is just plain good."
3,Vaio by Sony,"It was okay, but did not have the original software or the video card, it has served the purpose it was purchased for."
2,Sony should stick to TV's,"I have been very disappointed with my new Sony Vaio. They advertise it as a media machine, however, it doesn't come with much of the software I needed. i.e. There is no Audio Capture software. The CD/DVD burning software is limited as to the number of formats it will burn.However, most of my frustration has come from trying to get phone support from Sony. After a few hundred questions from the automated phone attendant and 30-40 minutes on hold, their support people seem to be less than knowledgeable and very disinterested in helping.Bottom line: Buy a Dell!"
1,Bogus Picture,"I bought this product PCG-GRX770 based on the picture on your web site, the picture has a JOG DIAL on the product, the product you sent me does not, I think this is very unfair because the only reason I bought it was because I wanted the jog dial, now I have the problem to send it back."
2,Walk Away the Pounds LIVE - 2 miles,I have several of these Videos and like them. This one is very hard to follow because it is done in a MAll setting - hard to hear Leslie's instructions and get the beat and so much video confustion/distraction looking all around the MALL. Great she had that much of an audience but like the videos from the studio much better.
2,Quality,the dvd looks like a bootlegged piece of crap. the video quality is horribleI dont recommend this version for anyone not even worth the 6.17 I paid for it.
3,Interesting,"It was my first Aamir Khan movie, wasn't sure i liked him in the beginning but ti got better and better with the interesting plot - Kajol is great as always but as they say, she lights up best with SRK."
4,Already submitted,submitted yesterday I believe please accept my review already submitted.The book was good but this is tedious please delete this after reading
5,Route 66 personified...,"While in a different vein than her previous book about Route 66 (Route 66: The Highway and Its People) Quinta Scott has successfully captured the feeling and vision of what Route 66 has become to many -- the soul of America. Her black and white photographs, some taken in the early 1980s, some taken in the late 1990s, depict an essence of nostalgia toward ""The Mother Road"" that is just now being widely realized amongst a cross-section of America. State Route 66 Associations have been working together to preserve and protect this long ribbon of a historic monument, and Quinta Scott's book can aid in those efforts. This is your history, America. Read it, look at it, and remember it!"
2,Very poor picture and sound spoil a good film,"A very poor transfer of a very good film.Laserlight have done nothing to restore the print.The picture is dark and washed out.The sound is also very poor.The story has some great scenes,such as the finale in the hall where the assassination attempt takes place,but you have to watch a muddy picture with crackling sound.Wait for another version to come out."
3,Watch It Without Compareing It!,"I understand why people would compare this and the brilliant remake- I DO TOO!!! But one should watch it every once in a while without compareing it. I saw this version first so I couldn't compare it and I found it to be a real gem. No, not as good as others butnotable Hitchcock. This tale of the kidnapping of a young girl (played by ""Young And Innocent""'s Nova Pilbeam)in an attempet to keep vital information about an assasination from being told by the pearents who came upon the information by mistake.It is very enjoyable and has some creative camera and montage work in it. Such as when the mother reads the letter telling her that they have her daughter the camera spins really fast and she faints. There are of course others as well.This really is a great movie and if you haven't seen it you should check it out."
2,The remake was better...,"But this version still has its moments. You can easily see why Hitch loved this story enough to remake it, and once having seen both versions, will applaud his decision to do so.The problem with this DVD is not the content, but rather the technical quality of the transfer. I have seen 8mm home movies with better production values. The sound is particularly annoying, and the video not much better.While I can understand the many imperatives for making this version available, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone other than a rabid Hitchcock fan, and then only for historical perspective. It is truly a shame to see such a wonderful film rendered so horribly and a stellar Director's vision, treated so shabbily."
5,The original - and best.,"Don't even think about buying the James Stewart / Doris day version until you've seen this film. With all the padding (not to mention Doris Day's singing) missing from the original version, the pace is faster and story more exciting. Peter Lorre is on top form and even the Albert Hall scene is more exciting than in the remake. This is definitely one of Hitchcock's best pre-war films - easily on a par with 'The 39 Steps' and 'The Lady Vanishes'."
3,Immature Hitchcockism,"This film is well-made, and rather interesting, but for one who has seen both versions of that film (the second from 1956 starring James Stewart and Dorris Day), this film contains all the symptoms of lack of experience as a director that Hitchcock tried to avoid when he chose do remake it. The famous climax scene (during a concert in the Royal Albert Hall) is too short to fulfill the tension and horror that the main actress, Edna Best, experiences. Also the attempts to save the child that has been kidnapped, by firing at Peter Lorre, the bad guy, and eventually the success in invincing him, are mediocrately put. It seems that Hitchcock has left the ending as it is just to show the spectators that everything is back to normal. He could have cut the last 20 minutes, and thus leave us with a ""gout d'encore""."
4,swim bikini brief,"I tryed ordering the swim suit listed on their web sight in the photo ad. Unfortunately I tried many times with specific instructions to make sure the color was that used in the ad photo, but never got that color. I do have many of the other colors of that swim brief and like them very much. I really wanted that color used in the ad photo, so I'm very disappointed in that respect. The reason from the company Bonnie & Clyde was that the color dyes were too hard to match the one in the photo. Order was not the last order, but a previous order for the color Hawaiian Blue."
2,POOR QUALITY!!,"I purchased this for my 4 year old thinking it would be a great nightlight. Not a good idea for young children because the glass ball is not attached and is very heavy. Consequently,it will break things if thrown ( the glass ball will not break or crack very well made) anyways... the light projected is VERY dim. It did not project on the ceiling or the walls. Also the sound quality is barely audible. Only two of the six sound was average quality. I bought mine for $19.99 and it was thrown away within two weeks. Spend your money on something else....it just doesnt do the job."
5,A Math Lover's Classic,This book was inspiring and worth being read again and again. I have given many away as gifts.
5,A Great book.,"Carry on, Mr. Bowditch is a great book! In the book Nat Buys an expectation from Tom Perry at a age of about 7 or 8 (It's like investing is today) than He grows up and teaches himself school. He discovers many things and is good at math. Except for a few sad parts of this book this book is an exalent book."
4,Great book,"I remember my mom made me read this story when I was homeschooled. Carry on Mr Bowditch was a book that I actully enjoyed reading when I was homeschooled. Mr Bowditch is an inspiration. He had the attitude that he could do anything he could put his mind too.I recently saw this book on sale at the library and immediatly snatched it up. I read it for the second time. Which is something I rarely do.And I told my mom that I wish I had the determination that this kid had.I gave this book 4 stars because this book became depressing at times. His mother died, his grandmother, his father(I am assuming died because he was never mentioned after awhile), his sister, his brother in law his two brothers and his first wife.So you see all this death is in the book. But this is a nice book and I enjoyed it."
5,Classic for a reason!,We are all loving this title. An inspiring book about a man who's life is an inspiration!A super family story!
4,held my attention,I read this book as a book club selection- it takes place in early New England and taught me some about the way lives were lived at that time. This young man had a talent with numbers and facts and a desire that no one should suffer from bad information.
4,Bowditch in Manila!,"I would hazard to say that there is no Geodetic Engineer or Surveyor or even a Civil Engineer in the world, before the advent of satellites, that did not have recourse to the log tables Mr. Bowditch had meticulously prepared by hand on his voyages to Asia in the late 18th century. The science of navigation by star and lunar sightings had finally arrived.When the Manila galleon was busy plying the route to Mexico laden with spices and silk, the ship from Salem called the Astrea, and a few others, sailed to the other side of the world carrying with it the first cargoes of abaca that ever reached the east coast of the United States. Without Bowditch aboard and his genius for mathematics the navigation relying solely on dead reckoning would have been next to impossible, if not downright hazardous for any merchant to make a profit. A wonderful story about sailing ships and the courageous men that manned them during the time of sail."
4,A fascinating and inspiring read!,"This is a story of a life that impacted the world. Through poverty Nathaniel Bowditch was unable to go to Harvard and had to grind through a nine-year apprenticeship but throughout that time he kept up his study of mathematics. Because of his mastery of mathematics he was able to navigate without reliance on sun or stars making the seas a safer place for all the sailors in the world through the publication of ""The American Practical Navigator"". This story of a little known giant of history is full of interest at many levels. Boys and Girls from ten years upwards would find a this a fascinating and inspiring read."
4,An inspiring story,"Nat has every reason to expect that he will be able to attend college and go on to a happy professional life. Then everything is taken away from him. His father has a tragedy at sea and is forced to leave his life as a captain and become a menial worker. His mother dies and his father takes his sorrows out in drink. Nat must then leave school and become an indentured servant. His dreams of school seem lost to him forever.Nat never succumbs to feeling sorry for himself or bitterness. Instead, he finds a way to use his workplace to better himself, learning everything he can about ships and navigation. He is able to take this new knowledge and teach others, becoming well known as a brilliant mathematician and navigator.The life of Nathaniel Bowditch is a wonderful story of finding good in bad and becoming all one can become."
3,Short but sweet,"I found this book helpful at summarizing big, complex ideas. However, there were several instances in which I felt this book did not fully explain what I wanted to know. At those times, I had to go to the large, hardback book this short summary comes from (Casarett & Doull's Toxicology: The Science of Poisons). However, this book was much cheaper and, most of the time, very helpful."
2,eh....,Too general to be of much use. The full book (Toxicology) expands on everything you WISH this one did.
1,WORST,"Amazon is the worst retailer in the world after 32 days I contacted Amazon (they do not let you do it before to ""allow for delivery)to find out where was my item and they just gave back the money. I need this book for class. I hate you Amazon. If this gets published, costumers beware!"
5,her ryhmes are fast! and she's worth tha weight,"when i got this album i really liked shake dats sh*t the bestbut then it grew to more songs, the best songs here aare rpm were she raps faster than twista, lets go, what can i do ft. missy elliot, u crazy ft. jermaine dupri, turn it up and my chicago.So if you want cool, fast rap buy thisif you want hardcore slow rap get lil kimOverall- 83/100"
2,"Worth Tha Weight....Sadly, no","What did Shawnna do to get a poorly put together, rushed album out into the stores? Shawnna is pretty nice on the mic, even though the pool of female rappers isn't that deep right now, but she didn't deserve this. Her first single off `Worth Tha Weight' was on point in ""Shake Dat Sh**"" w/ Ludacris, but the rest is pretty much scattered low filler material. ""R.P.M"" w/ Twista & Ludacris was already on the `Golden Grain' album, but it's a great song for the people who didn't here it. My favorites on this album are ""My Chicago pt 1"" & ""My Chicago pt 2"", produced by B-Crucial, but here's the thing-they're both less than a minute long and are both the same beat, which won't cut it. DTP/Def Jam should have taken A LOT more time in gettin' this album made, cause I'm sure everyone who bought this got BURNED bad."
3,Typical,"This CD fits right into the current mindstate of Hip Hop music today. The majority of the high points of this CD has already made radio, however the rest of this CD is solid. If you support DTP cop this one, if not. Well.. just ""weight""."
3,Really worth the wait???,"After a long time hearing her on the hooks of Ludacris songs and on the Disturbing The Peace CD, I was excited for her debut album to be released. From what I have heard from her in the past, I think this could of been a lot better. Some songs are just ridiculously played out. The major problem is that there is not really any tracks except two or three that stick out. Maybe this will grow on me more because CD's have a tendancy to do that and hopefully it will.Standouts:Let's GoR.P.M with Ludacris & Twista---AMAZING RYHMES/ FAST RAPS!Shake Dat Sh** with LudacrisU Crazy with Jermaine Dupri---Best song on the entire album. Very good!"
4,her ryhmes are fast! and she's worth tha weight,"when i got this album i really liked shake dats sh*t the bestbut then it grew to more songs, the best songs here aare rpm were she raps faster than twista, lets go, what can i do ft. missy elliot, u crazy ft. jermaine dupri, turn it up and my chicago.my least favourite song is super freak, Best song- R.P.M Ft. Twista and ludaSo if you want cool, fast rap buy thisif you want hardcore slow rap get lil kimOverall- 83/100"
2,Not what I expected,"I've been a huge Shawnna fan since I heard her on all of DTP's songs. She's kills it on songs like R.P.M. and N.S.E.W. (and some others) where she just goes nuts. She didnt have very good beats to work with and I expected more fast songs besides Block Reincarnated and R.P.M., and Posted which had all alredy been released.I feel guilty doing this but dont buy this CD. Just ""acquire"" these songs:-Weight A Minute- The Violin makes for a HOTTTTTT Beat. All my friends who didnt even know who Shawnna was like this song.)-Let's Go- Pretty fast song-R.P.M.- Not a new song but its one of my favorites ever.Other hot songs with Shawnna:-Posted (Golden Grain)-Break Somethin (Golden Grain)-N.S.E.W (Golden Grain)-Pimp Council (Golden Grain)-Slum (2 Fast 2 Furious Soundtrack)-Get The **** Back (Word of Mouf)"
2,Hmm....,"Based on my star rating...all I have to say is their really is ""Something About Remy"" cuz she's who i'm waiting for now.A month ago I was like man Shawnna is the hardest female out, she'll eat Remy alive, blahzay, blahzay. MAAAAAAN when I heard this peice of crap album I was like what the H.E.L.L. was this girl thinking making this bullcrap album! Her album was not Worth The Weight, so people, save your ""weight"" and spend it on somebody elses album. And if you already spent your ""weight"" on it like I did, u can go to a moms and pops store and sell it back like I did. u won't get all your ""weight"" back but at least you'll get SOMETHING out of the album."
1,wasnt worth my wait,"this is almost the worst cd ever.this cd was a waist of plastic,they shold take all of these cds and recycle them.if could i would give this cd a neg 3.DTP needs a new 1st lady.this cd wasnt worth the wait at all, some1 lied to shawnna,it was only 3 good songs, shake that s***,u crazy and the song wit twista. this cd should of went on sale last week"
4,Worth The Weight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!2 COME,Dude (remix)Shake Dat Sh**Let's GoAnd so real so right R THA best tracks on itBUY IT AND U WILL NOT REGRET IT I SOLD THA CLEAN VERSION 2 GET THA EXPLICIT BUT WHO THE HELL CARES BUY IT OR BUY LUDACRIS OR JUST GET THA WHOLE DISTURBING THA PEACE FAMILY$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Ya Heard Me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Oh and i rated this 4 stars cuZ there's alot of stupid retarded songs on here that suck
2,I can't believe this,"I was highly disappointed from this lack of effort CD. I've been waiting for Shawnaa to drop, since I heard her on Disturbing the Peace CD. Ludacris should have made sure that she had tighter beats to flow to. On everybody's tracks, Shawnaa is always ripping it, but this was a total let down."
4,Shawnna's POSTED!!,"The cd is bangin! The production really kicks ass and Shawnna has some sort of different vibe that other bitches in the game don't have. ""Posted"" Remix is definetely my favorite song on the album even though it samples one of Noreaga's songs. I also like the fact that Shawnna states in one her songs that Def Jam hasn't had a real bitch in the game since Foxy was lil. Forget what anyone else says, Shawnna's got skills."
4,Shawnna Is The Real Deal Of Women in Hip-Hop,"Signed with Def Jam and DTP (Distrubing The Peace), it was her time to come out. With her heat packing single ""Shake That Sh*t"", I knew er other tracks would be just as raw and real. The only female in Disturbing The Peace, Shawnna came out in the prowl to hunt her prey...that is her audience. Some old and new fans, her 18-track (including the remix of ""Dude"" from Beanie Man and Ms. Thing shows that she is just as an equal Chicago reg as Kanye West, Twista and R.Kelly. It was worth the ""wait"".GO GET HER ALBUM!!!"
3,3.5 Stars,"Shawnna is the best female in the game hands down, but this album was a bit of a dissapointment there is no personal music and it is nothing but club music, but still A MUST HAVE!!!"
4,Excellent for more advanced solitaries,"What a shame that we have lost Scott Cunningham in this life, because he was one of the few authors who invite self-exploration and experimentation rather than forced subscription to specific beliefs and adherence to pubished ritual practices. This book is truly encouraging to those who might be nervous about saying the ""wrong"" words... he reminds us that the power is within ourselves and the earth, and we need only coax it out."
3,"Not bad, but not the best","I have enjoyed this book but not learned as much as some of the other Wiccan books I have read. It just doesn't seem like there is a lot of good content in it. I enjoyed his book, ""The Magical Household"" a lot more. But still, a good book for beginners."
5,"Living Wicca, A Further Guide, Is the best book I've read!","Living Wicca, A Further Guide For The Solitary Practioner, by Scott Cunningham is the best book I've read on the Craft. I was just beggining to step out onto my path and I read this book... Man it had a great impact on my life! I wish that he could be here so I could thank him, but I'm sure he knows. I thank him for writing this book and I thank the Goddess and God for inspiring him to do many writing in his short lifetime in this incarnation.Blessed Be"
2,I concur with other reviewers....,"...in what a disappointment this sequal to ""Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practioner"" was. The first 'Wicca' is excellent - the invocations are beautiful, the information well-researched and sound. I also like the bibliography in the back, as it recommends a lot of books that I haven't come across before, and they all sound very interesting. All in all, a classic.But the sequel? Skip it. Aside from some practical info like advice to reading and compiling information from various sources (as much of what solitiaries learn are typically from books), and two well-done chapters about Goddess and God, it just in no way compares to the beauty and heart of the first book.His other books on natural magic however, are wonderful! His encyclopedias on crystals, herbs, techniques of natural magic, creating magical crafts, are definitely worth a read! But this one book? Skip it. You'll learn much more from his other offerings."
4,A great book for all the solitary practioners out there.,"Any book by Cunningham is an informitive resourse, but this book and his first book in this series are by far the best he has done. I enjoyed both books, but this is the one I use most often. As with any book published by Llewellyn, I would recommend this book in particular. The book itself is well thought out and consise, helping the begining solitary through ever step they need to know in their first few efforts as a practioner. It also will be a book that the practioner will go back to time and again."
4,A Wonderful Beginners Book,I think that Living Wicca is a wonderful book for beginners. It supplies you with the basics of Wicca. It gives you alot of good advice on how to go about getting started. I would highly suggest this book for a beginner.
3,"Ok, if you understand what you are doing.","I'd have to say this book's predocessor is far better than this one. However, if you are looking to make your own ""tradition"" in the Wiccan belief system, Scott Cunningham offers the basic fundamentals you will need to have such a religion."
3,How many times do we have to hear it?,"This book may not be bad if you're a beginner, and you've read no other books on witch craft. Basically Mr. Cunningham has repeated the basics from any book, as well as his own previous work. I don't recommend buying this as well as the Guide to the Solitary Practitioner. I believe a book on Wiccan should give something fresh to work with instead of the same material in different words."
2,"Not as good as the ""Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary...""","After reading ""Wicca: A Guide For the Solitary Practitioner""; I bought the sequel, and to say that I was disappointed would be an understatement.This book covers some of the same grouund ""Wicca"" does, but not enough technique and theory to use this book alone. This book has some useful material you may like, but in my opinion the added material is NOT worth the price.Questions or comments? E-Mail me. Two Bears.I am not Wiccan; I am a Shaman.""Therefore, Wicca can be described as a shamanic religion. As with Shamanism, only a select few feel compelled to enter it's circle or light"" Page 4 ""Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner"" Scott Cunningham.Wah doh Ogedoda"
5,A review I did on my site:,"I do reviews on my website, and felt I should share it with anyone interested in buying this book: The education of Living Wicca is based solely on a study guide plan for the serious Solitary Wiccan. There are a few chants and prayers included, but the content mostly revolves around where to go to learn more and how to create your own tradition. The suggested reading at the end of each chapter and at the end of the book is invaluable! Mr. Cunningham provides descriptions and useful passages of every book suggested, and considering his background I personally trust his judgment. Another great piece of work Scott, and may the Goddess enfold you in Her arms."
2,Overly Simplistic,"A good book to get through the basics, or for incredibly light reading. Most of this proved to be skimming material, as it touched on things I already know and think upon myself. If you're looking for something with depth and meat, I wouldn't suggest this book."
3,Starts strong ends strong but still seems to lack,"Cunningham did quite well in putting together this book, he starts strong, continuing where he left off while at the same time simultaneously picking up any new comers along the way. He quite eloquently writes the information that can come in handy for a pretty decent BoS but somehow along the way to the end he misses and loses a few people. The book is strong but probably Borrowing it from your local library first would be a good idea before picking this one up."
4,Interested In Wicca? Buy This Book But Don't Expect Miracles,"After reading this book.. I sat back and thought about the first book.. and came to one conclusion.. This book talks in circles and rambles on and on about common sense logic.. I do however think this book makes an excellent read and I would recommend it, but I don't think it was as informative as the first. However it does give interesting approaches to subjects you may not have read about or are not familiar with.. Buy the book.. but I would recommend Wicca 2000 for someone new to Wicca."
2,No better than the first,"Much like Cunningham's first guide for the solitary Wiccan, this book was disappointing. There is very little of practical use, just a lot of hypothetical philosophy and a few contrived chants. Maybe that does it for some people, but for those who, there again, don't live in the middle of a secluded woods with unlimited access to natural items, the book offers nothing."
1,Cats Reincarnate Too?,"This books tells you what to believe... period. There's actually a bullet point that says ""Cats Reincarnate Too"" under Wiccan beliefs. Really? Outrageous! This book is for the mindless, blind follower. If you have half a brain and can think freely, at all... don't buy this book!! Wicca is about ""An it harm none, do as ye will,"" which is all about designing your own beliefs, not having someone tell you what they are."
3,Living Wicca,"This book was okay, if you wanted to learn something. It wasn't quite what I expected, but it helped in alot of ways. If you want to learn more about wicca, I suggest you read this book."
3,"Good, but not as good as his first book..",I was actually sad about this book. His first one wasn't as informative as this one. It's good..but not great. I wouldn't recommend this one.
3,Not what the first book was,"When I rented this book from the library I had high hopes of another great read like a solitary practitioner was. Granted this book was very informative and had a great trove of insite. I was just disappointed in it. I guesse I shouldn't have my expectations that high, but I would suggest renting it before you buy it so you can get an idea of the contents. A good thing to do with just about every book before you buy it, but a must for this one."
3,Step Two,"Of course most people on this path don't make it this far, and Cunningham notes that in this book. Excellent as the next step, as it is easy to read and much of the information is practical for those moving onto more advancement of their path. Read the first book, Wicca, first, or much of this one won't make sense."
4,Very Helpful,"I have required this book for all my fellow coven members. Even though we usually work in groups, I find it useful nonetheless, especially for managing and planning your Spellbook (Book of Shadows)."
5,Great Read,Very good book to have on hand. I reference it daily. Wonderful for someone just beginning their journey on this path.
3,Other Books,"Living Wicca is Scott Cunnigham's followup to this Wicca : A Guide For the Solitary Practitioner. If you just want to read a bit about the religion and how people practice it, you really don't need this book, just get the first one and it will satisfy your interest. This is more for those who are definitely interested and want to read more for themselves."
5,an excellent follow up to the first book,"a must for all solitary wiccans. well written and easy to understand, an informative and more complete guide for wiccans."
5,Great book for the beginner,If you are new to Wicca and have already read guide for the Solitary Practitioner this is the perfect follow-up. As in Cunningham's first book this also is easy for the layman to follow and lends comforting tones to the beginner.
5,Pagan,This is a informative good read. Detailed and well layed out. Presents material with a good objective view point. Well written guide.
2,Cunningham Should Have Quit While He Was Ahead,"Personally, I found this book empty, unfeeling, and totally devoid of useful information. This is a great shame, because its predecessor is a good introduction to Wicca. Living Wicca seems like less of a guide to developing a Wicca of one's own, and more like Wicca the Cunningham Way. The author loops and swirls and writes all over the place save directly and coherently. It's my conviction that a fledgling Wiccan would be far better off working their imaginations than being spoonfed by this book. Oh, and if you look closely, you might notice all of the white space in the pages. It's true, this book has nothing much to say."
2,Dissapointing,"There was nothing in this book for me. I wish I hadn't bought it. If you're looking for something for a more advanced practitioner, this isn't it. If you're looking for something that will help you establish your own tradition, step by step, you might like it though."
5,This book put everything into focus,"I have been studying for 2 years and have covered so many topics, so many different ways and have been so totally unsure of myself. I wish that I had read this book after my first introduction into witchcraft. For me, it put all of it into place. Simply written, not anything like what I have been studying, it simply ordered things for me. Thank you for this guidance. I can now relax and grow without worrying about having done something wrong.I love this book!"
3,"Good Intro , Needs More","I gave this book 3 star.Pro: Good Introduction to the practice and motifs behind the Wicca, how to set an altar, understanding deities etc.Cons: not a very helpful reading, since it does not explain in details, how to make things work, and how to establish a good connection with the forces and energies needed in Wicca ceremonies.If you know the Basics you should skip this book, if you are new to Wicca is a good staring point but should be supplemented with other readings."
1,this is a bad idea,"Get one that goes around your neck, we lost $300 with this wallet as it is not easy to deal with opening and closing it around your waist."
2,"Belt seems good, got it too late to use","I ordered this money belt two weeks before my trip to Europe; nevertheless, I had to travel without it, since it got delivered two days after I left. Even after repeated attempts to contact the vendor, I even offered to pay for faster shipping, but I never got a response. The belt itself seems of good quality, but I have not had the chance to use it yet"
1,Not the best money belt for women,"I purchased this money belt before going on a 3 week vacation in Europe. I selected this money belt because it had good reviews, but as a petite female I found that this money belt was too big & bulky. It did not stay snug fitting on me. I have a flat stomach and this belt made me look like a had a pouch. I will definitely give it away and purchase another."
1,Returned item due to missing piece on cap,"The fountian pen is wonderful, the brand speaks for itself. The seller of the item failed to mention that the white piece on the top of the cap was missing. Also the pen and the cap don't have the exact same finish. I am assuming this was a combinaiton of different waterman pens and I am returning it."
5,Waterman fountain pen,"Got my pen quite quickly. Writes very smoothly. Comes with one ink cartridge, but does not come with an ink convertor. Very happy with my purchase."
4,Waterman expert fountain pen,"The waterman fountain pen was purchased as a gift. It arrived in a beautiful box,in mint conndition and from what I understand is writing very well. My friend loved it so much he ordered another waterman fountain pen."
1,Much Information is very out of date / no longer accurate,"Much of the information is out-dated. Many of the financial products referred to have changed alot over the years. This is true particulary about Variable Universal Life Insurance, as well as Variable Annuities. These products have greatly improved over the last 5 years, and much of the information in this book does not apply to the newer products.The author is not licensed for insurance, not securities licensed, not an investment advisor, and is not a CFP. Therefore she does not have any clients. People who just write books can write almost whatever they want, and are not held to the same standards as licensed professionals. You should be careful of the advice you get from people who only make a living by writing books and articles, and are not licensed professionals."
4,Information I could understand,"Lynn O'Shaughnessy's book Retirement Bible was informative and helpful as I plan for my retirement. It was in a format that even I could understand. I appreciated her help on buyer beware. I will probably hire a good financial advisor to assist and this book has educated me, so when I do interview advisors I hope they will be ready for all my questions."
3,"Nice unit, but finding a bulb that fits the included trim is impossible.","I got this unit, hooked it up, bought an r20 bulb from HD, and it wasn't long enough. The unit itself is fine, its just the trim included is not the right trim. I had to goto HomeyDepot and pick up a trim that was wider and deeper that was able to fit a r20 bulb. The problem with this unit is that the bulb cannot be moved forward or back (its a fixed unit). If you notice the 4"" units at HD, they can be adjusted inside to allow you to move the bulb forward. This unit, the bulb is stationary in its farthest position. That would be fine if they included a trim that was long and deep, which they don't."
1,Misleading and offensive,If you are a woman you may find some of the language in this book degrading and very offensive. I recommend you stay away from this book.The synopsis and title of the book are misleading because the book talks little about the show (except for an interesting tidbit here and there) and focuses more on the friendship between the author and his very immature friend.
1,Tresspass in Hazzard County??? Not Exactly.,"This book tends to focus on one actor alone and gives very little inside information about the show or any other actors. I really felt mislead after reading the advertisement for the book. It should be retitled something else. It primarily deals with the author's friendship with John Schnieder and how it came to a very bitter end. Over all it was not what I anticipated or expected and I was very disappointed.However, it is well written and does make for some intereting reading, just not about the Dukes of Hazzard the show."
3,The most interesting Hollywood memoir in years!,"""Trespass In Hazzard County: My Life As An Insider on the Dukes of Hazzard"" is the most interesting Hollywood memoir in years! Author Richard Jensen details his years working in show business in general and on the hit TV show in particular. Conversational in tone, the book reads as if Jensen is sitting in your living room telling you the story of his experiences with the sex, drugs and intrigue in Tinseltown. ""Trespass"" doesn't pretend to be an analysis of the Hollywood culture. Instead, Jensen tells his personal story, and his stories are alternately hysterical, shocking and sad. Dukes of Hazzard fans will find this book an eye-opener!"
4,A good story of innocence lost.,"I bought this book thinking it was an expose' on Hollywood and it was that and more. Jensen writes very well, telling his story in a voice that made me think he was sitting in my living room talking to me. Dukes fans, like me, will be shocked at some of the tacky behavior of John Schneider (Bo Duke), especially the way he treated Jensen, who was his friend. The rest of the Dukes cast fare well in this memoir, especially Sonny Shroyer (Deputy Enos), who Jensen says is actually a terrific actor. There is a lot of humor and alot of introspection. The saddest part is the end where Jensen writes, ""I left Hollywood and no one noticed..."""
5,Covers all major IT concepts,"This book gives a concise and impressive insight into all major concepts relating to Information Tehchnology. It is ideal for those who like to grasp the Information Technology concepts in the shortest possible time, which will enable them to be equipped with knowledge that would have taken much much longer time, if not for the distilled facts and coverage done by this book."
1,Missing CD,"Great book content. I did not receive the CD for this book. Contact emails were kicked back to me as ""no response emails"". Be sure to enquire about the cd."
1,Great Book...But amazon...,"The book is great for someone who doesn't know much about digitalization.I ordered this book and just received it. I am very disappointed in Amazon because I received the book in a poor condition, the CD is missing and last but not least it is not a hardcover book. I am definitely sending this back to Amazon so people be aware before buying this book."
5,One of my all time favorites,"I LOVE this movie! As a social worker who works with individuals with intellectual disabilities, I can tell you the depiction is first rate. Every actor gives his all and hits the mark without being stereotypical. It shows the trials of everyday life but also the warmth and humor making the characters very real - I almost feel like I know each of them. I have this movie in the VHS format and have played it (and loaned it out) so many times it is worn out so I am replacing it with this DVD version. You will not be disappointed - this movie has heart!"
5,Perfect Characterizations,"Having worked in education with clients just like ""the boys"", I must say that these actors do a WONDERFUL job portraying their characters. At times we laughed so hard we cried; and other times, we just cried. I hope the film fosters a better understanding of mentally & emotionally challenged adults. They are human beings with feeling and emotions just like those of us who are not challenged in that area. This film does a wonderful job of expressing those feelings. This is one movie you won't regret watching."
1,Don't waste your money.,"What a waste. I waited weeks for my copy to arrive. I do not want to be TOO negative, but I would not watch this video again if somebody gave it to me for free."
1,I Can't Believe I Actually Paid Money For This Film,"I feel I'm being generous in giving one star. This is one of the poorest videos in my collection. If you're a beginner, please don't start here. It will teach you bad habits that you will just have to ""unlearn"" when you finally do start painting."
1,not so good.,"Much is made of dyson's intellectual prowess; this just goes to show you that all things are relative. There are organisms shuffling down the street to whom dyson's intellect would, one assumes, seem impressive. But that don't necessarily make it so. You may, at some point, have heard the term pinhead. The term signifies that the owner of such a head has a tiny little brain, a ""peabrain"" if you will. This, in a nutshell, is dyson. He meanders around offering weak commentary and observation that appeals chiefly to the MTV and BET crowd. This is to say, he offers nothing of value other than allowing Penn to make their quota. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs."
5,"The ""Book of Books"" about the science of rocketry","For more than 30 years this superb book has been the basic text for tens of thousands of rocket scientists, astronauts, engineers, and amateur scientists alike. It is universally recognized as the ""Bible"" of rocket propulsion theory and practice, and remains the fundamental and basic text for everyone seriously engaged in this complex field of research and development.Sutton's book should be the very first purchased for anyone who wants to learn and understand the ins and outs of both solid and liquid-fuel rocket propulsion. No other book even comes close."
4,good! and a vast improvement over the 5th Ed,"Sutton rolls out a much improved version of his venerable classic, Rocket Propulsion Elements. When I was going to school, we had the 5th edition, which left quite a bit to be desired. While collaberating with a recently graduated engineer, he kept coming up with good information that he assured me was, ""In Sutton."" Knowing the 5th edition frontwards and backwards, I assured him it was not. We compared copies, my 5th Ed to his 6th, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the work of the 5th ed was vastly expanded in the new 6th Ed. I just wish the 6th Ed had come out a couple years earlier.... it's more usuful than the earlier version."
5,Rocket Propulsion Elements,"I'm only sixteen years old, and still only in algebra 2, but I bought this book because I am extremely fascinated with rocketry and I want to learn more about it. This will be a text that will be with me throughout my college years and beyond, and I feel that it was a great investment. The math and chemistry are a little intimidating thus far, but then again, where do they get the phrase, ""It's not rocket science!""? I realize it's a little ambitious for me, but if I systematically go through it I'm that much closer to experimental rocketry/spacecraft.The book is thoughtfully laid out, and exhaustively covers pretty much every area of rocket propulsion. I would recommend this book to any aspiring rocket scientist!"
4,good option,An easy read that has important review topics and associated questions. I would recommend. Only problem was actually more of a problem with apple_ the online version cannot be obatined on ipad due to lack of flash support.
2,not for board study,"Really not a very helpful book for board study. Many of the sections have major holes in terms of knowledge, including topics in the content specs. The questions at the end of the sections are minimally helpful. Honestly, I thought it was a waste of money. If I wasn't so stressed out, I wouldn't have bought it at all. I gave it away. Don't think it is useful for board prep and it certainly isn't useful for general knowledge."
3,Where's the real body of the music?,"I had some of this music back in the 50's, I'm refering mainly to Alfred Newman's works. This CD may have a lot of selections, but too many of the tracks are only a taste of the real music that was available. I was very dissapionted with All About Eve, it was mainly the title fanfare. I looked at the movie again just to see if it was my imagination, it wasn't. This cd has almost none of the actual music heard in the background. This is true of Song of Bernadette, the Razor's Edge. There is a much more complete version of these sound tracks around somewhere. I was able to do better ""lifting"" the music from the actual movie. All in all this a nice CD but it could have been much better."
1,heat up & shutdown - same problem,"I got the same problem here,After 1 1/2 years, the machine runs slow, perhaps due to heat issue. It is probably the cause of killing half of my RAM.This line of product from Sony is not recommended."
1,Overheated Sony,We also have experienced the overheat/shutdown problem. It was sent to Sony under warranty and returned with the same problem. To use this laptop you need to prop the back of the unit up on a book or something to allow air under it.
1,Sony VAIO laptop shutdown problem,"I thought I was buying a top of the line laptop, I love the large display, but that's the last positive thing I have to say about my PCG-GRZ660.Just over a year of owning it I started experiencing random shutdowns. Now at 1 1/2 years it shuts down constantly. The problem - OVERHEATING. Apparently it's a well known problem, and I can't get any support from Sony. Lookup ""Sony VAIO shutdown"" online and see all the folks that are experiencing overheating problems.I'm very disappointed with this laptop and would not recommend a Sony laptop to anyone.I think I will go back to ACER laptops, they have worked flawlessly in the past."
5,Wonderful,"In short, I really enjoyed this book. It started off like a typical private detective story: down-on-his-luck P.I. gets a visit from a beautiful and mysterious woman...the case seems straightforward enough, just find a missing family heirloom. The story quickly spirals into a crazy, weird story with occultists and scary gangsters, horrific murders and terrible things materializing out of noxious mist. Awesome Lovecraft tones and tie-ins...I loved it all. I liked the main character even, because Meikle really made this guy real. I'll definitely be buying the next one."
5,J'adore...,"On my shelves or in my Kindle, there are many books I started. Good, abandoned for lack of time. Less good, voluntarily left aside. And there's this book, for which I turned off my Kindle only to eat, sleep, and (unfortunately) go to work. ""The amulet"" is an incredible story, Adams a great character, this book a reworking of the detective genre, with an exhilarating Lovecraftian touch. I am a fan of Lovecraft, I am now a fan of detective fiction. And the chance with Mr. Meikle: he's a writer as prolific as talented... hours of great reading pleasures in perspective."
4,"Great for kids past the ""baby Bible"" stage","We got this book for our 4.5 year old. He had read his Baby/Children's Bible to pieces. Things we like about this Bible: More details from the stories, Pictures are less-cartoony. Things we don't like: some of the wording is awkward at times (we just improvise with our own wording every once in awhile). Overall, it's an awesome book for kids who are still being read to, but are past the little kiddie Bible stage. His 2 year old sister loves to listen along, the picture hold her attention as well."
3,Great Service,"The Picture Bible wasn't exactly what I was looking for, so the seller gave me a gift card for the full amount. Great service. I was just looking more for the actual comic strip type of Bible, rather than the different boxes with words underneath."
3,Not what I expected,"I ordered two Childrens bibles and this one was not as interesting to me as the other. Although after looking at it and thinking about what teens like, I believe a child who likes comic books would like this style. I will try it out on one of my grandchildren and see if it peaks their interest."
3,"Same switch as the N64, an idea for parents","If you have the N64 RF switch do not buy this, its exactly the same as the N64 switch! Anyone who has kids and an N64 might want to consider this for vacation purposes. Yes that's right, bring along the RF switch, a gamecube, controllers, games and your kids on your next long vacation. That way it will keep them quiet for a while, and with the RF switch, you always know that your gamecube will work with the hotel's televisions, because the only thing that this RF switch requires is a cable ready television. Meanwhile with the normal gamecube hookup it requires a more advanced television for the audio and video channels. Anyway the practical use of the RF switch is that it will work on any TV."
1,Get it only if you need it,"This is an RF adapter for your Gamecube. Yes. You may think wow a way to hook my GameCube up to my TV. However, an RF connection is the most ancient way on the planet to connect a game console to a TV! It was around with Nintendo's first system! It crams all the picture and sound together and results in a less clear picture and mono sound. Any TV that was purchased in the last 10 years or so should have a better available connection, Like A/V composite. (That's the Red and white jack for stero sound and yellow jack for video) Or even better, S-video (The big connector) with better picture seperation. However, the very BEST connection is component. It seperates all of the reds blues and greens and uses the white and red jacks for stereo sound. If you want to take advantage of Game Cubes progressive scan HD-TV 1080i capabilities on your HD-ready set, you should get the component connection cords that should be availble at the sytems launch."
5,Great Connection,"The first party RF connection is way better than any of the third parties. The connection is really good, and hooks to virtually any TV.Signal- 10/10 The signal is good, because it doesn't mess up any of the graphics. Play any game and you'll see there is no difference between the regular video/audio inputs (aka. Banana Jacks) and Nintendo's RF connection.Sound- 10/10 The sound is excellent, and there is no ""fuzzing"" in the audio. For those who have played 3rd party RF connections, you'll notice that on some games, the sound will frizz and make all types of wierd noises, which p***es me off.Get this if you don't have a TV (or can't play on one you have) that doesn't have Banana Jack inputs. If you have the RF modulator from N64 and an old RF cord (found on NES and SNES systems) then use those. They are the same as the new RF connectors."
2,IT'S The Same as the N64,It's the same as a N64 so if you have a N64 and it has a RF swich there is no need for this item
2,Atari 2600 used the same type of adaptor,"This adaptor has been around since the days of the Atari 2600, and hasn't really changed much since then.Of course if you need to use it, you need to use it. A piece of advice though, the N64 uses exactly the same connection, so if you have one for the N64, or need one for N64, buy just one, and seeing as how the N64 adaptor typically costs more (maybe it's the nifty box it comes in), buy the GameCube adaptor and save yourself some cash."
5,great,"This cord is the most convenient accessory for the gamecube I've seen yet. I would always get so frustrated when I took my cube to my friends house and their tv wouldnt have the right connections or their tv remote wouldn't have a video mode button so I ended up playing their ps2 (hiss). Plus my tv didn't have the adequate audio connections on it and I had to use my vcr which would be a pain to haul around since they don't make carrying cases for it (lol) But anyway, with this product, you hook it into the tv's cable, hook the other side to the antenna cable cord, and plug it in where the cord for the audio plugs went. And you don't have to use the video mode. It is so simple to hook in any body could do it. Although it takes a little longer to unhook than the audio plug, it is worth it. I haven't noticed any difference in the sound, gameplay, or graphics either. If you haul your cube around or if you hate that stupid video mode, 15 bucks is worth saving so much frustration and inconvenience."
2,crappy picture,"Great if u have an old tv that doesnt have the red, white and yellow input, but if u can use the red, white and yellow imputs or even better S-video or composite use those.the box itself is high qulity though..."
3,Could I use it to hook up a DVD to an old TV,"If so, it could be a best choice for my TV, DVD and Game Console"
5,Great for toddlers who love trains and cars!,"I love the wooden train tracks for the Thomas trains, and the road pieces for his cars and Bertie the Bus are just as great! I wish they would make more pieces with road on one side and track on the other instead of just being road or just being for trains. But since I could find any in my search for curved pieces, these are the next best thing!"
4,a set of slides,"Indeed, the book is in full colour. The text is accompanied by a plentitude of profusely drawn diagrams, that easily show the reader the task to be done or the point being made.The text is actually fairly minimal, in a style that may not necessarily appeal to some of you. There really is not a set of chapters of traditional text. Rather, Binder has chosen almost a slide show format. Each page is dominated by a diagram and bullet points therein. At the bottom of the page are a few short paragraphs expanding upon the diagram. This approach has the virtue of focusing your attention on the diagrams. The visuals are indeed strong. Binder has done a commendable job here.Binder's pedagogy works, to the extent that the subject matter is inherently visual - the user interface. But there were times when I yearned for an expanded textual discussion."
3,Good but not great...,"I bought these horns thinking they would sound louder and more unique than a normal horn from the factory. These were upsetting because they came with no instructions on how to wire the relay, or the horns. The horns did not even come with wires, they just had standard wire connector ends on them. These did not impress me because I was expecting water resistant or waterproof connectors since these are mounted by the tire on my car. The unique sound I was expecting from a hella horn was not there, these sound exactly like factory horns you would find on your every day car. turns out if you want anything unique and loud you need to purchase the more expensive horns from hella."
5,Good as original equipment,"Sound is just like original equipment on German cars, very easy to install on a BMW as the connector is the same. however i also had a set installed in a VW Golf MK1V the connector had to be modified. If your car is German you should not need to install the included relay as your car is already outfitted with one, If your goal is to give pedestrians a heart attack with the horn blast then you need to select higher decibel."
4,Worked great for my ATV,"I needed to add a street kit to my Polaris ATV's so I bought 2 pairs of these to get us going. True, these do not come with instructions but I simply looked up a wiring scheme for a car and a auto-parts run later I was installing the horns. I wired up from scratch and installed a relay and horn switch and the whole thing ended up looking like a stock install. the horn color matched my quad color as well. When I honk these mothers MAN are they loud! If I'm ever on the street and use these I'm definitely gonna get some respect.The two-tone notes end up sounding like a regular car horn and the plastic will resist the mud being slung around by the tires.Great product.Big Red"
5,A Triumph,"This book was greatly informative of what modern Africa is like. Many of us have misconceptions or just a vague knowledge of the so-called ""Dark Continent"". Harris opens it up for us. I found his courage and his adventurous spirit to be both touching and inspirational. My imaginings manifested themselves this year when I treked through Spain on the Camino de Santiago- where I met with and engaged the culture, the elements and my own will. The process of discovery and adventure outside commercial tourisim is the REAL way to travel. With travel we change the way we think of where we live ... this book encourages this philosophy and will hopefully provoke people to take some time and go off to discover something. I encourage all readers to discover this book. It will challenge you and the enrichment you recieve may surprise. Thank you, Harris."
2,Over-rated,"The Seeds have one great song. That's it. Everything else is a variation of that. Further, Sky Saxon is perhaps the most undistinguished vocalist coming out of the garage. This smacks of blasphemy to garage-heads, but it's true. Bad vocalists are one thing. Saxon is another. His vocals just lie there like a wet dog in the corner. Boring. Roslie of the Sonics has nothing to fear from Saxon."
2,so-so,"Unless you are old enough to remember seeing these guys perform live...as I did.....you probably wont be impressed with the quality of the recordings or the musicianship...these guys are ""garage band"" at best...They were ok in concert....just your average garage band who had a hit record...The hit ""Pushin too hard""...is the high point of the cd....the rest of stuff is mere filler....Back then...same as now...there was a reason why bands like this never achieved superstar status...they lack that magical charisma to lock you in."
3,Seeds are starting to grow.,"The Seeds were a legendary ""flower punk"" band in the 1960s. ""Flower punk"" is a term that was coined especially for the Seeds, to describe their music, which is a combination of garage band and psychedelic. The band is best known for their one real hit, the all-time classic ""Pushin' Too Hard"". This CD features the band first two albums, The Seeds and A Web of Sound. The first album features ""Pushin' Too Hard"", plus the great songs ""Can't Seem to Make You Mine"" and ""Try to Understand"". The rest of the material is uneven. The best song on the second album (A Web of Sound) is ""Mr. Farmer"". Again, the rest of the album is pretty uneven. The second most noteworthy song is the 14 and a half minute long ""Up in Her Room"", which was the longest rock song ever recorded at the time. This epic ode to making love is actually the second best thing on the album, surprisingly never getting boring. Three stars for this CD, overall."
5,Garage Music at its Finest,"I had always loved the Seeds but never owned any of their musci until I bought this one. It was a wonderful throwback to the 60's. ""Pushin"" Too Hard"" was always a favorite of mine (the Bangles to a great version live).You'll think about the 60's with a smile when you listen to ""Pushing Too Hard"" - especially if you don't have any of their other albums."
5,Great family film,"This is a great movie for familys to watch , it deals with faith and hope and realy shows what family is all about!"
4,Good Story & Great Songs!,"Jake's Corner was an inspiration movie out of a vist from Jeff Santos (Son of Cub's Star Ron Santos). The Storyline if good with colorful characters. The music selections, many from B.J. Thomas who sings Rock'n Roll Lullaby and When the Hero Dies. This DVD has a special segment specifically on B.J. Thomas and his work on the film to include site filming and the aforementioned songs.Overall, great entertainment and good storyline."
4,Jake's Corner - a Refreshing Stop,"Jake's Corner is a very enjoyable movie, especially when I realized that I had been to the REAL Jake's Corner which is an old Stage Coach Stop just northeast of Phoenix. It is still in operation and is just like it is depicted in the movie, comfortable and homey with good food. Richard Tyson and Diane Ladd were very good but it is a young actor from Phoenix that steals the show. It is good family entertainment with family values at heart thanks to Jeff Santo. As always, B. J. Thomas does a great job with the music soundtrack. I highly recommend it!"
3,Sturdy but strips out,"Pretty sturdy bike rack. It's nice because it has a lock built in and tilts down to let you in to the back of the SUV. The bad thing is the collars strip out. You have to keep moving the collars around to get a good grip. One time driving I notice my bike kept sliding up, as the collar had no grip and was twisting. A square design rather than a tube may work better. It'll last a couple years before the collars start moving. At first I would recommend this, but now I would say there are more reliable racks out there for about the same money."
4,swagman,this product is very easy to use and is secure.My wife is able to put the rack on the car and load the bikes by herself. The only problem I have is that the straps that secure the bikes tend to strip out. I have had to use the third carrier straps. I would recommend this product to anyone
4,Great for kids...to watch,"I got this game becasue my 4 year old LOVES Scooby Doo, and he would watch me play. Now, I'm not a gaming expert, but I have beaten DOOM (not bad for a girl), but this game is not easy. Although some parts are easy to get through, there are some parts that have taken me hours of trying. My son loves to watch me play, but I don't even know how a young teen could do some of the tricky maneuvers. It's great for kids to watch, but unless they are awesome at gaming, it's better for adults to play."
5,Good Clean Fun!!!!!,"Scooby Doo Unmasked is definately my favorite video game. It's cute funnyand just challenging enough so i dont get bored. If youre the type of person that plays video games 24/7 and your farorite game is something like bloodgusher 3 you'd think its stupid, but its really funny and perfect for scooby doo fans. It's a good buy, Youll want to play it over and over!!!!"
1,What Happened?,"So far I have not been able to get this game to work properly. I understand that it's a used game,I have purchased used games from Amazon before so I was rather disappointed that this one isn't working."
4,Does a fine job but could be better,"I guess I expected too much from the technology, but the stabilization is fine at a slow rocking of the boat or a troll speed. But if the boat is rocking too much they seem almost as bad as a regular pair."
4,"not very well written. But, great content.","I think that this is a great book. The only problem with it might be, that its not written very well. It seems to drag at times and one might feel that its not worth the time. But, it is. This is one book which confronts you directly about who you really are and who you think you are. It reveals the actual meaning of your thoughts and the actual intentions of your actions. Its quite an eye opener into human psychology, in general, and you will see patterns of your own behaviour in his descriptions of situations. It brings you out from the illusion where you are a saint, an extremely nice person; where whatever you do is good, and where you are always thinking about others first and then about yourself. Its worth it in the end."
5,Supermag is Super!!,This is an awesome toy. My daughter (age 6) received it for Christmas and absolutely loves it - she learns how to construct things and has also learned a lot about how magnets work with this. It is also a blast for adults too.
5,Creativity Galore!,My daughter Natalie thinks it is a cool toy because it has magnets and you can make all sorts of neat things; such as pretend mechanical devices!
2,But what about Poser!,"In agreement with other customer previews, Shamms Mortier has written a book not for the general Poser user, but of his own likes and dislikes. As his own graphical skills don't appear to be very polished (I am being kind here!) he shows his limitations by crude examples. By far, the largest drawback to this book is the fact that if you do not have other software (ie: Ray Dream Studio - as the author MUST have!) then the book is next to useless to a Poser (only) user."
3,good obscure gangster film,"I stumbled upon this film at a local video store. Aside from Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent, most of the actors are pretty much unknown. The plot of the story is solid and believable, but the picture quality is very poor (and this is the DVD version!) and the soundtrack and the time-to-time nudity makes it seem like a cheesy porno flick. Joe Pesci's character, Joey is simalar to the phsyco character he portrayed in ""Goodfellas"". Another unique aspect is that the main hitman is African-American (Keith Davis), pretty rare for a Mafia movie. Based in New Jersey it's pretty much a 90 minute episode of ""The Sopranos"" before the series was even thought of! This would make a great remake. If you can survive the poor picture quality, you'll probably enjoy this film."
3,"OK,low-budget,crime drama..co-starring a vintage Pesci.","On the video box it shows Pesci with a toothpick in his mouth,looking more like nowadays Pesci,also making him out to be the star. ....First off,he co-stars...second he doesn't look like that on the box...he's alot younger. The movie itself is OK,but it is very low-budget. .........I don't think it paved the way for Goodfellas,but it certainly paved the way for Joe Pesci. I wonder if Joe at the time (32 years old in 1975) ever thought he would be a superstar 15 years down the road and winning an Oscar for Goodfellas. ...Nothing is sweeter than the success of a late bloomer...very inspiring."
1,Pure Dreck but the Fashions are a Hoot,"I can't believe some here loved this laughably inept, sub-Scorsese dreck. Badly written, directed, and acted, its only value is to remind you how good the classics of the mob genre are in comparison. The final shootout, which someone here raves over, is especially hilarious. The gunmen who whack the wedge cut-wearing guido ""hero"" really are the gang that couldn't shoot straight. It's fun to check out the 70s hairdos (Frank Vincent's poodle cut is a hoot) but that's about the only redeeming feature about this C-grade flick."
3,Amon Duul II - 'Wolf City' (Repertoire) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1972, 'Wolf City' was the German krautrocker's fifth record. Nice remastering job on the reissue CD, I must mention. Probably one of AD II's more conventional albums, but STILL giving the old school fans pretty much what they have come to expect. Tracks here that had me sit up and take notice were the catchy ""Green Bubble Raincoated"", ""Jailhouse Frog"", ""Wie Der Wind Am Ende Einer Strasse"" and ""Deutsch Nepal"". Vocalist Renate Knaup really seems to shine on this title. A should-have."
2,Nice one but big,I liked the ear rings a lot but they were not the size i expected.they were little big but suited me.
3,for older then 5,"I purchased this book for my 5 year old son. The pictures were a bit scary for him, and he has yet to let me read him the book. i loved the Bernstein Bears as a child and do plan on purchasing more in the future."
4,"Decent kit, really small and portable, but hard to access all items","It is cheaply made plastic but it has a decent amount of first aid items, though it is hard to rummage through since it's so compact. Not bad but I really want something bigger with more items."
3,Well done but proceed with caution,"This book has some lovely art and is quite well-written for the age group; however, a parent should preview the content before reading it to a youngster who may be sensitive. I'm talking ""Ol' Yeller"" tears here. It can be effective but make sure you know where you're taking your youngster before the trip begins."
1,Not for young children,"Like another reviewer commented, parents should preview this book before reading it to young children. I read it to my 3 and 5 year olds today, and ended up having to make up a happier ending when they kept asking, ""where is Morgan's mother?"" (Morgan's mother had left him to die at the bottom of a cliff because she couldn't get to him.) This book seems to teach that if you make a bad choice, the consequence is that you can't come back to your family. Not really the lesson I want my kids to learn."
2,Its not that good,"I remeber when I first read about the band, I was intrigued and bought the album. I think the album has its moments like the first 3 tracks, but then after that it kind of goes downhill...It just seems like the band gets stuck in a monotonous rythem and it just stays their, in other words, it gets boring...If you wanna get hardcore by girls, check out L7, they destroy this band."
2,Its not that good..,"I remeber when I first read about the band, I was intrigued and bought the album.

(The review below is mine, I had done it anonymous first)"
2,Not such a gem.,"This movie had it's moments, and it was worth watching once, but I wouldn't call it a ""gem"". Hard to see where that adjective fits in, but to each their own.Not bad, not good, just an average gay themed movie."
1,"Disturbing and in a very sad way, kind of pathetic","This film is an aimless story about a guy recently disowned by his family. Sadly, that's the only thing about the character that inspires sympathy. The one facet in which this movie succeeds is showing a young guy with absolutely no self respect and his series of increasingly dangerous and drug addled trysts while he plans to kill himself on Christmas eve. Yes...it's that depressing.This movie represents everything that's wrong and stereotypical about gay cinema - dark, depressing and self-absorbed characters. Poignant only in its depravity."
2,HOUSEBOY,THIS MOVIE IS FAIR. ENTERTAINING BUT NOT A GREAT MOVIE. AFTER LOOKING ONCE IT IS NOT A MOVIE I WOULD WATCH AGAIN.
4,Housebore,Had high hopes for the movie and was left short as for the story line it leaves you wanting more and to find out what happens with the house boy
3,Not one I'd watch twice.,"This was an OK film. There were just times when the ""acting"" was a bit forced. It left me feeling like a stoner watching friends, instead of any real emotion. It was 'cute' and 'edgy' but not otherwise note worthy. I'm sure it was big at Sundance - those movies are usually eerie and off-putting."
3,Delve a little deeper,"Interestingly, not one of the reviews of this film gets close to identifying the critique of gay culture that is its raison d'etre. One could argue that makes the film something of a failure, but I'm not so sure. Maybe it says more about the gay audience. One is tempted to conclude that if it's not soft porn or romantic wish-fulfillment then they're just not buying it. However, if you're open to something more, and something different, then you might just appreciate The Houseboy. It's slow in spots and the acting isn't great, but it's an unsettlingly accurate portrait of the demoralizing effects of the merry-go-round of mindless sex, and it has something worthwhile to say about the things that get lost along the way. For all it's faults, it's ultimately as sweet as it is dark, and somewhat more profound than it might at first seem."
3,A mediocre but interesting low-budget thriller.,"Considering the ultra-low budget of this film, it is not as bad as one might expect. Buddy Baer does a good job in the title role, as a huge Spanish conquistador from the 15th century who is revived by a lightning strike after 500 years in suspended animation and proceeds to terrorize a rural area in northern California. He had a reputation as a mean SOB to begin with, and he continues to live up to it. Moral: People don't change."
4,Giant Fun!,"This is the type of film you'd see on your favorite horror host show. ""Giant from the Unknown"" is a very good film that gets overlooked a lot. If you ever find the film on TV..watch it! or better yet, buy it!..and see for yourself, that this film is truly different than your average cheese horror film. Highly Recommended!"
4,The notes,"I read the novel Tess, not the notes on it. However, I did use cliffs notes for a book report to help with the character analyses and themes and such for the book. Cliffs notes was very helpful, even after reading the novel! Useful thing to have."
2,surprises,"this book wasn't the first choice on my list to read. it was very boring, and very wordy. the only thing really good about this book was some of the twists and turns."
4,Great! Except...,"The machine is fast, light and small. The keyboard works, but the mousepad has some problems. First of all, it is automatically programmed to have all these functions that they don't tell you about. Such as, to exit something you have to tap in the corner of the pad. Well, because they don't tell you about that, you could be typing an email and oops! it's gone. Even when you eliminate all but the scrolling, it clicks itself out. It is very annoying!"
3,Still not through the book,"The book arrived quickly and in decent condition. It's taking me forever to get through the book though. It is interesting to a point, but there are so many climbers mentioned that it is difficult to keep them all straight. I'm a fairly good comprehensive reader and this book is the first mountain book that has me struggling. It might be because I am not as familiar with women climbers as with the men, but I think it is more in the way the book is written. That being said, so far I would still recommend it because it focuses on female climbers which makes it different than most."
5,One of the best compilation of rap ever produced,"One word could be used to describe this CD. Awesome. This CD is like a musical history of the Bay Area rap scene. From ""I Got 5 on It"" by Luniz to my personal favorite ""Pimp of the Year"" by Dru Down, every song has its' own personality and bumpin' beat. Many of these rappers the public normally doesn't get to hear because of lyrical content, but this is your chance to experience the Bay Area rap scene which is easily one of the best in the world. I say check it out. If you like rap at all, you will definately love this classic. Representin' the V, Vallejo CA, word out."
3,SINGER,"Good productI have tried this PA system and amazinly has very loud speakers for its size, quality of sound can use a little improvement, very limited effects control.You are getting what you pay for, I don't consider this a profesional PA but can put you out of trouble when needed for audio presentation and maybe for birhday parties where quality of sound is not that important. I always love to hear a very clear and clean sound with very little reverb effects but friendly for your ears. loud sound is not always the best selection.Edwin."
2,Not a Factory Assembly Instruction Manual,"The publisher of this book has removed all the page title blocks and the part numbers. If you look closely on some pages you can see shadows where this information was covered before copying. In my opinion, this is not a copy of the assembly manual that the factory used. I have service and overhaul manuals, parts catalogs, etc. for this year truck and I was hoping to add to this information with the details of assembly. This book doesn't do it. If you will be satisfied with pictures and part descriptions without page numbers or apparent organization, OK. Otherwise, don't waste your money and time.I have no issues with the seller. They responded to my concerns and refunded my money after I shipped the book back to them at my cost."
3,Eh?,The funniest parts of the movie were the clips of his family members. Most of the time I felt like I was watching bits and pieces of his old comedy acts.
5,Hilarious...Pure Genius!!,"I don't knock Eddie Griffin for his language nor do I feel that people who curse are ignorant. I curse like a sailor but I am a Junior at UC-Berkeley, one of the most prestigious universities on this planet. Its just comedy, I find it freakin' hilarious because alot of the things he said were true. Some of the things he said, many would agree on but would be too afraid to say it themselves. I give the man much props for that stand up because it was five star comedy!"
3,Sorry Ed,His stand up was a little above average. But the documentary parts dragged the show down. I love Eddie Griffin but I have to admit I fell asleep during this one!
1,"Does Hershey want its own version of the ""New Coke"" fiasco?","Hershey's silver can Dutched cocoa uses to be one of ""go to"" standards, I'm very disappointed with the Special Dark cocoa. Bring the original back!"
1,Hershey Said It Was Even Better - NOT!,"I also used the silver can version until discontinued last spring. I contacted Hershey to see why they changed it and what was the difference. They said they had improved it to give it a richer, more intense flavor. I suggest they go back to the drawing board or better yet back to the silver can.I make one of the best devil's food cake around, rich chocolate, moist, etc. even after freezing. (And the chocolate pies were just as enjoyable.) Now it is dry, lacks any flavor (icing as well) and is a great dissapointment to all.It doesn't rate one star!"
2,"An awful ""update""","I don't know if the change was finances-driven (isn't it almost always) or simply product development trying to justify their existence, but Hershey's new version of dutch processed cocoa is new but not remotely improved. The old Hershey's dutch cocoa was a top-notch product for those on a budget -- great flavor, no harsh or bitter flavors, no interruption of texture. This cocoa guts most of that success with its strange twang (cocoa may taste earthy, but not dirty) and powdery texture. For goodness sake Hershey, take a page from Coke and just say no to ""new"" Hersheys Special Dark Cocoa."
3,"A good dark cocoa, but WAY overpriced here",I used this Special Dark cocoa to make both a cake and chocolate frosting with good results. I was shocked to see the price Amazon is selling this cocoa for--I bought the same sized container at Target for under $3.00.
3,Not that great,"I have a recipe for Hot Fudge Pudding Cake that calls for Dutch Process Cocoa. I can't find it in the rural area that I live, but I did find this Hershey's Special Dark. It gave my cake a strange gray/black muddy color that I think is very unappealing.......tasted OK, but it's color is off-putting."
5,Love the special dark flavor,"I use the Special Dark cocoa in recipes and hot chocolate, and we love the full, dark, rich flavor. I was very disappointed when I tried to purchase more and found it unavailable."
5,Dark Chocolate powder,This is a hard to find item in the stores. Dark chocolate powder is good for lots of things and this allows me to add artificial sugar to taste instead of calorie heavy sugar in pre-sweetened cocoa. Arrived quickly and well packed.
1,Hideous!,"I, too, used ""Silver Can"" Hershey's European Style Cocoa for many years. I ordered it by the case from Hershey, because no local stores stocked it. It had a delightful flavor and aroma, and the color was very dark, but not unnaturally black like this stuff. Hot Cocoa made with Special Dark looks like dirt, rather than chocolate, and is nearly flavorless in comparison with Silver Can cocoa. I'm only sorry I have to give it one star in order to review it. BTW, I found a very nice dutch process cocoa--not as good as Silver Can, but very close--from an online spice shop located in Colorado. It's a bit more expensive than Hershey, but not cost prohibitive. Haven't bought a can of Hershey's cocoa since."
1,Absolutely dreadful,"I gave this one star because it is impossible to give it zero. As others have mentioned, the old, silver box ""European Style Dutched Cocoa"" was my standard for any recipe that involved cocoa - cake, brownies, cookies, anything. Then a few years ago, they replaced it with this crap. And it is crap, absolute crap. The distinctively darker color that resulted from using the old cocoa is gone, as is the taste. Now it's worse in comparison to even the original hershey's cocoa.There is absolutely no reason to buy this product."
3,From the back cover,"The hunters attack...There was an eruption of noise, the crack of a shot, flat and hard, and in the same instant, the herd matriarch, not trumpeting, not making any sound, just covering the ground at great speed, the dust flying beneath her dancing feet. And behind her, half a dozen others, big beasts with their trunks curled underneath their tusks and their heads high.Another shot sounded, and another, a whole ripple of fire. One elephant checked, another down, but the rest of them kept going, driving straight for the Land Rover and the two trucks..."
4,Not the movie,"A believable account of what first contact with extraterrestrial beings may be like. Sagan tells an interesting story of an astronomer and how a message from space effects her life and Earth's. He has arch-typical doomsday sayers in the book, but I guess in actuality, there would be some. He has an interesting take on theology and science. Being a scientist, and a agnostic, Sagan's ideas make me want to look for God in my own work. Of course, the book is better than the movie because you can get into the heads of the characters. As usual, there are significant changes in the movie. Finally, the ended in the book, is extremely thought provoking."
5,"This book is not just for fun to read, has much more worth.","I saw the movie first, then read this book. You must see the movie first because the story in this book is so deep than the movie's. Actually, I have no religion, but this book made me think of my faith and also between science and religion. In my opinion, Carl doesn't deny any religion itself, but he tried to convey what we should be thought about ourselves, the earth and the universe as long as we are given our life. To me, this book was not just for read but gave me the chance to look into myself and my future. I really thank late Dr. Sagan for his great contributions for us."
3,Ending still unsatisfying,"I'm glad I saw the film first.I read the book to find details missing from the movie, and I was somewhat disappointed. The text lacked the excitement that I expected, and the writing was long-winded at times. Not enough hard SF details for me."
3,IS THIS ALL THERE IS???,"Somebody pinch me, I must be dreaming: The book is good, especially if you HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET!!! Imagine to my surprise that I saw the movie in the theatre first and then was given a copy of this book: I read it, liked it when I had my trusty Webster's Dictionary on hand and so on and so forth... But, considering as any 16 year old would, between book and movie, the latter seemed to win out-- I had only one major query out of the entire experience... The blind physicist, Dr. Kent Clark (played magnificentlly by the talented actor William Fichtner) was a much-needed key in tying the emotional matter to the scientific-- His character and Ellie (Jodie Foster) had much more on screen character and even flow that with McConaughey's Joss-- It was believable, a good pairing, and would have done a book in this subject a world of good HAD HIS CHARACTER BEEN FEATURED IN THE BOOK!! then again, that's just my opinion."
3,So-so,"I decided to read the book before renting the movie. The story line is pretty good but the ending is weak; the outcome of the ""contact"" is unsatisfying and a surprising, but irrelevant, revelation about the heroine is used to provide a philosophical last paragraph. The book was written in the 80's but set at the end of the millenium, giving us the opportunity to review Carl's predictions. Not many have come to fruition. The National Enquirer, ABC, NBC and CBS are all still here. The Soviet Union and apartheid -era South Africa aren't. We don't have a two-term female president...er, okay, a split decision on that one...and there are no millionaire retirement homes orbiting the earth. The strike-out rate for Carl's predictions tended to make me think his predictions for first contact with aliens was probably way off, too. This is the kind of book you can read on a long flight or during a vacation, but it's a stretch to tag it a ""classic"" of any genre."
5,A Compilation of Sagan's Non-fiction Woven into a Story,"If you had one Carl Sagan book to read, thiswould probably be it. It reads as if it werea ""Best of Sagan"" containing many of hisnon-fiction themes in a science fiction setting.Emphasis should be placed upon the ""science""in the ""science fiction"". While it may containtechnobabble, it's believable technobabblebecause so much of it is based upon Sagan'sreal-life work.All of his favorites are here: the dodecahedron,the SETI project, commentary on superpower mistrust,who speaks for the Earth, and the conflict betweenreligious and scientific belief systems.It does get a bit heavyhanded with the recurringthread about the persecution of astronomerswho are so much smarter than everyone else(another Sagan favorite).I enjoyed the fact that Ellie Arroway was figuringout the problems of the universe, but could notresolve her own family problems."
2,"An ok novel, but not great","I saw the movie before reading the novel. In the novel, Ellie Arroway isn't as annoying as the movie's Ellie Arroway: she is not constantly criticizing religion. The movie spent too much time focusing on the question of religion versus science. It is a theme in the novel, but the theme is not as in-your-face as in the movie (for example, Hadden and his Preachnix device).Unfortunately, the novel is very awkward at introducing backstory: a character is introduced and then the next few paragraphs give a quick biographical sketch of the character. Personally, I'd rather have the backstory of a character introduced in pieces and in surprises. For example, Palmer Joss could have been a much more interesting character if his backstory were introduced much slowly. These sketches should have been editted out.The last chapter of the novel, was much better than the movie's end. It would've been nice to see what Ellie did with that information from her mother's letter."
3,MEh,"Being a fan of Carl, I was expecting something a little more. The general idea of the galactic highway was very cool, but the book was too long on the set up, and when they get to their destination, there is maybe a chapter of nothing exciting at all. I am very disappointed."
4,"Excellent book, mediocre quality of copy I recieved.","What a wonderful book! After having read it I find myself wanting to send a copy to every loved one I've been separated from in my life. Whether it's science, curiosity, or humanism that brings you to read reviews of this book, don't let is pass. Just get it and read it and let it change you. :) Peace"
2,Perhaps I should try again....,"I stopped reading this book right smack in the middle. I was wasting my time. It confused the hell out of me! I would read a page, and then I would have no idea what I just read. Well, I was younger then. I'll try reading this again in a couple years."
2,Silly,"Sagan rejects traditional religion and then posits science fiction to replace it. Instead of a distant god, a very distant, fantasy civilization speaks to man from the great beyond. Ho-hum. Sagan proves he is just another flying saucer nut who hopes some alien people from way, way out there (""billions and billions"" miles away?) will eventually come and save mankind. He substitutes one wild unscientific premise for another. Reads like the work of a man who would be defending the medieval church if he had lived during that time because it is clear that he has a strong mystical bend of mind; hardly the temperament that lends itself to clear thinking. Fun movie, but then, so was ""Star Wars."""
1,"Save yourself the time, and enjoy the movie..","5 hours I'll never get back in my lifetime... The movie is DEFINITELY far better an entertainment value. The book itself is worth using it in the forest, instead of leaves.... You can tear half the pages out and still get bored reading this poorly written page turner... There's nothing of added value; and as for the ""different"" ending.. there's no such thing.. the movie's ending is merely a subset of what the book offers... (in the book 5 people travel to Vega...) but the book adds very little to the plot or subtext... the book is a throw-away..."
3,A Disappointment,"Althought I have found may of the works by Carl Sagan enlighting this book was not one of them.I found it boring to the extreme and could of been written in a better style.Carl spends too much time explaining the science of everything and not enough time on the story. I find myself skipping over pages because the subject matter is dull and over my head. It was like reading a text book.I do like the some of the arugments between Arroway and Joss and the rather sad ending, but Sagan could of done a better job"
2,Carl Sagan is no writer.,"This book is not a very good one. Carl Sagan does a great job in putting science into science fiction, but leads you up to a terrible climax. If this was the only thing wrong with it then I would have given this book a higher rating, but Sagan enraged me by making all religious people out to be freaks and slack-jawwed yockles. This really insulted me. I feel Mr. Sagan ruined a perfectly boring book by his attacks at religion. If this book was written when THE ORIGINS OF SPECIS came out the Christians would have attacked CONTACT!!"
2,The movie is better,"This is one of those odd cases where the movie is better than the book. I saw the movie first and enjoyed it. Then I read the book. The book is drawn out and slow moving, the characters are poorly developed and it is full of Sagan's political agenda that detracts from what should be a fun sci-fi novel."
3,Not much better than film,"When I saw the film I felt there was a lot left out. The film's narrative seemed disjointed and rushed. The book while it does fill in some of those glossed in details has its own pacing problems. After spending pages and pages explaining why something can't be done, this road block is suddenly gone. Then there's the ultimate ""trip"" to Vega is just as disappointing in the book (though certainly more coherent than the cinematic version)."
1,Did Y'all Have A Different Version of this Book?,"I can't believe all the 5 star reviews of this title. I've read a lot of books, and this is only the 2nd one I've found that had almost no redeeming qualities. The biggest problem I had were the charecters. Not once did I care what happened to any of them, and the spice girls have more depth. The idea behind the book was okay, incredibly overdone, but okay. Now if only the author had concentrated on that instead of spending 10 pages telling me about a religious debate. After the first 200 pages I realized it wasn't going to get any better, and the only thing that kept me reading was the fact that I wanted to know what the message said (and even then I had to start skipping pages at a time to make it through). All in all, this book sux."
3,I dunno...,"OK... I read this book few weeks ago, and I didn't really like it. After reading all the reviews, i read it once more, and I still didn't get the idea.First of all, this book has nothing special. Have you ever read 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke? The idea of Grand Central Station and extraterrestrial intelligence 'cultivating' civilization was already mentioned in 2001. The 'Machine' is just like the black monolith which transfers Dave Bowman to... somewhere. And the part when the alien (who disguised as Ellie's dad) talks about Beethoven and peace stuff, I couldn't help smiling. I think it is ridiculous and funny, or rather cute. And after all, why would the alien stay away from human being when the Five already visited them? To be honest, I think the whole story is a big HOAX. I didn't give one or two stars though, because I liked the last part. It was unlike other Science Fiction novels."
3,"for the first time in history, the movie was better.","contact is one of my favorite movies. it has content, something lacking from most hollywood drivel. i figured, the universal rule is that the book is always better than the movie, so i should read the book. i was vastly dissapointed.the movie seemed to be more well thought out, have a more consistant theme, and have more parallelisms and symbolisms with respect to religion and science. there were differences on the order of detail, up to major plot changes, and in each and every case, i thought that the movie version was far superior.this is, without a doubt, a rare case where the movie is better."
4,Carl Sagan's only fiction novel.,"I had read a bunch of Sagan's nonfiction, and was sure he had some fictionout there, but when I read this novel I found that I was wrong. A very goodand imaginative work by a real Astrophysicist, man makes contact withaliens through SETI and build the device the aliens give them plans to sothat first contact can be achieved. The ending is not what you wouldthink, but is still very good. I would recommend this book to fans ofArthur C Clarke, as it is in the mold of 2001 and other books which portrayan alien culture as so advanced as to be beyond our understanding."
5,A great cosmologist can also write great fiction.,"Normally, I don't read fiction, but when the author is Carl Sagan, I stand up and take notice. And Contact is well worth it to. What makes it even better is Sagan's accurate scientific detail that applies to the situation he is creating, although few people can appreciate this. Much like watching Star Trek, the scientific inaccuracies don't get in the way of a great series, but it sure would've enchanced it more!"
3,"Good, but the ending I could have done without","This is one of those rare occasions where I actually liked the movie better than the book, though not by much. Most other times movies have been based on books, the movies have come across as complete trash - the plot not what it had been in the novel. This time, the *basics* of the plot stayed the same, although there were some changes made for the movie.Overall, I did like it, but as the summing line said: I could have done without the ending."
4,Enjoyable and insightful,"This book was written well (it wasn't breathtaking prose, but it was sturdy and understated.)about mortality and life.The plot is not merely about making contact with extraterrestrial beings, but emphasizes the relationship of humans between each other and the infinte quest to understand the mammoth question every person asks himself: ""why?"". Alongside the factoids (which he manages to explain in a clear manner), he has woven a story of characters that we sympathize with and relate to. He intertwines religion and science, facts and faith to come upon an understanding that it is somehow connected to all of us and everything we know. The only drawback is that towards the end, there is a lot of scientific jargon, which can become a little tedious. But overall, this is not simply science fiction, it is a book on the human condition."
3,Confusing yet enthralling,"I chose to read this book for my book report in school. It has a captivating plot about science and religion intertwined in one story. Why can't religion and science be in the same book. I think religion proves science and science proves religion. Why can't God have created and follow the rules of science.The story had a great plot and had good meaning, but was bland and dull through one third of the book. Carl Sagan would go off for pages talking about things that are irrelevant to the story and disrupts the flow of the events.All in all, the ""Contact"" was good, but could be revised and be made into a more captivating and intriguing story."
3,"See the Movie, much better than the book","read the book after seeing the movie 7 times. surprised how much better the movie's plot was. Sagan's vision of the aliens as bored galactic engineers was a real let down compared to the movies vision of the aliens as enlightened and spiritual. The whole treatment of the spiritual angle, though, is confused in both the movie and the book"
4,CONTACT Is An Awesome Book!,"CONTACT is a great book. The main character, Ellie, is a radio astronomer looking for extraterrestrial intelligence, and the result makes all heck break loose. She makes enemies, is betrayed, is double-crossed, yet manages to make some friends along the way. CONTACT is not only about aliens and space and technology, but a book which makes us realize just how tiny we are. Wonderfully crafted by Carl Sagan, creator of COSMOS; CONTACT feeds the dreamer in all of us. Or, depending on who you are and what you believe, the person just waiting for some proof."
2,Good idea but...,The movie was excellent. So that got me wanting to read the book. Bought it and started it right away. I was disappointed. I just read half the book cause Carl Sagan can't right worth anything! His idea was something I could never imagine it's just the way he wrote bore me and I quit reading it. I wanted to finish it to compare the ending to the movie but the guy just dragged me page after page and I couldn't stand it anymore. Go see the movie.
3,"Worthy thoughts, but not the best gem in the heap","I think this is a three or four-star book. I have mixed sentiments. The first time I read it, I remember being impressed by the witty dialogue on the issue of religion and science, the reasons to doubt as opposed to the reason to believe. Religion and believe makes up an important theme of the book, and Sagan's insights (as expressed through the characters) are important and still useful. But in another sense, Sagan is merely substituting a more impersonal, science friendly religion for what he perceives to be an older-time worn formula for religion. His caricature of religion seems to omit that anyone could have a liberal sense of religion, and focuses mostly on the fundamentalist view. I just wish the book weren't so ""chatty."" Honestly I think it could have been edited to be much shorter, more succinct. In a nutshell, I think there are important themes of religion and science here, and that it is a still a worthy read - if also a mildly flawed one."
3,Slow moving with weak ending,"The book was moderately interesting, but for the most part was slow moving, even plodding, and the ending was very weak--""proof"" that God exists appears in the value for pi"
4,the best science - fiction bookthat i've read,"This is not a simple science-fiction book, although to some it may seem so. This boo"
3,A book missing the Contact points,"I agree that this novel was creative . . . for a non-fiction writer. It provided an excellent basis for one of the best movies I've seen of late. I am definitely not a conformist, however, and I don't regret to say that when Mr. Sagan presented his opinions of the different factions of life, he didn't consider a valid arguement: that science and religion are inherently inseperable. The novel is presented like a prolonged debate between the theological line of thinking and the equally unlimited world of the scientific reality. It is essentially an arguement, although it appears to be passive. The characters in the novel exemplify the limitations of both lines of thinking by not allowing them to intermingle. It places a stone wall where maybe none is needed. Yeah, the book makes you think, as you can tell by my comments, but by no means does it represent existance as it likely is, only a few ideas of what it could be."
3,Big fan,"I was a big fan of the movie and wanted Carl to expand the world even further. However, it makes for dull and difficult reading. It takes a while to get into it, but it warms up in the end. I guess I like it spoon-fed to me in visual form."
5,The best book by Carl Sagan,"Definetly this book proves that Carl Sagan it's better at writing fiction than science, this book it's amazing!, way better than the movie itself, it shows more deepness, altought the descriptions are too long, they are entertaining, there is no much dialouge in the first three or four chapters,but the descriptions are very interesting on the way that Carl Sagan does, this is why this is his best book ever!, also what i loved about this book it hows it describes religion, sexism,well everything, but i don't recommended to a ""closed minded"" reader and for a very hard scinece one, because when they make contact to alien beings it's on 1999, this book was written in 1985, so please forget the real facts and enjoy this book."
5,It Rocks the Casbah,"I have seen the movie, Contact, about 20 times, and every time i watch it i love it. I am on my second reading of the book which has made me think a lot more. It had made me more interested in the universe - how infinite it is, how beautiful it is...and it is shown beautifully in both the movie and the book."
3,It would have made a good philosophical short story.,"This would have made an excellent short story. There were good philosophical and theological undertones. I felt that the story was too long. I think the first 50 and the last 100 pages would have made the story. There seemed to be a lot of chapters that did make certain points, but were not very relevant to the book"
3,Disappointing,"It has a lot of interesting ideas, and I would say that it's worth looking into.However:There's a hell of a lot of filler, and it's in all of the wrong places; the author tends to exhaustively detail irrelevant side-topics while only barely touching major plot devices. Worse still (to me, at least), the language is extremely dry. The characters are very bland and one-dimensional, not so much people as they are idealized Shakespearean characters that go on long soliloquies about how very beautiful caterpillars are.I'm about halfway through, and I'll finish it, but I can safely say that it's not for me."
2,Sagan's COSMOS needs a booster rocket!,"What's to like about Carl Sagan's one and only SF novel? The characters are stiff, the plot is simplistic, and the ending is unfulfilling. I find the author's contempt for organized religion disappointing. CONTACT should have been a short story --- the shorter the better!"
1,Hardly value for money,"Avoid. Great show, sadly let down by the extreme price point (for one episode? come on!) If you want some great anime on HD, grab yourself APPLESEED: EX MACHINA instead."
1,Horrible Value,"It was an okay story, and good animation, but by no means was any part of the show extraordinary, except for the price. Had I bothered to check the running time I would never have purchased it, and I desperately wish to have my money back. I simply assumed I was buying a full movie for 30$, but even a show, who is cold hearted enough to sell a SINGLE EPISODE, one and no more than one!!! I was enraged that I had passed up quality movies for this, this 25 minute episode with an incomplete story.It would not be harsh to say that because of the duration of it, and the incompleteness of the narrative, I would not pay a full 5 dollars for it, and I have been robbed of 30. There are not even any bonus features to speak of."
1,"NETFLIX, HERE I COME!","Yeah, I'm not going to buy this DVD, even though I LOVE Otomo. Granted, he didn't even direct it, he just did the character and mech designs. I'll rent it on netflix for free, see if it's actually worth it, and then wait a year or so when it's available in a DVD boxset for a cheaper price.Thanks, but no thanks..."
4,Worth the money,"These soundtracks will prove a revelation for Goldsmith fans who know him only through later scores such as Alien or the Star Trek Films. On the heels of his work with the early episodes of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Goldsmith was asked to produce music for a spy genre parody. Encouraged to not hold back, he incorporated traditional romantic orchestration with musical parody, and brought in a number of excellent jazz musicians to add a very contemporary feel to the score. The result is a cd that grows on you. It displays not only Goldsmith's craftsmanship, but a great deal of true musicianship from the performers. There are a few tracks that are better left off, and the occasional arcane recording glitch, but these are rare. From the breathtaking strings of the opening theme, to Shelly Manne's perfect percussion on track 26, this is one to get."
3,"Almost, nearly, but not quite it.","Nice thought. Great '60's scores. Produced on CD with a '90's sensibility however (action). What happened to some of the other cues from the films, especially from OUR MAN FLINT? They kind of ballanced the LP. This CD of both scores gives a little bit of a different impression entirely.Since you can probably pick up both DVDs for little more than the price of this CD, I would recommend that as the better way of getting aquainted with these wonderful pieces of spymania.And you will also get the movies themselves to boot."
2,List of Consecutive Problems,"I've had CPU cooling fan problems (it doesnot work) the unit becomes so hot you can probably prepare your Omelette on it. I spent lot of hours on call for service. Also I had DVDROM/CDRW Drive Problems, Keyboard Problems, Video Display Card Problems. I asked for unit replacement and they wont do it. They will change all the parts but they will not replace it. I would NOT recommend Sony Laptops to anyone. Their Customer Support is not at all Good .. Please do not get deceived by the looks or features or Software they offer. I would recommend IBM or Dell for Professional, Business or even Personal Use atleast you will have peace of mind and I am using IBM since last 4 Yrs and I havenot seen any problem and it never crashes .. so much for all the Money we Spend on this Unit is not Worth."
1,It won't power on just after the gurantee expires!!!,"I bought a sony PCG-GRZ630 one and a half year ago, so did one of my friends. We were attracted by its lower price, large memory and large screen ..., and so on. Half a year later I met the first problem, the integrated Lan card didn't work properly. It was automatically disconnected occasionaly for unknown reasons. One year later, just after the gurantee expires, my friend's GRZ630 failed to power on, no matter how hard we try!! Just a few days ago, I had the same problem with mine. It was terrible! Fortunately, I got it powered on again after exchanging the position of the memory sticks. Anyway, it is the worst experience with this laptop. Just a nightmare!!Suggestion: NEVER buy a sony laptop any more!!!"
1,Don't buy computer from SONY,"I bought a Sony VAIO PCG-GRZ630 at 2003. I was very happy with this machine until about a year later when it shutdown after running for 30 minutes because overheating. After finding out Sony's support/service were not helpful at all, I tuned to the Internet. After searching the web I found that not only this model, many other models of Sony VAIO laptops have the overheating problem. It actually is a hardware problem. The complaining is from all over the world, but Sony did nothing about it.I had believed SONY brand. Now, SONY is officially in my ""un-trusted brand"" list."
2,Laptop shuts down after 5 minutes of heavy load work,"This laptop has it all, my only complain centers in overheating, after 5 minutes or less of full CPU usage, like full window videos or data processing it shuts itself down due to overheating, I read similar problems with this 2.4GHZ Vaios on the net and seems like a recurrent problem. On second place here in Peru you don't get any warranty from Sony Peru (and it really sucks) now I have to take it to the states to claim for warranty, besides this BIG problem everything else on the product it's ok."
1,WORST LAPTOP,"THIS LAPTOP IS WORST ONE THAT U CAN GET IN THE MARKET. I BOUGHT THIS IN 2003 JULY AFTER 2 WEEKS ITSELF I HAD OVER HEATING PROBLEM. aFTER A YEAR THE SCREEN WENT BLIND, THEN THE HARDDRIVE, YESTERDAY AGIN THE SCRREN IS GONE. THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP. I USED TO BILEVE IN SONY NOT ANY MORE.PLEASE DONT BUY IT UNLESS YOUR THERMOSTAT IS SET TO 25 DEGREE F."
1,I can't beleive people are still buying this CRAP,"I guess this is the only way I can do some catharsis to somehow mitigate the frustration generated by the use of this laptop!I bought it in 2003 (Circuiy City), and immediatelly experienced RANDOM SHUT DOWNS. After a while the OVERHEATING problem was evident. I could hardly use the laptop. After researching on the web I found several workarounds all the way from using artic ice to taking the fan out and dusting it by blasting air through it. The latter worked for me, and I have not seen overheating for about a year. However, the BATTERY has always been WEAK (NEVER LASTS MORE THAN AN HOUR).Currently, there SEEMS to be a problem with the AC ADAPTER. With HORROR I'm reading reports from people who attribute this to a short in the actual AC plug ... therefore buying a new adapter might NOT solve the problem.Do yourself a favor DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP!!!"
1,Shoddy workmanship,"I bought a Sony Vaio about six months ago and have had nothing but problems with it. There are a lot of issues with the hardware, make sure you've looked them up. Mine would shut down randomly for no reason. Once after one of these random shut downs, I rebooted to find my hard drive completely wiped. The battery is very poor, mine lasts about 20 minutes from fully charged to low battery alarm. There's also an issue with the power circuits, sometimes the jack comes loose internally. Mine recently burned something out on the mother board that prevents me from recharging my battery.I'm sorry to say that the Vaio is the shoddiest piece of workmanship I've ever had the misfortune to come across."
1,Worst Laptop Purchase Ever,"I have had this laptop for 3 years, and have had all of the problems listed here. It overheats and crashes if I don't baby it. BOTH of the memory slots have become loose, I have to put a rubber spacer on top of the one memory card I can get to function to hold it in tight enough for the system to even boot (aside from all of the related system crashes and two weeks to figure out what the problem even was). The A/C adapter wires have broken/shorted on BOTH SIDES of the power supply. The LCD frame is slowly disintegrating to dust every time I open it, and reciently has begun to short out. And of course, Sony couldn't care less. Unfortunately, at the time I made this purchase all the reviews were good. If I had waited even 3 months I would have seen that it was a horrible choice."
3,HMMM....,"Loved this little mobile computer a LOT until the hard drive died after only 3 months. Not sure what happened, but Sony Customer Service rated 5 stars for their quick and easy replacement of the drive. Still, I lost a lot of information and work, so I am disappointed and would think twice about buying another."
5,Don't Believe the Overheating and Loudness Boloney!,"The only reason why this particular computer overheats so often is a design flaw. Without getting too techincal, air particles like dust or even pet hair can accumulate inside your laptop and prevent the heat sink from cooling off. This causes your computer to overheat. Since this is easily fixable, it should not be an issue. All you have to do is get someone to spray air into your computer through the fan hole in the back (you can even do it yourself with a can of air). Just make sure you do it outside, because I guarantee that a lot of stuff will come flying out! I am speaking from experience--I was really peeved when my computer started to overheat andthe fan was really loud and turn off randomly less than a year after I bought it, but when I got it aired out it went back to normal. So don't listen to these other people! They just didn't know that their computers were dirty!"
2,shutdown imminent,this sony vaio bought a few years ago. It's not used very much because of shutdown issues I just recently had to stick ice packs underneath and to keep swapping for cold ice packs to keep the laptop from overheating. I will never buy sony laptops again it's a real hassle.
1,I wish I could give it 0 stars,"This is one of the worst purchases I've ever made. 3 months after buying the machine, I'm also running into an overheating problem. I've sprayed out the fan with a dust blower, but the laptop is shutting down after 2 hours of use and won't reboot until it's completely cooled off.Customer support was blocked by a combination of bad instructions and a voice recognition system telling me that I was out of warranty. Trying to get a human was mostly useless until 3 days later, I accidentally stumbled on a way to get a human. (Keep telling the voice recognition system that the serial number is wrong and you will get a human.)Now they want my laptop for 7-10 business days and based on other reviews it seems the likelihood that it will be truly fixed is slim.Sony tech support denies any knowledge of an overheating problem. Please don't buy Sony until these problems are resolved."
4,Good overall laptop,"Relative to March 2003 standards, this laptop has good performance, and reliability. The only issue I've had with it is - like everyone else, apparently - after I'd had it for about a year, it started overheating and shutting down in the middle of graphics-intensive applications. It was difficult to troubleshoot, and Sony's tech support consisted of useless canned ""help"" messages.Once I realized the nature of the problem, I went to a local superstore and purchased an inexpensive Bytecc laptop cooler. (I also purchased a mac daddy 200W speaker system for it, but that's another story.) That solved the problem, and I recommend everyone get one. They're cheap, and they'll save you a lot of time, trouble, and potentially, $$. You can probably even find them on Amazon.Other than that, I've been banging away at it for about 16 hrs/day for a year now, and it's been a joy to use. I'd get one again."
1,Terrible Machine,"I have purchased the computer on February of 2003. This computer is a big disappointment.1. Just like other desktop replacement computers, it's weight is not as light as it was advertised.2. The battery life is abysmal. Even working on a Internet Explorer, the battery doesn't last more than an hour and a half.3. The fan noise of this computer is awkardly loud. I thought I must have gotten a defected item, but all products are like this. My computer was in a service (service was fast though...) but the repaired item had a same problem. It becomes almost unbearable to work because of the noise.The brand of ""Sony"" makes people buy this computer, but for the money, select one of Dell or Toshiba."
1,No more Sony for me.,"Worst laptop ever made. Paid high dollar, over heats and shuts downs in 20 minutes flats. Works well as a heat pad. Sent item to Sony, they said I needed a mother board...for over heating??. Worst customer service in the industry. NO MORE SONY PRODUCTS for me."
2,"great picture, but very expensive","This produces a great picture, but the life of the lamp is very short. We have now replaced the lamp twice. Both times, the new lamp lasted less than 400 hours. Will try one more time, than probably replace the projector."
3,Sam Spade in Outer Space,"I do agree with the previous reviewer, however, i didn't find it quite as annoying, more amusing. i mean if they can make the magnificent seven, aka seven samuri, then this is no worse. the alien culture is a bit different from maltese falcon, but down to the dead captain on the couch? at least he never called the ""lost item"" a ""dingus"". can't complain, it was a fun read, i didn't buy the book because i wanted to be intellectually challenged, i just wanted a nice scifi/detective story, in this it did serve the purpose."
5,Best of the best,"This is an amazing ball. The bounce in this thing is great. I do not have an aggressive chewer, but it does seem durable. Only warning, don't throw it hard until you get used to how well it bounces."
3,definitely not an indoor toy,"This ball could do more damage than a cue ball! It is extremely dense and heavy. Don't get me wrong, it is a durable ball that is great for bigger dogs that seem to destroy toys immediately (like mine). I'm just saying that a dog, person, or anything else could get injured badly if directly hit by this thing."
3,Strong but Heavy,"My dog destroys all chew/dog toys pretty much so it was nice to see that this ball wasn't destroyed. However, he doesn't care for it as much as the Everlasting Treat Ball. This ball has much less bounce and it is heavy. It also becomes slippery when slobbery unlike some other balls. Use it outdoors!"
5,The ONLY ball that has survived. 30 days and going strong!,First I will ssay that the photo is not the exact ball that shipped. The photo shows a hole through the ball. The one I received has no hole (I am thrilled).I have an eight month old English Bull Terrier that has managed to destroy every ball i have tried (at least 12) within a few minutes. This dog has some shark teeth and jaws of steel. I was about to give up hope until the Kong ball arrived. He has managed to get some teeth marks in it but after 30 days I am in awe. This ball has taken some insane abuse and survived. Kong is the way to go if you need a sturdy ball!
2,Not that good,I gave my dog this ball and chased him around the house with it for about 5 minutes. Then I took a break and got something to eat and came back and it was torn up and pieces of it were laying on the floor. The reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because my dog has also ripped through the tiger tested toys that Kong has so it just might be that my dog has very sharp teeth!
4,Big and sturdy,It's really bouncy and my husky seems to like it. I should of got a size smaller since it seems too big for her but she manages. I don't see this ball getting destroyed its extremely sturdy.
5,Has lasted 2 years with a Doberman Pincher,"I have a 4.5 year old 70 LBS. Doberman Pinscher that has chewed this ball for 2 years and there isn't even 1 piece missing!I even bought 1 for a friend that has 2 Boxers that have destroyed other toys.My Dobie can go through toys, bones, and other things in weeks, if not days, but not this Kong Ball.The only other toy that has survived her teeth is the Extreme Kong.They can easily be washed in the dishwasher and are tons of fun for the dog as it bounces extremely well.I've wasted tons of money on other toys that were just shredded in days but the money spent on this Kong Ball and Extreme Kong have been well worth it!"
3,It doesn't replace tennis balls,"I have a German shepherd who loves to chew for hours on tennis balls. Sometimes she gets so obsessed with her chewing that she ends up swallowing parts of that tennis ball. I got her a Kong instead, a well-made rubber ball meant to last and one that would be hard to chew apart.This is a great ball for dogs that enjoy chomping down on hard rubber. For my dog this ball is too heavy and too firm. Its weight also makes it dangerous to play fetch with, especially should this ball hit the dog in the head/snout. My dog will run after this thing but will not bring it back in her mouth.I like this ball, but my dog gives it only three stars. Perhaps I should have given her a smaller size ball. It's a great chew ball, but a heavy fetch ball."
4,kong ball,my dogs seem to destroy every toy they have and even ingest the pieces which cause issues with their guts. this seems to be very durable and I cant see them tearing this one into pieces. would like to see a smaller one made. thank you
5,I have the only dog in the world who can destroy one of these!,"I had to write because my dog actually destroyed one of these! It took her over a month, however, to get little chunks to start coming off, at which point we threw it away and got her a new one. It's the best, most durable ball I've found and she LOVES it, so I don't mind replacing it periodically. She's got other, even more durable chew toys (the black Kongs are REALLY tough!), so we're going to use this ball for playtime from now on and not let her have unsupervised, constant access to it as a chew toy. Wish Kong made this out of their black rubber, actually! Fortunately, my beautiful rescue dog restricts her chewing to her stuff, or I'm sure she could destroy my house!"
2,too heavy for a small dog,"I have a ball-obsessed smallish dog, and the vet recommended this ball as being better for her teeth. it is very heavy and she isn't at all interested in it. She still lives for the Kong squeaking tennis-like ball."
3,Baaahh...,This is just Ok...I guess I didn't know what to expect but I never use it-I use the regular kong instead. If you already have this-then don't bother with this item! It isn't the item's fault- I think I just thought it was gonna be something different to keep them occupied. DOES ANYONE know how to keep two pugs occupied other than food?????
2,Can't really rate accurately,"I gave this a 2 because it only lasted a few hours. He seemed to like it when I gave it to my 125lb German Shepherd. I played with him for a few minutes and then went inside, when I came back out it was gone. I searched my fairly small fenced in yard for a while but couldn't find it and still haven't a few months later. I think he ate it, not a good ball for large dogs."
1,kong ball destroyed,"when i bought this ball for almost $15 i thought ""great a real durable dog toy"" well after 2 weeks my dog (a 2 years old german shepherd) destroyed the ball (literally) ate it and pooped it out a day later...til this day i cant seem to find a real long lasting dog play toy."
3,Dog gone Kong ball,"My dog loves these balls. She very hard on her toys and these last her a while. When I ordered the balls they were suppose to have no holes in the middle, but they did. So connected the company and they were very nice and said they would send the correct one after they got these balls back. Ok sent them back to them, and they send the same ones back to us. I was disappointed we them. But this is a nice toy for dogs that are hard on their toys."
4,webDogTrainer.com review,Anything that gets your dog exercise and time with you is something I support! Plus this ball really works great for large dogs that may chew other kinds of balls. I have one for my own dog. For an excellent online dog training and behavioral resource check out: www.webdogtrainer.com
3,dog toy,"the kong ball i received was a solid ball- ok in itself- but was not the one with the hole- which is great for use indoors, fill it with peanut butter or dog biscuit -great. the solid ball which i received really is only good outside-as when tiger plays with it it rolls under furniture and then he tears couch, chairs, dresser drawer bottoms to shreds getting to it. definitely for use out side only. with any other dog kong toys are virtually indestructable. with tiger they last almost months."
4,"Great toy, but used?","my dog adores this toy but when I got it, the packaging on the toy was crunched and the ball had dirt marks and scuffs all over it as if it were used, kinda weird. Oh well my dog isn't picky."
5,active aussie in the NW,"My Australian Shepard loves the Kong ball, plays with it endlessly. It's great for the rainy Wa. weather, doesn't get soggy outdoors like tennis balls or other fabric type toys. When she brings it in, it's easy to clean off the mud and needles!!"
5,!,"When I first read Aztec, I was 14 years old. Almost six yearslater, I'm on my third paperback copy. Not bad considering i re-read itabout once a month! It is the absolute best book I have ever read in my life so far, and I have no doubt that it will be for the rest of my life. Aztec quite literally makes every other epic/historical, or even 1000pp+, novel I've read pale in comparison (i.e. Gone With the Wind, Heaven and Hell, Les Miserables, etc.). It's also the only one that I hope never makes it to the Big Screen, because it would be a mockery of Jennings' talent for vividly describing what that era was like so that the reader may see it in their mind. ""It would be a sullying"" of how I feel about this book. Well, I must get back to my reading..."
3,No history here...,"I don't know...it certainly isn't a book that I couldn't put down,in fact it took me several tries to finsish it. Though it started out interesting enough, you know with the sex and violence, after awhile I found myself skipping ahead to try to outguess predictable and corny outcomes. Didn't really catch any sort of mystical, magical historical viewpoint for me. More like silly soap opera dressed in Aztec rags."
3,Interesting... but how accurate is it?,"Quite an interesting book, though I was irritated for the first few hundred pages by several contradictions, such as the willingness of most people Mixtli encounters to offer their selves/daughters/cousins etc for Mixtli's pleasure despite his own tribe considering adultery and the loss of virginity before marriage a crime punishable by death.In addition I question the historical accuracy of several of the book's details. Did the ancient Aztec culture really provide sporting scholarships to their equivalent of university colleges for a game similar to basketball? Did they really describe their chief's favourite wife as the First Lady? Well researched and highly detailed fiction masquerading as fact can be a dangerous thing.But if you ignore the shortcomings and keep in mind it's pure fiction it's a very good read."
5,Erudite history meets reality-splitting yarn. A feast!,"It's hard to write a small paragraph about sucha humongous work (figuratively and literally)as ""Aztec"". The prose is polished, the historicaldetails exact (as a full-blooded Mexican, Aztechistory really strikes a chord), and the narrativenothing short of spectacular.The plot has everything: adventure, politics, sex,war, religion, philosophy, humor and grief. In the voice of Mixtli, reminiscing in his old age aboutthe things he saw and lived, we hear and learn ofthings of a by-gone and almost-forgotten world, ofrituals bizarre and common things familar. Leavingthe book is hard; leaving behind Mixtli and theOne World is even harder.The beauty of Jennings' style is that, not content with spinning an awe-inspiring yarn, carving characters you dream about later in the few hours of sleep you manage to snatch between chapters, he teaches history by vicarously making us live it."
4,Worthwhile Reading,"I thought this book to be extremely good. But I have to admit - that through the first half of the book - I was disappointed after reading all the raving reviews. It wasn't until the last half that I started liking it and then by the end - I was completely absorbed.Definitely a worthwhile read.I was transported to another time, another way of life and as a result of reading this book, I have been enriched.It is gory, graphic and for ""mature audiences"" - but I believe that is inline with life back in the 1500s; i.e., it WAS Smelly, bloody, ""less civilized"" (whatever that means) and more human.If you read it all, from beginning to end - it will be worth it."
4,The shortest long book I have ever read,"This is a rare book - a gripping page-turner with dozens of plot twists and enough action to exhaust Jerry Bruckenheimer fans, while at the same time providing a window into an ancient culture that no longer exists. Using a simple, straight-forward story-telling style, with the narrator fortunate enough to be present at all the historically significant occasions of his time, Aztec is too entertaining to allow one to be churlish. It is a great read, loaded with sex and violent images (that I still recall ten years later) and which leaves you a little sad at the end of it all. The 'uncivilized' are eradicated by the 'civilized' and by the end of this wonderful book you may be wondering at the meanings of those words."
2,Are we reading the same book?,"(...)I enjoy a good erotic novel, but this book thinks itself to be an historical book.If you love detail, pick up a book by Umberto Eco. Don't waste your money and more importantly your time in reading this junk. If you want to learn about history research it in the library. If people all over the world think our cultures were only about violence and sex, we are in serious trouble.There are many achievements and inventions not even touched in this book. (...)"
2,I only read up to page 250 but...,"I just didn't want to pick it up anymore. It just seemed like sex and violence. The first sex scene was good but after that it just seemed like the author was trying to be sensational - which I find boring. This sex stuff is interspersed with all sorts of violence and cruelty in the guise of religious ritual, accidents,etc - also boring to me. Furthermore, I felt this wasn't giving me a genuine picture of Mexico in the 16th century. When my daughter told me she was half-way through the book and was still waiting for a plot to emerge, I decided I was going to toss the book and assume that the rest of it was going to be 99% garbage like the first quarter. Why waste my time any more? I gave it 2 stars because it is well-written, that is, readably written."
1,The Forrest Gump of the Aztec World,"Ok, so I exaggerated a little in the title. The main character isn't mentally challenged like Forrest Gump. But he does have an uncanny ability to be at the right place at the right time. Did you know that he even invented eyeglasses?I am a huge fan of historical drama, and was looking forward to learning more about the Aztec world. I just couldn't get past the poor writing, which was bordering on the melodramatic. Don't even get me started on the almost laugh-out-loud bad sex scenes. One woman's vagina was referred to an an opening bud. Could the author get any more cliched?It was a true test of will power for me to finish reading this book. I would give it 1/2 star if possible."
1,I'm perplexed,"I'm honestly perplexed as to how people enjoyed this book (nothing against them, I read the reviews online before I started and was excited to read this book).As other reviewers said, it's very annoying how the narrative stops every few chapters so that the main character can talk to the Spanish. I also feel Jennigs uses these interupttions to show how much of a difference there was between Spanish and Aztec culture. Hey Jennings - NO KIDDING. He was pushing the blatently obvious every few chapters making you feel like an idiot.Another bad part was that it was hard to follow. The name of the main character changed every few paragraphs, it seemed.Secondly, the entire book had no direction whatsoever. He randomly started doing things for no reason. I wanted to read a story, no some schmuck's life story!If you haven't read historical fiction and want to kick it off with an epic, I would suggest Keith Follett's Pillars of the Earth."
1,Don't be fooled by the glowing reviews here,"I can't for the life of me understand why so many people like this book so much. It's the worst piece ... I ever finished (Stephen King's It being the worst one I didn't bother finishing). If you know ANYthing about the Aztecs, you know that most of what happens in this book is absurd and stupid. There are so many better books, don't waste your money & time on this one. Go read Stephen King's The Stand."
5,Marvelous,"Truly, Gary Jennings has a light prose, great descriptive and the book is well researched. It also treats a civilization of great importance in the history of America, and especially Mexico. I believe the best thing about this book is how through the eyes of Tilelic Mixtli, the author fully represents the full collision between two cultures with so different paradigms.The book isn't good just as history, but it is also filled with romance and adventure, without loosing it's sense of history. There is however one thing that could diminish it's greatness, and that is the tragic sense of Jennings. The whole book is filled with tragedies, and Jennings tends to do this a lot, however, in this particular case, the whole momentum of the book is tragedy.Strongly recommended, yet not for the faint of heart."
4,Historical soft porn for men.,"One thing that is as accurate in this book is the accuracy of what has been told of the beliefs of the Aztec's. However there is still quite a bit of expansion in the decriptions here. Once you get past that it seems to be structured to support soft porn for men in the endless sexual encounters of the story teller. If you take that away, and you are left with a story telller that has contradicitons in what he says and believes and then does in actually opposite ways. So you continue to read only to discover that he never gets to the point of the begining of the story that caught your interest. While he plays hard on the Spanish explorers, I have found that in many ways he was too gentle and held back much of what the Spanish have done in the past that is historical writing and is provable.I rated it a good read, tho struggling at times."
2,Too Much Sex,"This gripping novel, well researched and at times utterly facinating, is marred by an incredible number of pointless yet lengthy sex scenes that seem to take up half the book and almost never develope plot or character. A pity."
2,"A let-down, given the raves received.","The writing was uninspiring and demonstrated the author's complete obsession with sex. Graphic depictions of sex acts among characters with whom the reader does not identify did not serve to enhance the plot, but managed only to divert attention from the more appealing elements of the narrative - descriptions of the historical society of the Aztecs and the Spanish conquerers. The review of Stuart Mirsky (please read above) is accurate."
2,great if it wasnt for all the pedo stuff,"I liked it, but unfortunatly the guy seemed to love adding the fact that the main dude in the book had sex with a 7 year old boy in graphic depiction, had sex with his 13 year old sister when he was like 10. Im suprised that the pedo sex and pedo incest sex got published. didnt add a thing to the book except to be disturbing"
3,Minor errors,"How do you think inhabitants of Mexico in 1530 AD reckoned time? Certainly not by minutes and seconds - but the main character uses such increments in the narrative (e.g., third paragraph, pg. 316 of the paperback edition). Modern man, with highly accurate timepieces, reckons to the second and below, but that was not the case in 16th century Mexico. When the author injects such a modern view of time into his narrator much of the historical flavor is lost, having become questionable."
1,Note about the Inquisition,"Disfruté de este libro enormemente. Sólo una nota de advertencia (no lea lo que sigue si planea leer el libro): ningún inquisidor o autoridad eclesiástica en general habría ejecutado JAMÁS a un prisionero en el cual nada menos que el Empreador español hubiera mostrado interés. Me sorprende que Mr Jennings, tan detallista en otros aspectos, se haya plegado tan acríticamente al recurso facilista de la ""leyenda negra"".In enjoyed this book enormously. A warning note only (don't read this if you plan to read the book): no Inquisitor, no clerical authority would EVER have executed a prisoner on whom no less than the emperor had showed interest. I am disappointed that Mr Jennings, so detailed on other aspects, adheres so uncritically to the easy and unaccurate ""black legend"" Protestant cliché."
4,A Good Story Infront of A Very Interesting Background,"I liked reading this book and did not put it down till I was through to the end. It is very interesting, as the author has described the fascinating world of the Aztecs very well and with a lot of deep knowledge. I kind of felt right there among them, really living and feeling with Mixtli, the main character. However, there is a bit too much porno (not romance!) for my taste. I did love this book while I was reading it, and, because I am really interested in the pre-Columbian cultures, I went out to find similar novels about similar topics and found out that there are even better books out there - I recommend the following book to everyone who is interested in Aztecs, Incas, etc. ""The Incas"" by Daniel Peters."
5,Aztec,"This book I must say is the best book I have ever read in my life so far. This book not only is educational, but very entertaining by the way it is so well written and researched by Mr. Jennings (Which took him 12 years to write). When reading this book you really feel transported back in time of the Aztec Empire. Being of Mexican decent and born in the U.S. I only had a little understanding of my culture, but this has change after I read this book. Not only do I have a better understanding of the Mexican culture; I can now make the many connections from the Aztec culture to the Mexican culture. Please keep in mind that this book starts off slow, but once you get through the first 100 pages you will not be able to put it down. After you are done reading it you will be amaze on how rich the history of Mexico is and it is just right next door to the U.S. This book should be made into a mini-series or hopefully a major motion picture."
5,Excellent read,"I really like the Jennings books I now have and enjoy reading them over again. The stories and characters are realistic and believable, and seem based on actual events and people. I now continue my search for more of his work."
5,the best adventure novel I ever read,"I stumbled on this book in a bookstore, probably back in 1983, read it, was stunned by it and obviously started to lend it to friends and lost it......Until March of this year 1997, I never was able to find it again. I found it at Russell's, a well known Montreal second hand bookstore: the owner glancing at me: saying:that is a real find! Three weeks ago at the airport I suddenly saw it republished. I bought 5 copies to send to people whom I have been bugging about this book for the last 10 or so years....."
5,The best novel I ever read.,"I found a copy of this book (hard cover) in a communal library in the basement of the apartment building I lived in back in the mid '90s. Having just had a motorcycle accident, I was looking for a book to pass the time. Without _any_ reservation, THIS IS THE BEST NOVEL I HAVE EVER READ. I've also read his other books. They all pale in comparison to this masterpiece."
5,Worth every second of your time!!,"Do not be intimidated by the length of the book. I was, yet I read it anyway and at the end I wish there were more pages. All of the 5-star comments are true. This is one of the best books I have ever read. This is also the first review I have written on Amazon and I was so moved by the book that I had to encourage more people to read it. I highly suggest this book, you will NOT be disappointed."
4,A great story,"I read this book about five months ago.Gary Jennings transported the reader to the pre-conquest world. While I was reading I compared it with books and maps from National Geographic and found out how well documented it is.This is a refreshing view of the spanish conquest that helps to discover (to the non-latinamerican people) how the spanish conquered and enslave the new world in the name of religion and the spanish kings. What i found a little disturbing is the full charge of sexual themes all around the story, that became even boring. It is not that I'm against erotism but the line between a historical fantasy and an erotic novel vanished constantly throughout the story."
5,The crown jewel of Aztec culture,"I bought and read this book when it was first published and I was rather disappointed that it was published some years after having lived in Mexico.Mexico is a country rich in antiquities and historical sites, piramids temples and churches but dearly lacking in the details of what the society and cultures were like that built all those great wonders that have managed to withstand not only the ravages of time but also the ravages of the conquistadores.The Spanish conquerers were unable to destroy the fabulous piramids and temples of the Aztecs and only manages to cover the samller ones up in dirt and then build a church on top of the mounds.Mixtili the narrator and subject of the book manages to describe in almost lifelike detail the life and times of many of the different classes of Aztecs and their very bloodthirsty culture.5 stars do not give this book justice ....."
3,"graphic, reader's discretion advised.","I am not going to add much to all the reviews about this book.I understand that these times were particularly brutal but the way it is depicted in this novel is quite similar to showing close up pictures of mutilated bodies. You can see one by chance and don't feel good about it however the book is filled with such scenes that make its reading difficult at times. The overall historical aspect is quite interesting and the use of graphic scenes may have been a deliberate approach to transpose the reader into this world of violence and superstition.So a big warning, this book may not be for everyone and I would not advise it for a non mature audience.I don't regret having read it but will not go through it one more time. There are other novels as good without the torture."
5,Unforgettable,"This book is simply mesmerizing. One of my top 5 of all time!Like all of Jennings's blockbuster books, it grabs you and holds on. You become so enmeshed with the characters that you don't want their story to end. Jennings had the gift of making his characters human--fallible and real.His research must have been exhaustive, because when you finish this book, you feel a little disoriented in our own world--like you've actually been living in 16th Century Mexico, actually experienced Aztec life and the Spanish Conquest. You understand Aztec culture, their point of view. It's that real.Yes, as in all of Jennings's books there are gruesome scenes, and plentiful-sometimes quirky-sex, but the same is true of real life.I was just immersed in this book. Though I read it years ago, I'll never forget Mixtli and the others who inhabited his world.Excellent reading from an amazing writer!"
4,Please don't forget this is a novel,"This book gives an incredible description about the life, places, events and everything related to the people in ancient Mexico during the Spanish colonization war.A lot of details in history, arquitecture, cooking, healing etc., is given, and they look well-documented. However, I always had the question about where history finishes and fiction starts.Enjoy the book if you like this kind of reading, but, again, please do not forget this is a novel."
5,WONDERFULLY WRITTEN ACCOUNT OF THE AZTECS,"This is a book for the ages. The story, actually history of Mixtli, is written so that it is also a history of the Aztec nation. You will be captivated by the splendor of Tenochtitlan, you will be disgusted by the barbarity of their sacrifices, you will become saddened by Mixtli's heartaches, you will love this book."
5,Excellent,"This book was insightful, enjoyable, compelling, and hopefully historically accurate. Also, it was very funny. (At least the bits that involved Mixtli's conversations with the Bishop and the scribes.) Jennings did a great job in capturing the Aztec culture and its eventual downfall at the hands of the Spanish. I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading historical fiction."
5,My favorite book!,"I loved this book, a definite read if you have a good stomach. Some people will be offended by this book, especially christians. It focuses a lot on sex, murder, adventure and more. If you like a book that you will learn from you will love this book. Mr. Jennings has done so much work in researching the Aztec's that it's a history lesson without the painstakingly boring process of learning....if only every thing was this easy to learn. This is one of the few books that I wished wouldnt end. I thought that the sequel to this book ""Aztec Autumn"" wasn't as great as this one, still good but not worth the read. I am currently reading another book writen by Mr. Jennings, called Raptor, very good but Aztec is the greatest."
5,A Truly Beautiful Book,"This book captures the beauty and spirit of Colorado. Mr. Keen has a rare talent that allows him to transport us to places of extreme beauty through his artistry. An added bonus to this book is the companion cd where he shares his expertise with his readers. If you want to experience Colorado, pick up this book, sit back and enjoy."
1,Bad Choice,actually this bad choice that it does not worth a 50 Cent and I don't know how can I get 10$.
5,"Perfect Scarf for Women of Color, Hair Retains Moisture","Perfect Silk Scarf.All my life my sisters and I have worn those little satin scarves from beauty stores or discount department stores like walmart and target. But with my new hair routine I'm only using the best- the best products, best oils, and the best scarves. I knew that silk was the best I could do, so I searched the net and narrowed down my search to a scarf I found on ebay and on here. This one for its size is the best.The 30 by 30 in black for 24 dollars plus shipping is a steal. My hair retains so much moisture. I also purchased a silk pillow case (the pillowcase happened to be cheaper on ebay).What I love most about this scarf is the size- it even fits when I sleep with big rollers (after setting my hair)- it still covers my hair nicely.Great buy and I feel all women of color should have a silk scarf for their hair, it retains so much more moisture, and this scarf will last substantially longer than those little satin scarves."
4,Solid Series Rectangular Silk Scarf,"Written by recipient ;)There are other reviews which are somewhat critical of the packaging. Personally I don't care about that. The silk was of good quality and the color was even and consistent - not always the case at this price point. The only real issue was the measurements. We would have liked a wider longer version and we would have given them 5 stars. 10-12"" by 5 ft would be great. If you are small busted and petite then these will be GREAT for you, but if you have a serious bust then the simple knot will not work the ends will stick out on you."
4,Nice scarf but beware of the colors,"I ordered a Navy Blue scarf because I wanted something very dark but not entirely black. The scarf that they call ""navy blue"" is actually a ""royal blue"" - much brighter and lighter than I intended. The quality of the scarf is fine, but the color is not what I expected or thought I had ordered."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this scarf as a gift for a friend but had to return it. The photograph does not show how bad and uneven the stitching is. In addition to that the scarf had creases all over, most likely from already having been returned and repackaged. I contacted the seller but received no reply in over a week."
3,You get what you pay for,"The scarf is exactly advertised size -- which is good for a kid but too small for an adult. It is a single layer of silk and the finish is noticeably different on each side.The dye was even and the color good -- all seems were well done.I'd call this low end but fairly priced.I would not call it an ""aviator"" scarf by any stretch."
2,Solid Series Rectangular Silk Scarf - Champagne Beige,"Way too small for a scarf, cannot be used neither as a scarf nor as an ascot. The material is okay."
4,Nice Scarf,"It's very pretty, but it puckers slightly on the edges where it's stitched. However, I feel that it's a good value."
3,Adequate silk scarf,"I needed a black silk scarf quickly and this one was okay. I did not look around very long. If I had I might have looked for and maybe found one that was longer, but that was my ignorance."
3,Blue Silk Scarf,"The silk scarf was certainly as advertised; large, square and blue. The recipient really likes the feel of the silk, but I was just a bit disappointed in the packaging that it came in. I don't expect elaborate slick marketing type packaging, but a simple label, note, care instructions or something would have been nice. A blue square silk scarf in a plastic bag. That's what I got."
4,Bogus ?,"In view of one of the reviews below, I thought necessary to add a short commentary about IE studies, and thus about this book. The existence of ""one"" Proto-Indo-European may not have BEEN as such: rather than one unique language, Proto-IE was certainly a tight compound of very very close dialects. But the genetic relation existing between Celtic, Germanic, Balto-Slavic, Romance, Indo-Iranian, etc languages, and which we call ""Indo-European"" is proved and is a scientific certainty, although there is many points that are not well-clarified yet.Thus, after the publication of Mallory and Adams' book (and many others), maybe one should wait, indeed, for the publication of a SERIOUS and scholarly book proving the non-existence of a Proto-IE language or compound of dialects.For now, I am still waiting for a relevant and convincing bibliography."
1,Worst Broadway-film EVER!!,What did they do to this show? They butchered it in so many different ways I don't even know where start and I am offended that Amazon even listed this as a recommendation. TERRIBLE! Save your money. The Broadway actors are great. Rosario Dawson SUCKS!
1,Tries too hard to be good! It was boring and ridiculous!,"This movie has everything that I thought I would like! I am very diverse, I am Latino and I am gay (but straight looking and non stereotypical). So going into this movie, I was expecting something really good!! NO. It was just ridiculous. It tries too hard to be good and entertaining that it actually turns you off! This movie is more like some diverse party overnight with them filming themselves singing and talking about their problems. I can't believe people actually like this! Inclusion of diverse characters doesn't mean that it is automatically a hit. There has to be a character development that you can feel...it was just not in this movie!"
2,See it in New York (or on tour again...hint hint),Way too much money was put into the movie. The cast is way too old. It completely lost all of the grittiness and the pain of the play. It's very unfortunate that there was an opportunity to immortalize one of the great landmarks of the contemporary musical theatre and this is all we ended up with.
3,Where's the unrated director's cut?,"Many of us ""Rent"" fans have complained about the missing songs, However they were cut and are not missing. I want the edition with these songs restored to there former glory and correct position from the play. Don't get me wrong, I love that they made the movie at all but I wanted to see the play kept intact.The movie never really gave me the chills that the play did. I also feel that they skimped on the extras, Rent has such an interesting history that was not shared."
2,It Made me Miss the Play,"The movie started off well with the staging of Seasons of Love, but then went downhill. Situations that you accepted on stage and characters you loved did not work in a more realistic setting. The age of the actors made a difference too. I left the movie theater thinking: ""Wow, these are selfish people!"" They kill dogs, whine about getting jobs and paying rent, and are drug addicts. In the play you are transported to their world and love and accept them, but I truly disliked them in the movie. However, the songs sounded great and I enjoy the cd a lot!"
1,Terrible,"This movie is simply terrible. It's not like I'm homophobic or anything, I'm actually gay, but this movie just promotes stereotypes and I resent the favorable dipiction of the immature, immoral, and idiotic ""la vie boheme."" On top of all that, from a stylistic point of view, the plot was just absurd, the characters were intensely unlikeable and unsympathetic (I absolutely DETESTED every single one of them, Angel especially), the songs' melodies were grating, and the lyrics were just plain stupid. People in the theater actually laughed at parts that were supposed to be serious because the movie was that aweful. In short, avoid at all costs."
3,Lost in translation,"Somehow, I think something must've been lost in adapting this from stage to screen...the story is not bad, many of the songs are great, but somehow the whole thing is a bit listless, clunky even in parts...Parts of it, too, are just too sappy, too well intentioned...I haven't seen the stage version - maybe it contains the elements that are missing from this well-meaning, but failed filmed attempt at it."
3,WISH IT WERE BETTER,"I loved the musical RENT - it caught you off-guard, and its characters inhabited their world with a gritty urban quality that is all but lost in the film version. While the score is transferred nicely - the richest songs intact and sung expertly by the entire cast, including newcomer Rosario Dawson - the setting and staging of the story seems at times completely out of whack. It all looks way too pretty for the lower East Side of the late '80s. It is truly a ""fantasy world"", and once you decide to accept it on its own terms, you will have a good time. But so much of the urgency in this story is now dated, and though the players give it their best, it seems an almost wildly overblown treatment of a rather simple musical."
3,Very Long but Enjoyable,"I liked RENT, But then again I only saw it once, except when I watch the beginning when they sing Seasons of change. Angel was so cute, you know the guy who played angel anyways. But in all it was a great movie that made me cry a whole lot."
2,Skips,The movie it self is amazing!!!! But I was dissapointed that the disc skips about 30 mins of the movie. From the take me for what I am song all the way to Angel's furneal. Get this movie from another company!!!
2,Not Necessary as a Blu-Ray,"I'm not sure what classifies a Blu-Ray disc rather than a DVD disc but this movie is lacking in HD quality. I would not recommend buying it on Blu-Ray, save money and by the DVD instead."
3,Relative resonance,"Had been familiar with 'Rent' from original stage reviews but otherwise no vested interest or pre-existent motivation before renting the DVD. The talents of the performers are apparent and the drama resonates inequivocally. But for the life of me am unable to recall any of the songs except for their context. But for the musical numbers, otherwise well staged, would have awarded 'Rent' four stars."
5,No Day But Today,"I have never seen the play or even listened to the broadway score before I went and saw this movie. I don't know what it is that draws me to this movie, but theres a power there that I cannot escape. I don't know if it's the memorable characters, the songs or their lifestyle that I identify with, but Im in complete awe everytime I listen to the soundtrack or watch the movie. I saw this movie twice in the theater and I can't wait for the DVD to come out to watch the documentary of Jonathan Larson. I also own the broadway album which I love since I've seen the film. My goal is to see the broadway show when they come down to my neck of the woods!"
2,So disappointed,"I'm a renthead and in my opinion, the movie really didn't do the musical justice. =("
5,No day but today,"Rent is really an increbidle concept. The plot of the movie is both simple and complex at the same time, which is the point of the movie. Having seen the show on Broadway, I was really excited for the movie to come out. Since Larson's family worked on the movie along with many original cast members, they stayed true to the messasge of Larson's original play.This movie is not for everyone, though. Not everyone can relate to homosexuality or being a struggling artist in NYC. However, there is one message throughout the movie that is for anyone who has loved in their life: that no matter what you do, you will always feel the pain along with love.A very touching film, I suggest that you buy it. If you have only seen the play, don't expect it to be a Broadway show. If you've seen the movie, I suggest you buy it and then go see it on Broadway."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A perfect example of a play that needs a live audience, Rent simply doesn't work as a film: characters and scenes that worked on Broadway fall painfully flat on celluloid."
3,Will Hollywood ever get it right?,"I'm a theater kid, and a HUGE RENT fan. Like any theatre kid knows, RENT is like... ""the show"". You know every word to every song, every move in ""La Vie Boheme""...... but the movie, which was strongly inticipated....... just fell short. It wasn't good enough for RENT. what i did enjoy was that it made the people real. They were in a real subway, a real cafe, a real apartment, but thats just about it. Im glad the kept the original broadway cast, that was very wise, but sorry Mr. Collumbus, it just fell short.Will hollywood ever be able to adapt a current broadway musical to the big screen, and do it well?the only one that worked was Chicago. RENT and Phantom just arent doing it for me."
1,Just didn't do it for me!,I loved the music but couldnt really follow the story. Too many characters and too many stories going on at once. I actually had to read on Wickepedia that most of the characters had aids! Yeah just didnt do it for me on any level.
5,Absolutely Awesome !!!!!,"My daughter and friends convinced me to purchase this movie and I was absolutely blown away!!! It is a ""MUST BUY"" on my list and can't wait to get the soundtrack -"
4,Fabulous,"I thought this movie was great. It truly expressed in so many ways the true meaning of friendship and the struggles they went through. No matter what lied between them, they all stayed friends. An inspirational movie especially for teenagers to see. I recommend it to everyone."
5,The Best Musical I have ever seen,"I heard of RENT about 4 years ago, but never got the chance to see it. I have visited NEW York plenty of times but never got around to it. Since I live in a place where about 2% of the population, my only option was to get the movie. Everything is great about it. I loved it. The movie is heartfelt without a doubt. It sends a powerful message to the rest of the world about AIDS/HIV. I am trying to get others to see it but I live in a reddneck town. RENT won't even think about coming to Tallahassee. Season of Love has to be one of the best in my opinion. I did not like ""One Song"" though. Everything else was great. I read about people comparing the movie to the play. However, amazon and the rest of the U.S. needs to know that some of us do not have the opportunity to see the musical. Perfect Cast hands downs. A MUST SEE. Even if you don't like musicals watch the first 5 mins of it. that drag queen is awesome on those with the drumsticks."
3,"Here's to ""moo.""","That's what performance artist Maureen tries to get her audience to say in her one-woman show protesting her landlord. But it describes the music, too - much of it comprises overblown show-rock that sounds like it came from The Lost Meat Loaf Tapes. ""Moo,"" indeed.The movie is set in 1989-90 but only one character, the hapless Bon Jovi wannabe Roger, actually takes on the thankless task of looking like he was from that era - everyone else appears up-to-date.On the plus side, there's a nice, comfy vibe between the actors. It's not as self-consciously big-budget/star-power as ""Chicago,"" but neither is it as clever or catchy. If you're not interested in an adrenaline rush, ""Rent"" is the movie-musical for you - conflict is minimal. Unfortunately, this means that the movie drags, and surprises are rare."
1,I Don't Get The Hype...,"Personally, I didn't understand the film or the musical. The message I understand, but the singing, dancing, music, and plot in general didn't really move me, convince me, or uplift me. I understand that in even the most depressing themes in a musical, the music still remains exuberant and positive. But something about the music in RENT didn't seem to fit. I found them to be lackluster and not catchy at all. The characters were bland and boring to me. Not much personality, felt more like watching sterotypes on screen with no depth, emotion, or feeling. One of the actresses who played a lesbian was truly the most horrible and over the top actor I've ever seen, just ridiculous and annoying. I'm glad i watched this with a few co-eds than by myself, it made it a tiny bit more enjoyable. Personally though, i hate the movie, and i just don't understand the musical. Great themes, but just so dry, lackluster, and at times just a bit unrealistic and boring."
1,Rent DVD,"Hi there,I have yet to receive the Rent DVD that I paid for. The last shipping date was noted April 21st, please advise.I have ordered from Amazon.com before but this is the first time I have not received what I purchased and I don't know how to go about dealing with this. Thank you."
1,horrific like watching a train wreck,"By far the worst MOVIE ever. Horrific, terribly long and boring. Worst movie I've ever seen, literally."
1,CINEMATOGRAPHY .....?,The movie version is dreadful and very very dated ~ some of the stars [male] resemble Ken dolls in their perfection - Idina Menzel - brilliant performer should sue - terrible cinematography - initially.Try Baz Luhrman's 'Boheme' - much better!!!
1,RENT? I'M ON STRIKE!,"I am still on a Rent strike: Director Chris Columbus' cinematic take on Jonathan Larson's tale of friends and lovers, junkies and transsexuals, battling AIDS, poverty and other assorted maladies of the this thing called Life remains overblown, overwrought and overdone. On the big screen, ""lame"" also comes into play. Many of the original Broadway cast members are reunited for this gritty, noisy excursion into an underbelly that has gone belly up."
1,Worst film of all time!,"Sickening. Appallingly bad. Inept in every way. Horrible acting, singing, direction, photography, music. Stupid plot (a musical about AIDS!???).The worst film of all time.Why not a musical about starvation, or about torture, or about Anthrax?This film and the stage musical are insults to the intelligence.And those who marked this review as not helpful don't know what 'helpful' means."
4,Love the music,"I have never seen the play (the only way I get to see any brodway play is if it goes to movie) and when I saw this at the movies at first I was put off by the theme of the lifestyle,etc. Not my cup of tea..a full movie about free sex (do not care if they are same sex or not tho) and drugs. BUT....what stuck with me was the friendship and how they connected to each other and the songs. So I bought the dvd, saw watched the movie again, and like it better the 2nd time around. This time knowing the story, I just did not 'see' the drugs and sex (well you never see the sex to that is not a problem) but got really into the friendships and how they all connected, stronger , this time. So it is now one of my fav dvd's."
2,A schmaltzy exploitation of late 80s NY,"The actors do a more-or-less good job and appear quite dedicated to the project. Most of them sing pretty well with a notable exception of the headliners Diggs and Dawson - they're painful and I wished they just lipsynced to someone with a voice.The movie, however, left me cold. What bugged me most is the Hollywood schmaltz laid thick all over what is purpotedly the late 80s' NY. What was a gritty, sick, and extremely creative scene has been transformed out into cutesy entertainment. In this Starbucks version of late 80s East Village, junkies and AIDS sufferers feature cool clothes, perfect bodies, clear skin, and neat haircuts. Their suffering is largely outside the camera shot. Not only the whole farce felt cheap, it seemed to cheapen the experience of those who lived, died, and created on that scene."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"I SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST WAS IN THE THEATRES AND I HAVE TO SAY I WAS DISAPPOINTED. IT WAS A LITTLE DEPRESSING FOR MY TASTE. WHEN IT WAS RELEASED ON DVD I ORDERED THE 2 DISC SET. I WATCHED THE MOVIE AGAIN AND TO MY AMAZEMENT, I LOVED IT. THERE A LOT OF THINGS I MISSED THE FIRST TIME AROUND. SO WHAT IF THE ORIGINAL ACTORS ARE OLDER THAN WHEN THEY WERE ON BROADWAY. AT LEAST THIS MUSICAL HAD ALL BUT 2 ORIGINAL CAST MEMBERS AND IT SHOWED THEIR CAMRADERIE AND THEY INVITED US TO HAVE A GOOD TIME WITH THEM. I REALIZED THIS WAS A CELEBRATION OF LIFE. THIS IS A UNIVERSAL THEME NO MATTER WHETHER IT'S THE 80'S OR 2006/07. THE DOCUMENTARY ON THE COMPOSER AND PLAYWRIGHT WAS TOP NOTCH AND YOU REALIZE WHY HE LABORED SO HARD ON THIS MUSICAL. IT'S JUST SO SAD THAT HE NEVER GOT TO SEE HIS DREAM OPEN ON BROADWAY. I BELIEVE FOR THE ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE, IT WAS A LABOR OF LOVE FOR HIM. I'VE WATCHED IT 5 TIMES AND I'M STILL NOT SICK OF IT."
5,Unforgettable,"This is the first time a movie has done a Broadway play justice. The characters are both larger then life yet still very real, the singing passionate and the story is unforgettable. I have recommended this title to many of my friends."
4,How are we going to pay the RENT,"Seeing Rent on Broadway five times I was more than apprehensive about the transition-stage to screen....I found it better than I imagined and I wanted to add that after speaking with numerous people who only saw the movie,that they truly enjoyed the production of the motion picture and they had no point of reference at all to the show....I believe that RENT was so much better than I anticipated. The show unfortunately is becoming less effectiveand somewhat dated as we continue into the 2000's"
5,Simply Awesome!,One of the best movies [musicals] ever made!!! I received it today and am watching it for the 5th time. What a shame that it did not receive the attention it deserved with respect to the movie awards. I've already got the soundtrack which is equally amazing. A definite must for musical lovers
5,Excellent!,"I absolutly loved this movie. When i saw previews for it on television, i thought it would be a different sort of movie, since they showed dancing and singing. I had no idea it was a musical on Broadway until i did some research online before going to see it.Ok, on to the movie. I loved it, as i already said. It was both fun, and sad at time. i dont want to spoil it for anyone who has yet to see it(what are you waiting for!) I was very suprised to hear it got mixed reviews. But then, alot of movies lately are gettign mixed reviews, no matter how good they are.The songs were great, i especially liked ""La Vie Boheime"" and ""Out Tonight"". Right after seeing it, i went out and got the soundtrack. :-)You must see this, whether you've seen the play or not!"
5,Amazing. Just absolutely amazing.,"I've been a Rent fan for a while now. The moment I heard they were making Rent a movie, I was estatic because I've never had the chance (or money) to go see it on broadway.When I first bought the movie soundtrack, I was a little scared. Even though most of the lyrics were the same, there were more drums, more guitars and the music seemed so powerful I was afraid it would take away from the plot and theme of the movie. I refused to listen to the movie soundtrack for a while.But when I saw the movie, the soundtrack made sense. The more modern music fit in perfectly with the vivid colors and strong emotions that could be seen in the movie.The original broadway *is* better than the movie (the original almost always is better than the new version). But Rent made an amazing transition from the stage to the big screen."
5,An outstanding piece!,"Very good acting, remarkable music, heart-wrenching story. ""This is the film version of the Pulitzer and Tony Award winning musical about Bohemians in the East Village of New York City struggling with life, love and AIDS, and the impacts they have on America""([...]). Very good production, whose shortcomings you will probably miss, as you will be so taken by the story and the human drama. You should also look up Jonathan Larson, the composer and playwright, who received 3 posthumous awards for RENT!"
4,Pretty good!,"Pretty good movie. My friend who saw the musical said it wasn't as good, but it still wasn't bad. The production value is high and it has a good message at the end."
5,One of the greatest movies of all time!!!,"This movie was sooooooooooo good and I would make the star count even higher if it went pat five. Buy this movie or at least rent it. If you haven't seen it yet, this movie will change your life"
1,mediocre pop music and a horrible message,"I will start off by saying that I am a huge fan of musicals, including modern rock musicals, but I hate ""Rent"" (including the original play). Trying to persuade me with desperate fan comments will be a waste of your time. The characters are not likable; they are one dimensional, frivolous, and self-centered. Also the entire reason we are supposed to feel bad for them is because they have aids. Aids is a serious illness that shouldn't be made light of as it is in this horrible production. If you want to see a good play/movie about aids awareness, go see ""Angels in America"" instead. Furthermore the story line is slow moving and (obviously because of the weak characters) boring. However, if you've never met a gay person or a stripper before and you think that aids is trendy and fun, this is the movie for you."
3,Great music...but...,"This movie has got some really really good music that I could listen to all night long...that is for sure, but here is my problem with this movie...at times it can seem a bit drawn out...and the biggest problem that I have is the rating (PG13). Again, as I have said before...what is with the ratings board on this one...this is not something that I would allow anyone under 16 to watch...profane, overly sexual...I am not homophobic in anyway, but I do not see the need to have homosexuality, transgendered people jammed down the throats of our young people...these kids have enough to worry about, let alone be overrun by such material. The acting was great, and again, great music, excellent storyline...but beware parents, this is not something that you may want your child to watch anytime soon. Kids are growing up WAY TO FAST...and we wonder where they get it from???!!!"
1,Love. For Sale.,"Really? This is why I shun nearly all musicals anymore. Sing what needs to be sung; speak what needs to be said. And this might have been more enjoyable... just maybe - if that had been the case. The songs were just awful to begin with. The forced rhymes and lyrical stupidity. The checklist of one of each type of expected broadway song. The bad bad acting. Idina Menzel baffles me. She is truly frightening to look at, like a shark in leather pants, and her voice's nearest approximation would be a cat strangling itself. The whole story is as thin as onion skin and not one of the actor's invests any energy into their character - the exception would be Angel. And not one of them made me care one iota. Bleh."
2,"""Rent"" is Deeply Bent","Although this musical makes some good points about life, liberty, etc., the overall effect rather lacks in luster. Try as I might, I simply couldn't see the so-called ""Bohemian spirit"". Most of the song lyrics are flighty, and the characters perplexing. The plot is weak and difficult to follow - there's a strangeness about the whole thing. Something key is missing; there's nothing to tie it all together. Plus, it's pointlessly, erratically depressing in parts. I would strongly suggest one forget to rent ""Rent""."
1,It Stinks,"I've never seen the play and have never even heard of it before. I did see the preview for it and thought that the opening music was uplifting and held high hopes for this movie, at least enough to rent it.After seeing it, I should have just stuck with my visions of it from the preview, because that was the only good part of this film.I've seen film adaptations of musicals fall short (except for Grease) and would be willing to go to the play to see if it was any better. But, if it is even remotely like the film, I will probably feel the same way."
4,A Rock Opera for all tastes,"The music ranges from true rock 'n roll songs to excellent Broadway musical numbers. So if you're not enjoying what they're singing at any given moment, just wait a bit and the tempo/mood will change soon enough. Best scenes: 'Light My Candle' and 'Tango Maureen'. The cast is perfect - most are from the Broadway production. New to the cast is Rosario Dawson, who may just be the most enticing East Village denizen you'll ever encounter. A bit slow at times, but a nice visual balance between gentrified NYC and the real nitty gritty of the bohemian scene."
5,Don't listen to him!!,"If you're a true fan of musicals, there is no possible way to hate this movie. It is great. So what if it doesn't make sense to someone? The music is very catchy and I never get bored of it. I think it was a very good movie and there's no reason why you shouldn't purchase it. End of story!"
2,There is only No here.,"AIDS and homosexuality in the modern city of New York:pretty much reminds of the biblical Sodom and Gomorrah?Love there may be, but this is the way of death.That they are dying of AIDS / HIV virus passed on by blood in injectionsof illegal drugs and sexual contact pretty much tells them they have made a wrong turn?To write a musical rejoicing in that choiceis just worst than sad, and stupid ,it is probably criminal.That beauty came out of this tragedy is amazing.Do I feel sorry for these people; should I feel sorry for them?I do , but I probably shouldn't.This movie is about the worse social decay since ancient timesand it probably helped to further spread AIDS in New York."
1,SOILED THE NAME OF RENT FOREVER,"I went to new york for a drama field trip with my high school last year. Ofcourse, when you have a bunch of drama geeks in new york, the first thing you do is buy broadway tickets. For us, they were RENT tickets. Even with a couple of guys that flinched at the thought of a musical, every single one of us fell in love with the show. Naturally, when the movie came out, we all rushed to a theatre to see it. And i have to say. . .THE MOVIE IS HORRIBLE. Was the director on crack while he shot this? The movie completely ruins the magic of the show we saw on broadway. Do yourself a favor, don't watch it. Everyone of us who saw the broadway show hates this movie."
2,"LEASE, the movie","Everytime I see a commercial for RENT, I get the song ""Everybody Has AIDS"" from the RENT spoof in TEAM AMERICA stuck in my head. Anybody else?"
1,RAVE ON AIDS!,"The movie Rent is definitely a movie to see if your an adult. Its' mature theme limits the wide audience. It was well done from the stand point of having the original cast, 6 months pre-production, boldness, electricifying performances, and punts. On the other hand, the movie lacked a sense of wholeness. Almost like following through a music video without any script. Even when script was added to it, they used punts, funny but not necessary. This is a serious theme of AIDS and 1990's. I didn't even know that ATZ is a AIDS mediaction, until I thought about it. It was sort of vague, although, I did watch a film about aids and their incapable of paying rent. The end of the movie, made you wanted more... to complete the movie's message to take like everyday as today, not tomorrow. I think this rave on aids is more suited on broadway, not films."
1,worst movie I have ever seen,"Boring, didn't care for the theme at all, basically crappy music, a failure in every aspect. I can't believe anyone could have the nerve to give this a five star rating. Sheesh."
1,Should be retitled TRASH,"It's about a group of ultra-libral, ultra-gay, ultra-poverty, useless, low-lifes who hate everything that doesn't originate from the gutter and believe if everyone just sat around singing Kum-bay-ya and stuck needles in their arms while they have public homosexual sex the world would be a better place........oh, and it's all set to music!2 1/2 hours of depressing trash....by the end of the movie I was hoping they all would jump off the building that they lived in and never pay RENT !"
2,Opera goer?,"I like operas, voice, stage design arts, orchestra, and custom... I watched it because it suppose to be the modern version of La Boheme. The film was okay, I'll say just about average, but it's not something that I'm going to watch again. If you like ""traditional"" style opeara, you won't like it much. Those of you who liked this film, go watch Franco Zeffirelli's La Boheme, you'll change your mind."
5,Excellent,"I can't say enough about this film. I loved the play, too. Buy the DVD so you can enjoy the story any time you want!"
3,Stage version is better,"I bought the DVD after falling in love with Rent on stage in Sydney. The songs, the characters, the story - it's such a great production. The movie lived up to my expectations, but it didn't live up to the thetre performance. I recently saw the show again in Dublin, and again, it was great. When I return to Sydney I'm looking forward to watching the movie, cos while it's not as good as stage versions tend to be, I can watch it when I want, and in my loungeroom ... and for a fraction of the cost of a live show."
1,Don't waste your time,I have seen Rent live on stage a number of times. If you haven't then you probably won't understand what this is actually about. The film version does not show the audience the pure passion that the stage version shows. I was very disappointed.
1,AIDS awareness deserves a better musical,"I'm a sucker for musicals, I just love it when the characters sing their hearts out about their joys or troubles.But I couldn't stand this musical. I didn't see the show, but from the movie, I'd have no desire to. All but two of the characters are entirely incredibly self-centered, but we're meant to pity them and their tragic plight? Did I miss something? Why do they think (as they sing in the opening number) that they should be exempt from paying rent like the rest of the world? Why does the heroine think its acceptable for her to cheat on her loving, supportive life-partner at their commitment ceremony? Some of the songs are catchy-ish, but the overall attitude of the characters grated through the whole thing. Yuck. AIDS awareness deserves a better musical."
5,Great Movie,"The producted was packaged well, was exactly what I wanted, received what I order and it was in great shaped when received...."
5,AWESOME MOVIE...,"I am not much the musical soundtrack kinda guy but I have to tell you I was BLOWN AWAY at the Picture Quality & Sound (Blu-Ray). The songs are really catchy and they grow on you the more you listen/hear them! I highly recommend this movie, the story line is very today as well!"
4,It lighted my candle,"I never seen it on Broadway, but after watching the movie, I will. Thanks for the original cast. I loved it. I also purchased the CD (The Broadway version) and it's in my car CD Player ever since."
5,RENT changes the thoughts of most,"RENT the movie is kind of like a documentary. It tells about peoples lives and their thoughts. If you went into the theater having no idea of what the story plot was, you'd walk out being able to react the whole movie. RENT is a story of people; people that are just like all the rest of us, but they live off of each others souls."
3,Good but so much less than it could have been,"I loved Rent when I saw it on stage, and I could probably play the original cast recording back in my head start to finish without prompting. So I was really looking forward to the movie. Immagine my disappointment when I actually saw what came out. A lot of the music had been left out, with musical dialogue turned in to spoken dialogue, seemingly at random. I bought the DVD because half a Rent is better than no Rent at all, but it could have been so much more. I had the same reaction to Phantom of the Opera. As a fan of the play, I think it would have been better if they had simply set a video camera in the third row of the orchestra and taped a performance right off the stage. All the extra production that went into the movie took away from the play and didn't add anything."
5,Why people hating the Movie,"When I first walked into the movie theartre this movie blew me away. Its mix or rock, ballads and over all fun make this a must for a fan of the play or of musicals. This, however, is where people get the wrong idea. Fans of the play have said that it just dosen't live up. I find that, while this is true, the movies good. + most orginal actors who don't suck. Get it, Love it. I bilieve that this should come with a warning though. This movie touches isues about Homosexualness, drugs, and poverty. It just isn't for everyone. LA VIE BOHEME"
4,all the years round,"dumped this to reel to reel to 8 track much better listening 30 years out , it was good then too, i like all the years round, this is important in a) they did it, and b)it is so avante gardethat you have to listen and appreciate it, no hype is professed or required, true musicians and talent in their own way, its extremely hard to find their stuff, i will help anyone who wants to get a copy ok?"
3,good but not great,"Well I was very excited about this book when I first ordered it and I was really looking forward to reading it. Well It was a good book but I didn't think it lived up to the recommendations it has had. It was a bit slow throughout the book. I liked the fact that the Heor Malcolm MacFane aka the Black Wolf is not super strong but has had major injuries to overcome. I actually liked him and his friend Gavin much better than the heroine in the book, Ariella. At first I thought she would be a wonderful heroine, strong and willful but loyal and caring to her clam and to the injured Black Wolf whom she was to have been married to. Even though she helps ease his physical pain she doesn't seem to interested in helping him heal his emotional pain. She seems very cold to me. The other characters in the book make it very funny at times. The training scenes and the two old men are very humorous. All in all I would say its a good read but it could have been so much better."
3,This had potential...but didnt live up to it.....,"I liked this book, but was expecting better. For one thing, I found it irritating that Ariella's identity was kept from Malcolm for so long...not until after over 100 pages did he find her out...also, while I really admired Malcolm for overcoming his hardships, I found Ariella to be rather bratty.The writing was peppered with humor that I found charming, but the characters lacked that spark that I love to watch burn between 2 people with undeniable chemistry. I wouldn't dissuade one from reading this, but I wouldnt recommend it either."
3,?? the chicken or the egg,"This book is so similar to Dodd's ""Once a Knight"" that at first I thought that I had already read it! I think that the Dodd book probably came first because it has a sequel ""A Knight to Remember"". All three books are entertaining and you come to love the heroes and admire the heroines."
4,Tink,"This was the first book I read of this author and I was a little worried when I picked this book up due to the other reviews. However, I really enjoyed this book. As you read the book your heart goes out to the hero, Malcolm and Ariella. If you are looking for an enjoyable read, this is for you."
1,A Major Dissapointment,I have read every single book by Karyn Monk and I have loved all of them except this one. I didn't even finish the book it was so bad. The heroine was annoying and condescending towards the hero and the hero eas just a washed-up has been. The characters just did not work for me. What happened to the magic she so aptly displayed in all of her other books? Well I guess every author writes at least one unsatisfactory book or two.
2,Disappointing CD,"I heard this CD being reviewed on NPR's All Things Considered and really liked the snippets they played. However, most of the music on this CD is not Yo-Yo Ma's best work. It was a spur of the moment purchase that I now regret."
2,Very disappointing,"After reading reviews, I could hardly wait to get this cd. It finally came today and to be frank, it's quite bland and boring. Not one of his better cd's"
2,Oops ! Yo-yo ma with depression ????,"I am a big fan of Yo-yo Ma, but this CD is a tearjerker and afterwhile, I have to switch it off because it was so boring. I have all his other CD's and I wish it wasnt so... I highly recommend his baroque CD's though."
2,Not sure what to say,"Unfortunately, while I received confirmation from amazon that this had shipped, and was charged for the item, I never received it. I can't find a phone number, and my efforts to secure it via amazon's ""where's my order"" service and UPS tracking, were so time-consuming and tedious that I gave up in order not to spend hours at work on the tasks. I would like to resolve the issue, and receive another CD that shipped with this one, and it finally occurred to me that this review might help."
2,"Great Artist, Poor Recording","Horrible, horrible recording. Yo Yo Ma, as usual, gives a great performance. The sound engineer, Richard King, should be run out of his profession. The recording is muddled, piano and other instruments are too loud, and even the sound of the cello is occasionally distorted. You can hear Ma breathing and other distracting sounds during the course of certain songs."
5,"Deep, Serious and diverse","Yo Yo Ma is simply fantastic, and has arrived as such a height of recognition that any production he is invovled in will be top of the line, as this is.This is a darker collection than I expected. And like a serious, reserved friend, it can take a little longer to appreciate than the bubbly outgoing ones. I now find I like it very much, but it is serious ""conversation.""There is great variety here as well, and I gave it to a friend's teenager who is considering whether she wants to learn the cello. Her response was much the same as mine. Initially not so sure, but over time, has really come to like it, too. This collection has great depth."
5,Passionate recording,A wonderful recording of very moving music. A present for my wife who is moved by Yo Yo's music.
5,Well pleased,I was extremely impressed by his music and I perticularly love #4 & # 7. I am relaxed when I listen to Yo-Yo Mas music and it really is quite intense and strong. I Love it.
4,"Dense, but still the classic","When I first tried to work through Goodwin's Grammar in learning ancient Greek, I was astounded at the sheer impenetrability of his system. It took me at least two weeks to find the verb ""to be""! But once you get the hang of it, there's nothing like it for systematicity, thoroughness, and detail. Next to the LSJ lexicon, it's the most important volume for any student of classical Greek."
5,The Way of Tai Chi Ch'uan,"This video is enjoyable and easy to use &#65533; the instructions are clear, the history and philosophy of Tai Chi are well presented, the movements are well filmed using different angles, and the music is appropriate &#65533; it is so peaceful that I entered a state of great serenity while watching.This is a wonderfully constructed instructional video on Tai Chi. Lana Spraker exudes health and inner peace. The practice of Tai Chi clearly works for her!I recommend it highly!"
3,It's all in the moves,"If you do Tai Chi for health especially you want to be relaxed and in a pleasant state of mind. The music is nice, the production values okay, the moves accurate. The presenter didn't seem at all comfortable in her moves. OTher than that it is a very inforamtive tape and great for beginners who wish to learn the form on their own."
5,wonderful bags,"Just recieved my grocery bags and I am very very pleased. They have lots of room and are really well made. I no longer have to use plastic that rips and you have to recycle,(for ever). I like the fact too that the bottoms are flat so nothing falls over. They are more then worth the price."
5,Excellent Bags!,"These are excellent bags; they hold a ton of groceries, wash well, and roll up pretty small so they are easy to carry around in the car. I am planning to buy more to give as gifts."
5,Very pleased,I recently received these bags. Great product at a great price...I hope they become available once again.
1,Don't believe the picture,"The tote you receive is extremely flimsy, cheap cotton. It couldn't stand on its own if it was filled with cabbages. I was hoping at this price for something I could use for groceries for years. I'm cutting off the handles and using it to wash my car."
2,I was expecting for a better product from Belkin,"I paid no too much for this product but their capabilities were not enough for me because: having a power load about 35% I just have around 6 mins backup time and no 120min full-load as offered; has no external mute botton and every time you need to turn this sound off you must to connect the PC to do it thru the SW; it has no internal voltage regulator (just can define low/high limits where the battery will start to work); the WinXP SW sometimes doesn't work and for this you couldn't monitor&control the device, to do it you will need to restart the computer; you have no protected power outleet included and this make you to add an extra outleet to your wall if you need to feed no protected devices. Is not the best product for 1500VA, but for this prices is the only want you could find!!"
1,UPS Over Temperature!,"I bought the F6C1500-TW-RK in Feb. 2006.It lasted 13 months (till Mar. 2007), then it said ""UPS Over Temperature!"". Power cycling it didn't work.Stay away from Belkin!"
2,Does not last long,"Pros: Nice friendly installation, software is much better than the one provided with APC UPS's, convenient form-factor.Cons: battery lives less than 10 mins with my setup. My other UPS (APC 1500VA) holds a higher load for 30 mins. Since it is a main parameter of a UPS I'd give this product only two stars."
2,"Works, but no mute button, others offer more features for about the same price","I've had this UPS for about 13 months. It works well enough for short blackouts, the box is relatively compact and looks nice enough.The biggest problem I have with this unit is that it has no mute button. A lot of cheaper UPSes lack the mute button, and when the power goes out at my house, I have beeping all over the place.You might argue that the Belkin software can mute the UPS (not sure if it really does or not), but the software SUCKS badly on both Windows XP and Mac OS X. It's absolutely horrible. I can tell you that the UPS software DOES properly shutdown my G5 tower quickly when the power goes out (haven't tried it with my XP machine).For only a little more APC offers a 1500 VA unit with a voltage meter on it and a physical mute button. I'm slowly migrating over to these higher end APC units for the meter and the mute button."
3,All But 7,"I have a F6C1500-TW-RK, and, the best I can tell, there is no Windows 7 (64-bit) support for the Belkin Bulldog Plus Monitor that is essential to the full operation of this device.Their website shows no 64-bit support. Looks like I'll have to replace it, dump the F6C1500 on Craig's List, and regroup. Sigh.Updated June 2010: Belkin advises that they are going out of the UPS business and will no longer support this product with operating system updates. Too bad. This was an outstanding UPS."
3,Lasted a bit less than expected,"Overall worked fine but unexpectedly died just after 3 years of service. I am not talking about the battery - the whole unit is just not powering back up regardless... I expected a bit longer service, which was my experience with APC UPS..."
1,Don't buy Belkin UPS!!!,"This is my second Belkin that went belly up within a year and a half. This unit was only a year old. It let off a continuous tone with red light. I would have thought maybe the batteries needed replacing but there was a smell of burnt electronics that made me think otherwise. As I am 0 for 2 with Belkin UPS reliability, I must warn you not to buy one!!! I have a 6 year old APC that is still going with just battery replacement. I plan to get another one to replace the Belkin."
1,Dissapointment with Belkin,We bought two Battery Back Up Plus Surge Protector units two years ago. Both failed with the slightest power bumps without staying on as designed to protect our computer. Of course they are no longer available. We had to spend a great deal of money and time getting them replaced as Belkin was not very customer friendly. Our third unit just failed and I have been going in circles trying to contact Belkin. I can't even send an email without it being returned unsent.The bottom line is that Belkin is not interested in quality customer service.I will not ever purchase another Belkin product.
5,Halley's Handbook was in better condition than expected and arrived right on time.,I have the book and I marked in it a lot for class so I wanted one for reading and reference. This is a great second copy and Amazon did a great job getting it here.
5,Haley's Bible Review,"I was in Bible Study with several other people, I ordered many books and all were in almost perfect condition. Also, I was able to find several for the people who also wanted them, I think I ended up ordering about 5 or 6! Thanks Amazon.com"
4,"Essential for Bible Study, although Dated","First, the few critiques- the historic quotes from famous men on the significance of the Bible contain several which have been shown to be spurious (esp the one attributed to George Washington); the archaeological supports for the Bible are debatable & dated; and the sections on Church History & The Book of Revelation are heavily Protestant, mildly anti-Catholic(not at Chick or Hislop level) & totally neglects Eastern Orthodoxy.That said, I prefer it to the NIV updating because an honest Church History has to take a few whacks at Roman Catholicism, and the Revelation commentary blends historical, idealist and futurist views, which I regard as a much fuller perspective than the heavily futurist one in the NIV version. I may get the NIV one to supplement my original Halley's, but I'll always go to the original Halley's in my Bible studies.Btw, I totally don't know what the racism charge is about."
3,Invaluable source ...,"Just recently ordered this book, so have not read through it yet. Seems to be interesting."
2,Gets Mt. Ararat wrong,"Halley uses 17,000 ft. high Mt. Ararat in eastern Turkey as Noah's Ark's final resting place when the Bible says mountains of ararat in the book of Genesis. Also, old traditions attribute the Ararat range to a different area than where Mt. Ararat (formerly Mt. Masis) is located.On other points he talks about humankind seemingly only 6,000 years old (as most Biblical versions claim if generations are taken literally in Genesis). Well, like another book written in the early 1960's (The Genesis Flood) this book is out of date badly on the age of humankind as DNA studies have since totally proven human life is much older than the few thousand years these books claim. Unlike the Genesis Flood this book seems to reflect the author's real genuine beliefs."
1,Caused Kindle 2 to Freeze Up,A 1 star rating may not be fair as I didn't get to enjoy the handbook because it caused my Kindle 2 to freeze up.
5,Very helpful book.,"A very helpful book. It seems that it would be invaluable to Bible initiates, and veterans alike."
5,Great addition to anyone's study library,"This is one we each should have. The depth and breadth of the information is awesome. Admittedly, everyone won't agree with all the thelogical/doctrinal assertions of the book. That said, it is well written, and does not use hidden meanings or disguise it's positions. The archeology and history are excellent and the instructions on conducting church are indispensible. You won't be disappointed with this book."
2,Good Idea - Lousy Durability,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She is a big Hannah Montana fan, and loves the brush. Too bad there is no way to change the head - or even the batteries! It is less than 2 months old, the batteries are dead. Now it is just more junk for the landfill.The idea of 2 minute brushing and music combined is a great idea. Too bad the company couldn't have made it to last. I won't be buying another one."
3,Toothbrush idea.,This toothbrush needs a replaceable head to justify the expense. It is too expensive to just use it until the bristles wear out.
4,Hannah Montana gets your daughter to brush!!!,"LOL! I HAD to buy this for my 10-year-old friend, a real Hannah Montana fan! Getting her to brush longer is a bonus. Haven't had it long enough to see the endurance."
5,"QB Vince Young, RB Earl Campbell, RB Priest Holmes, RB Ricky Williams","Several sports writers and commentators, such as the legendary Mel Kiper Jr., have reviewed the titles and stated that they were well done.The title uses the best game highlight footage selected by the coaches, which is called the ""coaches tape,"" and which is later supplied to the NFL scouts as they evaluated these players prior to the NFL April drafts.It was great to hear and see what these scouts had to say about many of these great athletes.""The digital footage is top quality and is accompanied by professional-looking graphics. The narration is brief, letting the action tell the story.""- Ken Thompson, NFL Sports Writer (The Journal and Courier).""Extremely well put together and impressive. Honestly better than I expected. ""- Chris Horwedel, owner of NFL Draft Blitz""I viewed the products from the past two seasons and I loved it!""- Jim Wyatt, Sports Writer and NFL Insider, The Nashville Tennessean."
1,"Some Horror,Some sleaze.","I thought that Death Spa was a alltogether cheezy horror flick. The acting was not great,along with the special effects.The only notable thing about this film is the nude and always ditzy women. A local spa has numerous unexplained deaths and freak accidents. Nobody knows who it is until the end, at a Mardi Grai party. Better off watching ERASERHEAD."
1,The camera lens needs to be wiped!,"Keegan's work serves as an excellent example of how American Indians continue to be photographed and marketed as exotic Others. For Keegan, as well as others who make a living photographing and selling images of ""Indians,"" American Indians only appear photogenic when they are wearing ceremonial regalia. The images of Indians taken at the turn of the 20th century that are slapped along Keegan's work in this text convey Southwestern Indians as frozen in time and unchanging. The picture of modern American Indians is a lot more complex than what is presented in Keegan's much blurred and distorted photography."
5,Healthy Mouth & No More Stinky Doggy Breath!,"This product is great and so is the Amazon price for it!Our dogs seem to love the taste of this product even though it smells very minty and fresh. We'd tried other products that didn't smell as good or give the result that this one does.One of our dogs had very bad plaque build-up when we got her (her teeth looked like she had never chewed on anything hard in her one year of life) and the vet was recommending teeth cleaning. We were already using this product on our other dog and we'd had him since he was a puppy, so we decided to try this first. After about the second week of brushing (brushing twice a week) we could see a dramatic difference in the condition of her teeth and after about six months, her teeth were white and shiny and her gums were healthy. She no longer needed to have her teeth cleaned! We discovered that she wanted to chew on hard toys and bones because her mouth finally felt good enough to do so. This product is truly remarkable!"
2,Broken in a million pieces,"I bought this item as a gift for a gentleman who plays Santa Claus every year. He always mentions this candy. It arrived in a halfway crushed box and the candy was all broken into pieces. This is terrible as I have no choice but to give it as his gift with the time left until Christmas. Very disappointed in the seller of this product. if you sell candy that is to be shipped, then PACK IT to be shipped as ordered."
2,ALL BROKEN!!!,"We have been eating this candy since we were kids and it's hard to find in stores. When I saw it on Amazon I was thrilled..then I read the reviews!! Most people said it was all broken when it came in. I ordered it anyway hoping for the best. Sure enough when I revceived it, it was in tiny smashed pieces..Not in the beautiful ribbons like it's supposed to be..I gave it two stars because the flavor of the candy is still delicious..Can't be served for company though, shame..because it's really delicious."
3,"This is a product comment, not necessarily a comment on the seller","The seller shipped the product quickly and it was as described. My issue with it was that the candy, while tasty enough, was kind of broken up. My ""ribbons"" ended up being more like large rock candy. This may have been a shipping issue or a handling issue I don't know, but it was kind of a let down when you hope for ""ribbons"". Perhaps better packaging would help with this problem."
2,xmas candy,This product came to me stale.I would not oder candy again.I did not send it back and I should have.Will not buy again.
1,Ribbon Candy,Was disappointed with this candy. Wasn't the same quality and most of the ribbons were broken. The flavor was good... just not the same quality I'm used to.
2,Broken,"The shipment arrived within the number of days specified, but the packaging was insufficient. The candy arrived broken, some in quite small pieces."
3,half broke,Ordered these to decorate gingerbread houses and when they arrived in the mail about half of them were broken already....I would this product if you are looking to get unbroken ribbons
1,"This is not you grandmothers ribbon candy, it modern garbage.",This stuff is good in that it is candy and it tastes good but it is thick and nothing like the real old fashion ribbon candy you are looking for.
1,Dont buy,It came broken in pieces. The ribbon was dull and useless. I had to just throw away i don't recommend to anyone
1,not as expected,"i bought this candy out of nostalgia for my childhood. My mother always bought ribbon candy to have around the house at Christmas time. When i saw the product on amazon, i purchased it with the idea of experiencing those same tastes. unfortunately, the candy arrived all broken but it was still edible so i ate some of each color/flavor. None of them had a strong flavor. They tasted very bland, in fact. Did not taste like I recalled from my childhood."
2,Not Your Grandmother's Ribbon Candy,"This brand of ribbon candy is tasty enough but hardly what I'd call thin. If you, like me, are looking for the super-thin (almost glass like) stuff that dear ol' grandma used to serve up at Christmastime, this ain't it.And, as has been my experience more frequently these days, products sold via Amazon are not always the best price. I found this at my local meat specialty shop for almost half what they're asking here."
2,ripoff,i purchased this same product at rite-aid for 1 dollar in the christmas clearance aisle. it tasted delicious--even more so for the price!!!
5,wow what flavor,"Unfortunately some of the ribbons of candy were broken but you have to break off a piece to eat it anyways but the flavor was wonderful, full flavor, not just sweet sugar candy, the orange was my favorite."
5,Lesbian Thelma and Louise...?,"...yes, indeed! Not ordinary way to tell a story. Extraordinary movie. I really like it. I recommend to buy and watch. It is worth it!"
3,Joe + Belle Summary,"It was a reasonably good movie, good acting but the plot was a little basic to say the least. Overall though, it was still worth the price i paid for it. I would not recommend this movie unless the person (friend), insisted that they see it for themselves."
1,not impressed,"I settled down with popcorn and got comfy to watch this movie. After 20 mins into the film I was losing attention and finding the storyline and the acting boring. I never normally stop a film part way through, but for this one I did. What a waste of money."
1,don't waste your time,"My sincerest opinion is that this movie was wholly disappointing on every level - except creepy. It gets five stars for creepy. If you like movies that make absolutely no sense as they develop, take you on a ridiculous dream like (bad dream) encounter, then this is the movie for you. The women were nor even remotely appealing, which might have been a saving grace on some level. The story was NOT sexy at all and was hardly what I would call a love story - now, I only watched it once (because that is all I could take) so maybe I was missing the deeper meaning behind the characters or the plot - but I must say, to me, and I am only one voice out there, this was a waste of money and time - it actually gave me the creeps. If you're a romantic, I would recommend a nice sexy movie like Elena Undone... now there is a sexy story. If you're on some sort of drugs that make you hallucinate, then Joe and belle is for you! Out -"
2,Gold,"I have been a fan of this movie for many yearss and was excited when I found it on Amazon. Unfortunately, the quality of the print is average to poor, and the movie has been edited for language (at least) with periodic gaps in the dialog. There was no mention in the description that it was an edited version and that is a big disappointment. The movie is still great fun, but would have liked to had all the movie, and with a much better video quality."
2,I should've have believed the reviews!,I loved Roger Moore in the Saint and the Persauders.He was good as Bond. I liked most of the movies he'smade but this isn't one. It had Ray Milland that Ilike and Braford Dillman so I figured it was good.The production is cheap and the quality isn't goodso that made it hard to watch. It's more of a lovestory than a ripoff movie. I found it hard to watch.Moore is great as always you can tell he put his effortinto it but it didn't work. Maybe better quality dvdwould help cause it wasn't boring. I can't recommend.buy the Persauders tv series with Tony Curtis! GREAT!
4,Roger Moore- Gold,"One of Moore's best non-Bond films. Realistic, great underground, in-the-mine effects. I would have enjoyed seeing it in widescreen, but apparently it isn't available."
3,poor quality on dvd,"We bought this dvd bonus pack as we like many of the films that are represented. The films are highly recommendable, but the quality of the dvds is poor. One of the films (Mistletoe) was actually so bad that it made our eyes hurt while we watched it. we would therefore not buy a 6 film product like this again."
2,wouldn't resommend for architecture grad schools,"although it's pretty rare to find any specific information on graduate schools for architecture, i was pretty disappointed with this book. if you're looking for gradute schools for fine arts i think you would be more pleased. i could find much more information on the web about architecture schools than in this guide. the information in pretty limited and i don't think it mentions all of the schools. also, it would have been more helpful if the authors included a ranking of schools."
1,Doesn't deserve one star.,"Computer worked fine for 6 months. After that computer began shutting down unexpectedly. We found out that this was an issue with an overheating CPU. Sony has not been helpful, we sent the computer to get fixed by them. When they sent it back the computer worked fine for another 2 months. This has been the worst experience with a laptop that I've ever had from a hardware point of view and from the service that we have received from Sony. You pay extra dollars for a recognizable brand only to get the quality of a cheap brand.Do yourself a favor..... get a Dell."
1,One star - but only because there is no choice for less,"I agree with the first reviews. Never buy Sony Vaio notebooks.The design of the mainboard is really old and is not conceived to support the modern processors, so the notebook overheats and shuts down after some time.I also had a really bad support from Sony, it seems they are joking with customers, they should be aware of this problem and recall the systems for a free repair, instead they ask about 650$.With that money is better to buy a new laptop, surely not from Sony."
5,the coopersville yodeller,This album is great it is quintesencial del from slow hard hitting ballads to just all round toe tapping tunesI cannot recommend this enough or any del music for that matterhe is just GREAT
4,Classic Del Shannon CD Produced by Tom Petty Worth The Wait,"If you liked Del's final album (""Rock On"") which gave a taste of what he might have sounded like in the context of The Traveling Wilburys, here's more of that great flavor.Produced by Tom Petty and backed by The Heartbreakers, Del does what he does best, rocking with authority (""Sucker for Your Love,"" ""Cheap Love,"" etc.) and singing heartbreaking ballads such as his great remake of Don Everly's composition ""Maybe Tomorrow."" His remake of ""Sea of Love,"" which briefly charted, is here and some of Del's best originals in years.Excellent fidelity matches production that reveals it's top flight Petty-gree. Well worth the many years I have waited for this on aluminum!"
5,Fantastic,"Im not gonna say much, but this album is great. Del Shannon had a wonderful voice. My favorite is Out of Time. Even though there all good. I think anyone would be pleased if they bought this album."
5,Drop Down and Get This,"This CD is a real revelation -- a chance for those not familiar with this iconic artist. Produced by Tom Petty, backed by The Heartbreakers, Shannon's CD gives one a hint of why the likes of Harrison, Dylan, Lynne and Petty had no qualms about his being a likely addition to The Traveling Wilburys after Roy Orbison's death."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"I regret the day I bought this game for my teenager. It isn't reality, it isn't even three times removed from reality. Make your teenager go outside or read a book or do chores or get a hobby. Turn the computer off, it's only wasting his life."
1,Terrible,"Asherons Call is a terrible game.The game play is to easy and,all the servers are what some people called ""Tweaked"".Which means the whole point of the game can basically be given to you by someone else.It get VERY VERY boring after your free month maybe thats why it is FREE!!! I do not encourge buying this game....It is very time consuming and you will be glad to turn it off after your first month."
2,This game is just plain boring.,"Even though this game has a HUGE map, great graphics, and everything you need to make the perfect RPG, it still stinks. I know this may sound crazy but it really isint. The main problem is combat. You select where you want to attack (high, medium, or low) and the computer does the rest. Also you have to pay 10.00 a month to play it. There are many other reasons why this game is absolutely no fun to play but trust me it is no fun at all. Remember, great graphics does not make a game, gameplay does."
1,Limited playability,"Sure, this game has got stuff to strut, but the on thing that made me bring it down to that one measily star is that fact that you never own the game. you have to pay to play, which is a factor that certainly draws my attention. When i buy a game, i like to play it online through the company's server that is FREE (how the heck do you think Blizzard does so well??!!). This is in my mind, a typical scam, and ill have no part in it."
1,Pointless Microsoft clone of EQ,"Okay, here it is in a nutshell. The graphics bite, and bite HARD. The spell component system is so difficult that playing hack and slash by default is much more preferable. And there is little if any help by the GMs. My two cents. Buy at your own risk."
3,The most addictive game ever.,"Very stylish. Very engrossing. This game is a divorce in a box, I tell ya.I recently found myself staying up and playing this game from 9PM until 7AM. Does this mean that it is a great game, or does it mean that I am insane?I don't know the answer to that.UPDATE:I've changed my mind. After playing this gems for a few months, I realized that it had turned out to be nothing more than a race to get more items, complete more quests, and build a better character than the next guy.It's not the game developers' fault, though. It's the virtual community that has come to call the game home. The place became so full of ""power-gamers"", that there was no place left for people who just wanted to explore, interact, and role-play. It's disappointing, because this could have been a truly GREAT game. But the players ruined it."
2,Asheron's Call,"Asheron's Call offers an unthinkabally huge world for it's players to adventure in and explore. Over the course of the past year Turbine has gotten considerabally better at lag and down time, responding to its market really well.Pros: Excellent graphics, unique spell system, variety of totally original monster, and social system. Cons: Complete lack of role playing, a primarily classless system leaves most characters rather un-unique, little to do other than ..., very repetitive gameplay."
5,This game is one of my all-time favorites!,"If you don't like crowded towns, build up enough strength tomove out to a non-starter town EXAMPLE: if you started in Rithwic,move it out to Eastham! Plus, if you want to get some items from monsters, you gotta kill them yourself! Anyway, this game is just plain AWESOME! I play it with my friends every single day, and it never wears out. Me and one of my friends are RPG buffs, and we totally LOVE the game! My other friend we play with isn't and RPG buff, (action's more his style) BUT HE PROBABLY LIKES THE GAME MORE THAN WE DO! I highly reccomend."
4,Fun,"This game is very fun... though it is fairly addictive. For any one who wants to play something in the summer when they have nothing else to do, I would defintinly reconmend. It has best graphics when you have your inventory showing. Again, I think this game is great. Once you start playing it, you cannot stop playing. I WOULD DEFININTLY RECCOMEND IT! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"
3,I'm addicted - but getting bored,"I've been playing AC for about 20 months. The game was outstanding for the first several months. The landscape plus the challenge of creating an allegiance of other players to complete quests was fun. As the game went on, cheaters and hackers have ruined the game. Turbine almost refuses to discipline or ban them, I guess they're afraid to lose money. The last 6-8 months, I've noticed that very, very, very few people are joining the game. While turbing has worked to provide low level content, it's not being used. The high level content is there mostly for mages. Warriors are pretty much left out of the fun. In fact, just the other day, my level 67 warrior was having kills stolen by a level 42 mage!!! This should just not happen."
2,Technical loser,"Yes, Asheron's Call is the best of all on-line RPGs, but that's like saying I'd rather have my toes chopped off than lose a leg. You never get a chance to love the great features in this game because of all the snafus. Servers constantly go up and down, even with good DSL service it became hard to hold a connection, be prepared to reconfigure your computer to get the thing to work, and most of all LAGS, LAGS, LAGS!!!!!! In the towns you can walk two steps, lag for 5 secs, walk 2 more, wait another 5 secs, etc. It all gets to be particularly irritating when these glitches appear during combat. Whoops, you're dead! Whoops, where am I? Maybe in 5 years the technology will have advanced to the point that all of this will work. But for now online RPGs are simply an exercise in frustration."
5,Amazing Book,"In this amazing book Carol Miller, an amazing writer, takes us through five key areas: China, Tibet, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Travel, keen observations of the land and its people, and personal anecdotes blend with succinct and comprehensive treatment of history and background, to give the reader depth and understanding. We see not only what these countries are but how they came to be. I will read anything Carol Miller writes but in addition, I would give anything to be able to travel with her, anywhere in the world! Assuming, of course, I could keep up with her."
3,"Great Classic, Poor Edition","This is very good work by the fearless Puritan John Flavel. The whole book is basically a discourse on Proverbs 4:23: ""Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life"". There are wonderful insights and powerful exhortations dealing with the subject of heart-keeping, and the writing style is easily understood, the sections concise and straightforward. The only drawback is the particular edition Amazon sells - the fascimilie is full of technical errors in punctuation, words cut-off, sentence jumbling. It can get to be a little distracting, like a trainwreck in the middle of a paragraph, severing your concentration till you figure out and try and piece together the typographical error.Otherwise, a very helpful book for believers concerned with keeping their hearts pure before God. Highly recommended."
2,Unrelated,The post office isn't hiring it's going to be hard to leap in front of military personel anyway a waste of money
2,No New Jobs at USPS,"In September, 2011, United States Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe asked Congress for permission to lay off 120,000 postal employees. The US Postal Service is trying to get rid of people, not hire them. There may possibly be a few new temporary jobs in the future but don't get your hopes up about getting a career job with the USPS in the immediate future."
1,Disappointed,A little dsappointed in the quality of this ring. Doesn't look half as nice in person as it does in the catalog.
1,"DO NOT BUY ""LITTLEST PET SHOP"" TOYS HERE!!!","I love Amazon but DO NOT buy ANY ""Littlest Pet Shop"" toys here. $22 is a crazy price for this. Like the last post stated...you can buy any of the pets at Toys R' Us, Walmart, and Target for under $5."
1,"DON""T BUY HERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Go to the Hasbro Web site!! They have them for $3.33 and free shipping on $50.00 or more!!! The horse is in stock last I looked!
3,God didn't take her from us - he did!,"Okay, you know the drill - there's a killer on board the plane, a controller is sweating over the microphone and scouring the city for a psychologist, the plane teems with the suspicious.MURDER ON FLIGHT 502 is cheesy fun. It owes its existence to the popularity of real movies like AIRPORT and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. Like those predecessors, this made-for-television movie (1975) is chock full of familiar faced guest stars. Small screen stalwarts like Hugh O'Brien and Robert Stack, had-beens like Walter Pidgeon and Ralph Bellamy, almost-weres like Fernando Lamas and Polly Bergen, annoying gadflies like Sonny Bono and Danny Bonaduce. Directed by George McCowan, who went on to direct television's ""Fantasy Island,"" which ought to be all the warning you need.Don't expect too much and you shouldn't be disappointed. I was either lucky or this movie was very transparent - I figured out who the killer was before the end of the first act. Pleasant in polyester."
4,Great cookware but some odor retain issue,"A very versatile and visually attractive cookware piece. I have owned it for three months now and have used it almost daily with excellent results.Yesterday I cooked carrots and endives in butter and after washing this braiser, a faint food odor remained. It did not happen with other dishes cooked previously such as braised leeks and onions or tomato sauce. I left the braiser overnight, lid on, after putting some powder bicarbonate (Arm and Hammer)in. It did not remove the odor. Washed it again with lukewarm water and put in freshly squeezed lemon juice. After 8 hours ""soaking"" it with lemon juice I was able to remove the odor although it has now a (nice) faint lemon odor. YES, I did follow EH instructions on boiling milk etc, before using it for the first time. Despite of this issue, I am very pleased with this EH braiser."
1,Terribly Disappointed,"I love the way the Flame Top cookware looks and great to go from the stove top to the table. However, the products are terrible to cook in. Everything burns, even with a small light. The only thing that doesn't burn and stick is soup. They are a very inferior cooking utensil as compared to metal pots and pans. I really wish that they were more functional because they are so attractive."
4,Awesome Game,"This game is GREAT. I love the season mode as well. and don't worry there are no ""GLITCHES"" in this game unlike WM21 for Xbox. Over all worth buying if you like the first DOR."
4,Kyle Rhodes,I've haven't played the game yet. But I might buy it on the 1st of november. If you'll want to write me comments about the game. Like is it better than smackdown vs. Raw 06? Or does wwe day of reckoning 2 has the elimination chamber or the buried alive match? My email address is thekingis2@hotmail.com
2,"Same thing, but a little diffrent","This is a very bad game. It is the exact same thing as last year. The only diffrence is new wrestlers, entrances, and one new match (last man standing). There are also no superstar voice overs,and there is just only 40 superstars(including the 5 legends). So don't get this game unless you don't have the original day of reckoning."
4,a good game,this is a good game but rent it before buying it i only played it for the new roster but that gets boring after a while
3,2 months,"I ordered this game 2 days ago and i checked my order info. I'm gonna recieve it on November 1! WTH! I've been antcipating this game for a year and now i have to wait 2 months to get it! Screw you, Amazon!"
2,I hate THQ!!!!!!!!!,"First off, let me say this game totally sucks! One complaint I have about it is that the rosters are STILL totaly out of date! Yeah, I know that it is supposed to be a continuation of the first Day of Reckoning, but at least put Batista on Smackdown! The controls are sluggish and unresponsive, it is impossible to win by pinfall, the camera angles are confusing, and there is STILL no voiceover or commentary! In this day and age, no voiceover or commentary is just plain sad. Also, Create-a-championchip, create-a-pay per view are also absent in this GameCube version, but automatically included in Smackdown vs. RAW 2006. THQ is totally biest to PS2 and Xbox. If they had just included all of these features and less frustrating gameplay, this could have one of the greats, but since they didn't, it is one that will be on the hall of shame. Screw you, THQ!!!!!"
4,The ups and downs,Okay the ups are there are good characters and good moves. Some more are the good create an entrance. The downs are there are no voice overs bad season and not enough legends. It took me like 1 year to complete game. If you want the best wretling game buy svr 2006
1,Don't Waste Your Time Or Money,"this game sucks!! although it's no surprise considering that EVERY SINGLE ONE of the Gamecube wrestling titles are crap. Well THQ,you sure didn't disappoint, cause you've come up w/ cruddy game #4. THQ hasn't done anything right for WWE since the n64 when it was still WWF. ok, ok, amazing graphics yeah. so? the gameplay? B.S. the A.I.? riiiight. story line? try stealing one that didn't happen 2-3 years ago. completely ridiculous! 2 words for you ""No Mercy"" take a lesson and dust off your n64 cause THQ hasn't figured out the gamecube yet."
2,Not as much fun as the first one.,I played the first Day Of Reckoning into the ground!This one is MUCH harder to control. I'm just glad Ionly paid about $2 for it.
4,Good Astronomy,Nice history of telescopes and all associated equipment. He opens the heavens for both amateurs and professionals and makes for easy reading.
4,sportz tent,"Easy to put up plenty of room inside, The tent fits my truck like it was suposed to this was worth every dollar."
3,don't get the large print edition,"The first letters on the lines of too many pages didn't print. One letter I could guess, two letters is frustrating.Still glad I got it. A book written in my mother and grandmother's day. Some things change, some things don't."
5,Mencken as expected,"I have a fondness for this man's biting humor; therefore, this book was no disappointment. The only regret is that it was written long before so many changes have occured in the status of women since 1918. Too bad we cannot have his comments on the current state of affairs. If you like Mencken this is a good additiion to your Mencken collection. His overall approach toward women is positive, too often rare no matter the date of the writing."
2,Disappointing Compilation,"We purchased this set of ""Our Gang"" DVD's hoping that it would be a fairly comprehensive compilation.We were disappointed.Unfortunately many of the shorts are repeated on the DVD's. So rather than getting a different episode each time you get the same episodes (but in different sequence) on different discs. This is what I would call a RIP-OFF. When 8 discs of episodes are advertised as a set, they ought to be 8 discs of DIFFERENT episodes.There are other disappointments associated with the purchase of this set. There are no episodes with Miss McGillicutty. As well, the episodes chosen tend to be fairly violent.All in all, this is a disappointing compilation of a much loved series."
4,They're as different as night and day............,"He's the red hot d.j of Kennedy High's radio station , at the very pulse of the school's social scene. She's a cool , disciplined iceskater , too busy training to enjoy old friends or scool activities . They're the two people least likely to fall in love , right?? Wrong !!! Unexpected circumstances throw them together , and Lisa and Peter discover that they maybe made for each other after all."
4,Real World Advise - Real World Results,"As a professional trainer, I am always looking for video sessions that compliment my workshops and seminars. Once in a while I'll come across a gem like Chuck Hoffman's ""Get a Job Fast."" Not only is it relevant still today, it has that nice motivational touch at the end. All the points he makes are excellent and valid. His style is interesting, although a bit slow in places, Chuck tells it like it really is...Not only do I use his suggestions for each job search class I facilitate, I've successfully used them myself to obtain consulting and training contracts. Chucks' video has become a backbone to my training resource library."
3,"Rainy day, go away!","Much like ""Kid's Favorite Songs,"" the production values on this tape are pretty poor. The video consists almost entirely of the contrived setup: a sudden rainstorm traps Zoe, Telly, Gabbi and some other kid-actor types inside Finders Keepers (the neighborhood junk store) without any adult supervision. Mumford appears briefly, almost unrecognizable to my two-year-old as he's both out of costume and context. Most of the songs aren't clips, but are sung by the kids in the store.There is one saving grace to this video: a terrific clip with Ernie singing ""Imagine That,"" the song where he imagines himself a knight and a brave sailor, only to illustrate the fun in being himself in his own home. The only other worthwhile clips are live-action clips of kids, one is ""Happy Happiness,"" with kids playing on the beach.I'd buy this for the Ernie clip, but don't expect too much from the rest."
3,Tone Deaf Hateful Children,"I'm watching right now with my 2 year old daughter for the 40th time. For a 28-year old, I'd rather be at the dentist office. However she really enjoys it and she just shouted out the word ""recycle"" so though Sesame Street isn't like when I was a kid, it keeps her busy."
4,Great quality pen...but a bit heavy,Great quality....but a bit on the heavy side. Good for signing etc....but uncomfortable to hold for a prolonged period. Refill quality is great.
1,IT WAS BROKEN INTO PIECES INSIDE,"I really don't know what could happend to this VCR trough out the shippment but when I received it from UPS it was damaged in such a way that I thougt it was a bad joke..... I opened the box, just took a look of what it was left and inmeditely closed the box, I was really disapointed.I can't rate this VCR because I never even plug it into the wall."
3,Remote headaches,"I have been using a Panasonic 4660 for the last year and half, and have been very pleased with it (great picture/sounds, nice features like automatic commercial advance). I purchased this unit so that we could watch and record tv at the same time. I had no problems connecting the 4611 (unlike other reviewers here), and did not find the motor to be particularly loud.The unit doesn't suit my needs, though, because all Panasonic VCRs use the same remote control codes. Every time I use the remote, both VCRs would respond. Panasonic tech support suggested a piece of cardboard over the receiver..."
1,POS,"I recieved mine as a gift for Xmas, after trying 3 brand new tapes in it and getting the same result, no sound or bad cracking noises, I put it back in the box and returned it. I really cant comment on any of the features because I didn't even get that far."
3,"Setup Headaches, But Good Value","This is a really light, inexpensive, and easy machine to connect. The instructions are easily understood and have good illustrations. Picture delivered is clear. Took me about 10 minutes to put in use.My only problems came during initial setup. As usual, so many small buttons on the remote make it difficult to see what your doing. The commands come up quick, so if you're not watching or miss something, you're kinda stuck. I managed to accidentally lock in French (I think) instead of English to the commands on the set, but nonetheless was able to work around this error.Good value for the price. I'd definately buy it again."
2,Did not last...,"I always loved Panasonic VCRs. This one just did not last. Even after regular cleaning, the thing eats tapes. Even pulled it apart and cleaned it by hand. No change. Just over a year old."
1,Think carefully before you buy this one!!!,"[Are you wanting to buy this?}...don't bother. I had the Mod 4021-- TWO of them which Amazon.com graciously accepted back. They both had lines and screen ""noise"" and poor sound. So I decided the 4611 would be the answer to the problem. WRONG! Same old same old. It records fine: that tape plays back on ANOTHER VCR fine. But the playback on this machine, whether taped there, or at another source, is bad bad bad. Tracking clears it for a few minutes, then it goes bad again. I tried diff. brand tapes, two different TV's. Nothing worked, so I returned it. Don't buy it, unless you can easily return it to your merchant!"
3,All depends on what you want to use it for,"The vcr seems like it works fairly well, plays rental tapes and things recorded on it just fine...has a fair amount of features for the price as well. I do have one major disappointment, tapes recorded on it cannot be viewed on other vcrs, and tapes recorded on other vcrs cant be viewed on it either...I have tried it with Phillips and Magnavox VCRs, and had no success. Since my situation is that I need to record things in one room during the day to be watched at night when my family sleeps in another, this doesnt work for me. If it was your sole VCR, I think it would be a perfectly adequate choice."
2,"Not so good, it broke !","I would have given this no stars, but it did work when it first came. Set-up was ok, it is a bit loud and you can not record and watch a different channel at the same time. ( kinda what VCRs are for )It was grainy when you record, and the sound was ok.Now like I said this might just be the unit I got, but I would not buy this again. I am going to spend the extra money and buy something better."
1,returned for credit,i returned this vcr on 2-1-02&have not recieved credit on my account. i would like to buy a different vcr when you credit my account.its been 2weeks &nothing is has been done
5,Great Fun,"I loved reading about Freyja Bedwyn. She is a fiercely independent and strong woman, which is refreshing to read about. This book is very funny too."
3,Rather Tedious,"You have the opportunity to read more indepth reviews, mine will be succinct. Freyja is a difficult heroine but I think could have been made more likeable if those glimpses of humor were fleshed out more. Joshua was a likeable rogue with a quick wit. Freya's character needed to loosen up. The storyline got tiresome and it was a chore to finish the book. I understand pride but Freyja's became mulish. I would have given 2 stars but I liked Josh's character. He had many layers without being brooding and sullen"
2,Grrrr.....,"I would have liked the book more, if the whole plot about the Bedwyns had been more original.It seems to me that the author is trying to imitate Jo Beverley's Mallorens (I prefered the Mallorens a whole lot better than the Bedwyns!) Look at the similiarities in the two series: four brothers and two sisters, including an intimidating eldest brother( Rothgar in the Mallorens case and Wulf in the Bedwyns case). Even their names are similar. Rothgar's actual name is Beowulf and Wulf's is actually Wulfric. My, what a coincidence!I'm quite disappointed in mary balogh this time round. The Bedwyns will never take the place of the Mallorens."
2,"book seperated from spine on second page , large hole, smelled bad",The book looked great but I opened it to the second page and it is seperated from the spine of the book. I was more than a little aggravated Yes it is a used book but it is also a damaged book. also had a smell to it You can read it but it won't last long and it was intended for a gift which is no longer possible.
2,Disappointed for Freyja. She deserves better. Very boring. Hero too foppish.,"I was very disappointed in this book. I could barely make my way through it, and I only did because I kept thinking ""this is going to get better."" I was wrong. I really liked Freyja's character development in a Summer to Remember, and I had hopes for the hero that win her over. This hero is foppish with his colored coats and teasing and constantly grinning manner. I don't like this type of hero, but if you do, then maybe you would enjoy this book. The characters talk a lot, but there is no buildup of any desire. I though a Summer to Remember was fine, not great, but I have no desire to read this author's other books."
2,A stepping stone ....,I did not like Freyja or Joshua. I thought he was too shallow and she had a nasty disposition. I only read the book because it is part of a sequence and I needed to pass through these characters in order to get to Wulfric. So far I have liked Aiden the best and look forward to Wulfic's story. There is nothing wrong with the story or the way the book is written. I just did not like the characters.
4,enjoyed reading,4th in series a fake betrothed turns to love.the bedwyn are a great clan balogh makes you feel like a part of the family.will read on.
5,another winner,"The ""scandalous"" series so far has kept up a high standard with unique plot lines and well rounded characters.I started with the first and read in sequence, but it would not be necessary and each is a good stand alone read.I can't wait to read about Wulf--just as with Freyja in the earlier books I had to wonder how she could pull it off. She seems to have really dug a hole so far with him and I can't wait to see how she handles him in his story.I would definitely recommend all the books in this series."
1,Don't buy this garbage,"The clock is unreliable. It will run perfectly for a few days, then lose a few minutes. Today, it lost 45 minutes in five hours.The reception from the outdoor transmitter is awful. If you're over six feet away, expect to ""sync"" a few times a week when it loses the signal.I've only had this junk for a few weeks, and yes, I changed the brand new batteries just in case."
3,"not too bad, its a great little clock","When you use good quality, new batteries, this clock works fine.I put the wireless transmitter about 15 feet away, and this works well.My only complaint is that its hard to see at night, or in a dark room."
3,5 starts in the beginning,"When I first played this game, I was so impressed. It was like you are really in a battle field killing for victories.But after a while.... (3 days later)... it becomes not so exciting and kind of boring actually, because all you do is killing and killing, not much with any strategies. Anyway, you should have a try if you have not played this series before."
3,If you own Dynasty Warriors 2 then dont rush for this one...,"If you loved Dynasty Warriors 2, played to completion twice then buy this - its just more levels of the same. There are very, very few differences between 2 and 3 (i.e. GFX, music, gameplay, control bugs etc etc etc are all the same).Personally i loved DW2 and will enjoy this, but if you're no die-hard then look elsewhere."
4,dw3,dw3 is a very fun game the only bad thing is some of the levels are hard. But if you play it a lot it is all easy.
4,Great game and very addictive,What a great game!The graphics are superb!If anyone has played DW2 get this game!Even if you havent played it get this game when you play it you'll not want to stop!
3,More of the Same,"Dynasty Warriors 3 is more of the same kill everything that moves type of game but offers some new modes and features. Noticably, it offers 2 player CoOp. It would have been classic if the 2p CoOp was on one screen but KOEI decided to go spilt screen. Bad choice if you ask me. I hate split scren."
4,Dynasty Warriors 3,"The only problems I have come across in this game is that if there are a large number of people on the screen near you some of them will disappear, but still be able to inflict damage on you. Also it can be difficult to level up your bodyguards as they die in just a couple hits. Otherwise it is a great game that my husband and I enjoy playing together."
5,A wonderful game,I love this game so much. KOEI always makes good historical games and it's most successful game series is SanGuo(Dynasty Warrior). I have played the game for a few months and got all the weapons and equipment. I am looking forward the next generation of this game.
1,Not impressed,The tools were definitely made somewhere in Asia (I think you know where that is). They were covered in some sort of strange sticky grease. The titanium was merely a gimmick to make you think they were good for drilling hardened metals. When I tried to do so all I succeeded in doing was making a completely blunt drill bit. The majority bits also were not even close to being straight so you would get an oblong hole if you were to succeed in drilling one. But I suppose you get what you pay for.
1,My Fault for now reading the item description and reviews,"These are absolute garbage. I ordered them in a hurry and didn't read the item description or reviews. Shame on me.These are high speed steel bits with a light layer of something gold in color. The first time I tried to drill steel, the gold color came off.The bits are very low quality. Some have inconsistent diameter on the length of the bit. Very poor quality - its hard to describe, but they metal in the bits has a rough texture like it was made in a very low quality process.With the half inch bit, I couldn't even start a hole in mild steel."
1,Great Title --- But Lousy CD,Very poor quality sound on this CD. Good song titles but bad versions of them. Other than that go ahead and buy it.
4,Why not! I loved it!,"This is a really interesting game that teaches you about farm life. I live on one and I diddn't know half the problems that can occur. Cow shot by hunter, fence cut by hunter, wild dogs lose 2 cows, purcase furtilizer and chemicals pay $2000, electric bill,purcase parts for corn planter, pasture rent. But you also get income, sell old machnery, sell new fence posts,sell fresh eggs,insurence pays for damage to crops, pultry sold. You get the idea. The board is a llarge size with a wide variety of spaces. It has a small Monopoly felling since it has taxes and milk check. My sister diddn't like it but I don't think she has ever sat playing a game for over half a hour. The board bent but I don'd remember if that was are fault or not I think it was. The game takes about a hour."
5,An Exciting and MOOving Game,"Life on the Farm is suggested for children up to 12 years old, we old enough to be adults in our family and we love it. We are a family of people with special interests and backgrounds in farming (some of us in Dairy Farming). We had fun playing it during the Christmas holidays. We laughed so hard that we had trouble keeping going.The manufacturer recommended the game for people up through 92 years of age. Why discriminate?It is a fast-moving game, and the situations are realistic. There is a certain amount of skill required along with luck. This game is is nothing but wholesome fun, like fresh milk.It would make an ideal gift for farm families and for any little group wanting to relax over a clever board game."
5,living together in the masaki residence isnt very peaceful,this is one of the funniest tenchi ova eps i have ever seen i especially like washuu's experiments on tenchi that cracked me up i just has to rewined it again and again too bad she didnt get that last sample.
2,"Starts Well, But Deteriorates Quickly","Jay Caselberg's ""Wyrmhole"" starts out with a lot of promise: an interesting concept and setting coupled with good, clear writing. But, that promise quickly deteriorates. The further you get into the book, the more you're aware that the main character, a variant of an investigator, has no people skills, no organizational skills, no technical skills, and no INVESTIGATIVE skills. He basically moves through the book by thrashing around and luckily finding others to follow up on the hints he gets from his psychic skills. How we're supposed to believe that he could ever put food on the table as an investigator I don't know. Couple this with a lack of a logical progression through the plot and I can only charitably give it a Pretty Bad 2 stars out of 5."
3,"Interesting, even gripping in a way, but...","Jack's supposed to be supernaturally intuitive, but instead he comes off as lazy, unaware, and stupid. Part of this is bad writing; he puts it all together on one page and three pages later, he's putting the very SAME thing together. I don't think he forgot; the writer did. The world around him is full of people with the same short attention span as Jack, too. The setting itself is a lackadaisical world-view made manifest. In the end Jack wants to break out of all that, but he won't; he'll take it with him."
3,A Light In My Window,A pretty excellent book. Francena H. Arnold is a classic Chrisian novelist. Good book.
4,Like Christmas???,"This movie is like Groundhog Day, but at the Christmas season. It is also a teaching tool in regards to the Christmas spirit of giving instead of receiving."
3,Groundhog's Day for Christmas,"I like the premise of this movie - it's essentiallyGroundhog Daywith a Christmas theme. It has a warm plot and good moral. However, Jay Mohr is kind of an odd fit for the lead role of Kevin. He seems out of place as an actor and has a less than serious demeanor. The in-laws aren't particularly lovable themselves and initially treat Kevin so horribly that it almost makes his attitude justifiable. The film could have used an overall better ensemble of actors and characters."
2,Don't Even Think About It,"Had the main character been as endearing as Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day"" this may have been more palatable. Since that was not the case you kept hoping for something redeeming or different. Not gonna happen. So this just isn't really worth your time. In fact it will quite possibly give you a headache watching the same pieces shown over and over so you can see what he does different to try to fix it. I can suggest far to many Christmas movies that are better. On a replayability scale ""Christmas Do-over"" won't be done over, so this gets a zero."
2,Rip Off,Search out the original 1996 TV movie Christmas Everyday. This movie is so poorly acted and so not that funny its just plain BAD.
2,annoying in the same way as Ground Hog Day,"This movie has a decent plot but becomes annoying along the lines of the movie Gound Hog Day. The same day being played over and over again get real old for me. Nonetheless, worth seeing once."
5,Great movie!,"This movie is definitely one that is worth watching! Yes, it is like Groundhog's Day and Christmas Everyday, that is what makes it so great! I personally think the comedy is even better in this one."
2,Ripoff of Groundhog Day....,"....minus the laughs. It's not too terrible, thus the 2 stars instead of 1, but there are too many stupid parts to warrant even 3 stars. The acting is sub-par for otherwise good actors, too. Obviously they were trying to repeat the success of Groundhog Day, but it definitely does not deliver."
3,Good while it lasted,"This was a very nice sponge for bathing our baby, but it didn't last too long. It started breaking apart with little flakes coming off, which very soon after turned into larger parts. At the end, large chunks came off and it became impossible to use anymore."
2,Bathe away,"Initially I was quite pleased with this sponge, but after only six weeks it is falling apart. I expected a longer life from this sponge, so I am trying another brand. Crabtree and Evelyn sold a much better sponge, but they no longer offer them so I am still looking for a comparable one."
2,Save your money!,"Bought for my 7 year old daughter, played a few times just to give it a chance, the game just doesn't make any sense...and the directions don't help clarify. Waste of time and money."
3,Good source for who wants to understand Engineering Design,"I found this book to be a very good source for who wants to understand Engineering design. It is well structured and explains the design process in a very clear manner. The design project management part of the book gives good practices that are applicable in any type of projects. Just for this I strongly recommend this book. However, I would have stayed away from the drafting and sketching technics, as well as the computer illustration. I found it steered the reader away from how a design project is conducted."
2,"Full of information, needs editing, and focus","The first four chapters of this book are very useful, but they are short and jumbled. The information in the appedicies is more useful than the rest of the text. It provides an entires methodology for using programs to complete projects.'The biggest problem I see with this book is the grammatical errors, at least two per chapter as well as spelling mistakes such as wonder. ie ""people continuously wonder to and away from the presenter."" the word is wander. These are doctors at Penn. State, they should be able to spell.anyway there is probably better books out there but this one was fairly inexpensive and does have alot of information."
1,Junk..,This thing is junk. The plastic peices don't stay together. I wouldn't waste your money. I couldn't even give it away in our garage sale.
1,Pieces (120) of CRAP,You would need to be an engineer to figure this toy. It comes with no guides or instructions. A child five and up could never have the patience to fool with this. The pieces do not fit properly and it falls apart too easily. A huge waste of money. DO NOT BUY !
5,"Children of all ages love this ""toy.""","My husband and I, our children and our 6 grandchildren all love to build the runs with this toy. We have 3 complete sets now and we can set the runs up across the whole room. It's easy for the little ones (18 months) to make simple towers and the 3 - 6 year olds love the challenge of making more intricate designs. My daughter (32) and I (61) also really enjoy building intricate runs. I recommend this toy to everyone."
5,Fast & Easy,"This, for me, is better than the more advertised language learning product. It uses common language/ sentences used in normal conversation. Easy and fast and I can listen to it anytime of day, anywhere, safety permitting. Another Highly Recommended product!"
4,book is OK,The book Dari-English-Dari is exactly what I thought it would be and arrived 20 days after my paiement. So: everything perfect.
4,Dari Dictionary and Phrasebook,Great for everyday use and easy learning. My Afghani interpreters liked it. Only issue was the numbers had a mistake - the 90s were incorrect.
3,Good bag but shipping is a ripoff,"I had a couple of problems with the strings popping out of the eye holes, because they aren't tied-in - they're just held in by a knot at the end of the string that's bigger than the hole. Outside of that, the bag is pretty nice for the price.I wasn't happy with the vendor, however. I bought 4 bags, got charged $15 shipping, he didn't ship for a week, and when he did, he just stuffed em in a mailing bag and shipped USPS. For $15/shipping charge and a total shipping weight of about 8-9 oz, you expect more."
5,Go for it,"Absolutely fabulous. I bought the Royal, the color is amazing. I paid around 3 times the cost of the bag for shipping, but really worth it. I will buy another.Please note it's relatively small, see its dimensions and make sure it meets your needs."
5,Missing someone is hard for a child to understand,"This is a wonderful book for everyone, but since it is really marketed for children, this is how I will comment on this book. This story will help children not to be afraid and sad when someone they are missing, whether it be through death or by distance, are still in their heart. Just the way the story is told any child will feel comforted by the fact that they are always connected by the feelings in their heart to another loved one. This book will help if a pet has died or just went to live somewhere else. If a friend had to move away or if a parent just went to work. I bought it because my sister-in-law is very sick and will not be living to much longer. She has a 6 year old daughter and I thought this book would help to know that her mommy still loves her and that she is still with her in her heart."
4,great message,great book for kids with separation anxiety or who have experienced grief & loss. Helps them understand that even when people are away from us we are still connected to them.
5,Great for a gift!,"Liked it so much we ordered 2, one to keep in the permanent library at our preschool!"
3,Okay,"I heard from a friend with elemnatry aged kids that this was a great book so I got it, but I have to say that one of the books we already had teaches something similar and I think it is way more cute for toddlers and preschoolers. Check out this book and see if it will work for your needs.I Love You All Day Long"
3,Be aware of references to heaven,"I wasn't crazy about this book for a couple of reasons. First, it starts out with the two kids being scared because there's a thunderstorm. We tell our daughter that thunder and lightning are parts of nature, and that they're nothing to be afraid of, so I'd rather she not be given an example of kids who are so scared of storms that they can't stay in bed. Second, this book talks about an uncle in heaven. If that fits with your views, no problem, but it doesn't fit with ours. Nonreligious/agnostic/secular parents should know the reference is there before buying."
3,Simple story - nice concept,"I really like the message of this book - we are always connected to each other -- the story is quite simple. It is not a well-written book. Without support, the s ideas could be lost; for the story is quite simple.It almost takes away from the idea. It wold have been. Ice to have included some related activities."
5,Love this book,"This book has helped me and my kids with separation after his dad and I divorced. Good book, in good shape, no markings, fast shipping. Love getting books from Amazon much cheaper than other places."
5,Adorable book!,"This book was everything I hoped it would be & more. With the recent passing of my fiances' mom, we struggled with the best way to explain death to our 2 year old daughter. What I like about this book is the invisible string between people works in situations such as death or military deployment or living far away from family. I highly recommend it!"
5,WOW!! I Love Your Book!!,"Wow! I Love your Book!!!!!!!It is a real revelation!I really liked the detailed bible scriptures, and study you brought to this revelation. Your approach is straight to the point.It is truly revealing, not a bunch of ramble. As a reader I got the point, It had wonderful references.You did a great job. This book alone is a study guide.

3,A good movie with a memorable soundtrack.,I enjoyed watching the movie during my high school years in England (now live in the U.S.A.). I purchased the original sound track but have it only on a vinyl record. Listening to this one brings back old memories. Hazel O' Connor is a good singer. It appears she had little success after this movie soundtrack. I would count this soundtrack as her master piece. I never heard about her after leaving England. This soundtrack is very differcult to find.
5,"A raw, powerful, materpiece of early 80's punk/new wave.","I saw the film on HBO in the early 80's and i never forgot the music. I finally got hold of the soundtrack on CD and it was everything I remember: a raw, powerful, materpiece of early 80's punk. I am so glad that there are many out there who agree. For punk/new wave fans a must have."
5,Ditto from me! I have just about worn out my cassette.,Other than getting a CD copy of BREAKING GLASS I would be in seventh heaven if ! could get a video copy of the movie. Pretty heavy words for a 59 year old.
1,Painfully Uninspired,"Let's face it: Breaking Glass is a suffocatingly terrible film, and a big part of why it is so dreadful is the wretched music. It sounded like pseudo-angst ridden pap in the eighties, and now it simply sounds dated. Save your milk money for something else."
3,cheaper to buy 7 and upgrade,"CS2 is OK, but rather than pay full new price, why not buy PS 7.0 for $142 and upgrade to CS2 for similar $, ending up with CS2 for $300?"
2,Non intuitive and full of bugs,"After 3 days of intensive learning I still can't do some very basic things, it takes me sometimes hours of research to do the most simple things ... like gradient painting a circle object while it takes one intuitive action with my previous software to do that. I find Photoshop CS2 is too complexe in its structure, vocabulary and workflow philosophy for the occasional user. I reckon it takes at least 2 full weeks of training to manage this software, far too much in my opinion, I mean we're talking of image processing ... in comparaison it took me 1 week to manage Autocad and about 2 weeks for a FEA pro softaware."
5,Good Program,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife. I use W2000Pro, so needed penultimate version. Shipment was very quick, product as advertised, easy install, excellent results..."
1,Photoshop CS2 is a terrible program.,"PS CS2 is a terrible program. There are a couple of major bugs I found:First, and most annoying, is it's 'sluggishness'. For example, there is often a lapse of a second or two from the time you try to execute a command and that command actually starts. While this may not be too serious a problem for a novice, it is a real pain when you are trying to use the program professionally on a powerful computer.Second, the new ""Bridge"" is a total flop. It's too slow to use, and full of bugs. For example, it sometimes loses files! That's an unacceptable bug, but it still hasn't been fixed by Adobe. Some files, like large tiffs, won't preview at all. And that's only the beginning!PS CS is a much more stable and reliable program compared to CS2. In fact, I uninstalled CS2, got a refund from Adobe, and went back to CS."
1,I'm furious about this!,"I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2. It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit. Technical support was of no help. I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine. I am so frustrated about this. I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling. If I were a small business, I would be out of business. All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit. Totally unacceptable!"
1,FAKE!!!,"I purchased this item thinking it was authentic. I was wrong. It kept asking me to register it everytime i opened it up. So i called Adobe annd had them run the serial number for verification and it came back invalid. The seller made a prompt refund, and had excellent communication. It was just unfortunate. So be very aware of high priced software for really cheap, even on Amazon!!!"
2,Bridge & Camera Raw Plug-In don't work on my computer,"I love Photoshop, and have worked with all the previous versions, so I was very disappointed when I found that I could not get the Bridge to open or the Camera RAW plug-in to work on my Windows XP machine. I wasted hours and hours of my life on the phone to technical support, but they could not resuscitate this version on my computer. They never were able to tell me why I could not get these two key features to work. Without them, CS2 was virtually useless to me. My computer was only a little under 2 years old. Perhaps you will have better luck..."
4,"As expected, for a classic.","Photoshop is a little tough to use, but extremely powerful for photo manipulation.The browser combined with the RAW editor is a great combination to process the quantities of RAW pictures I take with my trusty EOS 20D.In the rare cases I do red eyes (that unfortunately still, though rarely) happens, I would like an easy tool to get rid of that, like Paint Shop Pro provides.Photoshop works extremely fast on dual-core CPUs like my AMD64 X2."
1,Be careful of fakes,"I purchased a ""new"" copy from a reseller here on Amazon. Everything looked great. I am not a heavy photoshop user, but need it when I need it. About 3 month go by when I noticed some of the functions and keyboard commands did not work. I searched adobe's user forum and realized I received a fake copy. It had a complete user manual, packaging, etc. Even had a fake registration page that doesn't actually connect to adobe. Amazon was great with their A-Z Guarantee and covered it. But, BE CAREFULL. If the price looks too good, it probably is. My copy came from FL if that helps anyone."
4,A worthwhile Investment,"I purchased this product several years ago as a Christmas Present for my son. He has aspirations of getting into the Graphic Arts field professionally. I thought the product was a bit pricey and because I really didn't have any past experience with simular products I wasn't quite sure about the purchase. I asked around, then read some of the reviews here online. I think that if you plan on learning the ins and outs of graphic arts/photography in general this is a great investment. Not only for the student but also for the person thinking about a small business. There are so many things you can do and learn with this product its unbelievable. Education and Knowledge is always a worthwhile investment."
2,"Strong technology, lousy support","Considering how much talent Adobe puts into product development, it amazes me how user-hostile their service is. I bought CS2 last week and cannot get Adobe Bridge to start. This is a critical problem since Canon RAW files (.CR2) from my 20D are not visible in the File/Open box. My fiancee spent three hours on the phone to Seattle today to try to get help, and when she finally got through, they wouldn't deal with her since she was not the registered user, even though she had the licence information. There is no information on Adobe's site regarding Bridge bugs. I don't know if this is also a problem on the Mac, but if you are an XP user, HOLD OFF ON CS2 until Adobe fixes the production bugs in its Bridge software, and gets a better handle on both its arrogance and quality control."
2,Going back to Photoshop 7,"PS CS2 is a pain in the behind to install and activate (which you have to do via the web or telephone).But even beyond install & activate, it needs 222MB of hard drive space (versus the 136MB that PS7 uses), takes about a minute or so to open on my computer (Windows 2000, 260MB RAM, 18GB hard drive), and then uses a boatload of memory once it's running. Forget about trying to use another high-memory program at the same time you're using PS2.I'm going back to using version 7. CS2 has a few more features than 7, but its memory usage is unacceptable for me.And Photoshop CS2 literally took about TEN MINUTES to UNinstall."
4,Short on RAW file support,"Granted photoshop is the standard for digital photo imaging but cs2 and previous versions may not support your (or my) camera's RAW files. Presumably that is because of the number of new DSLRs on the market and a lack of standardization of RAW file formats. The dng patch from Adobe didn't resolve the situation. However, the cs3 version does support more RAW file formats (incuding my camera's!). So do your homework. Check Adobe's web site to see if your camera's RAW files are supported, or take advantage of their free software trial. In the end, although I needed to upgrade to cs3, my purchase of cs2 followed by the upgrade to cs3 was still a cost savings over buying the full version of cs3."
1,It looked good but was pirated. Also had a virus on the CD,I could not activate it and Adobe told me there were a lot of good looking but pirated copies out there.The vendor credited my money immediately.
3,Complex,I need to take a class to figure out how to use this. I use the manual but it makes me even more lost.It has amazing capability...but not for the hobbiest without some real instruction.
4,"Great program, but steep learning curve","This is a great program to use for anyone looking for a more enhanced version of MS Paint. It has tons of features, and any well-trained user can really use PS to its true max. The program does take a bit of time to learn however, just not to know what the different tools are, but to use each one to see what they do, and the knowledge of when to apply them. I use it often, from basic photo editing, screen captures, full-art (I use it for Deviantart and stuff) and just fun. I've been using it for a while and still basically a novice, so that should give you an idea of how powerful it is. However, the price holds many people back, but any person with a bit of internet experience can find cheaper versions. Great progam all-in-all."
3,the swiss army knife of photo software,"Trys to do everything, not very gracefully, not the least intuitively, and sometimes not even very well, a massive resource hog, overkill for many photographers."
3,Surrealistic Madness,"A tragedy of physically becoming blind spread from a girl to parents of her, transforming into a social disaster of family falling apart as nothing joint them further.It is a very strange modernist work to enjoy at least for watering money down a sink that what is a definitely non-Austrian hobbit and a sure sign of a madness locally."
4,Very good for the price.,I used these lights with a Leviton motion detector and a photocell to add 2 security light fixtures along the back side of my garage. They have worked out great and for cheaper than an equal quality single fixture from the local hardware store.
5,The best helocoper ever!,i saw this toy in a kb toys and new i had to get it! at that time it was 30after 3 month i saved enough to buy it but then the kb toys closed for ever and i did not no wat to do! then my mom told me about amoson . com where it was alot less money of corse siping and handing made it more money but dat was okay because it still was less tan 30 a wek later i got my helocoper in a box this made it evan more fun my mom tod me that was becas of siping and handing ilike siping and handing now dank you amoson . com from josh i am five
1,it was part of an antler......,"it was bone.....just, a mid-section. a large diameter antler with a flush cut on either end. i guess its my fault....i should have assumed."
5,Really works,"Simple, non-toxic (to people), really heals hands. Much less greasy than hand creams, petrolatum, etc. The only caution is to wash hands well before handing pet birds (contains zinc, birds are sensitive to this)."
4,Good VCR for the price.,"Easy to connect and the stereo sound is great! The picture is clear, too. Slow motion and still are very, very clear. You can even record SAP if you speak Spanish and the TV show you're watching supports it. The only problem I've found is that sometimes, with older tapes, when you record a show you may get a little crackling in the sound. I suspect this is because the VCR's HI-FI sound is very sensitive. If you use a good brand of tape, like TDK and Maxell, you can limit this problem. Definately worth the money, especially for a stereo VCR."
2,"When it works, it's great......","Within 2 weeks of purchase, this VCR began to 'reject' tapes it didn't like. I thought at first it was because the tapes were old or of poor quality, so I threw a lot of them away and bought new, higher-quality tapes. But then it began to happen with brand new tapes. I'd put the tape in, it'd spit them right back out. Now, after a year, EVERY tape I put in gets ejected at least 4 or 5 times before it will play. Many won't play at all. I'd give this unit less stars, but it does do very well if I can ever get the...tape in to begin with!"
1,horrible!,"The VCR does have alot of features but what good is it if the picture and audio are horrible? I bought this VCR about a year ago and have yet to enjoy a tape. Recording quality and playback both have problems with constant ""snow"" in the picture and static in the audio. I'd recommend steering clear of this product!"
2,Noisy,I only used mine five minutes and decided it was too noisy. Traded it in for a different model.
4,The Picture looks good,"Thigs always look pretty good when you are looking at a picture of it, but seeing it and being able to really look it over and see the specifics of it, are two different stories."
2,"Worked OK for 4 years, now no picture, just audio","It wasn't a great VCR, but it did work, for 4 years. Only 4 years. One day, today, it stopped showing the video. You could hear the audio, but no video. Everything the other folks are saying about this thing is true: it's noisy rewind and fast forward. I thought my previous VCR, a Hitachi, didn't last long when it died after 9 years. 4 years is ridiculous. Stay away from Panasonic."
2,A disappointment,"I bought this VCR a few months ago when my Goldstar VCR of many years finally gave up the ghost. The price seemed right, and I thought Panasonic was reliable. However, while playing tapes I always seem to hear what sounds like the faint hum of a vacuum cleaner. The noise is distracting. It doesn't have a superfast FF play feature like my old VCR had, and I miss it. Also, I've suddenly lost picture quality and the VCR is telling me that I need to insert a head cleaner. I haven't used old or poor quality tapes and shouldn't have to use a head cleaner so soon after purchase. I really wish I could find another Goldstar."
2,Programming is very time consuming,"I don't care for the programming procedure on Panasonic. Each entry must be completed from scratch (no memory of recent entries, including today's date), but worst of all is that you can't enter the time directly, nor is a logical selection offered: you have to press the button for each day until you get to the day you want, then press the button until you reach the hour, then press the button until you reach the minute - you get the idea. The same is true for setting the channel.I returned it and found an RCA on sale. I've had Panasonic VCRs before, but I won't forget again."
4,No VCR Plus,Contrary to one of the other reviews on this product - it does not have VCR Plus programming.
3,"functional, but rickety and not sturdy","Wouldn't hold up heavy books, single sheets of paper slip off easily, and I'm afraid I'm going to break it every time I use it. But it works for a light, highly portable music stand."
3,music stand,Music stand is slightly crooked and missing a rubber grip on a page holder of the stand. Otherwise adjustments of stand are great and it works out for my home use for practice playing.
4,Works well,"Nice and compact. Folds up nice so portability factor comes in handy. it does tilt unevenly if you have havier material such as a music binder or say a book such as the Arbans trumpet study on it. Otherwise, works well."
1,Not so good,"I got this stand for my little kid who plays guitar. The lower part of the stand is fine but the part that holds the music book is really cheep. The book will fall off and hit the ground during the song! It doesnt get much worse than that. This stand was such a distraction to my kid we had to get rid of it.The only reason I gave it 1 star is because the lower 'teloscoping"" part seems to do a good job and it doesnt tip over.I would not recomend this stand even if it were free. It's really that bad!jm"
3,Flimsy,"I have to agree with those who said this stand was too flimsy to be useful. I play with a group, and we use two music books, one a spiral bound less than an inch thick and the other a 1"" looseleaf binder. This stand won't hold both at the same time. It is light weight and goes up easily and would probably be fine for a couple of pages of music. It fits nicely in the carrying case. The clasps would probably hold sheet music in place if you were outdoors, but the stand would be unstable on other than a paved surface."
3,Convenient but not well made,"Stand is nice since its one piece all connected together, and seems like a decent concept; however, the bag is slightly too small to be able to actually close it with the stand inside, and the construction of the stand is very flimsy. Music page holder tabs are already loose and flopping around, and not sure how long the plastic knobs will hold up. Wouldn't recommend."
5,Great stand!,"Great little stand, came quickly, is perfect for my 9 year old for violin practice! great adjustable height and wide stand for books and music."
3,Functional but flimsy,"For the price, this stand does the job. The stand itself is, however, rather flimsy. The metal components are thin and pliable and will bend easily with enough pressure. The legs work well and allow the stand to stay upright when used; the page clasps are also functional but extremely flimsy. The height can be adjusted by knobs that tighten against the central pillar--again, functional but flimsy (a little pressure will force the pillar down).The carry / storage bag is a cheap add-on with a small velcro square. It's the bare minimum for storing or carrying the stand. A good tug would easily rip / tear the bag and the handle--handle with care.Overall, the stand is serviceable and cheap. It should work fine, but I'd be concerned about durability for younger musicians--or if the stand is used / stored in an area with traffic."
2,comment,The Quality was bad. Some parts were bent.The material is cheap.I don't suggest you to buy this item.
5,love it,"Well made, easy to use, sturdy. The 2 parts stay together , making it easy to not lose one or the other, which is what happened to my old stand.The case makes it a snap to carry with all the music and instruments."
4,music stand,"this item is so easy to carry and very helpful. I enjoy using it for all my music sheets, specially I don't have to put my music sheets on the bed or on the table anymore when I practice."
5,Exceptional Value,"I got this for my 12 year old daughter who plays the flute in the school concert band. This was easy for her to set up and pack up. She had no trouble with it and seemed to stand up to her constant assembling and dismantling of the stand to take with her to her practice and concerts. My only disappointment with it is that after a month fof purchasing the stand, Amazon has it for $5 less than what I had paid."
3,Not bad,"The stand works alright. It is difficult for a younger student (age 9) to tighten and untighten the bolts to set the stand up so that it is sturdy enough to use. Also, one of the legs bent the first time it was set up. I could easily bend it back, but it was completely unexpected. It's OK."
4,Sturdy. Great page holder feature! Lots of adjustability.,"Great stand which can be adjusted for standing or sitting use. What I really love is the little page holders and page extension ""wings"" for when you use horizontal format music books, like the Mel Bay guitar book my son is using. Sturdy construction that should last."
2,Difficult to fold,"It is functional as a music stand, but very difficult to fold / unfold for travel. I wouldn't buy another one"
1,Flimsy and very poor manufacturing quality,"The manufacturer did not drill some of the holes so it's impossible to tighten the screws, and other holes have huge burrs on the inside which require filing to insert the smaller section into the large tube section. I returned it."
5,Very nice travel stand,"It's light, has nice rubber tips on the feet, has leg braces, folds up into a nice small package, has a carry bag, and easily adjusts to use either standing or sitting, with TWO height adjusters so you can make it really low, or extra high. It has the traditional ""wind wires"" on the tray, but more importantly has ""wings"" on each upper corner that can be used to support extra size pages, or pulled around to be retaining clips. I've owned two other folding music stands and neither was even close to this one in either functionality or quality of construction."
2,Not the one,"I found it to be flimsy, fiddly, and awkwardly designed, with a poorly made case that's a little too small. Unless you really need adjustable tilt, the Hamilton folding stand that's been around for 50+ years is far superior, has the same (limited) capacity, and is about the same size and weight.If compact portability is not a requirement, you can't beat the non-foldingManhasset M48 Symphony Music Standwhich also has been around forever. Much sturdier, can hold a lot more weight, with a tilting mechanism that is simpler, easier to use, and far stronger."
1,Poor Quality,"We ordered this since our 2 kids in band were sharing a stand. We thought it would be a quality product for their practice time at home. When we set it up the first time, the screws that tighten the stem parts would not tighten, so the stand would not stay at the correct height. Did not seem to be made well at all. Returned for refund."
5,Fantastic product,"This inexpensive portable music stand fits my requirements perfectly. It's MUCH sturdier than the old style two piece silver ones. Here are the features I love.* The angle of the music holder adjusts to any angle.* It folds down small.* I love the color (black), which fits in with all my other gear.* I received it very quickly.* I use it every day....bringing it to rehearsals or at home in the practice room.* It's ONE PIECE...so if you are carrying without the bag, you are not dropping one piece or the other.My only complaint is the handle on the bag. It's too small to use around your arm or shoulder, but too big to use as a proper handle in the hand. It is not really centered or balanced for easy carrying. If you improve that you'll get SIX stars from me!"
4,"Decent, does the job","5'9"" it's a decent height if I put it almost as high as it can go. (If I go to the max height it will be unsteady and useless). The head portion is bigger than most usual stands in terms of it being more of a rectangle than the usual folding music stand so the music sheets on it stay steadier. Also the page ""clips"" have a spring on them as well as a pivot to make them more maneuverable.Generally if you need a cheap music stand that does the job and are about my height or shorter then go for it. I think that past 5'!!"" it wouldn't make sense unless you're planning to be in the seated position perpetually."
3,It's OK for the money,The stand serves it's purpose for the price. It has a nice construction and design but it is kind of flimsy. The bag it came in ripped as soon as it was opened. The Velcro came completely off but we were able to resew it on.
2,"Ok, but flimsy","The stand is ok for what I paid, but it's really flimsy, wobbly, and easy to break.Had I understood that before buying, I would have bought a better model."
1,Not functional,The stand is not even functional. The screws are not working. The quality of the stand is so low and fragile! It is not even worth the money!!!
2,Hard to assemble/disassemble,"The stand is very light and folds to a very convenient size but is quite difficult to assemble and disassemble with very tight joints. Because of these joints, the black paint also comes off and it makes the stand unsightly."
2,Not new!,"The stand seems to work fine but the bag it came in is not new. The stand did not come in ""new"" condition. There is white marks all over the ""new"" black bag. I'm not happy with the condition at all."
3,"Great size, great picture, but...",The VCR part quit working less than one year after purchase. TV works just fine...
3,Okay but makes buzzing sound.,I've been using this product for quite a while and never had a problem.Cons: Makes a buzzing sound.
5,Great Service,I received this product in about three days. I am very happy with the Surge Protector and the quick srevice.
4,Great watch. Nice band but too short!,It is my favorite watch. I love the simple styling and readable face. Very sturdy - great for active lifestyles. Just wish the green fabric watch band was an inch longer . It is sized for asian wrists. Highly recommended.
1,Not leather,Just be aware if you order from this listing or if you are selling from this listing that the description in the title does not even fit an edition of the UBS 4 Greek New Testament. It does come in leather and the listed ISBN matches that but if it has a dictionary it will not be leather as this was not printed. If you are selling a copy of this please be sure to match the ISBN on the cover page to the four digit code on the back of the cover (for the leather edition this is 5111).And to be clear I was not disappointed with the seller as much as with how Amazon allows this to be listed. Be sure you are ordering what you want before hitting buy.
4,Lexicon?,"My Greek professor chose this version for class use. It's good that has English prolegomenon (introduction) so you don't get easily lost. Just make sure your version includes lexicon, because I've assumed they all had it then just found out there are two different versions, with and without lexicon."
1,Important Variant Readings Missing,"The apparatus of this edition lacks all variant readings which are important for someone interested in stylistic problems. The codex Alexandrinus on which this edition is heavily based is very much an atticised version of the New Testament. However, there are many manuscripts that are written in a more koine style. Like all the UBS editions this edition underestimates the importance of philological research as has been done, for instance, by Sturz and other philogists. Of course, style has never been a preoccupation of students of christianity."
5,Whose going to say anything negative?,"Well, after all, it IS the New Testament! Who can review negatively?? But, still, I think this is a nice edition. I liked the introduction, which was clear and informative, and I like the footnotes, which are a big help.The inclusion of a dictionary in the back is wonderful (this is a Koine Greek edition). Previously, I had to juggle a couple of books. I've always had a problem with being too compulsive (look up meaning, even when I already know it, just in case there is a nuance I might miss). But, somehow, having the dictionary right there, has freed me from some of the constant word searching.I like the size of the text, itself, too. It is very readable, and pleasant."
2,Not what it sounds like,"For those who are studying homiletics, this is NOT a book on how to apply homiletics. It's a book on how you should preach certain subjects, and it's very tedious. The old-fashioned thinking, that the homilist has to be the protector of the innocent and clueless, ""ignorant faithful"" was appropriate to his time, but is outdated now."
1,Spray Has NO effect,"Bought this for my Maltese who shivers, pants and gets glassy eyed when riding in a car. Package came torn and crushed, some of spray had leaked out. Used more than called for on her car bed on four separate trips both going and returning. It didn't work at all. What a waste of money!"
3,product came very quickly,"Product was shipped very quickly, but the product does not seem to work for my dog."
1,Not even an ounce of change in my Yorkie,"I realize this has worked for others, but it hasn't made a difference in my Yorkie. She still gets upset on car rides. I spray her traveling bag every time a few minutes prior to leaving. I've been doing this nearly every time since receiving the spray and no change."
1,didn't work,i got this for my yorkie. he gets nervous during t-storms which are a normal occurrence here. he also gets nervous during the first couple of minutes when he's in his kennel. this didn't help at all
3,this didn't seem to work,"I've used the plug in with much success on my first dog, so i thought this would be great as we were traveling to my parents house so i thought it'd help our new dog settle down... however, this did nothing at all... she was still scared.. maybe the spray just doesn't work as well as the plug in? or maybe it just has no effect on my second dog? Either way, I don't think I'd recommend the spray again. I'd def say the plug in worked, though!"
2,Supposed to be the best.....,But had no noticeable affect on my Fur Boys behavior. I was desperate to try & make him comfortable riding in the car. seems only riding in it for hours was the answer. Perhaps the Doggy Downers I bought may have helped. Actually a heavy plastic seatcover would have been a more usefull purchase. Maybe it'll work for you. Do you feel lucky-well do ya?
2,Did not work,Did not really do anything for our dog..ended up getting a thunder jacket which seems to help a bit. It may work for your dog as I am sure not all dogs respond the same.
3,Works for some - NOT for others,"My vet told me about this spray and warned me that it works for only 40-60% of dogs - and doesn't work for others. Before I bought this product, I bought my dog a ""calming collar"" with pheromones and lavender. It seemed to work okay. However, the spray doesn't seem to work at all (at least for my dog). I'm going to to stick with the collar from now on."
1,Didn't work,"Bought this for a lab that I rescued which had a lot of anxiety issues (separation anxiety, pacing the house for hours, refusing to lay down and rest, following us from room to room, crying when he would see another dog). The DAP didn't seem to work at all.We recently put him on a prescription anti-depressant (Clomicalm) and it is a complete 180* change within 2 weeks. He is much more relaxed, sociable, and fun.DAP is worth a shot but if it doesn't work I definitely recommend trying a more aggressive option (Clomicalm)."
5,Worth every single cent!!!!!,"I replaced my entire HVAC system a few weeks ago. After the work was completed, my 3 1/2 year old Shiba Inu was completely anxiety stricken because of the new noises the unit was making. He stopped eating, was hiding under the bed on a regular basis and jumped at every noise he heard. The other night he started shaking + trembling very badly and I knew I had to do something fast. Someone suggested this product and I immediately bought it. I plugged the unit in and INSTANTLY noticed a difference. My Shiba sniffed the air, jumped ON the bed (didn't go under it) and slept for 3 hours straight.This morning, he went downstairs and ate his food without having to be coaxed. You definitely can see a huge change in his entire demeanor.I highly recommend this product for anxiety stricken dogs. It's truly an amazing product."
4,dap dog pheromone,I tried this product it has helped with my dogs licking. He has slacked off a little.
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your $$ on this product. We got it for our dog who whines/barks in the car in her kennel but it is useless.
2,My dog didn't seem to notice,"I bought this for my 1 year old Westie who I am trying to crate train. He will bark and whine non-stop while in his kennel, so I bought this hoping it would help. I used it several times and he doesn't seem to notice the difference. I also tried using it on his bed and on a blanket, and nothing. Might work for other dogs, but not mine."
1,didn't work,We bought this product to help keep our dog calm after spaying surgery.Didn't work at all....very disappointed.
2,Dog Appeasing Spray,"I bought this product as a last resort effort to help my girl with her crate and seperation anxiety. I did not see any change in her behavior and it has not helped my situation. I did have a foster dog for a weekend and she was very happy to go into the open crate and sleep. ( it had been sprayed with D.A.P. ) But I don't know if that had anything to do with the spray. I will continue to use the spray with the hopes that it will eventually help. I don't know if it does or doesn't work, it just didn't work for me. ( so far )"
1,Didn't work for our dog,"I had high hopes that this spray would work, but our dog didn't seem to notice it at all. Still barked, scratched in his kennel for 40 minutes while I practiced going in and out of the house."
1,Dog calming spray,This product has not worked as well as I thought it would.I would not get it again.it could be the breed of dog she is a lab
3,So So,"Worked great in the beginning, but now not as much. Still helps and is FAR better than drugging him, I just wish it were a little more effective."
1,Didn't work for us,"Unfortunately, this product did nothing to alleviate anxiety in my dog. That being said, all dogs (and their anxieties) are not created equal.. It may work for you and yours. My neighbor uses this with great success. When searching for a solution (and btw.. a simple spray is rarely the aha fix all), it is certainly worth a try."
2,dog anxiety,"this product may work on some dogs ( my little papillion drooled), but my pug terrier had no reaction to it. she may need puppy prozac. in any case, i am neutral as neither dog got the desired effect from it."
4,From The Top,"Dear Evree Won,Out of all the AGE OF APOCALYPSE stories this has to been the most emotionaly charged. It shows the hardship of this new world without Charles Xavier and that death is far from taken lightly. My favorite characters in this story are Jonathan ""Chamber"" Starsmore and Paige ""Husk"" Guthrie because their personalities are the furthest away from the ""real"" reality.The least you could do is smile, PaulQ"
4,"great computer for home,bad for traveling","As you can see its a great computer the only flaw really is that it dont burn dvd's, Great for watching movies by your self or with a friend, it has pretty loud speakers so you could also play music pretty loud,it is adjustable so if your with 2 friends and they always talk you could put your headphones on and they could listen to it through the speakers on the computer. Its good for games and yes you can get a full screen with games you just have to set it right. It can store a lot of music kinda like having an mp3 player in your room(now for the flaws) but if you are limited a real small space its kinda hard to store it all the time, its not wireless unless you get a card and a wirless modem, for it being its size it should be thinner and you cant hook up your ps2 or your game cube to it. but if these flaws dont obtain to you its a great computer to have remember you can always add on to it with external drives"
3,there you are,"i'm a fan. thought it was the whole cd, but i did buy the cd. and i love it have'nt taken it out of my cd player yet."
5,This guy is fantastic if you enjoy getting in the mood with,The music itself sends you in an orbit to find love. It places you on your mate. Great theme.
2,Gave my daughter painful gas,"I'm pumping at work and looked for a product to increase or maintain milk production. I started drinking this tea and thought perhaps it was working. It had a decent taste once I added the sugar. Unfortunately I noticed that my daughter started having really painful gas at night when I nursed at home. I couldn't figure out what had changed til I recalled the other reviews of this product. I stopped drinking the tea and her painful gas stopped. oh well, it was worth a shot!"
5,Yummy and effective,"When I use this tea my breastmilk increased dramatically, wish I could purchase more and it does not taste bad!"
5,Excellent,This product increased my milk supply by 2.5 times. Which shortend the amount of time I had to spend nursing by half! Tastes pretty good too. I added honey to help cover the anise that I don't care for.
4,Excellent but needs updating.,"I would highly recommend this book except that it is outdated. Found a few errors, but I loved it otherwise. Hope the author has an updated version. The activities make learning fun."
3,Standard Mason,"The Swallow was typical Gardner with a nicely complex plot with the identity of the ""bad guy"" shifting more than once. But still a routine read. The other pulp stories included were just too dated to be of interest."
4,Color is a Bit Strong,"Tabs is a very nice looking Beanie baby cat. The only thing I dislike is the color is a bit loud, but my son has an orange tabby cat in real life, so he loves it anyway. It's very soft and a bit smushy, but that's a good thing."
4,Don't trust the naysayers,"When the 3-chord flash bands of today are still filling arenas in 30 years, THEN we'll talk.Geddy and the boys can still run circles around most of the musicians 40 years their junior.Long Live Rush. Another great album."
4,I like this monkey business!,"Snakes & Arrows is a far superior album to Vapor Trails. I like Vapor Trails, but it has too dense a sound and as many have said, the individual instruments are lost and indistinct. S&A is dense, but at the same time the individual instruments are heard again. I LIKE this album! The best track is the Main Monkey Business- an instrumental that to me sounds like Rush of the 80's. I also like Far Cry, Armor and Sword, The Larger Bowl (a different song for Rush, but very well executed!), Hope, Malignant Narcissism, and the closer- We Hold On- is a great way to finish the album! I have tickets to see them in concert in July and can't wait to hear the aboe mentioned songs live. I'm not impressed with Bravest Face, the one track that I don't really like. Not that it's a bad song- it just doesn't do much for me. Oer all a very worthy album from Rush. Now if they would just redo Vapor Trails- if only for Earthshine and Ghostrider!"
4,"Intelligent, and it rocks too!","Some of the reviews here are very nostalgic for old Rush, really old Rush. I got into them during the Roll the Bones era, and not being very aware in their early days (seeing as I either wasn't alive or was very wee) I look back at the older stuff and think ""some of it rocks, some is quite silly"". This is a very good album and not at all silly or pretentious. The lyrics are intelligent and thoughtful, in a way that Roll the Bones was. And the music rocks. I just saw this album played live in concert and it was awesome. I am looking forward to more stuff like this!"
5,Unique format,"Fantastic format, giving the buyer a unique perspective on the production of the band's latest studio material. The ""behind the scenes"" video was truly entertaining. One should be cautioned, however, that this format cannot be played in a standard CD player."
5,Master Musicians,"A wicked comeback for Rush in the '00s. They are officially back with a tight performance. Excellent guitar sounds and layering are found throughout 'Snakes and Arrows' with often hypnotic vocal melodies.You don't have to know anything about music to recognize the Hemispheres chord on track 1. With the next 3 songs, I get a strange but intriguing hook vibe found only on early 80's album 'Signals'. Also note there is a brilliant acoustic guitar short piece ""Hope"".A lacking blues jam intro and oblique chorus hooks grouped later on 'Snakes and Arrows' don't represent old rush or new. This is one of many reasons why I would not rank this in the top 5 best Rush ever.But to end on a positive note, I'm am totally surprised these guys still have their hearing and abilities with nearly 20 studio albums and decades of touring. They have not lost their chops one bit!"
5,MVI is worth it!,"This CD is not much more expensive than a regular one and the extra stuff is totally worth it! The behind the scenes stuff alone was worth the buy. Transferring to your computer is a breeze and with everyone having MP3 players anyway, it's in the perfect format. The sound is great. If they keep making these cd's, I will keep buying!"
3,Nothing too innovative here,"Rush has been one of my favorite bans for years. In fact, I'll be seeing them for my fifth time in concert next month for their tour supporting Snakes and Arrows. All I can say is I hope they don't play too mmuch of this ""new"" material.Rush is still one of the best bands out there, but their music is getting less and less inspiring with each new release. This album just feels that is was released for monetary gain.If you're new to Rush, start with some of the older, more inspiired material."
2,Could have been better,"After the disappointment of Vapor Trails, I was hoping for improvement. Let me start by saying I first saw Rush as a backup band to Kiss in 1974. I have seen them more than a dozen times since. They are probably one of the best live bands ever. Snakes and Arrows does not do them justice. On the first listen, you have trouble distinguishing between the songs. After a few times through you begin to hear the nuances and distinctions. It is definitely better than Vapor Trails but a far cry from their earlier work. There seems to be a dark side to this CD and it left me feeling kinda depressed after listening to it. Long time Rush fans will probably like it, but you have to give it a long listen and then decide."
4,Vapor Trails meets Counterparts....,"This is for the Rush fan only. If you are a Rush fan, then you must have it, because it is a very good album. It's like a mix between Vapor Trails and Counterparts, but of course has its own sound.The stand outs are as following:5 stars:Faithless, Armor & Sword, Workin' Them Angels, and Good News First4 stars:Far Cry, The Larger Bowl (A Pantoum), The Main Monkey Business, and The Way the Wind Blows.3 stars: Spindrift, Hope, Bravest Face, Malignant Narcism, We Hold On.This album has a lot of 3 star songs IMO, which kind of drags it down unlike other Rush albums, which are loaded with 4 and 5 star songs.If you are not a Rush fan, start with Moving Pictures, 2112, Power Windows or Roll the Bones."
3,Great single Bad CD,I heard Farcry and was very excited for this release. It seemed like Rush had gone back to counterparts era and was ready to explode. After the first single though this cd starts to fall off greatly. The band who has always had songs about hope comes across as grumpy man who hate everything. Armor and sword never gets going and Faithless falls flat. The Larger bowel is awesome but lacks the cleaverness of Half off of Test for echo. Rush fans can be very spirited (LoL) about bad reviews but I just know there is another Counterparts or Test for Echo or Moving pictures in them but this is back to back bad cds. Still better than vapor trails so they got that going for them. As for the instrumentals nothing grabbed me like Limbo off Test.
4,solid outing,"I'm a Rush fan and for me this was a good solid cd, but not the best.Its well worth the money and has some great moments.... support your favorite artists."
4,Really good!,"For someone (me) who is stuck on the hey day Rush (2112-MP) I am very happy with this CD. This reminds me of when Counterparts came out - I liked that as a stand alone CD not compared to old rush. The songs are catchy and deep and the production is fantastic. My ONLY complaint is that there is almost no odd meter which Rush does so tastefully (that's just me). That aside, some new stuff that I liked was the slightly bluesier guitar sounds. In fact the guitar sounds are amazing through out. The bass and drums sound perfect too.I have everything Rush ever did and will stick with them until either I or them are through. But I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes great songs with great production. Get it."
4,Good effort from a band of many transitions.,"I realized that Rush cd's these days take several listens. The band has always been very complex and you sometimes have to get through the many layers to hear to the final product. To me not every Rush album gets five stars. The band definetly has evolved over the years and thats a good thing. What matters is this band has always had a lot of heart in their music and thats very important these days. One thing I did find interesting on this cd was three instrumentals. To the surprise of most people I found ""Vapor Trails"" to be one of their best cd's. All in all this is good effort."
4,A satisfying peek inside the recording life of Rush,"Since I'd already bought the album, I made this purchase solely for the DVD - and it was worth every cent. I'm a new Rush fan - Snakes & Arrows was my first album & first concert - and I'm hooked. This DVD was a deeply satisfying and inspiring peek into the recording style, habits, relationships, and philosophies that make Rush who and what they are. A must!"
2,Bring back Terry Brown!,"This album is too layered, too processed sounding, too compressed, etc. The producer needs to go. Bring back the famed producer of Rush's earlier work Terry Brown. His albums had a clean crisp sound with instrumental separation and a great flow. This is one loud mush of sound. Bad stuff. Forget the writing, it may be good, you can't tell the production is so overblown. Digital ear splitting garbage."
2,I tried and tried and tried...,"..to like this, I really did. These guys are truly great but there are just very few real songs here. The playing is impeccable and I like the intstrumentals, but where is the melody? The best Rush tunes at least had some semblance of melody, but now that Geddy sings with little of the range he once had, the vocal lines are just straight and flat.50 percent of this is pretty good, the other half, well, it's boring."
1,Uninspired,"Sadly this is just more of the same uninspired and predictible music that plagued their last studio album. What happened to the brilliant orchestrations that characterized Rush music for such great works as Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, Roll the Bones and Counterparts?It seems like the Canadian power trio has devolved into a self indulgent formula. None of these tracks really seem to stand out. I honestly felt like I was listening to the same song through the entire album.Rush really needs a creative producer to bring out their best. A producer to challenge their writing skills and push them to orchestrate their sound...A producer to save them from themselves. Unfortunately, Nick Raskulinecz couldn't accomplish this."
2,A Bore,"The past 5 or 6 years have been a time of growth and experimentation for Rush after their hiatus in the late 90s. But it has also been a time of reflection, thought, and utmost simplicity in their music. I have been a Rush fan for about 5 years and I own nearly all of their studio recordings and all of their DVD releases. So I know Rush's sound pretty well now.Snakes & Arrowsis just a disapointment to me. For me, it sounds likeTest for EchoII--it has 1 to 3 tracks that are actually good and the rest are just filler material or very mellow acoustic tracks. The only song I like here is ""Far Cry"" and besides that SNAKES is just a sleepy, monotonous album--at least for Rush. Sadly, I do not think that Rush will ever be able to compose as well as they did before theCounterpartsalbum. Yet, I congratulate Rush for trying as hard as they could to produce the kind of top-notch music that they were playing during the 70s and 80s. I can't wait to see Rush on tour this summer, though!"
1,Where'd my favorite band go?,"I own 5 pairs of Adidas flip-flop sandals. ANY ONE of them has more ""soul"" than this album."
3,"This record didn't stir my spirit, but I can't hate it...","I purchased this record via iTunes on May 5th of 2007. I went for one of my lengthy bike rides and brought the iPod along to listen to this record on the same day. I didn't find anything offensive about it upon the initial listen. I will give Messrs. Weinrib, Zivojinovich and Peart credit for being able to bring a certain degree of rock at their age. BUT...........................there is a triteness to the lyrics. Witness ""No one gets to heaven without a fight""...""...spirit...strong...flesh is too weak""......yeah, Neil. yadda yadda yadda. We all know that crap.Basically my reaction to and evaluation of this record is ""So wart?"""
4,Evolving,"I have been a Rush fan since they first appeared on the scene. No band had had the guts to update, change, be progressive in their style and format as Rush. I would venture to say this band does not progress, they evolve. Every new album is an exploration forward. Every new album moves the limits of progressive rock forward. This is a great Rush album which takes us in a new direction (an acoustic foundation), but still, when you close your eyes, you know it is Rush. The best lyricist in the business (Neal Peart) is on his game and familiar themes appear, i.e. working your way through life... There is a reason Rush is one of my favorite bands of all time, Snakes & Arrows does not change that notion."
3,mixed feelings,"There are definitely some nice songs on this album, but there is too much overlay in chorus in Geddy's vocals. Neil Peart is great, but overall this album does not have the quality of the earlier Rush albums, like Hemispheres or Moving Pictures..."
1,disappointed-- been a fan since 1981,"These guys are rush, they do what they want. They've always done what they wanted. They had to have signed off on how bad this thing sounds. From the outset it is a barrage of sound that hides anything that could be signature for these guys. You have to strain to hear Alex's solo's...what??? Your Alex lifeson.. a guitar legend!!! Turn up your solo bud!!! Geddy has no precision to his sound. Its blended so well you can't hear any one element.. The same guy wrote the bass lines to red barchetta...ugh...Neils kick is somewhere in the mix but again blended to well who knows. No matter where I tweak this I can't get it to pump without something else sounding like crap. I listen to vinyl run through parametric eq then graphic then through sennheiser headphones. I can put the first rush album on (1974) and with a few tweaks I can make it sound MUCH, much better."
2,Expected more,"I won't pour bile over this record, but I'll say that it's definitely not as strong as some of their past efforts... Too bad, I really wanted to like this album - I have lost touch with Rush since ""Hold Your Fire"" (been a while) but I cannot. In my honest opinion, it's lacking direction and cohesiveness. It's not totally terrible, as some reviewers suggest, but far from ""amazing"" as many others insist."
5,Energetic!,"I'm (yikes!)41 y.o. and I've been to at least 2 shows every tour since the Signals album. I think this is their best work in 20 years. Really great tunes. Wonderful rock album. It's inspiring to me as a musician, and a fan!"
4,into grander territory,"a creative and mysterious offering that bespeaks volumes about the pain, suffering, love and joy that these journeymen have experienced through the years. They really are survivors in more ways than one, capturing the elusive nature of enlightenment, or the striving toward enlightenment. Rush has always been the thinking person's choice of rock, managing to powerfully activate so many sensations with their music: cognitive, rhythmic, mystical...multiple nerve centers stimulated.While they take us into newer and richer aural landscapes with each release, I still long for those single rockers that explode with energy. Perhaps I need to give this one a few more listens. It is growing on me in sinuously magical ways."
2,Snakepits and Sorrow!,"I actually borrowed this CD from a friend - I didn't want to throw my money away, I just needed to satisfy my curiousity. Smart decision. If Rush was unknown, and this was their first CD being played for the record execs, they would never get a recording contract. There's no substance here. Boring, mundane, uninspiring. I don't long for the ""OLD"" sound of Rush, I just hope that one day they recapture the MAGIC they once had. There's nothing wrong with changing your sound, you just can't be lazy and change it to junk. Too much filtering and electronics. Go back and listen to the blockbuster song ""Spirit of the radio"". The song was an enormous commercial success for many reasons. I'm not looking for another ""Spirit"", but I would like something equally bombastic for a change. I don't expect magic on every record, but once every couple of decades isn't really asking too much. Until that day comes, I've got very shallow pockets."
3,Not the best Rush album,"I own several Rush albums and this is the worst one I own. It has a few good tracks and a few not-so-good tracks. I especially like ""Far Cry."" I actually bought this album because I heard that song on the radio. Overall the instrumentals are put together nicely, and Geddy Lee still sounds like Geddy Lee. No doubt you'll like this album if you like Rush. If you don't like Rush, pick up ""Vapor Trails"", ""2112"", or ""Hold Your Fire"". You will like Rush after those albums and you'll come back later for this one."
3,Good album,"I have owned every one of Rush's cd's- I liked this more than Test For Echo and Vapor Trails but not as much as others.Some very very good songs (the instrumentals and leading track ""Far Cry"") but others I don't care for at all."
3,"3 stars, and I'm being generous","I've been a Rush fan since Permanent Waves. What I like most about them is that their music is unpredictable and that they continue to be thoughtful in their lyrics, in a world where pop music is simply rhyme to a beat, Rush continues to say something in their music.Not on Snakes and Arrows, though. I found the music dull and predictable. Good lyrics, but they didn't really speak to me, let alone move me.Glad to have the guys back for more, and it's a great improvement over Vapor Trails, but it does little for me."
2,Rush gets a free pass,"This, unfortunatly, is the first Rush review that I have written. Unfortunatly this album really has no memerable songs on it at all. Although the muscianship is there, the songs are extremely flat and lifeless. Though the acoustic and instrumentals do stand out and the writing (thanks to that genius Neil Peart) do shed some light, this album does not stand up to previous albums. Some of the album sounds like rehashes of their earlier stuff. They suprisingly are not breaking new ground here. I do understand that Rush have been together for thirty plus years. They are allowed to make a sub par album for once in that time span. So, they get a free pass from me."
3,"Poorly mastered, passable material","I mean, I'll always buy a Rush album, I guess, just out of loyalty to my own youth as much as to the band itself. But this CD is as squashed as Vapor Trails was, without being quite as musically compelling (One Little Victory? Genius I tell you.) Fire the limiter-happy mastering engineers, and write some more cool songs."
2,I Just Don't Get The Modern RUSH,"Concerning RUSH's last three studio recordings, Test For Echo, Vapor Trails and Snakes & Arrows ..... I just don't get it. It all sounds like a bunch of noise to me. Counterparts is the last recording I really liked by them overall ..... I guess that makes me a classic RUSH fan only at this point in time. The only reason I gave this recording two stars was out of the respect for the great musicians they are and the outstanding live shows they still perform today."
3,Not Bad-Not Memorable,"Most of the new CD is good the music is awesome, but the they are forcing melody to an unmusical and unworkable lyric set, like a lot of country music. Vapor Trails sound with extras. At least on VT Earthshines grabs you. I haven't found anything similar on this one. Having read Ghost Riders, VT comes in as a my 3rd favorite. Hemispheres is 1st then Moving Pictures."
2,Bland from a great Band,"As they say, best not to get your hopes up. And that's certainly true with this latest CD from Rush. Being a Rush fan from back in the mid-1970s, I was eagerly waiting for this new album. Perhaps too eagerly. When I finally got my hands on it last week, I found I was underwhelmed.It's a bland, boring album. Not one of the tracks stands out as something extraordinary, or even good enough for a Rush song. And this was supposed to be a return to the ""classic sound"" of the Band.I didn't like their previous album Vapor Trails because of the mixing and other things, but that is better than this new CD."
5,Incredible!,"Of course, all of these reviews for the CD are bogus. It's not even out yet. Reviews of the single are certainly legitimate. It's Rush, you either like them or you don't. What I find incredible is how some people have never moved beyond 2112. C'mon! It's 30 years ago! I bet those people still wear bell bottoms and have huge, bushy sideburns. You probably still use Hai Karate cologne and vote republican. Republican state of mind = change is bad. Change is not bad, it is what it is. Different. So, I guess you should drive home in your Vega, with your Pet Rock in the passenger seat. There you can fire up your Lava Lap, smoke out in your basement and listen to your 2112 8-track tape. Have a fun time!"
4,"Solid musically, masterful lyrics, MVI not what I expected","The MVI is not a bad thing - it offers many features the CD does not, including .mp3 DRM free and 5.1 audio, but the high resolution audio is not in DVD audio format, and simply plays back as down-sampled 44.1khz. For some reason, I expected music videos, though after a short review that was never mentioned.Snakes and Arrows is easily one of Rush's best and should be an automatic purchase for any Rush fan.Love it!"
4,BURNSY REWIEW,"EXCELLANT DVD, SUPERB EXTRAS, SOUND QUALITY WITH 5:1 SURROUND BEST I,VE HEARD BETTER THAN SACD AND DVD-A,IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT BEATS CD HANDS DOWN"
5,An excellent album!,Snakes and Arrows is one of those albums that you must listen to a few times before the genius of it truly hits you. A very nice offering from one of the greatest and most technical group of guys to have ever recorded music.
4,Awesome!!!,"I thought that Rush did a great job putting this CD together, it's like they've got a bit of their grove back. I have no regrets buying this CD and adding it to every CD they ever put out collection.James B."
3,Is Rush over the hill?,What? Rush has gone MELLOW on us? Is nothing sacred?This CD gets three stars entirely because Rush still writes great songs. And Neal Peart remains among the greatest drummers in rock and roll eternity. But there is way too much acoustic guitar and mellotron for my tastes. My first Rush album was the classic 2112. I have followed them ever since. Vapor Trails was a tremendous return to form. Snakes and Arrows sees Rush becoming almost elderly in comparison.Diehard Rush enthusiasts will love it. Everyone should take a listen first.
4,"Pretty good, but it takes a few listens","Just to let you know where this Rush fan is coming from, I thought ""Vapor Trails"" was below par. I'm also a fan of 80's Rush, right up to ""Roll The Bones."" I was under their spell and then......grunge happened. It seemed to knock Rush off track, trying to prove they could still rock hard. As a result, I enjoyed half of ""Counterparts"" and ""Test of Echo"" (made a great compilation btw) and then VT, so I was nervous about ""Snakes And Arrows."" Well, like many good albums, it doesn't necessarily grab you on first listen, but it is a grower. Also, I am very pleased to say that the recording quality and artwork are excellent. 3 1/2 stars."
5,"Rush latest, one of the better one's","All great songs, love the extra's on this MVI DVD, and the songs sound great in 5.1, can't wait to see the guys live."
3,Mixed Bag....,"I am a huge Rush fan, so I always look forward to seeing what they come up with next. This is an interesting and very different kind of Rush album. Their previous effort (Vapor Trails) was one of my favorite by them, this one remains down in the middle. There are some high points: Far Cry, The Larger Bowl, Spindrift, The Main Monkey Business. Out of the whole album, Far Cry and The Larger Bowl are what captivated me most, although Malignant Narcissism was testorone cool. That said it does not crack my top five (Moving Pictures, Permanent Waves, 2112, Counterparts, and Vapor Trails). There is an urgency that is missing in the album after Far Cry. This album reminds me more of 1989's Presto, very thoughtful, reflective but lacking the energy. I loved Peart lyrics on that album, but not the musical interpretation. Same with this one. That said, for any Rush head, this is a must and a chance to hear Alex play accoustic and get into Neil's head a little bit."
4,Best since signals!,"solid album From Rush....Not crazy about a lot of stuff they did, but Snake and arrows is a great one. Their best since signal IMO."
4,F The Critics,"If you're one of those ""fans"" who wishes Rush never moved away from their late 70's, early 80's sound, and can't understand why they don't write that kind of music/lyrics any more, why don't you go listen to those records, quit bitching, and let the rest of us enjoy the new stuff. It's 2007, so grow up...the band certainly has.This is a great disc, with its own unique sound and character. Sure, it's mostly mid-tempo stuff, but the songs grow on you quickly, and I personally feel this is one of their best discs in years. I can't wait to see them in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati this summer.Long Live Rush!"
5,Rush's sword is sharp again!,"I can not stop listening to track #2. Thats the one after the awesome sounding Farcry. I could remember the eagerness back in the 80s for Rush to relea-- I mean, unleash their next album. They just brought that qulaity and feeling back for me. What a great release. The decision to include 4 instrumentals was a great idea, at least for me, because I am a big Satriani and Enevoldson fan. The instrumentals play big and the other tunes play bigger. Rush is back, although, for me, I could always go back to Moving pictures and Signals and know that they are always still here and still powerful."
5,Back to their roots,First I would like to say that I have waited to give you a review of this album until I have actually heard it more than once unlike the others here. I must admit that it is a well written and performed piece of art. I appreciate that Rush has stuck to its roots and given us music comprised of bass guitar and drums and not too much of the '80 style of their music with keyboards dominating the music. It has gotten better with the second and third listen and I am now on the fourth time through. So please ignore the reviews that were submitted the first week that say this album is not good. It is fantastic so go out and buy it already!
2,Still Not Able To Get Back On Track:,"The last GREAT Rush album was ""Hold Your Fire"", and the two following it were ok. The last 3, however, just don't hold up to the classic Rush of the past, and ""Snakes And Arrows"" is no exception.The problems, as I see it, lies with the melding of the music and the lyrics/vocals. It sounds too unnatural and forced, and not in sync with each other. The best tracks here are the instrumentals, and I usually HATE instrumentals. The vocal tracks are all very similar as they just prod along, with the occasional moment that something exciting might be happening to a song, but then quickly goes back to the sluggish, generic, almost monotone singing that seems secondary to the great music behind it just waiting to leap out. Whatever Rush used to have, I don't think they are capable of finding it again, and that's too bad. I'll keep buying, hoping, and savoring the 1 or 2 listenable songs on each future offering."
2,Not my cup of tea but see you on tour boys,Doesnt do it for me and I have tried hard to like it. Still I have tickets for the two jersey shows and I'll see you all there.
3,Should be called Roll the Bones Part 2,"After Vapor Trails, which was nothing short of masterful and incredibly powerful, one of the greatest albums ever, I should have known Rush would come out with something less spectacular. Don't get me wrong, for any other group, Snakes and Arrows is a masterpiece. For Rush, it's mediocre. Like Roll the Bones, it starts out with a bang, with a catchy, driven masterpiece in Far Cry (see Dreamline from Roll the Bones), then turns into a bunch of mid-tempo, mellower songs, right until the end, again, like Roll the Bones. Neil's lyrics really save this outing, as the music is not all that inspired on this release, but the lyrics are thought-provoking and in some places almost controversial (such as the subtle attacks on religion). All in all, a mixed bag. I miss the power of Vapor Trails. I was hoping they would continue exploring that direction. Rush has already done this album."
1,The Poorest of Rush,"Was excited to hear this newer release. Played it in my car and it was absolutely depressing. Bitter lyrics and cup half empty point of view through out. I'd be surprised if there wasn't any suicide reports from people listening to this album. What were they thinking? The songs are boring musically. Not much tho't put into their musical creativity. Rush needs to return to their roots. Mind you, this is difficult coming from a Rush fan of so many years."
5,Awesome new album by Rush,A great album by Rush. More acoustic guitar and some interesting lyrical work. I love it
4,Good Effort from the Boys!,"O.K., maybe it's not Classic Rush, but it's a Very Good, well produced CD. Kudos to Nick K for helping Rush update their Sound. Like all Prog Rock it takes a few listens to get, However Rush is more into Making Solid songs these days then showing off. I'd rate this in the top 1/3 of all Rush albums. I like the Artwork on the inside better then the front cover."
2,A Far Cry from what I expected.,"I've tried to like this much anticipated CD. I really have. I don't understand why the critics love this CD, and Rush is and has always been my favorite band. Aside from Far Cry, the remaining songs are plodding and the lyrics are unusually self-indulgent. The warbling vocals were grating to such a point that the three instrumentals couldn't save this one for me. Sorry guys, but I just don't get this release."
2,RIP RUSH,"Very dissapointing. Production is good, songs are boring and lifeless. Rush's downward spiral continues. The last GREAT Rush album was 'Moving Pictures', the last GOOD rush album was 'Counterparts'. In all honestly, the downward spiral for rush began with the song ""New World Man"" on signals. I had high hopes for S&A based on the hype and the tease opening seconds of ""Far Cry"" from their website.....wow! could be like Hemispheres. Unfortunately, it was not to be. These guys just can't write good songs anymore and Geddy's vocals are really starting to falter. How can these be the same guys that wrote 'Natural Science', 'Tom Sawyer', or 'The Trees'?"
1,Where's the melody?,"Rush is known for songs that have great lyrics and great melodies. I haven't found that in Snakes and Arrows. All I hear is a bunch of instruments that sound like they were blended in a digital food processor and spit out in some kind of smooth electronic stream. None of these songs are good, none could be sung along with in concert, none have catchy lyrics or melodies to them. I am a die hard Rush fan going back to my high school days in the early 80's, and I am a huge Neil Peart fan, both his music and his motorcycling books. Therefore I am more dissapointed than most with this album."
1,Not a Good Rush album,"This is a real review, I work in Radio, and have gotten an advance copy. This album is very much like Geddy's ""My Favorite headache"" combined with ""Vapor Trails"".For some of you, that sounds like a good combo. It's not. The album wanders all over the place, never picking up steam. The lyrics are very, very negative (""I don't have faith in faith"").The first single, Far Cry is a terrific song to start the album with. Enjoy the song, because that type of energy doesn't re-appear at all here. If you enjoy instrumentals, this album may be for you. It features 3 (THREE!), and one of them is just Alex Lifeson (solo).I am a long time Rush fan, and was hoping this album was a return to form. It's not. The songs are disjointed, plodding, and soft. Please don't read this review and assume I only like the old albums. Some of my favorites are Test for Echo, Presto, and Counterparts.Not my idea of Rush. Better luck next time, guys."
1,Stale and Awful,"""Hello? Yes it's me, I'm on my mobile. What's that? I'm listening to Snakes and Arrows by Rush. What? No it's Rubbish"""
1,Where is Rush?,"Has anybody seen Rush? Yes, that famous Canadian band that has been missing since Test for Echo."
2,Single not so great,The new single does sound like a Vapor Trails track but less noisy. Noisy was in style at the time of Vapor Trails (e.g. the last Metallica album). When a band is chasing styles that's not a good thing. Far Cry was not good. It reminds me of other certain Rush songs where Geddy is bleating along and you're just waiting on the riff to start again... except there's no riff! Not good. I bought Vapor Trails and listened to it 5 or 10 times. It wasn't bad but clearly not their best work. If you listen to 2112 and then the latest stuff back-to-back you'll hear how far the mighty band Rush has fallen. More likely they've just become old and run out of ideas but not time.
1,You've Got To Be Kiding Me!!,"You meen these guys are still around?? They've all got to be like 40 now. The music sounds tired and dated, just like the members themselfes!! The singer has the same nasally voise, the drumber knows no good beats, and the guityar player just sits there and hacks out a few useless sords. Its anyones guess just what these lyrics are suposed to be about!! Nothing I can relate to. Listen people, et some Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, Death Can For Cutie, Korn, Linkin Park, Taking Back Sunday, Limp Bizkit, Kidd Rock, Drowning Pool and Staind for actual good musik!! Go Bengals, who dey!@!"
3,not very musically diverse for rush,"Personally, I liked the direction of Vapor Trails and Test for Echo where Rush was getting their second wind as a premier heavy metal band again.This cd is amazingly middle of the road with very calm straightforward pop songs. Neil peart plays the most 2/4 beats I've ever heard him play. Not very musically challenging or lyrically amazing I guess I'd have to recommend it for die hard fans only. When I think ""rush"" this is not the album I'd want to put on to impress people who haven't heard the band in a while. This is more like the Rush cd you'd put in when your girlfriend is in the car hoping to find some kind of middle ground."
2,biggest let down yet!!Are you kidding me 4 stars??????????,"Ok look ,i'm a drummer and have been a rush fan for the last 25 yrs .i've seen rush every tour twice in 25 yrs.All i have to say is (and trust me it kills me)this cd is terrible.No big hooks ,no songs to make you say Wow! that was cool.just plain boring vanilla.Iwasn't happy about their last ""cover""album and was hoping this was something that would make up for that.I literally listened to this cd 6 times already and had to force myself to get through it.I even called other friends who are huge fans and they agreed.What happened?????????I use to love every song from start to finish.Sorry but, it really hurts me to say that this is just bad.it's sad looks like i'll just keep going with dream theater and just discovered procupine tree .these guys are cool!to the past rush fans who just gave rave reviews c'mon are you serious????if you are rush fans you know this does not come close to anything they have ever done."
4,Better than the past few...,"I was beginning to despair that Rush would continue to deteriorate after Vapor Trails and the rather lame cover CD Feedback. While this is not up to the caliber of their progressive glory years like A Farewell to Kings, they retreive some of their freshness and creativity of yonder years."
1,What the heck?,"I love Rush. Not just the 70's period of ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Limelight,"" but all Rush. My favorite era is probably 80's and 90's, when the band was really mixing strong melodies with mature emotional content.I have no idea what this is all about. There's no connection anymore. There's no real soul to this disc. I feel like I'm listening to a group of people trying hard to sound relevent. It's heartbreaking. After all Neil Peart's introspective (and somewhat pretentious) literary outings, I expected the music of Rush to grow. To reach new vistas. I hate to say it but I think the guys are just out of ideas. It certainly seems that way here. This is the first Rush disc I've bought that I just can't listen to. There's just nothing here. Sorry, guys."
2,Save your money. This ain't a DVD-A.,High-res 2-channel and 5.1 DD. That's not a typo. They couldn't even bother with full-bitrate DTS.I'll leave it at that.
3,Objectively speaking....3 stars...but love the new album.,"As a Rush fan, I love this album. The only album I honestly do not care for is Test for Echo, which just doesn't do it for me. Compared to Vapor trails, the sound mix is FAR superior...and I LOVE about 1/2 the songs on this album...especially the 2 instrumentals. The other 1/2 are honestly okay for Rush standards. My rating of 3 is based upon comparing it to their other albums. Going back in time, the progression from 2112 to Signals is UNREAL!! If these albums are 5's, then I have to give Snakes&Arrows a 3, which is totally fine...I still love the new with the old. Honestly, playing 3 hours a night in their mid-50's is a 10 in my book :)"
5,Rush at there best.,One of the best albums rush has put out in years. Great lyrics along with excellent production puts rush at the top again.
4,Still Relevant!,"Amazing, Rush is still putting out new and exciting music more than 30 years after their debut. Most other bands from the 70's are doing ""Nostalgia"" tours, if they are even still together. Snakes & Arrows is somewhat nostalgic, in that it sounds more like the Rush of the late 70's and early 80's than the second half of their career. But that's a good thing, IMO.Neil's arrangements and percussion work, along Alex's guitars are fantastic, as would be expected. Somewhat surprisingly, age has made Geddy's vocals better, IMO, by softening what sometimes could be a strident edge to his voice.If you're not a Rush fan, this album won't convert you. But if you already are, this album is like a great visit home."
4,Rush Still Rocks,"I am a relatively new Rush fan. I always liked them but developed a new appreciation for them in the past few years. I bought this CD at a show after hearing the new stuff live. The song that got me live was ""Armor and Sword."" I really liked the lyrics a lot and they have significant meaning to me in my life right now. I very much enjoyed this album, more than I expected. But I kept hoping to hear some fantastic piece of drum work or a guitar riff that just made me say ""Whoa!"" I think it might be the mixing--everything is kind of kept at the same level so that there's not as much dynamics as I would hope. However, in no way is the musicianship lacking. I will say that the more you listen to it, the more you like it. I find the lyrics, though not as profound as yesteryear's, are so appropriate for the troubled times we live in now. Overall, the album was very listenable and I would highly recommend it."
4,DREAMGIRLS A HIT AGAIN,EXCELLENT SOUNDTRACK TO AN EXCELLENT MOVIE. JENNIFER HUDSON'S RENDITION OF AND I AM TELLING YOU IS AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THANK JENNIFER HOLLIDAY'S IN THE BROADWAY PLAY.
5,The best CD I have bought in past years!,"This CD is outstanding! Usually I am disappointed when I buy music, and only like 3 or so songs. This is incredible"
5,Awesome Music Soundtrack,"If you love musicals or R&B, you will love this CD. Every song from the Dreamgirls, the Movie is on this. Love it."
5,Bravo for Dreamgirls!,"This Soundtrack was entertaining from beginning to the end, especially if you were priviledged to see the movie! Different flashbacks from various scenes in the movie would come to my mind with each song! Jennifer Hudson, in a word...EXCELLENT!"
1,Cheesy Broadway musical that wont die.,"Just saw the movie and although the performers gave their best the musical score really brings the whole project to cheeseville. The music has that late 70's early 80's Broadway pop sound that can only be tolerated with a lot of glitzy stage distractions. Not once even in the soulfully sung yet very ponderous ""I'm telling you..."" could you imagine this music being written and performed by black americans in the 1960's-70's. Unlike pop music which doesn't need to move a plot the songs here are drama ballad after drama ballad, really quite exhausting not inspiring."
1,Original Broadway Cast The Best!,"I just got the 2-disc Special Edition,Original Broadway Cast,Remastered & Brilliant!!!I was there for the Broadway Production & i don't think any sountrack can compare to the original,especially this new Re-Mastered Edition.As you can see Amazon has already sold out the Broadway CD S.E.Call me jaded,but i would wait till the movie comes out to see if Beyonce's DreamGirls even compares.That is for you folks that have seen the Original Broadway Production.Jennifer Holiday,Sheryl Lee Ralf & Loretta Devine & the rest of the Original Broadway Cast,The Very Best!!!!!"
1,Obviously I am the minority on this,"Maybe many of the reviewers can not remember the original soundtrack with Jennifer Holiday. I certainly can and each time that I hear Ms. Hudson's version of ""I am telling you"", I have to turn the radio off because it is so bad. There is no comparison between the versions. It reminds me of Jay Anthony Brown (Tom Joyner Morning Show) murdering another hit. That is exactly what Ms. Hudson did. She murdered a classic hit.But I can not totally blame her because like other young artists, she is missing the true talent that her predecessors possesed. Aretha, Gladys, Minnie, Roberta, Whitney, Jean Carne, Melba....These young ladies today are more hype than talent. I truly feel sorry for this generation."
4,Good songs,I bought this CD because I enjoyed the movie and the songs on it. I find myself replaying certain songs but the whole CD is good.
5,Jennifer moved me to tears--twice,"I've seen Dreamgirls twice now, and each time Jennifer sang ""And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going,"" I was reduced to a blubbering mess. Her performance, for me, was that moving. I've always admired Jennifer Holiday's(the original Effie) version, but Jennifer Hudson's version is much more subtlely nuanced, relying on her acting to carry the song where it needed to go, compared to Jennifer Holiday's in-your-face-I'm going-to-slap-you- if-you-don't-listen- to-me-version. I was so happy to see that she won the Golden Globe, as she, hands down, deserved it. If you've enjoyed listening to her sing and haven't seen her performance, please go and see why people have stood up in the theater, cheering for this unbelievable and gifted talent."
4,You'll want this CD...,"As I was watching the ""Dreamgirls"" movie, I remember thinking to myself, I want the soundtrack CD! I think most people who have seen the film would agree.Although Beyonce and Jennifer Hudson have been getting most of the attention, the truth is that the entire cast does a knockout job. Some songs make you want to dance, while others will almost move you to tears. You'll enjoy the ""Dreamgirls"" soundtrack."
5,SPEECHLESS,"JENNIFER, IS SUCH AN INSPRIATION.... IM SO MOTIVATED BY HER. SHE IS WHAT IVE BEEN TELLING US PLUMP WOMEN FOR ALONG TIME. A SUPERSTAR TRUE INDEED. AND YES CHICHAGO'S OWN. YOU GO GIRL, A VOICE OF TRIUMPH...."
5,Dazzling,"A wonderful soundtrack the movie is great i especially love jennifer hudson's voice good songs like one night only,move,fake your way to the top, and caddilac car"
1,Dreamgirls,I was really very disappointed in this CD it wasn't what I though it was. I would not reccommend this CD to anyone.
4,Single and Deluxe soundtrack versions are different,"First of all let me say great movie! Seen it twice at show! Everyone claps after Jennifer Hudsons performace of And I Am Telling You Im Not Going. Anyway i dont own either copy of this officially, but have downloaded songs from it. I do notice that some of the songs are sung differently on this single version and the deluxe. Example on the Deluxe 2 cd set the song Hard To Say Goodbye My Love is the version from the movie where Beyonce is singing lead. The version on this single soundtrack its not Beyonce singing lead, its someone else. So some of the songs are different. Since i dont own either cd im not sure what other ones are exactly different, but im sure there is others like this example."
4,Hudson Rules,A really fun musical. Jennifer Hudson is smashing and Eddie Murphy is great. Beyonce and Foxx are underwhelming and undistinguished.
5,"I'm glad that you had it.,","I do not know what is wrong with Nikon in why that they cannot deliver on time, but at least that you had it in stock, and that I needed for my lens - thank you"
5,It Is Exactly What I Wanted,I ordered this lens cap to replace a Pro Master Lens cap that I was using on my Nikon 70-300mm lens. The Pro Master lens cap was always falling off if the lens was bumped. I bought this lens cap and have had no issues with it coming off inadvertently. What can I say. It is a very good lens cap and does what I want it to do.
2,"Good story, unedited raw text though","I love the work of F.W. Boreham, and I enjoyed reading about George Selwyn--however, this is an unedited raw text straight from an archive website. I bought a copy for $20 and it is full of errors, only mostly readable.I recommend finding other editions of F.W. Boreham's works. John Broadbanks Publishing is working on republishing several of them in more affordable versions."
3,Hitchcock's first hits hard and weird 20 years later,"Collecting the three different versions of the immortal Soft Boy's first album on cd was quite an accomplishment... And it's a shame that Rykodisc's contract to release it are up. If you're a Hitchcock fan, it's a must. ""Leppo and the Jooves"", ""Human Music"", and many more are collected here. This was Hitchcock at his hardest, and when it works it is something to hear. Of course, not all of it works, but if this is your thing, you won't mind a bit. Hitchcock's ""fishy"" lyrics are both sardonic and strange, but crank it up and enjoy! And get it while you can!"
4,Pan-African artist,"What is interesting about this CD by Dobet Gnahore is her polyglot singing: Dida and Guere of her own Ivory Coast; Wolof of Senegal; Malinke of Mali; Xhosa of South Africa; Fon of Benin; and Lingala of the Congo. There is also a brief vocalise polyphony in homage of the Pygmies. She has a warm, soft voice and the various African styles are nicely arranged and well performed. True, the CD does not have an instant popular ""hit"" song and she does not dominate with a unique sound, yet the album overall is a relaxed tour of Africa in the same spirit as Putumayo's Acoustic Africa CD and tour, which included the contribution by Gnahore. From the inserted notes and pictures, she may have exciting stage presence. This CD is not of classic calibre, but I still very much enjoyed listening to it, about 5 times now. It provides a sense of quiet dignity and passion."
5,Wonderful historical account of cooking in America,This is one of my favorite books. I keep it on the coffee table and several of my guests agree and are also looking for a new edition to be printed.
5,parental guidence,"So far the book is great. I am only reading a little at a time, but it is very helpful."
5,MacArthur deals with the real issues facing parenthood today,"As a single person I rejoice in the goodness of God who has granted me the opportunity to read this book before I have a family. I can now look ahead with great confidence knowing that I have the tools to be a good parent, to raise children well, and that I have a God who is faithfull and has given me everything needed to be a ""succesful Christian parent""."
2,"Digitally Remastered ""NOT!""","What they mean is that it was recorded on to dvd from whatever garbage source material they had. It was only ""digitaly transfered"".The color was horribly red. A simple filter to boost the blue and green would have helped. Also the contrast was wayy over the top.I know for a fact that there is a better version of this movie out there because I saw it on cable (possibly encore or turner classic movies?) a few years ago.I only got this for the lovely Quinn Oharra pool scene which I remember quite well.Not sure if the grind house dvd that has that other movie on it is a different version or not. Doubt it."
2,K&N 33-2144 High Performance Replacement Air Filter,"Too much oil applied already. Oil dripping all over. My mechanic & I were worried about MAF sensor malfunction as others described. I had to return this product. However, the build quality seemed good."
4,Good Book for Gastric Bypass Patients,"I am reading this book now. I must say I was a little bit disappointed in that Paula put down any other surgeries than the one she had which was the gastric bypass. I am planning on having a lap band surgery and I think it is to each person's own decision. She said in her book chapter 5 that the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is considered the ""gold standard"" against which other surgical options are measured. This is her opinion. Both the gastric bypass and lap band surgeries are tools for weight loss. I understand that she is partial to gastric bypass, because that is what she had, but at the same time, there is no reason to say that the gastric bypass is the ""gold standard"". I have been to seminars and also seen my doctor and he said that this year lap band surgeries will probably be out numbering the gastric bypass. I can say that I would recommend this book to gastric bypass patients, because it has very good information for you."
2,Expected More,"If you have done any kind of brief reasearch already, either before or just after your own surgery, then this book will be a waste of your time because you probably won't learn anything new. In fact, the most engaging paragraphs in the entire book are quotes from other books! Also, there are a lot of lists included for this and that, some of which are quite redundant and seem to be included just to take up space. I expected a little more insight, but was dissapointed."
2,Everything your surgeon should have told you,"First, the title is misleading because the book deals with pre-surgery nearly as much as post-surgery issues. If you had surgery through a decent program, your surgeon or program staff should have already told you most of what Peck covers. If you are looking for that information in book form, this is for you. If you are looking for additional information, there are other, more relevant books out there."
4,okay but not great,has potential to be a good resource but too much trite info. - good if you haven't read other books on the subject but if you have - not too much new info.
2,Want to buy mine?,I was disappointed with the book. She did a lot of skipping around. I was expecting more about her journey but she always just ended up talking about how wonderful she is.
2,Not what I thought,"This book is ok if you have very little knowledge about Gastric Bypass. It also has a lot on before the fact. I was looking for something with more on after the surgery and keeping the weight off and dealing with emotional eating.The book info made it sound like it covered more on this. I would not buy again.In fact, will probably put up for sale here!"
3,nothing new,"I've already read a lot on this subject, since I had my surgery two years ago. It would be an excellent resource for someone who recently had the surgery, but I found nothing new."
5,My post-op bible,My bariatric surgeon's office provided me with a copy of this book. It is a wonderful book and a great source of info for both pre-op and post-op patients. I can't recommend the book highly enough.
4,Some good ideas to get involved,I am a 2 week pre-op gastric bypass reader. Found the book to be standard in some areas (any research on surgery would cover those areas) but also full of fresh good ideas. Offers key points at the end of each chapter to get you involved. I have already incorporated some of the suggestions. I know I will refer to it again and again. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is the writer mentions her trips too frequently for those whose income and job excludes them from going on a journey to Peru as a reward for weight loss or flying to a plastic surgeon in L.A.
5,Exodus From Obesity,"Paula Peck provides the reader with a window into the world of gastric bypass surgery. Not merely detailed, but written in a way that a patient can understand and grasp the complexities involved with any weight loss surgery, and the life changing event it will become. Frank yet compassionate, Paula refers to her own experiences and tries to give insight where there is fear, guilt and shame. This book is an essential reference tool for me as I have begun my journey to better health through weight loss."
5,"Someone who has come a long way in Toledo,Ohio",The name of the book says a lot. This was well written and had many interesting points.I would tell everyone that is thinking about or who has had the weight loss opperation to read this book.There are many tips to help you when you are at a plato to help get the ball rolling again.
4,Oldie but goodie,"Reread in 2010...Typical mid-60s SF - themes of freedom vs mind control & brainwashing, personal responsibility vs governmental control, man and woman finding THE ONE that completes them, the hero larger than life with vulnerable moments... Since it's the 60s and not the 50s the heroine is a scientist rather than a secretary but still needs to be rescued by the hero.It's nice to read the occasional book done in black-and-white rather than endless shades of gray."
3,"""I wanna call ya . . .""",""" . . . I wanna ball ya, eeeeeeeeewwwwwwwww!"" - ""Baby Strange""Wow people! It just doesn't get any more brilliant than that!Seriously though, there's a reason why T. Rex's music isn't widely known today. Aside from a few choice songs, it really isn't all that great and most of it sounds pretty dated. Today, the majority of T. Rex's music sounds like fairly run-of-the-mill ""boogie-woogie"" rock n' roll. Marc Bolan does deserve credit for spearheading Glam Rock, but he was soon surpassed by David Bowie who made the timeless glam-rock classic ZIGGY STARDUST AND THE SPIDERS FROM MARS.If you're new to T. Rex, just be aware that this forum attracts a lot of non-objective worship from die-hard fans. It's perfectly understandable that some people like this music, but moreso for those who were actually around to witness the glam rock craze unfold."
5,Rise and fall of glam-rock,"Right after Beatlemania T.Rexmania started. It's not that easy to find someone equal to Marc Bolan as composer and musician. Glam-rock started with him was invented by him, and glam-rock was Marc Bolan. Bowie came after. T.Rex gave a chance to Slade. And to Cockney Rebel (Harley was co-opted by Bolan). ""Slider"" definitely is one of the best and most important albums of the century. The rest of T.Rex is a MUST as well"
4,T Rex 's Ultimate Album,"If you buy one T Rex CD get this one!This is the height of Marc Bolan's songwriting ability and is one of those albums that flows seamlessly from the first song right through to the last. A perfect example of a classic rock album, it's boogie swagger and post hippie glam metal pop rock shake make it a firm soundtrack for the early seventies. There is so much good boogie pop rock that flows so easily from the fingertips of Mr. Bolan that no one ever really equalled T Rex in this genre of music.Song highlights: Metal Guru - an anthem for the glam generation, The Slider - the title track and easily one of T Rex's greatest songs, Buick MacKane, Chariot Choogle - two irresistably catchy chug along rockers, Telegram Sam - probably the best known song from the album.Get this CD you can't go wrong."
5,One of the best albums ever,"Marc Bolan is the most underrated rock influence of all time, and this is easily the best T. Rex album - one the most fluid/complete albums ever produced."
5,and when i'm sad - - - I Slide!,"this is the epitomy of T REX.I am a huge fan originally hooked from the U.S. release of Electric Warrior and on.Slider outshines warrior and is the ultimate album.I recommend Slider then warrior for beginners. Then if you appreciate them, you can buy everything you can get your hands on.This release of slider includes a 2nd disc of the album pre-slick production. I love them both.While the production version of the title song is great with the strings,I also like the stripped down version. I would have to say I like them equally. It depends on my mood as to which one I will listen to. It is a shame what drug addiction did to his talent and life. Then the tragic auto accident when he cleaned up and was making a go of it once more. Rock on, Rock on, yeah,yeah,yeah"

5,Needs to be heard! This Works!,"I bought this book for a buddy who isn't online. Hard working carpenter, family man and a good person in his late 50's Likely picked up hep in the military with a blood transfusion, he'll never know. He's been through the Pegasus treatment, it hadn't worked but had about broken them financially, as well as being very hard on him physically. They wanted him to do it again. His blood work indicated he was actually worse than before he did it.So he asks me to buy another book from Amazon about herbs and hep C, and i do, but see this and i bought it for him. Actually fealt moved to buy it for him. He ended up calling Dr. Zhang and going to him. He's well now. This costs a fraction of the Pegasus treatment ahd wasn't hard on him physically. But i repeat the actual bottom line. His blood work say's he's got it well under control. True story. He asked me to be sure to put it out on the web. He's still something of a luddite. But he's a healthy luddite now."

4,Decent book.,"This book offers a step by step process of installing the Tomcat webserverto Unix (primarily) and Windows servers. at every stage, the authors havetaken the time to include the information about windows operating system.the authors have taken the time to arrange the flow of the chapters tomatch the events in a real world server configuration exercise of anapache. the book also describes the differences in the versionf of Apachefor the benefit of users.In all, the book is good material for the not-so experienced apache userslike me.regardsRavi MahalingamColumbia, SC Java Users group."
4,Java 1 there's a good reason,"Hi,I read a few weeks ago some reviews complaining that this textbook doesn't deal with recent Java SDK like 4.1 or 5. Then I had trouble ping-ing an XP home pc, so I learned that ping works with ICMP, I thought maybe if I write a little ping-debugger I'd get somewhere near an answer, my PC linux is a Debian, I searched for some ICMP Java classes for Debian, then I found out that the latest Java SDK for Linux is 1.1. So don't put the blame on this Apache manual (IMHO) ""il ne peut pas aller plus vite que la musique"""
1,Waste of paper,"Most of the time you can trust O'Reilly technical books. But this dog should be drug out back and shot. It's out of date, it's poorly written, it meanders all over the place. I'm pretty tolerant of technical writing as long as I'm learning what I need to along the way. But at a time when I was highly motivated to get up to speed on Apache I literally gave up and threw this on the floor in frustration. Buy any other book on Apache. This one sucks."
2,Lacks important details,"I read this over the summer. You would be better off saving yourself the money and going to apache.org. This book lacks important details for anyone that is new to apache. She expects to much out of the reader. The way she suggests to implement apache is confusing and useless. I believe this book is outdated as well. I just purchased Web Application Design and Implementation: Apache 2, PHP5, MySQL, JavaScript, and Linux/UNIX (Quantitative Software Engineering Series)by Steven Gabarro. Hopefully it will be better than this train wreck definitive guide."
5,This book served its purpose.,"Now you may think that there are better books out there. And there maybe. However this book is a ""five star"" book. I bought this book for a beginning apache class. We were able to follow the instructions and down load the Apache server from the Internet. The only problem we had was with the NIS system that was not anticipated in this book. It was a lot more important to use this book to read the flat files and see how they were related to each other. The section on Extra Modules (chapter 12) gave a way to improve the server and go outside the scope of this book. This book covered more details than I was looking for; this ways different people can use the book to target their particular needs. You can safely say:""This book has everything you need to set up an apache server.""Apache Cookbook: Solutions and Examples for Apache Administrators"
1,Don't bother,"I didn't find this book useful at all. In 2+ years of administering Apache on Linux and Solaris, this book didn't help a single time. Use the Apache documentation provided along with Apache (the web server) instead. You'll be a lot better off."
5,Shopping Adventures,How much fun this is to discover the world of fabulous fashion from years gone by! I loved the history lesson to accentuate the appreciation of the value of vintage and designer clothing. I look forward to trips to the cities mentioned in the book and many shopping adventures in my future!
2,This book is not worth the money,This book is basically just a list of resale stores in some bigger cities. The same information could be obtained in twenty minutes with some basic research.
5,Links LS 2000,"The best computer golf game period.I have downloaded Demo,s of2001 thru 2003 and no comparison.A look backward by Microsoftmight give them a clue for the future."
2,Back To 2000,Graphcs are great. PERIOD. Sound set up is almost impossible to coordinate with selected motions. None of my 25 add-on courses purchased over the life of previous versions work on this engine. I've taken it off my machine and reinstalled Links 2000. Now I'm useing the good one.
2,Be Hesistant When Buying This Product,"If you already have some of the add on courses that went with Microsoft Golf 2.0 and Links 386, they probably would be outdated for this new version and wouldn't transfer. Find out before you get this."
5,LS 2000 Is The Best Simulation Out There,"Links LS is a God send to golf fanatics of all ages. The realism is uncanny and the play is almost as good as being there. The game is easy to play and even offers lessons on how to play better. This software also has internet play built right in. You can play on-line tournaments or even one-one play at The Gaming Zone. Microsoft also sells add on courses that makes you feel like a pro. You couldn't get on these PGA courses in real life, but with Links LS you are there! Don't worry about the software going out of date. I previously owned LS 99 and decided to upgrade. To my surprise, Microsoft offered a $15 rebate if you owned a previous Links LS version. You will be amazed at this game. If you are trying to decide between Tiger's Game or any other sim game, wonder no more. This game is IT!"
3,"Good Concept, but Performance is Lacking in Areas","In Usher's latest single, he explores his own attitude toward the young women he dates, hence the title ""My Way"". The song's intensity can use a big boost. The lyrics are well-written but rarely heard. The rythm is decent, but the overpowering background music is too heavy and the only thing you will walk away remembering is the chorus. Overall Grade: C"
4,NOT your children's Shel Silverstein's book!,"Our school library received this book through the school board's ""approved"" book list. Obviously, the author's name was enough for the reviewer to okay this title. Upon receiving the book, it was obvious that the list-maker at the school board had relied only on the Shel Silverstein name without actually opening the book for review. Although very cute for the 18+ age group, this is most certainly NOT a children's book. The grapic adult cartoons are funny if you are a ""grown-up"" but can give your children a crash course in sex-ed if you don't screen this book first. Funny for adults; not intended for children!"
4,No words?,"For a book that I didnot realize contained few words, it was joyful none-the-less. Mr. Silverstein is perfectly capable of conveying all desired meanings (with his typical humor and sarcasm) through well crafted pictures."
5,Fun and thought provoking,"I came across this book on my honeymoon five years ago. Our dinner reservation was in an hour, so we decided to hang out in the little reading room in the bed & breakfast. At first, I just looked around and my eyes caught sight of a large Shel Silverstein book that I had never heard of. I spent the entire hour enjoying every page of it. It was then that I first learned that Uncle Shelby hadn't always been writing for children! Buy it if you can!"
1,Never heard a word.,"Vendor never shipped the product and did not contact me to tell me. I finally tried several times to contact the vendor, and was advised item was out of stock. This after it was too late for making Christmas candy for gift giving."
2,More Scholarly than Interesting,"I heard a reference to this book on NPR in a humorous vein, so I incorrectly made the assumption it would be enlightening but humorous or at least informative. It's probably of interest to bibliophiles and amateur historians, but for the casual reader it's dense and disjointed. I'd be sure to read a few pages--and look at the Table of Contents--before buying to see if it meets your tastes and interests. Note: I only read about 25% of it so there may be more to this than I found."
2,"Thought it would be exciting, it wasn't.","The title was the most interesting part of this book. I tried to read it on several occasions but could only get through a page or two before giving up. The best part, it was at least free."
5,Bleach at its best,Thanks for an awesome deal! This is a difficult item to get a hold of. Thanks again!
2,bring back the old bleach,WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED.....this cd has bad breath.i loved te first bleach album space.....but this one is horrible.the only reason i gave it a 2 was because i really like the song super good fealing.personally the first album beats this one to death.dont get this cheesy album.......AT LEAST THEY PRAISE GOD
2,- Bland - - Bland - - Bland - - Bland - - Bland - - Bland -,"I am sorry to burst the bubble but to see this record with a perfect 5star review is to me not right. This is a BORING BORING BORING record. I am glad someone else has enjoyed it because only recently have been able to finish it. I believe that 1star ratings should be as difficult to get as 5star ratings and this record is perilously close to 1star. This record is utterly lacking in creativity. It seeks to copy the generic nagging approach to altrock that certain bands (that i, appropriately enough, cannot remember the names of now) have made good on a hit or two with in MTV Buzz bins. Amazingly, [Static] falls short of even this standard mostly because of pop ""melodies"" that are tired and uninteresting. Vocalist, Dave Baysinger, looks and sounds as if his lifelong ambition has been becoming the third Gallegher brother(of Oasis). Let's all pray for them."
5,a clean fresh citrus scent real lemmon,"I love this scent, it smells like you just sliced a lemmon. Very clean, fresh, last a long time. I love it.And it is not expensive like other perfumes."
4,Fujiyama,"Hard to find in stores and if your lucky to do find it its Over $25.Love it! smells clean and light, great summer fragrance!"
1,Masculine,"I did not like this, it smelled like mens cologne. It did not have the citris scent that was discribed."
2,Low Quality VCR,"When recording in S-VHS or VHS-ET the picture quality is poor. The picture is grainy and the detail isn't there. Recording in SLP is extrememly poor. Automatic tracking is useless, you practically have to track manually each tape. Playback of store-bought tapes is decent, though. No complaints about the features or the remote. The unit is indeed very light, as another reviewer said, but these days all VCRs are much lighter than they used to, so you shouldn't judge it by that. I returned it to the store, needless to say and wouldn't recommend this VCR to anyone. I guess Panasonic isn't what it used to be."
1,Great while it lasted,"It did everything they advertised, vcr plus, scanning through commercials, universal remote, you name it.It died within 24 months. Something with the motor on the VCR. It would run for a few minutes, then conk out. Sometimes I couldn't even eject the tape. I replaced it with another Panasonic VCR, and it also died within 24 months.I'm done with Panasonic for good."
3,"Fun, but expensive","You won't really increase your vocab much with this book because nothing is in meaningful context, but the puzzles are fun to do. However, for what is essentially a Dell-type puzzle book, it's too expensive for so few puzzles. The publisher should put out this type of book on cheaper paper and sell them the way English puzzle books are sold in the states (and as Spanish puzzle books are sold here in Mexico)."
5,Fun puzzles,I have been taking Spanish language courses and so far this book is fun way to learn and remember new Spanish words . I highly recommend even if just for the fun.
3,"Ok toy but ""mouse"" light is no good","My cat does go crazy looking for the red dot, but I bought this pointer specifically because it had the mouse light. The light barely looks like a mouse...more like a mess of light. And it isnt different tips like most laser pointers. It is a spinning top that rotates to each different image (all not right)."
2,The mouse has button problems,"I bought this mouse after my original dell mouse gave up. I was excited by the potentials of so many programmable buttons and it worked great in the beginning. After a while the main button stopped working. When I click on something, it clicks it with a double click (even though it's set for a single click). When I try to click and drag, it doesn't hold onto the object I'm clicking and dragging on (Making it impossible to work with in PhotoShop or highlighting text). When I'm browsing the web, if I scroll through the page quickly it will take me back to previous page (very annoying). I'm running on Win 98. It has a good vision, but the execution will disappoint."
3,Some Problems,"Overall this mouse is a good buy with some problems. The Problems are mainly in Windows 2000 drivers, which were mentioned by the other reviewers before me. Yet I have to say that it works great with Macs, including OSX. The feel of the mouse is very good, but if you have ever used Logitech's ergonomic mice, you will find that the shape of the mouse matters more than you thought. It will take some time for you to get used to the thumb button especially, which is not as easily workable. Nevertheless an OK deal for the money."
1,WARNING--The Buttons are Untrustworthy,"The Kensington mouse is sleek and elegant and best of all not too expensive which is what drew it to my attention however it has one problem that overshadows all of its buttons and sleek design, the buttons are untrustworthy. I say this meaning that when you click you can't count on it to click 100% of the time. When it does work (which is most of the time) you can't count on it to continually hold as it will occasionally just give up. This can be a serious problem when dragging files as the mouse will let go when you don't. I use the mouse for gaming where it has driven me insane for half a year. I can't take it anymore, I'm buying another mouse and I advise you to do the same."
5,Great mouse value,"This is an excellent choice for an optical mouse. Of course, I wouldn't consider using a non-optical mouse any longer, and this one is well worth the cost, with programmable side buttons and a comfortable design. I use the default configuration for the side buttons, having the one on the right side being treated as a ""double click"" which I find very convenient.For the price, this mouse is an excellent value."
2,Funky buttons,"I love optical mice, but this one's buttons are either sticky or just nonfunctional. The buttons sometimes tell the computer that one click means ""two clicks!"" or ""five clicks!"" Other times, when I drag to select something, the selection doesn't hold. It makes me crazy. It comes and goes, but really makes my job difficult sometimes. I'm buying another one and throwing this one out the window."
5,Good to see these back in print.,"Bundling Heavy-Time and Hellburners like this is a great idea because, unlike the majority of C.J. Cherry's Spacer/Alliance-Union stories, these two books are best read in the correct order so as to get the best out of them. When I read them first I unknowingly started with Hellburners, which wasn't too much of a problem as it was fairly self contained. Even so, I always thought it would have been better to have them combined - like she is doing with her Chanur books. The new title is rather intriguing, too."
2,Typos galore,"When the product description says ""This is an OCR edition with typos,"" it isn't lying.I read about this book in a letter from a historian in the New York Times and immediately ordered it.The kindle edition had several typos on the first two pages that made it impossible to determine the sense of the sentences containing them. Clearly no human reviewed even the first pages of this book.I have read other old, out of print books on my kindle that were fine. This one, not so much. I had to go to google books to discover what the book really says. I mean to slog on through but clearly it's gonna be a hard task. I wish I could correct my own Kindle version as I go."
1,Don't buy this one,"the typographical errors are rampant and the book is near impossible to read. Doesn't anyone review these before putting them up for sale? I will try to get my money back and, perhaps purchase the other volumes"
1,Un stinker tres grande,"It seems as if it came out of the late 50's early 60's French existentialist movement; discordant (annoying) musical sounds, repeated to emphasize one-knows-not: short movements within scenes repeated quickly to no positive addition to the viewer: It is hard to explain how bad it is other than to say it is hard to watch and not at all entertaining (unless perhaps you are a very depressed person).God wants to make love to a woman, based on an ancient myth regarding Zeus. That plot and some full frontal nudity sounds like the movie couldn't be that bad. It is. The background scenery is nice. The rest is fractured editing of fractured shots of actors struggling with bad dialogue. It is all so very dated and not worth watching; not all things retro are good."
2,Not That Insightful,"The book offers a few tidbits, but not enough for me to read the entire thing.The format is not arranged well for a logical, detail oriented mind. It is more a series of quick essays on topics. It is conversational, but not as developed in reason.If you've done self-awareness work I would say there is a lot more useful material out there - things that will help you far more with greater patterns. Borrow the book and read a few essays, see what you think. If you're looking for clear understandings, I don't think this is for you. If you are looking for someone to talk to you, without getting too deep into they subject matter, this may be just what you are looking for."
5,Life Altering,DeMello totally blew me away. This book is an incredible piece of work. This book changed my whole way of thinking and explained why I have lived my whole life in pain.
5,Near Perfect Book,"Though I did not agree with everything De Mello wrote it still was a near perfect book. I found myself waking up in the middle of the night and reading it with my solar flashlight. I found it a great help in generating positive thoughts in which to fall back asleep to, resetting me for the day to come."
5,The Real Thing,"As a Fordham ( NY's Jesuit college ) grad,it may be permissible to say Anthony DeMellois the greatest Catholic writer on spiritualmatters. Awareness is the book! Too bad thethe Pope INC. doesn't get it."
5,excellent,I like this book and I've given a few away to my friends. I'msure you'll want to do this too so go ahead and order several copies...
5,The kind of book you recommend to people you love.,"This is a book I have read and reread, in bits and pieces, when I want to feel refreshed. It reminds me of what is important in life. Put it on your nightstand, along with the other books that you never reshelve."
3,"Nice content, quirky presentation","I must say that there are some good insights in this book and perhaps it will strike your fancy, it just didn't strike mine. Right off the bat there was a typo within the first few pages, the font is strange, and the presentation is in the style of a talk at a retreat. So the language is colloquial and idiosyncratic. If you're not a logical type you might enjoy the folksy, somewhat confrontational style of the dialogue. It's just not my cup of tea. I see that others have given very high reviews and let me qualify my criticisms with a nod to the fact that the insights presented herein are in line with some of the greatest teachers I have read and thus you should not discount this book. I just found it strange to see a book with such high ratings and so many glaring faults at the same time."
2,familiar themes,"This book may work for you, but it did not hit me in any powerful way. The style is casual and confident, at times seemingly overconfident and hyperbolic. As with other books in this area, the ends are presented with words (like ""wake up"") that almost make it appear easy to achieve, yet whether it is easy or hard depends on the person. It is tempting to get caught up in the mystique of eastern ideas. Probably readers with little exposure to minfullness and detachment will find it more useful than did I."
3,Kind of a Weird Metaphysics Book,"This book was decent. I won't say that I'd be hot to trot about buying it again, but I will say it makes you think about things.My friend recommended this book to me. He had mentioned that it was a good blend up meditation of spiritual ideas from multiple sources. He said it was enlightening. In fact he said the writer was enlightened.There are a good many things that this book says that make sense. It's main idea is that we should be more than just aware of our actions but also our motivations behind them as well as our motivations behind our motivations.What I wasn't a fan of is how he came across a bit abrasive and uncothly blunt. Unfortunately it came across as being negative and indicating that humans are all selfish at their core. Which is a bit different than I'd any other spirituality book I've read."
5,My Wake Up Call,This was the best book that I have ever read in my life. I have passed it along to many friends and would recommend it highly to everyone who is not my friend. A must for long term understanding.
5,De Mello is always a treat,De Mello thoughts are well represented here. It is a clear and challenging to anyone seeking to widen horizons and gain depth.
5,DeMello,"Full of wisdom and compassion, the ideas set forth in this book seem to resonate deep inside you. Anthony challenges, prods, inspires and illuminates with his narrative. A book to be cherished and read again and again. This book has been my constant companion for years, helping me as I try to make sense of this constantly changing world that we live in."
5,The World Should Read This Book,"I have been telling my friends to read it, and loaning my copy to other friends. I read it in three intense days, and it changed my life. (Only because I was ready to hear the messages it held, mind you) It is a slap in the face if you have never thought these things, and it is a refreshing reminder if you have. I will never forget this image: (not a direct quote) If you can remember that you are the sky, not the clouds, then you will be separate from the stress. All any of us need ever do is shift our focus. Which is why I am an optimist, idealist, dreamer, philosopher, psychologist, without picking apart and killing the subjects and objects. I hope the world is ready for this."
5,"changing the world, one self at a time","has tremendous value, if one is motivated to gain insight into one's own behavior."
5,Awareness by A. DeMello,"This book did not appear as the photo indicated but once the cover is opened, a whole world is splashed out before the reader creating so much more than the book offers from the description. I was extremely satisfied with the purchase. I bought the book on a referral from someone who did not tell me anything about it, the shipping was more than reasonable and the Seller was very quick to deliver. This was my second purchase with Amazon.com and overall this was one of the most pleasant purchases I have ever made. Thank you very much."
5,Best spiritual book to wake up!,"Awarennes is a GEM!!! A friend of mine told me about this book when I was going through a difficult time in my life. Oh boy!!! Did it change my life? It completely revolutioniozed my thinking. Since then I have followed De Mello's teachings and I have learned to see life from a ""differente, good, healthy perpective."" Coming across his teaching was liberating. I have never looked back. I wish more people knew about this great man. I am sure there would be less suffering if people were willing to put in practice some of his ideas! Go for it and BREAK away from the CHAINS holding you back!!!"
5,a great work,"It saddens me that some Catholics find this book unchristian - the point is that this book reaches the spiritual truth that is at the heart of every religious tradition. It goes beyond demonination and beyond concepts and beliefs - right to the essence of reality itself, where is nothing but pure consciousness and well-being. Anthony DeMello was a spiritual teacher who just happened to express himself in a Christian framework. But really there's little difference between him and teachers like Eckhart Tolle or Krishnamurti. In fact I came across this book on the recommended reading list on Eckhart Tolle's website, where I have found other fantastic books such as The Fall by Steve TaylorThe Fall: The Evidence for a Golden Age, 6,000 years of Insanity and the Dawning of a New Eraand the work of Gangaji."
3,Anthills of the Savannah,I thought the author did a good job depicting some believable but typical characters. It is a story or struggle and hope.
3,The Show Must Go On,"Actors are a plucky and intrepid lot. Having been one myself eons ago, I can attest to the perseverance that Granger's cast of characters exude even if the show they're trying to put on is mind-numbingly awful and their personal lives are repeatedly distracted by the workings of nefarious characters. Her female amateur sleuth Fran Varady is well drawn and self-sufficient as a former resident of the streets, and a good job has been done in authentically painting the London cityscape in which the mayhem transpires. It's a cozy read for a dark and stormy night with a pot of tea by one's side but, alas, I wasn't as surprised by the outcome as I was hoping to be. Nonetheless, I'll be watching for Granger's next novel.Christina HamlettAuthor of ""Movie Girl"""
1,don't buy this product--too small for healthy fish!,This tank is too small. I don't even have my teeny female betta in a bowl this little. Be kind to your fish and give him some more room to turn his little fishy tail around!
5,Excellent gentle training guide,Gentle and kind pet training has come a long way in recent years. This video is one of the best at showing how to train your dog without using force or punishment. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to have fun while working with your pet.
4,"Matthew Coleman age 12 from San Jose, CA",The video is pretty good. Its pretty quick and I think it will teach you how to train a dog. It was understandable and informative. I would recommend it to anyone who has a dog. I think it would be good for eight year olds to 68 because after that you kind of don't want to train a dog. I think this method works pretty good.
1,don't waste your time,"The video actually says it teaches your dog how to get you a tissue. The instructions lasted about 40 seconds by Renee sitting in a chair telling you to use the ""get it"" command, ""bring it command"" whenever you sneeze. There was no step by step instructions of any type; just her telling you to do it.Don't waste your hard earned cash by blowing it away with this video. I wish I could return it because I am so unsatisfied. There is much more detailed and free information on clicker/trick training on the internet."
3,London's sensuality in spotlight,"Julie London sings songs containing every month of the year in the first CD on this twofer and then turns her tones onto a handful of standards. Through it all, London is embraced by superb and lush arrangements. Very few of the songs, put London in a swinging mood, and she mostly delivers these titles in her slow, breathy style. Though her""It's a Blue Word"" is a departure from this and it is especially good. But much of the album sounds the same and the lack of a nice complement of upbeat songs, keeps this from being a must-have disc."
5,Your Number Please by Miss London is breathtaking...,"Julie London sings with strings, and an orchestra arranged and conducted by Andre Previn, this moody album's highlights include the ultimate version of Makin Whoopee, and a breathtaking beautiful version of ""When I Fall In Love."" London sounds inspired and in a romantic mood, never have her velvety vocals sounded so delicious. An added extra is Calendar Girl another 50's LP is included on this two lp's on one CD, Calendar Girl is a concept album with a song for each month of the year, cute huh..., the price of the cd is worth it alone for Your Number Please and the cover art work for Calender Girl."
5,Classic and Unforgettable Female Jazz Singer,Julie London is now a vital part of the Jazz Genre in America and the Worldand will forever share that distinction with several other incredible Female Jazz singers from the 40's and 50's.Her voice and performing style are so unique that I doubt we will see another singer come close to her style of presenting herself..
4,Single and busy mom reads for aide,"This was stocking stuffer at Christmas. Is being read by my daughter, a single mom who's busier than most. Needs all the help she can get, was pleased to see this being read. So far, her youngin is a top notch kid ! We are proud of both of them!"
4,"""what is a mother to do? What is a daughter to do?""","I usually don't like teens' books that address one gender; I tried to be open minded about it but I refuse to think of boys and girls as two different species (even though evidence disproves me every day). I got this book as my way of exiting my state of denial about girls' problems being totally different than those of boys, I'm still in denial but the book is very sweet and charming. Written by a mother and daughter who went through life's difficulties together, it offers their precious advice and I think every mother and daughter will relate to that. Very well done!"
4,A Good Summer Read,"If you're looking for a feel good book that's a quick read, then this is the book for you. This book is definitely not in the same league as Seabiscuit or When Pride Mattered, but it's nicely written and tells a good story: the improbably victory of James Braddock. Perfect for summer reading."
5,A Great Book!,"This book is about one of the greatest sports comeback ever. Schaap not only profiles the history of boxing but gives us a quaint look at life during the 1930's depression. Jimmy Braddock, was a washed-up, underdog determined to win the title against one of the greatest boxers ever, Max Baer. Braddock was billed as a 10-to-one underdog. Baer was not onlyheavily favored, but he had already killed two men in the ring. Braddock, with the help of his manager, Joe Gould makes a remarkable comeback and defeats Baer. Braddock becomes a hero and is able to get off welfare once and for all. The story is a hit, even for those who don't like boxing."
3,Just okay...,"First and foremost, I wish they would've chosen a strong singer to star in the movie! Ciara's acting was as below average as her singing! The movie overall was okay!"
5,A Very Meaningful Movie,"This is a sensitive and thoughtful movie about the conflict that may arise when children and parents have ""issues."" The morals are Christian...the acting excellent...with plentyof music and drama for anyone. I recommend it for ages 14 and up..."
2,Mama I want to sing,"I found this movie to be dull and slow paced. I expected more music, especially involving Whitney Houston. I was very disappointed."
3,Traditional storyline,"quite a nice show overall, musically good, at times a little pretencious but as it was based on a true story it couldn't be told any other way"
3,Disappointed,I waited a long time for this movie to come out and it was a disappointment to me. It was just okay.
4,value for the money,"Wanted a movie, for my classroom, for adults with disabilities, this was easy for them to undedrstand. would recommend it."
2,waste of money,"the movie is boring.it plays well,just boring.i donated it to someone.and they didnt like it themselves. i prefer tyler perry movies."
1,Never,I can not rate this DVD for the fact that I never received it. Please have someone track this down for me and I would glad to rate and share a review.
2,Not a great movie,The movie was all over the place. If it weren't for some of the big name then the movie would have been a flop. Not the best movie but the last 10 minutes started to come together. Would not buy again.
5,awesome,I have been waiting for this movie come out it did meet my expectations love this movie . I recommend this movie for everyone to see .
3,Mama I want to Sing,"Couldn't really rate this movie either, because I have not seen it yet. I saw previews, so I brought it."
5,I absolutely loved it!!!,"I had waited a long time for this movie to come out on DVD, but after reading the other reviews I started not to watch it. However, I saw a better preview on another DVD so I decided to rent it on Amazon Instant Video. I enjoyed it so much that I plan to purchase a copy for my collection. Lynn Whitfield's last sermon was very believable and touching. Perhaps, if you've seen the actual play, you may not get what you expect, but if you watch it without the comparison, I think you may enjoy it. All I can say is watch it and judge for yourself."
1,"Mama, I Want To Scream","This has to be the worst movie I have seen in a very, very long time. The movie wastes such great talent, especially Patti LaBelle and Paris Bennett. It was amazing that seasoned actors such as Ben Vereen and Lynn Whitfield, both actors I respect, played cardboard characters that did not propel the movie or the plot.Ciara was as interesting as a dial tone. I take that back. A dial tone would have been more rivetting. Ciara has to be the most poorly cast member of this movie, and that is tragic considering that she is the lead. Her acting (if you wish to call it that) might as well have been phoned in. I tried to give this movie a chance, and I watched it from beginning to end. And that was as poor a choice as putting this film on celluloid."
1,Awful,"I rented this movie from Redbox and the $1.20 I paid was too much. About 20 minutes in my boyfriend and I couldn't take it anymore. Ciara has clearly never acted before and the plot was terrible. Plus, how is the worst singer in the movie the lead--someone explain that one.If you proceed with purchasing this movie, the disappointment is your own fault. You've been warned!"
3,Not the Musical!,"Although this presentation has some delightful merits on its own, it is NOT a faithful depiction of the original Musical as presented on the stage. Some elements have been retained, such as a glimpse of an amazing gospel choir in rehearsal (but greatly abbreviated from the stage version).The acting is decent, and some of the singing is quite rewarding. The basic plot, that of a gospel singer who wants to become a pop superstar (against family objections), is retained. The movie can be enjoyed on its own merits, but should not be considered as a legitimate representation of the Broadway production."
1,Hated it,"Horrible acting, horrible movie, no real storyline, no substance; I should've listened to my co-workers warnings to avoid this movie. I will never get the hour and a half I wasted back."
1,Needed a different title,"This movie was terrible! The acting sounded like a first rehearsal. When I heard a few years ago that the movie was in production, I was surprised that Ciara was chosen as lead. Her voice is not strong enough for the songs. But then I expected the movie was following the script of the stage play. Wrong! The only comparison of this movie to the play was Desiree Coleman, the original Doris Troy, singing ""Not Created to Fall."" Ciara, though easy on the eyes, is no actress. Maybe she acted in plays in her hometown of Riverdale, Ga., but her performance would not cut it in any performing arts high school. Now I understand why this movie went straight to DVD. The storyline was weak. Even though Vy Higgenson, the writer of the stage play, was in the movie, I can't understand why she green lighted this project. Watch this movie on tv. Save your rental money!"
3,My CiCi,"I love my CiCi she is so pretty. Although shes not the best actor, i thought she did a pretty good job! Love U Ci!!"
1,Horrible...,The movie was all over the place.... It was just horrible. They had too many plots going on and none of them seemed to follow through on their supposed intent. I was highly disappointed.
2,slow moving,"Didn't care for this movie very much. It was rater slow moving and so-so acting. Somewhat of a disappointment. I've certainly seen better Lynn Whitfield. This, in my opinion was a waste of her talent. Also, Patti LaBelle had very little to do."
5,great effects,Rated R for Gore thats it. It is tottally bloody. Such as the Ice cream man putting a head on a cone. His origanal name is Greogry and he trys to follow the footsteps of the old icecream man and hes not about to give up. He's funny and he is also seen in my Dog Skip.
3,Ohh Clint,"I've enjoyed watching this movie ever since I was a young teen. It's pretty absurd and hilarious, and is finally on dvd. However, and I don't know if this is just my copy, there are image clitches. Every 4-5 minutes a line pops up for a split second, and near the end of the movie the picture gets completely scattered and distorted for a second. It's nothing really major, but it is distracting and rather annoying. If I had paid $20 + for this item I would get ticked off & exchange it. Who knows, maybe it is just mine. I give the movie itself a 4, and the quality of the disc a 2. So thats 3 stars."
1,One of the worst movies ever,"There were a few really good scenes, however, they were very very few and even farther between. It's not worth buying, perhaps renting if you're in the mood to MST3K a movie. The worst shame was seeing Olivia DeHussey of Romeo and Juliet fame sink to an all-time low as the Nurse. She was way too overtalented for this movie."
1,I've seen better,A high-school kid could make up a better story. Watch out for the Liger! Part Lion part Tiger
1,0 STARS: This is STUPID!,"""Ice Cream Man"" is not scary...it's not funny...it's just plain STUPID. You know, I don't have a problem with an ice cream man that turns into a homicidal maniac...that's not a bad idea. But, they made a joke of this movie. The acting is horrible and the movie sucked to no end."
1,Stay a way from this video......PLEASE!,"this video is so boreing to even watch[...] First of all I never heard of this movie.. so I thought it looked cool and then I bought it. Boy was I wrong.... The PICTURE of this movie was horribal. I had to stand by the TRACKING button to keep the picture ok, the sound of it was very bad also. The 85 minutes of this movie drags on. It seems like its a 3 hour movie that has NO interesting parts at all. My tip is if you bought this movie... then SMASH it with a axe, burn it, then dump the ashes into a fish tank and let the fish eat it!! Dont make a mistake of buying this movie or even renting it. Its not worth the time and the money."
1,Ice cream never tasted this bad.,"Not made for young children!Remember Clint Howard when he was the boy who had a pet grizzly bear ""Gentle Ben"" (1967-69)? Once in a while you will see Clint in one of his brother's (Ron Howard) movies. He also appeared in BLACKWOODS (2002).In this low-budget film, Clint Howard is ""The Ice Cream Man"". Not the first, but of many horror films Mr. Howard has had the pleasure to be in. ""Ice Cream Man"" (1994) is made as a ludicrous comedy and includes a well-known cast of actors: Sandahl Berman, Andrea Evans, Steve Garvey, Olivia Hussey, Doug LLewelyn, Lee Majors II (son of), David Warner, David Naughton and Jan-Michael Vincent.You might never eat ice cream again.You can buy this VHS with the ""Special Bloodless Cover""."
1,Pure Rocky Road Trash!,"I can't believe I watched the whole thing! There are movies that are so bad that they are actually good...well this ain't one of them! These celebs reached an all time low when they signed on for this garbage. Clint Howard, poor, poor, Clint Howard, Ron if you are reading this...get your brother a real acting gig! The acting, story, script, and sountrack are so horrible that in comparison made ""Showgirls"" look pretty darn good! How sad to see people like Olivia Hussey and Jan Micheal Vincent reduced to such slime. The effects, I must admit were fairly good, yet totally twisted. This movie is so pathetic that the movie ""slip cover"" refers to actor David Naughton as Haughton...now that's bad! Trust me, you will look at ice cream very differently after watching this gem!"
4,So bad it's good,"A great B-movie horror flick! This is the boy from ""Gentle Ben"" all grown up - it's Little Richie's bro (Clint Howard). Feeding the cops ice cream with eyeballs, ya gotta love it. Funny and amusing."
3,The book is so concise that the proofs are did in the style 'steps of giant',"To me, it were very hard to read the book because when I followed the proofs I needed to compute several intermediate steps what I don't enjoy.Also the book has proper symbols and its list of symbols is very incomplete."
3,Good but not a complete how-to for learning conversation,"But the title doesnt claim to be. It's an analysis of the importance and what goes on in the very first minutes of meeting someone new. It held my interest somewhat and does really cover some things not mentioned in elsewhere. Considering the book is cheap, for me it was more than worth the price. Occasionally I have come back to the book."
4,Well worth reading,"This book provides excellent insights into how to make a meaningful positive impression on people when you first meet them. It give some valuable specific approaches and indicates why some people fail to make a good impression. I found myself taking a lot of notes while I was reading which is a good sign for me that a book has something valuable to offer. The book also goes well beyond the first four minutes and includes a section on examining your views and behaviors on a wide range of topics. It is a very good ""how to"" book on an important part of life. While is is more than 40 years old it is timeless in its advice."
1,"Great title, dumb book","For much better advice on this topic, try Alan Garner's ""Conversationally Speaking."""
1,These are JUNK,I purchased these for my mustang.I read the reviews and bought them even thou i was skeptical about the quality of them because the price was so low.Well i was wright they are total JUNK they are not even worth the cost of shipping them back.If you are looking to throw your money away then buy them but other than that dont waste your time or money.They should not be allowed to sell JUNK like this.I only gave one star because you cant give them none.I hooked them up and could not even hear them until i put my ear up to them and then all i heard was noise not even close to what you would expect to hear from a tweeter.Any body that says these even work is ether def or lying.
2,crappy tweeters,dont recommend these. very poor sound you can barely hear them. they blew the first day. i got the power acoustic nb's the same time i ordered these. power acoustic's sound way better and havent gave me any problems.
4,good tweeters for the price,"These tweeters were a replacement for a set of vifa tweeters that i had. I needed a replacement for the vifas due to size constraints, the vifas while they sound great were 2 1/2 inches and would not fit in the window sill were the side view mirrors are mounted, but these little BOSS TW-15 tweeeters were perfect and they swivel for better staging and direction of highs. They sound good, maybe not as good as the vifas which cost three times as much, but with a wider range of placement applications due to its size (1 1/2 inches) and it's ability to swivel although minimal one can direct the highs, and the highs are more directional sensetive then say the a midrange or a subwoofer. In general its sound quality is good, mounting options are great and price per performance can't be beat"
1,garbage bags are a better deal,"These tweeters are junk. I got them in a swift manner and a cheap price, but cheap is what they are. One of them didnt even work! I have no time for returns and exchanges, so I thank God it was under ten bucks total. From one audio lover to you....DO NOT BUY THESE"
4,Great for the price,"They work great sound better then the stock, but docent seem like the bass blockers are working. over all i would buy again, been using them for a few months now"
3,"Not his best work so far, still OK","This is an OK album, but if you expect the same level of innovation found in One Starry Night, then I would advise you to listen to the track samples before buying. A couple of tracks are very good (This Night is my favorite), but overall you'll find a lot of repetitive loops across several tracks, and that old piano sound which I found a bit passe' for deep house."
4,I really liked the movie.,"I haven't seen much alien nation movies, actually, this is the first I have seen. After I saw the movie, I went to the video club and hired an other alien nation video. I think it is an inspiring story. I do not wish to ruin the movie for all those who wish to see the video. I liked it because of it's many unexpected plot turns, and the way the problems were solved. and ofcourse, if you don't know alien nation, a little mystery from the unknown. the strange language, the alien culture. that was wat I liked about the movie. I could recomend it to anyone."
4,Is this a good movie? Yes.,"If you liked the ""Alien Nation"" t.v. series (and I can't imagine why you wouldn't), then you will like this movie because it finishes all of the questions that were left unanswered when the idiot network cancelled the series. However, I only gave it 4 stars because parts of it are a little disjointed and because of the four made for t.v. movies that they made after the series ended, this one is my least favorite. If you want to see an absoulute fabulous movie about the alien nation series, then you should watch ""The Udara Legacy"". It's REALLY cool. Also, there were several books that were written to continue the stories (some of them from the writters who worked on the series), and of those I HIGHLY recommend ""Extreme Prejudice"". I always wanted them to turn that book into a made for T.V. movie."
3,factory warranty,"I have had my RZ24G desktop for 7 months and recently the dial up modem got a problem:it became so slow that it would take approx 15 min or much longer or sometimes wouldnot login due to 18kbps or under .My other PC works well using the same phone line(HP desktop).I tried with all of my know-how but was unable to solve this problem,I called Sony and was shocked when The on line Agent told me that if I needed any warranteed work on my computer,I would have to somehow send it to San Diego,CA (I am not sure who would pay for shipping cost).I live in Bay Area,about 400 miles away fr San Diego.I am quite dissappointed after I found out how Sony warranties its products .If I ever buy Sony Products again,I would certainly look into purchasing an In-store-warranty ,which I know this means an additional cost of 10 to 20% to the purchased price and this is probably good for 3 years."
4,Great CD,"This album featuring Edwin (of I Mother Earth fame) feature him with a full band. Great cd! Superhoney, Split the Atom are great rock tunes. Let's Dance is a great song as well. If you're a fan of Edwin, you'll love this cd"
4,"Decent acting, good storyline and brilliant ending!",I would personally have to recommend this movie for any fan of mafia movies. The reason for this is because it has some decent acting with an unusal storyline when it concerns your average mafia tough guy on the run from the mob. I don't want to get into too many details as I'd hate to spoil the movie for you if you are planning to watch this. This is a straight to video release and in my own opinion I think if there was some more spice added to the film...Crosscut might've made it to the cinema.
4,Wonderful Features and Great Picture,"I love the features of this VCR, especialy the automatic commercial advance. The VCR marks the beginning and end of commercials and then automatically fast forwards through them on playback. A time-shifter's dream! I previously reviewed this as 3 stars because it was incompatible with my new Panasonic HDTV set. I found out that the TV was the problem, not the VCR. Now that I have hooked it up to my Sony XBR HDTV, I am very pleased with my purchase."
1,Clunky and hard to use,"Positives, puts out good video. I purposely bought a TV and VCR from the same manufacturer to simplify remote control problems. I will not buy from panasonic again. The VCR remote can control the TV, but there are two vcr/tv buttons, they do different things, but it isn't obvious or intuitive when to use which one. This machine has a lot, and I mean a lot of buttons on the remote. The VCR has no RCA video jack out, but it does have one for video in and there is no explanation for this from customer service. There are an endless list of illogical inconsistencies with this machine. Unless you want complications in your life, avoid this machine.Overall, I recommend you avoid this machine, unless you like looking through manuals to figure out what button to push for what. The video output is nice though, can you tell I'm trying to be positive."
2,This machine is psychotic,"I only bought this machine because it has 4 hour recording capability. That's the only thing going for it with me. Theauto tracking causes more trouble than its worth. There's a dreadful hum with my prerecorded tapes, worse with some than others. It also chews tapes-they were both T-160s but this thing's predecessor an RCA-ProScan that I had for over 7 years before it went the way of all good things never did that no matter what brand of tape I put in"
1,Not worth even the bargain price,"It shuts itself off after 10 minutes of recording, and sometimes randomly during playback too. Also operation is very noisy."
3,"well, some of its okay","I had to stop using SP recording & use only LP or SLP as SP became too grainy after a couple of months. This makes a lot of noise on rewind! The remote has buttons not compatible with multiremotes. The some remote buttons are tiny-- as people have said. Its a pretty cheap vcr now & its the only one I could find with commercial advance other than the go video vcr which is a lot more. Programming it is a drag because you have to hit up/down every time for each minute or hour. I suppose mind needs a cleaning, which I can do to get recording back in SP speed. Fair enough, but there is nothing I can do about the noise on rewind. The buttons on front are larger than usual. The front lcd display shows more than just nbrs, it shows PLAY, REC, etc so you know what its doing., But if you hear a loud whirrrrrrrrr youll know its rewinding without looking at the display. It's not compatible with my Guide Plus feature either, grrrrrrrr!....."
4,Panasonic VCR,I had a VCR for a long time and it finally went out. I was so glad to find one that I didn't need to throw away my new DVD players for. It works great and am having fun watching my videos again. Thanks
4,Nice VCR,"I purchased this VCR to replace my several year old Panasonic one. The biggest difference is the sound. I love good sound effect, and the PV-V4621 is great! It integrates very well into my home theater system with nice Dolby 5.1 . I'm not sure if the picture quality is much better than my old one though. The playback of recorded TV program seems grainy, a little worse than expected. The noise during rewinding is way too loud, but the action was fast. The VCR plus feature is great. Overall, a good VCR in this price range."
4,"Beautiful, High Quality, but Very Small","I absolutely love these scarves. I ordered the stripes and the polka dots. The print is beautiful, the silk is nice quality, but the scarves are so tiny! I should have double checked since the measurements are indeed listed on the product page... They still work fine and look wonderful when worn, but unless $20 is insignificant to you, just know for sure what you'll be getting for the money. :) Thankfully, they only charged me the $5 shipping once even though I ordered two scarves. Nice!"
5,"Inventive, sophisticated mix of styles -- magnificent guitar","These guys are really international and you can hear it -- jazz, middle eastern, Caribbean -- they have picked up from many styles and made something of their own. This is great listening!"
1,The Borrowers,"Quite honestly, this looked like somebody had taken a video camera, and videotaped this movie while it was being played from a VCR. It was absolutely terrible. I was very disappointed."
2,DEFINITELY NOT DIGITALLY REMASTERED!,"This DVD version of The Borrowers has NOT been digitally remastered, no matter what they say on the cover. It is simply a out and out lie. The color is horrible and the film is extremely grainy. I would still recommend it because it is the only ""classic"" version available. I'm looking forward to the longer (and better) version with Ian Holm to be released on DVD."
1,"Great story, horrible dvd!!","Why this is called ""digitally remastered"" I'll never know. Both the sound and the picture were just plain bad. The price is right, but you certainly get what you pay for with this dvd. There's a novel idea called ""truth in advertising"", and this dvd is not advertised truthfully."
3,"It's a poor video quality DVD, but it's not the actors fault.","It states ""The Borrowers (Digitally Remastered)"", but it's far from Remastered. Don't blame the actors for the poor video quality, the actors did their jobs well enough long before DVD's were a technology. This version on DVD looks like someone copied an old well used decades old VHS tape directly to DVD. The movie is simple clean entertainment for children, but the quality of the video on this particular DVD is poor and unenjoyable."
1,Borrowers that Steal,"Borrowers (1973)This product was mailed and delivered promptly, as agreed by the seller. However, the product itself was terrible. I didn't like this one at all. There was absolutely no substance to the story line. Even the version starring John Goodman was better than this one.When comparing the one starring Eddie Albert to the version starring Ian Holm, THERE IS NO COMPARISON. The one with Ian Holm was excellent family viewing, and as an adult, I even view it alone. I love it."
2,Could not have been digitally remastered,"I agree with the other reviewers. This is one of the worst prints I have ever seen on DVD. There are three crisp clear pictures from the film on the back of the case. Unfortunately you will never see anything like that in the video. The colors are muddy and muted throughout the film.This is all a sad thing because it is a classic film from Hallmark Hall of Fame and deserves a much better presentation than what it got from ""Digivew Products"" I would suggest avoiding anything with their name on it. I know I will. And unless you REALLY want this film, I can not suggest you buy it in it's current form."
2,A Bad Representation of a Good Movie,"I have liked this movie from the time I was little so was really excited when Amazon had it. When it came in the male, though, the excitement was for nothing. The sound quality and picture on this DVD are the worst I have ever seen. I never watched it again after the first time."
4,Good Product -wrong choice,"My wife had a pair of West County gloves which she loved, kept her hands warm in winter, were waterproof, had a soft liner which didn't chaffe her knuckles, and had good gripping ability. She uses them to work outside in the winter, taking care of bird feeders, handling bird baths, driving, etc. She completely wore them out, right throught the leather tipped fingers. However, this West County glove was not what she had. This glove is not warm, and not waterproof. I found out that the glove she wanted is called the womens waterproof glove by West County. She has decided to keep these to wear in the spring and summer when working outside and in the garden. So right now, cannot evaluate these gloves properly, and will have to wait till they have been in full use."
5,Best Gardening Gloves Available,"These gloves have everything: made from recycled materials, leather palms reinforced at stress points, velcro wrist strap so dirt doesn't get in--even a terry cloth thumb for wiping your brow. Since I've found them, I don't use anything else."
3,Excellent quality but does not fit smaller hands,"To echo the other reviews, these gloves are clearly of excellent quality. The fabric is durable/well-stitched and the composition (breathable, yet protective against thorns) is nicer than any other glove I've tried. Unfortunately while the gloves may be of good fit for the large sizes, the gloves do not seem to fit smaller hands. There is about 1/4-1/2"" of space left at the tips of each of the fingers which increases to about 3/4"" space when my fingers are bent (ie when grasping something). Because I lose the fine motor control of having fingertips, I then have a difficult time wearing these when doing any yard work that is not pulling very large weeds or pruning large branches. Not to mention your hands become quite clumsy with 1/2"" of excess material at their tips. So for those with small hands, I recommend to keep looking."
4,Worth the price,"This item was one of the best choices we made at this holiday season, my 6-yr-old granddaughter loves it. With the reviews that I'd read, we took the pieces out of box immediately to set about getting it together. The pieces went together with no problems, and using wood glue along with the screws sent made the house even more secure. It is permanently put together, but we hope she'll have years of enjoyment out of it. The only issue is that the pieces sent to be used as flooring were warped, so do not stay flat in the house. And we all wonder why there is only one staircase section, (on the outside of the middle floor), but her imagination got her over that quickly enough. Though the piece is most definitely worth the price, finding furniture for the scale was difficult and the pieces we did find were expensive."
1,"If I no Like, You Should No like This. This bad bad BAD!","This no toy no good. It break when they got it. Now i am sad sadSAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!yes, we are all sad because this thingymabobber ruined ourCrhistmas (not really, but the people not happy) so look howmany sad faces had been made? This item, possess the darkside!Dang, how do those people make crap and get paid?BAD! BAD! BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Bye Bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,giant garbage pile,"My daughter has been asking for a large dollhouse since she was 4 but we waited until we knew she would be able to take care of it and use it properly. We finally decided on this dollhouse and when we got it we found the thing is made of cardboard and particle board with very few actual braces made of real wood. There isn't enough hardware to keep the thing together and it broke almost immediately despite very gentle use by my mature seven-soon to be eight- year old. She was devastated. I found a much better dollhouse by Imaginarium that is almost the same price as this. To me the extra 10.00 is worth it knowing that my daughter will have a dollhouse she can actually USE. Please don't buy this dollhouse, you will be dissapointed. Instead check out the Glitter Dreams Dollhouse or the Uptown Dollhouse both by Imaginarium."
1,"Wished I'd Read The Reviews- ""Junk"" is the right word","Yes, I bought this enormous dollhouse- I saw the low price, and thought ""how cool"" : the dollhouse I never had growing up. Reviewers are right- it's total junk. It's made mostly of particle board, and apparently cheap particle board at that. You really can't move it, as folks said, it starts to come apart. So, I would suggest looking elsewhere- I think Hearthsong might have a nice wooden dollhouse"
1,Be prepared to rebuild,"Very disappointed with the quality. Took 2 hours to put together then disintegrated as I was carrying it from the shop to the christmas tree. I was not happy having to put it back together early Christmas morning. Be prepared to use extra tape, glue, nails and screws to hold the contraption together. The stairway is a joke and I threw it away as it is only held in with two 3/4"" pegs. We'll see if it survives Christmas Day."
1,Flimsy trash,This doll house is so flimsy and badly constructed you cannot even pick it up to move it without pieces of it falling off. Save yourmoney or spend alittel more for a better constructed one.
1,Do not buy,"Stay away. Bought this as a christmas present and couldn't even put the thing together. The wood was so warped that it wouldn't even hold the floors. And the ""floors"" do not seem sturdy at all. Just card board that seems like it would break easily. Got it because it was on sale at a great price, but I'd rather pay more for a decent quality product"
2,"Review of quality of Kindle version, not content!","I was so excited when I saw this book was available on the Kindle and for such a low price! Thank goodness I downloaded the sample first. I was confused from the first line:""Introduction Woman as Other FOR a long time I have hesitated to write a book on woman.""It took me a while to figure out it should have read:""IntroductionWoman as OtherFor a long time ...""I was turned off already. But I went a few more pages and found more errors. ""Tou think thus and so because you are a woman."" Is that ""You"" or ""To""??I can't purchase this book if this is how it will be throughout. Who knows what other errors there are. As another reviewer stated, it looks like the text was scanned in and not even edited. I've read other Kindle books and they were of much better quality. I'm so disappointed."
1,Kindle version is a rip-off,"Obviously de Beauvoir's book is essential reading, and this was the first time I thought I would read a long book on kindle for iphone, buying this before a book group discussion of The Second Sex. But as other reviewers (whom I should have looked at before!) have noted, you only get a fraction of the book. Pretty basic problem for the Kindle, and not as advertised."
3,Second Sex,It arrived without a dust cover; wish this had been mentioned in its billing. I'll be looking for another copy...
5,Second sex,"Its good to read this book translated by a woman. I had a very old copy but i have never read it due to very poor translation. The concept and ideas are not obsolete, still accurate for some countries like my country.The ideas and cases in the book can also be used for comparing conditions then and now and how society changes rapidly. Most things considered taboo then seems normal to us now.Overall i say its a must read for every woman and men who wants to enhance their vision. Modern classic."
4,Good,This book is good for teaching philosophy. It is not what I thought it would be at all which was good and it had a lot of good points.
2,The Kindle edition includes only part I,"(The rating is for the Kindle edition of the book ONLY. If Amazon permitted posting without rating, that would have been ideal.)Part I of the book is about 1/8 the actual text. (Kindle edition also includes intro and book's conclusion.)Also, kindle edition appears to have been scanned and OCR'd, and the OCR often guesses wrong. Caveat Emptor."
4,Canonical but a bit overwhelming,"A verifiable monster of a book, The Second Sex is an extraordinarily important work in the development of contemporary feminism, but it cannot be lightly tackled. Although there are excellent chapters that cover specific situations, specifically periods within a woman's life, the book as a whole is a bit thick and dense to digest in one sitting, even if that sitting were to last an entire semester. Instead, most people I have spoken to recommend reading just De Beauvoir's introduction and one or two chapters that are relevant to an individual project. I would have to pass along the same recommendation."
1,Kindle Edition has some major issues.,"1. The Kindle edition is not actually the full text. In fact, it is not even a decent abridgment of the full text--it's a very brief excerpt, with only the introduction and the first part (the shortest out of seven parts). There was no indication in the product description that this was not an the full book, which is pretty deceptive.2. What there _is_ of the text is very poorly formatted, to the point of unreadability.I can't comment on _The Second Sex_ itself, since I now have to wait for a real copy to read anything of it, but don't waste your money on the Kindle edition."
2,The Second Sex,"This book has proved to be ground breaking in the feminist movement. However, it seems to reinforce social roles under gender categories, which is the last thing any gender (male or female) movement needs. It reinforces gender roles by outcasting one and accepting the other. It is an interesting read but one that should be taken with a grain of salt."
1,Worse than the First Translation,"This translation conveys the same message as the first translation, but is unnecessarily wordy, uses longer complicated sentence structure and is a struggle to get through. It seems to be a literal translation and also uses French terminology with no footnotes to explain their meaning to the English reader. All this book demonstrates is that the decades of criticism surrounding the first translation was unfounded & based in ignorance (no big surprise there).Does contain a great quote though: ""Scandinavians are healthy, strong, and cold. ""Fiery"" women are those who combine their languor with ""fire,"" like Italian or Spanish women,""Oh how true it is."
3,LED lights,Its worth what you pay for. Not very bright so dont expect something eye catching. I have them in my license plate but not bright enough
4,Bobby's World Swim by me VHS,"If you remember Howie Mandel's ""Bobby's World"" series, then you likely will enjoy ""Swim by me"" and ""Jets, Choo-choos, & Cars"", the two episodes on this tape. My kindergartner likes these today as much as my oldest boy enjoyed them on TV back in the late 80's, early 90's. The music can be a bit lame at times, but the humor is timeless. My youngest was quick to point out that they didn't wear bike helmets back then, so we got in a safety discussion to boot. These old tapes are often cheaper than the shipping cost, so they are a bargain, too. I and my boy liked it!"
1,Franklin Covey RIP,"Franklin Planner 7.1 was to upgrade Ascend 4 that I'd been using since 1995. The new program has only a subset of the features the older program had. Ascend 4 worked great, but recent changes in my work Windows XP environment was causing Ascend to be terminated at odd times. The new program comes with converters for Ascend 5 AND for Ascend 4, except the Ascend 4 converter is missing one 16 bit .DLL file. Calls to Covey only resulted in ""We no longer support this software"". One .DLL, that's all I needed. My last Franklin Covey software. If I'm to manually enter my info from Ascend 4 into another program, it won't be any of theirs!"
5,Good if you know what it's meant to do,"If your familiar with recent software you will like this planner, it's not too complicated and is very helpful and useful."
4,great find...,I generally buy my books for the dessert recipes. This was no exception. It has some dolci that I find interesting and unique. I started with the Lemon Rosemary Pound Cake and it was fabulous. It has a fluffy moist tender crumb that we swooned over. Well worth the price of the book.I also tried a couple of other dishes and was not impressed...but still know there is a lot of great cooking to do from this book.
4,"""southern"" Italian at its best",The book I received was obviously a library book and in excellent condition although it was graded much lower.I watched these guys years ago on TV and really enjoyed them. This book is a little bit of a surprise because it half Southern Italian and half Southern American recipes. I'm really happy to have both.
3,Looking for this tape,"Hello, I'm a new fan of this series and I'm trying to get this episode on tape without spending a fortune. If you can help please leave a message at this site. I will check back. This is a great series, I think they should rerun it!"
5,Greenspan's Early Beliefs,"This is the best of Rand's non-fiction. In addition, it contains two articles by Alan Greenspan. Most strangely, in ""Gold and Economic Freedom"", he argues that the federal reserve is unnecessary, immoral, founded on a misunderstanding of economics, distructive to freedom and wealth, exists primarily to support chronic deficit spending and the welfare state, and was the cause of the great depression. That's right, our current Fed Head!"
5,A must read for American voters,"This book provides the reader with the intellectual background to understand the basis of America's principles of liberty and economics. It also gives insight into what has insidiously crept into the America envisioned by our forefathers, which has implications on the problems America is faced with today. This is the kind of book that should be mandatory in high school and college. This book will reinforce what it is to be American and why we should take pride in the American culture and heritage."
5,Propaganda?,"The only ""outlandish piece of propaganda"" about this book is the Library Journal's unabashed hit-piece pseudo-review of it on this website. The essence of capitalism is a political-economic system based on individual rights where all property is owned privately. If you wish to engage in thought about the authentic meaning of capitalism, read Ayn Rand's articles in this book, then if you decide to reject capitalism for statism, do so with the full knowledge of what capitalism is and be prepared to take the consequences for selling your soul."
5,Great set of essays.,"This book changed the way I look at the world and influenced me to become an economist. Check out Alan Greenspan's article about the gold standard, funny considering he became chief of the fed."
1,Pseudo-economics,"I'm delighted that what's left of Ayn Rand's teaching is slowly rotting away as people in general becomes more educated. No, and I mean no real economist takes her propagandistic writings seriously anymore, except as ""lightly read pulp sci-fi"" for confused teenagers. In her book, Capitalism, there is no empirics to support her views. The theoretical reasoning reveals a shocking ignorance of real economic theory. Basically this is a worthless piece of junk!"
1,A right-wing fantasy masquerading as a radical indictment,"Answer this question: If Rand endorses capitalism as an equal opportunity reward system for innovators & industrialists, then someone explain inheritance to me. Great grandchildren of William R. Hearst are given a greater economic opportunity than the grandchildren of a mechanic, enabled by the STATE (the same state she blames for all problems) Rand never acknowledges this and her whole theory subsequently crumbles. Rand is popular with adolescents desperate to reconcile their confusion about self-interest and duties and ""Libertarian"" apologists looking for a theory to justify domination and exploitation. I find it fitting that a woman who praises capitalism as the ""unknown (unkown to whom?) ideal"" also goes to great lengths to explore rape fantasies in The Fountainhead. Read Noam Chomsky or George Orwell, please."
1,Novelist's fantasy,"Consulting Ayn Rand about economics is like consulting Edgar Rice Burroughs about astronomy. She wasn't interested in the scientific truth - only in her ""exalted vision of man"" (John Galt cf. John Carter)."
1,speling is'nt impotent,"thaks to that other reveiwer who said speling is'nt impotent, capatilism is the gratest sistem ever weather or not we spel it write. but he said second-handers was gonna be the tittle of the fountainhead, he is rong it was gonna be second hand lives.anyway we sure do got to form concepts, i think thats way more impotent then lerning to spel write. capatilism is teriffic and if you do'nt like this book you are a SECOND HANDED."
1,Silly,"With ""defenders"" of capitalism like Ayn Rand, who needs enemies. This isn't really philosophy kids."
4,Solid and In-Depth Study,"This series of essays goes to great depth in studying the foundations of capitalism and its relationship to human freedom. There are also wonderful essays about politics of the 50's and 60's and their relationship to freedom.Some issues, however, are explored almost exclusively from a moral perspective, and only incidently address economic issues.The biggest problem is that the writing style is very harsh, which gets old after a while.Still this is a very good book for exploring capitalism and freedom."
1,It Didn't Work,"In its time, Rand's vision was intoxicating. We are now living in a reality where big business pretty much influences everything in our lives, and the society that it has produced isn't exactly what Rand envisioned. The idea of an unrestrained capitalism sounds wonderful as a philosophy. But in truth, it's just as dangerous as total government control: Exxon Mobil, Walmart, etc. are not businesses, but institutions with power over our every day lives. I don't think that this is the world that Rand intended, but it's the outcome of her philosophy. Her efforts, while noble, have proven to be a failure."
2,Rebuttal,See Dr. John Robbins' Without a Prayer: Ayn Rand and the Close of Her System for a scholarly rebuttal to Objectivism.
1,Bogus,"Stupidity in it's purest form. Introduces a concept of ""freedom"" which is truly perverse. How anyone who labels himself an ""anarchist"" (what a non-sense -ism...)believes there exists individual freedom in a society controlled by global corporations is truly a mystery."
1,Moral Degradation,"This book is typical Ayn Rand. Written by a Nazi, for other Fascists to read. The only ""moral"" people upheld by Rand, are the Old Family Bankers, who have given us a nearly constant state of war somewhere in the World. The founding morals of this Nation were destroyed when a National Banking system took over. Our Nation will continue to disentegrate, both economically and morally, so long as other Fascist hail her concentration camp (Prison Industries)mentality. Each Citizen should be afraid when they realize that this Philosophy and ""voodoo economics"" is being propagated by a similar little brain, ie. George Bush, Bill Clinton. Read and beware, for they are gaining in power, and then the full realization of their fallacy will be brought to bear on the heads of the people."
4,greenspan,this book with its essays by greenspan show a good example of a guy who used to fight against courruption & the federal reserve and then sold out to those who battled against.Our money was taken from us in the middle of the night by corrupt bankers. The federal Reserve is bogus.
4,Capitalism and Morality,"The first thing you should know before buying this book is that it is a book of philosophy, not an economic treatise. In a nutshell, Rand defends Capitalism as the most moral system because it is the only one that fully respects property rights. Without property rights, no other rights are possible, and most of our economic and social problems stem from violations of individual and property rights.Most of the criticisms of this book overlook the fundamental theme. It is very possible you may not care for the way Rand presents her arguments, or dislike certain terms she uses. But if you don't like the salesman's presentation, don't blame the merchandise.Rand's views were highly influenced by the Austrian School of thought in economics, so if it is an economic treatise you're looking for, I suggest you start with the writings of Ludwig Von Mises, F.A. Hayek, or Murray Rothbard."
5,Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal,"After communist regime after communist regime has collapsed around the world, while the capitalistic countries have prospered and been there to assist the victims of communism time and time again, how many people really understand WHY? That understanding is a matter of life and death, and this book explains it and why."
5,It's a jolly little book.,"I read this book when I was a kid, and remembered its jolliness and simple hilarity. I know that today's modern whiz kids don't go in for that sappy stuff from the '70's, but you know, maybe a 1st or 2nd grader might tolerate it.The premise is fairly simple--a little girl gets her father to purchase a guinea pig for her at the pet store, and the entire story is actually told through the eyes of this furry little creature, who somehow has the name of ""Olga da Polga"" !It really is an endearing book, and people who enjoy simple yet engaging stories probably would get a kick out of it.The original version is the best."
4,howlingly funny - marsh at her best,"For Ngaio Marsh fans, this book is a must. The usual deft and scathing descriptions of small-town characters had me rolling on the floor. I can never play the Rachmaninoff opening bars again without collapsing in laughter. Tight plot, smoothly balanced progression to a classic Marsh finish. The book includes a sweet romantic sub-plot, handled nicely. Beware, if you are particularly sensitive about remarks that make fun of spinsters, you may not find this book as funny as I did."
4,Top of the genre.,"An example of Marsh at her best (although not in the top 5, hence the 4 star rating) it contains every element that's wonderful about the Inspector Alleyn series.Originally published in 1939, OTD is set in a town run roughshod over by a pair of bloody-minded spinsters. When one of them is killed in a particularly fitting way, it's all to easy to find someone who'd be willing to kill both. Alleyn has to sort the prejudice from the truth to catch a killer in this remarkable classic mystery."
4,Start of an appealing series,"Alien Taste is one of the better science fiction I have read in the last two years. The story has depth. It has an appealing protagonist, a riveting plot and a colourful supporting cast. I am glad there are more to come. I wanted to give 5 stars but I am just irked by the writing style which has much to be desired. I hope Spencer would strive to improve her English. I am not asking for classic literature standard but the flow of words could be much better. Will definitely follow the series."
2,Very Disappointing,"The book was a big disappointment.Highly hyped and recommended.The story fizzled quickly and the characters were duds.If I could say anything about the book, it would be that some really neat ideas were ruined by uncompelling writing."
5,Enjoyable Read,"I picked up my roommate's copy and stayed up far too late to finish this book. Spencer does a marvelous job of combining the weird with the mundane so everything is believeable. Ukiah Oregon, despite his non-human roots, is remarkably identifiable and likeable as our hero. His discovery into his extraterrestial origins goes beyond the stereotype into something remarkably fresh and interesting. And he's sexy and adventurous, which doesn't hurt either.Even more than having a remarkable hero, Spencer has managed to craft an interesting supporting cast to run along side Ukiah. I can see where Max and he have a deep friendship that would transcend even Ukiah's personal challenges. The story itself has just enough bite of mystery and intrigue that kept me firmly glued to the book until I finished it.I should probably thank Wen for adding ""I've lost a mouse somewhere"" to my vocabulary among my friends."
4,Original idea!!!,"It seems so hard to find a truly original idea now a days. Luckily Wen Spencer found one! ALIEN TASTE is truly original. At first glance one might think it's just a story about a wolf boy but it goes way beyond that. Way beyond. The characters are interesting and well written. Much like Ukiah's missing memories that return, the underlying storyline creeps up at you slowly, giving you mere hints of what is truly happening. The ending will surprise you, the characters will draw you in, the book will end too soon."
5,"Meet Mowgli, the wolfboy alien!","I was pleasantly surprised by how this book sucked me in and held my interest from start to finish. Ukiah Oregon is certainly a character that you develop a sympathetic bond with, and the depths of his ""alien-ness"" only make him more human in the end. I really liked the way his character developed, along with the friendship with his partner Max, and his family relationships. The relationship with Indigo Zheng, the female FBI agent, was not convincing, and somehow seemed gratuitous, but all told it is a great read."
3,alien Taste,"I bought this because I loved the elfhome series. A well written story, just didn't like it as well as Elfhome."
1,Only one 1/2 hour routine,"The instruction, instructor, and class are all OK, upbeat and good models. However, I was prepared for an hour of yoga, and maybe a second routine for the next day. The DVD has only one, 1/2 hour routine. It would have cost them very little to add another one or two 1/2 hour lessons to the tape. I feel seriously gypped and taken advantage of.For the $20 price you can get a lot more. I recommend ""Yoga for Caregivers"". It has many more poses, several lessons, is 140 minutes long, is safe and gentle, is effective, and costs under $10 on Amazon."
3,chair yoga,I love Jodi Stolove's chair exercise program -- not keen on the Yoga. Maybe I am just not there yet. It is the same quality of the other products.
4,Best candy from childhood,Neccos were probably one of my favorite candies as a kid. I found some in a drugstore recently and was surprised to see them still around. I then found out what a long history they had and decided to buy some in quantity. They taste just as good as I remember.
5,Tasty sugary treats,"These candies are yummy! They're like Pringles: once you pop, you can't stop! I think we've gone through about half of the rolls in two months..."
5,Tastes Just Like the 1950's,"I was paying $1.29 a roll for this candy and it's my ""go-to"" at night watching TV. So I ordered a box, which makes it much cheaper by the roll. My biggest concern was whether or not it would arrive in good condition, or if the wafers would be broken. The box arrived in perfect condition. There are destinctly more flavors in these rolls of candy than the ones I was purchasing at the store. These have the pinks, greens, yellows, grays and whites and taste just like I remember them from many, many years ago. This is a really good buy."
2,"Definitely NOT the ""Original"" Necco","My order arrived promptly but unfortunately NECCO decided to change the recipe of a long time favorite and their new ""original"" wafer is not at all like the true ""original"". The true original had great flavor and color, the new original is tasteless and faded pastel colors. Necco should re-label their new recipe product to avoid confusion."
1,Disappointed!,"A couple of people commented that this candy is the same ORIGINAL product as the ones many of us remember from our childhood. It is NOT! I just received mine, and was expecting the same delightful taste from my childhood in the late 40's...I'm extremely disappointed! The colors are faded, and there is virtually no flavor at all! The packaging reads ""original"", which I find to be false advertising. This is NOT the original Necco wafers that I grew up with, or that I ate just a couple of years ago. Very sad indeed!"
3,"Necco is great, but these are missing 3 flavors","Delicious as always, these packs are missing the orange, green, and purple wafers described above. I was really disappointed - it's in the photo, now that I look at it, but I didn't notice it when I ordered. I suppose that's why the price is so good compared to what you can get off the Necco website directly.Anyway, they're still delicious, arrived in pristine form, but just so you know what you're ordering! :)"
5,Necco Assorted Original Candy Wafers 24 rolls,Necco Assorted Original Candy Wafers 24 rolls. Packed very well. Shipped promptly. Product had no broken pieces which is a plus! Great flavors. Thank you!
4,Overall fair and well constructed look at the 17th President,Treffousse's look at the 17th President of the United States is a fair and well-balanced look at this driven politician. The reader will be left with little doubt that Johnson's racism was his biggest flaw in both his political and personal life. The impeachment is featured but does not dominate the book as it should not.
3,"Not bad, but skips too much","Not a bad book, but it had some serious drawbacks. One is the convoluted manner in which the author covered Johnson's presidential years. You need to keep a list nearby to keep track of who was who and in which party, etc. (Democrats, Republicans, Unionists, Whigs, Conservatives, etc.) Also, the author gives painstaking details about the most trivial things, but when it comes to a female assassin stalking Johnson in the White House, he mentions it in passing (doesn't even devote a full sentence to this event), and moves on. I don't need to know the make and model of stagecoach Johnson rode in, but I would like to hear about the fistfights he engaged in (another tale just glossed over by the author). The finest chapter was the one leading up to Johnson's becoming Lincoln's running mate. None of us will ever see a Republican choose a Democrat as his running mate, but that is what Lincoln did, and it was fascinating to see how it developed. I give the author credit for that."
5,Fascinating and well-written novel!,"Sparkling dialogue and a compelling, intelligent love story set against the turmoil of Athens during WWII combine to make Daysof Atonement a thoroughly enjoyable and unforgettable read. I dearly love Greece and am enthralled by tales of heroism and intrique set during WWII. The author of this lovely novel delivers on both counts. I highly recommend Days of Atonement--it is a story that will linger long after the last page is turned."
5,Not Regina,"Easy reading, historical fiction of early Anabaptist church persecution and beliefs during the Great Reformation. The story centers around Regina as she struggles to understand why some would willingly disobey the state church in order to follow what they believe is Biblical teaching. Has several true historical events woven into the plot."
4,Printable protocols?,"Hello! Still reading this book, but can't find the printable PDF versions of the 5K, 10K, and half protocols (as stated on page 25 of the book). Am I missing something?"
3,A Good Beginner;s Guide,This is a good beginner's guide as it give you options for your level of experience.
4,great for beginners,I bought this book to help me train for my first half-marathon. I found it very useful with lots of information. It is very simple and easy to read while still providing good techinical information. I feel that I will be very well prepared for my half marathon in the spring!
4,"Quality, but not user-friendly","The performance and picture quality of this unit are all up to Panasonic's usual standards. You won't be disappointed. However, if you are one of the many people who have trouble programming a VCR, skip this unit. The remote is used for all TV and VCR functions with the tiny buttons serving dual purposes. The layout is not intuitive or user-friendly. I usually have no problem using electronics but I find myself taking more time than necessary to program this unit. In its defense, this is our alternate VCR/TV and thus it isn't used to often. Maybe with more use it would get easier. Four stars only because of issues mentioned."
2,Beware,"I purchased this tv/vcr combo for my teenage daughter, and we really liked it at first. The size, good quality tv picture, and the FM radio were all nice features. However, after only about 6 weeks of use, the vcr started to mangle tapes. Several of our tapes were ruined, and would no longer play. Maybe this was a fluke, but I would not buy another one of this brand of tv/vcr."
2,Do yourself a favor...buy another brand.,"I am very disappointed in this product. I purchased the unit less than three months ago and can no longer use the VCR portion because the VCR heads are so dirty. I record everyday and had no idea the VCR heads were dirty until I went to playback a tape. All I saw was snow and a blue screen message telling me the VCR heads needed cleaning. After going out and purchasing the recommended VCR Head Cleaner tape per the manual, the problem is not fixed. I then called Panasonic directly and was told I would have to bring the unit it to have it repaired. As the 90 day free labor has expired, it is going to cost me more to have the unit repaired than I originally paid for it.I was pleased with the unit's performance up until today. I previously owned an RCA 13"" combo, using the VCR portion everyday for almost six years without a problem. I am shocked and disappointed in Panasonic."
1,Disappointing,"If you're one of these sad youngsters who just can't abide watching a black & white film, then I guess this one's for you. Otherwise, there's no reason in the world to choose this over the far superior Peter Brook version."
2,old version was better,"This film is completly stupid compared to the book, its as if they concentrated mainly on the gore and swearing, when they don't manage to get the main point across about the darkness of a man's heart. If I were you, i would buy the older version, it makes it much more real.."
1,Horrible Adaptation,"I was really looking forward to this movie simply because the book was amazing. Was I ever wrong. This has to be the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie. I felt like I was watching a play. The plot was also non-relevent since it only lightly touched on the main points it needed to keep the story going. Then to top it all off, it's not ships in the distance, but helicopters? A truly classic novel. The movie? You'd be better off watching a junior high play based on the novel."
4,An incredible movie from start to finish,"Lord of the Flies is a movie about the test of man and nature.Though sometimes this film reminded me alot of the Tom Hanks film castaway.Lord of the flies is a way more intersting film.It at times can be hard to watch with it's violent content and an excesive use of language.Lord of the flies is an action- packed thrill ride.The actors who portrayed ralph and piggy did an extroadanary job.This is a film that I think the Academy awards should have given a few nods like for Best Actor,Best Supporting Actor,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Sound,Best editing and so on.Lord of the Flies is an excellent book and it's a vividly imaginative film."
2,Great book -- so-so movie...,"How do you turn a book as visceral and gut-wrenching as the Lord of the Flies and turn it into Hollywood mush? If you want the answer to that question, watch this movie. Otherwise, don't bother. The acting is not exactly Haley Joel Osment quality, the scenes of savagery are played down IMO so they lose some of their horrific nature, and some of the dialogue and scenes are dumbed down.One area where this movie does get it right is the sets and the cinematography. The stunningly beautiful scenery does provide a nice offset to the action on screen. Leave it to Hollywood to get the look right -- enough to suck you in with a great trailer -- yet fail to deliver the goods."
2,"Horribly Acted, Unsatisfying Ending","Many find this movie to be chilling, but I found it to be incredibly shallow. The ending seemed so fake, and the acting is just terrible throughout. I felt like I was watching a B-rate horror movie. I highly recommend the book instead."
1,Does the director understand the concept of allegory?,"This movie was horrible, I would give it a 0 if I could, it surely doesn't deserve a 1. To begin with the boys were American, there was no separation of the boys who where and weren't in the choir, there was no surviving pilot, and most importantly all of the major metaphors where left out. Even the Lord of the Flies was entirely erased from the movie, the subject that the book is titled after has been left out! That's just totally unacceptable. The beast, which was just as important to the meaning of the book as the Lord of the Flies, was totally changed. The pilot (who shouldn't be there to begin with) was the beast and after the boys found him, that was it, the beast was gone. Imagine what Sir William Golding thought of it..."
2,strange movie,I didn't realise that this movie was a pedophile movie. The boys ran around in their underwear for most of the movie.
3,Just as I Suspected (while sitting in my chair stroking a cat),"When I was younger it seemed so much better...still good, not great...the acting is not that good...movie felt rushed...disney kids today could prolly act this s*** out of this film...the lead kid is good...hunger games before Hunger Games"
3,Good Movie,"A good movie done by the young Balthazar Getty, he went on to play TOM in Young Guns 2. Enjoyable movie, good intertainment for all over the age of 13."
1,worst movie ever!,this has to be by far the worst movie i have ever seen. very slow but when there was action...it was very depressing.
2,Not the same as the book,"It just doesn't convey the deeper meaning of William Golding's novel Lord of the Flies. The use of the pilot as the ""Beast"" was one of the worst things. The Beast was supposed to have started gradually, elavating in form and terror. The other major difference that caught my eye was the fact that Simon never has his episode with ""The Lord of the Flies"", which, by the way, literally translates to ""devil"". This part of the story is the most symbolic, and deep part of the author's message. In closing, the acting was done well, but they should have stuck more to the book's actual scenes."
4,tell me,how much blood and stuff is in this becuse i was thinking of watching it with my 10 year old
1,I want my 1 1/2hrs back,"What a terrible movie. The dialogue was terrible, the direction was terrible, the acting was terrible. Harry Hook should not have wasted my time with this remake. The motivation for the childrens' savagery was not explored nor was the identity of the 'Lord of the Flies' in this film version.Go to Peter Brook's 1963 original version. It's in B/W but so what?"
3,Americanization,"the thing which really bothered me about this adaptation of William Golding's wonderfully cynical novel, was the fact that it was Americanized. what good is the story if the boys are American? One of the key symbols in the book was that the boys came from a very refined and proper society (England) and were then turned to savages by their experiences on the island. Only an American version of this story would have the boys rescued by an entire army."
2,A Disappointment....,"When I read this novel, I wasn't thrilled with it, but it is definitely worth reading. I was excited to see the movie, but I was very disappointed afterwards. The movie barely stays true to the book, and there are ridiculous added scenes. Intense events in the book are totally omitted.... If you plan on seeing this movie, go straight to the sixties version. It is MUCH better. Although, I guess that maybe the point of the movie wasn't really to stay so true to the book, but if that isn't what you are looking for, go for the sixties version. If you do see this version, make sure you read the book first. It will make no sense to you if you haven't read the book first. No matter which version you choose, Good luck!"
