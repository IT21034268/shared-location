3,"Great music, too slow plot, SCREAM was more gory","I was very dissapointed after watching Henry. I kept hearing how gruesome it was, in fact, most of the time you didn't see the killings. I counted 15 slain bodies, but you will be more scared watching SCREAM or todays horror movies, the music was creapy, but that was about it, the plot moved tooooo slow. It was a debate between 2 or 3 stars."
2,What's the big deal?,"I bought into the hype surrounding Henry and rented it. Honestly? I really didn't get what the controversy was about. The movie was riddled with cliches (""Turn it on""), and it does not in any way, shape or form, hold true to the real story behind Lucas and Ottis Toole's deranged partnership. Add a rather hokey music sequence and it comes across as a violent movie of the week. The opening montages of the victims was effective, and the scene with the family IS disturbing and graphic enough to make you go ""Whoah."" But one whoah doesn't make it a must-have.I suggest those with a fetish for serial killers read about Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole instead of watching this. The real thing will keep you up all night- this almost put me to sleep."
1,naive and comically inept,"I've been avoiding this one for years and then I find it's Laurel and Hardy with only marginally more violence. Transcendentally jejune, it stars Micheal Rooker (his screen mum's a hooker) as the eponymous Henry who has a dilemma. ""Let me think!"" he yells, which not not being his strongest suit, forces him to a previously held conviction, ""I am a serial killer"" and at the end of the film he rests his case. I said...never mind. Before then, this laughable film had already reached it's nadir with a seduction scene to the accompaniment of a blousey sax.There's some commentary on the film's censorship history, but I couldn't be bothered. The BBFC has finally wised up to the fact that the biggest danger film's of this ilk pose to the public is to their individual IQ's. I don't mind if a film aims high and falls short but when a film aims low and can't even cut it on that level, then it's time to get out the heavy ordnance. Next stop, Oz."
2,Ask yourself why you want to see this film....,"First, ask yourself why you'd want to watch a film about a serial killer....Now that you have that answer...(be honest to yourself now!)this movie does not deliver the goods. If you want to see horrific murders, [and] perversions perpetrated upon innocent victims, etc. This is not the vehicle that gives you what you were looking for. Gore? Some. Violence? not very much. ... Nothing more than the ""R"" rated slasher film playing at your local drive in.Save your money...the type of film you were hoping for, hasn't been made since the 1970's!"
1,"A great film? Uh, no.","I can't believe this film got any kind of critical acclaim. The dialogue is ridiculous, things such as the soundtrack musical choices during parts of the film are bizarre and the acting is not exactly DeNiro-ish."
1,This Reeks!!,"Who cares if it is reality, this movie isn't scary, unsettling, or disturbing in any way. These reality horror fans alienate gore films, but did you know, that gore is a real thing! I don't belong to any genre of horror, but to be honest, this [is bad]. It is a waste of time. It's boring! There is nothing scary about this reality genre. It's an excuse used by the directors, because in reality they couldn't deliver any shocks, or scares. That is the reality of reality horror films. They [are bad], and that's all there is to it. Don't buy it. Thank you for saving yourself from a mindless boring movie like this one. ..."
1,DONT BUY THIS,This movie sucks. I read it was sooo scary but you dont even see him kill anyone! The movie is so short that you cant believe it just randomly ends? not worth the money. Its stupid.
5,Kuntry Edukasion,"Searching out disturbing and perverted movies to watch is a hobby I share with my (apprehensive) friends. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is the most disturbing video i've seen, and several years after watching the movie i still can not forget the murder of the suburban family that has been described in other reviews here. It is possibly the most horrifying filmed scene ever witnessed."
4,Double-Dose of Disturbing,"This movie is a double dose of disturbing! Not only is it based on the exploits of real life serial killer Henry Lee Lucas and his equally whacked-out sidekick Otis Toole, but director John McNaughton chose to film the movie in a bleak, realistic, documentary style adding an uncanny sense of voyeurism to the bombardment of vicious murders, rapes and all out debauchery. Michael Rooker gives a powerful performance as Henry and truly captures the menace and insanity of one of America's most lethal serial killers."
2,Its ok.,"The pin itself appears to be in pretty good condition for a cheap price. However, the pin is Made in China. I thought it was Made in USA because the company is in Colorado, but I was wrong and I am not happy about it."
3,"Sadly, just a documentary","I didn't read the fine print, so I didn't realize that this was a documentary. However, it is beautifully done. The interviews are wonderful, although in French. The English subtitles are just fine. It was exciting to see the original dancers that Nureyev had ""made"" this version on and to see them both dancing and training the next generation.The camera work and editting on this film are seamless as we are moved from the rehearsal studio to the stage rehearsals, then on to the performances.All in all, this is a video worth having and watching over and over as it captures a rare moment in time and at the end of Nureyev's life.A similar documentary was done on Raymonda. It, too, is worth having. It would be nice to have the full length ballets."
1,another bad dvd-r,picture jerks and shakes. very hard to watch this train wreck of a dvd. Not only did i pay good top dollar for this but now i have to pay to have it carried off in my trash!! If you want a head ache then this is your movie.
1,At least the title is good...,"As a person who enjoys a good scientific history (nerd alert), I was very disappointed in Galileo and the Dolphins. The writing is poor and the topics treated in a superficial and sensationalistic fashion. For very good books in this genre I would suggest Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything or The Know-It-All... by A. J. Jacobs."
3,The top comes off (violently),This is a good case but the top comes crashing off when you open it past 90 degrees. Also have some trouble closing it; have to adjust the records to have it seat properly.
2,Not What I Expected,"I suppose this is a good book if you have NEVER rubber stamped or seen anything other that stamp on ink on paper. But I am rather inexperienced, and I thought this was not good at all for what I was looking for. If you are new to rubber stamping, fine. But if you have anything more than even the most basic experience, I'd pass on this and get something more advanced."
3,so-so,"I watched this movie expecting too much. Unfortunately, though well-acted, it is a little too slow to be described as good."
3,Don't purchase for the design,"Content useful for rudimentary typography instruction however the typesetting for abook on typography leaves much to be desired with poor line breaks and bad rags.As such a good tool to demonstrate poor rags to students. Rather old-fashioned and stodgyas book design goes. Material could be more accessible and interesting to students of designif the layout was more sensitive to ""high"" design or at minimum in keeping with books likeBringhurst's "" The Elements of Typographic Style."" Ellen Lupton does a better job with her books.This book is way too expensive for young designers!"
4,Exciting Bartok,"It is a shame there is not more video of this conductor. He should be viewed by every conducting student out there. His baton technique is so plain and, almost, textbook-like that one could almost say amaturish. But, the results are excellent. Both the Mendelssohn and Strauss are pretty stright-forward (Solti's video of the Mendelssohn with Chicago is better). The Bartok, on the other-hand, gets a spirited peformance. This suite was composed, some might say it was also a reaction to, Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"". So, it is not a piece one can sit back and mellow-out to. This work, and the performance, is highly charged and one helleva wild ride. It's a shame he didn't do the entire ballet (which is only 15 minutes longer), but, that would have required the addition of a chorus.This would make a good addition to any collection.Frankly, I am eager to see what other videos DGG has out there to release."
2,Don't let the positive reviews fool you.,"Season 2 was very disappointing. Poor writing and plot development. Mya one of the new characters is made to be this naive, stupid woman, who will turn on her own brother to be with Sylar who she just met. Ridiculous. The funny HIRO in the first season, is nothing more than a love sick school boy in season 2. New characters come in, only to be killed right away. No character development, no creativity in the plot, if you are a fan buy it when the price goes down."
2,Couldn't barely get into it.,"I bought season two because i was so addicted to season one. I rush home to put it in, and BAM instant disappointment. First off it had two less discs than season one. (not that big of a deal, i figured it would still be amazing) But then I put it in and I just couldn't get into it. I still haven't finished watching it and I started it a couple weeks ago. It just doesn't have the same suspense and it doesn't keep you interested. Plus, for me, it was quite predictable. I'm going to to try and watch it again and see if it was just an off day for me, but as of now, it was a disappointment, and a waste of 30 something dollars."
1,Season 2 was a huge disappointment,"The whole Hiro in the past was tedious and the resolution of the Shanti virus was completely underwhelming. Plus, that kid with the power to take apart electronic stuff is annoying and useless. This was probably due to the lack of funding, but this show always failed to deliver a truly climactic superhero battle. After the Watchmen-like awesomeness of Season 1, the second season really killed it for me. Slap anyone who compares Season 2 Heroes with anything from Lost."
4,"Not Season One, but still compelling","Another year, another big mystery and the world to save. Lots of new heroes, lots of changes for the original set. Hiro goes back in time, Matt and Mohinder are caring for Molly, Micah goes to post-Katrina New Orleans. Both Hiro's dad and Micah's grandma are former Star Trek stars, leading me to wonder if there's a connection there....It's not as fascinating as season one, and the price is a little high for a half-season shortened by the strike, but if you're a Heroes fan, you should definitely pick it up."
2,A nightmare to be forgotten,"If you loved Season 1 and were addicted to how brilliant it was, you may be compelled to think about Season 2 and Season 3 DVD sets as an essential purchase. But don't be fooled. Be informed that that the sophomore seasons of Heroes have a noticeable drop in:- writing quality- directing- acting from certain members of the cast (ahem-Hayden Panettiere-ahem).Overall, it was a bad year for Heroes. The DVD-treatment itself is excellent: audio and video quality rarely gets better than this. The problem is that with episodes this bad, boring and ridden with plot-holes, you won't want ever to rewatch them or even access the special features.In retrospect, I think watching Season 2 and 3 is not necessary to understand what will happen next. I am not sure whether this fact is a compliment or a criticism of Heroes. Save yourself the $$$ and just wait out this year and watch Season 4. Forget Season 2 and 3 like you forget a bad nightmare."
3,A stepping stone not a milestone,"I basically bought this because I'm a fan of Heroes. I didn't really like the second season. I've watched this season once since I bought it, but never after that. I watched the third season premiere last night and it seemed like everybody was getting back in form as far as writing goes. So let's hope the third season is a milestone not a stepping stone."
2,Did not live up to the first season,"I can't express how disappointed I am with this season of Heroes. I bought the first season on DVD and stayed up all night so I could finish it in a few days. I just couldn't pull myself away from it. Then this season came, and it isn't even close. This was a short season because this was also when the writers strike happened. One of the biggest problems was the main writer from the first season left the show, and with him went the story. It just couldn't keep me. There are several places where the show just left you hanging. There are characters introduced and then they just go away. There is no real resolution with them."
5,my favorite show,i wish that nbc has never taken this show off of the air. it is one of them shows that you have to see from season 1 and on to under stand the show. the best.
3,Writer's Strike,"It's truely unfortunate how quickly this show took a nose-dive after such an excellent first season. This is easily the worst season of Heroes, but to fair this is due to the writer's strike and their best writer from the first season leaving; he returns for the forth season but it's too late to save the show. Having said all that there's still some great progression with the main characters and a fair amount of interesting new characters that works well within season 2. If you're only a casual fan of the show I'd recommend skipping this one, as it doesn't really tie much into the rest of the series aside from a few details, and only purchase the first season, but if you're a pretty big fan then get all of them since there's only four seasons."
1,"Great show, but couldn't watch it all!","For those of you wanting to know if you should watch the show, the answer is YES!!! But buy it from a local store or somewhere where you can easily return or exchange it if it doesn't work. Our copy freezes/skips at all the most inopportune times. The disks looked fine, there were no visible imperfections, but they wouldn't play in either blu-ray or the DVD player."
3,Price dropped to $25.00 so I picked it up.,Not a bad buy for the price but still nowhere near as good as the first season.
3,Nowhere near as good as Season 1,"This is a good series and season 2 holds up, barely. The writers strike hurt it badly but it does continue the story that I did not want to die."
4,Heros -C-zon- dos,"An interesting portrayal of heros based in todays modern society and how the world would deal with such people. Reminds me a little of a comic book series Rising Stars , but not really because RS is much more acurate. A good watch, I wouldent stand watching it on TV and waiting to C what happened next though. The goal of most is to make a good program, they manage to get close to telling the truth about the world but not crossing the NBS I mean NBC lines."
2,wow this one really sucks,I love the first volume but this one no good at all... I dont know what happen to the writer in this volume.
5,Great Buy!,Wonderful shows to watch. Great viewing quality and have enjoying watching it over and over again. Great buy. Worth the money.
4,Okay season,"For those who have watched season 1, the whole of this season is really nothing like the first season. That being said, I would say the pace begins to pick up with the last four or five episodes of season 2. Those last episodes are pretty close to quality in season 1. They are the redeeming factor in an otherwise slow season."
3,"Not the best, but worth watching","It wasn't the best of heroes, maybe because of the writers strike, but worth watching, but only once."
4,Interesting season,"I thought it was an okay season. I'm a little disappointed that they went for the trite no-good-villain-ever-dies storyline. I'm also bummed that they killed off D.L.; I would have thought that there were legs on that storyline (even without having Nicky's multiple personalities). I'm grateful that they weren't able to use the whole decimated-town scenario, that would have made things too weird."
4,"The ""diet"" version of a Hero's season","I bought season 2 Hero's online here at Amazon and like anything to do with Hero's, it was great. But of all 3 seasons (at this time we are not 1/2 way through season 3 on TV) this is the weakest for reasons that could not have beeb determined. This season was full tilt when the writters strike began and hence problems arose with what to do.Of interesting note is the extra's on Blue-Ray where you can listen to the writers and directors talk about the challanges and what they WERE going to do instead of the unclamatic ending that we got.If you like Hero's this is a must buy!"
2,Wow.... this was stupid.,"Just thought I'd add my rating. This season had no structure. It seemed like scenes were filmed, thrown in a hat, and tossed about on the DVD."
4,The DVD extras are great,"Well its obvious that the story quality of season 2 did not match season 1. But i'm not here to bash the season, i'm here to tell fans that the bonus material on here very much helps make up for the disappointments in story. All 11 episodes have their own commentary and there is about an hour and a half of bonus behind the scenes etc footage to watch through out the 4 DVDs. As for the season itself, the first half was pretty weak but the 2nd half got the ball rolling and became much more interesting. And if you're giving the season a bad review because it was only half as long as season 1... well thats not even fair because it was the writer's strike that caused this, not Tim Kring. All TV shows in the 2007-2008 season suffered from that strike. I look forward to season 3."
4,T short,"Ill admit season 2 did not live up to the first, but it was still well written and put together. The only major disappointment was the length of the season. I think the reason why most of the reviews here are bashing season 2 is because it did not has enough episodes to build up into anything big. Hopefully season 3 will get the show back on track."
3,Disappointing Season but not a terrible one,"First let me say this. I found Season Two of Heroes to be a letdown. The storylines were too slow, there were too many new - and uninteresting - characters introduced and the climax of the season felt rushed. I don't completely blame this on the writers, though, because the strike may have prevented the full ark of Season Two from being fleshed out. Nevertheless, the season didn't live up to its potential.Despite my disappointment with ""Generations"", there were quite a few things to like about this season (such as The Nightmare Man, Elle, Adam, etc.) and everything from ""Four Months Ago"" and after was entertaining. And for what it's worth, Season Two of Heroes was still better than a lot of the crap that came on this season (Bionic Woman, anyone).While certainly a big misstep, Season Two of Heroes wasn't the disaster people made it out to be and was quite enjoyable at times. Hopefully, though, ""Villains"" will get Heroes back on track."
4,"Finally, Heroes starts being interesting again",I am happy heroes seems to have turned it around in terms of story line. Ordering these on unbox is great. No commercials.
3,Half and Half,"Ok the first 6 episodes were not very good, but episodes 7-11 are very good. In essence, don't spend $26 on four good episodes. While the season is cheaper than the last one, you get less episodes and they're not as good. Download the good one or wait because even the most hardcore Heroes fans probably won't be picking this one up right away."
2,Failed to follow an excellent 1st season,"Season two can be summarized neatly into one word: disappointing. Beyond that King showed us that instead of taking the characters we love and developing them further, he would rather split the plot to introduce new heroes who are ultimately killed off. Yes, our main villain with the eyebrows is back, (Sylar) but most of the season he spends it in amnesiac wanderings. Then there is the story of Hiro, who travels back in time only (oh so predictably) to be the cause of his own altered timeline (these paradoxes get repeated in almost every single time travel show in the history of tv/film, including the animated comedy Futurama where Fry travels back in time to sleep with his own grandmother, ugh). Anyway, if you want a good show watch season One. Season two will notoriously disappoint. Not sure how season Three will recover this failed attempt, but I am hopeful it does. There is not that much to watch on tv these days."
1,Tim Kring what are you thinking?,Your show has fallen to pieces. I hope the real writers are back not the 2 cent replacements for season 2. Heroes was horrible and hope they can make the characters just a little believable as in season 1. I am sad to even respond to series as season 2. Do not get this unless you can get a copy fot $ 5.00. This show had so much potential. I am going to try a few season three episodes if they don't get better I will sell my season one immediately.... ouch!!!
5,wow!!!,i placed my order got it two days later as i got to the last disk it was messed up i emailed amazon they sent me a new one isent them the old one i love it perfect condition the best show on tv at this leavle of wrighting and dyalog. wonderful panting just check it out and thankyou amazon!!
5,Now we know who shot Nathan,"Great DVD set. Can't wait for Season 3 to come out on DVD, even though the season just started. Alot of my friends are now getting hooked on the global phenomenon of Heroes. The special features in this set are great. It opens up a much bigger world of the Heroes series. I recommend this to anyone."
1,Great Show... Great Episode... WHY NOT ON ITUNES?!?!,"This show is amazing... as are MANY NBC shows. However, I'm disappointed that these shows are not available via iTunes. I'd REALLY like to be able to put this on my iPod and view with my Mac."
1,Terrible Interface / No Mac Support,"(1) I keep clicking in the interface and nothing happens. That stinks and reminds me why I don't use Windows in the first place.(2) No pause button to pause the download.(3) Cannot play the video while it's downloading(4) Forced me to upgrade to Windows Media player 10; didn't want that(5) Forced me to load .Net (not an open internet standard) which I didn't want on this volume. My fault. I should have created an OS snapshot before doing this.(6) No way to convert to a ****standard**** like MPEG4 so I could mount video to my iTunes Library.RECOMMENDATION: Amazon should partner with Apple and tell NBC, FOX and other networks how to properly do online video, like iTunes."
1,Too bad it's PC only,"No Mac support? Too bad, I would have bought both seasons. Rather short sighted to leave out the fastest growing market segment. I mean really, who uses a PC anymore anyway?"
1,Unhappy,I never received this order. I have tried to contact the supplier to no avail. Amazon.com is working on my refund.
1,There's always bittorrent,"Overall, a bad customer experience but a minor blocker in accessing the content.It's interesting though that while NBC left iTunes in a snit because Apple wouldn't bow to their price gouging (NBC wanted to charge $4.99 per episode vs. Apple's $1.99), and now Amazon distributes this content for exactly that price!?I'm guessing that the UNBOX (terrible name) currently has a fraction of the users drawn by iTunes, and this play is another Apple doomsday forecast... But does anyone have educated insight?"
3,"Needed more joy, humor, and a compelling story arc","There are still plenty of things to like in Season 2: the return to TV of Kristen Bell, Star Trek alumni Nichelle Nichols and George Takei in guest roles, the adorable Micah, likeable Ando, and the relationship among Matt, Molly, and the Doc, as well as the Petrelli brothers and their conniving mother.The problems: the storylines about the virus are a pale echo of the final season of the 4400; Hiro's trip to the past should not have been so dull; there's a lot of tragedy, violence, and angst without the humor and to joy to balance them out. And what Hiro did to Adam Monroe is inexcusable."
3,OK - for a computer video,"If you don't have time to watch it on TV, don't like the commercials, and are a computer-junkie (Windows, that is), this might be a good fit. But what bothers me about this is that there really is no way to view it on TV, unless you've got some hook-up from your computer to the TV. So you're stuck watching it on your small-screen computer monitor. Why can't they sell the files so that you can burn a DVD and watch it on your TV? Considering the amount that they're saving on packaging, etc., it seems like this would be something worth considering. The quality really isn't bad for a computer; but for those who would like a little more, like the ability to watch on TV, you'll be largely disappointed, as it can't be converted."
3,Buyer Beware,"I can't really review the content, because I held off watching Season 2 for the Blu Ray realease. After returning two copies, I learned that the set won't play on BRD players which do not have the current 3.95 Firmware upgrade.I love the way that Blu Ray looks, but between the price differential and keeping up with firmware upgrades I sort of regrett the investment.Firmware upgrades are available on line at WWW.sonystyle.com or by calling Sony for a disc with installation instructions. Would have been nice if this would have been noted somewhere on the packaging!!!!!"
1,Self limited market share,I bought all of season 1 for my iPod. I'm only buying this 1 episode because the network at my hotel is too slow to watch it comfortably on the NBC site.
4,Awsum show,"This show keeps you guessing, and on the edge of your seat. The way it has been is; anything can happen and will."
4,So many twists and turns,"I am rewatching the series. I loved the first two seasons the first time through, and I loved it more the second time. I think the writer strike might have ruined this show midway through, but it is still worth watching."
2,Don't Bother,"Because of the writer's strike, this season is completely convoluted. Nothing makes sense the plot doesn't flow, seriously wish I hadn't bought this."
3,Worth the watch only because SSN 3 will be great.,"I loved season one of Heroes. LOVED IT. Unfortunately, season 2 really let me down. The writing wasn't nearly as good, the stories stumbled, and the acting even sagged with the general production decline.HOWEVER! There is a ton of information stashed in this season that everyone will need if they want to keep watching this fall. I wasn't sure if I would tune in, but then I went to Comic Con, where they let us watch the entire first episode of season 3. It was amazing! That episode makes up for everything wrong with season 2. When this comes out tomorrow morning, I'm going to go pick it up and re-watch it, just so I'm ready for what is to come.I make no excuses for season 2. I only beg you to give the show another shot this year, because I sincerely think it'll change all those skeptics into believers."
1,What a disappointment :* (,"This is probably the most disappointing show I've ever watched. Imagine the level of wonderfulness you got from season one, this is the exact opposite. It was short, outrageously short, I didn't even realize at first that I had just watched the last episode because it ended leaving everything so unfinished. This doesn't mean it had a really good hook as an ending. It just plain fizzled like people got up and walked away in the middle of production. I can't really think of a positive thing to say about this season. I was so disappointed. It's been three weeks since I watched the full thing and I'm still fuming."
5,My husband loves this!,My husband is a heroes freak! However this will be our last season to buy because the show has gotten way to weird for us. RIP.
5,Fantastic,I could not stop watch this movie.I think I finished the whole DVD like a day or 2.So good.Loved it.
4,Comic Fun,"As a kid I collected comic books. I had some great first editions. Little did I know that they would become valuable later on. Heroes merges comic art and scripts with live action. The pace is fast the plots and twists are great, the characters are fascinating. Never knowing who's a good guy and who's a bad guy keeps you guessing. And the alternate ending was a great touch."
2,Roll on Season 3...,"Season 1 was brilliant: fresh, inspired, not afraid to take risks. Season 2? Rather insipid, I'm afraid. Peter's love interest, the whole Shanti virus... it's really not very good. It should be called Season 1.5, bring on the REAL Season 2!"
3,Must Watch To Get From Season 1 To Season 3,"Heroes Season 2 is not as good as Season 1 due to the writer's strike. It would have likely been the end of the show if they didn't move a head with Season 2, but the show did suffer some. There are a lot reviews for Heroes Season 2 that point out the many flaws and give spoilers, so I don't need to do that here. My only observation is that the some of characters acted completely... well out of character, and a lot of plot devices were used to move the weaker plot lines along. If Season 1 wasn't as good as it was, this Season would not have been so disapointing.Still all of that said, you need to watch Season 2 to get to Season 3, so recommended for the Heroes fan."
1,One-hit wonder tanks in season 2,"The best thing to happen to season 2 was the writer's strike, it put the season out of its misery! With that the producers decided to cancel the rest of the season and try again next year.The cliffhanger from season 1 was not even delt with until most viewers stopped watching.Oh, this second season was PAINFUL to watch! My co-workers dropped out after only 4 episodes. I recorded the show so that I could fast forward through, hoping it would get back on track. It never did, I kept fast forwarding through the entire season.Season 1 was great, never to be equaled by season 2. Maybe season 3 will be better, if anyone is still watching. It is sad to see the hottest show of 2006 go down in flames in 2007."
2,Fantastic failure compared to Season 1,"I was a huge fan of the series in Season 1. I followed it religiously. I posted on the forums. I read every post of speculation.Then came Season 2, the WGA strikes, and general drop in storyline quality. I started skipping as much of the auxiliary story line as possible. I started to skip episodes.And at the end of the hastily put together season 2? I didn't care to look for Season 3.Honestly, Season 3 is called Villains, and should feature the WGA strikers. They've done a great job of ruining the season 2 storylines."
1,Just an absolute train wreck,"At least X-Files had the good graces to die a horrible death after giving us 5-6 solid, can't miss seasons before going completely off the rails. Heroes barely managed to keep it together for one, and that points to a lack of creative vision, execution and direction. Shame on them for taking the best new show on TV in years and making a mockery of everyone who looked forward to next week.If you felt incredibly let down by the horrible anti-climactic 'confrontation' at the end of Season 1, do not expect Season 2 to make up for it. In fact, quite the opposite, leading one to see the end of Season 1 as nothing more than a portent of (crappy) things to come."
4,Great Season!!!,i didnt c season 1 until after i saw this season 2 and heroes is an awesome show and i cant wait until the 3rd season
3,Not as good as Season 1 (or 3),"Sadly, the writer's strike cut this season off short. Or perhaps mercifully?That didn't stop it from including a horrible storyline about a girl from New Orleans who learns wrestling moves from an ipod and daydreams about hurricane Katrina. The character was so unbearably horrible that they, and anyone else around them, have been cut from the third season.Other than that, the main villian of the show is absent for most of the episodes while a big portion of it occurs in ancient japan.Honestly, if you are not already a die hard fan of the show I wouldn't pick this up unless you want to laugh at it."
3,Second Chance,"I absolutely LOVE the first season and stopped watching the show after season two last time. So I started all over and I'm going to watch all 4 SEASONS, because it's my understanding that the writers were on strike during season two. So maybe it got better again."
5,Hereos Season 2,After watching Season 1 I just couldn't wait for Season 2. It's non stop action and the plots are convoluted enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. The characters are really well defined & I can't wait until I buy Season 3.
5,great shows - great price,"I really love the show on television but had missed a few of the episodes, so I ordered them through Amazon. I got the season right away. Shipping was cheap and the timing was great. If you are a person who likes this type of show I would highly recommend getting the series. I plan on getting all of them as they come out."
4,Really enjoyed it,I caught up on all my Heroes viewing in two nights. How awesome is that. I can't wait for the Season 3 DVD.
2,Didn't feel it,After researching a more natural way to get energy I came across blue green algae... Didn't do all that much for me as far as energy but I do think that it may help those with weak immune systems.
3,Disapointed with Source Naturals,"They usually have got terrific products (in term of being easy to swallow and the sort) but there blue green algae just falls short. B/c it's not capsuled it has a gross feel to it making it hard to swallow and as different reviewer said it just smells horribly (they couldn't just spend the extra money and put it in a capsule?).On a side note, did they have to go with the misleading labeling? It's just real sleazy of them. There are lots of other brands out there..."
2,"good benefits, but terrible odor","When my daughter turned eighteen her doctor recommended her to get on a blue-green algae supplement to develop a healthy foundation. Source Naturals seemed to be on the top of the list here, so I bought a bottle. The benefits as described are great, but when my daughter opened the bottle and placed one in her mouth, she gagged. I smelled the bottle and it smelled fishy and putrid. I thought it was a bad batch, but after returning and receiving another one, it had the same odor. I was also disappointed at the fact that the label read 500MG but was referring to two tablets - so they're only 250mg each.If you can get past the unappetizing smell and pop it in your mouth, this product is fine. My daughter can't, so I bought herthis Blue-green Algaefor around the same price. It provides the same benefits without the terrible odor and my daughter has been taking it for four weeks now, no problem."
2,:( not too happy,"I believe this CD had good intentions but did not manage to pull them off. The song are classafiable as authentic, however the music is very synthetic. There is very heavy use of keyboards and electronic instruments that just takes away from the songs as a whole. This CD is dancable but I found the music to sound too fake. And for those looking for DRUM SOLOS you are out of luck."
4,"Good, but not quite there for me.","I like this cd a lot. It's good, but what I'm not really into are the male chanting songs; I prefer the musical instrument ones, but it's good overall. I took one star for the bollywood stuff."
2,Started out promisingly but fell flat,I found it hard to get into the story because the characters were poorly developed and some aspects of the story felt thrown in with little thought.
5,Tamar,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book not just for the story but for the excellent background puting everything in its time and place in New Zealand. I am now starting on the second book in the series.
3,Death In Deep Water,"Aristotle 'Soc' Socarides, part-time fisherman, part-time private detective, is hired by the owners of Oceanus marine park to investigate the death of their much disliked whale trainor. The park's owners hope to exonerate suspected killer whale, Rocky, so the sale of the park to Japanese businessmen can proceed smoothly.Within hours of accepting the case, Soc finds himself dealing with a fanatic animal rights group, being suspected of the murder of a former Oceanus employee, and employed undercover at Oceanus.An overall enjoyable book with the exception of the author's attempt to inject humor via the use of numerous inane comparisons. The comparisons weren't funny and detracted from the otherwise solid read."
4,Awsum background,"This is the first Andian music I have listened to - some of the more authentic Smithsonian editions are not as melodic and easy - I love this one - up beat, makes you want to move but doean't interfere with conversation, etc. Definitely gives you a feel for the Cloud Forest - I have ordered 3 more by this group."
2,The book was hard to follow,I have read some of Deepak's work that was good and easy to follow. This one was not in that category. I will seek recommendations from friends next time.
3,Good,"Since I purchased other books & DVD from Dr. Chopra.This book is pretty much the same like other ones in term of concepts.I was looking for more practice examples parents face daily when teaching their children.This book is lack of that, very few examples. Mostly talks at a higher level (spiritually)...which is good if you don't own other books from him."
5,ESSENTIAL BOOK FOR PARENTS,"I WISH I HAD OWNED THIS BOOK WHEN I HAD SMALL CHILDREN, IT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN ME THROUGH SOME TOUGH DAYS- AND MY CHILDREN WOULD HAVE LESS EMOTIONAL 'ADULT BAGGAGE'"
1,Wrong Wrong Wrong,"The description includes this quote:""Product Dimensions: 1.3 x 5 x 6.5 inches.""I could put my thumb in the opening, but the measurements are completely misleading.It's a small shell."
1,la tregua,"I am still waiting to receive this movie, it is over a month now and I have no response from sender"
3,Bad format,"Format makes it difficult to find what you're looking for. Arranged according to region, you can get lost and forget what you were looking for. Simply the Best, another cookbook by Weight Watchers (now available in paperback!) is a much better buy, with everything arranged in an easy format, such as appetizers, soups, chicken, pasta etc... This book also leans very much toward seafood, so if you aren't a seafood lover, you might not find too many realistic dishes you like."
2,Takes More Time to Find the Recipes Than to Cook Them!!,"I have a collection of seven books from Weight Watchers and this was a disappointment. The table of contents breaks the recipes down by US region. However, there are NO PAGE NUMBERS anywhere in that listing. There are also no tabs or distinctions between sections so the user has to flip through the pages to find where one section ends and another begins. When you do find the beginning of a section, the recipe titles are listed but again, no page numbers are supplied! These faults aside, the recipes are first rate. I loved the Vermont Cheddar Soup as it reminded me of growing up in the Green Mountain State.If you don't mind taking the time to peruse the book thoroughly, you will like what you find. However, I would recommend an earlier book, Simply the Best. It is well illustrated, simple to use and the recipe collection is outstanding."
1,A table of contents without page numbers????,The most frustrating thing about this book is that the table of contents has no page numbers. This makes this book particularly difficult to use since it is categorized by region and only categorized by type of food when you get to the regional chapters which -- if you didn't already understand my frustration -- were not numbered in the table of contents. I am really glad that this was a hand-me-down because I would have hated to have paid money for it.
3,Just ok,This cookbook is not my favorite weight watchers cookbook - I don't really use it much. Weight Watcher Simply Delicious is much better in my opinion!
2,Nice idea but it doesn't work well,We intended to use the water bottle to monitor how much water we drink each day. The little computer didn't work well and was difficult to use. It's sitting on the self. I don't recommend it.
4,Goku Vs. Pikkon:The Battle In Otherworld,"This vhs contains 3 episodes:Episode 183:Final Round: As Goku defeats the giant dinasaur, he meets his last oppenet:Pikkon! Can Goku claim the tournement prize in the final round?Is Pikkon, actully stronger then the great Goku?Episode 184:Goku Vs. Pikkon: As the two finalists, reveal their secrets!The ring shakes as Goku goes Super Sayin, and Pikkon takes off his heavy clothing. Can Goku surive Pikkon`s advanced attacks? Or will SS Goku be crushed by Pikkon`s Thunder Flash Attack?Episode 185:Gohan Goes To Highschool:While the Otherworld Tournement took place, in well...Otherworld, on Earth, 7 years have passed since Gohan defeated Cell!And Gohan is a teenager! Turning Super Sayin to conceal his idenity, Gohan defeats a band of bank robbers, but now must surive highschool, and must be careful not to reveal that he is the mysterious Gold Fighter!"
4,A Major Improvement Over The First Tape,I only consider this tape better then the first one because of the battle between Goku and Pikkon. It wasn't that special though. Goku turned into a Super Saiyan. OH wow that's new! However the battle was exciting I guess. All I can say is I hope the next to Great Saiya Man tapes are better then these two. I gave this tape 4 stars because the last episode was boring. I wouldn't get this unless you really want to see some new episodes.

3,"Jack Murray, Sheriff","While I really liked Jack Murray, I found Beth Sommers to be unbelieveable. For a woman who has been physically and emotionally abused by her ex-husband she appeared to recover in record time without the benefit of having been in any type of therapy. I would like to have the author, Janice Kay Johnson, research her characters more completely next time. I am a social worker and I can tell you that the women I have worked with that have been through what Beth was through did not come out of it healed without some type of intervention. Too unbelievable for me."
4,Awesome!!!,"This is Trevor Rabin's best work.I especially liked track 9 ""Launch.""It kept me going throughout the 8 minute playing time.I am dissapointed that a couple of tracks were missing.The music from the ""Independance"" crashing was left out.Also,the opening music was left out as well.Overall this is a must have CD if you liked the movie."
3,Too much left out....,"Armageddon isn't a bad score but I really think Trevor Rabin left way too much out of this one. I've seen the movie many times and there is so much more great sounding music he could have used on this. His ""Burn Around the Moon/Independence Crash,"" ""Detonation,"" and ""Astronauts"" themes were amazing, thrilling, and moving. It would be neat to see him come out with another track that had all his works from this particular movie on it. But he's done better. Check out his work from ""Deep Blue Sea"" and ""Remember the Titans."" Masterpieces!!"
4,Trevor Rabin Triumphs with a very good score,"I was very surprised on how well this music for Armageddon most of the music is worth the price of the cd. But the tracks 4,12,13 are very irritating and do not fit in with the rest of the score the best tracks are 9) launch which kept me listening till the very end and The Armageddon Piano is a tender piece of music but horribly short only 33 seconds it should have been at least a minute or longer and Harry Gregson-Williams music is missing i wonder why. I hope that there will be a Volume 2 cd because there was music left out of this cd."
2,Total Disappointment,"Can I just say how completely disappointed I was when I bought this CD. The score for the movie has several outstanding cues, most of which were not included on the CD. For example, the AJ/Grace piano theme -- the reason I wanted the score -- is nowhere to be found. There is this tiny piano track on the CD that lasts about 10 seconds, but it's so pointless one wonders why it was even included. Most of the romantic elements of the score are absent -- a BIG mistake. Instead, we get a ""suite"" by Rabin (Track One) that really doesn't distinguish itself in any way for me. I just can't understand how you can put together a score CD and leave out half the music!"
1,"5 stars for the score in the movie, 1 for the CD",Missing all the good music by Harry Gregson-Williams
3,GOOD. Missing the key elements.,"When I ordered the score to this movie I had alot of expectations. But as I listened on, I felt robbed. It was missing the key music from the movie that is not on the CD. 1. The opening ""End of the world"" sequence, 2. The destruction of N.Y. and Paris. 3. The orbit around the moon and the crash landing of the Independence. 4. The death of Harry and the explosion of the Asteriod. 5. The closing credits after Aerosmith. These important elements contributed to the film and gave me a sense of patriotism. My question is what is the reason for editing the music in the film? Is there a soundtrack extension in the making? If, so when ."
4,Where is the entire opening sequence???,"I like Trevor Rabin's score for this film. He did an excellent job mixing orchestral music with contemporary rock music. I was, however, dissapointed that some of the key music cues weren't available. The entire score for the opening ""End of the World"" sequence was missing. And cues for scenes like the destruction of New York and Paris gone. These were some of my favorite cues. This CD seemed to only contain the more upbeat tracks... Over all the soundtrack for this movie was good, it just could use more cues..."
4,Buy it,"""Launch"" is outstanding. I don't know if a better action genre music track has ever beeen made."
3,Armageddon-Trevor Rabin score,"Rather disappointed that some of the good stuff is missing.eg The opening ""death of the dinosaurs"" music. Some of the poignant cues are gone,but the stuff that's left is still better than the stodgy MTV style ""hits"" s/t album, which features only a tiny bit of the score music. This pressing of the score is very good ""HD CD"" quality and there are plenty of sonic fireworks. Perhaps there were some contractual problems with the other composer who worked on this film. No music by Harry Gregson-Williams has been included. You may like to search for the 2 CD bootleg which has all of the music recorded for the film by the two composers, including all of the cues and alternate takes. Seek and ye shall find."
5,The best score CD in a long time,"Yes, I enjoyed Trevor Rabin's score much more than I enjoyed Titanic score. This CD and movie make Titanic look like slow ride to grandma's house. One million thumbs up for me."
5,Wow the different cultures,I used this book for my Culture Anthropology report and this subject was certainly intense. I felt this book was very comprehensive and graphic in its discription of male cultural concepts.
5,There best live Cd!,"This is the best live release they've put out. I have ""thank you goodnight"", and it's not half as good. The sound quality is much better on this release and they were at the top of their game,this is the definitive line-up also. Great White are an incredible live band, better than their studio releases, so if you can find it buy it!"
3,great white could have done better,this album has a good collection of songs but i know that great white is capable of playing them a lot better. but if you are a diehard fan i would recommend getting it because the wide varitey of songs gives this album credit.
4,Book Arrived promptly in good condition,"There was a noticeable dent on the book, but not a big deal. Book came promptly and was in clean and good condition. Great buy!"
2,This is my textbook for EM,"I think this book in not a very good intro to EM for an undergraduate student. The presentation of theory is fine, butthis book lacks clear examples of how to set up problems. I learn best with this approach: ""Tell me how, and I forget. Show me, and I remember."" This text ""tells"" plenty, however it lacks on the ""showing how""."
2,disapointing,"No input select on front of tv, you have to use the power buttong to switch the source.from day one screen has dark spots on it , 40 days after purchase the tv dies."
4,"Tribute to ""Tribute to Earth, Wind & Fire""","When I checked out the line-up for this project I started to drool. Sounded like a dream come true. E,W&F; have always had a strong jazz element running through their music, but I'm wary of any ""Smooth Jazz"" treatments. The choice of songs is incisive; they're not all the obvious tunes. The playing here is all first rate. I forget how nice an acoustic pianist Patrice Rushen can be. Lots of tasty guitar work. I'm a jazz freak, and an E,W&F; freak, so my expectations are SKY HIGH. This CD cooks. I'm wearing it out. That said, when I saw that Wallace Roney and Roy Hargrove were involved I envisioned some unison or harmony horn lines, either some of the famous E,W&F; lines or some related instrumental riffs. Roney and Roy take some pleasing solos, but they're not integral to the arrangements.If they'd have worked the horns in as a unit on a couple of the tracks this would be a through the roof Five Star rating."
3,COLLECTABLE BUT EXPENSIVE,this figure looks like roger moore but only collectable if you like james bond for older collecters only
4,Pleased,"Having been a long-time fan of Mr. Eric Braeden, I am thoroughly satisfied with '100 Rifles' in which he acted with Mr. Fernando Lamas. This is one of Mr. Braeden's last performances under his original name of Hans Gudegast, and as always, his performance was 'sterling' - - to say the least."
4,Worth adding to your collection,Stars you wouldn't necessarily put together. Big stars in the era 1960's - 70's. Entertaining and spectacular. Overall a good movie for your collection.
4,oppressed Yaqui Indians vs. the Mexican government,"From the vintage mid '60s-early '70s era of offbeat 'n' out-of-control Euro-inspired Mexico-set westerns; shot spaghetti-style on location in Almeria, Spain with a script co-written by Clair Huffaker. Perhaps Jim Brown's best film performance (now where are DVDs of 1969's ""Riot"", 1970's ""...tick...tick...tick..."" & ""El Condor"", and 1974's ""Three the Hard Way""?) ....... with Burt Reynolds, Raquel Welch, Fernando Lamas, plus a bit part appearance by Soledad Miranda.anamorphic 1.85:1 transfer but not a special edition DVD - no original trailer, just some photos, stills & posters."
3,Fernando Lamas a good bad guy,"I admit - Raquel Welch, what a woman! I liked the acters in this flick. It wasn't bad. Burt Reynolds played a good wastrel. Fernando Lamas was the best though as the evil Mexican Commandant with his Colonel Klink sidekick/advisor (Victor Newman from the 'Young & the Restless'). Actually, Victor Newman, is an excellent cool actor. He should have been in more leading roles. I like his cool Prussian demeanor and would make a great stock bad guy. I was surprised that Jim Brown was able to pull it off not too bad.One of those good 70s westerns, I recommend it."
2,Buy from store next time.,I loved these when I got them at my local grocery store but the box I ordered from Amazon arrived hard and stale.
4,Good flavor.,"Great since they are peanut free. Easy to cary with you. The kids had trouble opening the packages, 3 & 5. The texture was a little tough to chew for the little ones. But as a treat they thought these were great."
2,Not as good as Kettle Valley fruit bars.,"This was on sale and I thought I would try to save a little money by buying it over the Kettle Valley brand of organic fruit bar. Well the 2 year old taste arbitrator was unimpressed. Where she devoured the Kettle Valley, she lingered over this brand (and frequently did not finish it). And it wasn't a question of the variety. She had liked all incarnations of Kettle Valley that I had purchased. She did not really like the only incarnation of this brand that was purchased. Now I'm eating the remainder and I'm unimpressed also. It is bland and waxy tasting."
2,Puts the leather in fruit leather,"I have found these bars to be dry and tough in the flavors I have tried (strawberry, grape, apricot, apple) even though they have been well within their sell-by date. This has not been the case with their non-organic fruit leathers (which are just called fruit leathers, not FruitaBu). They are really good; moist and chewy, good enough to call them a treat. So, weigh your desire for organic against their non-organic yummy less expensive product and make your own choice."
5,The Camden 28 Story Resonates Still Today,"This very even-handed presentation of the case of the Camden 28, a group of anti-war protesters (including Catholic Priests and a Protestant Minister) with plans to raid the Selective Service Office in Camden, NJ in 1971 was informative, entertaining, and moving all at the same time. The participation of many of the principals from both sides of the story gives the documentary a great deal of authority and gravitas. Those not familiar with the story will be surprised if not shocked by some revelations, but overall, you are left with a sense that the program could be talking about the United States in 2007, rather than over 35 years ago."
3,An introduction to Bob Dylan that could have been better,"I did learn a lot about my man in the '60s and early '70s. I didn't follow his career much after that, so I found this an easy way to catch up, although the DVD does not cover his comeback in 1997. Many talking heads, including various band members, and occasional short interviews from the past provided lots of little details and yet so much was left out too.The editing could have been tighter to make the 110 minutes less boring; I also didn't like the style of the choppy editing and the lack of a central narrator to fill in and make the transitions smoother and easier to follow. And why must we see the interviewer? Overall, a low budget feel to the production, like his main focus was to have fun with it.Another disappointment was the lack of any of Dylan's music actually performed by Dylan. There are some detailed reviews on line you can find by doing a Google search, if you're considering a purchase. Nice that our library had a copy to view."
3,It's just OK,"Anthing involving Bob Dylan inherently cannot be without some interest.However, this DCDE is mostly interviews with Dylan acyolites and people who knew him before he was DYLAN.Woefully little actual Dylan footage other than homemade, out of focus and soundless movies and clips of press conferences viewable in their entirety elsewhere.All in all, I hate to say it but I was bored."
4,sturdy and stylish,"i wanted these because of the cute purple color - they also fit well, very comfy. sturdy and stylish. pretty expensive for a flip-flop but worth it for their ""shoe-like"" quality and for the cute color!"
2,Temmora please!!!!,"This album was weak and in addition it didn't have any songs to make up for the one song where I know she sounds like a true artist with talent!! Has anyone heard, ""There's No Me"" with Howard Hewitt and where I could get that one? That's a song. This album really did not showcase that lovely voice I just know she has going on for herself. Step it up Temmora, there are peple listening to you now!!!!"
2,"Just Don't ""Talk To Me!"" At All!!","Temmora has a good voice but, she uses it as a weak tool. The songs on here sound like it's done by a karaoke machine. Short songs but I must say, I like her remake of one of the most popular songs around ""Mary Did You Know?"" Overall, this cd has to get a D. Temmora, you could do a whole lot better than this. Some of the good songs are ""Tryin To Play A Player"" and ""Have Faith In Me."""
3,Hoping for me,I was very excited about this movie coming out. I am a fan of Poe and I thought it was going to be more about his life as opposed to him helping to solve a murder mystery.
2,"Good Idea, Poor Execution","It was an enticing idea to use Poe for a character and should have worked.However, in spite of the talent involved and production values, it fails to deliver."
2,Ehhh,It's visually beautiful but the story line is drawn out. I thought I was going to enjoy in more. :(
3,It was ok,It was ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok. Nine more words required. Five more words. Two more got it!
4,Good movie,Purchased for my 14-year old granddaughter who is a fan of movies of this genre. She really enjoyed seeing it and owning it
3,An interesting premise of Poe's last days; more for Poe fans.,"I watched with optimism. Edgar Allen Poe was an imaginative writer.One, I didn't particularly care for, but I did enjoy some of the movies that was based on some of his stories. This movie presents an interesting premise of how Poe may have had spent tha last few days of his life. Overall, it is interesting. It has action and is fast moving. Overall, a film worthy of one viewing, especially for Poe fans."
1,The Raven,"I gave this drivel one star because there was no opportunity to give it any less. It's hard to see otherwise good actors chew up the scenery with bombastic dialogue to cover up a plot line that is so pedestrian that it shouldn't even have made it to the straight-to-video bin much less the theatre circuit. I know movies like ""The Grifters"" come along once in a great while, but Mr. Cusack did you need that new patio that badly?"
1,Audio Problem!,"Waited for this release for weeks, really looking forward to it, but DID NOT RENT due to audio issue. All other trailers I tried in Amazon (including the one for the movie I settled on) worked just fine, so it's not my computer, and it's not Amazon Instant Video, and it's not chrome. This movie, on the trailer, gave a kind of ""pop"" in the speakers followed by a high-pitch tone that would not stop until I closed the trailer. No soundtrack, no dialogue, just that awful tone. No way am I renting the movie when I have no way of knowing if it will have the same audio issue as the trailer."
3,It's okay is about it.,"OK character development. OK plot, OK acting, OK special effects, OK, OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK"
1,Eh,"Cusack overacts so much this movie is hard to watch. The premise is alright, but it feels like the film makers had watched the new Sherlock Holmes movies and were mad they didn't get there first, and shoehorned Cusack and Poe into this monstrosity in retaliation."
2,Not worth seeing.,"Dont waste your time, movie was boring and predictable. The acting was not good and John Cusack was not believable in the part as Edgar Allen Poe."
2,Weak,If managed to sit through the whole thing but it was just not that believable/entertaining. The main character was not that likable even though I like the actor.
3,Just ok,"It wasn't anything special. It was gory. John Cusak did a good job in his role, but there could have been so much more to this movie."
2,expected better,"Maybe the Poe fan might who knows nothing of the man or his work will find this to be of interest, but any prior knowledge of Poe and his works dooms this film."
3,good movie,movie was as good as Hollywood is making these days. I like John Cusack and he did a good job as usual.
3,Entertaining but...,"If you're an Edgar Allen Poe buff, you may be offended at how wrong the portrayal is! However, it was entertaining for an evening with nothing else to do!"
2,Dont buy this movie,"This is the first time I have reviewed anything. This movie is all hype, rent it if you must see for yourself. I will add this to my collection of DVD's that I wasted my money on."
2,Ugh.,"You know, I really wanted to like this movie. Having watched with no small sense of dismay the slow, methodical flame-out of John Cusack's career, hope still springs eternal that I will again see the actor I once knew and loved on the silver screen.Alas.Here's my real complaint about the film- I felt it relied too heavily on the *wink wink* of Poe references throughout the story and forgot to make the narrative in any way compelling. Cusack plays Poe at volume 11, nearly screaming every line of dialogue he has in the film. I'm guessing that was his way of interpreting Poe's alcohol addiction and macabre persona, but for me it felt overacted and at times a little cartoonish.Most of the film was forgettable for me, a cheap thrill ride with a lot of atmosphere but no real substance. I don't believe it was the intention of the movie to frighten, but I do believe it was meant to be suspenseful- in any event, on both counts it fell short."
2,Not Impressed,"The gore was slightly impressive, however the story was not. The worst was the line from the guy who finds Poe on the park bench. ""Is there someone I can call for you?"" The telephone wasn't available to the public until 1891, several decades after Poe died. My suspension of disbelief failed me. Also, Cusack's acting as himself, as he always does, wasn't all that interesting either. I've seen much better out of the 70's horror movie dollar bin than this thing."
3,foggy brain teaser,"combined anonymous and sherlock holmes movies together you get the Raven.a weak version because absolutely no background or mentioning of the publishings the murders were copied from. pretty good acting and scenes.cusack was good.how it came to the point of the story was to quick.there was no how,why, or when for us to work with. the 2 mentioned movies great compared to this one."
2,Plot overall lacks pretty much everything a fan of Poe is looking for in a story,"This movie was somewhat terrible, as a fan of Poe and some of the main actors I had to force myself to keep watching after the first 20 minutes. In retrospect I should have just caved to the urge to turn the movie off.Both the protagonist and antagonist are 1 dimensional, and the plot overall lacks pretty much everything a fan of Poe is looking for in a story."
3,Slightly disappointing...,"Love John Cusack. He was very good as were the other players, even when you consider that a couple of them are fairly new comers.I did not like the writers choice for the bad guy, it was a let down. It was blah, weak. I was impressed with their choice of filming location. It was a good choice to depict the old time historical feel of 19th century Baltimore."
4,good,"The picture and sound was great quality, the movie was good, but not as good as I had hoped it would be."
5,The Raven,This movie was much better than I had expected. I loved it and watched it 4 times! The storyline was great and the visual is excellent. John Cusack was great! I will buy this on Blue Ray as soon as it comes out!
4,good not great,John cusack is great but a supporting staff is lacking. The story line is based in reality and makes sense of the unknown about Poe's last days. The satire of those days is implied but hard to understand with out understanding the tone of society in those days. Great movie to fill a boring night if you are a history buff or like based on reality movies.
3,The Raven,"It was an interesting speculation and execution of the story was good. The story was easy to follow and the acting and the dialogues was well done. I did not get the HD version; the standard version was more than adequate. I did not think the movie as a whole was exceptional, hence the 3 star rating."
2,Silly and ridiculous,"I'm not sure why John Cusack agreed to do this movie, usually he has somewhat better taste. Then again, I guess he was in that 2012 movie, so perhaps this is just his recent trend. The Raven does seem like it has at least some kind of interesting premise and certainly has a nice visual atmosphere. Unfortunately, the positives stop there. At no point does it appear at all likely that Edgar Allan Poe was ever like this character, which seriously hampers the viewer's ability to suspend disbelief. Horrible acting made worse by a terrible script. Skip this one."
3,Poe's last days,"It's a decent hypothesis of Poe's last days; however, the film contained so many slow (dead) spots. Don't stay up late to finish watching it, you'll be able to pick up easily the next night."
4,"Quote the Raven, better than I thought it would be.","I had low expectations going into this film mostly because I didn't know much about it. Maybe it didn't get much press or I was busy when it went to the theatre. I don't know. So I rented it instead of buying it. I thought it was going to be a biopic but I was wrong. It's a really good suspense filled mystery. Cusack is interesting, charismatic, and a bit creepy. Just how imagine Poe to have been. The story is intriguing and a cool spin on the unknown final days of the author. I don't want to give a thing away about the plot with my review so I will say if you enjoy Poe, mysteries, John Cusack, or all of the above it's a decent film to check out."
3,Good Enough!,"This movie was good enough to be considered entertaining. The movie to me only passes because John Cusack is a really good actor and plays a really good Edgar Allen Poe. The rest of the actors do an alright job but the movie kind of has its slow parts. I do however have alot more respect for Poe because the movie does show how many actual good stories Poe wrote even though most were very dark. Of couse most talented artists and writers have a darkness to them. I watched this movie and was entertained by it. The picture and sound quality was really good and clear. The overall movie was average to me though. If you are into fast paced movies stay away, but if you like movies that slow down and draw out and are dark you will like this movie. I give this movie a C+."
2,"Just OK, nothing special, not really bad.","I must say that I saw actor Jeffery Coombs (Reanimator) in a play about Edgar Allen Poe and I felt he really captured the character of Poe we have all read about. I think he would have made a better star for this film that John Cusack did. That being said he did ok. But, in my opinion this film is just ok and I will never watch it again..."
3,The Raven - is for the birds... wah wahhhh,"I expected a dark, creepy serial killer flick... it was VERY DARK, somewhat creepy and yes there was a serial killer - expectations met. But when I said ""dark"" I meant scary and sadistic, not visually unseeable. That doesn't ruin the movie... John Cusack's acting does, as does everyone else's. It's just overdone and Cusack's typical quick wit/long dialogue works will in dark comedies... but not here... also I wanted blood and guts! I am a Horror fan - this barely made it.Despite the above... the costuming was beautiful, the scenes stunning. The last death scene was the most beautiful, no blood or gore... there were parts that I loved to see. I just wish overall it was done better."
2,not,I simply could not get into this film. I felt as though I had seen it before. I did not even reach the end.
3,Not what you expect.,"I anticipated a subject matter more related to Poe's life and work, but this is a fiction keyed around the circumstances of his mysteriuos death. Entertaining and imaginative."
3,with out subtitles -okay,also a big problems is that I can't share with my family because the digital recording does not have Spanish audio nor subtitles so this fact is forcing me to bay the actual disk instead. this is very bad
3,This was ok,"This was good for where I saw it at, Home. Lol not that I didn't like it but it's not something I would've paid to see in the movies as much as they cost now but fairly entertaining."
5,not a play,"this was more about the acting, the feel of your self be so right there with them , this was great acting and so realto the time, great over all movie and acting"
4,Love Poe,"Good watching, I enjoy John Cusack and love Poe. The combination was great. Worth watching again. Dark thriller. Try it."
4,Interseting.,"I found this movie interesting and enjoyable. The story is more of a morphed Edgar Allen Poe storyboard with Mr. Poe placed into the action. Its basically a detective story using some of Poe's shorts. It kept my attention throughout and was actually pretty good. I personally do not like when Hollywood destroys great literature but I'll let them slide this time as they didn't truly alter the works. For Hollywood I give them a ""F"". They still come up with nothing new. Stealing old work and twisting it to make a movie is purely lack of imagination. At least it wasn't ""Abraham Lincoln:Vampire hunter"""
4,You will watch it to the end to see who did it,The film is laid out in a way that you do not know who did it until the end. The story line grabs your attention quickly and you are guessing throughout the movie.
4,Interesting,"The movie was interesting, and I liked how they tried to explain Poe's death. Fiction? Of course, but an interesting bit of fiction that puts a new spin on things."
1,don't do it!,"as a lover of horror movies, this movie was not able to hold my interest at all, i didn't even finish the rental, sorry mr cusack, i am a big fan, just not of this movie."
2,The Raven,"I like the cast and I wanted to like it, but John Cusack was kind of annoying, and he's usually entertaining for me."
1,WHY BOTHER!,"Just terrible...sad to watch ...just because its working for Robert Downy Jr, doesn't mean its gonna work for every 90's actor."
1,Bad movie !,"Please don't watch this movie.Movie seems to be inspired by Sherlock Holmes idea but loses its path. Too much gore, very less intelligence in the plot. I love horror movies but this one is just gory with absolutely no sense."
1,Poor Poe. Now tormented by cheesy films involving his life.,"This movie doesent have much to recommend it. Poe did not have a goatee and actually looked more like John Wilkes Booth, Lincolns assassin. But worst of all is this murder by literature has been done before. The Abominable Dr Phibes and Theatre of Blood. Both starring Vincent Price and both based on literature, in the case of those movies it was the Biblical Plagues and Shakespeare. Cusack is a disaster in this film, well he didnt help it thats a certainty."
1,Wait until you can watch it for free,"If I could, I would have demanded a refund. I am not going to pretend I'm a movie critic, it simply was a lame movie."
3,Not theater worthy but still a good movie,"The Raven stayed true to John Cusak movie fashion - erie and dark at times. Without giving the movie away I would've liked to seen the movie stay a bit truer to Poe's works but all in all I think it was a good representation for the storyline of the film. Not quite a ""blockbuster"" but if you're a Cusak fan you will like this one."
4,Good suspense thriller,We really enjoyed this movie. John Cusack was great. Keeps you guessing. I don't think you have to be a Poe fan to enjoy this flick.
3,Interesting,It was good to watch and interesting how they pulled all of Edgar Allen Poe's most recognized stories. I enjoyed watching and was a good crime drama.
3,Very good,This movie was far better than I expected. Cusack performs very well. It has a Sherlock Holmes type of feel to it.
5,raven,"Great movie, well worth the watch. Dark and mysterious has some funny parts to it also. well acted and the plot is great. don't know who dun it until the end. Recommend it for those that don't mind dark movies."
4,Not bad,The movie left something to be desired. The premise was good but it didn't follow through as it could have
2,'Nevermore',"Although this film starts out like a biography of the life of Edgar Allen Poe, it soon becomes a Sherlock Holmes-esque thriller. The producers must not have realized that a film based solely on the life of Edgar Allen Poe would be interesting enough. Too bad they didn't make THAT film!"
2,disappointing,generally love Cusack and was surprised I didn't hear more about this movie...until I watched it. Wasnt worth the rental fee.
3,John Cusack is good in everything he does.,I think he was the best part of this movie. Story was interesting but could have been more action packed I think.
3,Hi,It was a little slow to begin with but definantly great ending. not what I expected when I ordered the movie
2,Lame and Confusing,I love movies and love action thrillers. This one fairly predictable and really bad editing. I would wait for netflix or amazon prime for this one.
2,Blah,"It was ok for a rental, but just ok. The movie seem disjointed and never really went anywhere in my opinion. I usually like Cusak films, but this one just didn't do it for me."
3,Hard to understand,This movie was very hard for me to keep up with and understand what was going on. It gets really involved and I just dont think it was my kind of movie.
3,An OK Movie,"I enjoyed this movie as best as anyone who has no idea how Poe may have behaved during his life. I don't think that John Cusack was the best choice for the role however, as some of the acting seemed to be lackluster in performance. The overall story was pretty enjoyable and entertaining when you take this piece of fiction with a grain of salt. Definitely a rental unless it speaks to you more than it did me."
3,The Raven,"The gore and thriller factor in the movie was fitting for a horror-like flick; however, the big disapointment in this movie was the portrayal of Edgar Allan Poe, which just seemed off. He embodied the image of a self-obsessed alcoholic. The other problem: there is only one possible killer introduced early in the film, so within the first 20 minutes or so, you know who is behind the murders. It should have been harder to guess. Some more subplot development would have helped in that arena. But hey, who doesn't like John Cusack? And he did have a pet raccoon, which was one of few endearing qualities of Poe in this film. Again, not amazing, but not terrible. A worthwhile rent if you are a Cusack fan, but not if you are a fan of Poe."
2,Slow,I fell asleep one third into the movie. Maybe it ends better than it started? Dark start. Felt like. Sherlock homes setting.
2,Another movie pretending to be more than it is...,"Watched an hour and couldn't watch anymore. Nonplussed storyline and empty characters. Usually I love John Cusack, but this was BORING!"
2,It simply didn't hold my attention.,I love Edgar Allen Poe but I found it difficult to like this character. Perhaps it was too dark and predictable I wasn't even able to finish the movie because I just lost interest in the characters..
2,the raven,Is ok ..is not what I expect ....but no to wacht again two star john cusack he is a good actor you expect better movie for him..
5,Intense.,"I'd recommend this movie to anyone. I hope they come out with a series. Give it a watch. However the requirement to write a review as apposed to just rating it with stars if VERY annoying AMAZON. If a person going to trust a review; then a STAR RATING is satisfactory... When I rate my movie rental using my smart phone, it makes this process EXTREMELY challenging. And my smart phone is what I use most of the time; so you might want to rethink your rating requirement to make is more user friendly."
4,Cusack is the coolest.,A little slow at times. Cusack is brilliant as always. Just wish the pace was a little quicker.Good flick though.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I was disappointed because I thought it would show Edgar Allen Poe in a different light. I love his stories andhe is one of my favorite authors. But it really showed him as a drunk (and even if he was, I would have liked itto have been more favorable to him). I did not like the ending at all and I thought it was a very bad use of theacting skills of John Cusak, who is an awesome actor."
2,SO BORING!,"I ""rented"" this on instant watch and I only got about half way through and I was bored to death! Horrible."
4,Underrated movie,This movie pretty much flopped when it came out in theaters and the reviews were not much better but I have to admit it was pretty good. I think this might get to be a cult classic in the future. John Cusak plays Edgar Allen poe and he is tasked with helping the police find a serial killer who is killing people based on Poe's stories and poems. Like I said it was a pretty good movie and reminded me of Seven.
3,"Good, if you like poe.","This is a good movie. It has good suspense and mystery to it. Kind of like a ""who-dun-it"". If you like Edgar Allen Poe, you will like this."
5,Awesome Movie!,"Yes the movie is fiction. Yes, it is not ""real life"". It is a ""maybe"" of what Poe's last days were like. And John Cusack was awesome in the role of Poe. I do not think they could have picked anyone better."
3,raven,entertaining. easy to use. As far as the movie I am sure that there are many other reviewers out there that can give a more appealing review than what I am capable of.
4,Mystery was exciting.,"Good screen play. Hard to figure out the upcoming ending. This was very good for all concerned. Impressive, yes it was."
4,interesting,"cool movie. if you're an avid edgar allen poe fan, you'd like it a LOT more. i felt like it was a good thing i've read everything edgar allen poe wrote otherwise you'd be missing have the fun of the movie."
3,okay,"long movie...not very exciting at all. I was slow moving and I found myself surfing the web on my laptop, it lost my attention 1/2 way through."
2,It just couldn't keep me interested,"I don't know, right now. As it's been a few days since I watched it. But that's another way to say, I don't remember much. I liked the idea, I liked the actors.Production values were high. Script, I guess, failed."
1,I was SO bored,"I LOVE Edgar Allen Poe, so I really WANTED to like this movie, but for whatever reason, I was SO BORED! I couldn't get into the movie and then about 1/2 through I jumped on Facebook to see what other people were doing, because that had to be more interesting than the movie I was watching. That being said, my spouse really liked the movie, so there is no accounting for taste."
1,Had good potential but failed completely.,"Wanted to give this a zero star. Since this is not possible, I give it a one star for all the jobs it provided in the making.Read a book about 10 years ago entitled 'Nevermore'. Brilliantly written by true crime author, Harold Schecter, he craftily manages two characters, Davy Crocket and Edgar Allen Poe as they try to solve a number of grisly murders. The murders are similar to those committed in 'The Raven'. Where 'Nevermore' is extremely well done and the odd couple compliment each other in 1834 Baltimore, 'The Raven' is disjointed, and uneven. Furthermore, the acting is horrible. The idea for the film is clever and could have been compelling, as was the case in 'Nevermore'. 'The Raven' is a complete flop."
3,Edgar Allan Poe: The Real Sherlock Holmes?,"The Raven was a much more enjoyable experience than all the negative reviews that I read from the critics lead me to believe. A serial killer is dispatching people in the same fashion as the victims in the works of the 18th century poet Edgar Allan Poe. The police are stumped, so they call upon the brooding man himself. Think Abraham Licoln Vampire Hunter meets Sherlock Holmes, you know, a real historical figure's life changed for entertainment value. John Cusack does a very good job playing Edgar Allan Poe, injecting Poe's personality traits in often humerous ways and his hatred for rival writers of the time. John Hawkes is my choice for a true telling of Poe's life, but Cusack fits the part in this fictional take on the last few days of the poet's life.The Raven is not great or really that memorable, but the atmosphere, mystery and John Cusack's performance held my interest enough to recommend seeing it once it hits DVD."
3,"Movie was ok, but not great!",The plot lacked a little bit and the story was foreseeable. Would probably not want to watch this movie again.
2,Poor,The movie was passable at best. The plot was stupid. The death scenes were OK but it didn't make up for the ridiculousness of the rest of the movie.
2,eh movie,i like a good john cusack movie but this one was not what i expected. i actually fell asleep during this in the middle of the day.
3,Pretty Good,"Quite suspenseful, intelligent, interesting, has a twist, keep the watcher intrigued and guessing. It was overall a pretty entertaining film."
3,Review of The Raven,Movie was ok but the acting was sometimes just to hammy. Not one of Cusack's better jobs.KenWebmasterAbout Facts Net
4,Cool spin on Poe,"Im a fan of Poe and this movie is good, but kind of makes the legacy of Poe seem soft and portrays him as a punk. Maybe thats how he was? lol anyhow, I enjoyed this film"
4,Good Action mystery,"Enjoyed this movie when I first watched it on Netflix. If you enjoy some of the darker mystery action movies like The Bone Collector, this one should be something you'll enjoy too. This copy includes both DVD, Blu-ray and a digital copy, purchased as a start on Blu-ray, even though at the time I did not have a Blu-ray player."
3,The Raven,"Not a bad movie, not a lot of gruesome, gratuitous or exploitation scenes if that's what your expecting. It has descent suspense and a fair ending overall a 3 star movie. Not a bad rental."
2,I was so disappointed!,"It started off pretty good. I liked all the historical accuracy and what looked like the actual cobblestone of today's historical Baltimore. I thought that it was cute that he had a pet raccoon and petted a dead rodent in the street. This all being an allusion to the conspiracy theory that, perhaps, Poe died from rabies. It was slighty fun to see him argue in a bar. I really like all of the trivia and literary allusion. But it just was stupid and it dragged on. I honestly don't remember how it ended. It wasn't very well made. And Poe as the red hot lover of the blonde actress with the constantly heaving breasts was pretty unbelievable and kind of gross. Disappointing because my video rental lady said that she loved it. I want my money back! Oh, and by the way, I'm an English teacher, even though I used the vernacular!:) So I enjoyed some of the clever details like the pet raccoon which I do think is made up, but funny, because of the rabies rumor."
2,Not very good,"scenes looked as if they made too much movie and were slapped together, disjointed and not very good thriller with odd story"
3,"Not bad, just okay","While watching the show, I was intrigued and my eyes were glued to the set. That isn't too difficult though, because I'm easily entertained by the television. Usually the best judge for a movie for me, is if I'm still thinking about it later on or the next day. This one was very forgettable. I forgot I even watched it until I got this email asking me to review it."
3,Nevermore...,"It's very strange how some films are actually quite good and there's not much to criticise at all but still...you feel like something was missing. Cusack is excellent as Poe. The film is very well executed overall, the editing, music, story, everything is in it's proper place but nevertheless the movie leaves you with a certain dissatisfaction and it's difficult to say why. I would recommend it as what it is: a fine, suspenseful crime story. I always was a big fan of Mr. Poe (he was a true poet and a truly great writer) and an admirer of John Cusack, so seeing him in this role was of course a very exciting thing for me but be advised: If you are not too familiar with the life and death of Edgar Allan Poe and his literary work, this film probably won't make a lot of sense to you.."
3,Okay.......,I don't know... when this movie was beginning to spark my interest and appear to really get good... it was over....
2,More guts then glory,"I kept watching this thinking: ""is that really how Poe would have acted?"" I don't know of course, but I guess I'm saying it felt cheesy or fake. Great if you like seeing guys sliced slowly in half by a pendulum blade."
4,Entertaining,It was fun going thru the movie and realizing fairly quickly the m'o' of the killer. Don't want to say too much lest I give away the plot. Nevermore.
2,bad,Not a good movie. Actor sucked. WOULD NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE AGAIN> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY
4,Witty take on the end of Poe,Although a stretch on Poe’s life story it was plausible. Using his stories as the story line for a killer and his Mad antics was a good attempt at creating a story. Period piece with some GREAT sets and wardrobe.
2,not worth it.,I was greatly Disappointed in this film and I am at least grateful that i did not buy it on DVD because this was a major let down in every sense of the word.
4,Steampunk,"Entertaining, beautiful sets and pretty intriguing. I like Cusack a lot, but I hardly ever like his movies. This one is good."
5,Hot to Trot!,"I was looking for the perfect spicy red shoe to brighten up a conservative black and white dress for an evening wedding and these are perfect!The 9 was snug, 9.5 too big so I advise stretching your normal size a little and wearing them a bit before you head out for the evening...very hot hot hot! And not too pricy!Very Louboutin inspired..."
5,Stunning book on many levels,"A stunning integration of photography, biography, history, and spiritual teachings, this book touches readers on many levels. The images, from the expansive landscapes of Tibet, to the intimate features of Tibetan faces, are inspiring and telling. The biography, of one of the great spiritual teachers of the past century, is fascinating. (What actually transforms in a human being who spends decades in solitary meditation?) The history of what happened when China invaded Tibet and proceeded to decimate its culture is necessary, dramatic, harrowing. The spiritual teachings are sublime, yet accessible to those of all faiths. A rare book: beautiful, compelling, liberating...."
1,Deceptive Advertising,"The picture shows five reducing washers for a very low price but the shipping is way too much and under product features it shows the following:Product FeaturesReplacement Steel Arbor Bushings5/8"" Inside Diameter x 1"" Outside DiameterUsed with steel and carbide tipped bladesas you can see it says bushings not singular bushingWell I got one ""bushing"" that's it ONE!!! This was as close to theft as you can get and I will complain bitterly to Amazon"
5,Parchment Papr,I ordered this 500 sheet parchment paper yesterday evening and recieved it this morning. I've never had such quick delivery and the product is an excellent quality as well. I use it for my calligraphy and it is the best value for the quality. I will definitely be buying this product again.
4,Domain - Last Days of Utopia,"I bought this cd 'cus it was limited editon to 4,000 and had a bonus cd, a poster and a sticker. The cover artwork is quite eye-catching, so I thought I'd give it a try. The sticker on the cd it said it was a conceptual melodic metal masterpiece and this is true. I've always been a fan of concept albums, and this album delivers from heaviness to melodic metal. With great orchestrations, great guitar work and an outstanding drummer, with a rememberable vocalists. With all the bonuses this is a must have for people who like a story to go along with their music."
5,Didn't get the chance it deserved!,"I was already a die-hard Aaron Sorkin fan from West Wing and had high hopes for Studio 60. I had even planned to watch some episodes with friends who were also West Wing fans, but alas they jumped ship. I missed a few episodes here and there and before I knew it,it was canceled. I bought the series from Amazon(at $41.99,I might add) and watched every episode. It was then that I realized what a terrible loss it was for this show to fold. As others have said already, a show too smart for the ""reality show"" public. I guess we get what we deserve. I feel like I deserve more well written,well acted,smart Aaron Sorkin projects. I still wish Studio 60 would have continued."
5,Studio 60 on the sunset strip,"Studio 60 is one of the best television shows i have ever seen. The fact that it was only on for one season just validates what the show is about. This show is whitty, dry, hillarious, and thought provoking. It pokes at the nescience of the tv watching public and could not be more accurate. I could not more strongly recomend this show."
5,BRING IT BACK!,"My husband and I are huge fans of S.60. I am baffled as to why such an intelligent show was cancelled after it's 1st season-to be replaced by, what,another horrid reality show about how 20-something women are competing against 40-something women over a guy? HUH?! What is NBC thinking? Trash shows are taking over the tube and the good ones are cancelled. If there is a petition out there to get Studio 60 back please let me know-we'd sign it in a heartbeat. As far as we're concerned if another good show like Jericho can make a comeback so can Studio 60!"
5,I Miss Studio 60,"Studio 60 was created by the same guy who did West Wing and it was every bit as great. It was a wonderful, intelligent show highlighting interpersonal relationships is a high pressure world of live television. It's only failure was that it was too intelligent for most viewers in that it's dialogue moved too quickly for most people to follow and it was probably a bit too liberal in it's world views. If you've got a quick wit and open mind, you would probably enjoy this show which only lasted one season. Cudos to ABC for having the guts to air it."
2,"Good cast, strange show.","The writing, especially the later shows, was very good. The cast meshed early on and it just got better with each episode. They even tried to show both sides to an issue a few times. There were jokes, ironic stories, lots of ironic stories, but no actual comedy sketches. You would tend to think they'd throw one in on occasion as this was supposed to be a show about a ""Saturday Night Live"" type show based out of LA. Instead it came off as The West Wing via the Sunset Strip. That could be why it failed. I'll miss the cast and hope they all find work."
2,Predictable,"A former employer once rejected a recommendation stating ""if those changes are necessary, there are better businesses to be in."" Such is the philosophy of Mr. Sorkin, the creative half of Team '69. He just can't resist the compulsion to show everyone he is the smartest man in ""the room"" and still owns the patent on glib. He and Mr. Schlamme were given the opportunity to present real insight and courage (e.g., a Jeopardy parody with Jesus, Mohammed and Moses). Instead they gave NBC nothing more than a Public Service Announcement with commensurate ratings.Nevertheless the effort is not totally without merit. I believe one actor will rise to ""A List"" heights from the long forgotten ashes of Studio 60. Sarah Paulson where have you been? You deserve better, don't be afraid to ask for it!"
1,"high hopes, but boring show",The producers definitely do not know what they want; the best episodes are worse than West Wing season 7 worst episodes. The actors are OK; the story ? they want political or behind the scene expose the secrets sort of documentary drama. It seemed that in the end they are not sure.
5,FINALLY!!!,"Aha!!I was waiting & waiting for this to be released on DVD and now it is released in time for me to buy it in the guise of a Christmas present for my husband (although it's really for meeeee!...err, I mean him) Now we can watch this clever, clever show over & over and fall right back into the witty, face-paced, extremely well-written backstage world of Studio 60....and pretend it never ended. Of course, my friends want it too...maybe I'll just buy this Studio 60 DVD for everyone I know. Ok, cool. Christmas shopping done."
3,Art mirroring life,"This is really two series glued together. The ""first series,"" which runs to about half way, is theseries Aaron Sorkin and co. intended. And it's truly brilliant, at times even breathtaking.Sadly, the ""second series"" is lamentably bad -- clearly the suits (the Jack Rudolphs and sub-JackRudolphs) had decided that the show had to be ""fixed up"" and all the usual manipulative devicesare wheeled out to try to make that happen. It's truly embarrassing to watch and those responsibleshould be utterly ashamed of themselves. As William Burroughs once put it, ""The machine eats up qualityand [excretes] quantity""."
5,Head and shoulders above most other TV,"Having recently finished watching this series on DVD, I am amazed at how great a show it was and disappointed that it lasted so short a time. It sounds like hyperbole, but this is really what television should be like - only a handful of shows ever reach this level of intelligence and emotional depth.Fast-paced intelligent adult drama that concerns real issues involving characters with honor and dignity. Even characters that you dislike end up stepping up to the plate and showing their mettle. And it's often very funny as well. Sorkin clearly loves all his characters and is careful to treat them all with respect (and how often does one see that on TV?).Although cancelled fairly early, the writers did manage to round off the series at the end, so have no fear that you'll be left hanging at the end of the series."
2,Medicore TV - Fascinating Psychology,"Studio 60 never quite found itself as a TV show. However, as a view into post-breakup angst, it was fascinating.Aaron Sorkin and Kristen Chenoweth (TV Producer & Talented Christian Star) had ended a romantic relationship. Studio 60 follows a TV Producer & Talented Christan Star. He tries to get her back, even though they have some pretty serious irreconcilable differences. As Sorkin writes this couple, the show feels almost like stalking. Art may have suffered, but the insight into some very private issues was stunning and creepy.Eventually, the TV Producer & Talented Christian Star go their separate ways. On and off screen. But by this time, Sorkin has created an alternate couple (Other TV Producer & Network Executive) who he uses to fulfill his ""running off into the sunset"" fantasy."
4,Wish there were more seasons,"I really enjoyed this series, only wish there were more episodes available to watch. Another great show canceled far too soon!"
2,A Huge Disappointment,"I absolutely adored The West Wing, so I was naturally very excited for Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Sadly, however, the series was just plain bad.Exhibit A: Bradely Whitford. He plays essentially the exact same character he played in The West Wing. It's sad that this wasn't a more defined character, especially as it is far less entertaining without a Donna type character.Exhibit B: Humor. The West Wing had a great dry wit to it, and often would cause you to laugh out loud at least once an episode. Strange, then, that a show about comedy writers wasn't more funny. Studio 60 does have its funny moments, but on the whole it takes itself far, far too seriously.Exhibit C: Sorkin's Soapbox. So, so, soooooo many episodes revolved around Christianity. I don't mind this. But I DO mind that 1) The approach taken to it isn't particularly intelligent or interesting and 2) It comes up so freaking much. C'mon, Sorkin. Surely you can think of other things to write about."
1,The chauvinism continues,"In this episode, a former employee has accused the show of a violation of fair employment laws after she was fired, allegedly for resisting sexual harassment, and for not fitting in to the good old boys club on the show. In the show's portrayal, a good old boys club atmosphere in a writer's room is not a problem, co-workers having sexually exploitive relationships with writers is not a problem, and men on the show talking obscenely about the ways that they would like to have sex with a woman on the show is only a problem because she is dating a man on the show and they are being bad friends to him. Come on! I can't really imagine how the women who work on this show didn't walk of the set at this point."
2,Studio 60 at hte sunset strip,Well i see why this was so cheap. The first two episodes kept automatically changing from wide screen to reg size screen. It was very distracting to watch. I loved this series and was very disappointed that I couldn't just sit down and watch it. It was the quality of someone bootlegging it of the internet. I don't know that I would buy this brand again.
4,Incredible TV show,"I like Aaron Sorkin a lot and this show has his soul, no doubt. If you enjoy with powerful dialogues that's your show too."
5,cannot believe they took this off the air!,"This show is one of a few well-written series that rivals the West Wing (plot, character development, acting, etc.) and I can only think that it did not run longer because reality shows have much lower overhead (no writes or actors to pay), making reality TV a better profitability decision for the existing delivery mechanism of free TV. I would gladly pay $2 per episode of more Studio 60!!!"
5,My Favorite New Show Since the Gilmore Girls,"I am beyond sad that nbc never gave this show a chance to build it's audience & cancelled it after 1 season. It was an intelligently written show with a lot of heart & a great cast. I am glad they're releasing it on dvd so that when my tv screen is clogged with 100's of new lame reality shows, I'll have something to watch that reminds me there are still people with talent in Hollywood - if only the networks would give them a chance & let them shine. Some of us (I suspect most of us) still want something of substance to entertain us. Thank you Studio 60 for giving us a few fleeting moments of joy. You'll be missed."
4,Online video,I purchased my favorite episode. It is fun to watch but not a very good quality as it would be from a dvd.
5,Studio 60,"If you like ""behind the scenes"" type shows with excellent writing and solid acting, you'll like ""Studio 60."" You'll forget that Matthew Perry ever played a doofus like Chandler Bing and you'll remember that you really liked Brad Whitford on ""The West Wing."" They have great chemistry and wonderful material to work with. LOVED this show when it aired and was sad to see it end so soon. I'm thrilled to have the series on DVD. What a great Christmas gift (and at a great price)."
5,Another well done Sorkin series,"I don't understand why this series was canceled and 30 Rock survived. This is so much better written. I watch this on Amazon video and like it so much I bought the series. Unlike the one joke caricatures on 30 Rock the roles are written intelligent and deep. Sarah Paulson's role as a christian and Steven Webber's as a executive were written with great skill. The two stars had great chemistry. Like Firefly and Sports Night, it ended way too soon."
5,One of my favorite shows,"Although this series is starting to show it's age a little bit (Episodes about Katrina, and Gulf War invasion) it is a super funny and topical show. Almost a time capsule of the recent past. I wish this show would have stayed on past the first season. It had so much potential."
3,studio 60 on sunset strip,I enjoyed this series but I did find it got boring at times but I am glad that I watched it as I think Matthew Perry is great
5,If you loved The West Wing!,If you are an Aaron Sorkin fan and loved The West Wing and Sportsnight then you will love this one. Just fabulous.
5,good filler,This is the best filler of episodes yet because the buu saga is still coming and lets face it the garlic JR. filler was really boring.Now back to the subject i love the part where Goku goes SSJ and uses the super kaioken attack on Pikkuin.They also changed the narator and the voices are very well dubbed.
4,Go Goku!,They went through the battle scenes pretty fast but it was fun to watch anyway. The music is different and I was happy to see the TV announcer back. I'm glad I didn't wait until fall to watch this!!! I only give it a four because I hardly give any thing a five. This IS a good tape to buy.
4,Not packed well.,"During shipping, the loose pieces banged against each other, so they had very small marks on them. I know silverware gets these marks as you use it, but you shouldn't have to buy it already dinged.BUT, great price! I have to admit, I would buy it here again."
4,Strange but wonderful,"Well, that shade of green is certainly not my favorite color, but regardless, this book is fabulous! The most imaginative and wonderful collection of stories and poems that I have ever read. Exciting, funny and heartwarming all at the same time. If that shade of green were not so hideous, I would have given it five stars easy. LOL. Still a good read."
3,Lots of fun!,I've seen this film about 8 times & it's lots of fun to watch with people with a sense of humor to match my own.
4,"Forget the ammo, pass the laughs.",An early Bill Paxton move that is on my list of movies I never saw enough of. Tim Curry's rendition of the televangelist who's name escapes me is classic (it is my favorite Curry role).
4,A soundtrack to an imaginary film,"If ""Deco"" isn't quite as strong as In the Nursery's prior album, ""Anatomy of a Poet,"" it's not the band's fault. After all, how do you follow up a masterpiece? ""Deco"" finds twin brothers Klive and Nigel Humberstone further exploring the trip-hop sound they dipped their feet into on ""Anatomy of a Poet"" while still clinging to the expansive, symphonic feel of their past work. It's not so much that ITN wow you with each song--although they almost uniformly do--it's that they show you how great music can be. It's captivating, timeless stuff that can't help triggering the imagination."
4,Great Inspiration,"This is not a how to book, but a beautiful collection of photographs that have been inspiring to browse. The text is moderately helpful, if you plan to hire a professional contractor and does offer some nice design ideas. We bought several different books and a dvd, all of which are helping us plan our own timberframe home that we hope to build within a couple yrs."
5,niceness to the max!,"Lover's rock does not come any sweeter than this. Richie Stephens sets the tone with the first track on the compilation. That track has created ""X-amount"" of hysteria in the studio and among listeners, judging by the number of phone calls I get each time I play it on my radio show. Shinehead, Pam Hall, Ambelique, Singing Melody and an artist I have not heard of prior to this; Nikesha all represent in 'ah rockers style an' fashaan' to the max. Also, Luciano keeps concious reggae in perspective with ULTERIOR MOTIVE. You'll love this if you are a lover of lover's reggae. Just trust me."
4,great flick,true story from the gulf war in 91. shows why the British sas are the best operators in the world.
5,Must see movie,"If you like true stories of courage this is a must see ,an incredible movie that gives you a good perspective of what our armed forces deal with in battle ."
3,DVD bought unwittingly from Sweden,I bought a copy of Bravo Two Zero thinking it was coming from the UK. It came from Sweden and I had to pay an additional 12 customs charge at the Post Office.This proved to be an expensive lesson.To top that the copy looks like a copy. The packaging although intact it does not have the same quality as an original. The item plays well enough but a pirate copy turned out twice as expensive as a real one.Lesson learnt - Don't buy DVDs off Amazon
4,Bravo Two Zero,Very good action movie. Great acting by Mr Bean. Very different to see him in a modern day military movie as an enlisted man instead of a Major of Wellington's army.
5,"Gulf War, down and dirty","You'll never think of the Gulf War the same way after watching this harrowing, documentary-style account of an SAS squad dropped behind Iraqi lines to hunt Scud missiles. It's an intelligent, understated BBC production, so forget the cheesy cover art and snap up a rental at your local Blockbuster. No sneering villain chops for Sean Bean here; it's great to see him in an heroic role that would really be Oscar-caliber if films like this made it to theatrical release. These may be the only guys who fought the Gulf War on foot, and you'll feel like you're right there with them. A must-see war story."
3,"Fairly Good Movie, but accurate?","I have seen both this movie and ""The One That Got Away"" (the story of Chris Ryan's escape from the Bravo-Two-Zero debacle).All in all, it's an okay action movie. Sean Bean plays a good role, and the banter, mannerisms and attitudes protrayed in the film are fairly typical of UK servicemen. The story does seem a little slow in places, but in general I thought it was a better production than ""The One That Got Away"". Definately a movie for guys.However, whether the story is a true representation of events will probably never be fully known. Chris Ryan paints a different picture of McNab and events surrounding the mission, and an excellent book, titled ""Eye of the Storm"" (by Peter Ratcliffe, the RSM of 22SAS during the Gulf War) gives yet another and uncomplimentary view of both McNab's and Ryan's versions."
3,Great Story - Low Budget Movie,"A great story told on a ""made for TV"" budget.The film looks and feels right. It doesn't have the Hollywood blockbuster special effects and cast, but real life doesn't either. Actual footage is interspersed which gives it a documentary feel. If you have read the book, Bravo Two-Zero by Andy McNab, you will be able to follow along quite easily.On the downside, they tried to cram too much of the book into the movie. There are scenes that seem to have been done only because they were `in the book"" and not because they add to the story. The acting is average and some of the special effects cheesy.If you read and enjoyed the book then you should follow-up with the movie. If your only interest is to be entertained, then you may be disappointed."
5,"Finally, a realistic war movie","This movie is British and is superb. Had Hollywood done the thing, it would be full of cheesy dialog and even worse: slow motion. As it stands, however, the movie contains great acting and follows the book by Andy McNab almost perfectly, without the over-dramatic Hollywood car chases, slow-mo explosion shots, slo-mo shouts of ""NOOOOOOOOO"", etc. Hopefully it is soon released on DVD as it is a rare gem."
3,Needs a remake!,"Have read the book several times along with ""The Walk In"" by Chris Ryan. Having been to the exact places where they made their trek across western Iraq, I can relate to their misery in the cold and sand. The movie was straight with the book but was obviously done on a very low budget. Also, if you don't understand the ""Queen's English"", you may have trouble understanding some of the movie. This movie could be re-done and it could be alot better."
1,A could have been.,"As ex-infantry I found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable. This low budget movie spoils the book. A supposed highlight is the SAS field craft, but that's a bad joke. The SAS troop crowds around for camera shots, all the while talking loudly if not shouting. Bog normal infantry don't do this never mind the best of the best, the SAS. The fire-fight sequences are passable. The interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but can't make up for the rest of it. The foul language Even if it's what they used in the field, should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot, making it unsuitable for many audiences."
2,Rather disappointing,"It's hard to believe that they could make something as fundamentally interesting as the SAS's Bravo Two Zero raid so dull.The basic facts are well-known - that Andy McNab's team were dropped behind Iraqi lines in the Gulf War to find and destroy the Scud missiles being fired at Israel, the mission went wrong almost immediately and they had to fight their way to freedom. They failed and were imprisoned but became the most decorated patrol in SAS history.With such background and a charismatic lead in the hard as nails Sean Bean you have to ask where it all went wrong. It's just poorly scripted, badly acted, confusing and a real mess. Chris Ryan's story - filmed as The One That Got Away - was a considerably better effort."
2,Not very enjoyable,"I bought this DVD with high expectations and was very disappointed. The video quality is very poor--even for a movie made for television.What I expected was a fast paced military adventure film;not a thinly veiled propaganda screed. Another gripe I have about this particular film is that the British actors speak so quickly and with such accent that I lost alot of the dialogue. I have a very high regard for the star , Sean Bean , from the Richard Sharpe series of about 10 years ago , but in this film he winds up looking like a serving of hamburger helper from all of the beatings he absorbs in Iraqi captivity. Not a pleasant film to view , and DEFINITELY not for younger viewers.I have never reviewed a film in a really negative manner before , but unfortunately , this one desereves it. Barely 2 stars. Not recommended.Save your money on this one."
3,Amazon.com's Editorial Review has a mistake in it...,"I haven't seen this flick, so I have no opinion on it. I just wanted to point out that Sean Bean HAS been in a major film. He played Boromir in Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."
5,The BEST Source on Wonder Wonman,"This book has more info on the Amazing Amazon.com than any other!Read about her creator,Charles Moulton.See comic book covers down through the years.Find beautiful drawings and photographs.I've had this book for over a year and I can't stop reading it!This is a MUST!A Wonder Woman collection isn't complete without this book."
4,Fun book but a couple mistakes...,"First off, loved the book. It was nice to read the comments from Lynda Carter and see the multitude of changes that WW has gone through. But I did notice two things, the actress that played Wonder Woman's mother in that tiny demo in the 60's was named Maudie Pricket and the photo of Ms. Carter's costume says it is from the first season and it's not, it's from the CBS years as are the bracelets and tiara on the following page. I know Ms. Carter preferred the CBS years updated costume but the original on worn while fighting Nazis in the more humorous years will always be my absolute favorite! Thanx..."
4,Great,THis is a good video. It shows Chi Chi meeting Videl for the first time. It also shows Krillin with hair and his little daughter Marron and Android 18 his wife. Also it shows how much of a brat Trunks is. Goten is found to have the family secret down good also. Get this because its priceless.
1,This show.....,"Is stupid and annoying. One word for Gohan's love interest ""Witch""or ""Evil incarnate"".Strong words. Gohan ""moron"" amazing they rhyme.Really lame. Eat some Fruit Loops and Cocoa Puffs more intellectually sound than this drivel."
2,Sunflower seeds are tasteless,"I had no idea that totally ""organic"" could mean totally ""tasteless."" The best thing that these can be used for is in cooking oriental dishes or making salads."
1,Musical genius,"This Cd is among the best rap cd's ever to be produced. And I say this in all sincerity. The beats and melodies that accompany the banging lyrics that will make you laugh till you cry are mixed into a wonderful composition. The west coast sounds a quite recognizable, and Eazy E sounds like no other. the best tracks on this Cd are sippin on a 40, gangsta beat 4 tha streets, and the muthfu**in real. Eazy e is incomparable, and inimmitable. he created a whole new angle for rap, and always spoke his mind. he was quite a guy, and he is missed by many. R.I.P homeboy, yo manager."
4,Every Year,"This is an annual purchase.I love this calendar.It has an exhaustive list of holidays, some wonderful art, some peaceful sayings.What more could one ask of a calendar?!"
1,Great Idea...Poor Implementation,"This book looks wonderful and the quilts the author has made are beautiful, however the directions for the ""origami"" are nearly incomprehensible. I have become completely frustrated by the written instructions and the drawings only make sense on the first few steps of each project. An origami duck, which should take 15 minutes to produce, had four adults completely stumped for an hour. I only recommend this book if the author comes with it to explain how the pieces are made. Perhaps a video would be a good solution."
2,Beautiful Photos: Directions lacking,"My mother bought this book. She gave up in frustration over the simple fish. I tried and got stuck on step 5 or so. The diagrams are not clear. THE FABRIC IS FOLDED which way? I attempted the instructions with paper and still could not complete it. I was able to do another of the projects, in paper only. I think the author could have used better diagrams or the series of photos illustrating hands, material and folds. I found better explanations online(free) while researching.The ideas are wonderful. The photos are enticing and beautiful. If you have issues with frustration, don't bother."
1,Horrible Instructions!,"This book has great photos of finished products; however, the instructions for recreating the origami portions are absolutely worthless! I would definitely NOT recommend this book to anyone who is not already an origami expert!"
1,Pretty picture book; Impossible to follow directions,"There are lots of beautiful pictures, but the directions are impossible to follow, just horrible. The cats look like dachsunds, the fish seems to be wearing a scarf, and I never found the ""snail"" in the picture at the end of the book. Seriously, does no one test the directions? Or proof-read before publishing?The origami are tacked onto the quilts like afterthoughts, when they could be incorporated into the designs, or at least the seams, in many cases.Overall a very poor effort, only good for the coffee table and conversation about what not to do when writing a quilting book."
4,Challenging,"I was very pleased with the book, however, as a beginner quilter, I like to wait a bit more, before attacking "" Origami with Fabric"", it looks a bit complicated to me."
2,Lightweight!,"VERY lightweight item - it keeps blowing over in my yard, no matter what I use to try to secure it. Also, the gray exterior chips off revealing the styrofoam interior.Much better for indoor/prop usage than outdoor decor."
2,Trend Following,"You will need deep pockets and a strong stomach for wipsaws inorder to succeed with a somewhat subjective method. It may be useful as a confirming directional tool, but so are simple moving averages. I was disappointed and found the method incompatible."
5,Trading Day by Day:,Chick Goslin brings decades of experience and success sharing his day trading techniques. He is knowledgeable and credible. I enjoyed the book and found his methodology useful and profitable. I highly recommend his book.
2,Not what I was led to expect,".. I read many of the reviews (on this page) about this cd, and was quite impressed by what people had to say. When I brought the cd home, however, I realized I had been misled. This cd is hokey. I was expecting something lush, even emotional, maybe similar to Chicane, Synaesthesia, maybe with a bit of Enya-like dreaminess thrown in. But no, it was just hokey."
5,i saw you play live in LA,"I was very lucky to see you play live in LA last year when i was out there,so i went out an go your album ,its great !!!many of my friends think the album was spot on too,the only other band i really liked on the bigtop tour was EMPIRION,they rocked the house dude !!!!!!!keep up the good work,PEACE."
1,Unreliable and difficult to use.,"Diskgo purports that their portable hardrives are easy to use. My experience has been the exact opposite. The first one sent to me through buy.com didn't work at all. The second one only works about 50% of the time, which doesn't instill my confidence in it's ability to back up my files! The worst part about it is that their customer service is only available during the workday, so if you need help and you work, you're out of luck. I recommend buying a portable hard drive from another brand.When it works, it does back up files quickly, but it's doesn't make up for all the time I use trying to get it to work at all."
3,"Interesting details, rare actual video.","This was a interesting tape, displaying rare video of Tibet.It had some interesting information, though it is only 30 minutes long.Detailing Tibetan culture and Tibetan Buddhism.This is not really a Buddhist relegion tape though."
3,"speakers are great, but amp is so-so","The amp is well built, and is heavy. I was expecting something much better from this amp. However this amp does not produce the quality source to fully display the beauty of JBL speakers. I just changed the amp with $50 sonic t-amp, the sound is much cleaner and dynamic.Maybe, as the advertisement says, this is the system for commercial use. So functionablity is first concern of this system. The amp does come with many functions, like the use of mic, and the connection to phoneline. However, I have no way nor interests to try them.I purchase this system less than $100, so those two jbl speakers are already worth this price.In addition, the jbl control 1 coming with this set is 8 ohm, which is something I prefer to 4 ohm. (The indivindual sale control 1 is 4 ohm)Buy accordingly."
5,Liberators: wide and intelligent reading,"I have been a professor of Latin American history for nearly twenty years, and I have never before encountered a more thought-provoking and in-depth discussion of Latin America's quest for independence. Robert Harvey will no doubt enter into the realm of critical acclaim the world over. Stunning!"
4,A condemned murderer tells all,"While awaiting the electric chair, Donald ""Pee Wee"" Gaskins reflects on his life of murder and depravity. Gaskins offers no excuses and holds nothing back, and I've never been so horrified by a killer's story. Extremely disturbing, yet I couldn't put it down. A masterful insight into a diseased mind."
2,This book has haunted me....,"As a nurse and an avid reader of true crime, I thought I had seen or read it all. I hadn't. As another reviewer here said, this book will stay with you. I read this book years ago, but have never forgotten it. I was so sickened by it, I wanted to stop reading it and throw it out, but I couldn't. I had to read every last word. How does that quote go? ""...and when you look into the abyss, the abyss also looks into you...""? That's an accurate description of how this book affected me.The horrible atrocities perpetrated by the monster who wrote this book were described with relish, wistfulness, and total diregard for humanity.There is true evil in this world and this killer is the epitome of evil.I can only hope that there is a special room in Hell, just for him."
1,The gospel of victimology,"This autobiography by serial killer Pee Wee Gaskins is brought to you by the apparently easily-duped co-author, journalist Wilton Earle. Gaskins' justifications and distortions are passed along with little examination or challenge, and probably bear small resemblance to the facts."
5,A Tribute To Pee Wee Gaskins,"The book Final Truth was very intresting. Since i live in the area of which thies murders took place, i could picture where exactly he was at when he was describing his life. I realize how Donald had such a past. He grew up wrong. He was a good man, im sure. i was too young to know all about his murders, but he is a very intresting person. The way he did the things he did. I know it would be bad to say, but still after all, i respect him. If i was ever to be murdered, my murderer i would want to be pee wee. I feel like he is a famous rock star or something and im a huge fan. but hey, there are sick people in this world. If you have anything to mention to me. e-mail me anytime darkness328@aol.com This goes out to Donald Henry""Pee Wee"" Gaskins jr. We shal meet some day"
5,a disturbing view,"this book is a disturbing look into the mind of a truly sick individual.sometimes its hard to take in the information pee wee chooses to share,and you never know what to believe.because he was such a sick person ,you never know if hes gloating or being truthful.either way this is a must read if you are interested in true crime and serial killer's confessions."
3,Related to Victim,"If I were not related to Doreen Dempsey (she's my half-sister) I would probably give this book a 5 star because of the descriptive content and the brazenness of Gaskins. My stomach turned when I read in detail what he did to her and her child. I had previously read articles about the murder which weren't so graphic. Doreen previously lived in Reading and was adopted out (as was I) although I went to a stable family in Philadelphia. She stayed with a ""carney"" family. As you read this book, say a prayer for all his victims. and he deserved what he got - electrocution. I'm sure he's in the deepest bowels of Hell."
3,An Unpleasant Trip Into A Sick and Psychotic Mind,"I knew going into this book that I would be highly disturbed byits content. It is certainly not one that I would recommend forreading pleasure or inspiration. It is a horrible book about asick and psychotic serial killer. I find it devestating to knowthere was someone who walked this earth as evil, vile, and disturbing as Pee Wee Gaskins. This book should be read by onlythe hardcore true crime reader. For an inspirational and uplifting book, I would suggest reading Billy Hills and Dale Hudson's A Reason To Live: The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination To Survive. This is the kind of story you will read and be satisfied that justice pervailed and thatthe good guys won in the end."
3,Shockingly bad or good?,"I gave this book three stars because on the one hand I hated it yet on the other hand I couldn't stop reading it. On the bad side was author himself (Gaskins), how horrifying and depraved his attitudes and actions; on the good side it was very engrossing and the autobiography style was really effective at conveying the killer's perceptions and personality. It's hard to believe that such pure evil exists in any person; Gaskins is like a man who is completely deficient and devoid in the area of empathy and compassion. The man is truly abnormal, yet terrifyingly capable of a superficially ""normal"" presentation. A good example of the psychopath (NOT the psychotic) in his terrifying blankness of humanity."
5,Excellent,"I bought and read this book in the same day. For anyone interested in Forensic Psychology, or like me, just loves this kind of reading .. It is a must. Definately worth any amount you have to pay for it."
5,Well written,"I did not know Pee Wee personally, however, at the time I was closely associated with the area and especially the bait and tackle shop on Rivers Ave. in North Charleston where Pee Wee hung out. One of the young boys that he killed used to come to this tackle shop. In North Charleston the bait and tackle shop was a front for regular bars . Most of the descriptions conveyed in the book were very close to the local news and community talk at the time. The scenes described in the book potray the sickness that was in this man and as he stated in the book there are hundreds out there just as sick as he was."
1,Final Truth is Mostly Lies,"I've studied Pee Wee Gaskins extensively and interviewed his family, former teachers, neighbors, law enforcement, prosecutors, etc. Pee Wee was never beaten and abused as a child -- quite the opposite. As a handsome and intelligent little boy, he was the darling of his family and was pampered. His family members were hardworking, decent, church-going people, who were as shocked as everyone when it became clear that he was a psychopath -- killing birds and frogs at the age of 5.He was an incredible liar and used this autobiography to enhance his legend in the Florence County area of South Carolina. When one tries to verify the details in the Final Truth, starting with basics like his mother's age when he was born, one realizes how fictional most of Gaskins' account is.The story of Pee Wee is fascinating, but you won't learn it from this book."
5,Final truth,I was recommended this book by a friend who lives in SC and I must say it is excellent. I thought the idea of having Gaskins himself as narrator was excellent. I'd recommend this book to anyone who can stomach it!
4,"Strange smell, tiny sampler",I have smelled these before but the samplers that I received smells a little diffrently. Sampler is really tiny too and not worth for the price. I gave 4 because of the fast shipping.
1,Warning warning warning,"CAM have released several versions of this soundtrack, bungling the job each time. The album listed here comprises one track of another Vangelis scored film (known as ""Ignacio"" or ""Entends-tu Les Chiens Aboyer"") and one track of the ""La Fete Sauvage"" soundtrack.To find out how to identify a version that actually has the proper ""La Fete Sauvage"" soundtrack, go to the Vangelis Elsewhere site: ..."
3,A dissapointing CD-reissue mistake,"I own the original LP (vynil) album, and I like most of it. Side 1 of the LP begins with a short and very lively instrumental tune that joins electronics with african drums. After this tune finishes, a series of african chants, drums and lion roars are introduced and lasts 10 minutes or so, being the low point of the album. Side 2 of the LP is full of beatiful melodies, with hints of ""L'apocalypse des animaux"" and ""Opera Sauvage"", being the high point of the album.Unfortunately, on the CD album the side 2 of the LP album is joined with the side 2 of the ""Ignacio"" album, which I also own as both LP and CD, therefore omitting the side 1 of the original ""Fete sauvage"" LP. Although some of the deleted music is the low point of the album, as I mentioned earlier, I miss the introductory tune very much, and I would have preferred to have the complete ""Fete Sauvage"" instead of having half of it and having twice the second half of ""Ignacio""!"
5,The Father of American Dressage,"This book is a must-have for the serious dressage trainer, rider, enthusiast. From building respect through ground work, behavior modification through reward and repetition, to lightness and harmony from training level to Grand Prix and haute ecole, Chuck teaches that dressage is good for all horses (and people, really), regardless of their breeding or their discipline."
5,great music,"I first heard this about 5o years ago..1959..I was going through jump school at Ft Bragg,N.C. when I heard this coming out of a seargeant'sI first heard this in 1959 while going through jump school at Ft.Bragg,N.C. I was so impressed,I knocked on a sergeant's door to ask what it was...He invited me in..explained who it was and and I have been a fan ever since...This is treasure..has been unavailable for years and I stumbled upon it on Amazon by accident..I ordered 2 copies, one for a friend who I turned on over 25 years ago....It has been in my truck CD player for the past three weeks and I never seem to tire of it...enjoy!!!"
5,So Nice,Poinciana [Live] is wonderful. I love hearing the dishes clanking in the background in some of the songs. I imagine being amongst the crowd listening.
5,What happens when cheesehead farmers retire?,"What happens when cheesehead farmers retire? They go nutty and start making incredible environments. The landscape of Wisconsin is festooned with all sorts of wondrous creations - some big, some small. I have personally used this book as a self tour of many of the spaces described in the book. The authors have painstakingly documented a host of art creations of energetic Wisconsonians. An amazing array of obsessive-compulsive art making awaits you. You will NOT be disappointed! This book is a RARE find. Buy it. Use it. Then go out there and make something yourself!"
3,Dated but excellent,"This book is excellent if you but remember that it is a period piece in itself. Written in the very early 1900's by an author who was clearly rather shocked by the things his research revealed and obviously not Catholic himself,nevertheless it is well worth reading and I often found myself chuckling at his quietly outraged tone. It simply goes to show that the Catholic Church has been rife with corruption from the very top from its inception forward. And it points out the very ridiculousness of trying to enforce the unnatural practice of celibacy on human beings, who simply were not designed for it."
1,Only Thing Interesting is the Title!,"Of the 330 pages in this book, about fifty of them are interesting. The book was written in 1912 and this is a reprint of that original publication. Despite his disclaimers, the author definitely has an ax to grind. It doesn't seem so much to be one he wields to disparage, as it does one wielded by someone on the outside looking in, who is green with envy. The antiquated writing style of this author is pretty boring. He goes on with endless lists of names of papabili and the women they allegedly recruited as patronesses. It's hard to tell which ones are men and which are women, and that really confuses some of his tales. When the author zeros in on a couple of major pope makers, like Mathilda of Tuscany or Donna Olimpia, it gets a little interesting. As a period piece, it is a good one, but it just doesn't work beyond that. Use the handy dandy index to look up Mathilda and Donna and you will get those good fifty pages I mentioned."
2,too much money for this,It worked good for a month or so then it was loosing signal a few times a week and needing reset. now it dont work at all. for that kind of money it should work longer than that. Ive tried all kinds of batteries.
1,"Great Idea, but doen't work well","I purchased the unit several years ago and the receiver (the unit with the pressure display) always seems to lose connection to the transmitter. Every place I put it, it initially acquires the signal and displays the pressure for a short while. It then abrupty loses connection and I need to take the batteries out and wait. I check the pressure in my lp tank this way once a week, a pain but better than climbing over snow in the Adirondack winter to get to my tank."
2,RS-228 Not for cold winter use,"We have two tanks and two of the RS-228 sensors. They worked very well for 3 seasons, but here in Mid-Michigan they are non-working for the Winter months, below 32. Sensors fail in cold, even though the receiver & sender are in a straight line, 40' & thru a window, sensors are inaccurate and then totally stop working. The phone/secretary in Texas said that they can be erratic in cold weather, which is why we purchased them. Very unhappy, no replies from company via eMail or regular mail, phone messages never returned by RCC customer service. Local dealer stopped selling & installing for above reasons."
1,This thing doesn't work,Very simple. Don't buy it. You'll find other reviews on the net that verify that it just doesn't work. Still looking for one that does.
2,Unreliable,"Like the others, I've had trouble with the unit maintaining a connection. The first one worked for 4 months fine then, for whatever reason, it would not reestablish a connection when I reset it. The second one (replaced for free by my gas company) loses the connection every time a storm comes through. In my humble opinion, this was a waste of my money."
3,"Lots of Eye Candy, But Weird and Off-Putting","There is a lot to like here for us guys, beautiful Bollywood eye-candy and slapstick humor. However, this film feels strange and off-putting. It is morally corrupt in a specifically Bollywood way.Marriage is so sacred in the land of Bollywood and yet here is a film that relishes in its infidelity. It reminds me of American exploitation films of the 1970s. The film glories in the forbidden fruits, but must conform in plot to the moral rules of the modern India. That makes for a film that isn't nearly as much fun at it wants to be.For an American audience (not NRI), this movie will seem quite strange, even if you are used to the amusing excesses of Bollywood Cinema. You won't regret watching it, but by the end you'll feel like you've been watching a 'fetish film' for a fetish you don't undestand."
5,great indie movie,"i wasnt sure what to expect when i saw this movie, but i was impressed with the level of realism this movie displayed. i think its hard to portray the art of graffiti in a positive manner, and even harder to build an entertaining and stimulating storyline around it. this movie surpassed my expectations on all accounts, and i would highly recommend it to anyone remotely interested in the graffiti culture."
4,Pretty good turntable,"I got this to replace my 30 year old Technics SL Q2. The first one I received had the corner of the dust cover crushed. I got an RMA, returned it and reordered. The second turntable was intact. I've been using it for a couple weeks now and have no complaints. The sound quality is good, speed seems right on. The cartridge which is included calls for pretty heavy tracking forces. I'll replace it with a Shure M97xE as I'm a little concrened about the effect of heavy tracking on my older albums.All in all a good purchase."
5,5 Years Strong,"I just happened to be looking on Amazon at turntables, while listening to my AT-PL120 and I can attest to its quality and durability for home use. It plays 33 1/3 equally as well as 45 (does 78 too, but who has 78s??) in forward and reverse. Nice to also have the all possible adjustments available (a force gauge is a must). The target light comes in handy. If you are a home user like me or a professional DJ, I don't see how you can go wrong with this direct drive turntable. You almost get a high-end Technics turntable for a fraction of the price!"
5,A Fine Turntable,"I replaced a rather primitive turntable with this one. It is possibly the best turntable I have owned, but I am not an audiophile and so cannot comment on its comparison with other, perhaps, more expensive tables.The instructions for putting it together and using it are clear and precise. It handles 33, 45 and 78 records which was important to me as I own some golden oldies and was converting them to digital and burning CDs with Nero (good for files and CDs) and PC Clean (good for files, records, CDs and cassettes).It can be used with or without a pre-amp. I have a low budget multi-selector pre-amp and the sound thru the turntable connection had a hum, so I reconnected thru the cassette connection and set the turntable to internal pre-amp and all was well. It's also good looking.I am very pleased with this turntable and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want a changer."
2,Nasty Surprises,I've had the AT-PL120 turntable for about a month. It worked relatively well with the included cartrdge. There was some minor hum but it was only noticable with my receiver's volume up very loud with no record playing. I tried installing a Sure M78S cartridge for playing 78 rpm records and the problems started. There was noticable hum even when playing records. I also installed an Audio-Technica AT440MLa Cartridge. This cartridge gets very good reviews from audio weenies. The hum was outrageous from the second I turned the thing on. The cartridge works fine in my brother's old Kenwood direct-drive unit. I tried using the turntable with the internal preamp and with the one in my receiver as well as connecting directly to my Mac for CD burning. The problem persists. The unit will be going back tomorrow. Very Disappointing.
2,Warped platter caused constant skipping,"This is my first experience with a turntable, and while this instilled the addiction, it wasn't worth keeping. After putting everything together, following the directions as close as possible, I spun the platter around for fun. I noticed a significant wobble to it, looking along the top and not just at the rim where the dots are. I put an old record on, and the needle immediatly bounced off the record. Tried removing and cleaning the seating hole and spindle and carefully re-seating the platter, with no improvement. Finally got fed up and I am sending it back today."
4,Good buy!,"If anyone is looking for an inexpensive turntable that performs quite well, buy the Audio-Technica AT-PL120 turntable. With the built-in phono pre-amp the turntable is quite versatile. So if your preamp or receiver has no phono input, you can plug it into any AUX input. There are many used records on the market for as little as a dollar or so(as well as new ones still being produced). This turntable coupled to an integrated amp makes an affordable package. Get some good monitor speakers and you will have a fine music system. Check out the small speakers from such companies as PSB, Polk, and Monitor Audio. Find a used integrated amp from NAD or Cambridge Audio (or buy a new one for around $350). For less than $1,000 you will have a music system that will be satisfying for quite a while. I love the turntable."
5,Dan,I like the turntable very much. Two thumbs up to Amazon.com for the smooth buying and delivery process. I would be willing to buy from them again.
5,great,"This turntable is well worth the extra $100 or so over the $100 players. I plays amazingly, is easy to set up and install, and has great sound quality, along with some great features."
4,Turntable Audio-Technica At-Pl-120,Sounds good and fun to use. First new turntable in couple decades. My Garrard was fully automatic. So still getting use to Starting Stopping and changing records.Most of my records were played few times then taped. Think I'll be listening to the records again.
5,Audio-Technica AT-PL120,I am very satisfied with this unit. I think it is a great deal for the price. Operates forward and reverse. The pitch can be varied. To me the most important feature is the internal amplifier so that this unit can operate with any modern amp.
3,Solid TT,"The sound is clean and ""lean and mean"", but not excessively so (using Benz Micro Silver now). Rhythm and pace is not like my Thorens 125, but it's easy to use and perfect for a second TT. I am using the Thorens less now!For audiophiles the big trouble of this TT is its VTA. You have to put at least 2 thick LPs on the platter to bring the VTA to even thinkable range. Even then, the VTA is off. I guess this is really meant for the DJ (the prototype Technics 1200 is the same)."
4,Very well made turntable,"Solid, well made turntable. Except for the pickup arm plastic holddown. That broke the first day. I have also had a hard time getting rid of the 60hz hum completely. This turntable does not have a ground wire like my last one did. But overall this is a very good well thought out product. Auto return arm feature is a big feature left out though."
5,Old School Music - New School Technology,"I love being able to listen to my old albums and 45s again. If you're the average Joe wanting to convert your old music - be aware that it does NOT come with software or proper wires to hook up to computer for digital format conversion. Expect to pay to buy both if you want to burn albums to CD. I bought Windows Plus software to convert analog albums to digital format for CDs. I also bought an adapter to convert red/white output plug to one stereo jack to plug into computer's in-line.Turntable is of nice, solid construction and sounds great."
5,Quality through and through,"The other reviews given are spot on. This is a top quality unit, especially in this price range. And it passes my most critical quality test. When I first operate complex equipment, I always refer to the user manual, if supplied. You can tell a lot about a company's attitude toward its customers by the effort they put into this piece of paper (or booklet, if you're lucky).Despite being a Japanese company, Audio-Technica actually hired a native speaker of English to write the 12-page booklet. I couldn't find a single error in grammar, spelling or punctuation. How refreshing in a world where most such documents are apparently written and translated by idiots or, worse, by computer software and never checked by a speaker of English. And, best of all, it's written ONLY in English, instead of the usual paper-wasting four languages.Thank you, A-T, for a fine product and a quality user manual!"
5,Treat Your Ears!,"The AT PL120 is a the best ""bang for the buck"" for a mid-priced good sounding home use table I've come across yet. It has DJ features like reverse, stylus light, up to 20% pitch adjustment etc-but it's not really a DJ table. I would characterize this machine as a good home system unit suitable for the non ""audiophile"" who nevertheless appreciates good sounding vinyl. The supplied cartridge sees to that quite well. It really sounds good on a variety of music. The tables DJ features are just uneeded ""extras"" in my opinion. The important stuff is the direct drive motor which is powerful with lots of torque. The quartz lock control is dead on-what you really need. All in all this is a good sounding good value no fuss home unit. If you're really a DJ get a Technics 1200 instead-don't waste your time with the AT PL120. However, if your reading this I'll bet your not a DJ but just enjoy listening to vinyl-if so go for it! You can't go wrong with this one!"
5,Terrific Transcription Turntable,"As an ""old dawg"" I have a large vinyl record collection. Mostly 33 rpm but some very old 78's as well. Many of these records have not and probably will never be re-released as CD's or other digital media. I purchased the Audio-Technica AT-PL120 Professional Direct-Drive Turntable specifically to transcribe the analog records to digital. This turntable was easy to set up and easy to use and works perfectly with my computers sound card without a separate pre-amp. There may be less expensive turntables but none better suited for this use."
3,audio-technica AT-PL120 direct drive turntable review,"The turntable works well, looks great, and it has been great to listen to the old LPs again.My main objection to the turntable is the lack of an auto return feature. So, when the record is done, the needle just keeps on groovin' until you lift the lever and return the arm. This means having to baby-sit the turntable while it is playing to avoid having to buy a new needle every month. The auto-return feature should be standard and I wont buy another turntable without it."
1,save ur money and get a technic 1200 mk2,"i bought this to think i could pass for a technic 1200 i was wrong, i own a technic 1200 mk2 and this pile of junk does not even mach the standard with a 1200 mk2.save ur money and get a 1200 or a numark ttx and u will be happy."
4,Audio Technica AT-PL120,"I have had this product for about a month. I was looking for a turntable to play the hundreds of records that I have collected over the years, and abandoned when I went ""digital"".The Audio Technica is not a ""high end"" turntable so I can't say it has the ultimate fidelity that can be achieved by much more expensive systems, but it is a fantastic value, very well built, and easy to use, with great sound. The sounds is superior to cd's by a wide margine in my estimation.It has some ""disco"" type features that I dont use."
5,Nice turntable,This turntable is a nice addition to my system. It is easy to use and the instructions were clear and easy to understand. I would recommend this piece of equipment to anyone with records they love to play. I am very satisfied with the product.
4,Nice equipment,"The turntable arrived well packaged. Assembly and hook up were straightforward and took a short amount of time. It's easy to operate, my kids can do it. I'm pleased with it so far and have enjoyed dusting off old vinyl."
3,An Ok turntable,"Audio-Technica AT-PL120 Professional Direct-Drive TurntableThis turntable looks nice, seems nice, but it was hard to get to work and after a few months the stylus starts skidding across the disks. I modified the anti skating to 2.5 and 3.5 but it still did it. Then reading other reviews I found that shanging the cartridge may resolve the problem. I did and bought a Shure 97E and it now works Ok. However, the ""humm"" that some reviewers comment is also present in my case. I have not been able to get rid of it yet. For the price, I would not buy it again and I would not recommend it."
3,Excellent Value for the Price!,"I have been using this turntable for about a week now and so far so good.It replaced a 28 year old Thorens that finally gave out. I decided to go with a Direct Drive this time due to the reduced number of parts. For the price it appears to be very good. It is not a Technics, but it also doesn't cost $500 - $600. It is certainly better than those $100 pieces of junk that most retailers try to sell you now. My only complaint so far is that it doesn't at least lift the arm when the record is done, but I knew that when I bought it so I decided to live with it. If it wasn't for that I would be completely satisfied. I have not experienced any hum issues and the sound with the included cartridge is actually quite good. It has a nice solid, well constructed feel to it. I don't know if it will last 28 years but all things considered, I would definitely recommend it."
5,Impressed,"I have been totally impressed with this turntable. So much so, that I bought two of them. I bought the first one for my stereo system. It is a great turntable for the money, most direct drives cost much more. After checking out the first one, I bought a second one to use with my computer to transfer some old LP's to CD's. It is working great also. This turntable does take a little while to set up, especially the first time. I think it was worth the work."
3,Not up to par,"I ordered the PL120 and I am surprised at the design flaws it has. For one thing the cables are the shortest length I have ever seen in a commercial turnatable(less than three feet). It has no rubber mat. It has a fabric slip mat, but that is supposed to sit on the bare aluminum platter. The motor has a plenty of torque and it seems to run quite steady. The tracking force adjustment is very touchy - it comes out of adjustment sometimes . The anti-skating does not seem to have much effect. The cueing has a height adjustment, but it is quite jumpy as well. This is not acceptable in an 'Audiophile' machine - much less a 'DJ Grade' turntable. The cartridge that comes with it is not high-end , but it is acceptable. It does look sharp though."
5,Very Nice Turntable,"I bought this turntable for my dad so he could listen to his records. It was easy to set up and worked very well. Glad I got this one and not one of the cheaper Sony's or the USB turntables. It has all speeds 45, 33 1/3, and 78. The ability to easily change cartriges is there. It hooked up to his recevier easily, and has the built in pre amp so I didn't have to buy and hook up a external one. This turntable sounds great, has well built constrution, and has most if not all of the extras you need. (Strobe, tracking, weight adjustment, pitch control). I listened to several records and I thought it sounded great, you get such a rich full sound from vinyl. If you want a good turntable for a great price I think this one is the way to go."
5,WAY BACK IN HIGH-SCHOOL,WAY BACK IN HIGH-SCHOOL COLUMBUS WAS STUPID OVER BONE.I PERSONALLY SAW 26 PEOPLE SHOOT THEIR CHILDREN WHENTHUGGISH-RUGGISH BONE CAME ON THE RADIO.
1,bone sucks!,who ever said bone is the greatest rap group of all time is dead wrong. this c.d. like all their others is awful. they are nothing compared to groups like A TRIBE CALLED QUEST and my favirotes MOBB DEEP. I wold suggest passing up on this eight tracks of (bull) rap you can't even understand.
3,3 Stars,"Creepin' On Ah Come Up is my favorite Bone Thugs-N-Harmony album because it was the first. It was groundbreaking hip hop for its time, but overall it is an AVERAGE album."
4,The first bone thugs album,"This is the first bone thugs release and what can I say; its excellent rap music and a good intro to the BTNH world. Probably every track on this CD is worth listening to. The best ones, in my opinion, are ""thuggish ruggish bone"" and ""no surrender."" In comparison to the other BTNH records, I'd say that while it isn't the best thing they put out, its at least worth listening to, if not for the music, then at least for the fact that this is where they started out, coming out with this record in 1994."
4,A Perfect Start,"This album could've done without numbers 1 and 2 because 1's an intro and 2 is...i dunno wut it is, its just not good. With the exception of those two, there are 6 great songs. check out thuggish ruggish bone, no surrender, down foe my thang and for tha love of $"
4,Bang Bang Gotta Get Down Foe My Thang,"Creepin on ah Come Up gives you just a taste of what's to come. Bone is one of the best groups out there basically cuz they revolutionized the game. On this cd you get a chance to expierience some of thier style but not all of it. It features such great tracks as ""Thuggish Ruggish Bone"" ""Down Foe My Thang"" and the hard hittin ""No Surrender"". Every Bone fan must have this cd in thier collection."
4,str8 coo album ta have,"This one takes it home not like east1999 it's more layback this is da tipe of album that cha lisen 2 at the quib u know whut I'am saying tha hipe joints on it is like no serender,thuggish ruggish bone but outha then that this is like in album ya kick at da path n light a fatty 2 you know wut I'am sayen ""piece God bless yall""."
3,still remember when it came out,"These dudes were different than anything else when they came out in 1994. The production sounded like what had become popular the last couple of years but the vocals were crazy. And having EAZY E in their corner helped skeptical hip hoppers give em a chance. But, only 7 tracks."
4,GREAT INTRODUCTION,"THIS IS A GREAT INTRODUCTION FOR ONE OF IF NOT THE BEST GROUP OF ALL TIME. THIS IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR WITH DIVERSE LYRICAL FLOWS AND HARD HEATING BEATS. ALTHOUGH SHORT THE ALUMS HAS GREAT SONGS OF STORY TELLING SUCH AS 'FOE THE LUV OF MONEY"", THUGGISH RUGGISH BONE"", ""NO SURRENDER"" AND OTHERS. THIS ALBUM TO SOME WOULD SEEM JUST AS A PRE-FILLER TO THEIR CLASSIC ALBUM E.1999 ETERNAL BUT THIS IS WORTH THE PURCHASE."
5,Meditation book,"I love this book. I bought it for myself because I had one from the same author, Fr. Fulton Sheen. But a friend at work was going through some rough times so I gave it to her and she said it has been very helpful. She isn't Catholic and still benefits from it very much."
2,Not soundtrack music!,"I love the music of Ron Goodwin, particularly ""Battle of Britain"" and ""633 Squadron"". Beware, though, that this is not cut from his soundtrack recordings. This is the BBC Philharmonic (i.e. small-time studio orchestra)and directed by some mysterious unknown conductor named Rumon Gamba. Some of the music is chopped up and poorly edited. The entire beginning of ""633 Squadron"" is cut out and the music starts probably 10 seconds or so from what should be the beginning. ""Battle of Britain"" is done as a medley of sorts and the individual segments are thrown together with no rhyme or reason.Forget this CD and spend a little more on the original soundtracks."
3,Enjoyable!,"Ron Goodwin is a fine composer. I particularly enjoyed listening to the music from the early 1960's Miss Marple films, starring Margaret Rutherford. But, to let one know; the Marple music is different from most of the Goodwin scores on this CD. His music is mostly of the rousing march or military variety."
3,An overlooked film composer,"This is a definitive starter collection representing the career of an often overlooked film composer. Particularly noteworthy are the selections from 633 SQUADRON, THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN, and the magnificent main title theme that accompanies the ""postcard from London"" opening to Hitchcock's FRENZY."
3,Questionable crushings,"3 1/2Even on compositional overkill mode this trio usually ends up swallowing everything in its path, letting the listener enjoy a residual musical burp."
4,Ignore the hype,"This is a pretty darn good CD. Maybe not great, but good. Ignore the hype, put your expectations aside and listen. For those who don't think this sounds like jazz, well maybe it doesn't. This group is more about ensemble interaction than soloes, of which there are none on this disk. I came in late to a show the other night, and ended up at a table with a seat that was on the edge of the stage, practically in the middle of the group. My neck got sore from turning from the drums to the bass to the piano and back. The playing was very tight.I would say that I was surprised by how reserved this disk is. The live playing is much more raucous and adventurous. And that is the main reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars."
2,Bad (and that ain't good),"I have the first two Bad Plus CDs and when I burned my own ""best of"" compilation it didn't come close to filling the available 80 minutes. As a jazz fan I've never been able to take Bad Plus seriously either in a traditional sense or as a post-modern experiment but I found them a good, somewhat edgy listening alternative when the mood struck. And they win the prize for clever song titles. But, while, all the technical skills are there, the net result on Suspicious Activity is a king of loud boredom. When I finally got to track 6 (Lost of Love)I sensed that they may pull the recording out of the doldrums but about 4 minutes in it just became an over-dramatic muddle. That's what this is - a muddle followed by post-muddle. That said, it wouldn't surprise me if these guys someday turn out a minor masterpiece given the amount of talent lost in here."
5,A Joy,"I have listened to the album about 5 times all the way through and as with thier other albums it just keeps growing on me. It is decidedly less rocky and it has a more, for lack of a better word, serious feel to it. It is a nice clean recording and has lots of gems for those of us with Audiophile equipment. This album, like the others, will permanently reside in my heavy music rotation.Other people have mentioned it, but these guys are absolutely spot on when they perform live. I have seen them twice, the most recent being a full two hour set @UPenn which was amazing from my 3rd row seat. I found it hard to keep a grin off my face because I knew that I was witnessing something very special."
2,Fault with Colombia corp. copy policy,"This is a fine work of art.Then, why 2 stars for this product? The record label limits the means by which you can copy this cd. I don't want to make real player files or windows media files tracks from this cd. I want to create simple mp3s but I suppose those are too easily shared using P2P applications. Well, let me tell you, I DONT CARE what the company wants. I care what I want. For the future I will always avoid buying CDs in this format. Educate yourself before you buy. I can't even choose my bit-rate with this junk."
1,Sloppy jazz and copy protected,"Stupid album from trendy jazz wannabees. Copy protection software not only denies your right to rip to your iPod, but it has spyware that will kill your computer. Suspicious activity, indeed."
2,Three Good Qualities,"Having watched this film again, I am holding to the same conclusion. Three areas help keep this film's head above water.One, three of its actors, namely Anthony Hopkins, Val Kilmer, and Angelina Jolie. Without their skills of expressing wide-ranges of subtle and profound emotions, the dialogue would have come across as being flat.Two, the large scale battle scenes and sets are very elaborate, breath-taking and do not overwhelm the viewer.And three, the costumes also are well above standard from what I expected.However, the storyline leaves a lot to be desired, felt more like fiction than any historical record, and can be summed up easily in one sentence...An immoral man subjugates many lands and, like other ancient and modern conquerors, does not reach old age while keeping his immorality intact."
2,Skipped a scene (Online streaming),"The movie isn't bad, but it's not great either. The biggest issue I had was that around the 1hr mark, there was a scene that was completely skipped. I tried rewinding and got the same result. I waited until the following day and still got the same result. Not sure why it happened, but the scene appears to be missing (Drunken father falls after wedding). The movie picks up right at the end of that scene."
3,Better in Theaters,I liked the original theatrical cut better than this version or the first directors cut.
3,Good,"Alexander the Great was a man who was so complicated we're still discussing him and his achievements years after his death. Unfortunately we've yet to find a movie that can match his greatness.This movie tries, and in some measures it does succeed, like in the sets, costumes and some battle scenes, but the dialogue is sometimes a bit silly and sometimes the best dialogue went to supporting characters and not the main ones. I would never have cast Colon Farrell as Alexander. He tried, I think, but couldn't pull off what was needed to bring him to life. I prefered to watch Gary Stretch as Cleitus or Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Cassander before Colin. They weren't even that overly important to the story.I understood the reason for the accents, but for some, they just couldn't pull them off. Angelina's was the main one I wish they would have left American.It's an OK film. I just hope they'll make a film that'll rival his greatness soon."
1,Crap.,"They have Scottish accents through the first half of the movie. A ton of historical inaccuracies, like characters quoting Virgil who wasn't alive for another 200 years. Poor acting. Just an overall bad movie."
2,Weak sauce,"Decent movie. I was turned off by the fact that all the guys have eye shadow. Simply stupid...but otherwise it has some of the biggest most epic battles of any movie.Cons: Its a BD.....yet it doesnt fit on one disc!? Hmmm maybe it doesnt fit because its really high quality AV....WRONG!!! Terrible VC-1 video with...you guessed it....NO HD AUDIO AT ALL!!!!!!! Just regular DVD quality Dobly 5.1........not even DTS.....no TrueHD, no PCM, no Master audio..nothing. Horrible. SHAME ON YOU!!!!Also Angelina's accent was terrible. Not at her best by far"
1,All that needs to be said,"I remember when this movie came out, I was a Junior in High School. A few of my buddies and I decided to ditch the remainder of the day after the first two periods, so we went to the movies to see Alexander. We ended up walking out of after about 75 minutes and decided to GO BACK TO SCHOOL. It was that bad. I have not seen a movie since that would even come close to inspiring such a reaction. That pretty much says it all in my opinion. I hadn't thought about that event in years until I found myself at a buddy's house the other day, scanning his hard drive for a movie to watch. We had concluded that we wanted to watch some ""ancient adventure movie,"" and it didn't really matter what it was as long as it had ""spear battles and stuff"" a la Gladiator. So I saw Alexander on there and, after telling that story, decided to give it a shot to see if it's still that bad. I assure you it is."
2,top o the mornin ta ya alexander,"stones cool but i just cant get past all the accents real and contrived IT IS ALL OVER THE PLACE. can we stick to one american or gag british accent since know one speaks ancient greek and everyone can do american? God british/irish accents added to classical greek or roman military pieces really tick me off. mate, ceaser's wanting to have a little hows yo mom. Like watching King Arthur with an indian accent just so wrong"
1,Matthew Edmundson there's just one problem,"When first hearing there was going to a movie released that was going to cover the life of ""the Great"" I must admit I was enthused. After reading about how Stone would be covering this, who would be playing in it (Val Kilmer and Colin Farrell two of the worst actors in history), and saw the screens for the way they were being dressed (Colin's armor-ridiculous, and although I shall not lie I didn't mind seeing it: Angelina Jolie's toga was just a tad tight, on purpose perhaps? You tell me Stone). Anyway, I knew at once that I would NOT be catching this flick, therefore, Matthew Edmundson you are absolutely correct, except you paid money to see this terrible film."
2,What was I thinking?,"Now I remember why I had the faint feeling that this was a horrible movie. I vaguely remember that it was a mess and figured a directors cut might fix it(like Kingdom of Heaven), then as I watched it I realized that if the director is horrible a directors cut wouldn't do much.He just made it longer, not better. Wow, do I hate this movie, waste of time and money."
2,"Bad acting, script, music, sets, lighting","So disappointing. I wanted to love this, and instead am embarrassed for Oliver Stone, and anyone who participated in this film. The acting is abysmal, and the writing even worse. Overacted, over-written, schlock. The score is dreadful, and the costumes and sets look amateurish. Check this out at the library and see for yourself before you buy this nonsense. A waste."
2,not very thrilling,"Let me sum this up for you in simple terms and fairly quickly. this is not Braveheart. Its not ""300"" Its not even Troy. heck the 13th warrior was a true masterpiece by comparison.. for the record i liked the 13th warrior. This movie plugs along with big name actors and a big budget and no direction in my opinion.. i dont care if its historicaly correct or not. Im not watching the history channel im watching a movie and want to be entertained. This movie fails to do that. Its not the worst thing ive ever seen but its far from the best.. save yourself the heartache and just re-watch braveheart and be happy."
3,SKANDER,"AS A HISTORY EPIC LOVER, I LIKE THIS MOVIE.ALSO I AM INTERESTED IN THE LIFE STORY OF ALEXANDER.BUT THIS CUT IS NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST CUT.I HAD EXPECTED MORE THAN THIS.YET THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE TO SHOW US THE PRIVATE AND POLITICAL LIFE OF ALEXANDER (IN THE EASTERN WORLD WE CALL HIM ""SKANDER"")."
1,This is not a history movie!,"Oh my god I can't believe my friend was dumb enough to say this movie was great. I went to see it and to me it's not. The fighting scenes were horrible and it also felt like I was watching a spin off from The Last Sumuari, Troy, Patriot, and Braveheart. Alexander was not greek! I mean this movie is just a bunch of [...]. It actually shows Alexander kissing a guy and a woman and it looks like he's [...]. I was sittin down for three hours waiting to go home and if you are smart please do not go see this movie you won't believe it at all. The Alexander books are good but not the movie. The movie is full of crap."
1,Hideously boring,"This may be an interesting historical story, but, it needs to be condensed to about 20 min. No dramatic tension, pacing that would make Russian directors happy. Basically, a very long high school history class movie that, while perhaps historically acurate, makes you long for the buzzer."
4,A surprise delight,"Good video transfer, good audio tranfer, disappointed that the HD DVD has no true HD sound option, however, Dolby digital plus was good."
5,Finally the right cut!,I loved this movie from the first time I saw it. This final cut makes a saga out of the story and I just love it. Buy this one if you are going to get one.
1,queer eye for the so called greatest alexander,"I had high expectations for the movie. I was sadly let down. This is trash, pure & simple. Alex wasn't ""great""... he betrayed his own people, wanted to conquer the whole world due to his own relentless selfishness and was bi-sexual! The scene w/ him and boy george disgusted me, that dark amazon looking wench was gross too. don't waste your time or money on this filth...PASS!!"
1,"WARNING: Same disaster, only...it's longer!!","This so-called ""new"" version is nothing more than the original theatrical release...which TOTALLY bombed at the box office! People found it too dull, drab, boring & self-serving. The studio behind Alexander's release, in an attempt to try and salvage something, had Oliver Stone cut 40 minutes from the DVD release the first time around. Guess what? Didn't work! People still thought it sucked!Whether those 40 minutes are in there or not, Alexander is stiil the same total & utter failure that it is. Don't waste your money on this stuff, folks. There's better things to spend it on then a bastardization of history designed to get somebody their weekly yacht payment."
2,Alexander The Gay!,"It was making me nauseous, seeing so many men with eye makeup on! These guys were probably wearing pink thongs under their mini skirts too! I love this type of movie, but I just found this one to be uninteresting. Even most of the battle scenes weren't that great. (Three hours) of a movie that's not that good, is definitely way too long! It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's extremely far from great! Whoever decided to use Colin Farrell to play Alexander, should be shot! He looks ridiculous with blond hair too. See Gladiator or Troy instead, they're great!"
1,No star,"with all the big names and big money, (a lot of extras, fancy props and sets gone to waste) I was shocked at the terrible result. The movie was biased more towards making sure every one knew that homosexuality existed in the ranks than it was with portraying historical accuracy and detail. It was more a political statement enforcing the mass acceptance of this practice in the modern world. The fact is that there is no ancient document that clearly attests that this was the way of things (at least in the ""universal"" degree portrayed in this film), therefore to included it so heavily in this film is an attempt to bias history in an unwarranted fashion. Unprofessional and unsuccessful, a sad reflection of our times - demoralized and disintegrating into darkness."
1,Wow! Was this boring!,"Ok, I must admit I only made it through 120 minutes of the 160 minute run time. Maybe all the good stuff happens in the last 40 minutes, but I was bored out of my mind and couldn't take it anymore.I like the genre, this was just a painfully dull execution of it. Get Troy instead -- that was a solid movie. Good story, good action, keeps you interested the whole way through.Skip this."
2,"A nice historical interpretation, but little else...","This is a fanciful and somewhat interesting interpretation on the life of Alexander the Great, but as a film epic it is sorely lacking...especially in the screenplay and leading performances. Jolie, Farrell, Kilmer, Hopkins and Plummer are all wasted...buried under hair and makeup effects. Jared Leto seems to have fallen in from MTV. Alexander is more of a hysteric than a hero and this Director's Cut is particularly long and tough to endure without a few hits of the Pause button.The Director's Commentary track, however, is the most worthwhile thing about this...for hearing Oliver Stone's own opinion, thoughs and defense of his title character is a bit like attending a university lecture by a professor who is very ethusiastic about his subject matter."
4,Entertaining,"This movie was really entertaining. Nothing more or less. But the big thing here for me was the ability to see gay people for a f#cking change. One of the reviewers summed it up beatifully in his review: ""no one cares if he was bi-sexual or not."" It is percisely this attitude of straight people who make poweful media decisions that leave gay audiences begging to see their lives honestly depicted on screen.So, Mr. and Mrs. Heterosexual, too f%cking bad if you are uncomfortable seeing Colin and Jared stare at each other. Join the club. Do you know how bored I am seeing heterosexuals fondle and grope at each other all for the possibility of selling me deodorant or cereal?A good movie. An even better opportunity for honest portrayal of gay lives."
2,Disappointed In Stone & Farrell,"I expected a lot more from Oliver Stone especially after reading the product description. I expected to see a Gladiator/Spartacus type of movie which added to my disappointment. While it may have been historically accurate and even though I'm not a prude as I was a prison guard for 25yrs. the sexual immorality as Stone depicted in the movie which he portrayed to be Alexander's heart throbs, was disgusting. In addition, to see Colin Farrell galavanting around looking for his next love affair in a blond wig was also very disappointing.Hopes this helps to give a complete review whether you agree with my summary or not."
3,"It wasnt great, but its do-able.","Like others have said, the movie didnt reach expectations. It could have been way better. But I'm not gonna rip apart the movie and critize every little detail. If you enjoy epic movies like this, you should see this movie. Although it failed to even come close to making it on my ""Best Movies"" list, I still enojoyed watching this film."
1,Terrible! What happened Oliver?,This movie doesn't even deserve the star i gave it. It was a terrible waste of talent on Stone's part and the trailer decieved the public making the film look epic. All that Alexander gave the audience was three minutes of epic battle and three hours of unwanted guy on guy. A dreadful film. Don't go see it or buy it when it comes out.
1,I'd Give It Zero But You can't Submit It Like That,"This movie is a classic example of what not to do. The acting was crapy, the scenes were to long, and they overemphasize that Alexander was [...]. One good thing came out of this movie though. I learned that I like my sprite better when I drink it with a straw than when I drink it with a red licorice. Over all I'd give it two thumbs cut off and thrown on the ground, [...]"
3,Not as bad as I thought but...,"Thought I was watching an episode of Ballykissangel. Most of the actors had thick Irish brogues, except Angelina Jolie who appeared to sound Russian. Confused the daylights out of me."
3,Okay for The Story Line,"I was a bit disappointed after watching this movie. I watched this movie with an open mind and did not read reviews prior to watching this movie. I actually had expected to be entertained more or on the edge of my seat more based on the trailer I had watched. If you like Angelina Jolie and Colin Farrell, then just watching a movie with them in it is entertaining enough. The story line is kind of hard to follow because of all the flashbacks type scenes. This is of course so as to not give away to much too quickly. But it kind of bored me after awhile. I usually love this kind of movie and enjoyed the movie ""Troy"" just fine. If you don't know anything about Alexander then the Love story of the movie may be interesting enough for you. It is not the best movie I have seen, but it is okay entertaining if you want something different."
2,"three strikes, you're out.","MMMM... I don't know what I was expecting. I had only seen the original theatrical release some time ago. Disapointed with that version. I can't see anything remarkably different here. The basic product is flawed and no ammount of rejigging is going to create something amazing. I've seen Farrell in other stuff and he can act, with presence. See ""intersection"" I think its called, a great little Irish film where he plays a thug, very impressive. Real menace. Shame that was not allowed to come across here."
1,The Agony,"Alexander, Revisited an expanded version of the original only adds more time to the agony of an already poorly produced film. While the battle scenes are amoung the best I've ever seen, the editing all but destroyswhat should have been a great story. I only bought it so I could say I had all 3 versions. On this I give 4 thumbs down."
1,Did not like this movie at all...,"I am usually very easy to please when I see a movie, all I really want is to be entertained for a couple of hours. But thismovie was such a dissapointment. The subject matter was great,but Alexander was portrayed as such a whinner. I felt more sympathy for his boy hood friend and lover than I did him. There were some good moments in the movie, but I honestly did not think it would ever end. Who cares if he was bisexual (or gay)? But I did not need to be beaten over the head with it and felt the movie focused on this more than his amazing accomplishments. Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer played great parts, but were in the movie very little. My husband hated the movie and he likes everything."
1,Alexander The (Not So) Great.,"Well this movie managed to do what all other pieces on Alexander did. It completely ruined the historical figure as a hero for me.Stone has portrayed Alexander as being nothing but a drunken, boy loving, mamma's boy-with a serious oedipal complex. Who did nothing but butcher his way across the known world. What's so great about that? I thought that Alexander wanted to conquer the known world in order to civilize it. Not according to this movie. No Alex did it to get away from Mommy.The movie is bloated, and boring. People don't talk they give speeches. It is just plain awful.I don't know how accurate this film is regarding Alexander's life. But if it isn't I hope someone comes in and rectifies it."
1,How does this have 3 stars?,"Not very often do my wife & I watch a movie & NOT get anything out of it. Almost 3 hours later, we could not connect or feel for the main character of Alexander. The war scenes were rapid, almost too fast, lots of spraying/squirting blood & gross noises. After watching, we just did not feel like it had entertained AT ALL and were surprised that Oliver Stone released such a sleeper. Dialogue was too ""far out"" to understand really, and considering the star power here, it goes to show that even Angela Jolie & Anthony Hopkins cannot save a poor movie."
2,Rented It,"Alexander conquered most of the known world in the BCs. Historically, he was a fighter class man. Unfortunately he was homosexual, dying of grief after his lover passed on. Overall, a decent Holywood effort of bringing the Alexander the Great story to film. Worth seeing maybe once."
1,Subpar,"Well, from seeing this movie, I can say that this movie doesn't live up to Alexander's name(""The Great""). I thought that the story was totally contrived and the acting wasn't very good. The only reason why I watched this movie at all is to see Angelina Jolie and Rosario Dawson.This movie was a disappointment and I would stay away from it."
1,"Horrible, slow, confusing, gratuitous everything","How bad can a movie be? If TROY wasn't bad enough, now we have to sit through something even worse? A hero and actor playing him even worse than Brad Pitt as Achilles. Over the top violence, stop spearing the horse already. Ridiculous accents by everyone involved including Jolie. Oliver Stone needs to get a grip or an editor for his screenplays. This one was terribly disjointed and very confusing. The viewer doesn't even like Alexander or anyone else. Nothing compelling in the film whatsoever. I would not recommend it to anyone.This was such a bad movie. I wanted to like it, I love the Alexander legends! But it was so sadly poor to be almost pathetic. Angelia Jolie was an utter wooden disaster in her role. The movie just didn't hang together and the character relationships were lacking. It wasn't at all the rousing epic it was supposed to be. Too much pomp and not enough circumstance."
2,"Jeezus, Angelina your so hot but your TERRIBLE lately","I even like Colin too, but he's speaking in an IRISH accent the whole movie. Angelina's accent is Russian, and the movie is just one bad turn after another. It's almost unwatchable. A guy on the plane sitting next to me (with no sound) said it looked like a horrible movie just glancing at it.You want to watch it because you think it can't be THAT bad, it's a big budget production after all. Think again..The sad thing is we'll have to wait another 10-20 yrs for someone to remake Alexander the way it should be."
2,lame,"If you want to see emotion-choked actors sobbing and chewing their way through Babylonian furniture, watch this movie. In one scene I actually predicted that Alexander was about to cry out ""Do you want to live forever?"", a gratuitous, hackneyed phrase that peppers poor-man's epics and brands the film an amateurish effort. If you want to learn about Alexander the Great, read a book. Start with Arrian.And why was a horrifically UGLY individual chosen to play Roxanna? That was a tough face to look at on a big screen and even on a small one too."
1,COLIN YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANOTHER MOVIE INSTEAD OF THIS ONE!!!!!,Alexander is a waste of time and your money so if i was you i would not rent or buy this movie!!!!! What happen Colin why this movie????? You could have done another one!!!!!! Like i said don't waste your time on this movie it's not worth it!!!!!
1,"okay, so Alexander is gay.","You'll scream, you'll cry, you'll kiss six bucks goodbye.Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" is anything but great. This three hour doorstopper spends an inordinate amount of time explaining to the viewer that Alexander likes men...so what. He was a military genius that conquered most of the known world and Stone barely gives that fact a glance. I have seen JFK and NIXON, so I really did not expect any historical accuracy, however at least the previous films were interesting. Stone seems to believe that the only thing that matters in life is what one does with his/her genitals.The film boasts an impressive cast: Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer and Colin farrell; unfortunately he uses them to create silly stereotypes: Women are femme fatale's, heterosexual men are rapists and gay men wear too much eye shadow.If you would like to save yourself three hours of pain and seven bucks, let me tell you the point of this film: Alexander is gay."
1,A great sleep aid,"I liked Gladiator, Troy, King Arthur, and Kingdom of Heaven.So, Alexander has got to be something I would enjoy because it's a similar genre, right? Wrong, it's not in the same class as the other movies I mentioned. I fell asleep less than halfway through the first part. I did not try to watch it again.Nothing about the brief part of this movie that I saw captured my interest. Nothing."
2,The hats were good...,"Normally I don't agree with the pointy-headed intellectuals who write newspaper movie reviews, but for once they were right -- this film is awful.To begin with, the life of Alexander is one of those stories that is TOO BIG to fit into a movie of normal length. There are too many characters, too many battles, too much politics, too many drunken brawls. It really calls for the TV miniseries format.But Oliver Stone made a tough job worse by using every trite gimmick in the B-movie director's arsenal -- flashbacks without warning, people reading letters, a silly narration by an old veteran (does this make the whole movie a flashback???), and so help me, a sequence where the colors are all changed!!! Ed Wood could have done a better job. To get my brain cells working again, I had to watch SPARTACUS three times.I gave the movie 2 stars because the spears and armor are historically correct, and the Macedonians even wear authentic floppy sun hats."
4,Alexander Revisited - the Final Cut - Promise?,"Okay, I saw the theatrical release and I bought the director's cut. Both were entertaining and visually stunning but disappointing. Alexander was such a complex character and accomplished so much in such a short life, and the film just didn't capture that adequately. A montage of his conquests in Phoenecia, Syria, and Egypt might, for example, have dramatized the extent of his accomplishments before Gaugamela. Also, the question of whether he truly thought of himself as divine after his visit to Siwah in Egypt might have provided a pivotal moment. The ""Final Cut"" is much better than its predecessor versions - clearer and, at the same time, more nuanced. I actually liked it very much. Not sure I would have felt so positive about it if the earlier versions hadn't been disappointing."
1,worse than i thought it could have been,"terrible. boring. blah. i read the reviews when it was in the theaters and thought 'hmm big names, oliver stone, couldn't be that bad.' rented it, jeez was i wrong. such a mammoth figure in world history reduced to this mess of a film? why do i have the feeling oliver stone never left his tent while filming and took the studio's money and ran? abominably bad movie."
4,Stone finally gets it right.,"Wow this cut is simply awesome way better then the other versions. Oliver Stone finally gets it right this is what should have been in the theaters. Everything flows so well and it's easier to understand. When I first saw this Revisted version I thought right away Stone your beating a dead dog with a stick and nothing you do will improve this movie. I was wrong not only did Stone make a better movie but it feels completely different too. So if you were a fan or somewhat interested in watching this, watch this version and no other."
1,It IS as bad as they say!,Wow. WHAT A TERRIBLE MOVIE! I honestly couldn't even finish it. Do all the characters-except Angelina Jolie-have Irish accents because Colin Farrell couldn't do anything else? I made it about a third of the way thru before I realized it wasn't going to get any better. What else to say. Don't waste your time on this movie. Go out and walk around the block for 3 hours-you'll get more out of it.
3,Very average,"Read above for the synopsis of the movie.This is an overlong, very average film. Visually stunning, the sets, the action, the actors, but hugely flawed.For a start - why are all the men Irish and Scottish?????? Dont actors get paid to act these days? Angeline Jolie was the only one to attempt an accent (and very well she does too - she was underused unfortunately).The film is very bitty, suddenly jumping years, sometimes missing important events, but referring to them in the (boring) narration. Which brings me on to Anthony Hopkins role as the narrator - boring and unnecessary.So, as a whole, enjoyable, visually impressive, but over long, and poorly directed. (Better then Troy though!)"
5,wicked,This was a really great movie starring colin farrell. with some of the best epic battle scenes ever seen on a movie. and this movie was by far colins best along with swat.
5,the movie of the year,"alexander was by far the greastest colin farrell movie ive ever seen. that has a phenomenal storyline, and loads of action. so if you liked troy or other war movies this movie is a must see."
1,Oliver Stoned and Alexander,"I have had a sore spot for Oliver Stone since he made the movie JFK, which was and is a travesty. I put offwatching this movie just because he made it, even though I love the epic and historical genre. Well I finallygave in and watched it. I force myself to respect the readership of these forums and not use prolific profanityin describing this movie. I will settle for this advice -- Don't waste your time. dxr"
1,It Stinks! Don't waste your money.,I gave it one star because you wouldn't allow me to rate it lower. Like all of this Director's work it is revisionist and contrary in spirit to anything that can be found in ancient history annals.
2,Bad Movie,"I thought this movie was everything that the critics said. It was bad. I thought Colin Farrell was totally miscast, as was Angelina Jolie as his MOTHER? Val Kilmer was pretty bad too. All that said, I think that the story of Alexander was or is just too vast and it seemed like they were trying to throw all his story into one movie and it was like trying to cram 50 pounds of gay love into a 5 pound reel of film. I guess that Alexanders sexuality might be bi/homosexual/insestuous with his mother or whatever but really, who cares? With all the magnificent things he did in his short life Oliver Stone seems to want to concentrate on his sexuality more than putting time into making a good movie. Jared Letos part as Colin Farrells boytoy was nauseating not because they were lovers but because his character was underdeveloped and basically consisted of he and Farrell making goo goo eyes at each other every time they were in each others site.This is simply just not a good movie."
2,CRAP,"This movie was just dumb,it was extremely boring. Anthony Hopkins needs to shut the hell up!my god he nearly bored me to death and the battle scenes were not very good."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Good","I saw this movie opening weekend and the title says it all. The movie itself was 2.5 hours due to poor editing, thus creating a very slow paced film. I won't rehash the plot since everyone else has done a good job ot that but I will say that the movie follows the life of Alexander from early childhood until death and then 40 years after death. The very boring early childhood/teenage sequences which took 30-40 minutes could have been presented in under 10 minutes. Instead the movie was forced into a very slow start which many found to be tedious. If you can get past the slow and boring begining you will find this to be an ok movie. Would I reccomend seeing this on the theatre? No, not worth the $$$. But definetly worth a rental."
1,Just a bad movie of epic proportion,"Really bad movie. After the first 30 minutes, we did turn off the soundtrack and did the character voices ourself. THIS was the entertaining part of the movie!!!The only good thing i have to say about this movie, is that it is SO BAD, that there will be other movies made on Alexander's life in the future..."
3,They cut stuff!,"I rented the movie, I liked it, and I figured the Director's Cut would just add more awesomeness to the whole experience..... instead everything moves slightly faster, they must have cut a minute here and a minute there, a few seconds here and a few more there, so it would ""move faster"".. WTF? since when does a Director's Cut remove material?????????? well, now I guess, what a rip off."
2,alexander wasn't that bad..........,"I really hoped alexander would be an awesome movie. it has its peaks............its good action scenes......but,i saw this movie because of ANGELINA and COLIN..........but i was a little thrown off by angelina's accent. im not sure about that, it was beautiful blend of many accents.....but still confusing why she did have one.colin was jumping in bed with boys alot. not a very good sight x[i re-watched the movie to see if i missed anything important, the acting and script wasn't bad. the story of alexander was epic.the music fit the greek battles well. i'de rather have u rent the movie then buy it =]written by her daughter colette 14yrs xD <-------------"
1,Hollywood at it....again,"Oliver Stone has made a career out of beserching honorable people he does not agree with and inventing drama where none exists. In the case of Alexander, there is a wealth of potential for a wonderful epic. However, Stone, ever the Hollywood liberal, turns it into an expose on the gay lifestyle. Who cares if Alexander was gay, or if he had a complicated relationship with his mother. The fact is, he was one of the greatest warriors and military strategists of all time. However, in this version, all that is incidental to his relationship with his boyfriend. If David Lean were alive, THEN, we would have seen an epic of epic proportions. His portrayal of Lawrence of Arabia (a character similar to Alexander in many respects) portrayed the complexity of his character, including allusions to his sexuality, with class and in line with the overall storyline. However, Lean was a great film maker. Oliver Stone is many things, but, a great film maker? Me thinks not!!"
1,Way Over Cooked,'CLICHES' The only word to describe this dinasaur. Like many of the great filmmakers from the 70's and 80's they've lost their grip! You can get the whole story on the History Channel anyway.Where does all this money come from?? Isn't anyone watching the store.
1,STINKER,"Having just slogged my way through this marathon of messiness, I must conclude that a better ""final cut"" would have been into little pieces with a scissors. However impressive visually, the battle scenes are almost impossible to follow. Everything else is boring and/or repetitious. I've not seen previous versions of this clunker, but if this is the best of the three, I can only conclude that its initial critical drubbing was understated. I can recommend this cut only to those who value length and cheapness above all else."
2,Alexander the Mediocre,A very average film. A little hard to follow with all the narration done by Anthony Hopkins in telling the story of Alexander and his quest to conquer the known world. Alexander 'the great' who amassed the greatest empire the world had ever seen. The story begins with Alexander as a boy to his passage through India and back again.The film makes hints of Alexander's bisexuality but doesn't go any farther than subtle suggestions. The action scenes are average with a less inspiring speeches than what we've seen recently in Troy and King Arthur. Colin Farrell looked a bit odd with his dark eyebrows and bleached hair. Angelina Jolie however was cast perfectly and did a magnificient job.
1,"So Very, Very Bad","Most people aren't going into a sword and sandal flick, even a pretentious one, expecting them to get the history right so the fact that this is a frustrating mix of getting things really wrong and doing a good job of dramatizing other things isn't important. The real issue is that this is a jumbled up mess of a movie. The story jumps back and forth in time with little context for what is happening. It has a large cast of characters with names that are unfamiliar to American ears and does little to make many of the supporting characters stand out as individuals so it's often confusing as to who is doing what and why. Stone spends most of the movie minimizing Alexander's relationship with Hephaestian as much as possible but then has to quickly set things up so that Alexander's grief makes some sort of sense. Even at three hours it feels like there was a lot of material cut out that would have made this thing into a coherent film."
3,Good movies,"The first time I watched this movie was a few days ago. I lost interest in the beginning. A lot of talking, then action, then back to talking. I didn't start to give it my attention till the middle of the movie. I liked what I was watching so last night I gave it another chance watching it from the beginning till the end. It is a good movie."
1,Collin Farrell as Alexander?,"Collin Ferrell as Alexander the Great. Need you say more. Nothing against Farrell, he is mediocre for most things, but not a strong leading man by any stretch. As soon as you saw he was to portray Alexander, quite possibly the greatest conquerer of all time, you knew that it would be difficult to take at best. He is just not capable of selling that kind of strength and power. Few people are. That being said, when it came on cable I had to check out, despite my misgivings, as I am a huge admirer of Alexander and his achievements. I had hoped that there might be some good battle scenes, or at least that some of the brilliant tactics might have been covered, but as far as I could see there was nothing good about this film. I am not a fan of Oliver Stone, but this type of movie, if it were done any where near right, is clearly far out of his league."
1,I want my 3 hours back!,"Yes, I sat through the 3 hours. I thought with Oliver Stone directing and Anthony Hopkins co-starring there might be SOME substance, but the film is basically 3 hours of yelling, Roman-style fighting, and Jolie's laughably fake accent. Nothing could have saved this turkey."
2,Very disappointed,"When the movie started, my expectations were high. I expected many battle scenes. I expected it tell the whole story of ALexanders life, and actually tell the audience why he was called the great. It turns out that a majority of the movie was of Alexander with his friend Hephastion having gay moments. The 2 battle scenes are pretty majestic, but the homosexual scenes were really disturbing. I wanted to leave the movie theater early if I wasnt with friends. It was really that bad. COlin Ferril usually is a really good acting but only with a good storyline. This movie really stinks. A great cast but this movie couldn't deliver anything."
2,Bah,"Not quite the ""Alexander's gay romp"" that my friends made it out to be, but not the quality of epic historical movie we have seen in the past decade or so.Angelina Jolie was the the only believable roll out of the bunch.."
2,Boring,"The movie was boring. Farrel was miscast. I just didn't believe anyone would follow him to the ends of the earth, let alone a whole army. He was a good actor, but he seemed out of place in the ancient world. Jolie had a strange accent and even a stranger role. The movie just sort of stopped when she was on.The battle scenes which were usually Stone's forte, were boring. The movie flipped back and forth several times in flashbacks. This did not help the already diffused narrative thread. Alexander's sexuality was addressed. I guess it was supposed to be better in the director's cut, but it was still not very well done. A pouting boyfriend hanging around in the background with no substantial role was not interesting. Alexander's wife had very little to do too.The good parts are the exotic scenery and the supporting caste, except for Jolie. Plummer, Kilmer, and Hopkins were good. I just had a hard time sitting through it."
3,Later,"I haven't actually seen this movie yet! I've heard many bad reviews (although I hate critics and think they're just boring people whom, from their childhood years, were ignored and now just waste time trying to judge others) Also, critics do not jusdge movies on their story most of the time! They judge the acting! Now, I'm not a fan of any actor, but Colin Farrell is a good one! Critics are the most close-minded people! I have now read some good reviews on this movie and I think it's very much worth seeing (in the comfort of my home...theatre is a ripoff and a terrible experience...except for The day after tomorrow or The Perfect Storm) One review I read was terrible though...Trevor Cross! He said he's married with children...but, he loves fagets entirely too much and that was 80% of his review...fagetry! I think he just married to have the kids like the Greeks did! I think after I download this movie...I'll cut out the disgusting parts for my viewing enjoyment!"
1,TURKEY AWARD IN WAITING...,"If I could give this a negative number, it would have it!!!I am so glad I didn't pay to see that movie in the theaters!!!! You would think that with an all star cast,even the worst script would have potential with the likes of Anthony Hopkins (one of the greatest actors ever) and a beauty like Angelina Jolie not to mention Director Oliver Stone...so what happend?"
4,Worth It For the Music,"I like this cut of the film, but I especially love the incredible music. Vangelis is a genius."
2,Don't say we didn't warn you!,"Yep, it really is that bad. I was going to write a review, but instead, if you are considering watching this film, I'd suggest you go over to rottentomatoes and read the large collection of professional reviews. They pretty much say it all--just a grand, big budget mess of a film. The serious acting is comical, the plot is pointless, and Angelina, who are you kidding with that ridiculous accent? I think the best review would be by a psychoanalyst trying to psychoanalyze Oliver Stone through this movie. I think there's a lot of frustrated subconscious mucking about in this one. Of course, now that you've heard it's so bad you'll want to watch it just to see how bad it is. Use the fast forward a lot--you'll feel better if you do. I'll give it two stars for a few moments of good historical recreation, especially the elephant stuff."
2,"Focus, people.","The movie was okay. Just that. Nothing more. I, for one, couldn't care less about Alexander's sexual orientation. Too many reviewers do. Focus on the film, people! The movie itself had moments of greatness, but was too long, too disjointed, and lacked any sort of clarity. In most battle scenes you simply couldn't tell what was happening. There was none of the sense of tactics or purpose that characterized battle scenes in Braveheart or Gladiator. The director's habit of leaping backward and forward in time was confusing and awkward. Some movies benefit from these temporal leaps (Pulp Fiction or Momento) but Alexander does not. Last, there was some BAD casting. Angelina Jolie as Colin Farrel's mother? Come on. All in all, not Oliver Stone's greatest effort."
2,Ineffective use of some good actors,"And by good actors, I'm not including Colin Farrell. Much longer than it needed to be, this film's storytelling was not so hot. Too many ""main topics"" to keep my interest in any single one. Farrell's constant bewildered countenance was tiresome. Unsure why there was a need to make his bisexuality and race-mixing ideals such a major part of the story. It's the 21'st century... Most of us have accepted, if not embraced, it as normal. It somehow gave me the impression that featuring these ""hot button"" themes were to make Alexander seem freakish. Or at least not mentally sound. Or maybe this is an indication that we, as a civilized society, stillhave a long way to go before everyone is accepted equally."
4,Enjoyed the movie,"I personally could not understand why the critics panned this production, perhaps it was because the movie showed Alexander's lover (Hephistion) - I am not sure, but I found the love afair refreshing and in very good taste."
1,waste of film,"about 10 seconds of rosario dawson topless and 1/2 hour of battle scenes (desert battle average - elephant battle pretty good) doesn't make up for the remaining 2 1/2 hours of puerile rot. it is a common failing of directors making movies of ancient heroes to attempt to connect with modern mores - macedonians bringing freedom and western values to the middle east, in this case. the persian empire of darius was probably more open, and certainly more sophisticated than the macedonian one. and, in any event, alexander was concerned only with conquest and certainly did not suffer from the angst manifested by mr. stone's updated counterpart. i did kind of enjoy alexander's yiddishe momma (angelina jolie) describe how great zeus was in bed."
1,Stone me!,"I bought this in the hope that the critics had been wrong about the film. They hadn't been. It is quite awful, especially for those of us who hate snakes. The Irish accents; the cutting from one point in time to another...and back again. After an hour I was bored; after ninety minutes I was desperate. It took two seperate viewings to reach the end. I sensed a director trying to be too clever by half instead of telling a story coherently and well. I doubt I shall watch it again."
1,"Rent it if you're interested, do NOT buy it......","Oh my gosh!! It's TOTALLY UNEXPECTED to see this DVD in the top sellers and in top 10!! I don't even know why!! This film sucks! It's probably the WORST film i have EVER watch!! Listen, if you haven't watch this film and you're interested and u are willing to buy it, I suggest you rent it.... It's not worth it!!....><"
1,Wow this movie couldn't have been made worse!,"I couldn't make it through this movie because it is way to long and it doesn't focus on anything but how gay Alexander is. The gay scenes in this movie were just to interupting of the flow of the story and in actuallity did not have much to do with histories portrail of him. Now that I have gotten that out of the way.I don't know about anybody else but why in the hell would you cast Colin Ferrell who doesn't look like he could fight his way out of a paper bag? I would think less of a pretty boy and someone more rugged like Russell crow with some curly locks! Im sure he was quite the ladies man and the mans man but pale skin wimps are not convincing to cast as one of the greatess leaders of the ancient world. Boring, bland and a snoozer!"
1,Terrible movie. Not what I expected at all.,"If you are looking for homosexual romance scenes with virtually no battle scenes, then this is the movie for you.I don't usually right reviews, but I felt this movie was such a waste of time I had to put in my two cents. What happened to the story of Alexander the Great? Well, if you are looking for it, you won't find it in this movie. Angelina Jolie, plays herself basically -an evil woman who some sort of stupid accent.Colin Farrell is not the type of actor(with his being short alone) to play a lead role such as Alexander.I am able to find at least something good in even the worst of movies, but I could not find one redeeming thing in this terrible movie."
2,STRIKE THREE!!,"I find it hard to believe that even a director of Oliver Stone's fame would be granted a free pass to try not once, but three times to make a bad movie presentable. Essentially, every time one version of this film--which manages, amazingly, to be neither exciting in terms of action nor well-developed in terms of characters despite its long running time--flops, Stone makes another one. Is this THIRD attempt better than the original? I believe so. But in my opinion, this is too little, too late."
1,The closest thing to a gay flick I'd ever want to see,"save your money and 'if' you see this film, don't eat anything before you watch it. Where is that little pen thing from ""Men in Black"" so I can erase the images in my mind, yuck!!!"
2,Not happy customer,"I ordered this DVD, but it had scrathes on it, then I requested a replacement. I got the replacement very quick; however, I never got the return label to send the defective DVD. I asked twice via email for the return label but they never sent it to me. I could not get a phone number to contact someone, all their customer service is done via email :-( I had to pay for the return shipping and never got reimbursed. I am not a happy customer."
1,Had to get it,This movie was awful...i saw it in theaters but I had to buy it because I have all of Colin Farrells movies and this was the cheapest place to buy it. I heard the Directors Cut is much better...havnt seen it but dont really care to.
4,"final version, good","if u saw the first version and felt like you got cheated out of a overall good oliver stone experience, check this out and it should be redeming. I felt the first version had a lot of the stone elements i like minus the good film. this fits nicely and worth seeing."
1,AWFUL!,"I watched some of this on TV and it was sooooo bad, I turned the channel. I went back to it a while later, and it was still BAD. Bad casting, really bad acting, bad cheap-looking costumes, bad sets, bad editing, bad screenwriting, bad, bad, bad.... This film is junk. It flopped in theaters too. I'd have given it No Stars, but I had to chose something to go further....'nuf sed."
3,"not terrible, not great, not quite satisfying","This was a well acted, but badly put together movie. It would have been better if there wasn't so much hype about how bad/good it was. Since the bad reviews only mentioned the homosexuality as a crititcism, I thought it would be amazing. I was disappointed, but it wasn't awful."
1,Biggest waste of time spending at the Cineplex,"Don't EVEN think about going out to see this movie-or You'll be SORRY! 3 hours wasted, 7 bucks go down the drain, This movie reminds me of another Warner Bros.' largely-produced Brad Pitt epic, ""TROY"". For the Money, Go see ""National Treasure"", ""The Incredibles"", or ""Christmas with the Kranks"", with Tim ""The Toolman"" Taylor"". You won't be disapointed! Oh, by the way-29-year old Angelina Jolie plays mom to 28-year old Colin Farrell WHAT a sick IDEA!"
1,I recommend documentary,"This movie consists of one long speech after another mostly by Farrell. Messy battle scenes, cut in between these speeches that give no indication of Alexander and his generals great military tactics. There's no intrigue, no story to tell. Don't waste your 3 hours. Check out the A&E or History channel documentary instead. It has more depth more intrigue and more appreciation for the Great Alexander."
1,Great battle scenes the rest stinks.,There are only two battle scenes in the entire 214 minutes. The battle scenes were great. The rest of the movie sucks rooster eggs. I was going to toss it in the garbage. I decided to keep the dvd just to watch the two battle scenes.
1,TRASH! Not worthy it.....,I only saw the first 15 minutes and that was enough. I should have read the Christian reviews before buying it. I like period and war epic movies but I'm not a fan of Angelina Jolie. I hesistated when I saw her name and THAT was a SIGN not to buy it. Too much seductive and suggestive body language. Abusive behavor and battering. Hated it because there's too much gay stuff going on which made me sick to my stomach. [...]
2,What a mess,"Being a hardcore costume drama fan, I was hoping to like this movie and tried to be open minded, despite viewing Oliver Stone as mixed bag. Plot, motivation, characterization, dialog. This movie had none of these. Some nice images, interesting set design for Babylon. But not even a Platoon of big name celebs could save this near turkey."
1,"Awful, awful, awful!","I had heard from several people several different opinions about this movie. I, therefore, went into the viewing of it with an open mind. I became bored in the first 1/2 hour. The script plods along in a seemingly mindless and pointless lack of direction. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse...it did. The lackluster battle scenes, the lack of a well-written story line, and the prurient inclusion of homo-erotic and attempted rapes are not a substitute for good writing, acting and directing. The story of the REAL Alexander is better served by NOT viewing this movie. The sheer length of the movie (nearly 3 hours) is ample time to get it right, but the movie fails to do so.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone that wants to enjoy a good story of an incredible historical character. This movie is best left collecting dust on the shelf."
1,This movie has nothing for anybody.,Those who are interested and know anything about ancient Greece and Alexander the Great will be disappointed in this movie for its glaring inaccuracies. Those who don't probably won't understand what's going on for most of the movie. About the only good thing I can say is that Hephaistion was pretty so there was something to look at during this overlong movie that still managed to leave out a lot of important information.
2,Alexander (2-Disc Widescreen Special Edition),"Great movie. The problem is in the medium of delivery. There are 2 dvds in the package. Each dvd contains approximately 1/2 of the movie. The audience/customer would be better served if the entire movie was on one dvd.In addition, the 2nd dvd is defective. The scene where Alexander's father is assasinated consists of some normal footage, many lengthy 'still' pictures, no picture at all for a period of time, and a short period that looked like satelite feed was breaking -- all on a dvd that's supposed to be flawless."
3,BAD script,This movie isnt really that bad. The movie really picks up when Rosario came on the screen. Looked like the writing was awful. The long dialog sequences were too soap operaish and laughable. They should have concentrated more on the historical facts than all the homosexuality.
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Too long to function as high camp and too silly to be watched with a straight face (Angelina Jolie's accent! Colin Farrell's haircut!), Alexander's only real success is to prove that the infamous 1963 version of Cleopatra didn't end big-budget sword and sandals fiascos."
2,Way too Graphic!,"Although I knew something about Oliver Stone's reputation for shock-value, I was surprised at the level of graphic sex portrayed. Since it was not rated, I should have been more alert as to the probable content. Casting Brad Pitt as Alexander and Anjelica Jolie as HIS MOTHER was certainly a stretch, although if he was born when she was 12-15 years old, the age difference probably wasn't that important. I doubt I would ever watch this movie again and found it a waste of over three hours. Amazon's price caught my eye and influenced my decision to buy. I have a hard time passing up a bargain. In addition, it was rated as far superior to the earlier Alexander the Great, which I also purchased for a comparison. I still have not watched this earlier version."
1,The WORST Historical Film I have ever endured,"I am a big fan of historical epics - this is the biggest disappointment in historical epic movies I have ever seen.Simply put: BAD script, BAD acting, TERRIBLE score (ridiculous choice of Vangelis to write backing music for an historical epic) - and OH MY GOODNESS WOULD IT NEVER END?I would not recommend wasting the time to see this movie - a true disappointment. Oliver Stone succeeded in taking a potentially larger-than-life historical figure and making his story boring!"
2,uhhhhh......,"This movie lost it's own path fast, and never got it back. Oliver Stone should really stay away from Historical Action/Drama.From after the first ten minutes i was astounded at how this movie had more scenes but never really went anywhere. Alexander himself never seemed to win any battle, or be anything but a spoiled screw up let alone a leader, a king.And then there was the 'acting', wow i have never seen a warrior cry so much. personally i was glad when Alexander died and the movie was over."
2,Wrong Leads,"Oliver Stone's ""Alexander Revisited"" has quite a lot going for it, sweeping shots of gorgeous mountaintops, epic battles, stunning and shockingly realistic in nature and a story of a legend named Alexander. What it doesn't have is an actor worthy of portraying this tormented dreamer, bent on conquering all of Asia. Stone has Colin Farrell, with bleached blonde hair and some of the worst line reading in history.Although Farrell isn't alone in his campy and over reaching acting skills, we have Angelina Jolie doing the best 'Natasha' voice since Rene Russo in the ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"", and the poorest acting by pretty-boy Jared Leto, in quite some time.I never did view the chopped up mess that hit the theatres, this version is a little long and heavy on dialogue and light on action. but if they only chose different actors, this one would have been a masterpiece in waiting."
1,Just too over the top,"there are so many things wrong with this movie -- as a movie, not as a retelling of history, but as a story meant to entertain and provide escape from boredom!But the thing that got me -- really got me -- what was with EVERYONE having an Irish accent????really! too much!"
2,wanabe epic,"I never studied Alexander in school or I missed the documentary on The History Channel so I didn't know what to expect from this movie. At the very least I expected something a little more improved and ""grounded"" than that previous wanabe epic classic ""Troy"".Avoid this movie. Alexander is long, boring, confusing, and devoid of emotion. I didn't connect with the characters. I didn't get Alexander's character. While everyone was trying to figure out if he was straight or gay I was trying to understand his reasons for conquest. Was it to please his father? Was it to please his mother? Was it because he was insane?When the great Sir Anthony Hopkins is delivering a 20 minute speech about this great man and I'm yawning you know it's time to go especially when this speech is at the beginning of the film.For what it's worth I was glad to see Angelina working again and the opening credits were gorgeous."
1,Unwatchable,"The life of Alexander the Great continues to defy cinema treatment, which is too bad, because Alexander had an enormous impact on world history. The 1956 version with Richard Burton didn't exactly set the world on fire, but at least it was watchable. This mess from Oilver Stone is about as hideous as movies get. Avoid this turkey"
5,Oliver Stone's Alexander Revisited - a success!,"Oliver Stone's third try at revising his biopic of Alexander the Great has been a success. The story line is now much clearer and cleaner. The film brings us much closer to the man and his military successes. Though the story of Alexander the Great will never clearly separate the myth from the man because of the extensive passage of time and the loss of physical evidence including the destruction of written contemporary history about the man and his accomplishments which were stored in the tragically burnt down Library of Alexandria in Egypt, I felt that this final revisit of this film by Oliver Stone has brought us closer to the essence of the man who was hailed as ""Megas Alexandros"". It is my hope that this version will stand out as the version which will recognize Stone's fine effort to present the great conqueror's life and story. I encourage others to take the time to look at this new version of the Alexander film."
2,Gay Men With Mullets and Celtic Accents,"Alexander is portrayed as a neurotic and tortured individual who is shoved into power and conquest by his mother and turned into a monster by lust for authority. The character in this movie appears to have very little in common with the ambitious and thoughtful young man described by Aristotle. Watching this movie you get the feeling that Alexander and his men were a gang of sexually confused young boys who conquered the ancient world pretty much by accident.There is far too much emphasis here on the non-essential, and every conflict in this story is a contrived account of Alexander's strained relationships with his mother, father, friends and his own identity. If you're looking for a narrative on the epic story of the most important figure of ancient Greece, look elsewhere. This is the story of insignificant things in the life of a man who happened to be significant."
1,Not quite...,"If your impression of Alexander is based on Plutarch's ""Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans,"" then DO NOT WATCH THIS! I understand that interprative leeway is required to accomodate the 2-hour or 3-hour movie format, but this is HORRENDOUS!"
1,Worse than Troy,"The only good that came from this movie is Angelina Jolie... too bad she looks like colins little sister.... well bad for the film, good for the viewer.Oh, and why are there so many reviews of people saying that the movie ""LOOKS LIKE ITS GOING TO BE GOOD"" and giving it a 4 or 5 star rating... nimrods!"
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,I walked out of this movie in the theater. It's the only one out of 300+. That should tell you what kind of terrible film this is.
3,So so if you want simple drawings,"I have used 7.0 SE on Win2KPro for about a year.I really want an updated MacDraw program -- I don't need Canvas's fancy image manipulation features. For my usage, it's far too complex and difficult to use. It is also sometimes gives me a black screen on death, which is not so easy to do on Win2kPro.I also find it difficult to paste its pictures into MSWord2K.Sometimes the pictures don't print right. It may be a Microsoft bug, not a Canvas bug, but if you want seamless integration, be alert."
2,Hardly about the Potty at All,"This is an entertaining enough cartoon for kids to watch, and mine do, but it is only in the most tangential way about learning to use the potty. It's a fifteen-minute movie and the kid doesn't even get the potty for about eight minutes.The fact that everything is in rhyme bugs only me. The kids don't mind, and you do turn it out. The 21-month-old likes it more than the three-year-old. It's probably not a coincidence.We got this with a little book called ""The Potty Book"" about the same little boy with the same art. The book is of great interest to the baby, although it still doesn't really have that much to do with the potty either. The movie and the book are just about an ordinary little boy who learns to use the potty while doing ordinary things. It doesn't tell anyone how to do it."
2,"Kids Like It, But.......","Yes - our son loves this video. However, the grammar is awful, so we'll have to un-teach the bad English, once he's potty trained...... Also - the music is super low-brow, rock-n-roll-ish. I was hoping for a catchy tune which wasn't quite so ..... crappy..... (ha ha ha). In general - if you don't care about the free-fall of culture and civilization, this video will do the trick. If you do, you might want to make your own video, and sell it to the rest of us."
1,The worst dvd ever!,This movie is absolutely annoying and my son doesn't even like the movie! My daughter who is seven was like not this again. And I only played it twice. I tried to be positive of the movie but can't. If you are trying to get your child out of the diaper it takes like 7 or 8 minutes to get to the point that you should use the toilet. It talks about doing the doo doo and pee in the diaper and to me that was making it okay for my son to stay in the diaper. Then it goes to using the toilet it to me is confusing I just do not encourage the purchase in this movie!
4,New romantic in his element,"Some reviews here give this show an overall good rating, but comment that Ferry doesn't have a great voice. Far from being a shortcoming, his voice is his greatest asset as far as I'm concerned. His vocal style has often been imitated, but never replicated. With your eyes closed, you know it's Bryan Ferry the instant you hear it. This show finds him elegantly dressed as usual, and the setting is more chamber orchestra than rock band. The only downside to this show, and the reason I'll give it 4 solid stars instead of 5, is that the setlist suffers from pacing at certain points. Other than that, this romantic is in his element in the city of romance."
1,I like Ferry but believe me this one is terrible,"Should I have known this, I wouldn't have never bought itI don't give even a star to the songs selection"
3,"Good condition, slow delivery",Vendor does not notify you when item has shipped (unlike betterworldbooks and Zubal-book). Book was not received by delivery deadline (took 5-6 weeks to receive). Book is in good physical condition.
2,Depends on your knowledge level,Please purchase with caution. Someone with an advance understanding of investments will not find this book useful. More history and description of microcaps than acutal strategies or tips for selections.
5,Great book!,"As an avid investor and market researcher, I found Dan Coker's ""Mastering Microcaps"" to be the standard on investing in microcap companies. Unfortunately, while other books shed light on small caps, Coker goes the extra mile, producing 200+ pages of data on microcaps and how to select microcaps for possible investment. This is definitely the definitive book on the subject and I continue to enjoy reading Bloomberg Professional Library books."
5,happy flag,"This flag is so pretty and bright, it makes me smile every time I see it. It is the perfect size and the prettiest in town!"
4,Knight and Hale Clucker,"This call is great for the price, if you are just starting out this is the way to go. Its not the best for the longer calls, but its great for clucks. I would recomend this for the just starting caller and watch videos online for some help. Great call all around."
2,Knight and hale clicker,For a cheap call it sounds okay. Seems more like an beginner call. I just got it for some diversity on my lanyard but it is not as good as my other calls which were the same price if not a little more
2,Listen up,I bought this item because of the Fluke name. I have used it on several different kinds of lines and most have the same results. It is difficult to hear the tone over the static.
5,HAPPY,I HAVE NO IDEA IF THIS IS ACCURATE OR NOT. ALL I KNOW IS I FINALLY TOSSED THE MERCURY THERM I HAD FOR EVER. IT WORKS FAST AND I AM GLAD I BOUGHT IT
2,"Good for short runs, but not long runs!","I bought this hoping to identify and label all the CAT5 outlets in my house. The builder neglected to label the wires in the switch panel, so I had no idea what was running to where. I connected the tone source to a jack and used the probe in the panel to try to identify the wire. Unfortunately, the signal was not strong enough / loud enough to be detected in the switch panel. I have a two story house and all the wires go through the walls to the attic and back down into the panel on the ground floor. I was only able to detect 1 jack (an upstairs jack with the shortest run of cable). If you have shorter runs of cable, it may work for you, but it didn't do what I needed."
4,Good working at a good price.,"This product works just like it was make out to. Hard to follow cables that are in a cable track signal jumps from wire to wire next to it, but helps. Happy with my product and would buy again."
3,Not a magical tool for CAT5,"I have 30 PCs in a computer Lab. The cable connections were in a mess. So I bought the PRO3000 to organize the cables and to label them according to the PC number. I discovered that in order for the transmitter unit to work properly I need to unplug all the cables from the switches. This was not a big problem, for the fact that I know the location of the switches. Now I have a cable in a different location that I don't know where it ends. In order to track that cable I had to cut the RJ45 plug and connect the alligator clip to the 7th or 8th wire of the CTA5 cable (those wires are not used in IP4 based connection). I was able to track that cable, but I waisted time and energy in cutting and replacing the RJ45.Thus the three stars!!"
3,Fluke Networks 26000900 PRO3000 Analog Tone and Probe Kit,For now I'll give it three stars as I've just received and it works as described . The REAL test is in an RF saturated environment with the noise db level bordering on permanent ear damage . If that test goes through okay I'll increase the star rating. No damage to the product on arrival .
4,Good CD. Much Missing.,"For the most part, this is a great compilation of the score to The Ring and The Ring Two. Although it is a great buy, I must admit, I feel kind of robbed. The score is incomplete. There are many parts missing...for example...in the ending credits to The Ring, once the copyright and legal notices begin to scroll onto the screen, Samara sings the song she sung before her mother murdered her. Also, on the Extra Feature after the movie on the special edition VHS there are more pieces of score that were never included in either movies or the soundtrack. I really, truly love this CD, the key themes are really chilling and give me goosebumps when I listen to them (especially Track 8) I just feel that the composers would've done better by including a complete score to each movie...then again, I guess it's better to keep us guessing which pieces were included and which weren't."
3,About 7 minutes of worthwhile stuff on this,"There are moments of really good material on this, and make it worthwhile to buy for me. However, the 7 minutes seem to be spread out around the first few tracks, so I have to make it through ""oh my god the violins are glissandoing scary music"" to get to the parts I like. Also, the last couple remixes on the end are pretty hilarious. But again, that approximately 7 minutes of material is gorgeous, and worthwhile if you have the patience."
3,Thought these were higher quality,Half of these don't work in my high end commercial CD burner (Marantz)... what a waste of money. Usually Verbatim is very good. Maybe just got a bad batch.
3,Good and bad...,"What's great about this is that the front is almost the same material as the back. Perfect for getting creative with your Sharpies and just going to town on some artsy fartsy cd covers.What's not great about this is that the front is so smooth, that it scratches up really easily."
5,Heartfelt Writing,"Marly Swick knows how to capture her readers. I found the characters entirely empathetic and her poignant style of writing is perfect. Not too sappy, just perfect. The struggle that envelops this family right after a tragic accident paints a beautiful picture of a family slowly reconfiguring themselves"
5,A study in human nature,"A vary sad subject, but wonderfully written. I kept hoping the family would talk through their grief; and that the ending would be different, but the reality is that life does not always give us what we want and this was truly a study of what life dealt these people and how they coped (or didn't). I'm glad to have read this book."
5,"A touching tale of the ""road not taken""",This is a well written novel that has an interesting style of weaving the past and present through the eyes of a dying woman. It makes you wonder if this is what the experience is like. It will touch the heart of those who were lucky (or unlucky) enough to have the experience of a surprise love that was not pursued. How much in her life was compared to that experience. Is this considered a tragedy of life or something special to be treasured. It will make those who have been there wonder.
2,"A good read, could have been better, and a bit dated.","This was a book I couldn't put down. However, with all of the commercial references it seemed as though various companies sponsored the book. There were some parts that contradicted one another, such as Trina's favorite book before she died was Koko, but sometime later the author wrote ""her favorite book after Koko was Green Eggs and Ham,"" which wasn't consistent. The peak of the novel was the very first chapter. A good first chapter is what gets a reader interested in the book, but the rest of the book was a little disappointing."
2,"Tried very hard, largely failed","You'd think that a book about such a horrible topic could avoid stereotypes, cliches, and other boredom, but that's largely what you'll get from these characters. I guess it's the best the author could do, but when they want you to accept the premise of the book, you deserve some depth below just garbage and there isn't any. Don't buy, don't read, don't waste your time."
3,Disappointing read,"I started this book with the promise of a great read - a tragedy that could happen to anyone. But halfway through, I couldn't help wondering - what about the mother's grief for her slain child. Too much of this novel was concentrated on Giselle doing what was best for her son and coping with a self-centered 2nd husband - I guess maybe that was the authors premise in the first place, but I really wanted more depth to Giselle's character. I was only emotionally hit with the last paragraph in the book - that's what hit me like a fist to the stomach."
2,Not as good as it should be,"This one is an okay read. But it is honestly a bit tedious. It's the story of a woman's life after her son accidently kills his 2 year old sister. The horrible tragedy, unfortunately, unfolds in the first two pages of the book so you never really get to see the family that is destroyed by the tragedy. This was a major mistake in story telling. The characters are drawn almost too sympathetically--so that no one is ever to blame for anything. The only character who stuck with me was the son, Teddy. The ending, which is a tacked on scene from several years later is too pat and too self conscious."
3,LCD?,"This TV is nice and compact but the picture quality is not necessarily what I expected. Unless seated at least 5 feet away the picture quality lacks definition and contrast. The coloring is good, as well as the sound. The other reviews are accurate that when you change channels it pauses for a noticeable moment before switching. If you are a channel flipper it can be very annoying. My TV guide and I have become much closer now so I can avoid the annoyance. Despite this, this television is a very good buy for the dollar but if you are looking for spectacular picture quality miniturized then this TV will not quite meet your expectations."
5,The Moving Story of a Girl's growth into a Strong Woman,"This touching and compelling book is so much more than I expected. Reading the back cover, I would never have guessed at how sensitively and successfully the heroine's story would be told. You will be captivated by her dilema. This well researched subject makes Amina's dilema understandable to our western minds because it is put in the context of a girl indoctrinated in a culture that teaches her that she is ""property,"" in a relationship, not a partner. Thus, her ability to develop independent thought and to weigh the consequences of liberated thought and action, make her plight all the more dramatic. Needless to say, I recommend this book!"
4,Escaping the Twilight,"I totally enjoyed this book, very educational. No one should be treated this way,I am amazed at how people devalue the lives of others"
5,great book,This is a very interesting book. At times I could not put the book down. It sure make me glad to be living where I am!
2,Slow Moving Movie,"I watched this for a documentary film class. Most of the movies I watched were good, but this one almost put me to sleep. It follows Dylan around on his concert tour of London. This may be an interesting movie for a Bob Dylan fan, however I found it very slow and boring. There were a couple of humourous parts, but they were few and far between. Overall I wouldn't recommend this movie."
3,Review Of Targus Chill Hub,The Fans work fine and so does the USB 2.0 Hub. The Part to watch out for is the connector in Chillhub for the ower witch becomes loose.Targus AWE01US Notebook ChillHub
4,Targus ChillHub Review,"Overall a well made product. Very useful if your notebook computer gives off heat. I have not used the fan feature, except to give it a test run. My purpose in buying this product was to raise my notebook computer off the desk, allowing the air to ventilate. The built-in 4 USB hubs are located on the left side of the pad, so make sure that this is convenient for you. Also make sure to measure the leg pads on your notebook computer and check that measurement with the chill pad dimensions."
2,Worked for a while...,"I have a Dell Inspiron 8000 with failing fans, so I decided to get a chillhub to try to relieve the pc fans. I am just trying to keep everything working for a few more months, as I will be buying a new pc. I liked the chillhub at first, cannot really tell if they kept things cooler, as I do not have any temperature software loaded.I only give this two stars because the fans are now making a loud grinding noise that is unbearable. I use my pc every day for 6-8 hours, so maybe I burned it out.I think I am just going to buy a $10 desktop fan and shoot it at the side of the laptop and not get another one of these."
5,Cool!,"Great item. Small, portable, light. Extra USB ports a great plus!!. Right up there with the $2.99 USB Snakelights, another big favorite here."
2,Didn't work for my computer,"This design didn't pull enough heat away from my Sony VAIO laptop that always ran hot -- not sure anything in production now would work perfectly, but I know this one didn't."
1,Not worth of money,"If not for the integrated USB hub, it would be just another piece of plastic. Since it doesn't blow air onto the bottom of the laptop - instead it sucks air - it is not at all effective. In fact, it works better with fans turned off."
1,Worthless,This product only worked for a few months. I thought it cooled the laptop very well so I purchased two more to replace it and they have all stopped working. The fans won't spin anymore.
1,mehh,fans stop working after awhile. you have to cut the top part off of the grill to get them to work again. really not a good product but you can mod it if you take it apart. horrible product and not worth 20 bucks
1,This was a waste of money,This product has been absolutely useless.. totally not happy with its performance. I give this product an F- for a grade
2,"Effective, but too LOUD","Somehow, I thought that a product made to work with a laptop would be fairly quiet, or at least offer variable speed so that most of the time it would whisper. I played with this for about 10 minutes and will now just put it on eBay... it makes a quiet MacBook Pro sound like an old PC while raising it to an uncomfortable height. Fellow Mac users, try this first: smcFanControl (Google it). It's an app that lets you set the minimum fan speed, and has dropped my average CPU temp by about 15 degrees. I found it after ordering the Chillhub.Later note: Although loud, I have reached for this a couple of times when the laptop is working hard and heating up, and it DOES cool very dramatically. I just wish it had a speed control."
2,A Failure!,"The twin fans died after only 5 months of use. When it did work, the fans had a pronounced noise. Not really designed with my 17 inch widescreen Dell in mind...too small. The notebook would shift around on the base. The integrated USB hub is a nice feature, which still functions properly. If not for the extra USB ports, I would have rated this 1 star. Just ordered the ""Griffin Technology iCurve Laptop Stand"" from Amazon, which probably will cool just as well, without all the noise, and reliability issues."
1,Very Light Construction,"After about 6 months of use, this actually snapped in half. I certainly would not purchase this again, and will not recommend it."
1,Overpriced junk,"All this is is some cheap plastic with some cheap fans, the USB hub really doesn't justify charging 50 bucks. I've had one of these for a couple years now (bought it while it was on sale at a store). If it works, it does its job, but that's a big if. Sometimes the fans start grinding for no apparent reason for a few minutes, then work perfectly. Sometimes they start grinding, then continue grinding. Powering it on USB (rather than the AC adapter) sometimes resolves the problem (as it runs at lower speed). Lately, one of the fans has been grinding almost continuously, I suspect the motor might be shot."
1,Poor Quality,Worked fine in the beginning. After about a year--after the warranty expired--the fan blades started breaking off (they are made of light cheap plastic). Now the unit is loud and annoying. I wouldn't get another one unless I knew the quality of the fans was better.
1,not very durable,"This product did not last that long. within just a month of using it one of the fans broke down. It started working again only this time the fan sounds like a helicopter is in the room. So i had to tape down one of the fans so at least half of my laptop would stay cool. The usb works great and frees up space however. However you could just buy a cheaper cooler and a separate usb hub. I would totally pass on this and would not recommend this product or brand to anyone else. I'm going to buy the Antec cooler now, hopefully it'll last longer."
4,You're so fine,"This, of course, was Madonna's second album. It featured several smash hits, which are now regarded as '80s pop classics. You are no doubt familiar with those songs, so there is no need for me to discuss them. Instead, I will discuss the non-hit songs here. ""Over and Over"" is a terrific song that is the best of the non-singles. ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"" is a cover version of a song by disco group Rose Royce. I hate this song. Madonna, however, must like it more than I do, because she released it as a single 12 years later (it flopped). The rest of the songs, ""Shoo-Bee-Doo"", ""Pretender"" and ""Stay"" are okay songs that don't have much depth to them. This is really the album that made Madonna a superstar, but her singing and songwriting still had not fully developed at the time. The best was yet to come."
4,History in the making...,"Not one of my favourite Madonna albums, HOWEVER, it contains some absolute classics. (as would be expected - this is the album that truly introduced Madonna to the world and created the `Wannabes').As this is a remastered version of the original release of LAV, it does NOT include Into The Groove, which is a shame. However, most people who want it will have that on The Immaculate Collection.With 4 huge hits (Material Girl, Like a Virgin, Dress You Up and Angel) some classic Madonna album cuts, Over and Over (later to be remixed on You Can Dance), Stay and a cover of the Rose Royce classic `Love Don't Live Here Anymore' (which was remixed and released as a single many years later to support the `Something to Remember' ballads collection), and the truly beautiful (and still one of Madonna fans most loved ballads) Shoo-Bee-Doo.The remixes are good, essentially extended versions (as the 80's did best!)A classic and historical album!"
3,Average,"With LIKE A VIRGIN, Madonna dropped the producers from her first album and enlisted the help of Nile Rogers. The album spun a few hits, such as ""Material Girl"" and ""Like A Virgin"" which were important career songs for Madonna. However, the album isn't as good as her debut, and often falls short. It's simply too boring. Her remake of ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"" here in uninspired, however the newer version from SOMETHING TO REMEMBER definately improves on her original version of the song. There's definately some throwaway tracks like ""Over And Over"", ""Shoo-Bee-Doo"", but some good moments like ""Pretender"" and ""Stay"". Overall not really essential by any means unless you are a big fan that wants everything Madonna has put out."
5,pravooooooo Madonna,"Pravoooooooo, Maddona .... really I think Madonna is a great poet and a great singer , that attracted me from lucky star ( true blue, like a virgin , bed time story , erotica , ray of light ..) to beautiful stranger ... I love Madonna's songs , and as ( young poet ) I am saying it was my red-letter day to hear you saying that about(Like a Virgin) ...is one of madonna's surprises and I believe that she knows How to treat our physical needs( like a virgin) as well as our romantic desires ( something to remember ) in the name of music , Madonna is my best singer...Yours .."
5,Like A Virgin is incredible,"With songs like ""Dress You Up"" and ""Like A Virgin"" This has to be the greatest Madonna CD ever made.""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"" Made me realize that Madonna isn't just the happy singer I thought she was when I listened to the first 4 tracks. I think Madonna is the GREATEST female singer of all time!!!"
3,Was This a Means for Climbing up the Chart or Was This Really What She Was?,"Even knowing transformation is one of Madonna's characteristics and strengths, retrospectively, her second album Like A Virgin is perplexing: Was this just a means for climbing up the chart or was this really what she was? In cheesily deformed Chic-like disco tunes by producer Nile Rodgers, Madonna doesn't appear to be genuine. Still, there are moments we take a glimpse of bona fide Madonna--in her own love song ""Angel,"" for example, sparkling between exceedingly chart-aimed ""Material Girl"" and ""Like A Virgin."""
2,Horrible Plastic Pop,"In 1984, Madonna hooked up with the pop svengalis of the day, and made a completely plastic, materialistic, soulless album. And that album was misguidingly titled 'Like a Virgin,' after the excellent hit single that gives the album its two-star rating. Avoid this, or if you must have it, do what I did, and buy the cassette for $1 at a rummage sale. This album is nowhere near the caliber of Madonna's later work. Instead get her underrated debut album."
1,tin ear,"I purchased LIKE A VIRGIN, TRUE BLUE, and MADONNA CDs. These are the absolute worst remastered cds ever! They sound like your heads in a tin can. There's no MIDRANGE, BASS, or DEPTH. Sounds like a cheap transistor radio from 1960."
2,Borderline annoying,"This is my least favorite Madonna album. Despite the title track and ""Material Girl"", the rest of the songs are almost to the point of being annoying. This album showcases Madonna's limited vocal ability to sing in the high-octave range. Thank goodness her voice kept maturing throughout her next albums."
2,ONE OF THE WORSE RE-ISSUES OF THE 2012 MADONNA VINYL SERIES - LIKE A VIRGIN,"I saw all five re-issues in person and am peeved that the original prints weren't use to re-create these album images. Like a Prayer suffered the worst from this because the cover looks blurry and lifeless. I was most excited to get this one since ""Like A Prayer"" was the first album I purchased (back in 1989). This reissue also clearly didn't have any patchouli splashed on it.In second place, Like A Virgin doesn't have the same tint as the original cover and is much darker. The image on the back is also no longer flipped upside down but is now right side up which didn't keep with the original album lay-out.With that said, the best looking re-issues happen to be ""True Blue"" and ""Erotica."" Lastly, the ""Madonna"" album seems to have an improved cover due to the brightening of the image."
3,All Style No Substance,"Madonna's sophmore effort proved to be one of Madonna's most successful efforts. Selling over 10 million copies (second to The Immaculate Collection), this album actually proves to be her weakest. I just finished listening to it in it's entirety and honestly some songs are shameful. Of course, we have the classics but the other songs are 2nd rate fillers. Pretender, Shoo-Be-Do & Stay are disposible. The others are eighties must haves. For those songs alone this album is essential for any Madonna fan or retro 80's collector.As far as the content: it's mostly about relationships on superficial levels, nothing deep. Most definitely, Madonna's music has progressively matured through out the years and for that we should be thankful.For Madonna's best check out, Madonna (debut), The Immaculate Collection, Erotica, Ray of Light & Music."
3,not bad,"This Album was produced by Nile Rodgers and his time was the 70s. If we listen to this album today we may think there was no technical possibilty to create quality pop music, but believe me this recording sounded ""old"" by the time it came out. Other weakness is that it has many monotone and repeatative song, which are boring, example: over and over, pretender, stay...By that time she worked also together with Tangerine Dream, and those songs are much better than the ones we can find here, no wonder that ""Gambler"" and Crazy for You"" climbed the charts not theese ones. Her other big hit ""Into the groove"" is not presented here either."
2,not her best album,What is the big deal about this album? The only good songs are the ones that came out as singles.
5,Madonna-Like A Virgin,"Madonna's 2nd Album Like A Virgin,it is one of those Albums that you never stop playing,it never gets Old & you know every word in each song by Heart.Its Timeless. One of Madonna's Best ever"
4,Not her best...,"This is an ok cd but not my favorite from Madonna.The title trackand Material Girl are the best on this cd. If you like those songs get The Immaculate Collection, it has both of those songs plus her other hits."
2,VERY AVERAGE,Even Nile Rodgers The Producer calls This Disc Soggy.It Hasn't Aged Well.Sounding More Important for it's Time Period.Her VOice Lost what Little edge it had from the First Disc.The Title Cut was a Straight Bite Of Michael Jackson's Billie Jean.She Sounds Horrible on Rose Royces Love Don't Live here Anymore.Dress You Up&Material Girl were Essential to the 80's Style&Sound.but are Dated&Sound Empty Now.
2,"Catchy tunes yes, but musically bland overall","This would prove to be Madonna's breakthrough album. Furhtermore, there's no denying that this album produced successful singles such as the title track and ""Material Girl"". Unfortunately this album would also be indicative of the direction that Madonna would take with all of her subsequent releases to date. Catchy tunes with good hooks, yes, but in spite of this all of her music continues to be simplistic, sugar-coated repetitive pop. Nevermind the fact that her marginal talent as a singer requires extensive doctoring by the studio engineer."
3,Like A Star,"Released in late 1984, Madonna's Like A Virgin made the artist a megastar. Buoyed by the title track (and a racy performance of the song at the MTV Video Music Awards show), the album shot to the top of the charts of became one of the biggest selling albums ever by a female artist with 10 million in sales. The album produced four top ten singles. Even though the title track was the only to reach number one, ""Material Girl"" has become the most enduring and become an unwanted nickname for the singer. Channeling her inner Marilyn Monroe, the song has become a symbol of the excess of the 80's. It is undeniable catchy and try to get it out of your head after hearing it. Surprisingly it peaked at number two kept out of the top spot by REO Speedwagon and Phil Collins. ""Angel"" & ""Dress You Up"" both peaked at number five. Her cover of Rose Royce's ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"" is a superior song to the other two and could have been a big hit if it was released as a single."
3,Swing for the remaster,"This CD is good if you want to hear the songs the same way you did on your casette back in the 80's, but if you are looking to repurchase an old favorite swing for the remaster. It includes two remixes and sounds awesome."
1,don't waste your time,"I bought one of these for my zen micro. It doesn't work. The battery never gets charged over half full (as indicated on screen), and the charging icon does not disappear off the screen, however long you leave it. spend the extra money on the official creative version which works a lot better."
5,Great boot!,Awesome boot. This is my second pair. The first pair lasted over 3 years. I'll wear Rocky's the rest of my career.
1,Not what I ordered,"Another product ordered and I receive it in a damaged box and they are not steel-toed as I ordered.. I need steel-toed boots here and soft toes are not acceptable. Since it will cost me more time to fly into a base with a post office and send these back, i will use these as slippers and order boots from another site. If you are going to sell a product ensure you have an adequate Quality Cantrol/Quality assurance Dept."
4,Developing Letter-Sound Connections,I found this book to be very helpful to help my 4 year old son learn the alphabet. As a parent and teacher I needed a resource that clearly gave me ideas that I could use to teach letter-sound combinations and this has a format that is easy to follow and is filled with ideas for each letter of the alphabet. This is a must for parents and teachers.
1,small amount of glue and high price-available for less,"effective glue, easy to handle being a gel.small amount--no more than 6 small pea size drops in each tube. Half of the tube is filled with air. I bought 10 and they are all the same-half air.over priced on Amazon. i should have shopped around.available at idealtruevalue for $.39 each which is where I will buy more. It worked well for my glass to plastic application. I had a 100 pieces to glue and I thought 10 tubes would certainly be enough, but each tube did 2 if I was very careful with the amount."
3,Good for young adults,Good book for young people of middle school age as it does a nice overview of a true American hero. Little to no historical significance but could cause the child to look further into the American Revolution. The portion related to the French Revolution is terrible with no background to explain the story or cause further reading in that area. An adult would not be satisfied with this book.
3,DNA for Kids,"The book is written for YOUNG ADULTS in mind. DNA is simplified with cut-out models, colored pictures, diagrams. It is only 32 pages. Perfect book for explaining DNA to Young Adults. It is expensive but I could not find any other book to show DNA to young people and get their imagination going."
3,Haven't warn them yet but....,"I got these boots yesterday. The picture on this site, the bluff/buff color makes them look like they have a brown hue, but the bottom of the boots are definitely black, no biggie. Trying them on for the first time, the length is true to size, the width is a little over the top. Pretty wide (good for extra socks) and above the toe area there's like a 1+ inch of cavernous space. Maybe this is normal for snow boots? I think they'll keep my feet warm and will be easy to walk in, so even if they are black (with a tan upper) and don't hug my feet perfectly, they'll do the job."
1,RETURNED!,I returned this! I didn't even try to use it because it does not look feminine. It fits awkward... like my feet looks big and weird. I don't know what exactly is wrong but it just doesn't look nice to me. It's heavy too!
3,quality issue,"the product looks good from web and size fits my need, however the workmanship is not so good. issues i can see include 1) color lost along edges 2) screw holes are too deep and not very accurate, resulting non-flat surfaces and 90% of screw hole covers can not stay 3) can only set 2-unit set one way or the end without support will sink 4) the free 3-5 business shipping is the longest 3-5 day i ever seen unless here ""3-5 days"" means only the time amazon needs to process the order."
5,Another exceptional book from the United States Naval Institute,"As with ""Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway"", using both U.S. and Japanese sources of information makes the book more valid. While some important battles not fully covered, overall an exceptional book."
1,Swill,"This is one of many books claiming to be ""based on hitherto unreleased Japanese documents"" it purports to be told from the Japanese side which increases it's propaganda value but it's all so crudely done that only a U.S. Marine cadet and other mentally uncomplicated people could see it as anything but tiresome american chest beating.This book is just more sickly solipsism for the kind of grubby folks who hang around gun shows and keep fading foot-ball trophies on their mantelpiece.Just read the front cover flap and you can see how clichéd this garbage is.Incidentally the Japanese navy didn't somehow begin in 1941 it's just convenient for the double speak of Dull to begin there. Where's the Japanese defeat of Czarist Russia, or the absurdly biased quotas at the London & Washington naval conferences?"
5,Good statistics and findings,I forgot all about this book! I have to get it back from my sister. It arrived perfectly and in time for my interpersonal relationships class.
5,Organic Green Mountain Dark Roast,"Pricing for Green Mountain Whole Bean Coffees on Amazaon have become ridiculous. The third party sellers are all over the board. I have requested that Green Mountain Coffee Roasters have Amazon fulfill their orders direct and make them available for Amazon.com Prime ShippingA great product; full flavor dark roast. Excellent for espresso and cappuccino makers. Green Mountain is a high quality brand, best known for making the K-cups- This is a premium whole bean selection."
4,A brief introduction for children of stellar evolution.,"This is another book in Isaac Asimov's excellent ""Library of the Universe"" series that serves as a supplementary text for the introduction of astronomy for young children. This volume is filled with beautiful photographs of stars and discusses the life and ultimate fate of different types of stars. The book has been updated and revised by Francis Reddy in 1995 as ""Star Cycles: The Life and Death of Stars."" Asimov had passed away in 1992."
4,Solidly researched,"The author of this book, Hugh Trevor-Roper, embarrassed himself and sullied his reputation in 1983 when he was the only major historian to vouch for the accuracy of the fake ""Hitler diaries."" But in 1947, when he wrote this book, he was a younger, more cogent and wiser man.What makes this book interesting is that it is factual, diligently researched and Roper also relied upon dozens of interviews with Hitler's intimates. Trevor-Roper was methodical in his questioning, and he incorporates the recollections of Hitler's inner circle throughout the narrative.Though it's 50 years old, this book has stood up quite well and it's a mini classic in its genre."
4,Good for the Beginner,"This book had no real new insights or news, but would be good for someone who hasnt read alot about Hitler or the era. It covers somebasic events quite well, but it is all things told in every story about the war. So, if its your first look into the WW2 ordeal, I recommend it. However, if you have read or seen a few good documentarys about it, it will be review."
1,Afterwar Political Pamphlet,"I found this book useless in respect to history. I was looking for a historical documentary but found a political afterwar pamphlet full of anti-nazi propaganda. I read a few historical reviews, in my opinion this boock is full of lies. Specially taking in concern that this author discredited himself already a few times during his lifetime.He is an unreliable source, the Russians were the first to Berlin, he wasn't fluent in German (had to rely on translators), and his interviewed sources proved to be liars. That book who so many have relied on since it's publishing is best used as a door stop."
2,"Lot of info, but horrible to read, review","I got this book for my PC Technology Class, I've used it for 2 weeks, and I just hate this book. The thing that gets me mad the most is that its ALL OVER THE PLACE. They'll be talking about the BIOS, then go to expansion slots for like 3 pages, and then go back to Bios's again (pg 197-208). It's very confusing to follow, they should have sections, instead of cramming everything without header titles. The only good thing I like about it is that is has a lot of info, but if you have the time, and patience to find it, then this book is probably OK for you."
5,Good book For Hardware Support,"Great book, easy to understand a little bit expensive but its worth it"
4,Just In Time,"Taking a computer class one night a week is more than enough for any average person w/ a full-time job. After the registration, the school location and the reality of how much books cost new these days. Amazon came through for me a week before class and this was after tracking all the various campuses and tips from friends. Buying the book used same me easily $30 to $40. The is in great condition, you would of thought it was new."
5,"Fun, fast, easy","This is a fun little truck that goes together quickly and easily. With a houseful of little boys, I sometimes think we should look into professional durability testing, but this has lasted well. Its hard to tell who likes it more, the little ones or the daddy. Makes a great inexpensive gift."
1,False advertising with misleading photo,"I'd actually like to give it zero stars. The photo makes this product look like a decent sized truck when in fact it's a fraction of the size. Excellent example of false advertising. I guess the ""1/32"" was the clue that this was NOT in fact a full-sized toy. I recommend you stay away or the recipient will be disappointed, as mine was. I will no longer be buying toys via this method."
4,Gross cover and not much about what i expected!,"Ok this book isn't soo good! it does tell you about the goddess but not the info i really needed. it is great in magickal workings but to me not much in goddess warship! i've studied the craft at age 8 and i'm only 11. it's great for people intrested in magick but bad for people intrested in goddesses. If you wanna buy a book on goddesses buy this book called The Maiden, Mother, And the Crone.(i think i spelled the title right! but i might have been wrong! or close to the title)"
2,Not really even worth the $1 I paid for it at a garage sale...,"I have to agree with the other 2-star reviewer--this video is corny and outdated. There are some interesting parts and pretty pictures, but most of it is pure speculation (the hypothetical Oort cloud and SETI, to give two examples) and rather melodramatic. I'm sure there are better space videos/DVDs out there. Guess I'll keep looking!"
2,Did I miss something!?,"I don't know what planet the other reviewers are on but it's certainly not this one. I waited months in anticipation for this 'rave-review-video' but it is so cheesy! Factually it is OK but the graphics and whole flow of the documentary are 50 years out of date. I was really, really disappointed especially since it had my hero from Startrek narrating it. Primary School astronomy classes might appreciate it but not grown adults with real money to spend on much more worthy videos."
2,Only one song worth while,"There was only one song on the entire album that was worth listening to. If you do not know which one I mean, buy the album. Maybe you will like it."
4,Thief in Retreat,I'm glad I was able to read Bad Faith first because I felt very comfortable reading this and I enjoyed it as much as the first book.
1,vagans pleasure,"My review is simple and to the point. On page 119 the recipe calls for very simple ingredients but the whole mess would not stick together so I had to add an egg. The meal was good but bieng a vegetarian,I did not like to eat an egg. I really like the book except for a few adjustments that had to be made to some of the recipes. Keep up the good work and thank you for listening to my complaints. P.Liberet"
1,AWFUL,I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH THIS MOVIE BEFORE IT WENT INTO THE HAPPY TRASH. AS A MATTER OF FACT THE ACTING ALONE IS ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU HEAVE YOUR COOKIES. I WATCH ALOT OF INDIE FLICKS THIS ONE WINS THE PRIZE FOR WORST OF THE YEAR IF IT WON ANY AWARDS IT WAS FOR WORST FILM OF THE YEAR
4,Cool indie horror flick,"I prefer my horror flicks indie style. Get too big budget on one of these and it starts to feel convoluted. Anyway, I dug this. I've got a huge horror collection and I will rewatch this with my buds."
4,FAVORITE of THE series,"i was really surprised . between the stock news reel footage , the engaging story and characters and the graphic brutality depicted onscreen , i was really pleased and gratified with RAMBO . stallone did an excellent job . i enjoyed his last ROCKY picture almost as much . SLY knows what the people want . the critics (by and large) missed the launch on this one . it's a BLAST . at 60 , the man's delivering what most of the action/adventure directors , writers and producers are green with . ENVY . out-damn-standing ."
3,Graphics could be wayy better..,"Acting was cheap, the graphics were cheap.... Not much else was going on but the explosions were great. Not his best comeback."
4,"its bloody, gorey, and has lots of guns and huge explosions, thats why i like it","Im a person who like to see explosions and gunfights. so for me this movie delivered. when you watch this movie know that its not for the squemish, in this movie you'll see people shredded by bullets and limbs shot off, etc. but overall i enjoyed this movie."
2,"Live for nothing, die for the teak","Last time I looked, the Karen and other heavily armed national minorities in Burma had a deal with the evil SLORC dictators about splitting the proceeds from smuggling. I think it was fifty-fifty.Why didn't Rambo just tell the Karen to call the Burmese army, hand over some teak wood, and save the day?As usual, Johnny has no reality check when it comes to world politics (although he's good as an archer). I mean, last time he aided al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan!Live for nothing and...die for nothing.What a guy."
3,Gunky goo disk,I dont know what was caked on the disk when i got it almost like dried soda or food or who knows what. Used some disk safe cleaner first and a microfiber cloth on it and it took a little. It to get it off. Some scratches on it. Skips in couple of places
2,"Stallone's intentions were good, but unsatisfing.","It is true that this movie had tons of action throughout every second of the movie, but was completely overdone. The storyline was completely boring and Stallone's role in the movie was not a major one since the mission was only to save the damsel in distress; too cliche. I don't know if anyone else noticed but in all of the other Stallone movies he showed how tough he was like all other tough guys like Arnold and the Rock by having their shirt rip throughout the movie revealing their six pack, but in this movie, i don't know but maybe Stallone was embarrassed to show anything but his arms and face....getting too old....yup."
2,Rambo gone wrong!!,"Was so very disappointed. No real plot, Stallone was a bit overweight and not built as in his first and never took shirt off and just looked bedraggled. Was not something I would recommend to anyone!!!"
2,Parody for Pyros,"In a parody of the movies on the old West, Sylvester Stallone brings back a 1980s franchise character in a blow-'em-up bash based on the Thailand-Burma border.Rambo is the quintessential modern gunslinger, misunderstood by those who do not know him, but appreciated by the few he rescues from perilous situations. And this tough guy has little to say to the bad guys, since his actions speak louder than words.But with explosions being featured throughout Rambo's rescue mission, what potentially could have been Hang 'em High in southeast Asia becomes a huge fireworks display gone ridiculously awry."
2,Lots of bloody action. Ninety nine percent of them has been filmed before.,"This movie contains lots of bloody action. The trouble is ninety nine percent of them has been filmed before. I prefer ""Black Hawk down"" and""American soldiers - A day in Iraq"". They're more suspenseful, and realistic"
1,Unbelievable horrific!,"Worst, most graphic, twisted, bloody, sexually perverse piece of GARBAGE I've ever subjected my poor eyeballs to. My brain needs a good washing after this. How is this supposed to be entertainment?"
5,"""Rambo"" Comes Full Circle","Great movie with a lot of action...Very realistic...Rambo is not a superhero..just very Human...and that's a good point with this Movie. The End is ""Blood and Tears""...a must see !"
3,"If you're squeamish, be prepared","I'll make this short and sweet. I enjoy a movie where the good guys win. With this newest Rambo movie, there is alot to get through to get to the good guys winning part. In the realm of realistic gore, Saving Private Ryan is a picnic compared to this movie. I had my hands over my face for much of the movie. I don't need to see someone eviscerated, head blown off, limbs severed, bodies turned into red mist, to know that someone got killed. I argued with my 16 year old son about this because he thinks I'm a wimp. I think he has been desensitized via realistic video games depicting blood and gore. I prefer less blood and more substance."
5,Just what you'd expect from a rambo film- Great Action!,"First off, dont go into this movie thinking that theres some amazing story line or anything like that,i mean come on- its Rambo. Its all about the action and the thrill of the ride-- not about BORING character development and plot twists. Its funny seeing the critics trash it, simply becouse they were expecting...well, who knows the Godfather or something. I mean, they want the action watered down in favour of a better story line, but when you start screwing with simple mechanics that make up what is 'Rambo', it then becomes something else entirely. If you want a great blood and guts action film, you've come to the right place."
4,Too Violent But a Good Action Movie!,"A movie about the war crimes in Burma where a group of peace advocates travel there but get caught by the brutal army.John Rambo tries to rescue them, and of course is able to defeat the whole army.Great Action. Really well direct. However very violent.The violence looks so real and is so graphic that will disgust you. You might need to watch the movie in 3 phases since watching it one shot could make you throw up."
5,Bloodiest movie of all time!!!,"If you were wondering how much carnage it was possible to inflict in an hour and a half and how horrifying realistic one could make said carnage, then your answer is simple: RAMBO!!The Burmese Military Junta, not as notorious as China for oppressing Buddhist but in twice as nasty in their oppression, comes face to face with the unoppressable, and his name is RAMBO!!!!A bunch of Christian aid workers go into a warzone and it's up to Rambo to save there hides and kick the living hell out of the Burmese military. The Washington State national guard couldn't handle him in First Blood, the Vietnamese and Russian military couldn't control him in Rambo: First Blood Part II, the Soviet Union couldn't take it anymore from him and had to quit Afghanistan because of Rambo III and now, the Burmese Military Junta feels the wrath, of John Rambo!!!"
2,Waste,"I am a Rambo fanatic so I wanted to make sure I had ALL scenes from the new movie. After having already bought the DVD I bought this to have it all. What did they do? They cut out scenes to make room for the new ones. This really bad editing of some of the violence and language to make room for the new scenes. Now, to see the whole movie you have to watch both the DVD and the Blu ray. Not all in one place, man did I get screwed. Don't give them any more money."
3,Exactly what you think it will be,"Things exploding. Baddies getting shot at. The moaning asshat that turns into a hero - all the usual stuff ideal for killing off a plane ride. If there was a plot twist then I missed it. All in all, 3 bucks gets you 90 or so minutes of brain dead shoot 'em up."
3,RAMBO Digital copy DOA,"The digital copy comes back as an out of date code when you try to install it. I'm working with Lionsgate, the producer, to correct this, but so far, no luck."
2,One of the most violent movies ever!!,"I was impresses.... After Rocky Balboa,a movie almost mellow, then Sly produces Rambo IV, one of the most violent movies EVER! Heads split open all the time, knives are plunged into bodies all the time... and the plot begin with a humanitarian mission... Pretty blunt irony...Well, at least this was made the old way: almost no blue or over the top CGI...I just wonder what David Morrell thinks about Sly anda Hollywood did to John Rambo (other than being happy for getiting more dollars from his creation)."
3,"""Apocalypse Now"" Meets ""The Wild Bunch""","""Rambo"" (2008) makes Sam Peckinpah look like Walt Disney. This Sylvester Stallone bloodfest exists in its own cinematic universe - functioning as a graphic journey into Burmese carnage. At least Stallone keeps things moving while bullets, bombs and bodies fly in all directions. The 90-minute running time adds to the B-movie atmosphere. Thanks for the memories, Sly, but enough already."
3,RAMBO,"Definitely much better than the third installment, the most violent of the four. Rambo got older and gain weight a little but still knows how to fight. The blu ray transfer is pretty good, both video & audio, paying extra for it sure worth it."
5,ACTION!,"You can't beat this movie for a pure action ride. We'll have fun, fun, fun til Daddy takes the guns away."
4,How to bake a brutality cake.,"This latest tale of John Rambo is sticky sweet gore candy. It seems that Sly woke up one day and decided it was time for a carnival of violence that wold make Verhoeven stand up salute. Easily 60% of this movie an a homage to carnage, a shining temple to trauma with our man Rambo getting gnarly on waves of blood normally reserved for only the most hemorrhage happy anime.Sure sure, there is a message floundering at the bottom of this Mariana's Trench of brutality. It amounts to this; don't go to Burma. Especially if your an unarmed group of idealistic white folk from Colorado. Outside of that handy little moral, the undercurrent of this unabashed slaughter riot is how to make a film into a veritable vessel of viscera.There are zero pulled punches in this tale of a horrid civil war. Men, women and children are killed, maimed, beaten, raped, tortured and eaten. Not in a ""suggestive"" sense either.Rent. Enjoy. Keep all children under 23 and females out of the room."
4,Immensely Satisfying,"Rambo IV was immensely satisfying. The movie sets you up with the real atrocities committed by the Burmese Army against the Karen people (rape, murder, mutilation, burning, and worse) and then adds the trials of the fictional Christian missionaries that Rambo ferried upriver. By the time Rambo comes back to save the day, you are more than ready to see masses of Burmese soldiers shot up. Some critics called this ""blood porn,"" but, as Stallone pointed out, the movie actually toned down the violence of real life in Burma. If only Rambo did exist to bring justice to all the people oppressed by the Burmese military dictatorship."
4,Raw Intertainment,"Now if you are hoping to see some fact based use of weaponry and war situations on the scale of Saving Private Ryan you may not like this flick. But if you want to see some intensley violent acts on human beings and what a 50 caliber machine gun can do to someone this movie is for you. It also brings to fore the horrible situation in Burma and how innocent villagers are slaughtered and massacred by the ruling army that also forcefully recruits young boys who must join or be slaughtered as well. This is ocurring in parts of Africa as well with the diamond trade and other European exploits. You have ample reason to not mind seeing the 'bad guys' take it hard from Rambo. The acting is as expected for any Stallone film, good enough to support the action and injected with some semblance of some good will message. Probably not the film to watch with your 12 your old due to the intense blood shed."
3,Rambo,"This is typical Rambo fare, with a lot of stares,little meaningful dialogue, but a lot of action with a high body count. Once again, the blu-ray picture and sound are very good. Rambo has aged, but the stories are the same."
5,A bunch of idiots...,"Yeah anyone who gives this a bad review for the effects and violence is a moron, its that simple...if you dont know anything about effects and have no sort of experience in the field...then do us all a favor and shut the hell up.thanks"
3,A symphony of destruction and death,"Well, if you arent into violence, you better pass on this one. This movie should have been called ""How Many People Can Be Killed in Two Hours?"". Dont get me wrong, I thought it was pretty good and I was most definately entertained. But, I am curious where the Hollywood hypocrites were on this movie? You know, the ones that called Mel Gibsons Apocalypto a piece of crap because of all the ridiculous violence. Oh wait, I guess Sly Stallone isnt in the Hollywood dog house like Mel is, is he? This movie makes Mel's look like Sesame Street. So much of objectivity."
3,Better Than Expected,Stallone revives his second most famous character and creates a very effective war action movie. The violence is extreme but as Sly explains in his very thoughtful commentary-he was just trying to show the reality of the atrocities in Burma.
1,Rambo - Review on Fulfillment by Canada Inc. Not Movie Itself,I bought this DVD at the end of last year (2011) and my boyfriend just tried watching it today. Brand-new out of the packaging - as he tried to get it out - the DVD broke. Never had this happen before. Unfortunately it's been too long a period of time from the time we bought it until now to return it. Just be careful who's fulfilling your order for you. Perhaps not this company's fault - but perhaps it is.
2,another 'sly' movie,"Typical sly action movie. Quite funny the way rambo tries to be all philosophical. No great message no great action. Rambo as usual kills hundreds single handedly. If you have couple of hours to kill and nothing else is on tv, rent it."
2,"racism, hypocritical and self-righteous","This is a terrible show and does not deserve more than 2 stars.The plot is awfully simple: a bunch of self-righteous white guys went to save war ridden little Asia. Of course, they got caught up in the war and Rambo came to rescue with bunch of self-righteous white mercs. Hmm, if you are god-believing church person coming for ""humanitarian"" work, why did you hire bunch of mercs to do the killing? Why not let God take care of the humanitarian's fate? How hypocritical!Of course, the evil Asian guy must not rape the poor white girl until Rambo stood behind him. Give me freaking break!There's no character building, no plot, no interaction/connection between characters, nothing but people being blown into pieces."
1,Embarrassingly bad,"I should have known better than to rent this and expect it to be anywhere near the original First Blood and Rambo films. Those were made when Stallone was at his peak. Here, he's just pathetic. The acting is horrid, the plot is pointless. Save yourself the trouble and rent the originals. This HAD to have been made as a money-raiser. How far the mighty have fallen."
3,Digital disappointment,I was very excited to see it came with a digital copy but it did not work. That was a big reason for getting it.
2,Rambo (special edition+digital copy),I have been unable to play the digital copy as it requires me to give my state in USA!!!!I am in Africa. The special edition CD is only one movie!!!! what is special???
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I started to watch this movie with low expectations..But it was a lot better than I thought it was going to be...If you haven't seen it yet, it's worth a viewing."
5,Sweet,"Besides the movie being good, the Blu-Ray quality is awesome. No better way to watch Rambo in action"
3,After 20 years the fire still burns,"Living hand to mouth in south East Asia John Rambodoesn't want to get mixed up in the civil war in Burma.A beautiful Christian missionary changes all that.Can one old guy make a difference against just anotherset of military bad guys who live off killing and stealing from their own people? In many cases the US Government has given uniforms, weapons andtanks to just this sort of people in the name of regional stability.US tax dollars at work in the world, you ask?In another daring raid into enemy territory...the end is pretty predictable. In a time of another unpopular warRambo is back, because people need heroes."
5,great movie,I'm not usually into a lot of action movies. But because of my hubby I do watch them and enjoy them. My husband is a big fan of Rambo. He can watch Rambo movies all day. When he was a kid he use to dress up and fight like Rambo. For awhile Rambo was the name people gave him. Now as an adult he still wishes he was Rambo. He buys knifes and calls it his Rambo knifes.... lol. He plays paintball and tells everyone he is Rambo.... lol.
4,A good addition to my Collection,I enjoyed seeing this Blu-ray version of Rambo. A full 7.1 sound encoding makes it even better to have as one more Rambo collection.
3,It's nice to see somebody take on the Burmese army,"After following the situation in Burma for years, it sure was nice to see somebody take on the Burmese army! Unlike the past movies, this one isn't exactly Rambo versus a huge army - he has help from some mercenaries. Still, they manage to do a good deal of damage. If only they could do that in real life. This is really the only movie sinceBeyond Rangoonthat features Burma, so it's a must-see for anyone interested in the country.This is definitely the best Rambo film sinceFirst Blood. However, it doesn't really have any character development or raw emotional value - just lots of shooting and violence. Of course, that's what a Rambo movie is based on. Nonetheless, the lack of a deep emotional connection to the movie (of the type inFirst Blood) means this film only gets three stars. After seeing it once, it doesn't really have much replay value."
5,The BEST Rambo YET,"BLOOD AND GUTS, dont let your kids watch this movie is all I can say. this was an AWSOME flick. Sylvester didnt do much but stand on the back of a m50 cal. and mess stuff up. but the Graphics are mezzmerizing. the plot was AOK."
5,A Bloodbath of Epic Proportions!!!!,"First Blood is still the best and my personal favorite in the rambo series, but Stallone despite his age has managed to pull off another successful revival of one of his iconic characters. Rambo II and III may have been over the top one man army action movies, but that is not the case here. Stallone puts Rambo into an ongoing real world crisis in Burma with a group of mercs trying to rescue a group of people from a terrible fate in a place of despair. If you liked any or all of previous rambo movies, you'll like this one, if your looking for a realistically good action movie, you'll like this one, if your looking for a very bloody and violent action movie, then you'll definitely like this one!!!"
4,Surprisingly Good,"The movie itself is immensely entertaining if you are an action fan (even a jaded one). Stallone successfully builds tension and the action scenes, when they come, are brutally effective. This is easily the most graphically violent of the Rambo franchise but in that sense it is reflective of its times. My favorite episode of the franchise."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This movie is horrible. It has no point. It is so gory and graphic that it's almost laughable. After you see the 20th guy get his head blown off in shaky slo-mo, you're like, ok whatever. They could have done so much with this character but instead chose to create a ridiculous storyline with no purpose whatsoever. We wasted $15 on this movie to complete the set. It was better without it!"
1,more baloney macho fake adulthood,"Did you see any of the previous Rambos which were specifically made to make U.S. citizens think that the Vietnamese majority were somehow...ugly, terrorist, maniacs (defending their soil) while the the US Armed Forces really were like one bigger than life humanoid, so cartoonish you have to laugh along with the machine-man. Well, if you could swallow that stuff with a straight face then you probably fit with the other positive reviews here. If you expect something more than foolish caricatures and superficial cardboard cut-outs you'll be sorry you wasted any time, money or energy on Mr. Stallone and the infantile script he mechanically acts out.Sheesh -- with all the talent and brains out there the studios push this junk."
1,rambo,"i have to say that this film did more in picturing realistic slaughter, than any of the current news links. that said, the film tends to reinforce old stereotypes of noble westerners trying to save the helpless, godless heathens, who lack basic humanity and civilization. the movie also shows the old image of a perverted asian male who lusts after the blond,unattainable white woman. but no need to fear...rambo rescues her before she's dishonored. just as our cavalery once did for american indian-captured white women in the old west. in view of today's globalism and the closeness of other cultures through the travel, media, and immigration, these are dangerous ideas to perpetuate."
1,DONT BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i bought wideScreen edition but guess what happend when i got the package ??? it was widescreen from outside only !! but when you play the DVD you see FULL SCREEN !!! for plaxma and LCD guys i think you know what is the difference between full and wide SCREEN !! the movie is GReat !! but the seller is Crazy !!! SELLER NAME IS (((<< pierreda >>)))
1,Man this was bad....,"IF you like movies with lots and lots of scenes of people getting shot in half and heads and arms blown off and extremely close up shots of blood guts and gore then you'll like this movie.OR if you liked the original First blood with the smart Rambo and intelligent plot with action then you'll hate this.The movie is supposed to deal with the subject of genocide. It deals with the subject by showing you scene after scene after scene after scene of people being butchered with very video game style special effects.Of your a fan of David Morrell's character, you'll hate this movie. This movie has nothing to do with him."
3,blood and guts,"I was looking forward to something with even a hint of substance but was disspointed. This was almost a total waste of film. NOTHING but killing, dismemberment, exploding bodies and very little dialogue. This was nothing but 90 minutes of education on how to kill and mutilate the human body. If you like that then you will love this movie. I thought it was a waste of time. And there's going to be another? I am, by the way, a fan of the first three."
3,Another Rambo go? What would Bo Gritz think?,"Yea! My first Blu-ray review. Time to stepinto the 21st Century, I guess! The ninthattempt to relive the Bo Gritz-return forP.O.Ws story, just in time to rake in thebig bucks for a still in VERRRRYYY goodshape Sly Stallone. Can't wait for Rocky7 or Rambo 5? Neither can I. Well, at leastit's not by Golan Globus!"
2,Gratuitous Gore,"Yeah, it's a war film, so killing, blood and rape are to be expected. In this film, don't expect much more than that. It's extremely graphic without much more to fall back on. The setup is simplistic--missionaries want to do the right thing by bringing aid to those oppressed by the Burmese Army, and nothing about it goes well.Everything about this film is an effort to exhibit the most gross aspects of battle, with almost no character development, minimal context, no chemistry amongst the cast. Even the action can't stand without a blood bath. The only other notable facet of this film is trying to figure out what cosmetic surgery Stallone has done. The irony of missionaries vs murderous rampages is more than a bit blunt."
2,Rambo,"While the movie kept my interest, the language was so terrible and somewhat ridiculous. How many times do you need to hear one person saying the f*** word over and over and over. The violence was a over the top as well. I enjoy a good violent movie but this was extreme and became a turn off. I have enjoyed most, but not all of Stallone's movies, this is one I would say 'Pass.' Stallone directed this movie and I believe it shows that he is about finished with making good movies. My advice: Don't waste your time on this one."
4,John Rambo!!,"This extended cut is awesome, adding more depth and character than the theatrical version. The additional scenes are much needed, as you get more insight into Rambo's character, plus his awesome speech about war and ""who really wins."""
5,Just what I wanted,I thought I liked the third one the best until I saw this one. There is very real action and the gorey stuff is very believable!
4,Awesome movie - hohum quality,"I love this movie. During a time when Hollywood's A list actors would rather make pinko political statements, Stallone blesses us with a movie that's more than a mere throwback to 80's style action. Rambo is a statement that half our country has failed to realize ... there are people out there who do not respond to negotiation and appeasement. There is a time when a man must take matters into his own hands and kill to protect himself and the innocent. Duh!This was my first blu ray purchase that I watched from my PS3 on my 1080p 47 "" LCD TV. The added level of detail is noticeable, especially the distant shots where people's faces are normally blurry. However, this particular movie has too much variation in film grain from shot to shot that can be distracting."
4,Rambo 4 - Back to his best,"Let's be honest Stallone's last outing (Rambo 3) as the all-action hero was below par, I did enjoy it but no-where as much as Rambo 1 or 2. So onto Rambo 4.Rambo 4 is set in Burma, it's a very good movie with a LOT of graphic violence. Anyone who is familiar with the franchise should know what to expect but in this one the graphic violence is upped and each slaying of the bad guys results in a blood splattering unseen in any previous Rambo movies. Not to say it's not welcome though! The movie benefits from this, I think.I didn't go into this film with high expectations due to the lackluster number 3 in this franchise but i'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised. If you liked Rambo 1+2 you should like this installment.Rambo is back!"
4,Rambo continues,"Lots of action, thought it was cool that Stallone chose Burma as his action site to bring awareness to the atrocities that they have suffered and that present day still exists."
3,Bloody Good Fun!,"Sylvester Stallone doesn't sugarcoat the violence in this belated ""Rambo"" reprise. A bit slow going at first, but once Sly shoots those explosive arrows, the fun really begins. Richard Crenna is sadly missed."
3,"Some good, some bad","There are actually about 10 tracks, not the four listed! Those are just the artist names. About half of the tracks are good hard core drum n bass, although some of the Amen breaks have been played out to death. The other half are random phone conversations that are totally not interesting, and then a bunch of teutonic armagedon-space alien ranting at the end which is really corny."
3,Jarhead,"Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other BattlesExtensive narration, but ultimately boring."
4,First record I ever bought,"...there is a bit of sterility in here. The arrangements sound as if a person did them himself in his garage. Many of the lyrics (espeically the newer ones) are rather silly, and some of the simple plunkity-plunk tunes are pretty slight.Yet it still is a delightful record. There are several knockout songs in the newer stuff (Birthday Lady, Love Will Stone You), and after being unheard by me for over two decades, much of ""Emitt Rhodes"" is indeed, as fresh as a daisy. If you liked it back then, you'll probably like it now. And this collection is a winner, the indiviudual CDs are hard to get and quite pricey. This is a bargain."
2,Spoiled by Subtitle Clutter,"THE APARTMENT is a story whose complicated structure requires all of the viewer's concentration. If you are not competent in French, be prepared to have a hard time following the plot which consists of several flashbacks. The subtitles are of little value. Some of them are downright annoying; for example, ""Sound of water pattering,"" and ""car engine starts.""I plan to get the story and read it because I feel that somehow this film did not do it justice."
4,A masterpiece that was the basis for disaster...,"L'Appartment is truly a French movie worth watching and one of those films that should never have been remade made into an ""English"" equivalent.The acting from the principle characters are superb (Bohringer, Cassel, and Bellucci). I will agree with the others of the Hitchcock-esque, it's one of those movies where you should pay attention so as not to miss the most minute detail.I'm not able to comment on the DVD quality since I've got a bootleg. :o)As for it's American counterpart, Wicker Park, treat it like the plague and watch the original version because Harnett is no Cassel, by any stretch of imagination."
1,Episodes On This DVD Set Appear on Other Classic TV Western DVD Sets,"The episodes on this classic TV western DVD set can be found in the other DVD box sets asUltimate TV Westerns - 150 EpisodesWestern TV Classics 150 EpisodesClassic TV Westerns 300 EpisodesThis last one is a combination of the above two.The problem with the product descriptions on Amazon.com is that they do not give you a list of the episodes that appear on thes DVD sets. As a result, you can unknowningly order and get DVD sets that have the exact same episodes that you already have on the other DVD sets that you may have ordered before.I highly recommend that you skip this DVD set and order theClassic TV Westerns 300 Episodesif you have not yet ordered or gotten any of the above mentioned ones. Aong with this, you may also want to consider ordering or gettingEssential TV Western 150 Episodes.Forget about this DVD set."
2,Koontz Fans Will Be Disapointed,"I am a Dean Koontz fan and I have to say that this movie is one of the bad translations of his work. If you are not a fan of the book then by all means tell us what you think. I cann't be that objective because I am. So, if you haven't read the book, watch it. If you have read it, you will be disappointed. How does that saying go? It's never as good as the book."
3,SEND IN THE CLONE,"MR. MURDER is an okay adaptation of Koontz's novel. It's biggest fault is actually the casting of Stephen Baldwin in the all important leading role. Baldwin's range is extremely limited, and sometimes there was little difference between the real writer and the clone. This is especially true in the first half of the movie; later on, he tries a little harder and he salvages what little he can of his performance. Other than that, there are some interesting suspenseful moments; Julie Warner tries hard as Baldwin's wife, but she has to overcome a lot of inadequacy from Baldwin; James Coburn is wasted but the pro he is, he puts more into his smaller role than Baldwin did. Thomas Haden Church was awful. Monotone, boring, he came off even worse than Baldwin!!!The movie has some suspenseful moments, but it's not as good as the book. However, overall, it's fairly entertaining and not as awful as some may think."
1,It's pretty awful.,"Stephen Baldwin is a horror writer who discovers he has an identical, murderous clone. This silly Dean Koontz adaptation is based off of his equally silly novel, so it's no surprise the script has all the typical Koontz plot elements: Government conspiracy, heroes going on the run, and a final fight in the middle of nowhere. The only difference is that the mystery is revealed at the beginning! Overlong miniseries (Which actually features nudity in the video version)features countless leapholes in logic, unconvincing special effects, and a hilariously wooden Stephen Baldwin as the writer and killer. You can count the number of good Koontz novels and movies on one hand (Phantoms, anyone?), and this sure as hell isn't one of them."
2,False advertisement,"I researched this item for weeks before buying it. The advertisement said ""25 KW Generac Generator with Transfer switch, $7999.00. I ordered it and when it arrived it was leaking oil from the bottom, the container box was damaged, and there was no transfer switch included. When I refused to accept this item and call Amazon, I told the rep there was no Transfer Switch included. I was told the Advertisement I order this item was a mistake. The Transfer swith is ""Not"" included. I had to buy the transfer switch separate. I will not purchase anything else from Amazon.com."
2,Boring!,"What a disappointment. After a great erotic novel like theLady's Tutor to see this flat effort is really disappointing!Idon't find Michel sexy--he is a whore for god's sakes and not my ideaof a fantasy! And the spinster heroine is a bit annoying. And there was way too much morbidity and darkness abounding to sate my fantasy quotient--it was all very distracting, boring and unerotic. ( )"
4,Add this one to your Robin Schone collection ...I did!,"'THE LOVER' is another novel in my newly budding Robin Schone collection, I'm pleased to say. The erotic storyline is intertwined with dark undertones and suspense that made my skin crawl ...literally. It's a real page-turner and worth the read!"
1,Don't read this book for the plot.,"I don't know why this book has been rated so highly. While I agree that the book is somewhat titillating, the writing style is AWFUL!The author keeps repeating lines over and over again for shock value or whatever reason but this starts to irritate.There is just a sense of the whole story being written just for sex and if that is what the reader is looking for then just scan through the book for the sex parts. The plot is flimsy, the characters one-dimensional, the villain so evil that it's unrealistic and the dialogue silly. Buy a used copy instead (...)"
4,Excellent erotic romance ...,"Well ... after reading the other reviews, I searched my own recommendation to see if I had overrated The Lover. I think it was great~ There was most definitely a plot--and the veiled threats kept me guessing until near the end of the book as to what Michel/Michael's past might hold. I also really liked the character of Anne Aimes -- she was nobody's fool and certainly not a simpering ninny. I loved her bold, yet shy attitude. I love the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton and I thought the character of Michel/Michael was a bit of a take-off on Asher in the Anita Blake novels -- he speaks french in bed (now there's something I'd like to experience in my lifetime) and Michel also has scars, though not as extreme as Asher's. I would certainly recommend this book. I checked it out from the library and bought it AND Gabriel's Woman (a sequel) on amazon.com the next day (if I'm willing to pay cold, hard cash it must be good ;+) Definitely a keeper for me..."
2,Disappointing - Overpriced,"Compared to The Lady's Tutor (which I LOVED), this story has no depth. I'm all for pushing the boundaries in fiction, but there just wasn't enough of an emotional connection between the H/H to make me believe they had fallen in love by the end of the story. I will definitely try Robin's next book, because I was so impressed by TLT, but I may wait to get it at the used book store."
3,Not a Typical Romance,"This is not your typical romance. I don't know what to say except it does have it's moments. I like erotica, but I don't know yet if particularly like Robin Schone. There is just someing about her writing style that leaves me a little cold.Unless I really hate a book. I am not a reviewer who tells one not to read. I say...read for yourself. If you like it then cool. If you don't then I understand.RS is a different kind of author. There is a lot of pain in her reading. Beware!!! It is not your typical romance, if you would actually class this in the genre of romance at all. Whatever your flavor, this is a wierd read. Don't be suprised if when the hero or heroine doesn't conform."
2,Not what I'd hoped.,"This is not MY LADY'S TUTOR. It doesn't have nearly the polish or stylishness I adored about MLT. It doesn't have much of anything, and I found the tale of what Michael endured as a child gross."
2,Gross,"Wow, sums it up in one word. half romance half horror novel, it might've worked if the writer mixed them equally. the 1st half of the book is smokin' hot, full of sex. The 2nd half is puzzling and quickly deteriorates into a stephen king novel - not the best setting for a romance. I don't want to spoil the whole plot for people who haven't read the book: But If you knew a crazed stalker was following you and would bodily harm you & whoever you were with, wouldn't you limit contact with others or at least warn your lover????"
3,Banana splits and acrobatic tantra amidst misery and death,"Not exactly what I would call erotic. Sure, give me a good hot erotic romance, but put in lots of oblique, cryptic mumbo jumbo about fire, death, earthworms, The Man, and other things normally found in a Freudian melodrama and I tune out.No matter how many bananas got crushed or how many ping pong balls Michel stuff down his pants.Really, amidst so much misery and pain, it is hard for me to feel much for the couple. And when things are written in confusing prose and the characters as distant as Alpha Centauri, ""The Lover"" ends up more of ""The Headache"" than anything orgasmic."
1,"My gosh, are women this desperate for erotica???","I mistakenly bought 4 of Robin Schone's novels. I should know enough by now to try one first to see if I like it. Robin Schone is in my opinion, the worst writer I have ever read. I understand fantasy, but to use a male prostitute as a hero??? Reality just hits me in the face here. I worked in San Francisco around real male prostitutes and let me tell you it is not a romantic or sexy picture. As for the 30 something spinster as heroine, I just hate it. Why can't a writer use experienced female characters. Most of us have had sex. Why have the male characters had 100's of sex partners, but the women none? These novels are just sad and not at all erotic for me. Can't anyone just write a really good romance novel with realistic explicit sex scenes?"
1,wanting more,I enjoyed this story very much and now can't wait to get my hands on some of her other books. This one even helped me brush up on some of my French.
4,Mortifying,"I bought this book at the local bookstore, stuck it under my arm, walked all around the store with it and finally bought it and walked out with it, thinking it was a romance novel. I read two pages of it at home and I realized I had paraded all over the store with ""PORNOGRAPHY"" snuggled in my arms! I was mortified! (Also electrified - I then read it cover to cover in one sitting...)What a joke on me! My reputation will never be the same - but now I'm at Amazon, searching for everything else she's ever written...and I'll take it home in a plain brown wrapper, hee hee. The writing is very similar to Anne Rice's erotica. I wish, however, that the book had been fleshed out a little more - Ms. Schone gives us teasing glimpses of ""the rest of the story""...I want to know what Anne thought as she watched him dance at her come-out. I want to know about all his other lovers. I want to know about Michel's education in the brothel. I want more!"
1,A nice doorstop and little else,"God, this was bad. It was pretentious, serious, and dull. The author likes one-sentence paragraphs, and her characters are melodramtic and serious and tedious. She has a really annoying habit of italicizing significant things, but she does it every twentieth sentence or so, so you keep getting pulled up short by something that isn't really that dramatic getting the dramatic treatment. The characters are superficially different but that's only on the surface: the guy is still a stud----so much so that the author feels compelled to, um, confide the dimensions of his endowment, and I'm not talking about his trust fund---while the heroine is just blah. After a few chapters, the seriousness and the pretense just got to me, but I should have given up, frankly, when the writer breathlessly confided that bit about the guy's, er, moneymaker, I guess you could call it, and did it in italics. It was painful."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to reading THE LOVER, but I didn't think the book lived up to its promise. Robin Schone is a fine writer, and I thoroughly enjoyed The Lady's Tutor and her short story in Captivated, but this book just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was darker and more gothic than I expected. Maybe the abuse of the hero turned me off. Maybe I didn't feel drawn in to the relationship of Anne and Michel. I was looking forward to the next erotic anthology from Kensington in the fall. But now I'm not so sure..."
1,Not enjoyable,"I read two of Schone's previous works, Awaken My Love and The Lady's Tutor, and really enjoyed them, so I was looking forward to this book. I could barely finish it. It's dark, gloomy, and negative, and the writing style is cold and choppy. The characters were not likeable, and the sex was not interesting. I read for enjoyment and passion, not to be depressed. This book went into the trash when I was done. Too bad. She started out writing good books, but I won't read another one of hers."
3,Robin must have read Anne Rampling!,"This is the first book I've read of Ms. Schone's, from a guys point of view the book delivers on it's erotic tale but I found the romance a bit weak. I started reading these types of books to pass time on the subway and a few times I found myself wondering why I had chosen this book. I guess the cover was nice. I would recommend this book if you have nothing else to read, or if you wanted a history lesson."
1,Dull! dull! dull!,"The story line in the lover is like a negligee, wispy andbarely there. The dialogue is entirely centered on intimate activity,and it's almost as though the characters do not exist above the waist. The Lover is a derivative of The Lady's Tutor and A Lady's Pleasure, with nothing really new or different added to it. Worse yet, The Lover drove home the point that Susan Johnson is one of the few writers who can open a novel with a sexy scene and then capture and hold the reader's interest throughout. Why is this so? Susan Johnson actually dares to provide a substantial story.It's been three days since I've had this book; I'm barely half-way through and can't find a good reason to finish -- apart from the fact I spent my money unwisely. END"
1,I agree with one reviewer calling this book Vomit-inducing,"Definitely vomit-inducing. The author tried to make the hero appear as troubled and as tortured as possible - that he experienced the worst and most disgusting things that could happen to a human being, even as low as eating maggots. It was gross to say the least. The heroine paid a lot of money to experience sexual pleasure for a month, what she experienced was'nt pleasure at all. The sex scenes were devoid of any tenderness and emotion. They were so clinical, a sex ed teacher could have done a better job. The plot is not romantic, more horror than love story."
3,Not really very impressed...,"Robin Schone writes some pretty steamy romantic erotica, but this particular book was not nearly as good as Gabriel's Woman."
2,Dissapointed,"After being deeply touched by Ms. Schones previous stories, I eagerly anticipated her newest. I am still wondering what ""The Lover"" was about, other than gratuitous sex scenes (and not very stimulating ones at that). ""The Lady's Tutor"" involved characters who suffered serious emotional traumas and overcame the difficulties to find a wonderous love. It was the most sensual novel I have ever read. In ""The Lover"" the characters seem unable or unwilling to make the effort to rise above their problems and almost seem content to wallow in their misery. I know that Ms. Schone has enormous talent and I hope her next effort is a story that makes the reader wish the book wasn't ending as she has done in her earlier works."
2,Porno meets Silence of the Lambs???,"Too dark for me, barely kept my interest, felt extremely creepy while reading it...forced myself to finish it. Sorry, but don't waste your money."
5,An international cry for peace!,"With stunning photos, ""2/15: the Day the World Said No to War"" powerfully documents the largest world-wide anti-war demonstration in history, exhibiting snapshots of marches in Japan, Chile, Antartica, South Africa, Denmark, Spain, the Netherlands, Iraq, Australia, Israel, Bangledesh, France, Argentina and the U.S.A, among other locales. This beautiful montage of inspirational pictures testifies to the diverse concerns, perspectives, strategies and dreams of an international movement for peace and global justice."
4,American takes us to Europe,"To be honest, I really could care less that Arthur Foote ""borrowed"" his sound from Brahms, Dvorak, Shumann and Mendelssohn. It's just refreshing to hear music that ""sounds"" like something I already know, but yet is unfamiliar because it really isn't from any of the aforementioned composers. The recording which pairs the Da Vinci Quartet with an excellent pianist is wonderful!"
5,Beautiful and Disturbing,Homotopy to Marie is one of the better early recordings from Nurse With Wound. It's dark and disturbing without being too silly. Sparce sounds with dislocated voices drifting in hallways. A must have.
5,C'mon It's Sam Cooke,Classic material from a classic individual. It is a very refreshing album. Lot of good material for such a low price.
3,Well done,It's a great record. I love to play it. It is a pity that this man died so young. What would happened if he was able to write and sing the songs he used to do.
5,Listen Again and Again,"This is a unbelievable collection of tunes from one of the greatest soul men of all time. If you do not have it in your collection, you're going to need to add it sooner or later. No matter what style of music you primarily enjoy, as long as you are a fan of American music, you will be in the mood for this record (and only this record) at least once or twice a year. I prefer the soul music that came just a bit later (i.e. Gaye, Mayfield, Green), mostly for its deep lyrical content and funky grooves, but no one can beat Cooke for good-natured infectiousness."
4,Vintage Sam,"The collection of songs on this cd is awesome. Shows Sam Cooke at his very best in a wide range of material. Sam Cooke was such a talented man. He had such an incredibly short time on this earth, yet he made a huge impact on the music industry. His rendition of love songs cannot be duplicated, to this day. And as a gospel singer he had no equal. His entire range is well represented on this collection. Very Happy with it and would recommend it to anyone."
5,Sam Cooke Portrait of a Legend 1951-1964,This CD is fantastic! Every song is great and the remastering provides a clean sound to the classic songs of the Legendary Sam Cooke!
2,Don't buy SACD,"First of all, this is a fantastic CD the music is excellent.5 stars for sure. But the Hybrid SACD format is a huge disappointment. In this day and age anyone with an extensive music collection knows the advantages of ripping to a computer and then managing files for ease of play or to create and or burn play lists. This SACD crap is another screwed up design by record companies to fool the public into thinking that a slightly better sound quality is a reason to give up this convenience. You can not copy the CD portion of this disc to mp3 or WAV files. The computer drive does not recognize it. So I have to go back in time and pop a CD in and out of my CD/DVD player to hear this... GIVE ME A BREAK!! Do not support this ridiculous format."
2,Won't play on my Car's mp3 player,"I've purchased 1000's of MP3 songs from Amazon and the main purpose is so I can play them while driving my car. This is the only album of over a hundred, that won't play in my car's cd player. I've tried copying the mp3's several times to different cd's with always the same result: the cd loads, and then skips past each song on this album, then will play the first song it finds not from this album.The album plays fine on my computer, but won't play on my car's mp3 player. Perhaps a newer mp3 player would work, I don't know. The mp3 player I'm using came built in to my 2006 Ford Fusion."
4,5 STARS to Sam Cooke But One Song is Missing!,"This is a must have collection it has all of Sam Cooke's great hits. However, Sam Cooke's version of ""Almost in your arms"" from the movie Houseboat that won best song of the year in 1958 isn't included. I felt this song should have been part of this compliation because Sam Cooke put's his heart into this love ballad just like he does in all his other songs."
2,Mehaz Professional Cuticle Nipper,"I ordered this cuticle nipper after reading the great reviews. However, I am not impressed with the product. The only way it cuts is to do it with the very tip of the nipper. I really should have returned it because I haven't been using it....$30 wasted!"
3,Beat Pharmacy - Earthly Delights,"An Afro-house-dub melange on Beat Pharmacy's debut, EARTHLY DELIGHTS. The reverb is set on high, and the grooves are set on stun! ""Cape Town"" clearly has its roots in Afrobeat, while ""Race Track Jockey"" stems from Jamaica (with sweeps from Basic Channel-era Berlin). Some of the more downtempo tracks fade from consciousness, however, leaving only the high points and tracks also tend towards being overly long -- contrast the jazzy ""Monkey's Wedding"" to the more plodding ""New Dawn."" As well, some of the world music influences seem awkward, as on ""Afrotech."" ""Don't Bodda Me"" avoids this, mostly thanks to Paul St. Hilaire's vocals, while ""Scratching a Surface"" takes a more pure Basic Channel ethos with a slower rhythm. So while EARTHLY DELIGHTS manages to have these different international perspectives, he doesn't quite integrate them all successfully."
2,Beat Pharmacy not for me,"I heard one track on Somafm and thought it sounded interesting. That track was, the rest was not. As with a lot of internet radio they seem only play to the best track."
3,A Response to September 11,"This booklet was written as a response to the events of Sept. 11. Psalm 46 is the main text used by Mr. Heitzig. This booklet is divided into 5 chapters. The author reminds readers of God's presence, peace and power. In chapter 5 the author lays out the proper response to terror for God's followers. Stillness and Surrender and Repentance and Prayer are given as the solution."
2,Not to be confused with a science book,"The science advanced is selectively interjected to sustain a religious viewpoint. This is not a science book that advances the unarguable evidence that evolution is both a fact and the unifying theory underpinning modern biology. Interesting, but many students are not yet equipped to see through a weak and selective presentation of science."
4,Good for newbies like me.,"Did a great job of explaining the various gauges, tracks, and wiring. Good photos and diagrams to get me up and running."
3,"Sadly, only a little piece of history.","I came across this album in a budget (and I do mean budget) clearing house in Western Australia a couple of years ago.It is the sort of album that collects dust for most of the time, then something will get me thinking of Marc's sad end and I get it out to play just to hear where he might have been heading musically had he lived.By today's professional standards I suppose it sounds fairly tawdry, as in it's obviously analog recording and MONO (was it that long ago???)however there is a genuine upbeat feel to the versions of T.Rex favorites. I recommend this album for those fans who want to hear Marc's last output before his untimely death in '77"
5,A great inside look at the earliest days of cryptography,Anyone interested in the inner workings of ANY cryptoanalyst needs to read this book. Told in the first person Yardley reveals the amazing amount of genius and hard work cryptography required before the days of calculators and computers. It really is a great read.
4,"Great for sure, but . . .","An excellent read for sure; however, Yardley is no writer--overall, it is extremely poorly writing. The information presented is sometimes repetitive. The grammar and editing are both poor. But, the story makes up the gap and tends to compensate if one reads the forest instead of the trees."
4,Satisfied but ...,"I am very satisfied with the delivery, which set less time than planned. On the other hand I am a little disappointed by the frame of the poster: it encroaches on the words and the drawing."
1,DON'T BE DECEIVED,"Don't be deceived by the professional looking cover and artwork; this CD is horrible. Something has been done to the original versions and they obviously sound different from what you or I would have heard. Then there are the other unknown songs (remember that the title of the CD is ""Most Famous Hits"") that are littered here and there, then there is the sound quality that leaves a lot to be desired and then, there are some of the songs that have obviously been selected from a live performance. Heard enough?"
1,AVOID!,"Not only have they layered cheezy, low-budget synths over the tracks, they've done an unimaginably terrible job of it. It sounds as if the synth was playing in one room and the original recording was playing in another - and a warped vinyl copy at that. This was someone's bad idea of a joke. Do not pay anything for this.... Burt needs to sue somebody."
3,Remedy To Lessen Ear Burden,"Well i just got this today, while bad,i don't feel it as bad as some have said,but i might have felt the same if i didn't have a remedy....being a big record collector, i have a replica retro-style turntable that i use to play older records for that ""older"" sound that i desire,now ,this player also has a cd player built in,so when i play it in this player it sounds like a really good quality record, rather than what it sounded like on my surround sound,which was not so good!!!:) As for the added synth, i have to ask why? the hollow moodiness of some songs are intentional and don't need to be changed or ""fixed""!!!!Sound quality aside, that is my biggest gripe!!!"
2,Not so fantastic,My son is a huge Scooby fan and he did not care for this movie at all. I didn't watch it but I consider him the expert.
4,Pretty Good,"I kind of liked it because all their defense didn't work but they still solved the mystery.It was also pretty scary and kind of funny.By WB, age 5 3/4"
5,Scary Scooby Doo Fun,I bought this for my 5-year-old's birthday and we've already watched it many times. Note that this movie is scarier than the original Scooby I watched as a kid in the 70s and some of the recent movies so you be the judge of what your child is comfortable watching. One of the bad guys runs swinging an ax but you never see blood or anyone get hurt. I love that the characters haven't been changed or gone all politically correct. Scooby is good old-fashioned fun for the whole family.
4,Scooby Doo and,Who can pass up Scooby Doo? Have been a fan for years and enjoy watching Scooby Doo with our grandchildren!
5,funny,"My brother loved this movie, it is hilarious..one can never get enough scooby. good christmas stocker for any children. very hilarious."
4,Good but a might scare the little ones,This is a good story centered around Fred's old campgrounds from when he was a kid. The mystery involves three creatures that were legend around the lake where the camp is. They turn up and are trying to close the camp down and get everyone to leave. The gang has to figure out why they want it closed and who is doing it. It overall sticks to the standard Scooby Doo blueprint and is enjoyable. The only reason four stars and this review is to let you know that there are a few parts that might scare the little ones. It seems they were gearing it for halloween and some older kids. There are a lot more intense chase scenes and surprising times when the bad guys jump out that will have the younger ones jumping. Other than that is a great movie.
5,Good Old Scooby-Doo!,"This is a great movie in the tradition of Scooby Doo! There is a mystery! The gang tries to solve it! There are people pretending to be monsters! A lot of Scooby Doo movies veer away from the traditional, LOVED Scooby Doo plot. Not this one. It is a fun movie - the animation is a bit cleaner than the old series, but the atmosphere is the same. I highly recommend this Scooby movie. Parents will enjoy it as much as their kids!"
4,Keyontay,"My son loves this movie, he watches this movie over and over when he get home from school. Thank you."
5,Very Pleased,"This is true to form Scooby movie. It is adult friendly, and kid friendly. If you have a younger child it may scare them in some spots, in the beginning my 3year old needs to sit by me. Good humor, good mystery, good movie."
1,dvd player scared of camp scare?,"i was very unhappy with this purchase. movie mars sent a dvd that was unplayable 'in my region'. you would think they would know where the product was being sent to and send a playable product. due to the unplayable dvd, i was stuck with an unhappy daughter, and had to return the product at my own cost. refund was only for dvd amount so between cost of shipping to me & back to them and the cost of the dvd elsewhere i ended up paying 2x the original amount through movie mars. will not take a chance ordering movies through this supplier again. my 5 year old daughter loves the movie but be wary of the supplier."
4,Always a pleasure to watch an old favorite,"Scooby Doo: Camp Scare is a delightful return to the old style of mysteries. The movie is upbeat, funny and while providing the requisite ""scares"" no one ever gets hurt and the chase scenes are fabulous. I loved the movie and it's quickly become one of my favorites. The graphics are great and the characters were spot on."
5,I love this book,"This is my 3rd book I have been through. I use this in my daycare and all my kids love it. It is part colored foil and all interactive(kids will flock to this book) It promotes counting, colors, shapes, compare and contrast and time"
4,fascinating for very young toddler/baby,"I picked this up at a bookstore in the remainder bin, and it was definitely worth the less than five dollars I paid for it. While it's not all that beautifully designed and the ""learning"" aspects are quite pedestrian, it is the largest board book I have ever found, which my son loves, and it's taken a lot of abuse.The ""illustrations"" (really basic and quite dull line drawings) throughout are overlaid with prismatic foil, which is the real attraction in addition to the sturdy board book construction and large size.Even the clock, with its moving hands, is holding up well, though as my husband noted, it will no doubt fall apart before our son is old or interested enough to actually learn to tell time."
5,Great fun for my 10 and 6 year old,My 10 year old loves this because he can set this up to guard his room and sound a voice alarm if someone goes in. Or to play games with us. My 6 year old loves it mainly because she can record and play back all kinds of sounds and her voice. It's very durable and better than any tape player. Great value.
5,This is a great toy!,"My son got one for Christmas and we had to get one for my daughter for her birthday. They have a lot of fun with this toy! Well worth the price, which is inexpensive!"
5,Cool I WANT IT!,Hi the spy club name is Spys rule like boys & i'm 10 anyway what store is it in can you win it for free if you can revew please anwswer Spys rule loging out.
3,Its ok I guess,"Bought it to cover our ugly old tile outside of our house where we usually hang out with the kids. It is too thin, wrinkled and moves around a lot when you walk on it. It's like a plastic fake short grass, looked and felt cheap. But I guess if you buy it for car trips and want to use on the ground may be it's a good solution."
5,"Wonderful love story, excellent mythology!","Roberta Gellis is truly special. Her characters, the choices they make, the way the think and decide, she has a way of really describing what happens ""inside"" people to lead them to act. At the same time, the stories she tells are exciting, well thought out and original.With this book, she writes the first in her new subject, (up to now, it was Medievals - I hichly recommend them and a series of Regencies I loved, too) old Greek myths, and the story of Hades and Persephone is fresh, exciting and believable. I couldn't put it down and I reread it occasionally, like the others in the series, Shimmering Splendour and Echanted Fire. Though this one is the best of her Greek stories so far."
3,"I liked it, but...","After reading Thrice Bound, I was thrilled to find a book by Roberta Gellis about my favorite myth of all time: that of the marriage of Hades and Persephone. Sadly, the book didn't live up to my expectations.Don't get me wrong- I still enjoyed the book. Gellis's humor and plot devices are a lot of fun. I also am happy with her take on Persephone as a strong, independent woman and her marriage as being a happy one. But, I found some parts of the book trite and some of the situations forced. Also, being pagan myself, I found the characters which depicted the gods one-sided and ill-dignified. Maybe that's just me- but still, in some of the more negative descriptions of the character using Demeter's name, I couldn't help but cringe.So, I wish I could give it 4 stars, but well, thems the breaks."
3,Expectation unfulfilled,"Did not meet my expectation because the book is intended specifically for ESL community, not for the general reading public."
1,bad experence,this book's edition is wrong. my classmates is book of color. this book is white and blank.
3,Repetitive and Ridiculous,The good: it was funny and I liked both Becca and Turner. The bad: the premise is just ridiculous. Come on...Becca starts throwing herself at Turner because of a hypnotic suggestion and of course her desire passes if she falls asleep before going all the way leaving her to rethink her actions again and again. I prefer the author to try and make it seem at least a little believable. I would recommend this book if you are looking for a light and fluffy romance and don't care that the plot is beyond silly.
4,Light Snack,"Great light read. Fun, quick wit, and a fast read. Elizabeth Bevarly's books are always fun and a good read!"
5,Won't be selling THIS one!,"Anyone who has had the hots for a ""friend"" will thoroughly enjoy Bevarly's portrayal of friends whose relationship evolves into something more. This book is about the hottest thing I've read in ages. Turner is hot, AND a hoot. My perfect man candy!"
5,Dog Crates,"I looked everywhere for a crate big enough so my puppy would not bump his shoulders on the way in and out. Finally! And it's very attractive and well built, folds up easily. I also like the mini door and top opening. This is the best dog crate and I have several. I ordered another little one for my other dog because it's so good."
1,ddon't waste ur money...,i have 2 dogs who r both under 75lbs and within 2 weeks the bottoms of both the brand new creats split... my dogs are not in them for more than 6 hours a day. I'm disgusted with them!!
1,Dog bend wire bars,"Our 3 month old puppy (lab/boxer mix) bent the bars, ultimately removing many completely. The problem is that with the many doors, it makes several places on the cage very vulnerable to this."
1,confusing,i can't understand how anyone who has johnny winters best interest at heart would release a concert that does not show johnny in a good light. his longtime health problems become more of a focus on this dvd than the music which is a shame.
2,Love Johnny but can't recommend.....,"Johnny Winter is seated during the entire performance and it's obvious his health is failing and/or something serious has happened to him. His voice is all but gone. His mind may be sharp but his fingers can no longer deliver like before. I have liked and enjoyed Johnny for years; that's why I bought this DVD. Although its sound and video quality is inferior, buy ""Pieces and Bits"" instead. I would be embarrassed if I handled Johnny's affairs and allowed this video to be released. I would return this but, unfortunately, it's not defective."
1,BAD!,"This is the WORST Johnny Winter performance I've ever seen. This man was an ACE and I'm kind of surprised they released this DVD. Lot's of Harmonica solos, where years ago, it would have been all guitar solos. Pass on this one."
1,STILL ALIVE.... BUT NOT WELL.................,"I'VE SEEN JOHNNY MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS AND WAS SHOCKED IN 1997 WHEN HE CLOSED THE DOHENEY BLUES FESTIVAL IN DANA POINT , CA. HE HAD TO BE HELPED TO THE STAGE BY TWO ROADIES AND ONE HAD TO HELP HIM PUT ON HIS GUITAR. I WAS UNAWARE OF HIS HEALTH PROBLEMS AND WAS TAKEN BACK BY HIS CONDITION. FAST FORWARD TO THE LATEST DVD AND I AM SURPRISED THAT THIS WOULD BE RELEASED. ON THIS DVD YOU CAN SEE THAT HE IS IN VERY POOR HEALTH. SO MUCH SO THAT HE CAN HARDLY SING OR PLAY. JOHNNY IS ONE OF ROCKS ALL TIME LEGENDS AND DESERVES BETTER THAN THIS. I COULD ONLY WATCH A FEW SONGS AND HAD TO TURN IT OFF. I HAVE A DVD OF HIM PERFORMING IN 1979 AND PUT THAT ONE ON TO REGAIN MY RIGHT FRAME OF MIND. HE WAS IN RARE FORM AND THAT REKINDLED MY INTEREST AGAIN. IF YOU CAN FIND IT, TRY JOHNNY WINTER AT ROCKPALAST IN 1979. THAT DVD ROCKS........."
2,Hard to handle.....manage your expectation right,"I preordered this DVD with anticipation as I've only listened to JohnnyWinter's music for a long long time. However, I've taught myself to lower my expectation that this performance is not during his glory days as currently his health/age(60yrs for an albino is not easy feat!)affected his agility and guitar technique. Gone are the fast licks as I can see that his right hand is trembling and he is seated throughout the performance. Gone also are the growling voice.Nonetheless, this is a must for any Winter's fan collection. Just ask yourself, are you able to play at 90yrs old? Even Stevie Nicks can't reach the high notes anymore!2 stars is not for DVD production but rather that those who expect a grand performance will be disappointed.I'm still happy to see him perform.The bonus interview material also include a 3min jams with the harp player(also very cool!)"
1,Hard to watch,"This was hard to watch. I've had the pleasure of seeing Johnny play 3 times during the 70's and a couple of good performances on TV. (most notable, his appearance on Don Kirshener's Rock Concert on the same night with Deep Purple during his ""Still Alive and Well"" tour...this footage should have been included on ""Bits & Pieces"") But I could barely watch this. I feel sad for him that he's degenerated so much physically (or hopefully not back into that ""habit"") but this should have never been released. He deserves to be better remembered."
2,Johnny Winter-Live in Times Square,I am in my 50's and have been a Winter fan for over 4 decades but this concert is just sad! No one should have encouraged Johnny to do this show. He is obviously ill and very frail. He was a amazing guitar player and blues vocalist but to have this performance be a lasting memory of his talent is unthinkable. Leave his memory intact and avoid this sad end to great career.
2,time to hang it up,"we know that father time will slow you down, but when you get to the point that age and illness affects your ability put on an entertaing show maybe its time to head off into the sunset, johnnys backup band is solid which makes his decline even more noticable. his voice is a shell of his glory days and he struggles mightily to play his once blistering leads. johnny thank you for all the good years but please leave us with some better memories."
4,TEAC CD Player,"remote has limited functionsworks very well - takes a while to play once disk readbut I was looking for a functional, low budget, one disk player and I got itmatched with its receiver it powers Polk Audiospeakers just fine"
2,My thoughts on the Teac CD-1260,I believe it could have been better and made easier to operate. One of the things I saw that was missing was the time wasn't the best and it does not show how much time is left when playing any particular track. Don't get me wrong it does play good it's just that I like to see how long any one track may be as I like to time them out.
3,Good except for MP3s,"I bought this to replace an old single CD player which faltered with home burnt CD-Rs. The first unit I received worked fine on CD-Rs, but it skipped trying to play MP3s. I returned it (great return policy, by the way) and was cross-shipped another unit. It also skips on MP3s. But since I rarely play that format, I'm keeping it, since it is so difficult to find single CD players these days. Before purchasing, I also tried my DVD player, but you need to have the TV on in order to see enou menu items."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this CD player primarily because the product description specified that it was capable of playing data-recorded MP3's. The installation was as simple as any run-of-the-mill CD player. The regular CD playback works fine; however, the data MP3's on playback SKIP constantly, hence I can't use that feature, because while it recognizes the MP3 mode it won't play the tracks all the way through. I was going to return the unit but decided to keep it only because my old CD player was already acting up and needed to be replaced anyhow. So if you're looking for a cheap replacement for a traditional CD, this is a good enough unir, but if you're thinking of using it to play MP3s, don't bother."
4,Can't Read CD,"Bought this player despite all the negative reviews. After one week the player could not read clean store cd's or CD-r's. When I cleaned the player everything seemed fine...until two days later. Same problem.What I tried was inserting a CD-r and store bought. When ""can't read cd"" showed up I just let it sit for about an hour with the cd in player. Eventually it did show that the disc had been read and played. Worked like a charm. I have not had any problems to date. Don't ask why this works. It almost seems like you're forcing the player to read the CD. Good luck...hope this helps.Kevin O'ReillyLouisville, KY"
5,teac p1260 cd player,I am extremely satisfied with yhe p1260 cd player. Sound quality is very good. The single cd player makes for a more durable player for long term use. Its remote permits easy movement to the desired music on each disc.
5,Works well,Works fine for me. Well worth the price. I replaced an old worn out NAD and can't tell the difference.
3,Pros & Cons,My last CD player was a good TEAC. This one isn't. It's very basic so must have been an outdated model. Not recommended.
1,Does not play 60% of my commercially purchased CDs,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK! Will not play any budget priced CD. Other CDs will work sometimes. I've tried brand new CDs, previously played CDs, new & used library quality CDs, etc.This player will consistently display, ""NO DISC"" then a few days later, I'll try same disc & it plays fine. Most annoying to me is if it does play disc, it frequently will stop in middle of track & turn off. Sometimes I can restart disc & it plays ok but often the player will continue to stop at random places (not at the same place on disc)and I give up.I've had this player since xmas 2010 & have tried every possibility I know of in attempt to make it work. I test cds when they fail to play by trying them in my portable CD player & a boombox. They work fine."
1,Malfunction issues...,"After less than a two year ownership of this CD Player, it has completely stopped reading CDs. It has been treated with utmost care and played with normal regularity (3 or 4 times a week for a few hours at a time). The CD player I owned prior to this one lasted 10 years before succumbing to the same malfunctioning issue. Other customers (as you might have noticed) are experiencing this malfunctioning issue as well. So at your own risk... it's cheap."
1,Unfortunate,"Thought this unit would do it for me. I am retiring my Onkyo R-1 after 22 years service. It has started skipping, and the drawer mechanism is less than ideal. Single drawer stand alon players are getting hard to find, at least at this price. The unit sounded great; better than the old unit. I played several different cd's right after it arrive. Played great...for about an hour. Then it became progressively more distorted. I was listening through phones. I pulled them out and listened through the amp. Same thing. Through the speakers...same thing. Then it wouldn't move to the next track. Eventually, it would only display the track listing. And nothing more. Very disappointing, TEAC. I sent it back the next morning..."
2,Won't play CD-R discs,"This is an acceptable CD player if you are only playing commercially made CDs. If you want to play CDs that you have burned on your computer, this player won't do it, despite the claims that it can. I could not get it to play a single one. I'm returning the one I bought for this reason."
3,TEAC CD-P1260 CD Player with LCD and MP3 Playback,It plays only one CD at a time. It doesn't have a connection for a connector for an MP3 device. That is what I thought it meant by MP3 playback. This misunderstanding disappointed me. But the player does work well.
3,undecided,as my stereo broke before the unit showed up and haven't got it fixed yet I can't tell you how it works; but I seen the 5 disc players on sale here after for the same price and would have got it instead of the single disc player.
5,Best product for us.,"Nice product, easy to use and looks good. I just wanted good quality and ease of use."
4,cd player,after an initial problem - incorrect stock info and then the player arrived and didn't work! However its replacemeny( by the way excellent service) did work. Its simple and very easy to operate. It replaced an old Technics player I had and was ideal ie no cable changes etc. Good price and whats on the box you get!
1,THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CD PLAYER. WHEN MINE ARRIVED EVERY DISKI PUT IN IT DID NOT PLAY. IT WAS ONE ""NO DISC"" MESSAGE AFTER ANOTHER.WHY CAN'T YOU BUY A SINGLE PLAY COMPONENT PLAYER ANYWHERE? HAVETHEY STOPPED MAKING THEM. YOU WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE A DEMANDFOR THEM. IS EVERYONE USING CHEAP DVD PLAYERS?I BOXED UP THIS PIECE OF CRAP AND SENT IT BACK TO AMAZON LTDAFTER HAVING IT FOR ONE HOUR. IT DOES NOT WORK. AVOID IT LIKE THEPLAGUE."
4,Denon CD player review,"I have rated 4 and not 5 stars because when on Random mode the CD player seems to favor 2 or 3 CDs out of the 5 that have been loaded. This detracts from the overall ""random"" experience that the listener expects to have."
3,TEAC CD P1260 CD,"I like the programming options and general operating features. The problem I have is that sometimes I have to insert the CD several times before it will be read, even then some will not be read. The same CD's will work fine in my other players."
1,POS - Don't Waste Your Money,"Like many other reviewers, this player works for a few months than absolutely refuses to read discs. Even tried CD lens cleaners...TEAC should be ashamed of itself for selling this so called ""product."""
4,Nearly what I wanted,"Just what I thought I wanted. A single CD player. Everything aboutit that I have tried, has worked. I'm sure there is an occassional unitthat is DOA on arrival.My experience has been happier. The unit I bought works as advertised. andsounds very good indeed.There is one thing, however, that I wish I could do with the remote control -turn the unit on or off. If that function had been included, then I would behard-pressed not to give it a 5 star rating."
4,Single C.D. Player,"I bought two of these for my D.J. Equip. (I'm old school) they were to replace my JVC's which are 17 years old. I needed this size for my coffin. I have 2 CD players, a mixer, and a light bar mounted in the coffin. The only feature I don't like on them, is there is no ""countdown"" on tracks playing. It makes it a little harder. Overall I like them though. Hope they last as long as the JVC's."
5,Cd player,"Pleased with sound so much we replace old cd player with this, the sound from this came though much better than listening though the Bose all in one system."
4,TEAC CD-P1260 CD Player,This is a modestly equipped single CD player of superior quality. It serves my purpose is very well.CSF
4,4 stars for value,"I chose this unit (CD-P1260) over other brands because it seemed like a good deal on AMAZON. When it arrived, I put it through several hours of play time and an obstacle course of home-made and store-purchased cds, and rapid function checks, trying to get it to fault-out. It performed as well as I would expect, and sounded fine. The only notable issue was that it stumbled over, and lost a few tracks on some home-made recordings burned from older equipment. I attribute this problem to the recording itself, because the TEAC had no problem tracking the original, store bought disc. I've owned much more expensive cd players that performed the same way. I'll add that I was also pleased when the TEAC effortlessly read and played through flaws on some CDs that will cause another player of mine to skip. Cosmetically speaking, the unit is simple and straightforward, with an LCD display that, again, reminds me of one used on more expensive players."
4,Nice unit - good single player.,"I would reccomend this unit to anyone who is looking for a good & simple, single player. Out of the box, plug in & simple controls makes this unit well worth the money. I have played new, cd-r, and old & beat up. I haven't had any problems at all.Kelly"
5,VERY GOOD PLAYER,I'VE BEEN BUYING TEAC PRODUCTS FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. HAVE A REEL TO REEL THAT STILL WORKS (OVER 30 YEARS OLD). HAD A TEAC CD RECORDER (8 TO 10 YEARS OLD) THAT THIS ITEM REPLACES. CANNOT BEAT TEAC FOR LONGEVITY OR QUALITY. SOUND QUALITY VERY GOOD. YES WOULD RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO A FRIEND. CAN NOT BEAT THE QUALITY OR PRICE. PLAYS MP3 CDS FOR HOURS OF ENJOYMENT.
1,"""NO DISK""","We have had this unit for about 15 months. It now gives a ""NO DISK"" message when a clean, commercially produced music CD is inserted. A call to TEAC resulted in finding out that it would probably cost about half as much just to get a diagnosis as the unit cost originally. Count me among those disillusioned with TEAC."
1,didn't work,"There's nothing to review - the cd player arrived as promised, was easy to set up and, alas, didn't work - pushed the button to open the tray and, although the lcd showed what steps it was going through, the door never opened. Oh, well. I requested a return authorization and a refund. And, I have to pay the return postage and wait four weeks for a refund! Terrible!"
2,doesn't read,"Like some other reviewers, I've had trouble with it refusing to read discs - not just ones I burned myself, but regular old store-bought music discs . My old player could play the same discs, so I'd say this model is a lemon. The problem is only sporadic, but it's annoying enough that you might want to think twice about taking the chance. Too bad, because in other respects it seems well-made. The blue LCD backlight is gorgeous."
1,Low Grade Shareware,"The interface and functions of this program appear and behave like a clunky beta version of lowgrade shareware. The program shell doesn't size correctly to the desktop, ironically leaving the ""Hide"" button hidden. The software doesn't deliver on its performance promises in too many ways. The keystrokes it captured were not only random and limited, but were cluttered with a lot of garbage that was never typed. Instant message captures were random as well. Not all messages were captured. Screenshots worked okay. Documentation is non-existent, and support is available via e-mail only. It strikes me that this software is simply not ready for release, and is not a suitable choice for adequate child protection - not at this or any other price. I'll be looking at SpectorPro from Spector Software."
3,It's aight !,"Quiet eye is an alright spy for your PC, better than any other PC spyers that I've seen and tried!"
5,I'd rate higher..,I absolutely loved this book. I just can't believe how much I loved it. I was surprised how much I liked Etienne's mistress.. I was not expecting that. I read ALOT and have never read a book where I actually liked the mistress and she wasn't a *****. I would recommend this to anyone. I do wish it was a little longer or had at least something that told us about possible children. READ IT!!! : )
4,love to read,this was a very good book but it took a very long time to get to the action .but once the book got there it was hard to put down.
2,Sea Pieces played MUCH too fast,"I love the Sea Pieces and the New England Idylls especially, and have worked at playing them myself over the years. But after hearing this recording of the Sea Pieces played on my local NPR station, I have to wonder exactly which edition of the score the pianist is using. For example, my copy of the score says a quarter note = 66 for the first of the Sea Pieces, and also marked to play ""with didgnity and breadth"". But this recording sounds like it is in the range ot 132+ This can't possibly be correct. The pianist wasn't as much out of line with piece #2, but then in piece #3 a dotted quarter is only indicated as = 58. But this recording just barrels along.If you want your MacDowell played with artificial bravura, then this CD id definitely for you. But if you would rather have more adherence to the composers intentions, then you must look elsewhere.Yet it is wonderful that these pieces are finally getting recorded at all."
3,Boring Blackbeard,"This book is very historical and full of facts and footnotes but that is its downfall. We don't get to see the real, personal man. It has alot of North Carolina politics and deals with some of the relations of England to the colonies but most people want to get to know the man intimately. It does tell of his death and the aftermath and goes into the legal fallout after Blackbeard's death, such as who had legal right to Blackbeard's loot. All in all I would rate it as average read."
3,Edward Teach and the Outer Banks,"Piracy in the 1600s was an accepted way of life; Queen Elizabeth allowed English pirates free rein against the Spanish, which added greatly to Spain's defeat. Edward Teach (Blackbeard) ruled over unruly seamen and struck terror in coastal towns in North Carolina (Bath, Edenton). He also had 14 wives! He was killed in Orakoke Inlet by Robert Maynard, who was sent by the governor of Virginia. It's an interesting story in our Colonial history, but Lee is not so compelling a writer. He relates the facts, but leaves out the human side."
5,Blackbeard the Pirate,"Edward Teach, aka Blackbeard, was likely the most infamous ofall pirates, to such a degree that his name has become almost mythical. Robert E. Lee (not the Civil War general) has done an outstanding jobof digging into documented history to separate fact from fiction in thistelling of the notorious pirate captain's life. Lee's writing style is suchthat this historical perspective is both informative and fascinating; areal page-turned of a history book. Also, beyond the accounting ofEdward Teach, the book gives us a look into the society of England andher American colonies of the time, giving us a better understanding ofpirates and piracy in general."
4,Double Standards,This is a movie of a father with two standards one for his child and another for his new wife when it comes to abortions. Good performance by George Scott and Melissa Gilbert.
3,Doctor Smith gets into trouble again,"This is a typical lost in space epic in which Dr. Smith eats fuit which is unsafe.As a result,he turns into a giant. Not a bad episode but certainly not one of the best. The camera work is pretty well done that shows a 20 ft tall mift Dr. Smith."
3,Great for Code Writers ONLY,"I had to return this book, only because of my unfamiliarity with UNIX. Long gone are the days when I used to knock out code. I've been spoiled (ruined some might say) by years of GUI and the heavy use of utility programs.If you like using Console on your MAC you'd probably get a kick from using this book.I wanted to leave my review 'unrated' because I consider myself unqualified to judge its utility, not because it is necessarily a poor manual, but the Review form required I supply some rating so I chose 'middle of the road' 3 stars."
4,bleep bleep,"boogie metal, without those damn annoying cowbells...you know? tink tink tinka-tink?and yeah, good on a tee too."
3,boring but ok,The book was boring and hard to get into at first. Maybe that is telling me something. I like the different ideas he got from other teachers. they were the most interesting.
5,"Great for those who want to become passionate, effective teachers.","I purchased this book for a course I'm taking this spring, but I started reading it when it arrived. I finished it before the course even began. The book brings up many issues with teaching and not only does it describe what a passionate teacher is, but also how to become one. This book is definitely a keeper, I'm sure I'll refer to it many times throughout my teaching career."
5,this cd is awsome,this has got to be the best cd i have ever heard in my whole entire life... these guys are pour genious and deserve a nobel peace prize for discovering how to make great music...p.s...not so much.
3,Bought but didn't use,I bought this book hoping to do some things with my kids in spanish. But it was a little too basic and my kids didn't have the attention span for some of the more interesting activites. I didn't really use it.
5,"Didn't want anyone to see the title, but...","...it was VERY helpful. I bought 7 books on travel to England, but the ones I took with me on the trip were London for Dummies and Middleditch's London Mapguide.The reason: ""Dummies"" is stuffed with practical nuts-&-bolts information. Not just suggestions of palaces & pubs, but tips on etiquette, taxes, and emergencies, and phone numbers & addresses on nearly every page. Having never been abroad on my own before, I wanted a reference with me that contained all the essential how-to information I needed-- especially on one panic-stricken morning when my credit card wouldn't work! You can believe I was hugging ""Dummies"" when I found my company's service number in the appendix.When traveling, you don't want to carry unnecessary weight. Dummies gives you more practical information per oz. than the other books I examined."
3,"Good for a quick, India-inspired meal","This is very easy to use, just brown up 1-1/2 lbs. of diced chicken and simmer in the sauce for 15 min. We prefer it on basmati rice, and like a little yogurt or labna in the sauce. Pataks' sauce has a slightly sweet flavor, and is only a little spicy (the jar says hot, but it wasn't by our standards). We ate it with some chili relish and mango pickle, to kick it up a notch. Usually we use a dry mix for Rogan Josh by Shan, or make it from scratch and personally I prefer these better, but they take 2-3 hours. We also usually use beef, which I may try this with another time. For something fast and easy it certainly fits the bill."
2,Not for us,"My family loves eating curries, that is why I was surprised at how much we didn't like this one. It reminded me of a badly seasoned spaghetti sauce. Loaded with tomato sauce and not much else. It was edible, but not very enjoyable for us. We have tried other sauces made by this company and liked them, so I cannot say that the brand is totally bad. I prefer the spice pastes though because I can work with them more."
1,Not very good...,"...a real step down for Hilary after parting company with Sony...DG decides to pair her with the ""Swedish Radio Sympnony""?...to record Spohr??...the performances are okay but uninspired and the recorded sound is quite thin...a vastly superior Paganini can be heard on Michael Rabin's recording of it...and Spohr?...well, does anyone really care?...and at some point Hillary needs to realize that although her Vuillaume violin sounds nice it lacks depth and doesn't carry very well."
4,too boomy,"The violin playing is beautiful, but for you audiophiles, the bass sound is a little boomy."
3,NOTHING SPECIAL!,"I like Hilary Hahn, she is a terrific violinist. Maybe it's the way they record her, but all her recordings sound kinda wan, if not actually dull."
2,"Well, it depends on what you're looking for","I happened to listen to both concertos on the radio. Here is my opinion: technically, it's really, really good. Maybe too good sometimes. Musically, I have absolutely NO intention to listen to it again any time soon.However, just for the record, I do admire Miss Hahn as a violinist. Playing the fiddle is not an easy thing to do, folks."
5,Excellent,Hillary Hahn is wonderful. I love her work and enjoy listening to her as I work at home every chance I get. Her style is spirited and passionate.
2,"Oue, go away!","The orchestral ""support"" provided by Oue is downright wretched. Hahn is simply obscured by the constant boomy bass. This CD should be entitled the Paganini Drum Concerto."
3,Nice Try! Hilary,"I sincerely disagree with any of previous reviewers. I don't have much to write because I only listened the CD several times so far. Just a few cliche.First her bowing is too much concentrated on A & E. Not enough G & D and too much A & E, I guess. Also the orchestra's interpretation is too mechanical (This, you can not blame her.) It's just like dropping same glass bottles onto the concrete floor all the time. I can not say that they are not the world class one, but for the scores it just did not work. It seems beyond the matter of interpretations. Also Hilary Hahn has been downhill skiing ever since that Brahms VC, and i truly believe that it has nothing to do with the workmanship of recent part replacement. I think perhaps Maestro Maazel can teach a few of lost arts about bowing. Also do not try to find all the answers from your relationship with the instrument. Hey I am just trying to help here."
5,Great Artist -- great price,All Taschen artist books are so reasonably priced for the amount and quality of the art shown! This artist reminds me of Gaudi in philosophy and love of color and pattern.
2,Not a very good representation of a great master!,"I am a big fan of Hundertwasser, however when I rec'd this book today I was quite disappointed! There was almost NO photos of his amazing architectural subjects which I was mostly looking forward to viewing.Michael Locke, Editor""The Silver Lake News"""
3,What a Surprise!,"Jessa is excited when her grandmother gives her a trail ride vacation in the Canadian Rockies. But just as the trip begins, she feels sick and is always hungry or thirsty. Partway into the trail ride, she falls off her horse and wakes up in the hospital. There she learns that she has diabetes. Because the jacket touts this a ""recommended for children with diabetes,"" I expected a pedantic story that focused primarily on the problems Jessa faced in her life. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a fast-paced story about a summer holiday, friendships that change, and horseback riding. Readers who like horses, stories about friends, or just a good tale, will enjoy Return to Skoki Lake. They may also discover that a young girl with diabetes isn't that different from any other young person."
4,Fascinating soundtracks from 60s-70s German softcore films,"Excellent German orchestral and small combo rock 'n' roll from the soundtracks of German softcore films of the early 60s and 70s. Plenty of fuzzed out guitars (""make your guitar sound like a Sitar - the Voxx Wah-Wah, it's what's HAPPENING!"") Hammond organ, and wailing brass, complemented by snappy drums, bongos and other percussion. All tracks feature catchy riffs, many borrowed from the very best places (""Dirty Boy"" reminds me an awful lot of the theme from the Munsters, ""Title Theme"" has a harmonica that just might be the player from Canned Heat). Sighing vocals and softer horns provide the background for your home seduction scenes, while the upbeat cuts turn any room into a discoteque.Superb sound quality and a hefty 19 tracks make this a real bargain!"
4,Great sexy retro pop-jazz-rock!,"This is a great album. These instrumentals can be taken as perverse if you've seen the films that their from, but you can play it as the background soundtack to a classy retro get-together with wine and cheese. I can't believe how much the first track apes The Canned Heat's ""On the Road Again!"""
4,"If u Like Prince, U Gotta Get This!",The Universal Love Mix has alternate lyrics. They are better than the original! All the rest of the remixes of Space are Prince Funk at its best!
1,not for determined dogs,"This backseat barrier kept my dogs from coming up front for about one hour, until they figured out that they could just easily jump right over the top of it. This might work for a very little dog, or a car with an extremely low ceiling, or a dog that doesn't have much desire to make its way into the front seat, but I'm not sure why you would need this in the first place if your dog wasn't constantly trying to jump into the front while you are driving. I thought this was going to be the answer to all of my dog transporting problems, but it is just a waste of money."
3,Works OK - Best Suited for Vehicles with Removeable Headrests,Model shipped didn't match photo. Works OK - better suited (easier to install / remove) in vehicles with removeable head-rests.
1,Prt barrier,"My dog jumped right over the top. We have a very active shelty. Didn't use till we went on a trip, too late to return."
2,Barrier,"I had a hard time getting this to stay in place, my dog jumped right over it. It may have worked better on a vehicle with larger seats."
1,kurgo pet barrier,i did not like it the instructions were confusing and there were way too many pieces that looked alike
2,Great idea- Doesn't work,"We take our terrier everywhere in our Grand Cherokee. When we leave him in the car to job or eat, he hops in the front seat. He is a major shedder and likes to leave imprints on the car windows with his nose. This device was difficult to attach. It took a number of tries to find a way to fasten the lower parts. Biggest problem, however, was the ease with which our dog found ways to go through the barrier when we left him in the car. It worked well to prevent him from climbing onto the center console while we were driving."
3,Needs heavier hardware,Unfortunately 2 of the 4 clips needed to secure the barrier were broke. They are not heavy duty. After some modifications I was able to rig the barrier in place. It's not quite what I expected but it does the job. The material is heavy and I like that. It does keep my 5 dogs in place.
3,nice option for small cars,"We bought this to try in our Mini Cooper Clubman. We wanted to use it to keep the dog in the hatch area, not the backseat. You have to take the shelf out of the back to attach it, but you can put the shelf back on with no problems, leaving the barrier in place. (You can also use it as a backseat barrier without a problem.)The problem is that the top of the barrier only covers the space between the rear headrests; our dog can wriggle between the headrests and the window. If she was larger, or not prone to trying to escape the hatch, it would be fine. (She's about 40 lbs.)If your car is a different shape, it might work just fine for you, either in the backseat or in the hatch.The instructions are not the best-written I've ever run across, and the packaging is unpleasant to open. I ended up opening it with kitchen shears.(I posted a version of this review at dogcars.com.)"
1,Kurgo pet barrier too flimsy,"While the main portion of the barrier is well made, it's too short and flimsy to keep my Border Collies and Golden Retreiver from jumping on top and over it. The upper netting won't stay in an upright position, partially because the two stabilizer bars holding it up broke the stitching holding them in place, so they are now useless. Get the Outward Hound version for less than ten bucks and save some money."
3,Overpriced but effective,"There seem to be few choices in front seat barriers for pickup trucks. I have never seen one of these in a pet store in my area, and I looked everywhere. That probably explains the price. This one has been effective keeping my dogs out of the front seat. It was easy to install. The top part that looks like a window does not need to be installed if you have a small dog that won't try to jump over it. There are flat metal bars that slip down inside and provide stiffness and height. it seems pretty expensive for what it is. One of the cheap plastic hold down clips has already broken.Update: I called Kurgo and they happily shipped me a new plastic clip. They also were able to provide me an extender strap to allow me to fit the barrier into my new bigger truck. The people at Kurgo were friendly and helpful. I enjoyed working with them. Add a star."
2,doesn't work,this product is not only difficult to install it also doesn't work. My lab jumped over it with no problem. It just makes it harder to get him back in the back seat.
2,"Good, But Not Worth the Price","This book is way overpriced. For $45.00, one would expect a more in depth discussion of the Second Great Awakening and Trancendentalist Movement than a mere six chapters and twenty-two very brief biographies. Too expensive for its target audiance: the casual lay reader, and far too trivial for tha student or scholar."
3,Covers the basics but is repetitive and confusing.,The dos and don'ts lists are a good idea but Rowland gets quite repetitive and sometimes contradicts herself. She says don't invest in gold funds and then goes on to explain for 2 pages all about the nuances of gold funds. I think this book is not good for beginners but has many handy hints and tips for those with some familiarity with mutual fund investing.
4,Great fundamentals and starting point,"This is a great starting point for people who want to know more about investing, and particulary those who want to do it themselves. Rowland packs a lot of useful investing do's and don't, with easy to follow explanations. She stresses the key concepts such as asset and risk allocation, dollar-cost-averaging, and ""buy low, sell high"" (which, although a cliché, is often ignored). She examines all kind of mutual funds, from stocks, to bonds, to gold, to blend. One drawback is the book is about 3 years old, which hurts the information a little. However, this book can provide investing knowledge that applies any time, whether you believe in the ""New Economy"" or not."
2,Did not fit Sprint,"This did not fit my 1987 Chevy Sprint 1.0L Turbo. It has both male ends, while the Sprint has one male and one female."
1,It's Cr***py Time Dear Dragon,Here is the book.The book is cr***py.Cr***py. Cr***py. Cr***py.You must read it.Over and over.How bad for you. How bad for you.Do not do that.I did not write this review so you could do that.Come back here with me and read this review.At this spot you will read the review.It is not a pretty one.How bad for you. How bad for you.
2,"Actaully, it is mostly not very funny.",I do hope he keeps trying. I'm sure someday he will learn how to write funny ones too!
1,Unacceptable At,"The book arrived in unacceptable condition--frayed cover, underlinings, and pages pulled away from spine, making it unuseable.Refund was made promptly upon complaint, but this book should never have been offered for sale."
2,i had such high hopes...,"no doubt like many of you, i had high hopes for this album after hearing the four on the floor and short music for short people tracks by enemy you. i even didn't mind waiting three weeks or so for the delayed release. what i got, however, was repetitive-even-for-punk melodies, a total absence of energy, and lyrics so pretentious they were better suited for hippie poetry readings. after school special (the band's precursor) was fun poppy-punk, and ok, if dave wanted to get serious, more power to him. but there's gotta be some variety, both of style and subject. where are the songs about chicks? is kelly burkett no longer a psycho?"
3,Solid Beginning,"While I have to agree that the plot just wasn't there, I think Mimi has a lot of potential yet to be realized. I personally found her very entertaining in the action sequences, but did not find the film to be putting her ability to good use. Better to put her skills to good use in a supporting role in a higher budget flick opposite people who can make the fight scenes believable."
3,Solid Try,"While I have to agree that the plot just wasn't there, I think Mimi has a lot of potential yet to be realized. I personally found her very entertaining in the action sequences, but did not find the film to be putting her ability to good use. Better to put her skills to good use in a supporting role in a higher budget flick opposite people who can make the fight scenes believable."
1,"Mimi is very sexy, but ...","Mimi Lesseos is a very attractive and appealing woman, but this film has budget basement written all over it. The acting is wooden, the script looks like it was written on the fly, and I think most people wouldn't even want to rent this movie. Sorry, Mimi!"
3,African pop fails to involve listener,"Reading about Samite's survival of Idi Amin's regime and the explanation for each track, I wanted to like this CD more. It's African pop that is not bad but not involving either."
2,Arrived Broken in pieces,"The chalk is great, but the packaging allowed almost every piece of chalk to break in shipping."
1,Not New,The Chalk broken and the box was torn. It did not come in the packaging in the picture. That would be find if this box did not look used. It had a very poor appearance. Very disappointed.
4,view from an enlisted man,Very interesting read. It is written by an enlisted man and gives a whole different prespective of what life was like for WWII German Uboat sailors.
4,"Steel Boat, Iron Hearts",Excellent insight to what the German U Boat crews did and their thinking during the operations... enough technical information to allow you to better understand what they went thru but not so much as to bore you. It was an awfultime and after reading this you can better understand just how horrible the U Boat war was and the terrible lossesit had.
3,"Steel Boat, Iron Hearts","Cannot write a review, as I haven't had a chance to read it yet.I have visited the Museum in Chicago where this U-Boat is permanently displayed"
3,Fair-to-Middling,"I had read Iron Coffins, which I thought so good that it was hard to put down. Looking for more of the same, I tried Steel Boat, Iron Hearts and was somewhat disappointed. My complaint in brief is that it failed to engage me, and I found it unremarkable. Perhaps its main flaw in my eyes is that it didn't come close to matching Iron Coffins as a story or as a narrative."
4,Very informative,"Gives you an insight into what life was like onboard a U-boat during WWII. As the war went on, life becameharder and harder."
4,Fascinating tale,"Rarely can we read of the unbelievable trials endured by our enemy, like we can in this s book. I admire the author's honesty, which is believable."
3,Interesting but a bit disturbing,"The late Hans Goebeler's memoir of life on a U-Boot during WWII is fascinating but a bit disturbing. Despite having moved to the US at some point to spend the rest of his life near his beloved U-505, he appears to have never lost his conviction that German sailors we fighting for a noble cause.All in all, it's a fascinating read if you don't mind the occasional side trip into apologies for the lost German struggle ""against Bolshevism."""
3,A Young Sailor's Wartime Story,"A fascinating view of the lives of the young men of the U-boat service as it transitioned from jubilant near-victory to perilous defeat. It is a well-researched, historically factual glimpse of a grim and dangerous profession. What it lacks is a greater insight into the feelings of the men around which the account is set. We do not ride, to any great extent, the roller coaster of emotions that must have attended the events described. We see men of steel in an iron boat."
2,German Military(Nazi's),"I chose this book because it was a naval story and about the hardship and togetherness is felt on board all Naval vessels. However, it showed the Nazi image that was so powerful a force in Germany. The author, a Hitler youth, and believer in the salvation of Hitler for the father land. The schools attended demanding the loyalty, the emptiness of mind, the willingness to conform to the German Military Nazi organizations. The Nazi staunch teachings are evident in this book no matter how the author tried, it still showed in his belief,actions,and his lack of not showing France as an Occupied country, not a defeated one. The German Navy and its submarine service, although kind enough to help survivors, was ruthless in its endeavors."
3,U Boats,"The book provided a fair insight into the life of a submariner during the period of engagement which was the subject of the book, I personally would have liked to know more about the authors life after as reading the book. One gained a reasonable insight to who Hans Groebeler was yet, although not a bigrophy it left a lot about the life of Hans in the US, his family etc untouched."
5,"Steel Boat, Iron Hearts","I have read many many submarine books. I rate this one as one of the best of the best.Writen from a crew member's perspective who served under three different commanders about life as a U-boat crewmen.The writer pulls no punches when talking about fighting for Nazi Germany. Why and how he felt about Hitler. Lots of in debth detail about life on shore leave including the details about the night life ... and all the details with whores, French countrymen, French resistence, Army Core and what it was like during the air raids of their sub pens. Not to mention the war patrols and being captured.A real, no BS account from the sounds of it. Absolutely loved it."
4,U Boat service was tough,This little book makes life in the Kriegsmarin come alive and makes it sound as horrible as it must have truly been. An engaging little book with bits of insight into the thinking of the German fighting sailor.
4,Excellent read,Real insight into WWII from a German perspective. Excellently writtem although the author was quite a bit defensive. Other accounts of U-505 show a different side to the crew and worth looking up for anyone interested in the U-Boat campaign. Highly recommended.
4,"Steel Boat, Iron Hearts: The Wartime Saga of Hans Goebeler and U-505",I rated this novel 4 stars because it was a very detailed account of a submariner who wrote about his actual experience of going into combat on a U-Boat during World War II and dealing with all his trials and triumphs in a very honest manner.
4,Sea war from the enemies stantpoint,This will give you the perspective of the enemy sailor you may not have had before. A real interesting book on the period of WWII history.
3,Review Steel boats and Iron hearts,"From the start I am a fan of non fiction first person accounts of warfare. This was a great read,it did (I feel) go into a bit too much reminising of his childhood prior to WW2. Again the author seemed to brush over the training regime he underwent. The nuts and bolts of day to day life in a underseaboot was fascinating, the book abruptly e ds with his capture, with a few remarks about his treatment, then again did he expect 'hero' staus by his American capturers, when he readilly admits to sinking thousands of tons of shipping. All and all a good read not as graphic as Guy Sager's The Forgotten Soldier, but a good addition to your war non fiction collection. Read February 2013"
3,A Little Disappointing,I expected more action (encounters with Allied shipping). The book got a wee bit boring with all of the onshore activities.
3,Nice memorial,This is a nice remembrance of military service during WW2. But it is pretty self glorifying and a little too dismissive of the aggressive roll of the fatherland in that conflict.
2,Haven't I already read this?,"Too much of the same thing. No development of characters, and the same plot devices. The story is not good enough without this."
4,Decent story,"Good book! Not as action packed as I have seen books. Deals with politics of the characters more than I like to hear about, but still a good read."
1,The Worst,"The lame title is however appropriate. And you thought ""Tourist Attraction"" or ""The Brain of Colonel Barham"" was bad!Puts me to sleep everytime I attempt to watch it!"
5,classic vocals,"for those who like non-rock vocals, the tail end of the pop era, this collection from time life is for you."
1,The Jerk (HD DVD),"I hate this movie because I was not able to view it. Amazon sent me a DVD that required reprogramming of my Sony player, a DVD player that easily plays my more than 100 collection of DVD's, many purchased from Amazon. Why mail a DVD to a good customer, that the customer cannot view? If I had been able to view the DVD I would have most likely rated it four star, I remember it as Steve Martin's first and best."
1,Embarrassing and stupid,"Good parts: That really is Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry playing music at the beginning and the end of the movie. Seriously awesome.Bad parts: Pretty much everything else. Silly and surreal, yes, but funny, no. Moronic and embarrassing, and clearly a vehicle intended to show Steve Martin at his most frenetic. He's much better in his later, toned-down movies that actually rely on humor and not just stupidity, trawling for cheap laughs."
5,HYSTERICALLY FUNNY!!!!!,THIS IS A FUNNY MOVIE. THIS IS A FUNNY MOVIE ABOUT STEVE MARTIN GROWING UP IN A BLACK FAMILY. LATER ON HE LEAVES AND GOES ON HIS OWN AND MAKES A BETTER LIFE FOR HIMSELF AND BECOMES FILTHY RICH AND THEN BECOMES POOR AGAIN. BERNADETTE PETERS IS ONE OF HIS CO-STARS AND SHE FALLS IN LOVE WITH HIM. AND HE HAS A DOG NAMED STUPID. THIS MOVIE IS SO FUNNY I LOVE IT IT IS A MUST HAVE IF YOU LIKE STEVE MARTIN THEN YOU WOULD LIKE THIS MOVIE!!!!
3,No need to sell your old copy . . .,"In terms of the extras that come with this ""special edition"" of THE JERK, if you already own the film there is nothing compelling you to sell your existing copy and buy this. But as someone who saw THE JERK at the movies 26 years ago, it has held up well. The jokes are still funny and you can't accuse Steve Martin of offering too few of them.Watching this D.V.D. of THE JERK, I realized a couple of things I had fogotten. Steve Martin was in great shape in those days. And Bernadette Peters was shapely to the point of distraction. Towards the end of THE JERK, Ms. Peters sports a low-cut top and a midriff-baring dress that make it difficult to concentrate on the movie."
3,Which is BETTER?,"Is this FULL Coverage UNCUT film? The 26th Anniversary Edition has BETTER quality in picture and sound, but they CUT off 10 min worth of scene. WHY????? I hope this ORIGINAL not so well made DVD is atleast UNCUT?"
3,Stupid Funny,"Generally moronic, but funny as a result. Like, who would conjur up ""the only white kid in a black sharecropper family?"" Some lines that are classics, as, ""...that's all I need... Just this chair.... and this waffle maker... and that's ALL I NEED .... this chair and this wafflemaker.. and that's ALL I NEED... and this..."" Good for a yuck or two."
4,Memories,"This was our first date movie, nearly 33 yrs ago. Funny movie and enjoyed it. A bit racy at times, for back in the day but Steve Martin is hilarious"
2,the jerk hd dvd,I didn't realize it wouldn't work on my old dvd player that is not hd so I gave it away.
1,ONCE AGAIN UNIVERSAL RUINS ANOTHER DVD RELEASE,I have really come to the end of my rope concerning Universal DVD releases. Why hasnt this film been cleaned up and at least out out on a widescreen format? Their is no excuse for this. They are by far the biggest and the worse dvd distributor in the market. They continually release dvd after dvd with framing errors-no digital transfers-no extra features---grainy dirty negatives without any concern about preserving these films. Its pathetic.To add to all of this they will release these films then pull them over and over again how many more re-releases of one film can you produce?Why? your not adding anything but new crappy artwork for the cover.Whens the last time the original cut of the Blues Brothers has seen the day of light??Now The Jerk is also among your lame releases. GREAT film HORRIBLE release done by the worst in the biz. Simply put UNIVERSAL SUCKS.
2,lacking special purpose,"I hadn't seen The Jerk in at least ten years and was really looking forward to revisiting this movie. I wasn't concerned about commentary or other extras, but I was seriously disappointed when Navin starts excitedly shouting about discovering his ""special purpose"" and I realized that the memorable scene where his adopted father tells him for the first time about his ""special purpose"" is NOT INCLUDED.While other deleted scenes and dialogue simply robbed purchasers of this video of laughs, the deletion of this key scene actually robs the movie of sense. Why was it removed? Glad I only paid $5.99 for this because I ended up donating it to Goodwill. Hopefully another edition with all of the footage included will eventually be released."
2,Universal can BLOW me,Another anniversary issue of a beyond classic film and Universal just takes a dump on the consumer. Marginally better transfer and few extras. We deserve better Universal....so shame on you.
3,May the farce be with you...,"As silly as it gets, ""The Jerk"" is still full of classic comedic moments in film, and as such, deserves to be given its proper due. But as stated by one of the previous reviewers, it would have been a killer DVD with some more extras, as well as the letterboxing format.Not that this is an especially *visual* film, but with so many lesser films on the market getting better treatment upon initial DVD release, I would have figured that even the '03 SERIOUS Steve Martin would have the impetus to make sure that this (one of his biggest films) was handled properly.Nevertheless, it's a great film, with a lot of laughs, particularly comedy great Jackie Mason and Martin himself, who's in top form. To this day, I still hold no great love for Carl Reiner's brand of comedy, much less his skills as a director, but this film is the goods."
1,RIP Off - Anniversary Edition - Not truly WS,"I owned the 1999 DVD release of the Jerk (1.33:1 Aspect Ratio) and this 26th year anniversary is nothing but a wide screen pan and scan of this version. If it wasn't for the fact that I rented this movie and didn't buy it I would of been trying to find out who the fool at Universal decided to make this decision.I haven't seen the HD version but I wouldn't be surprise if universal utilized the 1.33:1 DVD and just pan scan with wide screen to resell it.For those that own this Anniversary Issue, I would seek a refund from Universal. They should write everyone a check by hand, just like Nathan Johnson had to do in the movie."
4,What about the Sound?,I have the orginal DVD and the sound quality is awful. The volume level changes throughout the film. I want to know if the new DVD has solved this problem before putting out more money for a movie that I already own. Thanks.
2,"Book review: The Jerk, published by Warner Books","The Jerkis an entertaining movie, particularly if you evolved withSteve Martinthroughout his career. Many people don't know that he is also an author, writing books likeCruel ShoesandThe Pleasure of My Company.So here is what The Jerk - the book - is and is not.It's not the screenplay (a real disappointment... this was my expectation, since the screenplay WAS written by Steve Martin).It's not a true reflection of the movie (there are little quips and jabs throughout, in addition to the screen shots and some quotes).It's not a great reminder of the movie.What this book is, is a little souvenir book. It's not the best overview of the movie (like you would find with the bookConeheads: The Life and Times of Beldar Conehead : As Told to Gorman Seedling, Ins Commissioner, Retired. No hidden production gems, and no ""the rest of the Navin R. Johnson story"" material.Disappointing."
4,Steve Martin at His Best,"I probably can't count how many times I've seen this film, although I'd been away from it for a while before watching it recently. I was surprised to find that unlike many other very funny movies, THE JERK was actually much funnier than I'd remembered.Watching Martin's comedic acting in this rags-to-riches-to-rags tale, one can't help but come to the understanding that this performance is a stroke of genius. The writing is sound, the gags still work, and Bernadette Peters is luminously funny as Martin's love interest.The DVD rates only 4 stars, however, because it's sadly lacking in features. I've rented or borrowed this one twice, but I don't plan to buy it until a better, more feature-packed edition is released. Although the trailer is fun to watch, I'd much rather have outtakes, commentary, and interviews to go along with what may be Steve Martin's most classic film."
4,Scenes missing in DVD Too!,"This is not the MOVIE that gets 4 stars, its the published DVD. Why in the world they have missing scenes even in the DVD version is beyond my comprehension. I just saw the TV version the other day and realized that even more footage than I had previously thought is just simply not in the movie, and the DVD has virtually no extra content at all other than cast bios. This movie is just a pure classic, and why they would tear it apart in the DVD publication is a mystery that deserves an answer!"
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this DVD for my sister as a birthday gift after reading all the great reviews about it, and felt horribly ashamed of getting it after watching the DVD when she got it. My sister is a huge Steve Martin fan and found the movie barely funny after the first couple of scenes...If you're looking for a great Steve Martin movie, ""My Blue Heaven"", ""Parenthood"", or ""The Three Amigos"" are MUCH better choices!"
2,Not that bad but martin's done better,"This movie is too inaccurate and revolves around different storylines leaving it to be too annoying and the different charecters in this movie like, the dad and the police, what the hell are they doing in this movie, not too much detail put into this movie, worst cast in the world and bad coustumes. 3.5/10."
1,Not for Kids,"I thought I was buying the original funny movie I saw in the late 70's, but I was shocked and disappointed at the bad language and suggestive scenes that weren't part of the movie I knew and loved. I turned it off and threw it in the trash. I'm just glad my kids weren't in the room."
4,Classic Steve Martin funny,First half great... runs out of steam a little later on but worth a watch! Lots of well known names.
2,An oldie not a goodie,"Personally, I hated the movie. Yes, it was funny-ish, but the humor was almost exclusively at the expense of the cleanliness of the plot. In short, it was a dirty movie. The plot, in which a young abandoned Steve Martin is raised by a stereotyped Negro family in the deep South, leaves home, makes millions on an accidental ""invention,"" is sued, loses everything and then is picked up by his family and goes back to where he was, is weak at best. Anyway, I would not recommend this and I will never watch it again. It was, very simply, plain stupid."
5,A Favorite,I couldn't find a copy of The Jerk at any of the local retail outlets. I was surprised to find a copy with such ease and also a great price. I love the movie and couldn't be more pleased.
1,The Jerk DVD,"I find it very difficult to rate this DVD due to the fact that I am unable to view it! Apparently it is a ""bad disc"" and it will not play in my DVD player! I have had great success with Amazon in the past so I found no need to keep the packing slip or info that came along with the DVD. Therefore, I am unable to return it."
5,Can't go wrong.,You can't go wrong with Steve Martin and the Jerk is an all time classic. I must buy or any comedy buff. Great one liners!
3,"I'M SORRY,BUT THIS IS NOT MARTINS BEST BY A LONG SHOT!","First I want to point out that I like Steve Martin! I just don't think this film is that funny. He has been much funnier even in recent years. The jokes fall flat and some of them are just plain dumb! I know I may offend a lot of Martin fans who adore this movie,but I just don't get it.......sorry! I would have rated this 2 1/2 stars if possible."
5,"EAT MY SHORTS, AFI","The American Film Institute committed the biggest injustice since Jackie O used her status as first lady to make the pillbox hat fashionable when they rated The Jerk #89 in the 100 funniest movies of all time. The Jerk is easily in the top 5 funniest movies ever made and is arguably the funniest. This is a movie that starts out with Steve Martin delivering the funniest line in the history of film: ""I was raised a poor Black child."" Hilarity ensues when he learns he isn't an African American and embarks on a journey to find his ""special purpose."" This was Steve Martin's first movie and is at least equally as funny as Planes Trains, and Automobiles. If you like Steve Martin you will like The Jerk. This was the first movie I bought when I got a DVD player. I got The Jerk and The Birdcage. Buy both movies, they are must haves for anyone with a DVD player or VCR."
4,Great Movie....Lackluster DVD,Why did they bother to release a new version of the DVD and STILL not include the deleted scenes from the television version. I want to see Navin sick after riding the Tilt-A-Whirl 87 times! I want to see the pilot plead for a donation from Navin to get his airplane seats repaired so his passengers won't have to sit on towels.....sniff Don't get me wrong....It is A GREAT movie....definitely an all-time comedy classic and a good quality DVD but no extras! That's all I want....
4,A Classic,This movie is still as good now as it was way back when. I love how stupid The Jerk is what a simpleton.
1,"Why is there no ""ZERO"" star category?","What a rip off. The recipes in this book seem like they were ripped right out of the pages of Ladies Home Journal. And what's up ladies? Is that what happened? I mean, you can get better, simpler, tastier recipes than this online without having to buy the book. As for the rest of the stuff that the book says, I agree with other reviewers that there is nothing new here. Nothing at all. It's as though it were written by someone taking a writing class for the first time. ""Okay class, we are going to write about what's in our refrigerator. I'm going to need your composition to be 1000 words and you're going to talk about what might be in a refrigerator if you were trying to eat more healthy foods."" It's blather. If one needs something like this to be healthier, they have many other issues that should be addressed first."
1,Not worth the paper it's written on,"I read the book, came to this site to write a review, and was flabbergasted by the people that wrote positive reviews. Had they never encountered dietary information before? Was this their first knowledge of how food is processed in the body, and what foods one should eat? Even if that were the case, there are still better guides available. I found this book to be a cheap attempt to earn a little money at the expense of people wanting serious nutritional information. Maybe the positive reviews really were written by friends or by the author's own public relations firm...which advocates napping...induced by reading his own book no doubt."
1,If we lost any weight at all it was because of the laughter,"So four of us bought this at the office and we were all going to try it together. Like I said, if we lost any weight at all it was because this farce was trying to take itself seriously. I admit that I do most of my eating out, but I do know how to cook and even as a dilettante in the kitchen, I know that you have to be generally precise with some of the ingredients unless you're going to ruin the dish. Is it that hard to follow a recipe for what you like? Not if you're going to cook anyway. I feel like reading some of these reviews that I've been to a self-help forum where everyone walked out with the power except me. Then I noticed that most of the positive reviews were from Chicago, and I figured my group had just been tricked by the author's friends."
5,A Must Read Before You Eat Again,"This is the first book I've read that doesn't suggest that a radical overhall is required to eat healthier. The authors' tips are practical and achieveable, not just for eating better, but for living better. I wish I had this book ten years ago, before I added the extra pounds I am now trying to shed."
5,The perfect song,"As if this song could get any better. It is smoooth, and has catchy lyrics ""PLease Stay....Who knows when we'll meet again, who knows where we we'll be, after tonight"" it is amazing. A love ballad of sorts, or a one night stand! This is in my top 10 songs. Amazing.. Jason Prof DJ"
3,Could be better,"Not the strongest track on the Light Years album. Although it is a nice little poppy number the remixes are lacking in imagination (and most of the vocals) and are really for the most hardened of fans. Stick with CD1 for the new tracks, or buy the album if you haven't already!"
2,Disappointing,"I have loved all of Trapidos books. When I saw this in the bookstore, I picked it up, reread Temple of Delight, and started in on this. Very disappointing. She makes the same mistakes many writers make when writing a sequel - too much summarizing and explaining plot points in the last book, too many loose ends tied up, too many coincidences.If you want to read her work, go for Temples of Delight or Brother of the More Famous Jack. Those shine as her best. This one you can pass on."
2,"Cute clock, but sounds don't work","I am a huge lover of Halloween, and leave many Halloween decorations up year round, so when I saw this clock I obviously wanted it. I finally got it yesterday, put brand new batteries in it, and when I first tested it, the ghost sound worked. I set it up in my room and then realized an hour had gone by, and it didn't make any sounds like it's supposed to at the top of the hour. I tried moving the batteries around, and I even got another 3 brand new batteries out of the package just to be positive it wasn't the batteries problem, and still nothing. I tried pressing the button multiple times, and no sound ever comes out. Every hour rolls by without a sound, which sucks. I am still going to keep the clock because I like the way that it looks, but i'm very disappointed that it doesn't make the sounds"
2,Kind of dissapointed!,"It only has two sounds. Some horrible high pitched screaming cat. And a Ghost. There are so many different scary sounds, you'd think they could come up with 12."
4,a must have,this is a must have for every halloween fan eather in october or not this is a clock that will be up all year round except x-mas when the other goes up...boy i love the holidays....my fiance will love this clock
3,Halloween Clock,"Received the clock today. I wish the face were a little brighter, there's not a lot of contrast on the face - the pumpkins could have been a brighter orange, they're a little difficult to see from a distance. There are only 2 scary sounds - the mad scientist cackle and the groaning ghost. The 2 sounds are great but I wish there were more sounds. Unlike some other sound clocks (birds, carols, etc) where you recognize the time by the birdsong/carol (for example, the dove coo is 7 o'clock); with only 2 sounds you only know it's an even numbered or odd numbered hour. The clock has a light sensor that softens the sounds in a dimly lit room and shuts off the sounds in a dark room. I haven't had it long enough to tell, but with just 2 sounds, I'm afraid we may possibly grow weary. The clock is okay but not as great as I expected."
4,Good Halloween addition,"I love sound clocks and Halloween so when I saw this clock I had to get it! I love it! I do agree with one other review that there should be more sounds than just the 2 because there are so many scary sounds that could be on this clock, but other than that, it's perfect! The cat one makes me jump almost any time when I don't realize it's almost the top of the hour!"
1,Needs volume control,"We thought these were the other ""night vision"" goggles by Wild Planet, which my son had tried on, and liked.This item gets one star because the 'earbud' did nothing but give off high-pitched very loud feedback noises. My ears were ringing after trying to get it to work. There was no volume control, so if a kid has it in their ear and a dog barks nearby or the feedback persists, I worry that it could damage their hearing. If it had volume control, I'd give it 2.5-3 stars."
3,Ambush Valley,"Interesting film starring Bob Custer. Picture is fuzzy, indicative of the quality of the trandfer source quality."
2,Triple Ball Mount Pictured in chrome,"I purchased this product that stated chrome and as you see in the picture it is all chrome, well when I received this item only the ball was chrome unlike the picture shows the mount and all in chrome! Could have purchased the same thing I received cheaper from anther site."
1,Not correct description,"The item photo shows a chrome ball mount with a 6"" drop. The item sent was a black ball mount with a 3"" drop. I would suggest cross referencing the item needed with B&W's webite."
5,B&W Tow Stow Receiver Hitch - Triple Ball Mount,"Great item, clean design, easy to use. Nice to know one is prepared to tow most any trailer out there.I also bought the Master Lock 1480DAT Stainless Steel Receiver Lock to protect this investment."
1,Emergent or Divergent? You Decide If This Compromisology Can Be Taken Seriously,"I'm finishing up my master's degree while working with campus ministry. A friend loaned me the set and asked me to evaluate whether NKOC X 3 measures up to serious research and Bible standards of Jesusian truthstatus.I was going to give an extensive review of the too-numerous deficiencies and internal contradictions, but in reading the other reviews for the separate volumes, looks like the ground's been pretty well covered in prose.That leaves the poetic short-version:COMPROMISOLOGYSo this is Jesus's emergent church?Souls need baked salmon, yet are served poached perchFilched while (unlicensed) on divergent's lurch!"
5,One-time Purchase Meant To Last,"After losing my entire LP collection in 2005 (the big ""K"" hurricane), replacing those rare albums has been a challenge. An even bigger challenge has been what do I do with them when I finally locate and purchase the replacement? I was looking for something compact and portable. Something I could pick up, put in my car, and evacuate if need be. I purchased a couple of other cases but neither were exactly what I was looking for or what these LPs deserve. Then, I found this product by Odyssey, ordered it, and am so glad that I did."
2,exploitation elements,"I've seen two or 30 Franco films, but this has Flesh for the Beast / Werewolf Woman / Nightmares Come at Night, I liked Flesh for the Beast, but really disliked Nightmares Come at Night, and Werewolf Woman, so I thought I'd buy some of his titles that have a bigger following.Well, positive following makes for a fallacious description.I still need to pick up Exorcism and Venus in Furs.These titles are kinda Vampyros Lesbos and more slasher genre than anything, fused with all the exploitation elements that make up a typical inadequate Jess Franco film.Bad collection but you can't go wrong with Hammer and Peter Cushing."
2,Werewolf Woman,"A sheltered rape victim begins dreaming that she is transforming into a wolf by nightfall. It isn't long before dead bodies start turning up all around her, but is she truly becoming a bloodthirsty beast, or is it all in her head? Rino di Silvestro takes a brilliant concept and drags it through the 1970's Eurotrash gutter. The plot consistently falls secondary to the heightened sexuality at every point throughout the film. There are moments where the twist on the lycanthropic theme does shine through, however. The wolf resembles all of the primal urges that Daniela has been trying to repress, which manifest themselves as violence and rage when she becomes aroused. Unfortunately, WEREWOLF WOMAN is poorly acting and overly dramatic, and what is worse is that every attempt at eroticism is spoiled by Annik Borel's old, sagging body and complete lack of sex appeal. Outside of a few gory moments and plenty of nudity, there is very little to watch for here.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,NOT A WEREWOLF MOVIE,"The only interesting thing about this movie is that the DVD jacket is reversible. I had never seen that before. This only means is that you can have two different covers of a bad movie.This movie is about a delusional woman who thinks she's a werewolf. There is one dream-like scene at the beginning where she transforms into a...a...a really shoddy looking werewolf. After that nothing but a psychological case study. I gotta tell you I fell asleep shortly after the beginning and woke to an incesant hammering. In that half awake state I couldn't get the hammering out of my head. I thought I was going insane. I woke and knew the hammering was in the movie, but that I my sanity was still in question because there was still 20 minutes left."
2,werewolf woman... no it is a insane woman....,"It talks about the werewolf, but there is only one scene, which a woman became a wolf at the beginning of the film. I thought that this film is the werewolf movie when I saw the title of this film, but there is no werewolf woman. There is only insane woman who kills people ridiculously. The woman kills people because her ancestor, who was a werewolf, appears and manipulates her to kill people. In addition, she has a memory that she was raped when she was young. After that, she has a terror about the male and also has a disgusting feeling about sex. So, she kills people when they have sex or they are related to sexual actions. The scenes of murder are crude, and bombastic performance as well. I think that this film is trying to explain the poor insane woman why she killed people. However, it is not convincing. On the contrary, it goes to the crudeness."
1,One song extended with terrible singing,This ain't pretty and shouldn't even be bought by anybody. If you hear Bob Mould's singing through all the guitar noise you wouldn't be surprised - it doesn't sound good and sounds so laboured and forced. The guitars are good for 1 track but when there's little variation in them there's not a lot else you can admire in them. I tried New Day Rising as well and Mould's voice still sounds so forced. Avoid although if you are determined to buy something of this nature I'd suggest Sonic Youth's Confusion is Sex/Kill Yr Idols - it has a bit more bite to it
4,Sum up of the early years pulls it off.,"For those who start off with the more polished hardcore of Zen Arcade or the poppier alternative of New Day Rising, this is a bit of a shock, to hear that these guys were at one point REALLY hardcore. But it lays the foundation for their later stuff, and gives us the chance to rock out with harder Bob Mould (if we are already fans of his solo and less hardcore Sugar). The title track and ""In A Free Land"" are worth the price of purchase alone. Get this if you are already in the know about Du.....(and even if you're not)"
3,Not quite there yet,"Back in 1980-1982 HD was a rather angry little hardcore unit. Only little of their melodic abilities is evident on this album, but the uncompromising attitude and energy is still convincing. Tracks like ""From The Gut"", ""Everything Falls Apart"" and ""Gravity"" prove that they were on the right tracks. But really it is the ""...and more""- part of the record that really makes this a must. Sure, there's no comparison to Metal Circus -EP, for example, but many of the extra tracks are rather good indeed, especially ""In A Free Land"", ""Amusement"" and ""Do You Remember?"". Plus, isn't it, after all, interesting to hear the early stuff of a band with such significanse."
4,Ouch,"This CD'll make ya cringe all right. Absolutely brutal, and unrelentingly so. That's good, because the classics they made later (Mr. Amazon: only two of the five classic Husker albums were on a major label) would combine this thrash energy with some stellar pop hooks, (so what if that's what everybody always says about Husker Du, it's true).Still, there is some good stuff here. If you like this group, you've gotta have this for ""In A Free Land."" Metal Circus may be where everyone says they started to shy away from the ""hardcore"" approach (frankly, though, even Warehouse is a little hardcore), but that song is certainly the first of the classics these guys gave us. It's also one of the few political songs we heard from them. Tracks 7-14 are all pretty decent as well, but most of the rest go by in a samish sounding blur. NOT the place to start with this band, but has some good moments for fans."
5,Huskers finest hour,"For all of those who think Husker Du's best material didn't come until Zen Arcade or any of those horrible albums(Candy Apple Grey, Warehouse:Songs and Stories, basically anything after Metal Circus), and there are a lot of them, then you probably won't like this and you're a sad pop music lover. However, if you liked Land Speed Record(a classic), or any of the bands early singles, then get this quick, 'cause it kills. Every song is a gem of classic midwest HC vintage. Classics like the title track, blah blah blah, In A Free Land, aaaaahhhhh the whole cd is perfect. No jangly pop-punk here, just thick guitars, Bob and Grant screaming with soul burning conviction, and non-stop high speed thrashin', complete with extra tracks from early singles and a coupla unreleased tunes, this is a GREAT example of what Husker Du was capable of before New Day Rising, when it all started to really go downhill. Get this and play loud!!!!"
3,Better than Land Speed Record,"If you are curious about Husker Du, I would recommend buying ""Metal Circus"" or anything recorded after that. However, if you are interested in the band's formative years, this collection should satisfy. It basically consists of better-than-average (""From The Gut"", ""Blah, Blah, Blah"", ""In A Free Land"", ""Everything Falls Apart""), average (""Wheels"", ""Target"", ""Let's Go Die""), and totally forgetable (""Punch Drunk"", ""Bricklayer"", ""Statues"") early-eighties hardcore. By the time ""Zen Arcade"" was recorded, Bob and Grant had matured considerably as songwriters. However, even if Husker Du's later material far outdistances the music on this collection, it's still worth adding to your collection, in my opinion."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,Very entertaining!!! You will love this tape. Extremely valuable for your life.You want to have this information! John Gray should be Sainted!!!
4,The spirit of adventure,"It's great to catch up with these characters and stories after nearly twenty years.They are still fun stories, and I find the lack of violence and the innocence of them charming in a world that now seems drunk with violent stories for both kids and adults.If you're new to the famous five, then this will be a great discovery for you and a journey you will want to continue."
5,My childhood books :),"I read and enjoyed these books when I was a child. Even if many years have passed (i have somehow lost my copies), the stories have remained vividly on my mind. I just had to have them again! Like the other reviewer said, copies are hard to find here in the US. I got mine from Australia (Magic Faraway Tree, Folk of the Faraway Tree and Enchanted Wood). I have re-read them all, and once again brought back happy childhood memories. I will definitely read these books to my kids someday, hoping that they will enjoy it as much as I did. :)"
5,Excellent children's storybook!,"Bright, fun, amazingly illustrated.I highly recommond this book for children of all ages!"
3,Where's the anger?.......but its still good.,"""Rock and roll killing machine"" for me was their best release,as the songs were so directionless and confusing as each song was pact with amazing, original riffs that didnt seem to bore me after a couple of listens. Sadly i feel the ""still loves you"" e.p. has lost that crazyness, and has gone with more straight forward song structures. The riffs are not as original and the anger seems to have been deadend somewhat. However try and block you mind from their previous releases and you still have a cd thats worth listening to. ""Surveillence footage highlights"" seems to incorperate some good riffs and the anger from ""rock and roll"" seems to return for the last line, ""say my name like its all youve got!!!"".Definatly the highlight of the e.p."
4,Entertaining and Historical,Very good history lesson on the life and times of PT Barnum wrapped in an entertaining story. Gets a little long and dragged out in spots but you can always skip ahead!
1,Not terribly accurate,"Sorry to disagree with the majority of reviewers, but the historic accuracy of this production is very poor. The plot includes ""facts"" from Barnum's life that were created by one of Barnum's lifetime enemies. Read Arthur Saxon's ""P. T. Barnum: The Legend and the Man"" if you want to know what Barnum was really like."
4,Could be Much Longer,"The labels on the 'P.T. Barnum' DVD disc and holder are deceiving. Through most of the first part, I thought I was getting a version with most of the `good stuff' removed to save space and make it more family oriented. Not to worry. The whole 180 minutes are there. There was much history involved in this story that I felt that it could be twice as long. None-the-less, I would highly recommend this made for TV production for the whole family."
5,Boy o' boy.......,Seems like Paul Oakenfold and Fat Boy Slim need to attend The S.U.N. Project College. These three German fellows and their music will knock your socks off. Listen to the Tribolus and you are hooked. Money well spend.
3,China Rose,"The movie itself was disappointing. No complaints about the service provided getting this to me - was quick, the movie was in perfect condition."
2,Building the Machine by Glenn Hughes,"Glenn Hughes is my favourite rock vocalist but I can't understand why he put out a funky soul album rather than heavy rock like ""Addiction"" and ""Return of the Crystal Karma"" I am very disappointed. I prefer the fast and heavy guitar sound, with the heavy rock Glenn Hughes vocals."
4,Solid Stuff,"All in all, this a good listen. It starts out heavy, like Deep Purple for kids weaned on grunge. A tad too much for some of us glam fans, but nonetheless, it's a fine way to kick things off. Then, you feel some funk creeping up. Organs come in around the middle of the album, and it creates a great vibe that you couldn't have expected earlier on. Then the album winds down and the guitars start getting less heavy and more acoustic. By the time it ends, the album seems to have undergone a softening of sorts. And yet, it feels perfectly natural. There no real clunkers on this thing, and some tracks' enjoyable factor may outlast their playing time. Overall, a commendable effort that stands up better than you might expect."
1,Chicago Metallic Bunt pan,"Despite all the good reviews this pan got I had a whole lot of bad experiences with it firstly, the cake stuck in the pan, no matter how high or low heat you used the pan still burned, I resorted to just placing one pan within the other, this worked but the cake would not release from the pan. I have other pans by this brand and they work fine just not this one."
4,Deceptive Title but good pan,"This pan is NOT 11 x 10.9 x 7 as stated at top of page.This item is ACTUALLY 10 X 10 X 3.5. They have since changed the ad, but the title still says the larger size.I returned this item thinking they had shipped me the wrong one, but they resent the same pans. Therefore, I guess the description was inaccurate. On the plus side, the replacement arrived in two days! I'll keep the smaller size, because it IS a standard size, but I really wanted a deeper one and can't seem to find one. Pans are sturdy and I don't anticipate any problems, as long as I follow the directions about reducing heat 25 degrees, etc."
3,First time reading this author,"I found the book okay. I thought (and hoped) it would stand up to books by Richard Crais and Lee Child. It didn't have any punch and didn't call me to come and read like those authors do. I think it was because I didn't find the characters particularly interesting and I didn't like the main character's name ""Cork"". That name didn't set well with me. I found it awkward. It wasn't a waste of time, I read it on a vacation, and it was easy reading."
4,"Deeper, More Complex Krueger Book","More than the other books I've read by this fine author, ""Blood Hollow"" is deep, nuanced and bold. The author takes the death of a girl in the Boundary Waters country of Minnesota and weaves a compelling story of intrigue and suspense. The characters are well-drawn and the plot moves steadily forward without resorting to plot devices that strain credulity. Krueger treats the intermingling cultures of the Ojibwe and the western inhabitants of the area with skill and respect, and in this book, he handily employs the religions of the two groups. Religion plays an important role in this book. With this book I believe that Krueger places himself among the best mystery writers of the day, and I eagerly look forward to reading more of his Cork O'Connor books."
3,It was ok,The book was ok. Mostly just quotes from teen mothers. Not much author input. Book did come in good shape though.
3,Not crazy about this one,"Our 3-year old son loves tractors, but this DVD does not interest him for more than maybe a few minutes. We like Amy Grant and Vince Gill a lot, but this cartoon seems boring to us and our son."
5,Must read this book,"I cannot imagine why this book isn't the top selling book here. It should be. I read it, argued with it, researched to ""see if it was so,"" came back and read it again, cried, argued some more, and slowly began to accept that Catton is telling us the truth."
5,"THE SKY ""MIGHT"" BE FALLING!","Being the first reviewer of this title verifies the specificity of the subject matter. Trying to be a skeptic among both extremes of environmental thought can be a tough act, especially after reading such explosive ""documentation"" of what Catton blatantly subtitles ""The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change"". His research is thick and juicy; his claims believeable. Written in 1980, the concerns maintain an ever-increasing credibility of the much earlier ""Tragedy of the commons"" analogy, in that, limited resources and unlimited consumption will eventually come to a head. This book shines a giant flashlight on what many don't what to look at. I'm still on the fence, but looking into the other yard now. Highly recommend this for those in the light though it is written for those in the dark. Could be one of the most important books in this lifetime if not the next."
1,Overshoot,"An entirely outdated book.Author does not even consider nuclear or hydrogen, which will be the next two big sources of energy. Too bombastic, states opinions as facts. A real bummer."
5,The ecological view,I own some eight thousand books and if my house caught fire this is the only book I would risk my life to save. Read it and it will change the way you view the human race. Probably one of the most important books ever written.
1,What a bunch of Pat--oooooo-eh!!,"Full of errors. If I had bought this book I would be really mad right now. Thank the lord it was a gift. This ""book"", if you can call it that, has to be the most frustrating thing that you could do. I would rather pull all the hair from my back then read this again!!"
1,This book is error-filled.,"This book is a great idea but filled with errors. Once you figure out what are the correct answers: ""The answers are arranged by tens, starting with numbers ending in one and ending with numbers ending in zero."",you discover lots of errors. For example, a correct answer is supposed to be #5,yet there are only 4 choices. Sloppy, sloppy. I do not recommend buying this book unless you want to research the questions that you do not know the answers to."
1,The book was an anlogy of (Good),"Mis-Leading, a waste of time, yet a powerful documentation of things that never went on. A great story teller of all not so true baseball facts. I recommend that you REALLY buy this book."
1,"Big mistake buying from ""novacompanies""","Big mistake buying from ""novacompanies"" no one home when it comes to honoring ""money back guarantee"" or service.Pump is totally worthless. Doesn't work at all. Even after positive pressure to the vacuum port, it filled the tank instead of draining it! And that is with no exit hose and zero back pressure!"
3,Helpful But . . .,"It does help to pick up distance radio stations under the right conditions. If you are unable to get a real antenna, this one will be helpful for most amateur listeners."
3,Modern management of Japanese education system,"Book under review has ten chapters : Introduction; Some highlights and implications of Japanese history; The first winning margin - Education; Recruitment in Japan; The second winning margin - Management; The third winning margin - training; The Japanese emphasis on technicians; Career development in Japan; Are the Japanese innovative?; Lessons for the West. The book under review offers the authors' point of view a balanced and realistic understanding of the key reasons for Japan's success. The book address to : Business people, industrialists, educationalists, training specialists, scientists, general reader interested in Japan and Japanese economic and technological success. Written in an accesible English language, the lessons for the West are spelled out clearly: education, management concerned with developing people's potential, and relevant workplace training are the `secrets' of Japanese success."
5,Great way to meet mr. Frost,". This small book was perfect for me, as I was looking for an inexpensive introduction to Robert Frost's poetry."
4,Good Basic Info....,This book and the other I purchased in the series (The Natural Soap Book) have good information but I find it a lil unrealistic when it comes to recipes. The recipes she gives are for gigantic batches of soaps. For the beginning soapmakers they are dang near ridiculous in size for batches. I found the book Smart Soapmaking by Anne L. Watson much more geared towards beginning and intermediate soapmakers with much better information including wonderful resources for lye calculators and recipe calculators that you can set the superfat discounts and water % as well. Was much more resourceful to me than these books by cavitch.
3,Methods are Dated,"I really enjoy this book for ideas and inspiration. She has some truly wonderful soaping ideas in here, and I love just browsing through it.That being said, I really don't use it that much. The recipes call for too many ingredients, are WAY to heavily superfatted to last, and her mixing method (in a stand mixer) takes forever. I can stick blend my soap to trace in just a couple of minutes.We've also found out a few things about grapefruit seed extract since this book was published. Basically, it does little to nothing to preserve the shelf life of your soaps....a lot of reputable suppliers are pulling it from the retail inventory and substituting other antioxidants.If you're looking for some interesting ideas, by all means invest, but don't make this your first book."
3,"Some good advice for novice soapmakers, with limitations","I am only just getting into soapmaking and found this book to be comprehensive and interesting for the most part. What I did not find helpful was the limited (and often dangerous) lack of direction that the author gives re: safety and soapmaking. References like, 'be ready to leave the room' or words to that effect, if you are overcome by fumes, is not my idea of dealing with safety issues, in a professional and sustainable way. Im still looking for information before I begin making soaps but this book did pique my interest even more. Limited what's available at present, finding a book on soapmaking that covers all bases, completely and accurately. It is a craft/business that is growing by leaps and bounds though, hopefully someone will write a book that really covers every issue in detail. Ill be ready to purchase!"
2,Out of date but of historical interest,"The book is showing its age and doesn't include modern techniques such as using a stick blender, or curing cold process soaps in the oven. The chapter on ""Soapmaking Online"" is hilariously out of date.Way too much of the content is based on the author's biases and world-view. It's hard to sort fact from opinion and trust any of her pronouncements.Some of the recipes have a lot of ingredients. I doubt that there's a good reason for a soap with 6 or 8 different oils.It's a worthwhile purchase as your 3rd or 4th book on soap making, and for it's historical interest."
3,all the technical facts you need,"This book has really good technical know how,but the recipies are way off! I tried several, following them to the letter, using a laboratory scale, and not one of them turned out right. I was able to adjust the recipies using the technical info from the second part of the book, however."
3,Has some good features and some bad features.,"This is a big, fat book with a lot of discussion of soap-making temperatures, sodium hydroxide discounts, and the properties of various ingredients. It's an interesting addition to an experienced soap-maker's library, but it would not be very useful for beginners. (Beginners would probably be better off with Coney's ""Complete Soapmaker"".) I did not like the complicated recipes with zillions of ingredients, the small, hard-to-read typeface printed in horrible green ink, or the fact that the recipes often measure certain ingredients in ounces and others in grams, necessitating the use of two different scales. On the plus side, the book does include the saponnification values of various oils for those who wish to design their own recipes, although the formula given for doing so is rather complex."
4,A Wonderful Book To Learn From,"I just received this book today and I am almost half way through it already! I have done tons of reading about the soap making process on the Internet, and I find Ms. Cavitch's book to be packed full of information. The book is easy to read, easy to understand, and has quite a few recipes. If you are new to soap making, as I am, or just want more information on the process, this should be included in your soap making book library!"
4,Second Best Soap Making Book,"Although I find Susan's first book The Natural Soap Book the best book on soapmaking, this comes in at a close second. Although much of the material is repeated from her first book, Susan supplements her previous information with interesting recipes, more information on products to use in your soap and a question and answer section. I'm always reading and learning new things from Susan."
5,Thorough text,"This is the best soapmaking book I have read thus far. It is complete with not only recipes, but also with oil and additive properties, and the chemistry of saponification.The one criticism I would make is that the section on the developing a business is rather vague and ends the book quite abruptly.I would recommend this book for anyone who really wants to understand what is happening in the soapmaking process."
5,New at soap making,"I got this book in good condition and in good time. I would buy from this seller again. Haven't really had a chance to use the book yet, but it has some really good detailed info and recipes."
3,The Soapmaker's Companion,"Good information in this book. The recipes however, are listed in grams, ounces, teaspoons, pounds, etc... There is a lot of conversions to do to use the recipes in this book."
3,Disapointed,"With all the rave reviews I was really excited about getting this book. I'm brand new to soapmaking and was really looking forward to using this book. Thank God it wasn't the first book I purchased on the subject. If it had been I would never have tried it at all. Other reviews claim this is a great book for beginners, and I have to disagree. Perhaps the book is a bit dated as stated by another reviewer, but I found it to be too much info and what's with the GSE? That being said, there is some good info in this book, and I do like the Q&A Chapter, but I would not recommend this for a beginner. I found Anne L. Watson's ""Smart Soapmaking"" is a much better choice."
3,Book has some problems,"Many of the recipes Cavitch gives call for a lot of hard to find and expensive oils, which can discourage new soapmakers.She also superfats too much, and I also think that can misinform newbies.Her descriptions of oils and their properties are really helpful, but she doesn't describe using a stick blender at all (only a regular blender).Good for reference, but definitely should not be used as a soap making bible. I found Kathy Miller's site much more helpful, more informative, and much more realistic for today's soapmaker."
4,A must have in any soap maker's library,"I have lots of soapmaking books, but this is one that I refer to over and over. The information is reliable and comprehensive. I tend to refer to the properties of oils most frequently, but I've read the book cover to cover. This is a great authoritative guide for the starting out cold process soap maker. Once you master the fundamentals that Susan clearly explains, you can move on with confidence to your own custom creations."
5,Great guide to making soap at home,I found her information very helpful and clear. My mother also uses this book and is the one who suggested it to me. She has been making soap at home for years and finds this book the best one she's seen.
3,Not for beginners!,"This book is filled with good information about making soap. But I would definitely not recommend it for a beginner! If I had bought this book first, I would never have made my first batch. Her instructions are not precise enough for folks who know nothing about making soap. She also uses terms that I wasn't familiar with a few weeks ago (before making my own soap). Her methodology is more complicated than it has to be.I VERY MUCH prefer Smart Soapmaking by Anne Watson.Smart Soapmaking: The Simple Guide to Making Traditional Handmade Soap Quickly, Safely, and Reliably, or How to Make Luxurious Handcrafted Soaps for Family, Friends, and YourselfNow that I have made several batches of soap using Anne's methods, I can read ""The Companion"" without being instantly intimidated."
3,Tough read but worth the effort if you are patient,"I read Schumpeter's ""History of economic analysis"" a couple of months ago so I decided dive into this other important contribution. I must admit, it wasn't nearly as interesting and took some real effort. The other reviews listed go over his important points about the business cycles but what I enjoyed about ""History"" was his style of writing that was witty, down to earth and very sharp. This book seemed to be the opposite. Not my favorite."
4,Steve W,I bought these for my son and he loves them. They are made of quality wood and seem solid. We are thinking of getting another pair and donating them to his school band.
3,Comfortable but wear fast,"Without a doubt these are super comfortable work gloves. But I wore out the palm in 3-4 wearings. I was using them for gathering kindling, splitting wood, moving wood. The leather palms are just too thin for that kind of activity. Now I have two holes in them with stuffing coming out."
2,Back Yard Birds,"Pictures are great, but there are so many other books out there with better information."
3,"Amor, Vida de mi Vida, Zarzuela",Need to send it back because it does not work as a video in my TV or Mac
5,Hermoso Arte,"Las interpretaciones de Plácido Domingo son siempre perfectas. Escuchar su fuerte, dulce y armoniosa voz es una experiencia muy gratificante. Además, Ana María Martínez es una encantadora persona, poseedora de una maravillosa voz. El dúo formado por ellos es un embeleso; incita a escharlo repetidamente."
5,Domingo does it again!!!,"A delightful concert given by the best of the best. Zarzuelas never caught too much outside Spain. Domingo is doing his best to expose to the rest of the world this slightly different form of opera/operetta. The melodies in this Blu-Ray are well chosen and beautiful. There is no doubt that Domingo, Martinez and Lopez Cobos really enjoy performing in this concert. The audience also seems to like it, but.. at the end the performers have to please their audiences, so the last encore is a known melody from the Marry Widow sung in German.The imagery and sound are perfect. In summary, a great concert to enjoy and get exposed to great Zarzuela melodies.I am still waiting for great full Zarzuela productions on DVD and Blu-Ray available in the US. Luisa Fernanda is one of them, not surprisingly with Domingo in the cast.Highly recommended."
5,Amor Vida de mi Vida Salzburg Concert,Superb concert with very good music from Spain and two greatperformers. Plácido Domingo and Ana María Martínez the greatpuerttorican soprano. Very good concert!
3,Not a great game but lots of nostaglia,"I remember playing this game as a kid on pc. Looking back I can see the acting was pretty bad at times and the overall game play was fairly simple compared to today's games, but I still went ahead and spent the pitiful $3 asked to play it again. Even today it's probably a great game for beginning gamers (meaning small children). There's no over the top bloodshed and it's simple enough to figure out."
2,Fun Game But Kind of Hard,This Star Wars video game is so awesome! Level 1: Easy. But the other levels: hard. Pretty fun but hard. If your child plays the first level of the game they would think its the easiest game of all time. But when they play the rest of the game they would think its so hard they would want to get rid of it.
2,Good For Begining Players,"This game was a very fast, easy, boring game. It wasn't fun because most of the game was clips from the Star Wars movies. The only reason I gave it two stars was because it would show some excitment to young begining players."
1,Awful,VMU games are the worst thing ever. I dont know why I thought this would be a good idea to buy because its garbage. It features grade school quality acting. Maybe you could consider it to be one of those so bad its good kinda things. In that case 11 thumbs up.
2,I was drunk when I bought it...,This is a video of a Boxing form/kata/pattern. It shows the form in it's completion then breaks it down into different sections but does not offer any instruction on individual moves/techniques. I was unable to find an english language track for the video (it's been a while since I watched it so it may be on there somewhere...). The provided language track is chinese.Unless you are very experienced in kung fu/gymnastics this video is almost worthless.I give it two stars because the form is beautiful and very well executed.
2,Hmmmmm..... not quite what I expected.,Well I was not impressed with anything about this DVD. Save your money and buy something else. Very boring to watch.
5,Lovely pair of earrings,"I bought these for myself and I am very pleased with them. Good craftsmanship, nicely shaped pearls. Eye-catching and fashionable. Highly recommended for the price!"
4,Nothing Personal,"I really enjoy the Nothing Personal cd. This cd includes many acoustic song pieces. The cd has more of a pop/country sound to it, like a lot of today's music. The tone, the clarity, the mood that Mark McKay sets, and the state of mind that it places you in is very different from many cd's. This cd speaks differently to different people. For those who like pop/country music, Nothing Personal speaks most to them. Mark McKay's cd offers an entirely different level of communication to it's listeners than other cd's. Mark McKay's lyrics enable you to actually sit down and think about what he's singing; and many of his lyrics can also be related to different events going on in your life. Overall, Mark McKay's Nothing Personal cd is an extremely enjoyable, thought provoking album."
1,I LOVE MOZZ......,"...but just hate this dvd ! Recorded with two audience-cameras at both extremes of the stage, so no frontal takes whatsover, grainy and dirty picture and HORRENDOUS sound ( guitar and vox can't be heard, it's all bass and drums) . Steer clear of exploitative releases like this one."
1,"The quality was so bad to make a shy, bald Buddhist reflect..","The video and audio quality of this ""DVD"" is appalling. A Fisher-Price PXL 2000 would have yielded better results. Do not buy. Again, do not buy."
1,Morrissey-Live in Dallas DVD,Does not play in my DVD player-need to return. Tried it in two different players-no image at all-Warming sign says dvd not supported
5,Dope Cd,Super spiffy cd production is mad dope del comes with sick flows not as mad as he wuz in no need more of a narrative definite must have for hiero heads
1,In need of beat development,"I got this record at a Heiro show from Phesto from Souls and was soooo amped to hear the lost album of Del's. My friends and I hopped in the car after the show, popped it in the deck and continued to fast-forward till we threw in something else. It is no wonder Del got dropped from Elektra while working on this album and I should have known better when I picked up ""Both Sides of the Brain.""The thing is, I KNOW DEL CAN DO BETTER. ""No Need For Alarm"" was an amasing album and a classic, but this was plain garbage. He is an amazing emcee, but the mehhh beats can only go so far. Sorry folks, but this gets a thumbs down. Check his first two LPs for dopness."
4,Lyric Licking At Its Best,"When first viewing this album you may think because it was made in '97 its not worth the paper in your pocket. But this album stands apart from Del's recent album 'Both Sides of the Brain' delivering completely different beats & riffs and brilliant rhymes. Dels vocals are easy on the ear and uniquely strung together making every track listenable and never boring.Dels storytelling excels in tracks ""Why Wanna Get Funky"" and ""Corner Story"" and beats on ""Lyric Licking"", ""Don't Forget The Bass"" and ""Future Development"" are reminders of what true hip-hop should be about and not the current R&B trends.This is a must for any Hieroglyphics and Del followers and any Hip-Hop lovers."
3,not del's best...,"this album is alright...but compared to what Del is capable of, this one doesn't cut it. I was excited to get this album, expecting crazy lyrics..and that didn't really happen except for a couple of songs. My favorite songs on here are Love is Worth, and Town to Town. Town to Town is our future version of Del...damaging the sounds like we're used to.Not a bad album overall. Just average."
4,classic hip hop by a legend,"Future development is not Del's tightest(I think everyone can agree that Deltron 3030 delivers the best lyrical assault out of Del's collective), but this album carries an old school hip hop flavor that is hard to deny. The lyrics are still tight and on point and the beats are rather decent. If you are the kind that compares, you would notice that this albums production is much better than Both sides of the brain, yet the lyrical content is somewhat more achieved on Both sides of the brain, whereas the lyrics on Future Development are kind of in the growing process of Del's flow style. Still an amazing album by one of the best emcees ever. Pick it up, bask in the classic hip hop flavor, get schooled by the Delmeister."
3,Passable rhythm & blues attempt,"Considered by many an attempt at rhythm and blues, this album has a couple of good songs but only gets a listen every few months or so. Many fans thought the use of ""Don't You Know What The Night Can Do?"" on the Miller beer ads was a sellout; didn't bother me. Other songs, such as ""One More Morning"" and ""The Morning Song,"" are more mellow and meaningful, and the title track grabs you and makes you want to move around, even if (like me) the idea of dancing just horrifies you....The one advantage ""Roll With It"" and ""Holding On"" have is they translate very well to live performances, unlike some other Winwood songs.For die-hard Winwood fans, this album is a must. Others looking to sample Winwood's best work, check out ""Back In The High Life."""
2,Roll elsewhere,"Steve Winwood made some great music in the 1980s with the albums ""Arc of a Diver"" and ""Back in the High Life."" Unfortunately, by the time this album rolled around, he was starting to sound as if he had exhausted his supply of good songs. The title track is catchy, but unfortunately little else rises above the level of pleasant filler material. This is the album that marked the beginning of the rapid decline in Winwood's solo career."
2,Sappy Pop Music,"My how the mighty have fallen. When Steve Windwood was with Traffic, his compositions had much more natural sounds. Here drum machines and synthesizers rule the day. Whereas there are a few interesting riffs here and there, the cheesy arrangements and paint by the number lyrics bring this work down to mediocrity."
4,Where the hell IS Steve these days?????!?!?,"I have to start by saying that I don't listen to a ton of music in this genre....whatever that may be....beer commercial music???I love this disc....it's not perfect, but Steve has a touch to both the music and his voice that puts everything he does a notch above the competition....it's instantly catchy, and instantly recognizable -- AND IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE TO SAY THAT ABOUT OTHER THAN BRITTNEY SPEARS AND NSYNC!!!!(please forget i mentioned them -- i'm venting!!!!)...the radio was just as saturated with Steve Winwood around the time this album came out, as it is with the girl and boy bands now that are so ridiculous....But songs like ""Holding On,"" ""Shining Song"" and ""Roll With It"" are worthy of all the airplay they have ever gotten.....Everything on this disc is good, most of it borders on great, but ""Don't You Know What The Night Can Do"" (one of my favorite songs ever) is completely unforgettable.....and worth getting this CD for, alone!"
3,Oh Boy the seller...!!!,"im giving it 3 stars because it took literally 29 days to receive my book. omg what a bad experience with the seller.! anyway the book is amazing if you are a tolkien fan. i red the whole book within 24 hours. very Captivating ! I recently bought ""the Tale of teh children of Hurin"" Cant wait to read it."
4,A classic,A great adventure in any language. A great adventure in any language. A great adventure in any language. A grea
3,disappointed,I have a hard time thinking of things to say. This didnt really make it better. It is a nice idea and has some nice examples but it didnt really help me think of ways to say thank you to certain things like a group.
1,A real let down,Clever is in the eyes of the beholder. There is nothing new here. i was expecting so much more.
3,Black Dolls,"These are very nice dolls, not durable enough for little ones who don't understand that the clothes don't come off!! (even though they're recommended for 18mos and up-my 3yr old is a bit young for their construction even) Nice with the extended family to teach about grandparents. A little pricey (I paid 16.00) but I'd probably buy them again they're so cute."
3,Good but old.,There is a good book on programmble logic for the logic of the early 1990-th. We used this book as introduction in our University. This book is helpful to teach the history of programmable logic.
4,Nice Overview,"This book has a nice, light intro into the areas engineers are working on, and current problems that need to be resolved in the future (how we may use nanotechnology, etc.). Engaging and a good way to get the brain moving, and keep you aware of where the field is going."
4,Theodore Baby!!!,"""Ghostface"" is really earning a reputation with fellow comrade and future star in the making, ""Trife Da God"". Lyrically and production wise, the album is hotter than the Sahara Desert. Ghostface along with his group Theodore Unit, Ghost has attracted a legion of loyal supporters who appreciate the music he is supplying to the general public. Ghostface's music is speaking for what the future is in store for him and Ghostface is proving to may doubters that he can hang with the best of them."
3,survicious,"The CD was ""aiight"", but the bonus DVD made the purchase a must have... Ghostface throws an excellent underground ""Wu-style"" concert. He has special Wu guest (Cappadonna, Masta Killa, and Gza) along with Trife, and a special appearance from his son (fogot his name)... If you are in to Wu, the DVD is a must have..."
4,"GOOD SCI-FI,GREAT PRICE","THIS BOX SET HAS 3 DVD'S. FILM QUALITY ON SOME IS SUB-PAR BUT CONSIDERING THE LOW COST, I AM HAPPY TO HAVE THIS AND RECOMEND THIS TO LOVERS OF OLD SCI-FI"
4,The Best Of A Troublesome Format,"There is no doubt that VHS-C tapes although convenient for many of us videographers can be a royal pain in the butt when playing through our VCR's. However...having said this...the Maxell is the best and I am so pleased especially at its lower than average price that I will definitely order more! I know some people who could use a good adapter...one that won't get stuck in the vcr or refuse to eject. Don't be put off by the fact that the little tapes fit tightly into this adapter as compared to older types that just allowed you to drop them in! The tight ""fit"" Maxell boasts is for good reason and it works...wonderfully! The whole mechanism reacts quickly with the use of a ""AA"" battery. Make no mistake ...Maxell is far superior to others that stretch tapes or don't quite treat vcr's too kindly. I find the Maxell adapter to be refreshingly different!"
3,Turn down the volume!!!,I actually have the 24x16x40 Burner by Yamaha but my brother has this one as well. We have had no problems with it and it works just fine. The only problem I have with it is it is sooooo loud. I honestly think they need to put a muffler on it or something because I have to turn my speakers up most of the time to hear the sound over the Cdrom. I try not to use this for reading Cds but sometimes you just forget which tray you put it in. Go ahead and get it but get used to the noise.
1,A piece of junk,They my be fine when they work but if you ever have a problem your out of luck.There customer support said my only option is to buy a new one. Mine was only 14 months old and three cds.A hundred bucks bites the dirt. Needless to say I won't be buying another Yamaha product.It is to bad I can't give it neg. stars
1,"Only lasted 14 months, JUNK!!","Should get a negative 5 stars!! What a waste of a $140!!! After just 14 months this thing crapped out on me. I used this drive quite frugally, maybe burnt 30 CD's or less. It started dying by just burning half of the data and then one day it stopped recognizing that there was a disk in the drive at all. My faith in the Yamaha brand has just plummeted. If you want a really amazing drive for less money get a Lite-On!! It is the same brand that most major computer manufacturers use, all the quality without the big name brand on the front. Only $60 and it runs like a champ and ten times faster then the Yamaha ever ran. I have switched all my drives to Lite-On, they are top quality drives for dirt cheap cost. Both my DVD and CD drive perform perfectly!!"
1,Updating firmware toasted the drive,"I recently tried to upgrade the firmware on this drive and now the drive is a retractable cupholder! I've got a LOT of experience with things like firmware upgrades and followed the instructions to the letter. The firmware update program said that it completed successfully and I figured I'd be off and burning again. Now the drive won't even recognize a commercial pressed CD. I tried installing the drive in another machine as a check and it was dead there too. Yamaha used to be ""The Brand"" and all I'd buy. Now I'm done with them."
4,Simple + Excellent = Simply Excellent,"It is unfortunate that Carl Sagan's last books was/is Billions and Billions. Not because it's a bad book, but because its very nature (columns which appeared in Parade magazine make up a good portion of the book) results in very basic explanations which only skim the surface of fascinating topics such as the search for planets around other stars. The book contains some political material which affirms what we already knew, that Dr. Sagan was an unabashed liberal. What is refreshing, however, is that he asserts not blunt ideology, but well-reasoned explanations for why he feels what he feels. The prose in this book is superb and a light-hearted sensibility remains a subtext throughout. Highly recommended."
5,"Excellent as always, sadly his last",I have read just about every book the late Dr. Sagan ever published and I can say unhesitatingly that they are all top-notch and brilliant. This book is no exception. I recommend anything Carl Sagan ever wrote.
2,A book that shows the effecs of Sagan's illness,"This book will dissapoint Sagan's fans. The mind of the master is worn and torn by his cancer and yields a bland discussion on an uncoordinated series of topics. In the first few pages, petending to be PC to those with little scientific background, he engages himself on trivial explanations of maths and physics - these will certainly be useful to primary-school students but not to those who have followed his writings.The highlight of the book is an extraordinary discussion on abortion and on the general pro-choice vs. pro-life arguments. Absolutely brillant, especially if you are pro-choice.New readers to Sagan would be better off by buying Shadows of Forgotten Ancerstors or Broca's Brains. Those who have read Sagan, may be better off by stopping at his second to last book, his masterpiece: The Demon Hauted World."
3,"some of it good, the rest is awful.","there are some very interesting remarks about all the usual stuff Sagen is dealing with, but there are some long and boring stuff about, for example - what is this numbers name : 1,000,000,000,000. worth reading, only if you are a Sagen fan, and have the time to spend"
2,Drivel,"While I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Sagan , his work and the institution he represented, this book is a disappointment. These essays are ramblings, very liberal in outlook and mere drivel. Nothing of substance is presented. These writings may make good reading in popular magazines but certainly nothing new or noteworthy is presented. I believe the draw for this title is that the author was a very popular figure and has now passed into the cosmos."
1,Sagan at his contradictory best,"After laying out rules of logic (which he didn't invent) in ""demon haunted world"" here he violates them in is discussions of defense, abortion and nearly everything else. What would Sagan think if he knew his religion of naturalism was being destroyed (""Nature's Destiny,"" ""Rare Earth,"" ""Darwin's Black Box"")? Sagan did a lot to promote science, but his personal beliefs were incosistent with science he practiced."
1,One Star in the Universe,"Billions and billions of stars in the universe but only one for this book. Why? Because Carl Sagan was totally ignorant of the subatomic world and the possibility of multiverses. He saw only one star in the sky, and its name was Sagan. He was a sophist who appealed mainly to a pop culture that looked for easy-to-digest science in support of its secular morality."
3,Sagan looks inward,"I think this book needs to be read mindful of the time frame in which it was written...Sagan was in the ever growing shadows of his looming demise. Despite this, he remains optimistic and compelled, as always, to share his many fascinating insights into the wonders of life in its broadest sense. As a Sagan admirer, I was touched by the unusual introspectiveness of this book which makes it unique amongst his prolific writings. True, this book does not represent the author at his critical and imaginative zenith, but he still presents many wonderful insights into a dazzling array of subjects. This is Carl stepping back and smelling the roses of a remarkably productive and brilliant life. This book is all the more remarkable considering that his awe and optimism reverberate even as he became aware that his time was drawing to a close. A worthwhile read."
4,No one else like Carl Sagan,"Even though it's a bit dated now, this is still a great read. No one makes the inconceivable more tangible than Carl Sagan. Numbers and concepts that you may understand in general, become crystal clear through Sagan's concise and creative verbal illustrations. What a loss that he is no longer with us."
5,I love Carl Sagan,I love this book so insigtful and wonderful the book was just on time. And I love how Carl Sagan writes
4,Useful and readable.,"I've used this book in a unique way, being able to site it in just about every paper I wrote for a science class this year. Sagan covers many of the pressing environmental and ethical dilemmas facing us in the modern world. It's a very readable book that makes the case for being an environmentalist without becoming dogmatic. Sagan also outlines the significance of exponential numbers in the universe and everyday life, with fun and interesting examples. A very useful book to have on your shelf."
