2,Works but. . .,I received my order sooner than expected. My low rating is based on the contruction. Each of the standing supports split when the screw was inserted. I do not like returning items and consider myself a do-it-your-selfer. I was able to repair each of the ends and strengthen the support with glue and clamps. Quality control missed on this item. I would not buy these again.
2,Wood Splits Every Time Even With Pre-Drilling !!,"The first one I assembled split badly at every position when I screwed in the screws. And I have a lot of carpentry experience. I screwed the screws slowly and with considerable care using only a screwdriver. And then the vertical pieces split, one of them badly. I will upload a photo later. So, I drilled out the second stand with 1/8 inch drill bit thinking that would take care of things. Wrong! It still split all but one screw location, only not nearly as bad. I am going to write to the company and see if they will send me some new posts. I didn't like drilling to the next size holes because the screws don't always tighten. But they tightened a lot better than the split ones! To say the least, I am not happy with the materials -- especially for this price. This should not happen. For just a few pieces of wood, they sure charge a lot of money -- especially when the wood splits so easily."
2,"Decent and Cheap, But Wouldn't Recommend","I read the reviews already on this site and purchased it anyway. When I assembled the product I immediately found that the pre-drilled holes were too small for the screws, which meant almost every screw I used split the base of the wood. It looks unattractive, but it's not really noticeable.I ended up throwing away the plastic rear covers because I quickly realized that it would be near impossible to run my speaker cables through it with the plastic piece in the grooves. Not unless I had a 2 year old's hands or something.Overall the stands do as they should: hold my speakers."
2,sanus system bf-24 wood speaker stand,"i could have return this product if not for my son throwing the boxes away. one of the stand cracked while putting the screw, in fairness to sanus the appearance of this stand looks great."
2,"Great video, but the song is only mediocre","This is one of Aphex Twin's best known songs, because the video made such waves. However, this song pales next to classic Aphex tracks like ""On"" and ""Ventolin"". It's fun to listen, but without watching the video you'll soon get bored. There are two additional remixes on this cd, but they are completely uninspired and dull. All in all, you'd be better off with buying the video tape, this cd is barely worth the money."
3,"Good, but not Great","I did enjoy the whole of this ep/single more than I did Come to Daddy, or even the Richard D. James album, but I still only give it 3 stars due to the fact that it was only a single. I felt the title song sounded a tad bit more like early 90's Aphex such as I Care Because You Do. It was still worth the money."
3,the return of richard d james,"""Windowlicker"" is, at face value, porn music for the late 90s. It's chock full of groans, giggles and bouncing basslines and melodies. The video more or less confirms this tongue-in-cheek angle while managing to make a jab at everything we love to hate about American culture. The programming on the rest of the single (2 more tracks only) is pretty intense though, a bit removed from the kitschy pop of the title track. Those who enjoyed the ""Come to Daddy"" tracks will certainly enjoy this, despite its brevity."
4,The video bumps it from three to four stars,"Sure it should be judged on the musical quality, but that video is just good, very funny.""Windowlicker"" is still a good quality song, it is a funny and fresh mish-mash of ten different genres, your girlfriend will probably like it. Track 2 is just horrible, Richard can call it highly experimental all he wants but that doesn't magically change it into a good track. But than ahh ""Nannou"" comes on and instantly erases the memory of that horrible second track from my ears. It sounds like a bunch of music boxes all going off at different times, there is even a pause in the song where some winding takes place, it is a beautiful song.I say to you Richard less ""experimental"" music and more like this, you really can make nice sounding music when you try."
4,"Electronic whizzkids do it again, and how!!!","The Aphex Twins is a well know band in the field of electronic dance music.This single is well balanced, and you hear their inspiration, namely KRAFTWERK. They combine this with the ""razor editing"" technique, which was used allot in the lated 80's by European mixers like Ben Liebrand, Peter Slaghuis, Tim Simmenon and the PWL guys.If you like the cd, check out the video.This is dance music optima forma. We want more!!!"
5,new from......:richard d James,"The video kicks boodie get this! THhe music is great, no the best ever as well!"
5,Just try getting this one out of your brainbrain!,"This cd is incredible. Definetly the only time I have ever heard someone mix a musicbox(song 3)! But the champion of this cd is definetly Windowlicker. Everytime you think you've got a grasp on the song it gets flipped upside-down all over again! Different, rythmic, you don't know what to do first with this song playing.... It took me a couple weeks to get it out of my head. The video is a must-see."
3,"Works as Advertised, But Easy to Do Yourself","I bought this since I have several friends that mark their balls this way. I have no complaints: it does what it's supposed to, and it does help me line up my putts easier. I especially like practicing my putts with marked balls, as I get instant feed back on my stoke.Comment/Suggestion: seems a little over-priced for what you get. I was looking on-line after I bought it and saw a great suggestion. Just buy a 32-oz Gatorade bottle and pull the ring off that holds on the cap (after you drink of course!). Its the perfect size and works just as well. (its actually a little quicker and easier to use, if perhaps a not as upscale). Hope this helps."
2,"OK, but found something better",I bought one a year ago and it has been OK. It is a little difficult to position on the ball and it slides around the ball often when trying to draw a line on the ball. Making a scribbled line. I have dealt with that until I saw a friend using the Pro Putt 360. They were putting at that and he told me he used it to draw a line also. A dual capable tool. I bought it and it was much easier to use and more repeatable.Pro Putt 360
4,Great read,"I really enjoyed this book. Although it is written to speak to mothers who raise their children by them selves, as a stay at home mom of a 2yo, I found the information in the book helpful. My biggest take away is to have a conversation with boys while you are moving, it registers in their brains better if you are active with them. What a great tip to help me be a better mom."
2,This Book Is Religious,"The book might be great for people who want a religiously based book, with Bible verses and assertions about knowing what God's plan is for you as a mom. Just be aware that this is what this book is and choose accordingly.Just thought the prospective readers should know what they are buying."
1,Not impressed,"This book was not what I expected. I was expecting much more information regarding the topic of raising boys. I did like how it made an effort to show how boys think differently. This is a big plus, but its really the only thing I found informative in this book. I also think this book and the description on the back are very misleading in that it offers no indication of how much religion is discussed. This book is not for the non-religious. There are MUCH better books out there along the same topic without religion constantly discussed."
3,Great for single moms,"I'm only giving this book three stars because it really didn't live up to my hopes. As a mother-to-be of a son, I guess I was anticipating something a little different. The book is definitely geared toward single moms, and I'm sure single mom's could find this book to be great. I wish that the product description could include this tidbit of info. Don't get me wrong, the book does have great advice on raising a boy, but its predominately based on raising boys in an absent father type of environment."
1,"WOuld love to say, but............",I can't review this book because I still have not received it??????????????????????????Ask me again and maybe I'll be able to review it later.
4,Recommended,"This is an excellent book for any Miata MX-5 enthusiast, well written with plenty of pictures. Of particular interest is the extensive and detailed history of the MX-5 with wonderful photos of prototypes and early designs.As this book was written in the UK, it has a decided UK (actually a worldwide) flavor. Although not a negative, if you're from the U.S., it causes a few double-takes when you first see pictures of right-hand drivers. You'll also quickly get used to the language differences: boot for trunk, tonneau cover for boot, hood for convertible top, and bonnet for hood.Written in 2002, the last year model covered is the 2001. But since very little has changed since then, the book is not seriously lacking in covering the modern versions.Buy this book if you're interested in Miata MX-5 history details: model changes, design, production, worldwide differences. Don't buy if you're interested in performance improvements, racing, repairs, or modifications."
4,Great Gift for the Mazda Owner,"If one of your friends owns a Miata and you are looking for a gift idea, here is your answer. Fun reading and good tips for keeping the car in great shape."
2,"Too much blah, blah, blah","The author has a very dictatorial tone and she talks down to the knitter. I would have appreciated more pictures, too."
3,A very nice book,"I wanted to build a collection of Elizabeth Zimmerman's books, and this is one that I wanted. I particularly like the baby items and the hats that are included."
5,Wonderful!! Inspirational!! So much for so little...,"Elizabeth Zimmerman is my knitting hero, and this modest-seeming little book is my favorite of her works. So many wonderful stories, knitting insights, and great designs... I've read it cover to cover several times, and knit quite a few of the designs, so much so that my copy is falling apart!! If you want to really ""take off"" and develop the freedom to be creative and confident in your knitting, GET THIS BOOK and let it live in your knitting bag."
4,Inspiration for the Timid Knitter,"This is a delightful book just to read--I know because I owned it for five years before I felt brave enough to tackle any of the projects. The story-style directions are a bit intimidating for someone just starting out, but the ""pithy directions"" are surprisingly easy to follow. I wish I hadn't waited so long to make my first Triangular Beret, but now I feel like I can do anything. If you're a new-ish knitter and want to move beyond potholders and scarves, this book is an entertaining springboard."
4,"Elizabeth Zimmermann's Knitter's Almanac (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)",A classic for a knitter. She is extremely veigh but love to read how Elizabeth writes. Patterns difficult to follow and really no pictures. The woman is a classic. She brought knitting a different way that other designers are using her methods but make their patterns a lot more easier to read.
5,Knitters are so lucky...,"...because we have Elizabeth Zimmerman's books to guide us through knitting and life. To truly appreciate her humor and gentle encouragement, one must at least wish to knit. At the knee of this great lady, not only will your work become better, so will your outlook on life."
5,Elizabeth Zimmerman,"A typically wonderful book from the doyenne of modern knitting. Her verve, common sense, and sense of humor will probably never be equaled!"
3,Knitter's Almanac by Elizabeth Zimmerman,Received book in a timely manner. The book was received from the seller exactly as described. The book is an older copy but still has very relevant information for knitters. The writer explains how to knit a one row buttonhole.
4,absorbing stuff,"Everyone has raved about EZ and I resisted for a while until it too difficult to ignore any longer. So, I decided that the Knitter's Almanac would be my first EZ. It is like sitting next to a favorite aunt who takes knitting as a total creative experience to be considered and worked on as though you were creating something for yourself and not because someone has written a pattern and decreed how it should be. You can take this spirit and feel liberated in a way. I shall probably buy another book about working in the round....."
4,Getting to know Elizabeth Zimmerman,"The book is a really enchanting introduction to the work of Elizabeth Zimmerman. Before needing to buy this title for a Knitalong, I had never heard of this knitter. I'm so glad I bought the book, since I find myself learning more about knitting as I read."
1,BE CAREFUL - Received TWO of these from Amazon not compatible in US,"This is a wonderful concert which I have on VHS. However, I've ordered TWICE on DVD from Amazon and both times I have received DVD's not compatible for play in the U.S. BUYER BEWARE."
4,Brides Bite is Best of the Bunch!,"Though often overlooked as the second in the Dracula series (It doesn't have Christoper Lee). This film might be the best of the bunch. We find a well intentioned young girl going to teach in the Transylvanian countryside, her path crosses with an apparently well to do older woman who invites the girl to spend the evening at her castle. There she encounters the woman's son, Baron Mienster (David Peele), Chained and held prisoner in the castle by his mother. Meaning well the girl sets the fast talking undead free. After he sets his mother straight, it's off to the country...in search of blood. Peter Cushing has his second go, in one of his most famous roles, as Dr. Van Helsing. With the kill of the daddy of all vampires under his belt, Van Helsing is off to slaughter the whole group of nasty nosferatus. Lots of color, cleavage, and crosses. Great fun! Leaves you with a little chill and a want to see it again. Too bad it's not widescreen."
1,Not 1000ma capacity!,"I got this converter solely because it claims to have 1000ma capacity, as I had previously ordered one that was not powerful enough, and it had 500ma capacity. However, whenever I got the package, right on the box it tells you never to exceed 600ma for this converter. It does not have 1000ma capacity, they are lying to you."
1,Didn't work,"Bought two of these to use for some small fans. Converter didn't provide the amps stated in the product desription, barely enough amps to run the fan on LOW and still at that wasn't enough power to get much air movement. Returned both items."
3,not what I expected,"I was hoping this would work with some props I made for Halloween. An adapter I had in the past worked fine, but this one doesnt have enough amps to support the dc motor. It works fine for what it was developed for, phones, ipods, etc. It looked like the one I had that worked. So, nothing wrong with this product, just wasnt what I needed."
5,Great Product,"Excellent product, does everything I hoped. The only issue that I have is that my car jack is a little loose inside, but that could be from my zune and not the converter. I use this for my zune and my cell!"
1,Really disappointing.,"A venerable techno outfit pairs up with Terrence McKenna, venerable psychedelic sage, to whip up an album. How can it go wrong?You'd be surprised.I'm an ambient music fan too, so believe me when I say I have a high tolerance for tedium. But this album offers no sonic innovation, no driving groove, no emotion. None. It trots out some uninspired rap stylings that just plod along in a kind of formulaic rave, and it does so to backbeats that wouldn't be out of place at a kid's birthday party. It's a wet noodle.The high point of the whole deal is when Mr. McKenna gets his chance, but he seems oddly unenthusiastic and the music his rap is set to is more of the same soggy gunk on the rest of the album. I can't recommend paying more than three or four bucks for this. It's nothing special--in fact, it's a bummer."
2,SIXER IS A JOKE COMPARED TO ANN BERETTA,"ANN BERETTA CONTINUES TO PUT OUT GREAT ALBUMS WHILE CHRIS AND LEER'S ""SIXER""- DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE NAME, JUST COMES OUT WITH REDNECK CRAP, AND LATELY NOTHING HAS BEEN HEARD ABOUT EM. ROB AND RUSS ARE BETTER OFF WITHOUT YOU, GOOD RIDANCE. OH AND BY THE WAY THE REVIEW ABOVE MINE, BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR- I HOPE THAT WAS SARCASM OR YOU HAVE NO TASTE IN GOOD MUSIC"
3,"Poor video quality, get the DVD",I was expecting much better quality (i.e. close to DVD quality) and didn't get it.. It's probably close to 360/480 quality. The DVD is essentially the same price except for shipping. Go with the DVD over the instant video.
4,"Fun, Quirky","Great, engaging show for kids with an enormous amount of musicality to it. Covers same subjects most kids' shows do -- sharing is good, no pushing, brush your teeth, etc. -- but in a super quirky manner."
4,Yummy in my tummy,"It will dazzle and keep your child entertained no matter how many times they have seen it.The Gabba gang (Life sized puppets) sing, dance and teach children to high-five and be polite.Good for 1 to 3 years old. First show my toddler really liked.It's like a mixture of Barney and the old Sesame Street with a faster pace.Much better than Barney but less educational than Sesame Street.It's cool, hip, very musical and has lots of cartoon clips alternatingwith the Gabba characters. Kids love this show. Big hit since Blue's Clues.my other recommendations:1-3 year old:yo gabba gabbapingublue's cluesmaisyoswaldharold and the purple crayon2-5 year old:kipper the dog64 zoo lanecurious georgemaggie and the ferocious beast3-6 year old:george and martha (HBO)madeleinelittle bearfranklinwinnie the poohpeanuts5-8foster's home for imaginary friendssponge bobmagic school busFraggle Rock"
1,Accidentally bought this and there's not a way to return it,"I have Amazon Prime, so I sometimes play Yo Gabba Gabba for my children. I accidentally purchased this episode and can see no way to reverse the transaction. Obviously I had no intention of buying it since I can play it for free any time."
2,Turbocad Deluxe 9 with Floorplan 8 Bundle,I found the FloorPlan 8 easy to use...but Turbocad is completely useless to me without a user guide or manual. It is not user friendly in any respect. Even the Help section is no help at all.I'll try to locate a printed 'how-to' guide before I give up. It may be great for an experienced architect...but I need a computer course to figure out how to use the program.
2,Looks like a good program but has a POOR manual,"I picked this up so I could create 2-D and 3-D drawings of furniture (among other things). It's hard enough to understand CAD. It's even harder without a tutorial or a guide to cover the basics. The manual is packed with data but it assumes that you already know all you need to know about CAD.Being a software developer for many years, I find it bothersome to purchase a program that does not provide a set of basic lessons for those people who are not experts. I find it irritating.If it contained a nice basic tutorial, it would be much more useful. As it is, I installed the program, read what I could of the manual, searched a great deal through the web site (imsi) and found little to nothing on how to get from point A (a concept) to point B (a drawing)."
1,CAD,I agree with the comments by other users. I still havent found a basic tutorial to understand this program. Its very disapointing. I want to draw but its so complicated I will just use a peice of paper to do my drawing.Dont buy Turbo CAD
2,not so much,"now admitttedly i am impatient, but i found this product to be unweildy and unfriendly. i had been using broderbund's ""instant architect"" (which was soooo excellent) for years until a change in operating systems forced me to find an alternative. after several attempts to make it productive, i've given up. i no longer have it installed on my machine."
4,good knife,"Fantastic blade, though I do wish that handle had some sort of synthetic cover so it would provide a better grip. Also the tip is slightly prone to snapping off, but Spyderco fixed for a small fee."
4,"Excellent knife, but a bot too long","I am really happy with my Spyderco Harpy. Like all Spyderco products, the workmanship is excellent. The spring clip lets the knife rest in your pocket but be easily accessible (or you can remove the clip to make the knife flatter in your pocket.) This is the knife that Hannibal Lecter used to thwart the pickpocket and gut the corrupt official in the book HANNIBAL. One gripe: at 3.75"", the blade is too long for everyday carrying in many cities that have knife ordinances (3"" max.) Better safe than sorry... check your local laws."
5,spyderco quality,"excellent value,well worth the money.blade is high tec. steel,takes a fine edge.workmanship is top notch.this knife will last a lifetime."
4,"Excellent, but should be a little bit better to get 5 stars","I've been listening to Bensusan for 13 years or so, and have most of his albums. There's no singing on this album (to me, that's a good thing). I've always enjoyed his covers of traditional celtic and Irish music more than his originals. This album is almost entirely (if not all) originals. Personal preference only - I'd have given 5 stars if there were more traditional pieces."
4,Nice CD!,"Pierre Bensusan CD is a very nice CD, just as the title suggests ""Nice Feeling"". I've purchased it, and am very happy with what I hear. I found another really good CD at GuitarSolo.com by Robert Dillon, He's a new guitarist entering the scene, and I have a feeling after listening to his mp3 soundfiles of his debut CD, he will do very well in this business!...Dave"
4,Jammin in Arkansas,I priced similar products at local audio/electronic stores... Not really satisfied with the limited selection there.... Much larger selection and great prices at Amazon.... These suited my needs to hold a fairly large bookshelf speaker and much too my surprise matched the speaker black wrinkle paint finish perfectly.....Very happy!!!
4,Great Speak Stands,These stands are great for a medium sized bookshelf speakers. Especially if you have black furniture. It really blends well. 1 con though: after assembly and sitting for some time i noticed stress cracks where the screws are driven in....this is most likely a quality issue so i dropped a star.
3,Wobbly,"I was not really impressed with these, sure they did the job and got the speakers up higher but thye are very easy to tip. I did not return them because I had to have them immediatly. I would not buy them again."
2,Poor quality but works okay.,"Once the stands are together, they work okay--it's the construction process that's frustrating. Even though I had read several online reviews that warned against screwing the top and bottom plates too firmly into place, I couldn't believe how little effort it took to split the wood on the uprights. And I was being careful!!! I had to disassemble the thing, add wood glue, put on a clamp, and then revisit the situation after the glue had dried. Very high annoyance factor. But, as I said, they do work once they're together and are, in fact, more stable than I thought they'd be. That's why they get a second star."
4,Excellent Product for the Price,The speaker stands are easy to put together and are very sturdy. They look great and at the price they are hard to beat- strongly recommended.
4,Good for price,"SANUS SYSTEMS BF-31B Wood Speaker StandsBought two pairs of these to highten my bookshelf speakers. Everything went together pretty easy. Some cracks in the wood when tightening the srews. Spikes are too big and couldn't get two stands through the carpet into the floor. I didn't put the slats on the back to hide the speaker wire, tape works just as good. Stands look good. If you're on a budget, these stands are perfect for the price. If you have a bigger budget, I'd research and go with a more expensive stand. I am happy overall with them."
2,Fragile at best,"I had the same issue with splitting as other reviewers had. The material they're made out of seems like big thick cardboard. I even went as far as to drill out the pilot holes for the screws a bit more to solve the issue so I could use the stands. They work and they look good, but they're so shoddily made I can't really recommend them."
1,waste of money,"i purchased to accent my new speaker system, unfortunatley there junk. once the screw was put in the wood immediatley split."
2,Review,Looks good but when I was putting it together the wood split. I was pretty disappointed. Other than that it is good. It looks great but splits easily. I would recommend spending the extra money and getting a better one.
3,Inexpensive...and cheap.,"These are inexpensive stands...and for a good reason. They are made with a 'coated' MDF. I have assembled many similar items, but I have never seen something where the MDF (stand upright/vertical portion) would 'split' so easily. Directions say to not overtighten the screws and I cannot stress enough how important that is. The MDF will split in an instant. Particularly, right at the front edge of the vertical portion. They do serve the purpose for an inexpensive stand...but good luck on the assembly. You may need it!!"
3,"Almost perfect, but ....","...one of the slats had a split in the screw hole. I was anxious to install these before a gathering, so it wasn't feasible or worthwhile to return the entire package. The defect is not noticeable and there are 5 other screws holding the stand together, making it perfectly sound and solid. Still, it speaks to a lack of quality control at Sanus. Other than that, I love them. Exactly what I was looking for, at a price that could not be beat. Other than the screw hole defect, the wood was perfectly finished."
1,JUNK<JUNK<JUNK,"These stands are of extremely poor design,when i put them together with a manual screwdriver the ends of the uprights simply split in half.this happened with both stands,top and bottom even though I was much more carefull with the second stand.Junk"
3,these were ok stands for the price,"these speaker stands were good for the price. The particle board was VERY low quality.and yes, everyone that commmented that the wood will split when you screw together the 2 pieces of wood. They are right, they do. I read the reviews very carefully before I bought, and went ahead anyways.==> one word of caution is , I tried to put on the spikes at the bottom of the stand, and no matter how hard I twist or try to push them in, they would not go in. Finally I decided I did not need the spikes. I when I tried to pull one out (that I was able to get it) it broke off in half!!! Not good..."
2,Aweful,Pre-drilled holes don't line up at all. And with it being made of cheap particle board it split as soon as the screws were turned. Would not recommend for use. Says it can hold up to 15lbs but I wouldn't trust it with that much. Don't know about their other products but I would pass on this one at least.
3,Poor Construction/ Cheaply made,"I decided to get these for my two side speakers for my Onkyo-6200 HTIB...and this is probably one of the few times the phrase ""you get what you paid for"" applies to Amazon. I decided to take advantage of the price drop and sorry I did.The product description includes ""a built-in concealed wire path hides speaker cables for a clean and organized appearance in any room"" This is basically a plastic panel that you have to squeeze into the grooves on the wood.After several attempts at lining up the two pieces of the frame....it still left a gap in the front.Again, I have to use the phrase: ""you get what you pay for"""
2,Poor Quality..You pay what u get!,i bought these stands because of its price. I was going to buy some stands that make out of steel about 120. I really regret buying this stands. The wood is so cheap that it breaks when I screw them together. I can see cracks on them already where the screws are!!! However You wont see it unless u are very close to it. Dont even waste ur money and these stands only works for small speakers. It wont even work on bookshelf speakers. The wood where the speaker sits are so small!
3,Decent,Yeah they have some cheap materials in them. and the layout for the speaker wire hiding makes no sense. (IE the speaker has to sit on the actual wire in some cases to get it to the hole below it. It also was annoying to assemble and took multiple tries. But it does get the job done if you need them. I am of the philosophy that the speaker stand should never cost more than the individual speaker it is holding so this one fit the bill.
4,SANUS SYSTEMS BF-31B,Great product. Easy to install and hides wires very well. Only took 20 min. to put together! Only comes with carpet spikes though which is a serious minus as I have hardwood floors!
1,CHEAP JUNK... AVOID THESE,"THIS PRODUCT IS CHEAP JUNK! THE INSTUCTIONS ARE PICTURES ONLY...POORLY DESIGNED WITH A SMALL HOLE FOR SPEAKER WIRE...YOU WILL HAVE TO DRILL IT BIGGER FOR WIRE 16 GAUGE OR LARGER.... HAD TO SAW THROUGH THE BACK TO CREAT A GROOVE FOR THE WIRE, SINCE NO SPEAKER I KNOW HAVE A CONNECTION ON THE BOTTOM...ONCE ALL THAT IS DONE THERE IS NO WAY TO SECURE THE SPEAKER TO THE STAND, IMAGINE YOUR $250 SPEAKER BEING BUMPED AND THE SPEAKER CRASHING TO THE HARD FLOOR. i EVEN THOUGHT GLUEING THE SPEAKERS TO THE STAND, BUT NO WAY....i TOSSED THIS CRAPPY PRODUCT...WENT to Ross discount store bought two 48"" pedestals that works perfectly for $19.99 I WASTED $36.00 AND 2 HOURS..... warning stay away!"
4,Will do their job.,"I own these stands and a pair of the 24 inch versions. These BF-31B's are being used to support Polk Audio Monitor 30 speakers and they do their job without pain or glory. I did fasten those speakers with industrial velcro pads as a precaution. Those wondering about the assembly method, I can confirm that it can be done safely(no cracks, no splinters) using an old school manual screwdriver.Nice for the price."
4,Good for the price,"An adequate stand for small speakers. I used them for the front L/R speakers on a modest 7.1 surround sound system. Used on carpet, they are sufficiently stable that our cats have not knocked them over (yet!) and apparently not interesting as scratching posts. They are not, however, as stable as I'd like for a stand this tall; I'm considering finding a way add weight to the base without adding ugly to my living room. I'm sure the design works fine for a shorter stand.Also, when the instructions say ""No Power Tools!"", they are not kidding. The manufactured wood splits very easily when putting in screws. However, once assembled, any damage caused by my overzealous overtightening of screws was hidden and did not seem to effect rigidity/stability. The stands are reasonably attractive (or, perhaps, simply unobtrusive). They were also quite inexpensive. I would buy a Sanus stand again...but perhaps spring for a higher quality one."
4,Look good; good value,"The main thing I want to caution is that the particle wood is so soft that it's very easy to screw into the wrong point, where there are no pre-drilled holes. But if you do that, the wood will likely split which is what happened to me. Fortunately it wasn't so noticeable after I took the screw out and put it in the right place. So be careful to put the screws into the pre-drilled holes.Other than that, they are exactly what I was looking for. Inexpensive speaker stands. As others have noticed, the hole at the top is probably useless for most people but the speaker wire can be ran out the back and around to the speaker."
5,These Will Split Very Very Easily - Be Careful When Putting Together!!,"I ended up with a hairline split at the bottom of one of mine. Was taking my time with using quarter-turns and then with the slightest - and I mean slightest pressure - the hairline crack appeared before my eyes. When you feel or see the first contact of both boards that you are screwing together - STOP - or you will split the boards.I have carpet and had to use the plastic spikes on the bottom of these. Unless you, your kid or your dog actually run into these, they will not fall over. Just keep that in mind. I would definately not have kids around these.For the price of 35 with no tax and free shipping you cannot beat these. They look good and serve their purpose."
5,Great stands for the price,"Of course they are not real wood, but for the price they look great. To all who say the wood cracks, take it easy! Went together perfectly. To all who say the screw heads stick out, you put it together wrong! Read the instructions. Screw holes are scooped out for nice level surface. I did spray on an extra coat of black paint and use double back tape to secure my awesome Bose speakers. But small price to pay for the perfect finish to our new entertainment system. And FYI, Amazon is consistently the best marketplace on the internet."
4,Very good for the money you pay,"Yes, these are cheaply made but they are very good for the money you pay for them. I needed a cheap pair of stands for a pair of small bookshelf speakers Energy CB-5) and these stands do the job very well. They are pretty sturdy and look decent. I didn't have the wood splitting problem that some others have said. I am very happy with them and I would have given them a 5 star rating if the spikes would actually fit into the holes.Definitely recommend them if you need a pair of cheap stands for smaller bookshelf speakers."
4,The stands are cheap but look great,"The stands seem to be ok. They're made out of cheap material but they're able to do what they're made for, which is to hold your speaker.When putting the stands together, make sure you're very careful. They seem to crack very easy. There's no need to over tightern the bolt. Just tight them enough to be flush with the groove. Also, the spike are hard to put in. What worked for me was to put the spikes in a little and then place it on the floor and lean on the board.Anyways, the stands are pretty good and i would buy again."
5,Upgrade to Amazon's description of this item.,"FYI here are some product details not specified on Amazon's description. I did not realize these are only designed for smaller bookshelf speakers. Up to 15 lbs. The 24"" stand has a 7.5"" by 7.5"" speaker base so it can handle a bigger speaker. I really needed the bigger base.Model # BF31bPackage DimensionsBlack W = 30""D = 10""H = 3""Product DimensionsW = 11.5""D = 11""H = 31""31"" tall with 5""x5"" top plate for small bookshelf speakers"
4,Very good product.,"I just received these yesterday, so my review is based on first impressions, but I believe they will suit my uses perfectly.They look nice, seem sturdy enough, and are light. I only have 2 complaints: the surface the speaker sits on is only 5 inch square, and the ""wire management hole"" on the top plate barely accepts 16ga wire, but if you do get the wire through it causes your speaker to wobble. My advice, don't use that hole. For $40 these are non-issues for me.Just be warned, when assembling these units start from the base up. Don't follow the instructions. 1. put the carpet spikes in, 2. hand start all the screws in the base, 3. put the speaker wire through the hole in the base, 4. screw in the long pieces of wood, 5. put in the back plastic pieces before putting the top part in, and 6. screw in the top. Oh, and the main thing is DON'T OVER-TIGHTEN THE SCREWS. The ""wood"" will split."
3,Doesn't hide the cables!,"They made a very strange choice in the design of these speaker stands!The vertical piece that gives these stands their height is actually two pieces of wood placed next to each other, forming a V shape. The speaker wires run up between these two pieces. To hide the cables from the rear view, there is a thin piece of black plastic used to cover the back side. But here's the strange part: in the front, those two parallel vertical pieces of wood do not touch... there's a gap of about 1/4 inch at the tip of the ""V"" they form. Through this 1/4"" gap, you can easily see the speaker wire running up the vertical leg of the speaker stand. It's tacky!Paint your speaker wire black, or use some black electrical tape to hide the speaker wires inside the speaker stand so that the wires are not so visible."
1,Stay Away From These...,"This is MISLEADING...""Wood Speaker Stands""...this is some sort of horrible, compressed core laminate...It is a pain in the butt to assemble and if you can not line up the holes perfectly, you will end up splitting the crappy material that these things are made of.If you do buy them, keep four toothpicks handy when you assemble these. Insert the tooth picks in the pre drilled holes of the vertical supports, in order to line them up with the holes in the base plate and top plate. even then, be very careful.In short, this product is TOTAL GARBAGE."
3,Speaker Stands,"I am very pleased with these stands. They are well made, sturdy and look great in our family room."
3,Assembly a little difficult without splitting wood,The speaker stands are reasonably priced. I wish there were more options available on wood stains but they go well with my pioneer speakers. I have assembled a lot of wood products and these are almost impossible to assemble without splitting wood. I managed to hide the split with a permanent marker and don't believe it effected the integrity of the speaker stands.
4,Sanus Wood Stands,Got these in a couple of days and they were very easy to install. They are sleek and awesome looking. They are the exact height I was looking for. The one thing I would change on these is the small stand that the speaker sits on. It really needs to be 2x the size it is now.
5,Nice Speaker Stands,"Regardless of what some others have said, these are rugged sturdy stands. They are solidly built and look very nice. they are very easy to assemble. Sure they are particle board, but they have a nice finish on them. One of the reviewers complained about the space between the 2 vertical pieces that form a ""V"". Yes there is a space between them, but included in the box are black plastic covers that slide into grooves on the back to cover any light that shines through.Overall for a little over $30, you can't beat these stands."
4,Very Satisfied! USE TOOTHPICKS,"I wasnt sure what to expect seeing the mixed reviews here but dont hesitate to buy them! Very inexpensive but work extremely well for their pupose, which is just to stand there.The most important thing is to take your time while assembling and make sure things are correct before any screws are installed. Toothpicks work great, makes it less of a chore lining up the holes. Just put toothpicks in the holes and slide the other piece over the toothpicks so all holes are in line and then screw them in one by one.After all is complete, they look very sharp and more expensive than what you paid, and you dont think about them ever again (which is a good thing). Dont use the included soft pads, use high quality 3m poster hanging goo. works great"
2,Particle Wood cheap stands,"I don't write many reviews on here, so please take this to heart . . . These stands are horrible. They look NOTHING like the picture, and are very poorly made. The fit and finish is something that left a lot to be desired. These things could barely hold anything heavy weighted (Monitor 30's) and forget about moving them around without breaking.I have to hand it to amazon though, they refunded me the $$ in 2 days! Will end up buying something stronger and better looking."
5,Excellent Speaker Stands,Ordered these after reading so many positive reviews. The package came sooner than I expected! I must say that the instructions weren't needed as the construction is very basic and simple to understand. A simple hand screwdriver is all that is needed as indicated in many reviews. No problems at all and it looks very nice. Take your time and do it right. I highly recommend this product for the budget-minded consumer.
3,It is what it is,"I bought three pairs for my hefty 7.1 onkyo surround sound. The 31"" was probably a little bigger than what I should've gotten. But it works. The base is pretty big and I don't quite like that feature but then again the stands are probably meant to hold heavier stands.We didn't have any trouble putting it together or with its stability. I was surprised to know that the speakers just sit on top of it and was worried about tipping the speakers over because the little sticky pads that are supposed to hold the speakers in place fell off before I put the speakers on. To secure the speakers in place. We ended up putting a thin screw through the top of the speaker stand to wedge the speaker in place.The quality isn't going to blow your socks off but I think it's a good product for the price."
3,"good deal, low quality",they material appears nice but cracks easy when assembling with the provided screws. See pictures from other users.great price though.
4,Great but a few issues,Cosmetically they look great. They are holding Polk Monitor 30's for me and have not yet fallen. The reason for taking off a star is of course (like lots of people are saying) the cracking. I used a normal screwdriver with very little extra tightening and still suffered a crack in one of the posts. It's dumb luck if you can put these together without making at least 1 crack in the wood. It's easy enough to cover up with some paint but it's still a pain. One of my stands is also a bit uneven on a wood floor but not a big deal.I have cats and they have yet to knock my speakers off the stands due to this stuff (which I heavily recommend):Blu-Tack Re-usable Adhesive
3,Meh,"These stands are simply OK.They look OK.My speakers fit OK.The wood used is OK. (Don't use a powered screwdriver like I did.)The carpet spikes are OK. (Don't try to force them by hand like I did at first. Use a hammer like I did later. Do not hit your hand with the hammer like I did.)I don't like the instructions, but the design is basic enough that you don't need them.I don't like how the backs pop in. (This is the cheapest part of the stands.)I don't like where the hole is to ""hide"" the speaker wire.Do they do the job? Yes.Would I recommend them? No."
2,Cheap because they are Cheaply Made,"I bought these because I thought they would be a good fit for my home theater speakers, which they are but putting these things together was a terrible experience. I split the wood on both trying to line up the parts and screw them together. I am pretty handy around the house and with tools but this was insane. There is no good way to see if the parts are lined up just right and if you are off by just a little, the wood is so cheap that the screw begins to split it open. The entire experience was frustrating. There is a reason these are so cheap; it is because they are so cheaply made. I cannot recommend these to anyone."
2,Would be one star but they're dirt cheap,"The saying is true - you get what you pay for. These are very cheaply made. I screwed the bases in place and the legs began easily splitting down the middle...this didn't affect the stability of the stand though. I feel bad giving them a poor review since they'll do the job and if you're even bothering to look at them you're basically looking for an upgrade over the stack of phonebooks you're currently using. So in the end, are they total crap? absolutely. Will they hold your speakers? sure. If you want something nice, pay for something nice."
2,Cheap is the word,"If you want cheap speaker stands - these are the ones to buy. However,if you expect to move them reguarly - like to vacuum around them - I'davoid them. The spikes break off easily, leaving you with a cockeyedspeaker."
4,Great deal for low end stands,"After reading other reviews, I decided to go ahead and get these. Especially for what they cost, they get the job done. Like another reviewer stated, make sure to hammer the carpet spikes into the base before doing anything else. Take your time assembling them. Drive the screws in just enough to stick out of the top and bottom pieces and then line them up with the holes in the supports before driving them in the rest of the way. Otherwise, you will risk splitting the wood (or whatever you call what they are made out of). After assembly, be careful when moving them on carpet or you can easily snap the spikes off (it happened to me). My stands are partially hidden behind some furniture so they are not that noticable. If yours are going to be out in the open, you may want to spring for a higher end model."
2,Not that great.,"You are getting what you pay for. They look nice when I pulled them out of the box, my hopes were very high. Three of the four riser ends split when I screwed them into the rectange pieces. And I work with wood quite often so I know not to over tighten. Just a low quality design with the material used. Gave them to my kid for his room, quality was good enough for a kids room, not for my den."
3,They get the job done,while putting them together I was a little careless and cracked the wood wile putting the screws into one.Once out together however they are pretty sturdy and stable and look pretty nice.They give a little better ambiance then the metal pole stands.
3,you get what you pay for,"Sanus has an all around reputation for the accessory world of electronic products. i chose budget stands to hold up my 11 pound Klipsch 3 way speakers. they are awkwardly heavy and off-balanced being a little front biased. These sanus stands do however work absolutely great for the price. putting them together, i did notice as i was using my 14v drill to send the wood screws to connect the base to legs, there would be a hairline crack that went about 2"" up from the wood screw. This is as everyone says, a composite fiberboard, which suffices in looks and is sturdy enough, but watch how far and hard you drill in the screws because you risk splitting the board into two. instead of using the supplied bolts to hold down the speakers, i actually went with mounting squares (think highway fast pass mounting tabs) which are quick removable, and allow for free positioning (since my surrounds are front weight biased..)"
3,Rather strange...,"I just happened to grab this book off of the shelf in one of my used book runs. I'm not quite sure if I was lucky or cursed. It begins with our two ""fine"" characters: Harriette and Ed. Ed proposes to Harriette one night after getting drunk. Harriette, who doesn't particularly like Ed, agrees because she dreams of having a wonderful romantic husband. In other words-Harriette is living in a fairytale. It gets steadily worse from there as Ed is just a sick abusive man. Then it gets even worse when they have their first child-Harry. Ed throws Harry up against the wall and he's never the same. He starts murdering local pets and then progresses on to humans... Read this book to see what happens to Harry. Or don't read it and spare yourself the nightmares. A book for adventurous folk."
2,Has anyone associated with this book heard of an editor?,"Not a bad story as far as horror goes, but the real horror was that a book could be published with such an absurd amount of errors. Almost every other page had typos, repeated sections, or misplaced paragraphs. There were quotes from the wrong characters in the same paragraph as another character. How many times can the word finger be spelled fetger? After a while, all these errors became very distracting from the story. My red pen ran dry half way through the book!Was this review helpful?"
2,?,"I had always been interested in this book. It was ok but too weird, about a psychotic youngster. Get it if you like this sort of thing. You might find something to like about it. Definitely not for the squeamish."
1,Hard Drive crashed - all data gone,"I bought this product 6 months ago and I just turned it on, and my computer wont recognize the hard drive, and the hard drive is making funny noises. Basically, my data is lost forever. I contacted seagate, and they said if I want a data recovery, it will cost $1,800. This was supposed to be a backup to my computer, but my computer has been more reliable than this junk!"
2,Mixed up tea Party,"The is a story of 2 pies, two friends and a tea party that's full of mixed up pies.Honestly, this is one story that's hard to actually to keep up with but what the heck, it has beautiful illustration to make it up for. The plot however failed to grip me in the roots."
2,Not what it use to be,I use to buy this product all the time when in was available in the U.S because it would look natural and would hold all day. I have very straight eyelashes. This mascara use to be the only one that would hold the shape of my curled eyelashes….not any more : (
4,Thouroghly Engaging Light Comedy,"I really enjoyed this light comedy, and it's one of those independent films where I didn't have one finger on the fast forward button for half the movie. It's basically about a straight guy who spends the entire movie trying to convince everyone in his life that he is not Gay. I can really relate to that since I spent 24 years doing it myself. His brother tricks him into thinking he has a coffee date with a female, only to wind up finding it's a guy waiting to meet him. His Gay date is played by the cute Latino actor, Wilson Cruz. Coffee Date is the not the kind of film that I would be inclined to watch over and over again. Once you see it and enjoy the story, there's not much need to see it again anytime soon. However, I think it's a great addition to my film library, and I will watch it again at some future point with friends whom I think would enjoy it for the first time."
3,Original and funny!,"This movie is super cute and interesting. Like most queer cinema, the production quality is less than stellar, but the story is fun and original, there are several laugh-out-loud moments, and it explores straight/gay male friendships in a way that I've never seen before! I highly recommend giving Coffee Date a watch!"
4,Good Movie,This was a good movie about different kinds of love. I guess I thought that true love would win out in the end but I guess it doesn't always happen. I really wished for a different ending. I still would buy this movie.
4,Best Movie I've Seen In A LONG Time,"Like I said it's the best Wilson steals the show, you just can't wait to see what he's going to say next and the mother wouldn't we all love to have a mother so accepting this movie made me laugh all the way through as Johnathan mucking his way through his ""relationships"" the only reason for 4 stars is I wish the movie had closed caption and I had to return cause both me and a friend bought this and the film skipped in 2 of the same places but the film is worth it I will be getting it again."
3,Light entertainment with a cup of coffee in the background,"I must admit I started watching this one with a sense of doubt and I prayed it wouldn't be another trivial gay comedy. But, hey, this one is quite o.k.The plot is acceptable, the acting doesn't hurt the viewers (with exception for JOnathan Silverman, which is kinda boring as jealous and lousy bro)If you have chance, rent it."
5,AWESOME MOVIE!!!,"Awesome movie, I loved it, it was sooo fuuuunnnyyyy. Debbie Gibson did a great job playing a small role. Gay noy gay, you got to see this. Its not dirty but very sweet."
5,A Sweet Surprise,"What a delightful, charming and refreshing look at gay/straight/friendship/love relationships. There were SO many opportunities for cliche that I couldn't help but sit on the edge of my seat just waiting for them to happen. But they never came. I was constantly surprised at how well the writers (and the truly endearing leads) wandered into situations that could have been simply rehashes of the standard old dreck and yet with a surprising earnestness, a genuine humanity and the kind of subtlety rarely seen in the genre managed to make them seem natural, believable and actually quite touching. And the chemistry between the leads is so palpable that it totally works. This is now officially in my top 10 favorite gay movies."
3,Copy protected version is WMA only,"The 2005 release of this CD is a copy protected version, providing .wma files accessible only under Windows Media Player. These files will be usable only on an mp3 player that accepts WMA files. According to the EMI Jean-Louis Aubert site, the CD was re-released in 2006, in a version without copy protection, acceptable by all mp3 players. The 2006 version can be recognized by the black sticker across the bottom. It appears that the 2006 version offers one additional cut, a live version of the new song Parle-moi."
4,Where's Some Like It Hot,"Sunset Blvd...Absolutely, Sabrina...Of course, Stalag 17...Maybe. But why no Some Like It Hot. Afterall The AFI voted this one their all-time favorite comedy and it certainly warrants high acclaim by both critics and film buffs alike for more than 50 years. Marilyn was suberb as Sugarcane, in her very best role ever.Anyway, Billy Wilder left us with some absolute gems and here are three reasons to admire his wit and cinimatic genius. I'll leave you with one of his funnest jokes..An elderly man goes to see his Doctor...DR, ""What brings you here today. Elderly Gent, ""I'm having trouble peeing"". DR, ""How old are you?"" E.G. ""I'm 93"". DR, ""Don't worry. You've peed enough!"""
5,The Wild Billy Wilder,"The movies chosen to present this trio of Wilder films are all excellent in their own genre. Not only are Sunset Blvd., Stalag 17, and Sabrina ""true classics"",but the extra bonus featurestake you inside the set and inside the mind of Billy Wilder. The well spoken narrative on all three films is not only intelligent but enlightening as well. You can really benefit by watching all three films ""as they are"", but then againWITH the narrative because it is then that you learn how Wilder worked and got the best performances out of his splendid cast of actors. The astonishing performance of the 50ish Gloria Swanson in Sunset Blvd. is trulyamazing in itself. Of the three THAT one's my personal favorite.William Holden fans will be delighted to know that he is in all three movies!! Was there any sweeter girl than Audrey Hepburn (Sabrina)? She wins your heart as does the character in that movie played by Humphrey Bogart whose subtle turn is quite noteworthy."
4,"Overall, these supports are better than the factory ones!","These supports are better than the factory ones. When I ordered these, I ordered the wrong ones and was just excited that I was not paying an arm/leg for them; they were wrong. I even installed them and then found out they did not work. It is my own fault, but they are still brand new."
5,MashaAllah TabarakaAllah! Every house Muslim household should have one!,"AssalaamoAlaikum wa Rahmatulli wa BarakatuhThis book is sooooo difficult to find in the UK. I have one that is about 5/6 years old and would LOVE to buy another.Treasure this book it is soooo valuable!EVERY Dua in it is 100% Authentic, it has brilliant Notes in it, Hadith's as proof and every Arabic word is translated.It has notes and names of Hadith reporters and the Hadith terms.Even though you can find the full book on line for personal non-profit use, we all should have a copy on hand for those times when you don't/won't have a PC in front of you.If i knew it would be so difficult to get hold of again in England i would have purchased several SubhanAllah!May Allah (swt) Reward Waleed Al-Essa and shower him with HIS mercy for compiling this book and making life easy for Muslims like myself, AMEEN!"
2,DVD was ok not it was all hyped up to be !!!!!!!!,"A few shoots of good Booty, nothing to shout about, And all the women did not look that good!!!!! it's worth $6 bucks and that's it,,, don't pay anymore for this DVD. All the fine sistas didn't even want to show any Booty"
2,This is crap!,This video sucks first and foremost and the fact that some white guy named Joe Francis is going around trying to make money of the black man and women is completely ludicrous and bullsh*t
3,Much loved doll stroller,I gave the Chicco Stroller to my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas and she really uses it. She walked her doll all the way to the playground (several city blocks) the other day. There was a bit of a problem getting the front wheels to stay on but it seems to be ok now.
3,Cute but hard to push,"Adorable, but something about the wheels makes it really hard for my kids to push this stroller. They got frustrated with it and gave up using it."
5,Larger and better quality doll stroller,"This stroller is larger, fits 18"" dolls, and more sturdy than any other doll strollers I have seen. Our 2 and 4 year play with it regularly. Absolutely worth the few extra dollars to get something that will last longer and grow with your child."
4,Great!,"I love this and so does my 18 month old girl but the only thing I realized about it is that it does not fold like the umbrella strollers for minimal storage. It just folds down in half just like the big strollers we use for our babies. But other than that it's a great buy. Sturdy and nice. A little too big for her age but I love knowing that she can grow into it... She still pushes it everywhere I only say she's a little too young because the shade canopy covers her view a little and then if it's pushed up it's even worse so Im glad I didn't buy a cheaper one because everyone says the metal bends, and the material always rips and looks crappy so I know this will never need to be replaced. I love it and so does she!"
5,Pleased Maw Maw,"I did a lot of research before making a selection on a baby doll stroller and while this one was a little more than I would have liked to spend, it had the best reviews and was worth every penny! It appears to be very sturdy and well made and the swivel wheels make it very easy to push. I can hardly wait to see my granddaughter's face when she gets this gift for her 3rd birthday. My daughter could not believe how fast it arrived. I LOVE shopping with Amazon!"
3,A tad disappointed..,"We bought this for my daughter's 2 year old birthday. I wanted a doll stroller that resembled her own and I do not like those plastic ones.... The stroller is a good height. It is super cute and the quality would be perfect EXCEPT, there is two sliding pieces on each bar that is SUPPOSE to lock the stroller in place and keep it open. The sliding pieces DO NOT stay in place so the stroller wants to close up all the time. This would be nice for maybe a short 5 year old but for a active toddler that likes to move it around alot...not good. I'm overall disappointed."
4,Great & sturdy good for older children,"I bought this stroller for my then 2-year-olds daughter. Now, she is nearly 4 and still loves it. It is sturdy and has held up to climbing and fighting as well as a 35 lbs. toddler sitting in it. All of this said, it depends on the use for this stroller. It is sturdy, but it is also taller and heavier than the average toddler stroller. This ensures that it grows well with the child and works well for an older child, however, it can be a little cumbersome for a younger/smaller child. In tighter quarters indoors, it is a little more difficult to maneuver, and my daughter sometimes favors another child's lighter weight ""cheaper"" version. This stroller works wonderfully for outside walks with mom due to the heavier rubber wheels & even a great roomy storage space underneath. Just like a mom & her regular stroller, sometimes it is nice to have the cheap ""umbrella"" stroller for lighter use but this one is a long lasting winner."
1,You could trust Narada once ...........,Self-indulgent playing made worse by poor microphone positioning. What has happened at Narada? The label in its early years would never release stuff like this. Setting standards gives you credibility. Albums like this help you lose it.
5,Hillarious Comedy,This movie is one of those films that never grow old. It's been the total hit for more than 30 years. Sparkling humour won't let you be bored. The acting is great! Phrases from the movie are now popular aphorisms! The movie arises in you the warmest feelings! Enjoy this movie!
5,A masterpiece!,"This is a clever Soviet time comedy. Acting is superb. However, it is not the American style humor. Rather, it can be compared to other European comedies of the Louis de Funes type. You may need to watch it two or three times for complete appreciation.The movie is also very educational - you learn a lot about life in the Soviet Union during the late 60-ties."
5,Just what I needed - so helpful!,"Provides a really good understanding of all the basic information you need to know before even getting on your bike. Really good for someone who's never ridden before; saves you from wasting actual riding time with your instructor(at $120+ a lesson). Also, who better to learn from than McGrath? A lot of credibility there."
3,Buy Adiemus 1 & 2 but skip #3,"Okay Karl, what is going on here? I simply fell in love and was mezmorized by Adiemus 1 & 2. There seems to have been a rush delivery for 3 and unfortunately it shows (to my ears anyway). It doesn't have the epic climaxes of Adiemus 2 or the haunting echos of Adiemus 1. I guess it's an interesting idea to have ""The Dances Theme"" going but the limitation puts a harsh cap on your abilities to let your own creativity shine through. Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty original and listenable stuff. But it doesn't come near the A list as Adiemus 2 has in my collection of CD's. Solid 3 stars."
2,Sadly rather stilted,"I think ""Adiemus 2"" is one of the best CDs in my collection, and the original ""Adiemus"" is also pretty wonderful. However, in 3, Jenkins slipped up. The beauty and grand feeling of the first two are replaced by jigs, and pretty trite ones at that. Phrases are unnecessarily repeated, and obvious hooks are run over and over to the point of distraction. And fairly frequently, the music will just bounce to a stop and then go on again, a technique that grows tired very quickly. In the service of this style, the instrumentation and vocals (which are still pristine) sound awfully contrived, even pretentious. There's some very impressive musical ability on display here, but it too often just doesn't amount to anything with emotion.I really wanted to like this album, but I just can't. There are some good moments, but it's too hard to let the sounds carry you away when you're busy rolling your eyes. Give this a miss, but run, don't walk to pick up ""Adiemus 2""."
5,Genius,"Karl Jenkins has masterfully orchestrated this music for the soul. When I originally purchased Pure Moods a few years ago, I enjoyed ""Adiemus"" so much I bought the ""Songs of Sanctuary"". I followed with this CD, and particulary liked this selection, because it seemed more full bodied than the first. I have since rounded off my collection with Adiemus II, Diamond Music, and Imagined Oceans. Karl Jenkins's music is sensational, and I look forward hearing new pieces from him."
3,"Works, but it's pretty chintzy","Couldn't find a replacement for an old Kohler sink so took a chance on this and it worked. Pros: dirt cheap, worked where other attempts failed. Cons: all plastic construction except for thin metal stamped over plastic plug and floppy rubber gasket (Kohler plugs are all metal with the plug nicely beveled and an O-ring to provide the seal.)"
5,THE rechargeables to get,"Been using the eneloop brand for a while, and absolutly love them. I've always found the idea of using rechargeables appealing, but never found them practical until the eneloop came around. You can charge these and they keep their charge while in storage -- always ready to go. Yeaa!!One of those rare products that performs exactly as it should. If you go through batteries quickly, stop wasting your money on disposables and get these.Also - check the price for the 4 pack vs. the 8 pack. Sometimes Amazon charges less for two of the 4-packs than it does for one 8-pack."
5,nice and cheap,excellent price and very good product. excactly as descrived and as show on picture. perfect arrivali would recomend the product
4,Great Choice for rechargeable batteries,"Purchased these batteries and have been very satisfied with them. After doing much research it seems like eneloop is one of the higher rated rechargeable batteries out there.[...]The above is a great link that goes over the details of why they are such a good choice for rechargeable batteries.""In A NutshellOverall, the best rechargeable AA battery is the Eneloop Pro (aka Sanyo XX Battery Powered By Eneloop). These batteries hold their charge for 12 months. They also have a high energy capacity (2500 mAh), and they perform better than similar high-capacity AAs (see my article for more information).Another good rechargeable AA is Maha's Imedion battery, which is cheaper than the Eneloop Pro (about $5 less for a pack of 4). Imedions are also low-discharge, high-capacity batteries, but they do not perform as well as the Sanyo XX (see this reviews for the details on their performance)."""
2,Needed to be recharged frequently,"These batteries were placed in a satellite TV remote control. They had to be recharged three times, while the alkaline batteries in an identical remote used with equal frequency were still going strong."
4,Eneloop battery review,Being able to install these batteries out of the box without having to charge them was really helpfull. I installed them in a portable phone and used it right away. The cost was close to conventional AAA batteries and less than half of what most retailers wanted in my area.
5,Its always ready!,"I mainly use these AAA batteries for high powered led flashlights. The main advantage of these batteries over the competition is that they can hold their charge for a long long time. Sanyo claims that the batteries will hold their charge for a year at 85% capacity but I don't think that I will be putting them to the test. I can use up a set of batteries for my flashlight in about two weeks time and then I would replace them with the ones I charged two weeks ago and they are as of full charge. I can't say the same about the other rechargables.These are great, don't have to worry if they still have a charge or not."
5,Nobody should use disposables ever again!,"The Sanyo Eneloop is what every rechargeable battery should be. Highly dependable, it holds the charge for a very long time as promised.I'm using them on many different devices, from wireless mice and keyboards to my Nikon SB-600 speedlight. Highly recommended!"
5,Sanyo eneloop batteries,The batteries came as advertised and on time. They work fine. This purchase was from Amazon. I'm learning about purchases made through sellers using Amazon. Be careful not to buy from a salvage company. I got batteries that were soaked at some point and the packaging taped.
5,Best rechargeables out there.,"Others have written better reviews than I can about this product, so I'd just like to agree that I find these to be the best rechargeables out there."
5,Great Battery and charger,I had purchased this charger and batteries after thorough study from review. This battery lasts more than 2 months in my Nikon L18 camera. I could make about 400 shots with/ without flash light in one charging.Very satisfied.
5,Eneloop Batteries,The batteries are very durable in terms of holding a`charge. I use them in a RC radio transmitter and the performance is 2X that of other batteries I've used. Battery dependability is critical in RC applications and eneloop batteries have proven to be exceptional.
4,Eneloop,"As described, ready use right from the packaging. Seems to have in-use life as good or better than the common, brand name rechargeable batteries I'd been using before."
1,expensive junk,"I purchased two packs of Eneloop AA batteries for photographic use. During the very first time I used them in my Nikon SB600 speedlight, one of the batteries ruptured. Having spent $17.50 for a four-pack of batteries I expected good quality. Unfortunately, it was $17 down the drain. The seller won't do anything because it was more than 30 days from purchase and Sanyo has not responded to my email. The only good news is that the battery juice didn't ruin my speedlight. Save your money and buy some Duracell's instead."
5,Great Products,Have used the charger and batteries for over three months now with no loss of performance or any problems of any kind. We use the batteries to run a various appliances and radios. Shipping was fast and the order was without any problems.
5,Great Bateries,My company uses wireless keyboards/mouses which means we go through a lot of batteries in a short amount of time. After purchasing the batteries my life became so much easier with purchasing orders. I never have to worry about the battery life fading too quickly. These batteries keep their charge for a long time on high use products. I have a recharger with extra batteries so I always have fully charged batteries on hand. Great product. Highly recommend.
1,Good investment?,"I had confidence in Sanyo that these pricey batteries would be a good investment. However,after a few months one or two of them leaked in a Zenith motion detector/transmitter causing the unit to be permanently damaged.After several weeks of trying, I cannot get Sanyo to respond to e-mails or telephone calls. I was hoping they would replace the motion sensor that I believe their batteries ruined.Update: Finally got Sanyo to answer their phone. They wouldn't replace the motion detector. I sent three batteries back (two from the sensing unit and 1 that had never been used but had corrosion on the pos. terminal.) They sent me a free 4-pack."
5,Loop D Loop,"This appears to be one of the best rechargeable AA batteries on the market. It is slightly less capacity (2000mah vs 2650mah) than some other types, but does deliver what it claims. I especially like its ability to hold a charge for a long period of time. This also makes it charge better, especially in solar type rechargers, because it has less internal leakage to be overcome."
4,good battery,now I can say at least they function as good as Duracell precharged ones. I test them more.
5,Best rechargeable battery yet!,"I have had several brands of rechargeable batteries, and these are by far the best, especially for our digital camera. They perform as advertised. Highly recommended!!!"
5,good battery,"Well little to say, they hold their charge longer than normal nimh batteries and they are as useful as them, i have 4 pairs and i usually charge them every 2 days, worked flawless"
5,Work GREAT,"I've had a couple sets of these for about 8 months and they work wonderfully. I love having batteries ready for me when they are needed and not having to buy and throw away batteries is a big plus.I use them in my Wii remotes and they last a long time. I keep the charger with my Wii and when the batteries need changing in the remotes, it's fast and easy to swap them out with the charged ones. I was going to get the Wii charge station, but this way I can use the batteries for other electronics, too."
3,Not bad,"I read that those batteries last longer than other batteries when it comes to loosing energy. Well, I am not sure it is true."
2,WALL CHARGER IS MUCH BETTER,"CONS: I used this product and found that it is a major drain on my laptop. The battery would deplete very quality or the battery would barely recharge this was also plugged in at the same time. And my laptop is pretty new. Whats more, it does not charge as well as a wall charger (e.g. after x hours, your batteries will be less charged than if you had plugged them in for the same amount of time).PROS:-Charges AAA as well as AA batteries (some USB chargers only charge AA)-High-quality design and material-The major positive I can think of is when you are traveling outside the United States and can't use a wall-charger (although you would probably need some kind of adapter for your laptop anyway).SUMMARY: For general use, the wall-charger is much better: it charges faster, and has four battery slots instead of two."
3,Precharged? Really?,"While the eneloop charger did charge these batteries in a relatively short amount of time, I was disappointed to find that they did *not* have a sufficient charge for use ""straight out of the package."" If Sanyo wants to use that aspect as a selling point, they would do well to make certain they can back up the claim."
3,"Work fine, but drain fast","It is good that these are rechargeable, because they are draining fast. I go these for my Apple wireless keyboard and mouse. When they arrived I went ahead and fully charged them, just for good measure. The day I started using them, my computer reported both devices as having 81% battery charge remaining (this was right after the charger said they were fully charged). They have been in use for close to 3 weeks now, and they report as being 58% charged. Note for comparison the standard Energizer batteries I had in these devices before lasted for about 10 months before dropping below 20% charged.It will be interesting to find out whether these batteries hold less of a charge and drain faster, or if this is all just a reporting problem caused by the difference between rechargeable and regular batteries."
5,Best Recharable Batteries!,"I have used several different brands of rechargeable batteries, and these Eneloops are the best I have ever used! They last a long time before they need recharged and don't seem to wear out over just a few charges. Since my initial purchase I have bought about 4 more packs of these. I haven't bought Alkaline batteries since. I love that you can use them with C and D battery housings to make them universal to fit just about any need. They are a definite buy if you have little kids whose toys go through a lot of batteries!"
4,So far so good,Batteries arrived pre-charged as advertised. I have gone 3 months of picture taking without needing a recharge so I can't comment about recharging capability yet. The batteries do seem to hold their charge longer than regular non-rechargeable batteries.
5,great batteries,Highly recommend these batteries for camera use. They are everything that they say they are. Very long lasting
5,Works good for me,"I use the batteries for the SB-600 Nikon Flash unit. First, The flash recycle is excellent. I sparingly use the flash unit so really can't comment on how much juice is in the batteries"
5,"Great batteries period,",These batteries were suggested to me by my cousin who is a photographer. I explained to him I was getting very upset at charging my old rechargables (both sets) not using them and reaching for the camera a week later only to have dead batteries again. Age I am sure was a factor for the old sets but I like the fact that these only release charge when in use. The were charged right out of the box and I have used them for over three weeks. They are a little more pricey but well worth it. I bought an extra set and charger for the wii remotes that Santa is bringing for Christmas.**** UPDATE****Now the end of October and still going strong without a recharge yet. I LOVE these batteries. I have to wait til Christmas to try the other sets in the Wii for my son.
4,another good battery,"These are fine batteries, and I use them in a camera that eats them (and, as another reviewer stated, out of the box they wouldn't start the camera), but, in my quest for the better battery, these work no better than other name brand batteries, though they're every bit as good, and you do get a snap-plastic case to hold 8 batteries."
2,Long shelf life short use life,"I purchased this item last month and recently put them in my digital camera at Christmas used them once. Tried to use it again January 16 and the indicator blinked battery low-change soon. I was expecting them to last at least half the time of their shelf life, but not so."
2,At Present.- - - - Questionabble,"These batteries were recommended to me because of the poor results provided by other brands. The advertising for eneloop says to expect 4 times the ammount of shots on a set that you recieve from alkaline batteries. On a set of four Dura Cell AA alkaline, I had been getting about 120-130 sgots. On the first try with the eneloops I got 107 shots. This is why I listed them as questionable. I will have to wait and hope that it gets beter. If not, bye bye."
2,"Great compact charger, worthless batteries","The charger is compact and quick and so far, works with my other Ni-MH rechargable batteries. However, the Sanyo ""pre charged"" rechargable batteries are worthless for my Kodak Z812 camera. They needed to be recharged right out of the box and would not keep a charge for more than 20 pictures."
5,Best rechargables I've ever used,"These batteries are the best. You can use them in anything from cameras on down to remote controls, and they don't suddenly wind up dead in a week like normal rechargeables. I highly recommend them."
2,There is no point to get these ... rather get Sanyo 2700mAh,I have Eneloop AA and Industrial Sanyo 2700mAh. I did test leaving them fully charged for 3 months at room temperature. After 3 months discharged them at 500mA rate and Eneloop had 1600mAh whereas Industrial Sanyo of 2700mAh had remaining 2400mAh @500mA discharge rate.There is no point getting Eneloops. Industrial Sanyo 2700mAh will perform better and even after 1yr or storage will have more juice left due to much higher initial capacity. And I think 2700mAh Sanyo are fairly cheaper than Eneloops.
1,TOTAL WORTHLESS CRAP GIMMICK,"After just a couple of months of use, these have turned to useless junk. They hold a charge about a week in my wireless keyboard. Other regular rechargeables I've used in the same keyboard last for several months. I put these same fully charged Sanyo Eneloop batteries in a penlight, and the light dimmed to nothing after about 30 seconds. Sanyo is selling snake oil here, friends. Buy something else. You've been warned."
1,Not What I Expected,I purchased these rechargable batteries based on the Amazon reviews and found that they do not hold their charge any longer than my other rechargable batteries. I did a comparison test. I charged my other rechargable batteries and the Eneloop rechargable batteries on the same day. I waited a month before putting the batteries in my camera. After that period of time the Eneloop batteries were just as dead as my other batteries. This morning I tried to use my camera (it's been awhile) but again both the regular and the Eneloop rechargable batteries have no charge at all. I don't know if the ones I have are defective but I certainly will not purchase this product again. I am very surprised by all of the positive reviews.
1,rechargeable batteries,"after having these batteries for about 2 months, i am totally dissatisfied.they DO NOT hold a charge, i am using them in a cordless mouse and they go DEAD after 30 minutes. I will not purchase any more of these in the future!"
2,alex j,"i received the batterys today but i was under the impression that they came with a charger. that is why i choose these.I could have gotten the same from Wal-mart,not happy with this deal"
4,Sanyo Enepoop 4 Pack AA,"The modern world is an electrified world. The Battery, in particular, profoundly changed human existence by illuminating the night and making it hospitable to a wide range of human activity, including using the toilet in the dark.The Rechargable Battery, one of the everyday conveniences that most affects our lives, next to toilet paper, was invented in 1639 by Thomhard Alva Bellas. He was neither the first nor the only person trying to invent a Rechargable Battery by watching electric eels.The electric eel (Electrophorus electricus), is an electric fish, and the only species of the genus Electrophorus. It is capable of generating powerful electric shocks, which it uses for both hunting and self-defense."
5,Hold their charge longer than any others I have owned.,"Purchased these in Sepember 2009 for my Canon digital camera. I had heard that they hold their charge much longer than other rechargeables on the market so I wanted to try them out. I am happy to report that this appears to be true. It is now more than 3 years since I purchased these and they are still functioning at a very high level. They sit idle for long periods - sometimes 3 or 4 months - but still seem to retain the power to operate whatever device I put them in. In my opinion (be advised that I am in no way an expert), until some other better technology comes along, these appear to offer the best available performance in rechargeable batteries."
5,The batteries that the Duracell bunnies lust after,"Well you've probably seen those ads with the Duracell bunnies jumping around now haven't you? Well guess what powers the lights, camera, mics, mixers and all the other stuff that is required to make that ad? If you said Eneloop; you said right.Excellent battery, have been using in my camera for the last 6 months without recharging. The previous energizers I used would die out in 1.5 months and wouldn't hold charge after around 1 yr."
3,not sure how good they are,"I got the camera and batteries for Christmas. I used these batteries out of the package, they were supposed to be precharged. I took about 20 pictures and they went dead. after charging the batteries, I installed them in the camera, and about 10 days later when I went to use the camera, the battery indicator said the batteries were about 1/2 charged. they are still taking pictures, but I don't know how far to trust the indicator for the batteries."
2,Hard to Believe they are New,"I was not very happy with these batteries. They were supposed to be new, but they did not hold a charge very long. I will buy from Amazon but not from this individual seller. Rather then return them I just disposed of them (wast of money) and bought new ones from the local battery store (paid more but I got more) and I am very pleased with my new ones."
3,cross country adventure,"As far as I know, the batteries are fine (I ordered them as a gift for my son-in-law), but I'd like to know why they took so long to arrive. I ordered them on Aug. 16, and they didn't get to him until around sept 13, well after his birthday."
4,Rechargable Batt,So far so good. I charge the batteries and so far it hold the charge on the camera. I like this product.
5,Great batteries!!!,We were so tired of throwing away batteries. They definitely don't seem to last like they used to. Then I researched rechargeable batteries and decided on these from other reviews. They are great and last a long time!! Totally worth it!!
5,Best battery for electronics,"Batteries last a long time. I use them in my DSLR camera for shooting HD video and very high resolution pics. Even with flash use, the charge lasts for a loooong time. And most importantly, I can always count on my spare set to be ready for use, since they don't lose the charge that quickly when stored."
1,Not pleased....dead cells after a year,I read the reviews and thought these would be the environmentally friendly way to lesson battery waste. I was wrong. I will look for something else and try again.
3,"Can you say ""all show - no go?""",Don't be fooled. These batteries are no better than average. Take the mandatory Sanyo charger to fit the batteries and it equals LOSE. Get regular NiMh rechargeable batteries and don't waste your money on these.
3,1 out of 16 battieries will no longer charge after 1 year,"I've been using these batteries for about 2 years. I bought 16 batteries and 3 of them were in a flash light that I rarely use. Well I went to use it the other day and of course it was dead. The batteries had been in there probably close to a year. When I went to recharge the batteries only 2 of the 3 would accept a charge. I tested the charger (La Crosse BC 900 Blue) on other batteries I had and it worked fine on those. I think this would have only been the 2nd time I charged these batteries for that matter. The other 15 batteries all work OK. The ""maintain 85% of their charge"" is totally misleading from my experience. Many times I've gone to replace the batteries in my digital thermometer with eneloops that had been sitting around 6 months and the digital read out would be almost as dim as it was with the batteries I had just replaced."
3,"Great Batteries, charger only fair","I have used eneloop batteries for about 2 years and have been quite pleased. When I bought this set, there was no info about the charger, so I hoped it would be a rapid charger. It wasn't. It's the world's slowest trickle charger, which disappointed me. Sanyo needs to supply a better, faster charger."
5,These are GREAT batteries,"The life on these things is amazing :D I just got a digital camera and I've been taking tons and tons and tons of pictures and video with my camera and the battery meter hasn't gone down yet. And this is back-to-back with flash and everything. I have the AAs too and they're just simply awesome. When the batteries die, I just put them on the charger overnight and in the morning, I'm good to go. I don't mind the recharge time since I do all my charging when my stuff isn't gonna be in use."
5,Great product,This is a very good rechargeable battery brand. With one charge I can take from 400 to 500 pictures before I charge it again. Outstanding.
5,Great,I use these for my Wii and 360 controlers. Work great and last forever. Way better then buying batteries all the time
5,The ONLY battery we need!,"My husband and I came across eneloop batteries while shopping at Costco one day. We had been looking for rechargeable batteries after having problems with a few brands we previously purchased. We bought pack with all different sizes. We find ourselves using them daily. In fact, we used them so often that we ordered another set of AA from Amazon. I have them in my digital camera at all times, we have a set charging and use them for everything from the Wii controllers to toddler toys. They're great and have a very long life before needing another charge. Well worth the price."
5,Worth the money,Have purchased cheaper batteries and find that I got what I paid for. Given a choice and a need I'd buy these again. Highly recommend.
5,Good Value,"I suggest using them right out of the package,you will not get very long life out of them the first time,but after the fist charge they perform very well."
5,"Very nice, but they take time to evaluate","well rechargable batteries take time to fully test out, but they havent failed me yet, so 5 stars for me!"
5,Great batteries,I bought a set of cordless phones (3 handsets)and two of the three sets had issues charging and at times the sets would just quit working. I bought these NiMH batteries to replace the ones that came in the phones. From the first charge until now I have had no problems of any sort. In fact the phones are much clearer with batteries that work right. I thought I had bad phones but it was just the batteries that were bad. The price of these batteries was incredible also. I would not hesitate to buy these again if I needed more of this type of battery.
5,Big Fan of Eneloop,"I am a big fan of the Eneloop AA batteries. I am a photographer and use these batteries to power my flashes. I think they are some of the best rechargable batteries available. They hold a charge very well, especially in the first several months of use. They are really put to work by the flash output and I have been very pleased with them. Will definitely continue to use these!"
3,good batteries but disappointing seller,"I returned these batteries to Amazon 2008-01 because they were in a damaged bubble-pack date-stamped 2006-06. They sent me a replacement and it has the same date stamp (and a slightly-dinged pack). Batteries have a limited life, and unlike aged cheese, when I buy ""new"" batteries I expect to get new ones, not aged 18 months. Also, the broken bubble packs hint that these may be from a lot that got dropped or something. If they want to liquidate sub-par merchandise cheap, they should describe it as such. I see no point in sending these back yet again, but will probably buy batteries elsewere in the future."
2,Open Box/Merchandise..,"Please read D-18V's initial review,I must have gotten his returned merchandise! Amazon, how could you not disclosed or advised me that this are not sealed item(s)? I may no longer shop with you guys..."
2,Used Batteries shipped from Amazon?,"Ordered two packs. One pack had been cut open and apparently used. Somehow I thought I ordered a new product, looks like half my order was someone else's used rejects. I am getting the La Crosse charger tomorrow and will see what the deal is with this opened pack of batteries I received. Not very impressed at the moment, buyer beware."
3,Good quality but bad pacakage,My family member recommanded this batter for me. I was kind of surprised when I received this battery because the package is kind bad. It's not complete sealed. But overall the battery is pretty good!!
3,CAUTION: These batteries may not be new,I ordered an 8 pack of these batteries and they came in a plastic baggy with no original manufacturer packaging. I contacted the seller about this and they called it bulk packaging and said that the description of the product indicates this. So far I have found no indication of bulk packaging in the description of this product. They would have been better off to say these batteries have been extensively tested.
1,As Bad as old version NiMH,"I think this kind of Enelxxp battery is only for marketing purpose. I ordered and believed that it can hold the charge as least better than my old NiMH, or per their advertisement said. As other review mentioned, this kind of ""new"" battery cannot hold the charge, it will dis-charge in few days. NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,won't hold a charge,I took a chance and tried these. They are not worth it. I'll never by this brand again.
3,"Make sure of ""AA"" vs. ""AAA""","The batteries seem to be working well. The shipping time was a little longer than I expected and I had searched for ""AA"" NOT ""AAA"". I will take responsibility for he mix up, however I had no need for 2 packs of 4 ""AAA"" batteries. All I can say is double check before you click! Good Luck!"
1,Poor battery life,"This sure beats adding to the landfill by not having to dispose of so many regular batteries but the charge is very shortlived...we get about 20% of what a regular battery gives before the charge gives it out. We initially bought the power pack from costco and ordered extra AAs and AAAs...we could use about 3 more rechargers just to try and stay on top of all the power requirements and recharging that go with the toys, etc. that require batteries."
3,This item may be a counterfeit product.,"When I received this product from BlueProton, a seller of Amazon, I saw a discrepency on the battery and its package. The printing on the battery says 800mAh, and the printing on the package says 2000mAh. The quality looks a little bit low (print is a little bit blur). I used to buy Eneloop batteries from Costco, and I never seen this kind of discrepency.So, yes, it is cheapest you can get, but I doubt it is really the genuine Sanyo Eneloop. Time will tell the truth. Buy at your own risk."
4,Great batteries,"I have at least thirty of these batteries for our kids toys and some of our big kid toys. They work great, hold a charge and last a long time. I threw away all of our other rechargeables. The price for these has gone up from ~$11.00 for 4 AA to almost $20 in the past month !!!??? I'm not sure why for the big price increase."
4,"Amazon, does not always opt for economy of scale.","Just a note:Buy two 4-packs on Amazon for 18USD.Buy one 8-pack on Amazon for 20USD.I have also noticed this anti-economy of scale with the Coolwhip at my local supermarket. Foolishly I previously bought 8-packs of eneloops assuming they were better value, and shall live to regret my mistake.The batteries are good; I shall be replacing my ~60 NiMH cells with these Eneloops. I only give them 4-stars because of the capacity. In time I'm sure it will increase.Lots of love,T.S. Libertan"
3,develops small leaks!,"After 9mos. to a year and maybe 12 charges, using the Sanyo charger, some of these batteries will develop leaks at the negative end where the sealant between the end pieces will ooz a corrosive fluid from inside the battery. Maybe the recharger isn't turning down or off and overcharging the batteries? I don't know. Some don't leak? I'm gonna start timing the charger and stopping after 8 or 10 hours to see if that stops leaks from developing. Other than this the batteries work fine, but if they leak their maximum number of recharges diminishes greatly."
3,power?,Thought these would last longer. I usually take about 600 pictures during a wedding and i was hoping these could make it to 300 I got about 200 out of them first time out of the box if they get better i will up my review.
2,I used the charger 2 times then it died,"I dont write allot of reviews, however I do write reviews more often when things dont work correctly or there is a problem with the product, such as now.I bought this charger and battery combo because I just get tired of constantly buying batteries AFTER the other batteries have died, I had another combo and it took some abuse and lasted about 4 or 5 yrs I guess and finally died. however I bought this charger combo because all the great reviews. I have to say the batteries them selves appear to hold a charge great!, but I only used the charger 2 times and it died. 2 months of use LOL. thats about all I have to say for now, not sure I will buy this brand again."
5,Perform as hoped,"I bought these batteries to replace some older rechargeables which rapidly lost charge. The eneloops worked out of the box and after charging, lasted for a 3 week trip, with about 500 pictures on my camera. Early days but they have been all I hoped for so far.."
2,Dead On the Job,"I do like the fact that I can use the batteries right away without a charge. Unfortunately when used in my flash head, I couldn't get passed 60 shots before I had to change them. The recycling time got considerably longer after the 45 shot. On the average I can take 150 pictures and I'm able to use 1 set of batteries. These just did not last for me. It's even worse when you take rapid shots. You may get the first one but the 2nd and 3rd, no flash. To be fair, if you can wait 10seconds between your shots, these are the batteries. If you need rapid recycling,these will not help"
5,The Diesel of rechargeables,"We use Eneloops for our Pentax digital cameras and flashes. Eneloops work well, they have a lot of torque, to use an engine term - far beyond their 'horsepower' ratings. These last, even when the camera starts to indicate low power, if you turn the camera off for a bit, the batteries come back showing full power. Eneloops hold their charge for longer than ordinary rechargeables. I've had the original set for 5 years before one of the batteries went bad. I recommend these highly, they seem to be more consistent than other brands."
5,eneloop batteries,This is the greatest idea.....pre-charged batteries! So handy to just pop in camera and have them work immediatly.
5,Want to say more-- but it's needless- these are the best!!,I don't give a lot of five stars. But here's one. They come charged as advertised and last for a long long time without recharging-- a welcome when you want to quickly pull out your camera that has been sitting around for weeks to get that great shot.
5,Sanyo Eneloop Batterys,"Personally I think that the Sanyo Eneloop Batterys are the best that they have came up with, They must have realized that because they are getting hard to find unless you can find them on the internet.I couldn't find any in the town that I live in.They are well worth the extra few Dollars. I took over 300 pictures on a single charge. I give them a number 10, 10 as being the highest."
5,Never known a better battery!,I purchased these batteries and charger based on reviews. Reviews are so true! I don't think I ever ran out of battery power using my 8mp camera on fine settings. They are totally charged up out of the box and last forever! I bought 8 additional batteries thinking since I take alot of pictures I needed them. Not true as they seem to last forever and charge fast! I really only need one back up set (My camera takes 4)This by far is a BEST purchase for camera use. The charger is easy to use.
5,Lasts Long - really long,Got this product from Amazon and have not charged the batteries even once Yet.Of the four batteries which came along with the charger 2 batteries have lasted entire Las Vegas/Grand Canyon trip for 3 days without having to charge them. The batteries came precharged and have been able to use them so long on my Canon S10.Would definitely recommend this product
3,Not Bad.,"I have only used this for about a week. It seems convenient and priced right, but, initially, the batteries do not seem to last a long time on a full charge. It may get better."
3,"Holds charge well, but cheap white plastic around battery is fragile","These cells seem to hold their charge much better than previous NiMh cells, but be careful not to damage the fragile white plastic shrink-wrap that encases each cell. I scraped a bit of plastic off of one cell while inserting it into the battery charger, and it made some sparks because a bit of the negative terminal is now exposed on the positive side of the battery. When this happens, you can do what I did and wrap some electrical tape over the positive end of the cell and it'll be a bit safer but look like cr*p."
5,Long lasting chargeable batteries,I haven`t bought any new AAA batteries since I started using these batteries about 2 years ago. I found that they work in all my uses for AAA batteries. When charged they last a year or longer. I always can count on ready batteries.
5,Sanyo Eneloop NiMH Batteries w/ Charger,"The batteries work well with my k-x, but the charging time is pretty long. I used the charger in the pack (made in China) to charge the four batteries (made in Japan) for the first time last night, it took more than 6 hours to complete! (10 hours stated in the manual). The two light kept flashing when charging, so if you need to charge the batteries overnight, don't plug in your bedroom!Update:After first time charging, the batteries last 785 shots + some video recording, still some left, but I just don't want to take any chance. That's amazing!"
5,Great product!,"Everything is great, except it takes several hours to charge. Also, with my charger, I can only charge even numbers at a time. However, considering it remains charged for a long, long time, it's worth it. These are very reliable batteries. I would recommend to keep several on hand to keep up with all the household use. Another tip, to remind myself whereabouts of the batteries, I keep an index card(e.g. 1 AA - dining clock, 3 AAA - toy laptop) with the bag of my eneloops"
4,Must buy for SX130 IS,This is a an excellent buy if you have a Canon SX130 IS . The above battery lasts very long.
5,These are the ones to get,"I have used numerous other brands of Rechargeable batteries(monster,sony,..). None are even close to these on holding their charge over time and out of the box. Yes, they seem to be more expensive at first, but not if you actually count their useful life in the equation(actually they are cheaper). To get their full life you need to pair these up with a lacrosse charger."
4,Yay! better batteries!,"Having a USB charger is nice. Having batteries which last longer, can be recharged more and can be recharged halfway thru their charge w/o loosing max charge is VERY NICE!"
4,The Good and the Bad,"I want to thank CONTINENTAL SUPPLY for the speedy delivery. They said it would take up to 3 weeks to get my batteries, they arrived in 4 days. The batteries appear to be fully charged, again, thank-you. That was the good, now for the bad. The package I received contained an OEM-looking brown cardboard box with 4 batteries in it. No seals, no dates, no nothing! No way to tell if they are brand new, used, abused, etc. I would have felt differently if the web site had said they are OEM and I had purchased them with that knowledge but it didn't and I don't. Very disappointed in Amazon and CONTINENTAL SUPPLY for the misleading advertising. My experience with Amazon has generally been good until today.UPDATE 01-29-2013: The batteries are still performing as they are supposed to, no problems on that front."
2,Beware,"Beware of output voltage. These and most other rechargable batteries have a stated output voltage of 1.2 VDc as opposed to the ""normal"" 1.5 Vdc from typical alkaline AA batteries. My flash flight is not quite as bright.The 1.2 VDc was in the battery specs on the WEB, I just did not notice it."
2,Cheap packaging! Order elsewhere.,"Ordered these a while ago, finally got round to opening the package. Each battery has a small crimp/crack at the base, exposing the internals.Packaging was just a thin plastic envelope. Too late to return now, but won't be buying from here again."
4,Great way to go for batteries,"I have used these for sometime now, and they are great. They cover all the common sizes, and they last as long as a conventional battery, only these you charge back up and your good to go."
5,These are the best,"We go through a lot of batteries with our tv remotes and game controllers. I got tired of disposing of alkaline batteries and switched to these based on the reviews. They really are the best batteries, we have saved a ton of money using these instead of alkaline, and I feel better knowing that I'm not putting toxic waste back into the sanitation system. They charge quickly and last a long time."
5,Great long-lasting batteries,These batteries can be kept in the drawer and they will keep charge for a very long time (unlike standard accumulator batteries).It is convenient for me to have spare charged batteries for my wireless keyboard -- don't have to wait until batteries charge when I need to swap them.
4,"So far, so good!...","These batteries seem to work OK, ...however, they have only been through a couple of charge cycles since I purchased them for backup to my digital SLR. Time will tell, but sO far I am pleased."
4,Just what I was looking for.,"If one must use batteries, this is exactly what I was looking for. They are more environmentally safe than most batteries and easy to use for Mouse, Camera etc. So far they are holding up well. I hope they will recharge and last for many years."
5,Great batteries,"Great batteries, I already own two sets of four. I bought these last sets for my dad for father's day. The only other batteries that I have seen that are comparable are the ones that came with my charger (a great charger to go with these batteries). http://www.amazon.com/Crosse-Technology-BC-9009-AlphaPower-Battery/dp/B00077AA5Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1247417327&sr=8-1"
5,Good rechargeables,"The Sanyo Eneloop batteries hold the voltage much better than most NiMH batteries I've used, including the special Energizer batteries that supposedly do the same. I have a digital camera is particularly fussy over what it uses and it has performed flawlessly and for a longer period of time with these batteries. Worth the money. Get a good charger with them and you are set."
4,Good,I'm a freelance photographer and I currently have 12 of these batteries and they are very reliable for my camera strobes.
5,Best Nimh batteries,"After wasting many $$ on Energizer 2500mah nimh batteries, i was amazed by the performance of the Eneloop AA batteries. The energizer ones would lose their charge in less than 5 days, and the Sanyo ones take 287 pictures for more than 2 weeks. This is on my Canon S1IS camera. Great product!"
4,Not suitable for world traveling,I love the batteries that they retain their charge at least as well as lithium-ion batteries. It also has no memory. But beware that the charger that comes with them only works with 120V will be fried in 220V countries.
3,sad face,Bought these for my wireless keyboard and i pop them and.....nothing they dont work in it. they work in everything else. was pretty disappointed when they didnt work for the thing i bought them for. oh well the AAs work in my mouse good battery life.
5,eneloop batteries,"These batteries are great, ready to use right out of the package and they do hold more of a charge over time when compared to the regular Nimh batteries (based on my informal observations). Delivery was prompt."
5,These batteries work GREAT!,"Compared to the old AA rechargable batteries that I was using in my digital camera, these seem to last about eight times longer (guesstimate) before losing their charge. I bought a second set and they are the ONLY batteries I will buy from now on!"
5,Fantastic battery,"Purchased these, primarily, for a external camera flash. I am amazed by these batteries life (I have yet to charge them since purchasing).The set of four have fired a reasonably powerful set of strobes over 200 times and they still recharge the capacitor in the strobe very quickly (indicating they are still strongly charged).I highly recommend these batteries."
5,Best rechargeable batteries I've used.,"I reviewed the AAA size of these recently as well. Others have done extensive testing on the batteries and demonstrated their quality. I'll simply add that the batteries were fully charged out of the package and got me through 4-5 SD cards in one of my cameras before needing a recharge. The consensus is that these will last past 1,000 cycles, and at this point, I see no reason to doubt that."
3,I DON'T GET THE HYPE!,"I have never reviewed a product on Amazon before but had to give my opinion here.I tried these out in a Princeton Tec Corona headlamp that I use at work often, thinking they would be the best battery I have ever owned. To my surprise, my store bought Energizer Rechargeables absolutely DESTROY these Sanyos hands down, every time. The Sanyos die out very quickly. Maybe they work better in different applications, or maybe I got a box of defects but the results don't lie. Back to the Energizers!"
4,Eneloop batteries,"I bought these recharger and batteries because, using a flash, I could literally only take about 20 pictures with two AA batteries before they were dead and in need of replacement. With the Eneloop batteries I can take 60-80 pictures before I have to switch batteries. Much better!"
5,Best batteries of any rechargeable that I have used.,"My charger reads each cell to tell charge state and voltage when they are inserted. All of the cells come out very close to each other out of the package. That means they will last longer because one cell won't die before the other. When that happens the dead cell gets charged backwards as you use the device they are installed in. That means more to me than a slightly higher capacity, and the proof that it works is that the batteries last much longer than regular ni-mh batteries, no matter the rating."
5,"Cheap if you consider they'll last for a long, long time",These batteries have great durability. I used them to power my Nikon flash (SB600) and I got very consistent results with 1-2 seconds reload time. Great stuff! Highly recommended if you're into photography.
1,1/8 DOA,"Of the eight batteries in the pack I bought, 1 of them was DOA. Sanyo's poor warranty makes it more trouble to return it than it's worth."
5,rechargeables have come of age,THese seem to be good capacity rechargeables. Now I just have to make sure I don't dispose of any along with the device it powered...
3,Rechargeable batteries,Please dont rush me - these are rechargeable batteries ... I have hardly had a chance to use them. On a preliminary basis though I would say that I like the charger - it doesn't block the other outlet on a wall outlet and the batteries were charged and ready to go out of the box. I purchased this product based on the info that they can be charged 2x more than most others and because they allegedly hold a higher charge for a longer time period. Obviously time will tell ..... Thats all folks.
2,Disappointed with Eneloop Batteries,"After reading the reviews I thought this would be the perfect rechargeable battery for my camera. I was wrong. They do not hold a charge longer than a day, if that. Also it takes longer to take a picture using these batteries than other rechargeable. I made 2 phone calls to the company asking if they have a return or exchange policy. They have not returned my phone call."
1,Worthless,"I've owned the Eneloop for less than 3 months and they won't even take a charge. It's too late to send it back so I guess I'm stuck with it. $18 down the drain, I guess..."
1,Disappointed,I purchased these batteries with the charger hoping that they can retain charge longer than ordinary rechargeable batteries. But I was disappointed because some days after a recharge these batteries completely lose their charge and don't work at all-I have to charge again for many hours to use them again.
2,Didn't work,"It said pre-charged but they wern't. Had to plug it in and leave for a while. Didn't use in the product I intended to use with for some reason, so it was pretty much a waste of time and money all around."
5,The Only Rechargables that work with my Flash,I will only buy these rechargeables from now on. They are the only ones powerful enough for my Canon 580 flash.
1,JUNK,"I believed the hype that eneloop batteries are better than the sliced bread. So I bought 8 AA and 4 AAA to test. I also bought theLa Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery Chargerin the same order (great charger).I put 6 AA eneloop batteries in a remote control for a small helicopter toy (Air Hogs Havoc Heli - Colors May Vary). They lasted about 7 days with minimal usage (I assume the remote transmits even if not playing).The sad part, when I put them to recharge, they were DEAD, as in no current would run through the damn batteries. See images attached to the product. I placed a cheaper SONY battery that would charge, but not the fancy eneloops.Sorry Amazon, but I have to send your junk back."
1,amazon isn't posting all that you need to know!,"nowhere in the description does it mention the mA rating of these batteries. i bought them thinking i was going to receive the most current sanyo offering. to my sad surprise i ened up with the older 800mA version.my research indicated that sanyo makes the very best AAA rechargeable battery today. just be sure to get the newer 1000mA version, not these."
1,"I wanted AA, not AAA","I'm not sure if I messed up, or not. I wanted to order AA batteries and ended up with AAA. I guess I can eventually use them in a remote or something."
5,Great Battery for my Canon Flash,"SANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable BatteriesThese Pre-Charged batteried do not discharge when left in my canon flash, even for months. They are always ready to go when I need them. I only have to recharge them when I take a lot of flash pictures.I used other brands of NIHM batteries, but none hold up like the SANYO Pre-Charged batteries. I love them.Duncan"
5,Love these!,"These are the best rechargeable batteries I've found. They hold their charge for longer than any other I've used, and they charge quicker, too."
3,The Jury is still out.,So far so good. These batteries take and hold a charge better than regular NiMh batteries. Need more time to evaluate them.
5,good batteries. plain white label makes them easy to not throw away.,"some of the other brands of rechargeables (energizer, duracell, etc) have inadvertently gotten thrown away around here because despite being labeled 'rechargeable' the brand-labeling makes them look like their alkaline disposable cousins that weve thrown away (recycled actually) for so long.these stand out and everyone knows they go back in the charger.they seem to hold the charge they claim overall. most of them test at about 1800mAh when i first get them (who knows how long they sit in the warehouse) but after charging and testing they hold a little bit over the advertised 2000mAh."
4,eneloop 8-pack AA bateries,I am impressed with the batteries. They are holding charge longer than I thought. In fact I will be reordering soon.
4,A rechargeable battery you can keep for later,"I've been using rechargeable batteries for years and when I heard about the Eneloop, it seemed too good to be true. Although the claims are a bit exagerrated, it does live up to its promise.This is the only rechargeable battery you can keep aside as spare and know that it will work when you need it.I had a $50 Fuji 5MP camera that I almost threw away because it just sucked up my rechargeable batteries. When I got the Eneloop, the camera had a second life. Now all I have is a pair of Eneloops loaded and another pair spare.My only problem now is what to do with 10's of older rechargeable batteries that I have. After trying out the Eneloop, conventional rechargeable batteries have no use for me anymore.I still think there's a lot of room for improvement so I give it a 4-star rating. Otherwise, nothing else is better (there's the Rayovac Hybrid but I'm in Asia and we don't have that here)."
4,Perfectly fine so far,"I use my eneloops to power flashlights regularly, they last way longer than regular ones, and seem to get the 'high' setting for longer on my flashlight. On my camera flash, they work for about three times asana flashes as standard alkalines, this is where these babies shine! The increased amperage also cuts down recycle time between flashes. They work great for me so far, the only reason no 5 stars, these things are DAMN expensive, and I want a bigger charger!"
3,Failure rate of about 20 percent over a one year period,"I charge these usingLa Crosse Technology BC-700 Alpha Power Battery Chargerso I'm able to see on a battery-specific basis which ones are charging slowly or not at all. Over a period of about a year, about 1 out of 5 of these batteries completely stop charging."
4,Great Independent channel charger,"Much better than the paired charger that is coming with most eneloop packs now, smart charging for single cells means no worries."
1,Didn't work as promised,The first 2 I used only held a charge for about 2 months in my Kodak camera and they didn't get re-charged when I put my camera on the dock. Then I switched them to my toothbrush and they worked really good for a while. Then they stopped working. Bummer.
2,Overrated,"They might last ""a long time"" but their capacity is like 1400 mAH-seems like they have to be recharged constantly in even medium drain enviornments so they actually reach their charge/discharge cycle life rather quickly.....Next time I'll just buy Japanese manufactured Duracell 2450's at Kroger when they're on sale @ $9.99....."
5,Excellent Rechargeables for rarely used items,"These will keep charge when not in used unlike some others that will continue to drain while idle. I got some AAs for my WiiFi and WiiRemotes and some AAAs for some other remotes. Before when I used the Energizer rechargeables, the WiiFit would always be out of batteries when I wanted to use it but now, I do not have that problem. These are not the only batteries that keep charge on the market but I have good experience with them so I will stay with Sanyo."
5,Love these,"I'm not a battery expert, but I bought this one year ago, the batteries have been used continuously since then -- mostly in wireless XBOX 360 controllers -- and they are still going strong. I like them so much that I subsequently ordered more AA batteries for GPS, flashlights, computer mice, TV controllers, etc., as well as AAA batteries. The charger doesn't seem like the sturdiest piece of equipment but it has given me no trouble whatsoever."
3,Quick Discharge!,"We have had 12 of the AA and AAA Eneloops for over 6 months now. We use them in digital camera, mouse, clocks, remotes, etc... They have to be recharged way too often! I'd say they last 60-75% of what they should or a normal battery would.I am trying the Everyready rechargeables now, but I just read that the Sony rechargeables work great too!"
4,Sanyo Eneloop NiMH rechargeable batteries,"I like that these batteries come pre-charged. After they are drained they recharge quickly. They are reliable, and work very well in my digital camera."
5,Great batteries!,This the first set of rechargeable batteries that I have ever owned so I can't compare to others. They do hold their charge and seem to last an incredibly long time.
4,Batteries,I bought these to replace my other rechargeable batteries that I had been using for my camera. They worked right out of the package. I have taken only about 60 shots with them and so far I haven't had to recharge them.
5,Excellent Precharged AA NiMH batteries,"I bought this 4-pk AA Eneloop batteries, and so far they beat my Energizer 2500mah AA NiMH batteries. I have had so many Energizer AA NiMH batteries die, after sitting charged on a shelf. I use the LA CROSSE BC-900 battery charger for these batteries. I recommend these batteries for any AA battery use. These Eneloop batteries will hold up to 85 percent of there charge in one year, as long as they are kept in the fridge at the same temperature, milk is kept at. Wished I had a moisture-proof container for keeping the AA's in the fridge."
5,Really good batteries!,"These batteries made my Canon SX100 camera much happier. They hold their charge much longer than the Lenmar batteries they replace. A good deal, so good that I bought a second set of 4."
5,Best Ni-MH batteries available today,These rechargeable batteries are the best ones out there for high-drain devices such as digital cameras and remote control cars. I highly recommend them to anyone. They come fully charged from the factory and recharge quickly with plenty of power.
5,eneloop is amazing!,"Sounds weird, but eneloop is an amazing battery.....it ran forever in my MP3 player! The other night I feel asleep listening to my MP3 player, woke up the next morning went to work and when I got home, went to bed later that night and the MP3 player was STILL RUNNING! go eneloop!"
5,Best made rechargeable batteries I have seen thanks NLee,"These eneloop are really made solid not as most I have used which are cheaply made. I really can't say how good they are I just got them but, the package say I can take 500 pictures on one charge.It pass my test so far took 15-20 pictures and the battery is still fully charge. The RadioShack and the Tenergy ones died after 10-15 pictures. I will be happy with 50-100 pictures but, if I do get over 100 and even 500 per charge I will never buy any other brand."
5,Eneloop = quality,"I ordered a pack of Eneloop AA batteries and a pack of regular Sanyo AAA batteries at the same time a while back. Hands down, Eneloop was better in every possible way. Recommended."
5,Eneloop batteries are my choice,"Used many different brands such as Energizer, Rayovac, Canon etc for snapshot and SLR digital cameras. Sanyo batteries provide most reliable service in spite of slightly lower claimed capacity of 2000 mAh vs 2500mAh for many other brands."
5,you get what you pay for,Buy these and be happy with lots of long-lasting battery power when you need it. Simple as that. Those other cheapo brands will just frustrate you.
5,Best of the best,This is the best battery product I have got for using it in my photo camera. It last long (very long) and takes lots of pics.
5,Eneloop Batteries + Charger...,I received exactly what I thought I would. The Eneloop batts were partially charged when I got them...I fully charged before using. The application was a pair of Nikon flash units. I tested the recharge time after a full power flash and the Eneloops time was about 60% of the Lithium primary cells I had been using. That's what I wanted. I also measured the temperature rise of both type batts and the Eneloop was much cooler. The only negative is that the Eneloops are quite a bit heavier than the Lithiums.The charger was a basic unit. It works. The power pins (that plug in the wall) fold up into the unit so it stores nicely.
4,good battery,"I own the battery for years. It is still working, no noticeable degeneration.I wish the capacity would be larger."
5,Awesome Batteries,"I have been using eneloop batteries for years and think they are the greatest batteries ever! As a matter of fact, the ones that I purchased about 3 years ago still work great and hold a long charge. I haven't had to dispose of ANY of those yet and we use a LOT of batteries in our house for all our video game remotes, digital camera, remotes, etc. I decided to buy more to replace any and every other remaining old battery in our house. I would highly recommend these to anyone. They are also great for the environment in the sense that you won't be tossing batteries regularly."
5,Good Stuff.,"These batteries are really high-quality, look sexy, last a long time, and work well. You get what you pay for, and Sanyo is one of the best rechargable brands!"
4,property manager,The batteries appear to function as advertised and held a good charge for seven hours of use in walkie talkies. I recommend these batteries.
5,wish they had these a long time ago,"I bought these and the la crosee charger after our camera was dead every time with traditional nimh batteries. I put these in the Wii remotes and our canon powershot camera. no problems and I have not had to charge them yet. Although the capcity is rated a bit lower than regular nimh batteries, these will not self-discharge hardly at all so you will have more capacity when you go to use a camera or remote. I will never buy another regular nimh. I'll only buy LSD precharged batteries like these."
2,the charger is not for travellers,"I was very dissapointed from this product, because it was written, that it is worldwide voltage, but whn it came I saw that it is usable only in US (120) and I wanted it for use in Europe, so I had to return it."
1,Do not use with metal enclosure,The first time I used these batteries they shorted out and burned my hand. The fault is that the wrapper does not wrap around the negative connector leaving about 1/16 of a inch of metal exposed. If used with a battery enclosure that is metal it could short out like mine did. The AA batteries are not made this way only the AAA. Do NOT buy until they have changed this. I was lucky enough to have caught before they exploded and only burned my hand.
5,Awesome batteries!,"I switched to these, and use them for my 360 controllers, remotes, G700 mouse, and many other things. I have probably 20 of them, and they work great, and hold charges well. I used some Duracell rechargables, and they were bad in remotes because after 30-60 days I need to charge them again. I put these in my remotes, and they last forever 6+ months. They only provide 1.2v and I dont know what that could mean for devices that are meant to run on 1.5v Alkaline batteries. So far tho I havent had any issues."
4,Very Good,"Haven't ran out of juice yet. Good quality (it seems) charger. For the price, having a world voltage charger is very good. I use a Pentax K-x and its very convenient."
5,Best Rechargeable Option,"These batteries hold their charge after recharging, far better than average NiMh batteries. Be sure to only use the eneloop charger, or, you'll ruin them."
5,Eneloop Batteries,"Great batteries. I use these in my kids RC toys and also in my Canon digital camera. In my opinion, these batteries are the best on the market that I've tried. I read the reviews here on Amazon before I bought the charging pack bundle and then followed up about three months later by buying this 4 pack of AA batteries. I highly recommend these to anyone that is looking for a great rechargeable battery."
4,Eneloop AA rechargeable batteries,"Used these batteries for the first time while on a vacation, in a Canon Power Shot A510 camera. I was very pleased with the life of the batteries, I managed to take 235 pictures over 11 days with the first pair, then 237 pictures over 8 days with the second. After recharging took 240 pictures over 5 days, this is much better than I have experienced with other NiMH rechargeable batteries. Pictures were mainly daytime, but some nightime shots with flash also. Do not yet know how long they hold their charge whithout use, but am hoping for a good life span.12/11/11 Update, batteries have a great shelf life have left them in the camera for as long as 3 months and they still work. Again I recommed these rechargeable batteries for excellent performance."
3,Not very satisfied,These are not very good charge holding batteries -they are just ok - they lose charge very soon and take time to get recharged - i dont say they are bad ( i have had worse experiences with rechargeables ) - but if u tend to use them a lot then go for a better one
5,Holds a charge well!,"I highly recommend these rechargeable batteries as being durable, quick to charge and to hold a charge even when using high drain gizmos like digital cameras. The prices here at Amazon are great, but even if they were priced higher these batteries would still be a bargain due to their high quality.I have used both the AA and AAA sizes and will be purchasing more of both."
5,Got these for Pentax K-X,I got these for my Pentax K-XBest PurchaseI even got my friend to send me the updated eneloop from japan with the charger(TGR03) with 1500 times recycle life.You will not regret the purchaseI Refreshed them with my Japanese eneloop charger (No need to get an expensive charger for these)and work almost like normal AA batteriesYou will not regret the purchase
5,Stop Buying Alkalines!,"I've tried several brands of rechargeable NiMHs. These are as good as any. When you're buying, regardless of the brand, get hybrid types, such as these. If they are not hybrids, they will self-discharge rather quickly. The hybrid types hold their charge."
5,Great!,"I bought these batteries for my digital camera because I was tired of only getting about half a day of pictures out of my alkaline batteries. These are great! So far we have used our camera for 3 long days of pictures and not had to recharge them at all! Now I just hope they hold up to their reputation of withstanding lots of recharges -- unlike our last set of ""rechargeable batteries""...."
5,Best Rechargeables out there...,I now own 20AAs of Eneloops. They last forever and best of all... they hold their charge FOREVER when not in use. A lot of times I forget to charge them before I go on a shoot but I'm never concerned that I'll drain them dead or have dead batteries when I reach in my bag to find a spare pair. They are a little expensive but worth every penny.
4,Excellent Rechargable Batteries,I use these continuously for my Wii remotes and other products around the house and they have worked flawlessly. I see more and more positive reviews for these online and am very happy with my purchase. I highly recommend this charger to compliment these outstanding batteries:La Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery Charger
4,Great for digital camera,"Great batteries for digital camera. Have had 2AA in my camera for a month,taken over 100 pics and several video clips and haven't had to change them yet. The camera sucked the life out of regular AA's. So far great buy. Just only had them 1 month."
4,Works right out of the box,These batteries worked right away without charging.I haven't really tested their charge holding ability over a long time.As for rechargable batteries they are as good as any.
5,Excellent for Photo gear,These are great batteries for the photographer! Good recycle time in my speedlight and other gear.
5,The Best You Can Get!,These are the ONLY batteries my family uses! I bought the starter kit at Costco 3 years ago and after endless recharging they are still going strong!!! These batteries are especially good for our Wii system and controllers! My husband and I researched online and discovered that using a charging station for your remotes actually VOIDS your nintendo warrenty!!! Nintendo recommeds using rechargeable batteries such as these! LOVE them! GET them!
4,It works. Don't know what to complain.,"For some reason, the batteries need to be recharged partially for the first few uses. After a few times of partially charged, they can be fully recharged. That seems odd but the batteries work."
5,Good rechargeable batteries that last (when left idle),"I did not do specific tests (unlike others), but comparing these with other non-Sanyo rechargeable batteries I owned before, these do last longer (without need to recharge) when left idle.I have also thrown away some of my old rechargeable batteries even though I have not cycled through 500 charges! So far, these Sanyo batteries have lasted a while - so think they are pretty reliable.Love these! Ended buying AAA as well (for my cordless phone)."
5,Holding Charge As Described!,"I rarely use my camera but when I need it ""in action"", the camera turns on without any issues! In the past I had regular NiMH that it will slowly drain and when I need to use my camera, it always give ""low battery"" warning. Now NO MORE!!"
4,Excellent batteries with good charger,"Have had good experience with Sanyo enelope rechargeables, and decided to get this to use in my Pentax DSLR as these were the most recommended of rechargeables for the camera. The batteries hold the charge well, and the new charger is a welcome improvement to my 3+ year old Panasonic charger. The new charger is able to charge two batteries as seperate set, compared to my current charger which charges all four as one. There is a more slimmer model charger made by Sanyo which is capable of charging each battery independently but the charger only works with 110V which does not make it a great travel charger, which is why I opted for this charger as universal compability in voltage was important to me. Note though the charger is not a quick charger, and takes a few hours to charge a set of batteries."
1,"Good batteries, packaging damaged and opened","When I buy NEW products, I do not expect them to arrive in damaged packaging. One battery in the package had been flipped end-to-end, an orientation one never see's in undamaged battery packs. The packaging I am referring to is the Sanyo card package by the way. This package had been opened, was edge-damaged, and had been re-packed. One of the eight batteries had broken out of the package into the containing box. Amazon warehouse staff should not hand-repack loose contents into damaged original manufacturer's packaging to be sold as a new product. That's bad business."
1,not so good.,"I purchased this item in Amazon and received it in a open-box status. Load it to my flash light, does not work, charge it for one night, still the same. I use Energy rechargable battery, does work with my flash light. need to return it."
1,DOES NOT WORK!,"This charger does not work. I plugged it into three electrical outlets to be sure. The light does not go on as it should. I am going to have to go through the inconvenience of contacting Sanyo's customer service, an adventure that I can do without. If I'm lucky, they might replace it after I send the defective one back to them. All of this wastes time that I don't have to spare."
1,Sorry I ever bought them,My son had researched them so I bought them but they barely last 2 weeks in our TV controlers or in our wireless mouse for our computer. I would NEVER buy them again and wish I could return them and get my money back.
1,"120V only, not worldwide power","The charger shown is the 100-120V version, not the 100-240V version. It is NOT worldwide power. I made this mistake on another Eneloop combo and discovered it too late to return. Amazon ignored my complaint about the description of this product. The batteries are terrific; buy them separately."
5,They sent me the wrong product!!!!,"I ordered and paid for ""AA"" Eneloop batteries. Amazon sent me ""AAA"" batteries by mistake. I sent them back and was promptly refunded on my credit card. Amazon was very fast in redunding my money."
1,Batteries are dead after 6 months use,"Left 4 Sanyo Eneloop batteries in my Nikon SB600 flash for 6 months, based on excellent reviews and ads of ""keeping charge"". 3 out of 4 batteries are now totally ""dead"", are showing ""null"" when inserted in La Crosse charger!I have also way cheaper CTA 2700mA batteries, they are keeping charge for over 1 year already and NONE of 8 similar batteries is dead"
1,nothing special,I have not found these to be any better than other rechargables after 6 months of use. These are overrated.
1,"Worthless, just fraudulent","This product is worthless. I trusted what Sanyo claims the product is and went on vacation to Africa with the eneloop batteries only. I had 6 pairs of these fully charged batteries with me, thinking that even a pair is enough for the number of photos I was planning to take (400-500) with my Olympus SP-350 digital camera. The first pair didn't even last for 10 photos. I then replaced with the second pair of batteries, resulting with the same number of photos. Unfortunately, I didn't even have the charger with me. I ended up buying new batteries in Africa, which by the way worked much better than these eneloop batteries I brought with from the USA. I cannot even return the product and get my money back because I lost two of the batteries. I'm furious, it's just fraudulent.Sanyo Eneloop AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries with USB Charger (2 Pack)[[ASIN:B00198BF9W Sanyo Eneloop Power Pack with Battery Charger, 8 AA]"
1,"NOT WORLDWIDE POWER, 100-120V only","Would not buy this product again. If you have any problem with a sanyo product, you will NEVER get service from this company. After 2 weeks of sending meails and several hours of calling every Sanyo customer service number I could find online, I just gave up. You will only get voice-prompts, circular loops, and deaed-end messages. DON'T BUY SANYO"
1,false advertsing,I bought these Rechargeable Batteries 1 month ago and I have never received them. Customer Service sent me some bull s... that they run out of them. As you can see a month later they still are advertise here. What a bed business!!!
2,gps batteries,at first they seemed to be ok in my gps...colorado ....but the last couple of times the batterys wouldn't last two hours...I am really disappointed in the batterys and if you want them for a gps I would not recomemend it..
2,Will Do In A Pinch,"I have not had the best of luck with rechargeable batteries... same goes for these eneloop recharables as well. They just don't seem to hold a charge. I am using them in me Skype portable phone, as the phone's charger no longer works.It seems I have to swap out these batteries every 24-48 hours, even when I've had the phone turned off. If I keep the phone just on standby, without talking on it, I definitely have to swap out these chargables at least twice a day.But having said all that, if you need a triple A battery in the middle of the night and the nearest store is a ways away, if you keep a pair or all four charged up and ready when you need them... As the title of this review says, the will do in a pinch."
2,No better than others,"These batteries are no better than any other rechargeable batteries. After reading professional reviews, I had high hopes that these batteries would hold their charge better than all the others. Unfortunately, this is not the case. I guess my search continues."
1,Defective,One of the four batteries I received is defective and will not hold a charge. The others seem to work ok.
2,Not enough power for all applications,Bought some of these cells for my Mac wireless mouse and wireless keyboard. They will hold enough charge for a couple hours before the mouse or keyboard stops working. Same for an XBox controller. I was pretty disappointed by it. Tried it with two different chargers and still they are basically useless as batteries.
5,Great long lasting battery,"Sanyo eneloop is a great rechargeable battery. It is pre-charged so you can use it right away. I have another pair of sanyo eneloop battery and it lasted over a year. The discharge rate of this battery is really low. If you are looking for rechargeable batteries, this is the one to get."
3,Plausible but not convincing,"The two authors, reporters for the Buffalo News, did an admirable job at fillingin the background of McVeigh but fail to address two central issues. They appear to accept at face value McVeigh's claim to have done it all himself. However the finances of the bombing do not hold up to scrutiny. McVeigh traveled widely without any visible means of support. The authors claim the money gained in the robbery of a gun dealer did not go to him. If so, where did the money come from to finance this operation? For clues to that, see Stephen Jones' book, ""Others Unknown"".The other crucial issue which they do not address, is how a single fertilizer bomb do so much damage to a modern concrete, steel reinforced building? Why are there two blasts which show on the siesmograph within seconds that morning? Again, the authors do not address that. That McVeigh was in on it, cannot be disputed. But there's a ""rest of the story"" here. Maybe we will learn it after we learn who killed JFK..."
5,"There but for fortune, go you or I","Best organized book on the fortune and misfortune insights and lives of Timothy McVeigh. How and where he met his now infamous friends. How plans were formed.Some of the details are a little freaky as I come from a different era yet I read many of the same books and watched the same movies. Even had many similar experiences in the army even though it was a different MOS and locations. I was in armed recon.The book is well written by Lou Michel and Dan Herbeck, staff reporters for the Buffalo News. I could tell occasionally that the writers were writing about things that they did not experience themselves.This one book should not be overlooked if you want to be culturally literate."
3,"Sooooo cute, wanted to love it but measurements ARE inaccurate","I read reviews before I bought this, but I wanted to believe that the people were wrong who said the measurements were inaccurate because of the ribbon. They were right. The ribbon adds at least an extra 1/2"". I think I will either sew it or tape it so it is right. If you butt the panels right up next to eachother the measurement is exactly right. Otherwise this is a wonderful growth chart. I think it is very well made and beautiful. It is NOT a toy, so it is not made for your child to play with - definitely not sturdy enough for that. I am disappointed about the measurement problem, but not enough to send it back. It is too pretty and too easy to fix. I hope they are still around for my next child!"
4,Great addition to our garden themed decor.,"I bought the growth chart because it matched the garden decor for our first daughter's room. The growth chart's measurements were not accurate, but we loved it. I'm purchasing another one for my second daughter."
5,Annihilates Redeemer Myths,"One can still hear the refrain that ""slavery had no bearing on the Civil War; the war was fought over state's rights."" Drew refutes that comforting delusion better than anyone I have seen. This book uses the words and actions of Southern leaders to convict them of treason. Drew's succinct, plain, and professional scholarship will leave readers convinced of the centrality of secessionists' actions in defense of ever-expanding slaveholder rights to the origins of the Civil War. A great, depressing book."
3,"Of course slavery, but......","I agree that this book affords us a valuable glimpse into a hitherto little-known area of Southern history, but it hardly provides us with an explanation of the Civil War. No one in his right mind would deny that the arguments over the right to secede were connected with the peculiar institution of slavery. The southern states did not secede merely as a class exercise in US Constitution 101. The question remains, no matter what the motivating factor to secede, is it permitted under the Constitution? Principled argument in the affirmative was made and continues to be made. The argument against the book's thesis is surely the reasons why the Administration opposed the South's effort to secede: not that slavery had to be abolished and all men and women live equally under the law....but that the South hadn't the right to break away."
5,What I never knew about the Civil War,I purchased this book for a Civil War reconstruction university class and was amazed at the information which I never knew about the start of the War.This is a very interesting book and a very easy read. I had to read the whole thing for class and I found it very hard to put down.I highly recommend it to anyone taking a class about the Civil War or just interested in Civil War history.
1,a trained monkey could play this!,"My friends insisted that I buy this CD without listening to it - or any Charlie Hunter - beforehand. My ex-friends, I mean...."
3,Good...but lacking,"This collection was well researched and well made. The actors portraying the major players of the Revolution were very believable. The set is what it is; a great to start scratching your Revolutionary itch. However, it is glaringly lacking in some areas. For one, the complete brushing over of the entire Philadelphia Campaign. The only battle that even received mention was Brandywine. The rest of the action around Philadelphia went unmentioned, including the infamous winter at Valley Forge. The war in the South could have been more thoroughly addressed, also. Much like the History Channels ""American Revolution"" these video collections are entertaining and provide some fillers and portraits of human interest but the true Revolutionary enthusiast will come away disappointed. Keep your noses in the books for indepth treatment of this time period."
4,Great series - Lame DVD,"What a pity PBS chose to turn out a truly lousy DVD issue of this great series. Picture and sound are OK but there are NO special features and they hacked it up with tons of useless ""chapter headings."" The tape version is better."
2,There should be 5 tapes with this series,"I saw this originally on PBS and this set indicates that there are three 2 hour tapes on the box. Well, the tapes are only an hour long each and there are some ""episodes"" missing. The episode which is depicted on the box cover is not even in the box. I remember that this scene was narrated that the English general saw armed farmers and ranchers watching his surrendered troops and he believed he saw a ""new generation"" of man. It was very powerful. I couldn't believe it wasn't in the box and I sent it back to Amazon after viewing it....I was very dissapointed that I couldn't own this full series."
2,Spoiled,"I guess I'm spoiled by Ken Burns. This documentary has actors, in period costumes, talking to the camera, reciting the lines where in a Burns documentary, we'd be treated to pictures, drawings, paintings etc. with an actor doing the voiceovers. I much prefer the latter as I found the use of actors talking to the camera distracting and at points even irritating, which detracted, for me anyway, from the documentary's content."
4,"Great video ""collectible"" - if a little too ""apple pie""","All in all, a great video series. I found the explanations of military engagements very useful and easy-to-comprehend. But its ""suitable-for-framing"" Norman Rockwell conclusions were arrived at without serious consideration to the compelling argument that the American Revolution wasn't really all that ""revolutionary"" - that it was basically a power shift from one elite to another. Still, this is worth a watch no matter what your political orientation may be."
1,liberal garbage.,"As I stated this is such a biased liberal American hating story, I returned it.A true shame that the biased liberal media is not concerned with truth.As is evidenced by the election.You will get what you deserve..."
2,Be Aware of loose opinions from this series,This series paints a picture of our founders as being pretentious attention starved wannabe nobles.Not a very good documentary.
2,Deceptive description - BAD movie,"Wanted to rent a comedy, I like George Clooney, what happened? This was make me want to jump off a bridge depressing. Their jobs are sad, their lives are worse and it has a an unpredictable ending that isn't what you want to walk out of a comedy with."
2,another george clooney movie... bleh,"Wasn't worth the 2.99 I paid to rent it. It was a different story line than anything else that is out there now, I give them credit for that, but it was just bleh. I was pretty much bored the whole movie."
3,Acting can't save mediocre movie,"I got this movie expecting great things. It was nominated for multiple Oscars, including movie of the year, best actor, and two best supporting actress. Its a fairly light weight film. Clooney plays a man who works for a company that lays off people. He flys around the country, laying off people. He has no personal life so he prefers to be on the road. While on the road, he mets a woman who also travels a lot. They have a one night stand and then starting hooking up regulary while they are on the road.One day, he realizes he wants a real, lasting relationship so he tracks her down, only to find that she is married and has a family. Kind of depressing really.The acting is good, but the plot itself is nothing special, just a lightweight romantic comedy."
2,Rock & Doris redux,"I can't fathom why this had so much hype. There was certainly nothing special about it-just another updated Hudson/Day flick, except with ""NEW! IMPROVED! SEX SCENES!"" Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga *BOTH* nominated for BSA? Really?? Schmooze away and you'll get a Nomination! I guess it really is about Academy politics. As Mo'Nique said, ""I would like to thank the Academy for showing that it can be about the performance and not the politics."" I was relieved when she won. The performances here were not nomination-worthy, just average. Clooney was fine, again nothing special. Pair this withThe Hurt Locker(not as over-hyped but just as over-rated) and it's tedium at it's finest."
1,Pathetic ending and very little drama or excitement in between,"I was ready to give this movie three stars for being mediocre but watchable. Then came this horrible ending like those songs that just fade away. Right away I dropped two stars and unfortunately, I had to give it the lowest Amazon rating. Some writers commented on the chemistry between Clooney and Farmiga. They do nothing most of the film and then she just walks away when he shows up at her door to find she has a husband and family. You call that chemistry? I call it boring. I did enjoy the part played by the young girl, although her acting was strictly minor league. I suspect I will get slammed by other readers for this review. That is fine. I have to say what I really feel."
3,George Clooney,"George Clooney must I say more! I was hoping the ending was better but at least it wasn't real sad, I do not watch movies with sad endings!"
4,"How hard is it to say, ""Your position is no longer available""?","Ryan Bingham's (George Clooney) job is to fly around the country and fire people for companies who don't want to do it themselves. He likes his work and his life, which is uncomplicated by relationships or domestic demands. On one stop-over, however, Ryan meets a female version of himself (Vera Farmiga) and sparks fly.The success of this movie must be due entirely to the charm of its leading man, because it is in no other way unusual or special. Clooney is indeed quite likable playing a slick smooth-talker while Farmiga is good in an undemanding role, but neither perfromance was worthy of an Oscar nomination in my opinion. The plot is pleasant enough, but hardly memorable, so I don't understand all the hype about it. It was just okay for me and I've already forgotten most of it. 3.5 stars."
5,Up in the Air DVD,I received the movie in excelent condition and in a few days. I would order again from them.
4,"in our time, for our times","A movie for the current times, Jason Reitman's latest work is touching and melancholy and doesn't provide any substantial resolve. The movie also asks a very interesting question about technology and to what extend can technology be used to replace people in the workplace. How much can really be outsourced these days?"
4,Different and Somewhat Boring,"Clooney is the movie even though he has a strong supporting cast of two delightful women helping him. The plot was the boring part from the standpoint that I have never heard of anything resembling his job and job functions even though I had over 30 years of managerial experiences. He was a convincing ""bumper"" who was lucky he did not have bad things happen to him. Had it not been for the two supporters this movie would have been a 2 or 3 star at best. Additionally, throwing in a little bit of sex only addressed the script's weakness. It was a tad bit much for the writer to attempt making us believe that George was so stupid that he did not know the necessary secrets of his bunkmate. In fact. it made both of them look stupid but the title should go to the writers. The music was quite good; however, the sound mixing was mediocre at best. On a slightly off topic subject, I hope someone can help me by explaining how this standard DVD differs from Blu-Ray disk."
1,Not a Entertainable Movie,The scenes aren't written good. It was a very dull 10 mins that i tried to watch this movie. I usually enjoy anything with George Clooney in it but not this one.
1,Complete waste of time. Dull and very boring.,I understand why they made the film...but it lacks in every possible way. The film is just boring. Don't waste your time.
1,boring film,i seen this in the theater and it was so stupid. not one thing about the film was funny except the fact that george clooney is actually in the film and that its getting alot of acclaim.clooney is a great actor but i hate this movie. i wasted hard earned money to see this film but i wish i could get my money back and the time i wasted watching this film
3,boring,I thought it was pretty boring. I can't say as this did anything for me. It was a sad movie about having to fire people. YUK!
4,A well executed film about a serious issue,"When we saw the first trailer for this movie, we expected a light comedy with George Clooney as the main character. As it is the case with almost all of his movies, there are light and even comedic moments spread throughout the film, but it's not a comedy per se. The film starts on a light note, showing us how life on the road (or the plane)looks like for many of those people, traveling for weeks at a time. The main subject itself is anything but funny or light. People are losing their jobs right and left and this film shows, how it is mostly handled by the big corporations.The director was able to show the individual pain that comes with the loss of a job and how the person on the other side of the table can't really feel, what the now unemployed person experiences - until it might hit them too.A very well executed film that makes you think, but doesn't put you down in any way. Recommended."
2,Up in the Air,It's ok: got to LOVE big corps that want to save on the very labor that built them.Save for a rainy day by the fire.
5,Flying high with George,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this movie. I like George Clooney, and try to see his films, but this one was very different from what I expected. Actually, I think if I'd heard more about the story line before I bought it, I might have passed it up. As it was, I bought it and really liked it!"
3,Interesting movie,"I'm not a big fan of Clooney. His political views are diametrically opposed to my own, but I do like the other actors and actresses in the movie."
2,"Good acting, but underwhelmed","I was a bit disappointed in this movie. I love George Clooney, he's a great actor. And the acting overall in this movie was great. But the plot and ending left me a bit underwhelmed...it was ok as a time-filler, but I wouldn't recommend anyone run right out to see it."
3,breezy little film (3.5/5),"this was in interesting little film.it's basically about a guy(George Clooney)whose job requires him to live out of a suitcase for at least two thirds of the year.he flies around the country to different companies and tells people they been terminated from their positions with their company.basically he feels most at home on the road,so to speak.there's more to the story than that,but you'll have to watch the film if you want you know more.i thought the dialogue was clever and witty and the chemistry between the actors was good.and Clooney creates a sympathetic character.Jason Bateman really impressed with a small role.overall,i felt this was a breezy little film,with some serious moments.for me,Up in the Air is a 3.5/5"
2,"Sorry, terribly disappointed","I am glad someone else enjoyed this!I am a huge George Clooney fan, but was terribly disappointed. With most every aspect of the movie.Sorry, but I am glad I rented and didn't buy.If you buy, you may love it. I hope you do, but I will notrecommend it to anyone I know."
1,Man this movie is awful!,"I am utterly baffled about the high reviews people have given this movie. It makes me think, ""what were they smoking?!"" or ""who got paid off to write a bunch of fake accolades?""I cannot tell you sufficiently as to what a waste of time this movie is because it is truly that bad. But that is not the worst of it.The worst is that this movie will put you in a deep funk. It is truly depressing. There is not a single positive spin, moral or message you can place on it. Suffice it to say there is no happy ending.I have a very intellectually challenging job. I watch movies as an ""escape"" Not only was this movie a terrible waste of my time, it put me in a miserable and depressed mood.I cannot fathom what type of person would like this. I don't care how artsy or avant garde you are in your movie taste. There is NOTHING redeemable about this flick.Waste your time watching something that will not ruin your weekend by putting you in a deep and dark malaise."
3,Okay flick,"This film was good overall. I like most of George Clooney's movies, and this was about a 3 out of 5 rating. Kind of a surprise ending, but does reflect true life scenarios."
3,It was ok.,I would have been disappointed if I went to the theatre to view. It was fine but not great. I lost interest a few times.
1,Borrrrring.,"Looking at George Clooney for 90 minutes only goes so far. This movie was terrible. I felt like I was watching Groundhog Day all over again. Clooney flies all over the country to fire people. The movie shows George in an airport, shows the name of the city on the screen, Georges fires someone, George is back flying again, city name on the screen, fires someone, etc., et.... It never goes anywhere of interest. The fact that he and the supporting female character were nominated for academy awards is beyond me. Neither put in a ""wow"" performance.Don't bother with this one."
1,Horrible,"I decided to see this movie in theaters after all the wonderful reviews about it. Everyone seemed to rate it very highly. First off, the intro and opening credits were horrible: the music was so awful I wanted to leave then and there, not to mention the camera views and picture quality. After surviving this part, the movie kicks off. None of the people were that memorable or likable. And NOTHING happened. I kept waiting for George Clooney to return home, to change his life, to go after the woman he loved, basically to do anything to prevent me from getting up to leave. The only reason I stayed was because of all the reviews (which I now know to completely disregard). It was a total waste of time and money, and absolutely pointless. From now on, I will make my spontaneous movie-going decisions based on the OPPOSITE of the movie critics reviews. I *strongly* recommend skipping this one."
1,dont believe the hype,"I cant believe the hype this film is getting - or maybe I just didn't get it. It starts off ok enough Clooney in cruise control playing George Clooney just like every other film he is in. Then oh oh trout pout love interest Vera Farmiga shows up - with the worst body double you have ever seen for the nude scene - and the film becomes yet another sappy rom-com.But what makes this worse is that while it tries to take itself seriously regarding lay-offs, unemployment, love marriage, whats the point of it all blah blah - it runs off down the buddy movie path with that old cliché of the old pro (Clooney) and the young eager but green new recruit ( Anna Kendrick ) who Clooney takes under his wing and guides her through the job while she helps him become a better person.Oh dear how many movies have tread this wearisome path. Not interesting not funny not particularly well acted - how on earth did this get such glowing reviews from the critics?"
1,Snooze,"I work in the aerospace industry, and I usually love any kind of movies even remotely related to aviation. I've also liked a lot of George Clooney's other movies, so I thought this would be worth paying the $5 to download on-demand. I was wrong about that! It was a snooze-fest. Long and dull. I would wait until you can stream it on Netflix for free."
5,LOVED IT! LOVED IT!,"This movie was great! Don't want to give anything away, but I spoke to a few people who really couldn't stand the shoe being on the other foot for a change. George Clooney is just so likeable, and Vera Fermiga (sp?) and Anna Kendrick were both fabulous.A really different movie, loved the family in northern Wisconsin, everything about it was authentic and you could see the price the main character had paid for his no-strings-attached lifestyle. This is a movie men and women will both like. I actually watched it twice, and I am not a chick flick kind of girl. This is NOT a chick flick."
3,"Good movie, but lower you expectations for this one. . .","I'm not sure what I'm missing that put this film at the top of so many critics lists for best film of 2009, but I'm not seeing what makes this film so exceptional. George Clooney plays a man who loves his isolation, traveling and his job--firing people. The current economy has made that aspect of the film a relevant topic, but it's only an aspect of the film. It's mostly about growing up and figuring out what you want from life. ""Up In The Air"" gives an interesting character study and is written in such a way that the ending should have you talking; it is by no standards a bad film--just an overrated one."
2,Clooney as Clooney,"George Clooney once again playing himself in a romantic comedy which is really neither that romantic nor funny. Don't get me wrong, Clooney is always pretty good as himself. The story is very, very slow moving. Editing is terrible- the story gets very choppy and even confusing in places. Interesting premises to work with-business travel, relationships on the road, making a successful career out of firing others - but the supporting cast and editing really get in the way. Watch the deleted scenes-they would have really helped make this a better movie. There were scenes in the movie which didn't truly make sense until I saw the deleted scenes. Not a bad movie, but disappointing because it could have been a really good movie with the right cast and director."
3,"Entertaining, but hardly great","Is it amusing? Yes. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is there a message at the end? Yes. But is it this amazing, fantastic, best movie of the year that everyone is saying it is? Not really.Is it the ""feel-good"" movie it claims to be on its packaging? No. See all those people smiling in the photos for this product page? Misleading. A big, fat lie. And that's a big clue as to what it knows about itself. It will not appeal to people who are looking for a feel-good comedy. You have to be prepared for ""depressing"". Nothing wrong with that, but I hate misleading packaging. At least it's nowhere near as dishonest as the packaging for ""World's Greatest Dad.""Sorry to rain on parades, but I thought fair warning is needed, after seeing all those glowing reviews. It's an OK movie, and you'll probably enjoy it (as much as such things can be enjoyed)."
2,Meandering and Pointless,"As always, Clooney's charm power is force ten. But not even that can lift the dead weight of this pointless and unedited journal of misery.Please, spend your time some other way. Any other way."
4,Surprised me,"Thought this film was going to play out like your average love story, but I was wrong. Great movie with a nice twist that'll keep you interested until the end."
4,Up in the Air,"Good story line, well acted. Some predictability but some surprises also. And of course George Clooney is not hard to look at."
3,A character that doesn't change,"In most books or movies, the main character goes through some kind of traumatic event or experience, and emerges changed in some way. Sometimes the change is so exaggerated that it isn't believable, but, when done right, there *is* always some kind of a change. In this film, I kept rooting for the borderline-unlikeable Ryan Bingham to change in some perceptible way and, though he comes close, that doesn't happen. Also, the ""plot twist' with Alex is too easy to guess. Still, this film has its moments and the irony that even corporate hatchet men may fall victim to technology is intriguing."
3,underwhelming,"this movie is strictly average, i'm not sure what all the hype is about. it never transcends the basic plot of a business frequent flyer obsessed with himself who tritely ends up looking for deeper meaning. too many scenes of airport terminals and chain hotels just end up reminding me of dull connections. thumbs down"
1,Used to like it.,Bought this long ago and we watched it a few times. Threw it away when Clooney came out in support of BHO.
3,OK,Ok film. Very predictable and transparent plot. Wonder how much the companies paid for all the in-you-face product placement. You could pass an evening watching this but there are better ones out there.
3,"JUST WHAT YOU EXPECT,BUT WITH A SLIGHT TWIST","I FOUND THE MOVIE A RELIABLE PORTRAIT OF MODERN DAYS,JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE TINK ABOUT THE CHOICES TO BE MADE IN THE TIMEFRAME OF LIFETIME,AND WHEN THE HISTORY IS ABOUT TO BECOME A COMMON PLACE THERE`S A TWIST.A FAIR ENOUGH MOVIE."
3,"Expected more from an Oscar-nominated, much-hyped film","I had really high expectations of this film after all the hype, critical acclaim, and award nods - but the reality for me was that this is just an average film. Clooney is just Clooney (read Danny Ocean) and, although the idea had legs, I don't think the writing was all that clever, provocative, or funny. Anna Kendrick is the only bright spot in an otherwise somewhat blah picture and the only element of the movie that deserved any nominations this award season."
4,Up In The Air: a different twist on eval of values,"People willingly limit themselves to a narrow walk w/ an occasional step outside, but come back to a set of values and who they belong with. Entertaining twist, and you'll never board a plane the same again."
3,disappointed - hype got me,"A very truthful movie but slow and somewhat disappointing. Commercial hype got to me and I just expected more as did the rest of my family that watched it. Award winning, I think not!"
2,"Where it belongs....,","Nothing offensive here; a charming little number, well acted and nice to look at.But at some point I was sort of wondering why I was watching this film.Directing by numbers."
3,Down on the Ground,"It began well and peeked my interest. The plot is well written. As the movie moves toward the end, Clooney has a revelation that there is more to life and he has let it slip away. Perhaps the movie must end here but it felt empty."
4,Easy to follow plot!,This movie is delightfully written and easy to follow ! The plot is one that many who travel for a living can relate to! I am retired from that rat race BUT enjoyed the perks of being a frequent flyer as well as a frequent hotel lodger!!The length of the movie was just right. Perfect ending and I would love to see this frequent traveller get into other situetions!! Great opportunity for a sequel!!
3,ok...,ok movie - a bit slow but tolerable and entertaining. I don't like the way Anna Kendrick talks: total loss of femininity that is so common in US among some women.
5,brilliantly written,"The beauty of this film is in the writing imho - a very timely approach at examining the current economic climate in America and how it affects those on both sides of the issue. The nuances are brilliantly framed through the lens that is Clooney's character (whose acting definitely deserved the academy award nomination that he got), a man who is on the 'safe' side of the layoff business but whose personal life leaves much to be desired. The acting, scriptwriting, directing are all too real - if only corporate America had as much insight as this script-writer, America might still be a pretty good place to live."
5,Career & Relationship Limbo,"Job security is a concept that belongs to another era. In this day and age, workers have to keep adding to their skill set to prepare themselves for promotions ... or, if they are job-eliminated, to be able to survive as entrepreneurs or make themselves attractive to their next employer. UP IN THE AIR gives an original and enlightening look at the precarious nature of life in corporate America in this day and age. 5 Stars!"
4,Great Movie,"Another entertaining Clooney flick. The guy really is a modern day Carey Grant (with a bit of Rat Pack thrown in). This movie is a perfect vehicle for him, and he does a great job at portraying this thick skinned, no strings, company axe man. It has a great story with great performances. Talent definitely didn't skip a generation for director, Jason Reitman (son of Ivan Reitman, director of the Ghostbusers franchise)! Check it out."
3,They Edited Out the Funniest Scenes,"If you get the DVD be sure to check out the deleted scenes. I don't understand why they removed the best scenes, but they did.As it stands it's just okay, and becomes predictable. George Clooney fans will love it though, so definitely see it if you enjoy his acting."
4,much better than expected,"i had mixed feelings going into this one as Clooney has never been a real favorite of mine. i was, however, very pleasantly surprised. the entire cast is very good and deserved the round of oscar nominations they received. the film is very much a product of its time and to me, kind of felt like kindred spirit to The Graduate. even the score allows you to make some comparisons to that classic. very well done and enjoyable film."
1,Disappointing,"This book was a disappointment as a gift purchase. First I found the paper book cover and spiral plastic binding to give it a cheap inferior appearance. Secondly each page was illustrated with the same pencil drawing of a golfer.Before returning the book I gave it to my husband to look at the contents of the book, he wasn't impressed."
1,toaster doesn't work,"How do you get the toaster to work? The manual (which, by the way, has several errors in the translation) says to ""connect the toaster to the mains supply and switch ON."" Huh? I plugged it in a wall outlet and pressed the lever down - nothing happened. Also, the lever would not stay down until the 3rd try. It looks nice though."
3,Toasters aren't what they used to be...,"Not a bad toaster, just not a particularly good one either. Bought it to replace a vintage toaster from the 50s and that toaster could toast perfectly. This one toasts more on the outside sides of the bread than the sides facing the center. Also, there is little leeway in settings between toasted nicely and burnt. Looks good though."
4,toaster,It's a toaster. What more can you say?I do like the red 'STOP' button if you smell smoke.Rheostat seems to work.
4,Great introduction to dominoes,"I purchased this set of dominoes for my 3 year old while visiting an arboretum. It is such a cute and colorful set. She picked up the concept of playing dominoes very quickly using the animals. It's very colorful. My only negative to this set is that I wish it had more pieces. We played with 3 people and it was way too quick - but then again, I guess you don't want a really long playing game for a 3 year old. If it did have more pieces, there would be more animals and it might make the game even more challenging.Overall, I am very pleased with this set for children. It teaches dominoes but also matching and very very basic strategy with fun artwork."
4,"Fun for adults, too","I actually purchased these dominoes to use with my father who had had a severe stroke, and to use with my mother and husband who had much diminished eyesight. While some of the pictures were too similarily colored for those with very bad eyesight, children will easily recognize the images, and the animals pictures are a little more exotic. We all had a great deal of fun playing with them. The dominoes are made of cardboard, so will probably not hold up for those in the sucking stage."
4,I like it as my daughter's first game toy~,I like the pictures of this dominoes game~My 2-year old daughter likes to play with me and her daddy~
3,Nettie's Aqua Ring,"I got this ring as a gift for my sister. For the money I was very pleased, it's a fun little ring."
2,Easily misshapen and lost stone,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. At first it looked great ... then she wore it. Even though she did nothing rough while wearing it to cause any damage, the ring became misshapen very quickly and easily, and one of the aquamarine stones fell out within three weeks. This may have been from how the ring went out of shape but neither should have happened to easily and quickly. Quite disappointed. I would suggest looking elsewhere for an aquamarine ring and save yourself the money and disappointment."
5,Liszt by Chailly,"Nevermind that Liszt is many things to different people...the facts are in his music to hear for yourself.What you have here is a great symphony by a great composer, performed by a great conductor and orchestra.If you liked the Saint-Saens 3rd, Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, or anything of the ""excessive"" romantic reportoire, you shouldn't miss this work."
4,Big Brain Academy,"I have been playing this game for several days. Not really a game but a training program for the brain like Brain Age. Some of the training exercises took me a while to understand. I am a middle age woman as of today a ""C"" brain grade. Kind of addicting because now I want to get an "" A"" score. Even my 11yr old son will play it and says it is fun."
3,unappealing to 9 year old son,"He got it for Christmas and has yet to play it as far as I know. Not the biggest draw for him. If a child asks for it maybe he or she would like it, but mine is not interested."
3,Like Brain Age Better,This game is somewhat hard to understand and hard to follow. I much prefer the brain age games to this one.
4,Brain Age,I LOVE the oriduct. I gree it CAN get boring. It is funny and really makes you think. think there should be a little bit more instructions. I think it helps you remember things and analyze objects closer.
2,Not my favorite cartridge,"This cartridge is not one of my favorites. The information repeats over and over, and the game-play can become rather boring very quickly. Some of my other cartridges always offer some new and interesting twists all the time and always seem new. This particular cartridge gets real old real fast."
5,LOVE THE GAME & IS A CHALLENGE,THE GAME HAS MANY CHALLENGES AND DIFFERENT LEVELS. IT'S A GREAT GAME TO MAKE YOU THINK. YOU USE PLAIN COMMON SENSE ON SOME AND OTHERS YOU HAVE TO GIVE MORE THOUGHT ON. IT IS A GAME FOR ANY YOUNG SCHOOL AGE CHILD TO ADULT. I'M 47 AND IT MAKES ME THINK BUT I REALLY ENJOY IT AND RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES GAMES.
5,My 9 yr old loves it,"My 9 yr old is transfixed with this game. There are a handful of brain puzzles that score based on speed and accuracy. You can compete with someone else, take a ""test"" to get a score, or do ""practice"" games. He has ignored the Monkey Ball game for this ever since he tried it and gets prouder and prouder when his scores improve. Whether you kid will like this or not probably depends on how much he/she likes brainteasers and puzzles; mine loves them, so this hits the spot."
4,Good time killing game,"My husband thinks this is a time wasting game, I thought this is great, I got to train my brain everyday bit by bit...hehe...improve myself. He doesn't like it because I've beat him with the test of brain weight. hahaha"
4,Yeah Im Smater Then You,I really enjoy playing this game. its one of those fast pace thinking game where your brain gets a good workout. i honestly believe this is a good game for children. i know all the stuff on it. if your a parent this game here is a great investment.
3,Doesn't hold kids' attention,"My son got this for his 10th birthday. He likes it and played with it a while, but it doesn't hold his attention like Mario or Spider Man games, which he has played with for much longer."
4,Best brain game for the DS - more staying power than Brain Age,"Of all the ""big brain"" titles out there on the Nintendo DS this is the one that my wife and I end up playing the most. As with most DS games the graphics and sounds are basic and juvenile, but this title features 15 different tests that all are challenging enough to keep you interested. Each time you take a complete test the computer randomly gives you 5 of the 15 games making sure at least one is selected from each area like Thinking, Analyzing, Computing, etc. Each game/test is 60 seconds long and much like the SAT it gets harder or easier based on how well you do on each problem. Brain Age might look a little slicker and have some bells and whistles like speaking into the microphone, but more often than not those features are annoying and playing this game 5 minutes a day is much more satisfying. I know they also make a version for the Wii but I haven't given that a shot yet."
3,Big Brain Academy,"Fun. Stimulating. I like having both this AND the Brain Age as both are missing options the other has. I'd like to see more software like this and even more that encourages child education.WHAT IF: Schools offered cartridges of Math, English, Science, or other cirriculum on these devices?WHAT IF: There were software for these things that helped children study for their ""standardized testing"" in school?Why not disect a frog virtually?BBA is fun game which keeps the mind occupied and perhaps does stimulate areas which we tend to neglect after school years. I'd love to see something like this that teachers ENDORSED! Its much cheaper to go buy a used DS or SP than have to buy a PC or (if you know better) a Macintosh. While they offer more functionality, they don't fit in a child's pocket.Lets see more games like Big Brain Academy on these devices and get more FUN, Portable, Education. Not just BLAM BLAM!!"
4,Good workout,My son can't get enough of it. I prefer to have him addicted to this game than to others which don't test a player's mental agility as much.
4,The whole family enjoys this game.,"My daughter who is 8, asked for Big Brain Academy for Christmas. I was skeptical she would like it, but as it turned out, she loved it. She finds the tests challenging. My husband and I tried it and liked it as well. We all recommend this game."
2,Not so great,A little boring and not very challenging. This is probably a good game for a teenager or young adult. Haven't played with this for nearly two years.
2,Buy Brainage instead ...,I totally regret buying this game. I bought it thinking it'd be more like Brainage and even got to play the demo of it but it was totally not what I expected when I got the real game. I'm totally disappointed bcuz there's not a lot of mind games and I'm sure everyone scores about the same and the way they score you makes you feel like your stupid. I should of just waited til' I found a store that carried Brainage instead. That game scores you by the age of your brain not by the weight of your brain. Totally not worth your money. If you really wanna play this rent it from BlockBuster or something cuz you'll get tired of it real quick !!! I know I did. (T~T)
1,Don't buy for kids,"My daughter just opened the game and I""m appalled. They don't even ask their age before they determine that the kids gets a D on the test. My six year old was so disappointed and then wanted to know what getting that job meant. WOW! As a teacher I find this practice unbelievable. You may not disagree but there is a tactful way and a positive way to give feedback for a child."
2,"Repetitive, gets old really quickly","Big Brain Academy is a collection of repetitive ""games"" that test your memory and vision. You can choose to test yourself or practice. Either way, the number of game choices is limited -- and unlocking practice games is a pain as you need to play the same game in each category over and over (even if you score well each time) in order to advance. I'm surprised the other people found this fun. Well, I got a B- on my first test and in a couple days I scored an A. I guess maybe I'm too smart for this. (But I admit I was stupid to have wasted $20 on the game, so I guess I'm no smartie after all.)"
3,not as good as brain age,I don't think it is as good as brain age because the graphics suck!Serious.
1,This game is lame,"I can't believe so many people like this game. It sucks. I played it once and that was enough. No goal, no plot, no story, no purpose. Just below level and not entertaining mini games. Nobody I know played it more than twice. I'm amazed at these high reviews."
2,Not very good,This isnt an amazing game. You quickly feel like you have done evrything over and over... because you do. Get Brain Age its a lot better and more fun.
5,"Great story, very well read",Great modern classic read very well by the voice of Rafaki. It's nice to have the music from the movie with the story too.
4,Very good but not prefect,"The headphone works well and the sound quality is good, but the ears get warm if you listen for a long period of time."
4,Good Book about Vizslas,"This is a good book for someone who wants to learn more about the breed! It may seem to be small, but it's packed with information-a great value for the price. If you want to learn more about training your dog, then you may want to purchase another book for more specifics."
4,Exellent 1st book about vizslas.,"Exellent book to start with when you are trying to make up your mind about the breed. Short and to the point. Although definetely not an ""owner's bible""."
4,Vizsla owner,"This book was pretty good for general information. If I was going to buy just one book, however I would buy Versatile Vizsla by Marion Coffman. It is very detailed and full of good information. It does cost a little more but it is well worth it. This book is also good for general info if you dont have the money to spend on Versatile Vizsla."
5,Very Informative,My daughter and her husband bought a Vizslas puppy and this book helped them train and raise him into a good family pet.
3,Basic,"This book provides a basic overview of the Vizsla. It offers helpful tips on training that can be applied to any dog. If you are looking for a book that really gets into the actual breed, you may be disappointed with this book."
5,Cool PEZ set!,I don't know much about the OC Choppers...I'm just a PEZ fan. Cool set though and seem rather detailed. Average size.
1,No Good,"This isn't what you would expect from a Girls Gone Wild video. Unless you have extra money that you don't want, I wouldn't recommend this DVD. I was disappointed."
1,Item is Picture is NOT the correct pan ! Beware,"Sorry, I love Amazon, however errors occur, and the picture is not the pan. Pictured is their Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick 12-Inch, 5-Quart Covered Saute Pan 94.99 dollars. That is a great pan, I had one for years. The picture should be of a flat griddle........"
4,perfect crepes,"I've had this pan for about a month now, and I really love it. I used it to make crepes and french toast. The non-stick coating works great, I never add any oil to the pan before cooking and so far so good. The pan has a comfortable rubber grip and a very sturdy handle. My only complaint is that I wish they had made the handle slightly lighter. It is heavier than the pan itself. It's not really a problem for cooking, but it makes the pan a little tipsy if you don't put it down on a flat surface."
1,hump in center,"the pan I received and didn't return in time, came marked as a ""freebie"" for buying a set and has a domed center. The bottom is flat, but the interior is not, thus anything placed in it tends to cook quicker in the center and any butter or olive oil or anything you use to saute (I use this as a large fry pan) pools at the edges, leaving the center exposed and ""dry."" I bought this to replace my old Anolon classic griddle that I burned up forgetting it on the stove...this is a sad replacement and I only wish I'd remembered to return it inside 30 days."
3,"12"" griddle","So far this griddle is OK, I would have cast the pan a bit heaver (thicker) for the best heating: size is actually over 12"" like 12 3/8. I wanted a 11"" unit but had to try this 12"" unit. I am replacing a Analon 13"" griddle that is much heaver but the size (diameter) is just too large for my cooking requirements: two person household but it works great. so this 12"" unit has so far been OK. I would like to see how it is in 5 years as is the age on my 13"" unit which is still as good as new. Time will tell. Its difficult to find an 11"" unit in best quality any where so I settled for this 12"" unit."
2,Cd Review,"The CD wasn't what I thought it was going to be which may have been my fault for not reading the details, I'm not sure. The music just wasn't as upbeat and 'young' as I wanted it to be. They songs are a bit slow and outdated in style."
5,ONE TERRIFIC ALBUM,"Contemporary artists give their renditions of traditional hymns, and it's terrific. There is also a piano & voice book that goes along with it, from which I've performed four of the songs in public, and have gotten excellent responses. The lady that accompanies me always comments on how excellent the arrangements are. I wish they had done more than the two albums, but this one is the best. You can't beat Amazing Grace, I Surrender All, Because He Lives, Take My Life And Let It Be, etc. - all on disc 2. Each artist gives their selection its own unique twist, which I like. The only disappointment is Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus, by Michael W. Smith - it's just too short. But great double album otherwise, and a steal at this price. Waitsel"
5,Hymns 4 Worship: Amazing Grace,Very relaxing and inspiring. I use at the end of the day to drift off to sleep. The second CD has more of the commonly recognized hymns.
3,I seriously hated the ending,"This book started off nicely, and I think the author had a great idea, what with the all-girls boarding school and all. However, the ending left much to be desired. I couldn't help feeling a bit cheated because the ending just left the reader hanging. I didn't like the way the story cut off, with the reader still wondering what would happen to the characters. Or maybe I'm just an idealist, disliking everything that doesn't come equipped with a nice, happy ending."
3,,"I did enjoy this book very much. This was a book I had picked at random to the interesting explination on the back cover. At first impression, you may think Lexie is a beautiful but a bit screwy character. Reading on, I seemed to have mixed feelings about this character.She confused me and just at time I smiled, and others I just got very angry. When later when we find out about Lexie 'fibbing'(I'll leave it at that.) then I got really angry that I almost threw down this book. Jinx's standing up was very refreshing. Overall, I find it a very nice book."
3,The book did not end well!!!,"The book was great, until the end. I dont think that the book had closure. I wanted to know what happened to Jinx,Miggin, and Laura. We never find out what Jinx really wants through out life."
3,"Well, i read all of it the first day i got it","Even though i stayed up until 5am reading the thing doesnt mean it was perfect, i was sooo curious of how it would turn out, i aslo had the same problem jinx had and we related. Its hard to find such a book as this one, i wish there were more."
3,"Great show, great musicians, but......","I attended this concert in Montreal before the DVD was released. It was really great. It is a chance to see Greg Lake, Howard Jones, Sheila E., Ian Hunter, Roger H. from Supertramp and the others on the same stage. With all these great musicians, the live performance is incredible. Songs like ""lucky man"", ""take a long way home"", ""logical song"", ""give a little bit"", ""no one is to blame"".I have two complains. First, there are no good extras on the DVD, just the concert and a 8-minute featurette. Next, the setlist is incomplete. At least, all hit-songs are there, but there are at least 2-4 songs missing, like the good ""In the court of the Crimson King"" by Greg Lake. The concert is not very long, less than 2 hours, so why taking out such great songs ?Great buy if you like the musicians and Ringo. Check the setlist first to ensure you like the songs."
3,Good concert,As a concert it was good enough to watch but the lack of good backing band lets it down. Let's hope they release a full concert DVD of the version with Peter Frampton & Jack Bruce.
4,"Lotsa Roger, but the rest?","Supertramp fans are in for a real treat with Hodgson performing several of the band's biggest hits. The magic is still there, folks. But one song only for Greg Lake and Ian Hunter? Both are rock icons and deserving of a little more attention. Can't deny this is one nice package of artists for viewers who have a fondness for classic rock."
3,Nice Souvenir,"I enjoy this DVD as a souvenir of having seen this concert.The backstage footage was inconsequential, I use the skip button a lot when I watch it.The lineup wasn't stellar, but this was a really fun show"
3,Good but not as good as Badd Blood!,I own this video and its ok but just not as good as Badd Blood!The main event was The Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels and it was a great match but it leaves you hanging.The main event ends in a no contest but theres a rematch at the next ppv Badd Blood which features The Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels in a hell in a cell.Now that's better.
4,I like this p.p.v;(Stone Cold fan),"I like this p.p.v.It was an cool p.p.v.I liked when Stone Cold stunnered J.R,that was pretty funny.I wish they still made the WWF/WWE p.p.v's like they did in the old days.And an ol hell yeah!"
3,Good Ideas but needs to be Updated,"I was very excited to receive this book but a bit disappointed when it came in. It seems to be outdated and not good for visual people like myself! I am used to books by Mailbox the Education Center and this is nothing like that. It looks like it was typed out by a typewriter and photocopied, I just can't get excited to read it."
5,Good product,"We bought this to go with the SAMSONITE VM-102S All Steel TV Wall Mount for 19"" - 21"" TVs (SAMSONITE VM102S) it works exactly as we hoped it would. We used it on a combined DVD/VCR and it fit fine. A great space saver and helps to prevent the hanging cables from the TV to the VCR/DVD."
4,"Now, I gave this a four out of five but...","I actually love them. They fit all of my needs but you need to know that you actually have to wear shoes on under the boots. Because of that, the boots are stretched out every time you put them on. As such, my boots now have some holes at the seams which actually defeats the purpose."
3,Just okay,"My boys liked this okay, it is loud and clear and speaks both Spanish and English. They find the Spanish highly amusing for some reason (they are two and three). If you are looking for a fun phone for your child I'd recommend giving them an old cell phone or an imitation cell phone (Disney makes them) because I know with my kids they seem to always prefer to play with the real thing or something close to it."
2,Unimpressive but Heartfelt,"This CD has horrible production; it sounds like it was recorded in someone's basement (which it probably was).The first two tracks sound like some teenagers are playing music from ""The Addams Family"" while chanting in Latin to Satan. It is cheesy but somehow charming. The rest of the songs suddenly burst into dirty-1980's-punk-rock chord progressions which have a notably dark & oppressive feel; the bad production somehow adds to a creepy ambiance. These songs are interspersed with wild, fast tapping solos which seem a bit out of place against the comparably plain music; the songs are carrried along by slightly distorted growling vocals.Altogether, its unimpressive, but certainly worth collecting if you happen to be a rabid fanatic of the early efforts from satanic bands, or like the sound of a bunch of teenagers trying to be evil in their basement."
5,The reference on the subject.,Look no further if you want a detailed illustrated reference on the CB750 ! Doubles as a great coffee table book too .
4,Great guide in studying English Literature,"I bought this book for my high school age daughter when she was studying for the English Literature CLEP exam. This book is like a dictionary in that people, places, terms are arranged in alphabetical order and includes a paragraph or more about each topic. It is to be used as a reference guide. If a student needs to find a certain author or book he can easily locate a brief description. It is a handy book to have alongside other study materials and the internet."
5,why Baptists Don't Dance and other Tales from Doc and the Ra,"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE FUN, HUMOROUS, AND WITH LOTS OF GOOD SOLID INFORMATION ABOUT THE LIFESTYLES AND PRACTICES OF SOUTHERN PROTESTANTS AND AMERICAN JEWS. I LIKE THE SETTING IN THE DEEP SOUTH, NEW ORLEANS, MEMPHIS, LITTLE ROCK. THE ADVENTURES ARE GREAT FUN, AND EXCITING. THERE IS DRAMA, SEX, MURDER, SCANDAL, INTRIGUE, AND OF COURSE END TIMES PROPHECY. THE FORMAT IS EASY FLOWING AND THE READ PAINLESS. THE HEROES DOC AND JAKE ARE JUST TWO AMERICAN MIDDLE AGED MEN, LIVING LIFE WITHIN THE PARAMETERS THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN. LIKE MOST OF US AT THAT AGE, THEY ARE ASKING THE ETERNAL QUESTION: IS MONEY, SUCCESS, MARRIAGE, FAMILY, ALL THERE IS? ENJOY"
4,Good to have for the price.,Beeing a former rough framer this set is far from professional quality. However it's great to have around the house for everyday repairs and little projects.
3,Doesn't do her justice.,"This ""Best of"" collection doesn't do it's job.Fans will bemoan essential missing tracks, which, if you are bluntly honest about these sort of things, is unavoidable.Those wishing to sample this unique artist will be poorly served, as this is nowhere near as ear-grabbing as ""Martinis & Bikinis"". That record, or the ""Indescribable Wow"" may be a better jumping-on point.Nice to hear a few tunes I was not familiar with, but I think the album I'll return to most, of hers. will be ""Martinis"""
2,Appropriate Title...,"Contrary to what the above reviewer stated, this is an album for DIE HARD (as in you are such a fan you actually shelled out seven bucks to see the artist in Die Hard III) Sam Phillips fans ONLY. The curious selection of ""hits"" and remakes suggests this Best Of collection is for people who already own her other work and are looking for something new. Unfortunately, it fails on almost every level. The two ""new"" songs are lackluster at best and everything else has been heard before. To make matters worse, Virgin insists on charging the absurd retail price of 17.99. Amazon's price reduction lessens the sting a little bit, but I would still recommend buying The Indescribable Wow first and then getting into her other great albums gradually. This way you will avoid that burning sensation that I'm feeling as I write this."
2,An unnecessary release,"While Sam in very telented, this recording is a waste of money and time. These are not remixes (and I am quite disappointed that she would call them that). Check out any of her other recordings, they're great. This CD is an unworthy addition to her catalog."
5,I love this stuff,We run a rescue and had some Poodles turned into our local shelter with Ringworm. I bought this and it cleared it up right away.. Have had no more issues at all the puppies look great and all got forever homes..
1,Do not buy,"I bought this product because my son had a ringworm in his head and I didn't want him to take the pills that they wanted to prescribe to him. I bought this product and it did not work. I tried some other holistic approaches e.g. lemon juice, potato slice, etc. those did not work. The only product that got rid of his ring worm - again in his head was Lamisil AT. Lamisil AT got rid of his ringworm in his head (and he gave it to me on my arm) in 1 week. I massaged the cream over the affected area twice a day for 1 week and it was gone. Lamisil AT is an antifungal cream that gets rid of jock itch and ringworm and it can be purchased over the counter."
3,audio compression problem,"A fine performance all around, but unfortunately spoiled by audio compression. The dynamic range of this recording is less than 30DB. What a shame!"
2,Camcorder Batteries,"The batteries I bought didn't solve my problem...Red light flashing/incomplete charge. The red light still flashes; however, the batteries seem to be charged. I'll hold on to them because they seem to be working."
5,Super Insights,"This chattly volume by a team of husband and wife social scientists offers great insight into the workings of the human personality, and how to handle it."
1,Does not work.,This sounds like a great product. I had one in my car for a long time and the one time that I needed it it did not start the car. I recharged Charge-It and it still was completely dead. Do not depend on this product. It just gives you a false sense of security.
3,Sandra's review,Overcome Neck and Back PainI had looked at a friend's book and it had a particular exercise to stretch the muscles over the side ribs. I cannot find this excercise in this book. Apart from that it is a great book.
2,sherri reader with neck pain,Someone bought this book for me from my yoga class and I thought I would pick up a few new tips. It was okay nothing to write home about- maybe good for someone who doesn't know how to exercise. There are better books out there.
4,Swiss-made. Good Product. Recommended.,"I am an avid wine drinker. Not an alcoholic (at least not yet), since I only do 1-2 glasses a day.That used to be a problem with unfinished bottles going bad very quickly. Not anymore.This Swiss-made wine keeper set works as advertised, keeping the wine drinkable for at least another 3-4 days. You simply use one of the included wine stoppers and pump to get the air out of the bottle, and then store it in the fridge. The next day, you open it and whoa!!, you can still enjoy your wine.The construction materials are on the cheap side (rubber and plastic), but the price reflects it, so I cannot complain."
4,Your target heart rate and how to achieve it!,"This video gives you the information you need about your target heart rate zone, exactly how to figure it out and achieve it. At the end you can actually take your heart rate with the timing done for you. The warmup is thorough and concise, the dance movements are easy to learn and follow, especially for the inexperienced or older person. Mirabai's soothing and motivational manner make it something you can and want to do over and over again."
3,Slow Paced. Boring!,This video is okay for some. I didn't enjoy it as it is just boring. It's very slow and too much talk.
1,wish I had rented it first,Too short and not enough stretching to do me any good I am veryinflexible right now after cancer treatments. I have found Total Stretch for beginners by Tamilee the perfect dvd for me.
2,not what i expected,this has one 'dance' routine. for the money there should have been more. very moderate pace. short explanation about taking heart beats per minute. way over priced considering it only contains one 'dance'. slow enough for a beginner.
2,Elevator Music,"The workout is easy and what I was looking. However, the elevator music drives me nuts and her voice is annoying."
2,disappointed,The pictures for this particular one were very dark and hard to distinguish what you were looking at. The whole product is disappointing because it only makes one quick little sound or says a few words per slide - not in any way telling a story.
3,Disappointed,"Is it Christian, yes. Is it for a child under 5, not really. The zoo dvd starts off with the kids being scared going to the zoo. That concept isn't even in my childs life yet. Also the other story had the lion eating the baby lamb, another concept that is to big for a little one (3) to understand. I immediately took it out of the dvd player and said, maybe in a few years. Seems like the only safe series is Barney, just wish it was Christian. Even veggie tales is too much to understand at this age."
5,"great product and a great price,","i'm not about to get rid of my cd collection, been threw too many changes records,tapes 8tracks then cassets it stops here and now sherwood cdc5090r front loading carousel multi disc player, like i said great products,great prices and fast delivery what more could you ask for. keep up the good work! mike"
1,don't do it!,Recieved The Sherwood 5 disk player. Looked Great out of the box! It never worked! I wouldn't suggest this product to some one I hated! To much of a Hassel to send it back over 130.00 bucks! The instructions on return is at best a joke! Threw that piece in the garbage!
2,Poorly Designed Product,"Unit is very awkward to load CD's into, controls are located within 1/2"" of the door, and the carousell only rotates in increments of 2 disks. It's a big pain in the neck, and to make matters worse, it's very sensitive to any scratch on the CD, and won't play CD's that other players have no problem with. This is a unit you will not be happy with, and I recommend that you avoid purchasing it."
2,Disappointed with this player...,"sounds good, easy to set up and operate but doesn't seem to read CD-R's. i have burned some Christmas CD's that will play in my car and bedroom system but not on the Sherwood. If you don't play CD-R's then this is ok."
2,Not what it seems,"First, on the manufacturer's website it clearly states that this model has a headphone volume control. I bought this item because of that feature. It does not have a headphone volume control. Secondly, the machine will not load a CD without help. Try to load a CD and it will give you an error message. You have to wait until the tray has completely withdrawn and then you have to give it a final nudge for it to work properly. Other than those two things the sound is decent and the other features work well."
1,Should be named Skipper,"This product was terrible right out of the box. It skipped playing cds, but only when it felt like playing cds.Won't buy a Sherwood product again."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought this item SPECIFICALLY because it said it did RANDOM SEQUENTIAL PLAY. My old Sherwood had this feature and it is VERY IMPORTANT to me.When I got it, (the second one, the first one was poorly packaged and damaged!) there was no sequential play feature and the sound quality was very tinny. THIS PRODUCT IS VERY POOR! YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!"
1,Fakin' It,"Nothing like starting with a few false premises and going downhill from there.If this thing IS meant for converting official state atheists in the former Soviet Union, then maybe the author really thinks the Estonians and Khazakhis are too dumb to breathe.Don't blame me -- I didn't write this mess."
4,Good introduction to apologetics,"For those not academically trained in theology, philsosophy, or apologetics, Beisner's book provides a nice introduction to key questions and their possible solutions. The well studied skeptic will not find all the arguments convincing, as Beisner does not offer his book to such an audience. I have successfully used the book for interested seekers who would not be able to follow more sophisticated arguments offered by figures like Alvin Plantinga. At the end of the book, Beisner offers a list of recommended reading for advanced studies in areas such as philosophy, logic, science, and so on. Having studied under Beisner, I have found him to be a constant help in answering hard questions, some of which were my own."
4,Great Smooth Jazz!!,"If you like Smooth Jazz, there are some really fine tunes on this album. A great find for my music collection. Enjoy!!"
2,the seedfolk,Rebecca Ray11/15/05Reading reportp.2SeedfolkI am reading Seedfolk it is a pretty good book. The first chapter is about a girl who gets a community to sponsor a big garden for everyone to plant one little plot of ground. The garden space was a vacant lot. The girl starts out using the lot to plant a lima bean and help it grow. Then an old laity saw her watering it and desisted to plant a plot of land with assort of things.THEN all the rest of the chapters are on other people how com together because of the garden and they meat one another in some of the chapters. The old lady and the young girl met in chapter two.
5,Love it. will buy more books,Very good for class. Good read Teacher said this was a very good book. SeedFolks very good read. How do you rate 10
2,Do not recommend,"This day and age we need to atleast let our children read about the positivie side of life. Seedfolks, although not totally a waste does have parts that I feel is not something a fifth or six grader should concern themselves about."
4,Lots of unnswered questions!,This book was very good! It had lots of unanswered questions though. I liked the way the author wrote every chapter in a different character's point of view. I didn't like the way he ended the chapters right when you started getting in to it. They were also very short. It was very interesting because everybody was different and came from different places.Rebecca 4th grade
3,Not for fifth grade!!!!,I teach fifth grade and I bought this book from a school book club order. I have always trusted the books I receive from Scholastic book orders to be appropriate material and I do not preread all the books I put in my student library. I brought this book home this weekend because I could not figure out what level to put in the back. I went to Amazon comments and read several reviews. It's a good thing I did! This is a good book but certainly not appropriate for the grade levels 4-6 or ages 9-12. This book is appropriate for middle school. The parents in my room would have been very upset if I had given this book out to read in Literature Circles.
4,Summer reading,"Our daughter is going into sixth grade and was given this book as a summer reading assignment. She hated the idea, but ended up really loving the book!"
4,From a seed to a community,"Seedfolks is a book that tells about friendship and community. It takes place in Clevland in a poor neighborhood. One little girl goes out to a vacant lot and plants some lima beans, and soon everyone is beginning their own gardens.I liked this book because it tells how gardening can be fun but hard work also. Gardening also changes many peoples' lives and it makes them happy. It doesn't matter where they are from or what they are like. Everyone just works together. Seedfolks is a great book."
2,RASUL.,"I didn't like the book because it has no action.Paul Fliechman, the only action you had was when sae young got beat up and thats what I thought about SEED FOLKS."
3,"Not bad, not bad at all...","I read the book in my 4th period Reading Class. I must say, it was really touching, but somehow my mind kept drifting of and starting thinking about something elese, so at times it can get boreing , but however, the book may be real good at times, the chapters on Sam and the lady that was in the cleaners were real good.. 3/5 get it!"
4,Perfect in the classroom when discussing diversity,"Fleichman does a wonderful job exploring the differences among people of various backgrounds in this easy read. Although the reading level says ages 9-12, it would be appropriate for teens and adults also. I use it in the classroom, and students enjoy making connections as the novel progresses. One chapter, Marciella (I believe), could be viewed as controversial because she is dealing with the emotions of an unwanted pregnancy. When reading aloud to sixth grade students, I chose to skip that chapter and never mentioned it to the kids. We all enjoyed Seedfolks and the discussions it prompted a great deal!"
2,left me hanging,"We did a lot of class activities with this story and I think it was the worst one yet. Seedfolks was a good book because it taught about all different kinds of diversity and how people can come together. What readers arn't prepared for is the ending. The ending is completley blank. You see each chapter focuses in on a different character's point of view, only one chapter, then it goes on to another character leaving you hanging. At the end they have no info on what happened to the character's after their chapter. For example one chapter told a story of a child and a dad who were trying to plant something to raise money, the child talked about having a new bike and a better life and all but it just left off at the part where they planted their seeds! I found this book very boering and I would not put it on my read list."
3,Seedfolks,"Seedfolks was a pretty good book. It has very little words so people like me can understand. It was kind of confusing since there were so many characters, but the second tiume I read it I could understand it a lot better.My English teacher REALLY likes it. We have been reading it and listening to it. The setting makes sense for the book. Since it is so short, I can finish it in a little bit and it doesn't get too dull."
5,very short read but very powerful,I loved this book. I bought it on a whim thinking some of my less motivated readers might want to read it. I can't wait to use it in the classroom in September on the first day. It's a great blend for language arts and social studies.
3,Seedfolks-short and sweet,"Seedfolks by Paul Fleischman was a great series of short stories about how a community became whole as they linked together to begin a community garden. Through the efforts of one young lady, person after person found meaning and contentment in the garden. It is a great story for a classroom setting, because it makes so many connections with different elements of society, ethnic and multiracial groups. It is a great book to read and then pass on."
4,Seedfolks,"Used this book for a course being taught to middle school teachers. Well written and perfect for literature circles, which we did with middle school students"
2,Over-Monotonous!!!!,"Although this book had a very good moral to it, it became extremely boring. It seemed that each chapter almost had the same basic idea, that they were either depressed or lonely, so they planted something, with a few exceptions. I read this for a 7th-grade assignment, and everyone I know didn't really appreciate it. I definitely don't reccomend this for anyone under 11, because of reference to dumping children in garbage cans (Maricela) and cheating (Curtis)."
1,seed folk,it was boring cause it all was just what the people in the building were doing and thinking at one time.
1,planting a communtiy,"The story had strength as well as weakness. Its strengths included describing the way people plant their seeds. This method helped me understand how very important it is to know what you're doing when planting seeds so you can have a great outcome .The major weakness was the part of Florence, which could have been given longer to develop her character better.My overall impression of this story was that it was wonderful. I can't believe that just by a little girl being so sad and taking her pain to the vacant lot to plant her some seeds made the whole the community come together."
1,NOT THAT AMAZING AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS,very very stupid. im not moved or grown. no matter what they say its not a good book. its not very good its not entertaining its not moving. its old. and stupid. the stories are to distant. none of them connect.
2,book for kids,"The whole story is about a garden that was an emptylot filled with garbage and infested with rats until a little girl planted a bean seed and gave a few people hope on life. Like this guy Curtis that believes if was to plant a tomato garden he could win back Leticia's heart. The entire storie is about people trying to do their best in life, with the hope of a garden?I think the strength of the book is mostly about how people found a better way to live or interact with others alot better than they did before the little girl started the garden. I believe the main weakness was how a 16 year old girl wanted to kill herself all because she was a young mom and was'nt truly accepted.My overall impression of this book was unsatisfying, boring. It just wasn't my kind of book I'm not into stories about people's lives and how a garden affects them in life situations.I would recommend this book to a 12 year old girl thats into nature type of stuff, It struck me as a little girls book."
1,Snoozer,i was excited about this book...until i read it. there are too many GOOD books out there to waste time on this one.
1,suck folks,"what a magical book that teaches us all about diversity! except it's written horribly, has no plot, and well sucks. I read this for school and was horribly bored. buy this for your enemies and force them to read it. Their heads will e4xplode from boredom."
4,seedfolks,SEED FOLKSSeed folks is a very interesting book. Seed folks is about a young girl and her friends. The young girls father dies and she decides to plant bean seeds near a vacant lot. She wants to plant a little garden to remember her father. Once other people find out they decide to plant things to they end up planting things such as pumpkins and tomatoes. So if I was you I would take the time to read it!
3,Darius H.,Paul fleiscman why did you write this book? This book is ok. It ok because it has no action. Why did you talk about a community garden? The chapter I did not like was virgil becuse it was not interesting. The best chaptter was curtis. I am not done reading the seedfolks.
2,Down By Law DVD Dissapointment,"The movie itself is just as good i remembered it. But the Criterion Collection DVD package, however, is so totally not worth the $40 plus postage i paid for it. I've gotten so much more bang for my buck with other ""special edition""-type DVDs. i found the interviews and ""extra"" stuff dull. I want my money back."
2,I love black and whites but this grows a little long,I love when a film has such bad lines even the actors seem to be laughing through them. The comic humor is there in this black and white that came out on DVD recently.I've read that the more you know about 'films' the more you will like it. I don't have to be a film concierge to know what i don't like.It's a little too looooooooong and drawnnnnnnnnn out. Black humor doesn't have to be injected that slowly to be effective.
1,Please enter a title for your review,Of all the artists in any medium who seem to get a lot of credit for doing very little Jim Jarmusch takes the cake. This movie seems like something thrown together as a lark by a few buddies after a few beers. I guess advocates of anti-hollywood artyness needed a new posterchild and Jarmusch was in the right place at the right time with the right haircut.
4,"A hikarious jail-break comedy starring Tom Waits, John Lurie","The movie starts by chronicling the descent into prison (for minor offenses) by three very disparate characters (Waits, Lurie and Benigni) and proceeds to follow their exploits in prison and, once they make the break, out. Beautifully shot in black and white, wonderfully acted, and very funny. As usual, Benigni's real-life wife is in the movie. She shows up towards the end, and as usual she is wonderful. There is also a nice cameo at the beginning from Ellen Barkin, who looks so very very young. The entire movie has Jim Jarmusch's sense of quirky humour written all over it - if you like the rest of his work, you will love this movie. If you hate his work, you most likely won't like this one either, but if you have never seen a Jim Jarmusch movie, this is the perfect one to start with."
4,Get something other than explosions and impossibly shallow writing!,"This is a film that I never knew of but for the fact that at the time, I had a large satellite dish. Saw a bit of the movie on one of the hundreds of channels available. I had to see the whole thing. It's a good movie and written and directed by craftsmen not mainstream war mongering moguls. If you like this you must also get ""Dead Man."" One of the most brilliant pieces of cinematography that I have ever witnessed."
5,Tom Waits at his best,"This DVD was purchased as a gift for a friend who is a moviemaker. It is a must see for Tom Waits fans as he is the writer, director, and producer. He also wrote the music of course. This film contains one of the best male/female fight scenes. Ellen Arkin (Loretta) gives an over-the-top performance when she starts throwing Tom Waites (Zack's) worldly possessions out the window. This little low-budget film is a comic masterpeice of epic proportions."
5,ABSOLUT MUST...,"This is the only movie I have ever seen and never forgotten...I have been to 3 continents searching for this video. Please arrange to release it for sale. It is always at the top of my ""best ever seen movies"". Jim Jarmusch is an extraordinary director."
4,SWAMP THINGS,"Textures. Layers of it. Curtains of sinister chiaroscuro draping a seedy New Orleans town. The grey, impassive sterility of a Cajun prison. And the dense lushness of bayou county swampland that seduces like a voodoo incantation. In this Louisiana of the mind lurks slivers of humanity. Or its dregs. Three stooges, in fact - - - singer Tom Waits, a DJ, Lounge Lizard John Lurie, a framed pimp, and a pre-Oscar Roberto Benigni, a chatty murderer. Sardined into a jail cell, they play cards, argue and escape into the gnarled embrace of the tapioca swamp. Junkyard percussion taps out the fractured heartbeats of its three principal shadow players in Jim Jarmusch's beguiling second feature. A chaingang comedy starring Moe, Larry and Godot. Innocuously charming, stunningly acted and so gorgeous, it's calligraphic."
5,A Fascinating Memoir,"What can I say; I loved ""Ben Sidran's A Life In The Music"". I found it a fascinating insight into the influences that molded Sidran's life and character. It was also a great glimpse into the music world from both a performance and business perspective. There are plenty of good, amusing stories and anecdotes and it is well written; a pleasure to read. When I finished it, I was sorry it was over. It has left a lasting impression on me. The memoir of a fascinating, focused, well-lived life. Read it."
1,Not Oki by me,"My experience with the B4350 is that it doesn't live up to the promises it was sold on. High yield toner cartridges didn't last, drums didn't get anywhere near 25,000 copies before quality went into the toilet. When it worked, it worked fine. It was costly to operate. I'm searching for its replacement ant not more replacement parts."
3,OK,"The water flow from the Faucet is extremely slow. I installed an air bladder pressure tank and increased the flow and pressure. I recommend if you're going to install this, to do the same."
2,Defective After time,"We've had the Culligan EZ change filtration system for a couple of years now. It was easy to install and super easy to change the filters. Water tastes great. We're very happy with this purchase!Update: October 12, 2012I forgot to update this a year ago, when this broke. Listen, it is not worth the risk of water damage to your floors. Luckily we caught the leak in time. If it is under the sink, it is out of sight and mind, which can be dangerous if it leaks. Go with a pur filter that is on your faucet where you can see it. I did like the Culligan for the first couple of years, admittedly, but when it breaks, it can be a very bad thing."
2,Weak breakable stem,"This unit has been in our house for three years. A guest bumped the dispenser lightly with a pitcher and the entire top snapped off. The threaded pipe which is used to transport water and tighten the faucet to the sink is made of plastic. It was this plastic part that snapped off with very little force. Clearly a weak design, which when tightened makes it likely to break when bumped or over time. I know ours was not too tight as the faucet could be moved around in its hole. If it were not for this weak point in the design I'd give it five stars as it works well otherwise, looks good, and has a solid feel for the valve."
2,Need skills!,"Installation is a bitch. If your not a plumber or have tecnical skills, you will be frustrated and end up leaving it in the cabinet below your sink! I had to change the supply inlet valve to compensate for the adapter that they had in the kit. In fact I just bought a double outlet valve and dismissed the plastic adapter all together! Prepare to spend more money for parts to adapt or to pay for a plumber...."
4,Clean & Delicious,"My husband installed this product over an existing hole in the sink for a faucet sprayer (which didn't work anyways, so I was glad to be rid of it). Apparently drilling a hole into a stainless steel metal sink isn't as easy as it may sound (we'd asked around for some advice) - you'll need a strong drill, drill bit and a strong steady hand so the bit doesn't jump and stutter over your sink, marring the surface.The faucet mount isn't too shabby nor is as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be. Growing up, my always had the ""press down"" type of faucet for filtered drinking water, so the ""turn the fatty knob to the lower left"" is a little weird - not very user friendly. If it gives out, I'll update the review and probably just buy a different one with a ""press down"" handle. But so far so good! The water tastes delicious and the flow rate isn't too bad - it's exactly what I expected for a water filter."
3,Not all that thrilled,"The unit is awfully cheaply made, not too surprising for what it costs. Installation was pretty easy, as long as you can fit under the sink. But I'm getting such low flow out of the unit that we very seldom even use it."
5,Great Boots!,"I've had these boots for some time now, and they've done the trick marvelously. Great price, durable, surprisingly breathable, comfortable, and people compliment me on them (for some reason) everywhere I go."
3,"Stylish, but not comfortable.","Although I get lots of compliments when I wear the boots, they are not comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I had to buy the Gel shoe insoles to place inside them for comfort."
3,"Some good stuff, but also some not so good stuff","The idea behind this video was a good one, and my conure was very interested in the birds on the T.V. screen (especially the big green ones that are grooming eachother). However, my issue with this DVD was that there were several screaming birds in the background of some of the movie clips (the portions filmed in what looked like a bird store). I've spent months working on training my conure not to scream. The day after my bird sat there attentively watching this DVD and hearing other parrots scream, he spent the entire day screaming. So, he did learn from this DVD; he did see ""natural"" bird behaviors (which is what I was hoping for), but I do not like that this DVD taught him that is is ""OK"" to scream."
5,Keep Your Birds Entertained,I use this dvd whenever I need to be away from home. My birds are always chirpping away when I return. It helps to screen out the street noise so my male cockatiel doesn't keep giving his alarm call when I'm away from home. I believe it creates a more peaceful environment for my cockatiel and lineolated parakeet.
5,Just what our eight parrots needed.,Excellent product. Hours of entertaining fun for us and our birds.Our eight parrots love the sights and sounds of hundreds of parrots enjoying everday life in a flock.We set up the bird's tv with the loop setting for the them to have on in the background.
3,Residential Landscape Architecture: Design Process for the Private Landscape (4th Ed),"I am a student at Kansas State University in Landscape Design, and this book is wonderful for getting ideas, symbols, and disign techniques. My professors own this book, and constantly approve and recommend this book for sudents. Although it is titled for a private resident, professional landscapers use this book also. This is one book you should add to your library."
4,Works as expected,I touched it to a wire in my truck while running and it showed spark. Haven't used it yet in diagnostics butexpect it to be a time saver. The light is a bit dim and hard to see outside-at first I thought it wasn't working.
4,Good buy,"Very inexpensive, and easy to use for spark checking on a machine that runs.Not quite so handy for rope start machines that are not running. Made in USA."
1,Never worked,It never worked. Couldn't find a way to check bulb or take it apart for a bulb change. Very disappointing.
4,works,This does exactly as it is described to do. I wish the light was brighter hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I don`t think you will be able to see the spark if you are outside during a sunny day unless you shield it somehow.
3,Bueno,Este indicador es una especie de tester que al acercar al cable de bujia emite una luz al pasar la chispa que enciende la bujia. lamentablemente deberia tener un indicador de intensidad para saber si la chispa es debil u optima. es algo simple solo para saber si hay chispa o no circulando por el cable.
4,"Good info, meny references","This book has a lot of history and good ideas for both Storytellers and players for Low Clan characters, (Low Clan being defined by the midevil timeline). This book however assumes the reader can reference several of the other published books. The other books (other then the main book) are not required for use of this book, but are handy."
1,Stopped working after a month and a week,"To start, I bought this system because it is supposed to rival the Bose 321 and Sony 2.1 ""virtual"" surround systems at a fraction of the price. The sound was average at best and the top loading dvd tray didn't make any sense. You had to pull out the head unit to put a movie in every time.Quality - After a month and week after purchase the system had a symbol on like the slash indicating no smoking. Couldn't even eject the DVD that was in the unit. It has been 2 months that my system has been with Samsung, until today when they finally offered me a refund.This has been a horrible experience and I couldn't recommend this product to my worst enemy."
4,Great Sound!,"Nice unit high quality sound at max output, worth it. Dislikes: back cover difficult to remove/install, fan noise (noticable when close up and no music playing), tacky blue LED display - default (can be turned off)."
3,beware MP3 incompatibility,"I bought a Samsung theater planning to use my MP3 player via the USB port. Beware- they do not tell you that the USB feature is compatible with only 30 or so players, 20 of them Samsung plus a couple of other models you've never heard of. It won't even accept iPods!Otherwise it works great and is Gorgeous."
2,Samsung TV Sound,"This is a very basic, difficult to use sound system. It is wired so difficult to bury the sub woofer. Using the DVD system is not the easiest of tasks. I am committed to replacing this with a sound bar, bluetooth, wireless Bass system in the near future"
3,satisfied,"I've had this unit a few years now, and for the most part, am happy with it. The up-conversion seems to provide a bit higher rez. I also use a HDMI cable on a Sony HDTV. As time has passed, occasionally images seem to freeze. I'm not sure if that's a nature of its design, with the disk slot upright, allowing dust to get inside? All in all, it's a good unit, provides good audio and video quality for dvds. The radio functions easily. I like having an all in one unit rather than components. It's just not worth the trouble anymore."
5,Wonderful Christmas Music!,My wife got this cd through Amazon and it has really grown on me. It is my most favorite Christmas record these days. The arrangements and instrumentation are really well done. They are country without being sappy or melodramatic.
5,Excellent book,The Greek-American community owe Dabilis and Tsiotis a great debt of gratitude for the service they have provided by publishing the stories of Agganis and Kyriakides.
4,Cheesy TV... Yet it's good viewing!,"The show is mindless TV. It will be remembered like the 1st season of ""Survivor."" A show that captivated millions during a certain point in time.It's a talent search but the twist is, judges Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson, and Paula Abdul get to tell you how you did right after. Did I mention they are brutally honest?The best part is the actual talent search, with the judges going from city to city. It gets a bit cheesy during finals, and ultimately you are not too satisfied with the top 10. Jim and EJay anyone?It's also frustrating to see your favorites mess up, Ryan Starr's ""You Really Got Me"", Nikki's ""Always Something There To Remind Me"", and the seemingly unstoppable Tamyra Gray's mistep ""New Attitude."" But it's still entertaining.If you liked the show buy this. It's fun to watch and it also is loaded with performances. If your favorite one makes it you have at least 12 of their performances on DVD."
1,"Oh, Brother","I really don't know how to even begin.I mean, ghosts? Possession? Some strange melange of CSI, The X-Files, with a dash of Queer Eye For The Straight Guy thrown in for good measure? Oh, brother."
3,Not Roeder's best!,"I have read several of the novels in this series. Whereas Roeder's storytelling has always intrigued me, he failed me on this one. The story is OK and I like that several characters from previous novels are revisited. However, this one seems almost a little far-fetched. The idea of a family living in a ghost infested mansion without electricity in this day and age (I mean pleeeeeeeease)! Anyway, as usual I enjoyed the gay theme of the novel, but truly feel M.R. has done a much better job on previous works. Additionally, there were so many typographical and gramatical errors that it almost made it a painstaking read. Come on Mark, I have always given you high scores in the past and ""we"" expect more from you."
5,ITS ME IN A BOOK,"Amanda's Perfect Hair is an excellent source of inspiration for letting children make their own choices and mistakes. In the book Amanda, the main character, has really long, curly, and thick blond hair. She hates it but everyone else loves it. Amanda gets fed up one day and desides to cut her hair so that she can be herself. Amanda cut her hair and everyone loved it. Now that Amanda was free from her bondage she could be anything that she wanted to be. This book shows children that they should be themselves and helps them to make choices for themselves. This book can also help parents who have trouble letting their children make thier own choices.Thanks, Amanda"
2,donut anger,"The seller did not package with care, had cool pack that melted (cool pack had no plastic , was cloth).This sogged up one of the donut boxes ,had to throw out.Also both boxes had broken donuts as well as both donut boxes plastic top had ripps as though someone deliberatly damaged the donuts.I would of returned my order but figured after reading the sellers profile with complaints of the same problem and the the seller giving the run around , and the people still waiting for their money back that I would just worn you , order at your own risk."
4,Good choice,"We have had this shredder for 2 years now and have had no trouble at all. The only reason I didn;t give it 5 stars was that if you procrastinate and save up a pile of things to be shredded, you may have to give it a break to cool down a little. Otherwise, it is a great purchase."
2,Didn't last that long,I agree with some of the reviews that have already been written about this shredder. For a while it worked pretty well then it slowed down. Then I found a huge wad of half-shredded paper in the feeder that I couldn't get out and which started to split the shredder.
2,lasted less than 2 years,"For about a year and a half, it worked great. Then occasionally it would slow down a bit. Last week it really started slowing down and groaning. I discovered where shredded paper had jammed up into the cutters and was splitting out the side of the shredder! I tried to take it apart and remove the jam (and my warranty if it lasted that long) and the plastic comb under the cutters just crumbled apart! Well, I still have a pretty nice waste basket...."
1,It's a Piece of Junk,"I bought this shredder less than a year ago. When brand new the darn thing jammed about ten percent of the time. After several months it ran slower and jammed more often... now it won't shred a single piece of paper. After a thorough dissection, I learned that the tiny electric motor was not built to last very long."
3,It's okay,"Not enough detail to be effective, and the species specific chapters are too narrative and ""story-ish"". Lastly, everything is related to North Carolina alone. Nothing included for South Carolina."
3,Doesn't stay in position if camera is horizontal; screw broke,"There just isn't enough material that the screw is made of to be tightened enough without snapping. If you don't tighten it enough, the camera will swivel when the tripod head is turned (so that a portrait format can be used). Otherwise, it's fine but I have to find/get another 1/4-20 attachment screw."
3,Not for small cameras like the Canon S95,"I got this for a Canon S95, and it makes the effective depth of the camera about 6mm wider - doesn't sound like much, but the S95 is only 30mm to start with (with the lens closed), so that's a 20% increase. This might be significant if you are trying to use a camera case that is fairly tight fitting. I don't like the way it sticks out on the base of the camera, personally. This wouldn't be an issue at all on even a slightly larger camera, but for a small one like the S95 it can change the size characteristics of the overall package enough to be off-putting."
4,"The price is totally off $9,999.99 is the advertised price....",I want to buy a few but until the price is change I do not think that anyone would buy one at this price. Please fix it so we can buy it....
3,Get what you pay for,This Quick Release accessory is OK. For the cost it was what I expected and meets by needs although I do feel it will not last long and I will need to replace it. The biggest complaint I have is that when connected there is a slight shake causing the effectiveness of the mono/tri-pod to be reduced. It is easy to use though and inexpensive.
5,Will not work on ALL tripods,"The product looks very substantial and I imagine it would work fine on a tripod that would accept it. My tripod does not have a mfr. or product name on it or I would list it here. However, this item will not mount to my tripod, even though the ad said it would work on all tripods."
5,Sima quick connect,The quick connect item works great. The shipping was fast. I recommend this product to others. I will use this in conjuction with a swivel also.
4,Finally someone made one!,"This tripod adapter is perfect for those with both several different cameras and different manufacture's tripods/monopods. If you ever wished you could buy a very inexpensive toy to do just that trick, this is it. I have them on a couple cameras and a couple different size tripods. Switching between them all used to take time but not anymore. The material seems plenty strong with no flex and the ""click in"" is positive and has no slack or give.The only reason I gave it four out of five stars is because of its size. It is larger than a normal tripod/camera mount but for the price still a good deal!"
5,Awesome!,"I got the idea to get this from a youtube vlogger named thefrugalfilmmaker . This is a nice, sturdy, but low price quick connector that you'll love!"
2,Sima quick connect,"This item is functional, barely. It's OK for use with a lightweight camera and standard lens in horizontal position only. With a longer lens and/or vertical position this plastic unit feels underbuilt with a sagging problem in the vertical position. Spend a few bucks and get an all-metal Bogen product, you'll be happier."
3,Not too bad.,"I thought the plate was a bit small, and the release lever is a bit sticky. All-in-all a nice product for the $$."
3,Quick Connect for Tripod,"Fast shipping. Works great, I use it for video and still shots. Great little item that can be stored in camera bag for quick access."
4,Great for what it is.,"These quick connect pucks are great for what they are best at. Not the best quick connect adapters out there, but when you want something to add to homemade camera gear or other mounts that don't have their own adapters you can't beat these things. They are rugged and I added one to every piece of camera gear I own. I also like the fact that the plates have a "" thread in them so things can be put on tripods that don't have a quick connect. I only wish they had spring loaded releases like the one on my bogen tripod head. But like I said, they are nowhere near the quality of the bogen, but I have ended up with one of these pucks on my bogen quick connect plate just so everythi.g is interchangeable."
3,Sima Quick Connect for Tripod,Anything but quick. Somewhat cumbersome to take on and off. Decent quality. does not fit as secure as one would want. You get what you pay for.
3,Good for the price,Quick conect is fairly small and works well. The alignment pin on the piece that connects to the camera cannot be tightened against the bottom of a flat camera surface. The threads on the pressure pin are too short. You can replace the provided screw by a nylon flat point set screw but why should you have to?
3,Nice publication,"This was too long for our planned use. Waws looking for somwthing Like ""Shakespeare in a Box""."
5,Excellent Transaction,"This textbook was in better condition than I even thought - it was like new, and came a lot sooner than I expected. Thank you!"
5,Green Eyes is a Must,"One of the first books I remember reading as a child. My mother still has our copy, well, she has what is left of it. I'm so glad its still available. I'm pregnant with my first child and this is the first book I'm buying for my baby!"
4,highly recommend,"not the best design but still pretty effective for image stabilization. originally conceived for video cameras but i use it for my regular DSLR camera. holds camera pretty still except for those moments when you're huffing & puffing, then you want to disconnect from the chestpod as you're getting lots of movement then. great for times when you can't use a tripod or monopod. also gives more freedom of movement and quicker response than with a monopod. a definite must for low light handheld situations, especially when you don't have a fast lens.haven't bought one yet but am considering a slik mini pro tripod as a possible 3-point chestpod."
4,Used it and liked it,"I liked using it, but not sure if it's needed. Took some weight off my neck, so for that, it's good (bad back and neck). I think the design could be improved by including a harness instead of just a belt, so that it attachés to a harness that goes over the shoulders with a wider flex/stretch material belt that breaths. And, the addition of a tether to the top portion that is adjustable for angled away from body support."
3,Devastating,"The movie was heartbreaking. It forces the reexamination of the past and makes one wonder what might have been. The movie ended so abruptly, there was no closure. If you want to be emotionally purged, then watch this movie and cry."
3,Lonnnnnggggg,"Overall quite good, but it sure drags on...and on...and on. Some scenes just go on forever, and often it seems like what would have made one good scene was split into about three. I thoroughly enjoyed Nicole Kidman and John Malkovich, but I'm not sure what all the fuss about Barbara Hershey was--she wasn't bad, but I didn't find her exceptional either, she just blended in with the rest of them. Mary-Louise Parker was completely irritating, whereas Martin Donovan, Richard E.Grant, and Viggo Mortensen (whose character kept showing up out of nowhere--very confusing) were usually good, but with a few weak moments. That pretty much summed up the film: potentially great, but too long, too pretentious, and too murky on some fairly essential plot points. Still, the scene where Malkovich makes Kidman fall in love with him is great. Really intense."
3,Not really great.,This film bothered me in a couple of ways that kept me from giving it a higher rating. The main reason is the character that J. Malkovich plays. This character(I forget his name) has so little going for him that when Isabel is attracted she looks very stupid and naive(a quality for some reason some people admire and Henry James seems to be one but I equate with stupidity). Anyways I'm not sure if the film is stylistically any good because I'm ignorant in that area. But some good points of the film are the lovely Nicole Kidman's performance and Martin Donovan's(Ralph Touchett).
1,Portrait of a Lady,"I loved this particular perfomance when I saw it on television and decided to purchase the DVD. The quality is so poor, so dark that the scenes are a dark mass with few details, especially the faces, dresses and room settings. I was very dissapointed. I am still waiting for my refund - an ongoing problem since Octoberirecrn@aol.com"
5,Not for Low-Brows,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies for various reasons but the top three reasons are Jane Campion, Nicole Kidman and Barbara Hershey. Jane Campion has taken this amazing book and found a way to convey an array emotions in a stunning visual manner. I scoffed at Nicole Kidman until I saw her in To Die For and then I saw this film and became a loyal follower. I don't care how bad the movie is, she is always worth watching. And anyone who isn't completely moved by Barbara Hershey trying to maintain composure while speaking to the back of someone who obviously is trying shun her should check their pulse. It is one of the most heartbreaking moments in acting I have ever seen. The cinematography is seductive and the music is trance inducing. Gorgeous costumes and amazing performances from everyone involved. Quite frankly a perfect film. If we're lucky there will be a Criterion version of this film with director's commentary someday."
1,The Portrait of a Lady,The DVD didn't work. This is the first time I have received a bad product through an Amazon order. I have no idea how to return or if it's worth the hassle. It is useless to me.
2,Very Boring!,"The movie is beautiful to look at but the story is so boring and weird, doesn't make much sence."
3,Too much emphasis on girl power,"I have a hard time taking Jame Campion's work seriously, because she has such a chip on her shoulder. She'll find a way to present such a male-centered classic like ""Portrait of a Lady"" through her own feminist filter. Once again, she tries to show how wicked manipulative men try to bring down a ""strong idealistic woman"". Really, Jane Campion is better off adapting the works of Sapho. She should leave dead white male authors alone. She and Cher need to get together and organize a self-pitying feminist fest."
3,Something's just a little off,"The moment that I finished reading the James novel, I rushed out to rent a movie adaptation of it. Although the film was visually stunning, I felt that it didn't portray the Isabel, Gilbert, Henrietta, and Madame Merle that I had come to know. I found the book to be satisfyingly depressing, but this movie was just harshly and hurtfully depressing. Also, the finale, haunting as it was, didn't even intimate how Isabel leaves Caspar Goodwood in England and goes back to Rome; it let the viewer believe that she might actually stay with him. Either this was an enormous oversight or I am just missing out on a deeper meaning created by Campion; more likely the latter since no one else has commented on this. Anyway, although it followed closely to the novel, I still found it disappointing."
3,IN LOVE WITH VALENTINA CERVI,"Nicole Kidman surprised me in this role. She is not all glamour. She has a deep acting ability, and while this film was not all that well received by critics or audiences, her performance was stunning. Also beautiful here was the young girl, Valentina Cervi (who is luminous in the film Artemisia) who portrays John Malkovich's daughter. This is based on Henry James's novel of the same title, and Jane Campion (who directed The Piano) delivers a faithful and convincing adaptation."
3,Recommended!,"Kidman was wonderful as Isabel Archer. Everything was perfect in the movie, except for the ending, which was rather abrupt and confusing."
3,what the hell was the point?,The music was good. The music score by Kilar (Bram Stoker's Dracula) was great. The story was boring until the plot thickened when the identity of the real mother of the daughter of John Malkovich's char. was made. The customes were nice and the settings & cinematography was outstanding.
2,The most boring film I've seen in months,Although Nicole Kidman and John Malkovich have a superb performance in this film (that's where my 2 stars go) I almost got asleep watching it. None of my friends who watched the film could stay awake. It just drags on forever. I imagine all films based on a Henry James novel have the same weakness. I guess one has to have a developed taste for such films.
3,What kind of moron can't see through John Malkovich?,"John Malkovich plays this creep creepily just as he played Valmont in the American movie Dangerous Liasons. Ugh. Unknowing girlchiks, here's a litmus test to help you avoid Isabelle Archer's fate: Do you think this guy will ever help you move that heavy armoire up or down the stairs? NO!!! So kick him to the curb, slam the door in his face, IGNORE him. His type has no innate power, he only has power that you give to him.Martin Donovan is all voice and Mary Louise Parker is all scary in this movie. But this might be too much voice from Martin Donovan.Wow. I can't believe that there are people who could ruin their lives like this."
4,"A good addition to the femmes of the sax (Williams, Dulfer)","Who is this woman? Pretty mellow and not to Kenny ""Gish""; a tribute to the growing femmes of the sax: Pamela Williams, Candy Dulfer. She doesn't sound like either of them, maybe more like Pamela Williams with a twist or two of her own. Soulmates and Nairobi are great. Deja Vu' is somewhat trendy and non distinctive. Its worth the buy."
1,"Great Story, poorly written","I'm not a writer, but it feels like I could have wrote this book. Scene transitions are not smooth at all. The story of Neptune Small is a great one though."
2,Not well made,"I ordered this US map instead of the Melissa & Doug version because I like that Mexico and Canada are visible. I hate that the M & D version makes the US look like an island. However, this is a cheap puzzle made of cardboard. The pieces are too tight and it is very difficult to put together, even if you know where all of the states are. We also ordered the Melissa & Doug World map puzzle. My son plays with that one exclusively. He doesn't touch this one."
3,A Fair amount of fun,I would only rate this OK. It wasn't as sturdy as I had hoped. Some of the pieces of the kit are thin cardboard. I might even just say it is thick paper. I don't think it will last for many detective adventures.
3,A Worthy Read,"I'll start this off by saying this is the first EVL book I've read, that halfway through it I picked up two more, and that I plan on reading as many as I can get my grubby little hands on. While some of the plot twists were painfully transparent, they were written in such a way as to keep the reader hooked long enough to find out for sure. The insight into Chinese culture Jian provided was valuable enough to make the book worth the read in much the same way as Chrighton's Rising Sun was for Japanese culture; the masterful plot was just an added bonus. The graphic sex got a little repetetive, but the scenes were short enough that the book didn't get bogged down in them."
5,MAGNIFICENT,"This book contains all the elements for a compelling, and thrilling story. Reader beware, you wont put it down for hours at a time."
4,Not for those seeking simplicity,"I have read most of the Van Lustbader, Lustbader, and Ludlum/Van Lustbader novels and am impressed with this author's knowledge base and ability to pull off complex and intertwined plot lines. He also creates--in his solo works--memorable characters. However, be prepared for extensive intermixing of decades and locations, detailed decriptions of cultural and historical phenomena (largely Asian), and most of all apparently distinct plot lines, often somewhat puzzling when first introduced, that intersect and eventually merge. Like his other works, Shan is a serious book requiring considerable effort by the reader. That's not a bad thing, but be prepared!"
5,Excellent book for selection of colleges.,"For the person who have no idea what colleges they go to, and what to look for in colleges. The book guides you through with a self-assessment survey in the beginning that allows you to prioritize between preferences you may have for colleges.The most useful part of the book, however, is the catagorized colleges. Unlike other books that list colleges by state or alphabetic order, this book lists the ""brain"" colleges, the liberal arts colleges, the ""specialized"" colleges. This allows me to find colleges that are similar to the ones they are interested in.Also gives significant insights into the colleges with long and informative commentaries on each of the profiled colleges.Also includes a section on the admissions process itself.The only shortcoming is the fact that not too many colleges are included, but the ones that are are amazingly done.I spent an entire junior year trying to choose colleges. This book did the job in a few hours."
4,Nice,East to assemble. Has held up well. Rides well. Sometimes the steering needs to be re-aligned. What else can you say about a bike? Good value....
1,Heavy and so badly made,"We purchased this bike for our 10 year son, we had it checked at our local bike store before giving it to him (they told us it was badly made!). The first time he rode it the wheel locked up, then the front brakes snapped, the chain constantly came off and finally after only 3 weeks of him riding it the gears on the handle bar snapped completely! Along with that it is so heavy you can do very little on it except peddle!I wouldn't recommend this to anyone whose child does more than just ride down the street!"
1,Bike Review,Product had a bent back rim and bent front bar that doesnt sit right on the ball bearings. Would send it back but we are going on vacation and we wouldn't have time to send it back and receive another
3,good inexpensive bike for youth boy,Quality of the bike was okay but be careful when trying to adjust the cables. The ends pop off really easy and then the cables fray out. I recommend crimping the caps on the cable ends before you start. Other than that pretty nice bike for my son.
4,Good bike - easy to assemble,"I am 5""2 and bought this bike, assembling was very easy except the spoke adjustment and breaks could have been good, setting up breaks was hardest part.Seat is not so comfy, so i had to buy a schwinn seat which is also not so good.overall the ride is good and worth for the money."
3,Seems fine after a trip to the bike shop...,Though this isn't a top of the line bike (and priced accordingly) we spent enough that this shouldn't have required a trip to the bike shop for assembly. After trying unsuccessfully to align the wheels and get the brakes on properly we brought this in for professional help. $75 later (plus $15 to replace a badly designed kick stand) the bike seems fine. It appears that Mongoose needs to get some tighter controls over their production line.
5,It's the BEST!!!,I think that this tae is a good Tape for anyone who need to leon on jesus and just concenrate on god.If you are doen and out just pop in this tape.
4,A surprise in each story,"Jeffrey Archer reveals his talent as a story teller in this surprising colection of tales. As the title suggests, each story has some kind of ""twist"" that leads the reader to imagining a whole picture just to find out a different reallity at the end.Easy fun reading at each page."
4,Complete package for a woman of the world,"Jessica Bennett, I am new to your line and very excited about your line. This shoe is so sexy, yet stylish. I purchased this shoe in turquoise and pink. This shoe runs a half size too small. I purchased it in a 8.5 and 9, both will work because I had to have the pink (which was only availabl in size).The color is vibrant, cut of the shoe is stylish and sexy simultaneously.NY Shoe Princess"
4,Not consistently interesting,This book can be quite boring as it repeats the same scenarios over and over. It would be 5 stars if instead it had concentrated on the highlights of Francis's adventures. I think the authors realised this towards the end and made for much more exciting and inspiring reading.
5,girls kissing girls,what can I say about this movie but hot hot damn HOT women stripping kissing and rubbing each others clits sucking each others nipples I think my covered liutentant was at full staff with this movie he reallly really liked this film
5,Birth of the Political Reverend,"In this exuberant film Ossie Davis really shines. Godfrey Cambridge is superb as ""Gitlow""(if only his singing was as great as his acting). Self ordained Rev. Purlie preaches amessage of ""Freedom""! It strikes me a freedom of a dubious sort kind of like""Change"" does today. The flow of the rhetoric throughout this film is a linguisticmarvel. Alan Alda has the only purely virtuous role in this film. This purity wasthreatened with his ""Hind legs line"" but then he had to communicate with hisConfederate flag displaying Pa somehow. This movie is well worth watching!"
4,"Great, especially for the price","I purchased my last set of brake pads from AutoZone and they began warping and running down my rotors. So I did about a days worth of research on affordable and reliable brake pads and became aware of Akebonos (and one or two other brands). These pads were in my price range, so I decided to give them a try. After running them for about a month, I haven't noticed any fading or noise coming from the brakes. They seem to stop well without creating an excessive amount of brake dust.All in all, very happy with my purchase, and will keep coming back to this pad in the future.Used on a 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer ES. These were the rear pads. I used ACT866s on the front."
1,Brake pads,"I am giving these 1 star because I needed a front brake pad set, and these are for the rear brakes (which it did NOT SAY in the description). The quality of them seemed good, and they appeared to be well-made, but I cannot verify how well they worked because I did not install them on my car. Returning for a refund, and ended up just buying a brake pad set from Auto Zone."
3,"Ballad of America, Volume 1","I was intrigued by this CD b/c I am a US History instructor and wanted to play some of the songs for my classes. Although an unusal resource, I found the voice too ""nasal"" and off-key in several songs."
2,don't buy,doesn't really work that great it is easier just to pour it out works great with water but oil is extremly slow .
2,Not that helpful,"It's kind of a pain to empty used cooking oil, so I was excited to try this. The following aspects make it dissapointing:* The motor is underpowered. It empties the oil slowly, and sometimes you have to turn it off and on several times before it ""catches"" and actually starts to move the oil.* The food sediment in the oil sticks to and clogs the filter. To get it off you have to stop the motor, let the food bits fall off, and then start it again (which might or might not happen the first try). Maybe this happens with all oil filters, but no matter what it makes the experience with this one frustrating.* It requires three D sized batteries. You're not supposed to leave batteries in things that you don't use frequently, so depending on how often you fry you might end up putting in and taking out the batteries every time you use it.To be fair, even though it didn't live up to my expectations I still use this instead of just draining the oil through cheesecloth or something."
2,Does Not Do the Job,Filter mesh is too fine to suck the oil through so it takes a lot of time cleaning the filter thus making it a lengthy ordeal. Easier just to get a funnel with a screen or a tukey pot with a built-in spigot. Do not waste your time messing with this product.
4,questionable,"The first time i used this, it worked well. Not fast, as has been stated here, but it did a nice job. The problem i ran into is storage, i think. I stored it on its side, and after several months of non use, it wouldnt work. Oil had seeped into the battery compartment, and the batteries were coated. They were still good, and after cleaning them and the compartment as best i could, it still wouldnt work. I will buy another one, but i think i will store it upright. Maybe this will keep the oil out of the batteries."
1,Save your Money,"This pump could NOT pump warm cooking oil out of the pan. I gave up and went to the hardware store and purchased a large funnel with a filter. In my opinion, it is a piece of junk."
1,Disapointment,the pump is extremly slow and just dose not pump the oil out very good. I would not reccomend this to anyone.
2,Disappointing is an understatement,"You get what you pay for. And that's true in this case. I had an OLD electric fireplace hater that blew the heat like you wouldn't believe. It must have been pre-70's because the cord was still covered in cloth. It died (moment of silence, please) and I wanted to replace it.I'll tell you, in the time of gas fireplaces it hard to find a replacement of comparable quality without spending $500+. I purchased this item and it's mediocre at best. It doesn't blow any heat and it's just inferior. I'm sorry I bought it but I took my knocks as they came. Moral of the story - spend the extra money and get the quality you want. Or better yet, save and convert to gas."
3,NG with wide screen,This is a great product that cannot be used with my camera.I own a Panasonic PV-GS500. It is a top of the line3CCD wide screen camcorder. The problem is that the viewingLCD screen is wide to accomodate true 16:9 video. The bracketis not quite big enough to fit around the screen.
5,Video Bracket for Camcorders,A handy item and reasonably priced. The SIMA SVB-1 2-1 Video Bracket fits the need if your camcorder doesn't have a built in light. It's well designed and very useful. I recommend it.
5,camera or video bracket,"This device is very handy and well worth the price. Can be used on cameras, video and many flash units."
5,sima video bracket,I purchased the bracket because my camcorder has neither a video light or a built in bracket to hold a light. The bracket is exactly what I needed to complete my set-up.
3,tripod attach?,"can you use it with tripods, meaning is there a socket on the bottom of that screw to take standard tripod 1/4 bolt?"
4,"A decent, small shredder","Overall, I do like (and will constantly use) this shredder, but it does have one annoying feature: if you put a piece of paper in JUST right, the cut size is sufficiently large (~ 32mm x 4mm) that an entire phone/SS number can appear on one of the shredded strips. Shredding 3 sheets at once is the listed limit, but it can do 8 sheets slowly, and 6 sheets with little trouble."
1,"Jammed, and no solution.....","When I first used it i tried to shred 6 papers at a time, which was a mistake... It got jammed in the middle of the papers. When I tried to reverse it, it went for about 1mm then got jammed again, tried foreward, jammed, backward, jammed. Tried for about 3 times, then I gave up. I picked the papers out, half by half.. When I thought it was all out, I tried running it foreward again, still jammed.. I found little scraps of paper causing the blades to be jammed. I am going to have my husband fix it. I may just be a 26 year old female that doesnt know much about electronics, but I think that is sorta pathetic."
1,Only good thing about this book is the cover,And that is why it rates one star .... Seven young Parisian ladies meet at their 'cafe klatsch' and decide to lay bare their first sexual experiences ...The premise is great but my goodness not only are their first sexual experiences boring but the way the author portaris them makes this book hard to read and even more boring ....If this is one of your first erotica books I can understand why you would probably never want to read another erotica book ... ever ......
1,Comedic!,"I had to try one. Then I had to try another. I mean, the guy named himself ""Christopher LOVE""! His intentions might be good, but the scripts are shallow, repetitive, and contain too many negative words. Creating affirmations 101: always use positives! The subconscious mind is unable to decipher negative statements and absorb only the intended meaning. The music is mediocre, at best. The echo-effect is annoying. His booming, theatrical vocals are absurd and not at all soothing. In fact, some of the statements and the manner in which he delivers them make me laugh out loud. For that, he earned one star!"
5,Absolutely WONDERFUL!,This download has been so great for me. Ive had no issues with my download. NO WAY NO SKIPS. I was really impressed when I saw where Christopher Love himself replied to the review with a guarantee of no issues. It works for me and I have recommend it to everyone I know. I was on Amazon today to see if any of Christopher's other CDs were available as downloads. I hope to see more titles soon!
2,Not really a cult book,"I bought this book because I expected to read about life within a cult. Although it has some of that, it is mostly about a dysfunctional family. The author experienced a loving, but unfaithful father. Her mother was the committed parent, but was overly critical. That left Ms. Castro pinging between her parents. Not what I was looking for.Ms. Castro's narrative goes back and forth in time, which makes it a bit difficult to follow. She uses this technique to gradually peel back the layers of her life. However, it's usually difficult to tell where it's going.She writes in an engaging enough style, but it just doesn't work for me."
1,Very sad story.,".Joy's story is a sad one indeed. -- But why does she title it ""The Truth Book... Escaping a Childhood Of Abuse Among Jehovah's Witnesses?""While her abusive stepfather claimed to ba a Witness, he obviously never adhered to what the Witnesses teach. She never mentions any other Witness who in any way abused her, so why ""Among Jehovah's Witnesses"". How many Witnesses is she condemning?She talks of good times with Her ""Beloved Father"" who was a Witness up until he decided ""A Blonde"" was more important to him than his faith, his Wife, and his Children. Had her father remained faithful to what he knew from the Bible, none of the negative things that happened to Joy and her brother would have happened.I can't understand why in the book....he get's absolutely no blame from Joy for all the harm he caused by abandoning his family.Perplexing.."
5,"Plugged it in, it worked","Sped up my daughters' computer so they could play thier silly games, kept them off mine. Shipped quick. Can't ask for more."
5,Worked as Advertised,"Bought this memory to increase from 1 GB to 2 GB in my AMD desktop. Didn't have any problems with it at all. Installed, booted and everything worked!"
4,Nice brush...,"I ordered this brush when I accidentally lost the brush that came with my norelco shaver. I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the brush with my norelco had both a wide soft bristle end and a narrow hard bristle end. This one is soft bristle only. If you need a brush though, it gets the job done."
3,There are better imports then this,"Since this is Garbage, I cannot hate it, but, I don't love it. Lemme tell you what's included here: The Trick is To Keep Breathing (normal song), Can't Seem to Make You Mine (new song), Tornado (recorded on their tour bus), Special (remix). It's not bad really. I understand Garbage was just having fun and were probably bored out of their minds when they recorded the bazerk ""Tornado"", but, judging it as the lame song it is, it's pretty icky. It's mildly catchy and fun, but it's icky. ""Can't Seem To Make You Mine"" is very Rocky Horror sounding. I don't know, that's just what it reminds me of. It's pretty good. The remix of ""Special"" is peaceful, but, boring. Overall, this is an import to skip since you can get CSTMYM on other imports."
3,Hold your breath,"This was somewhat of a dissapointing Garbage release. As a collector,this CD offers nothing new. The UK release of ""When I Grow Up"" parts 1 & 2 (Mush43CDS & Mush43CDSX) already have the previously unreleased ""Can't Seem To Make You Mine"" & ""Tornado"". The UK CD's also include ""When I Grow Up - Danny Teneglia's Club Mix"" which is quite good and NOT found on this CD. Of course you would have to buy 2 CD's compared to just one to get the extra track but Garbage is a great band and worth it. This CD would have been better had they of put a remix of the title track on it. It is unlikely that they will release a UK version of this like they did with every other single on Version 2.0."
1,This could have been a great film...,"I really mean it, but the characters in this film were too dark and foreboding. This film is really depressing and the characters really let their emotions flare up. Everyone treats each other terribly until they realize it. Skip this one for something else."
2,Strap broke,After wearing the it for 2 hours the strap broke where it meets the case of the watch. I'm sure it was just one defective watch as sturhling usually makes excellent watches.
4,Beautiful Watch!!!!!!!!!,"A really very nice watch, super nice quality, elegant, good size but not in excess. If you would like to make a present, this one is going to be perfect!!!! I love it!!!!!"
1,Watchband came off once I put it on.,"One of the best looking watching I've ordered. Sadly, I took the watch out of the box, put on wrist, walked about 10 steps. Watch fell off my wrist - band came off the watch. Metal part of where watch attaches is either badly made or defected.I've read what others said about the band and took my chances - now believe the watch band attachment is an issue."
1,SLIP AND SLIDE,"The item description, made me feel that these would work with my melted candy. These were terrible, thank goodness I had another brand of sticks in my cake decorating kit."
5,"A very thorough and usable dictionary, with grammar section.","After looking over the unseemly number of spanish/english dictionaries that are out there, I finally decided to go with the Harper Collins Concise Spanish, and ever since I've been very happy with my choice.As is the case with all concise dictionaries, you're making certain tradeoffs when it comes to word inclusion, but compared to the competition at this size range, the selection seems very thorough. An additional (and not too common) feature is the fairly comprehensive (300 page) grammar section at the back of the book.The print & graphic presentation are both well thought out, & result in a dictionary that is easy to consult."
2,"Frustrating, with serious flaws.","There is quite a lot to recommend this dictionary, but after using it for quite some time, I have grown to loathe it. The grammar section is actually a very positive feature; very well done and helpful even to someone who may be studying grammar formally or casually using another text. The dictionary did seem quite comprehensive at first, however there are just too many words with common definitions and usages omitted. This is true for both English and Spanish definitions. Furthermore, the dictionary is pathetically under cross-referenced, with very serious omissions in this regard indeed. I don't think this is a good investment for anyone. It's too big and combersome to be really portable and far too haphazard and unhelpful to be considered ""complete"". I think you're much better off getting a useful compact/pocket dictionary and/or a genuinely complete and comprehensive desk reference."
5,Loved it!,I really enjoyed this book. I was sorry when it came to an end. This is the type of book you will want to keep in your library to re-read over the years and to pass along to others. I definitely recommend it.
4,Quick & Easy,"I've had this item for about 4 years and just bought one for my brother after visiting him and trying to use his very dull knives.Overall it works very well. If you are good with a stone, you can get a better edge, but for 95% of your cutting the edge on this knife sharpener works very well. I also like it better than some of the electric sharpeners. The electric devices can really chew up your knife if you aren't careful.The trick to getting a good edge with this device is to follow the instructions. I know this sounds obvious but I had this thing for several years and didn't quite use it correctly. I found a couple of videos on YouTube that showed the correct way to use this sharpener.Here is one that looks reasonable -> [...]"
2,Does not sharpen very well,It just does not seem to sharpen my kitchen knives as well as others have found. My knives do not get as sharp as they originally were when first bought. Not even close.
1,Not so great,I am disappointed that this sharpener does not work as well as I had hoped. Tried on a number of knives and the result would not slice paper or tomato.Maybe I got a bad one!
3,interesting,"this rare pieces by milhaud may not be of his best, but still very interesting and pretty rare, like his ronsard settings."
3,Quotidian,"This is a disappointment, especially in the light of its enthusiastic critical reception on both sides of the pond. It is cautious, careful, circumspect, earnest, responsible and dull. There is no sign here that Beethoven is dealing out bold strokes. Instead the composer comes off as plain and palatable. And that we know he was not. Fine sound of an exceptional instrument: wasted. Increasingly I find myself turning to pianists of the past for Beethoven, though Kuerti and Goode are still with us and are well worth our attention.-Frank W. Barham"
1,Outdoor tetherball,"I DO NOT recommend anyone buy this tetherball at all!!!! It is very cheaply made and doesn't come with the instructions. I have emailed the company 4 times and heard back twice in 2 weeks. The top of the pole is very flimsy, and it is very cheap made. I would give 0 stars, but it doesn't have that option!"
2,Tetherball for the kids,"I loved playing tetherball as a kid, it was great fun to play again. This product would be better if it were actually made like the ones we played with as kids, since it's not a solid pipe, it did okay for a season. The base that goes it the ground as an anchor was easily bent, which didn't make me too happy. It should be cemented into the ground, rather than pounded in."
3,Was not a fav of mine!,"I usually collect from this name, but Goskicthen Global Gathering didn't lead up to anything good. Was disapointed and only slightly impressed with CD 2, which had more trance stuff. Overall, I would skip this in general and buy something else."
1,The Sango Saga Continues...,Received this item with one of the four containers broken. Returned immediately and as directed requesting a replacement order - that was over a month ago - still waiting to see if these canisters meet the same fate as the Hostess set that I will never be able to get. Very unsatisfied with this transaction as well.
4,Good continuity from method book #1,"I am teaching myself how to play the saxophone and found that this book coupled with method book #1 very helpful. Once again, I really appreciate the fingering chart which is one of the more readily understandable ones I've seen. I like how the book progressively teaches one note at a time to reinforce learning. I just ordered the Supplement Song Book to complete my beginner/intermediate library."
5,A love story with some twists and some 'what-ifs',"Incorporating the 'time travel concept', two ham radio students (boy/girl, of course) talk to each other on their ham radios, only to discover they're from different times. They discover they go/have gone to the same school and gradually develop a love interest. There are many other factors such as the respective male/female friends each have in their own present time. As the story evolves, we see most of the main characters are linked with each other, regardless of 'time-displacement'. To paraphrase another reviewer, the ending is beautiful, poignant and powerful."
4,Gimme a 4.9!,"Oh my gosh. I've never been on the edge of my seat ever before from watching a movie. In Ditto, I was just so focused, I didn't want anyone to disrupt my viewing. Ditto was very moving and sweet. Soeun (main girl) is so purrrdy (Her smile's the best). I only wished that somewhere toward the end, the 2 main characters would've somehow met magically (like how the HAM radio 'magically' worked unplugged) and lived happily ever after or when IN (the guy) passed by Soeun at the university in 2000, that there would've been even more than the deep stares. Actually the staring was kind of romantic, yet bitter-sweet. I think if would've been sooo interesting if IN would've starting speaking as if to the HAM right when Soeun passed him by... ""CQ..CQ..CQ.. do you copy?"" And then she stop... eyes widen, turn and tear up! VOILA, no more single Professor Yoon! OOther than that, a respective 4.9. [More films like this baby!]"
4,not enough talking,"I liked the concept and story (and the actress is pretty), but I felt like not enough stuff happened. Worse than that, stuff kept almost happening and then didn't. Mainly people who should talk to each other would just kind of look at each other awkwardly and then pass by. I especially wanted the main characters to talk to each other at the end...arrrgh! All in all though, a nice film. I thought the ending was fairly bitersweet though, unlike some previous reviewers."
5,Poignant story in present day Philadelphia,"This was an excellent read. The intertwining of one family's memory with its modern day result made for fascinated page flipping. The characters moved me to tears in several places. The subtle (and not-so-subtle) clues on life as a Jewish man got me thinking. Sometimes in life things HAVE to be done, because you are a brother, a father, a family member... a responsible man. A lovely story on many levels, READ IT. You won't be sorry."
3,Starts off Strong,"I really loved the characters and premise, but I kept waiting for the payoff that never came. All the conflicts were resolved too easily and cleanly. A nice first novel, but I wanted more."
1,ABC Family Movie????,"Sat down to what I thought was going to be fun girl night with my 8 year old daughter. First 20 minutes have two guys drinking beer, then they decide to go to a Princess Ball even after talking about how ""gay"" it would be. Then they talk about someone being a lesbian. We were about to turn it off but gave it a few more minutes and this horrible creature shows up at the end of the driveway that belongs in a horror movie. My 8 year old is almost crying telling me to shut it off. Really? Why would this be marketed to kids?"
3,disappointed,"As a mother of 4, with 3 girls under 10, I thought this would be a cute movie to watch together. I previewed it with my ten year old and was disappointed that the words ""gay"" ""lesbian"" and ""virginal princess"" were used by the ""30 something"" father - to - be in the movie, when trying to set up his friend with the princess. The words were used quickly and I'm sure younger children wouldn't pick up those words, but unfortunately my 10 year old did. I was disappointed that abc family included them in their movie. They weren't necessary and wouldn't have changed the storyline at all. I also didn't see a rating on this movie but I would certainly slap on a PG maybe even PG-13 label, for the few inappropriate words used and a few scary parts with a 5 headed ""Loch Ness"" type creature. Again, parents you preview it first and decide for yourself. Aside from those disappointments, the movie was okay."
1,Trash,"This movie was completely inappropriate for kids and way too stupid for adults. If it is for children, than they need to cut the adult ""humor""."
4,Great Product. Absorbent & doesn't leak.,"Very absorbent. However, shipping takes a good week or so is the only drawback - if you need it fast."
2,What I expected.,This product is just what I expected. The pads are larger compared to most brand training pads for puppies. Can also be used for toddlers as well to prevent bed wetting. Not cheap but they work.
5,Tempted to buy!,Everything was great until checkout. The shipping was equal to the price of the item. I would buy if that was not the case.
3,Good Deal,"Cheaper than I can find elsewhere. Pad are good for only one use from a tiny little dog as the urine spreads quickly. Still, a bargain for the price. Will purchase these again."
2,inferior quality,"The pads are of inferior quality; they do not hold urine and leak onto the floor. Nowhere does the add state they need to be used with the holder, so I was very disappointed. I buy a better quality pad at the pet store."
3,Great Buy!!!,"It was a great buy, but it is advertised as wee wee housebraking training pads, but they actually are diapers for adults, they do not have the hormone (sent) that other PET wee wee pads have."
2,Cheapo,"Much less padding, so much less absorbancy. And they aren't 23x36, they're about 22x34, though it's hard to be sure because the size isn't very consistent from one pad to another. Really cheapo construction."
4,Wee-Wee pad's for our two small dog's,These pads keep our garage much fresher & sanitary We formerly used newspaper's for our two small dog's There is no comparison The pad's are great
1,Not one of her best works....,"I don't know what to say... except that it is a silly story. I don't want to be a wet blanket but in short, how can a girl not know the VOICE a man whom she's slept with? The hero, Viscount Ravenhurst slept with her for one night... and then she hates him like hell... but surprisingly she can easily fall into the arms of a ship captain (when she was made temporarily blind) just like that! And the ship captain turns out to be - guess who - in disguise! Funny story... Can we have more credible romance stories??"
1,Save your money for a GOOD READ instead,"Not a love story in my opinion. This story was beyond silly and I don't like verbally abusive relationships with a little rape thrown in.I got sick and tired of his 'Lapis eyes' mentioned hundreds of times in this book. Don't waste your time and if you have to try it because of some of the 5 star ratings you have seen here, get it at the Library, that way when you finally throw it across the room... you are not out any money!"
1,I finished it and then threw it in the trash!,"I have been reading romance for approx. the last 10 years and if this had been the first romance novel I read, I can honestly say I don't know as though I would read another.How many cliches and awful situations can 2 people encounter? The writing was good, but could not make up for the plentiful plot holes and rushed ending. I actually did finish this book wondering how it could get any worse. By the end, I was laughing because it did!Don't get me wrong, there were a few good parts--and I have like everything else I have read by Christina Skye (which is why I tried this one), but I would definitely pick up something else!..."
1,duplicate books,"Anyone who has Boxed Set #1 should be aware that 3 of the paper-back books included in Boxed Set #2 are the same books. Therefore, you will be getting only one book that you do not already have. I believe that Amazon should include a list of the books with each boxed set."
1,Metro-rave,"This is probably one of the most disappointing albums I have ever bought!Davey's voice is fine but the music and lyrics are sooo over-the-top cheesey, ex) ""I...want...I want you."" UGH!!"
2,Davey Havok What Happened to You Review,"CD was in fine shape. Wasn't expecting too much from Cexcells and what do you know. Still, cool to see Davey and Jade still pluggin' away at new things. The basic product though, yeah, great shape. No complaints whatsoever for user or anything. Just wish..this music wasn't strange."
2,CexCells,"Meh...is the only fesable sound I can use to describe this album. Two 'hardcore' punks trying to make an album of synth pop to rival Depesh Mode's greatest work. That clearly didn't work out. Davey Havok doesn't succeed with this style of music. While his voice works perfect his style and lyrics fail. Jade Pudget, well as a guitarst he is decent, but as a producer/engineer, he is not qualified.'Stiff Kittens' 'On A Friday' 'Semiotic Love' and 'Again, Again, and Again' are the only worth while tracks on the entire album. Sex may sell but this doesn't."
2,bland,"If you like the emotion and urgency of davey havoks usual vocals, then you'll be dissappointed with this release. i love davey and jade(seriously, they have restraining orders), but this disc seemed uninspired. it's like dance music you sit down to listen to. i cant wait for the next AFI release."
3,"good, but not graham's best work","yes, this book is worth owning; its focus on fixed and preferred securities is detailed and thorough, but may be a bit too much for equity investors. however, the book does appear dated as it is given its focus on railroad and utility securities. its practical wisdom is obscured by detail on topics no longer relevant in today's day & age---""intelligent investor"" is much more timeless in this regard, and is the preferred graham book if you're only getting one.but no serious investor should be w/o this in his/ her library."
5,Excellent value,"There's some dross here, e.g. Patience & Prudence, but this is a for the most part excellent selection of material supplied, at least to the best of my knowledge, in the original singles versions as recorded by the original artists. At the price it's an excellent value."
4,I Loved Baby One More Time but Hated Autumn Goodbye,"After I bought the single Baby One More Time, I listened to it continuosly. It has a great beat and fun lyrics that you can sing with. It also makes you wanna get up and move around and dance. But Autumn Goodbye is terrible and very girly. It sounds a lot like Barbie Girl but much worse with poor lyrics and annoying singing."
5,Sure to be a success!,"When I first listened to the song ""Baby One More Time"" I loved it and I had to get CD single. The song has very catchy rythms and I am glad it finally went gold. Even though her album isn't due until January 99, I think it will be a huge success. I definatly recomend her music to all *N SYNC fans."
4,OK. I added an extra star since it's not goin to her head.,"The song is pretty good, she's good-looking, and she has a nice voice. she's got it all going for her. i liked the song. but after you listen to it alot you start to get tired of. plus if you listen to it a lot you'll relize all the lyrics are the same through the whole song. it gets kinda boring. but she is on her way to the top, and the songs pretty good (the lyrics are only ok) and i liked the music.. and since she's so young, and probably not letting this go to her head, this is shure to be #1 on some list. i liked it."
3,catchy tune great beat for dancing,"The former Mickey Mouse Club member has made a come back with this oh-so-catchy debut single. However the single's second track, Autumn Goodbye, is somewhat of a different beat from the energy packed Baby One More Time. A pretty good start, Britney. Only one little warning to the listners, Don't overdose on the soda pop of this single or the the song might turn slightly ""flat""."
4,Great Body; Great Talent,"This girl is amazing!!! She is only 17 and she is so good at singing. I mean, i listen to her cd everday and it never gets old. This cd single is the best single that i have ever bought."
5,Britney's the BEST!,"BRITTNEY'S THE BEST SINGER IN THE WORLD AND I WANT TO BE AS GOOD OF SINGER AS SHE IS ONE DAY.I HAVE HER C.D. AND IT'S THE BEST! * TO ANYONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW: LISTEN TO THE VERY LAST SONG BUT DON'T JUST TURN IT OFF RIGHT THEN. THERE IS A FEW BACKSTREET BOYS ( NEW ALBUM ) SONGS THAT ARE HIDDEN AT THE END. ALL THE SONGS ARE AWSOME AND TO ANYONE WHO DOESN'T THINK SO, WELL THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM! I LOVE BRITNEY SPEARS, SHE'S SO PRETTY AND SUCH A GOOD SINGER! BYE!FROM BRITNEY'S #1 FAN,CAITLIN"
2,i would not recommed this ablum.,britney spears is really a talented singer but the songs on this album are not good for her. baby one more time is a great song and really shows her talents off the the rest of the album really didn't live up to all the fuss everyone has been making about it. if i was britney the next album i put out i would chose the songs that let me express my talent instead of getting on peoples nerves.
4,indecisive,"I'm not sure how much I like this song. I Know I like it, but too many listens makes it get on your nerves. I guess it's pretty good, but it isn't extremely wonderful. It's worth getting the single though. Oh, and the video definitley gets points. The school girl outfit--the dance moves. 2 thumbs up!"
3,"Catchy tune, but...","When this song came out, I refused to admit that I liked it. It was just another Spice Girlish bubble gum pop kind of song. But as I heard it more and more, I couldn't help singing along! It's an incredibly catchy tune and it's really hard NOT to sing along. But, on the other hand, when I actually listened to the words I was singing, I was pretty disgusted. The whole song is just about her wanting to be with a boyfriend and how she is completely onely and refuses to have any fun without him! That's pretty yucky. In her music video, and on the cover of her CDs, etc, it's perfectly obvious that she's totally made-up with tons of makeup and airbrushed by computers and all that stuff. It's not natural at all! In my opinion, Britney Spears is right up there along with the Spice Girls in a list of role models that girls should definitely NOT look up to."
5,Terrific Pop song,"This song is what good Pop Music is all about. Its fresh, contagious and fun, I can't wait to hear what's next from Britney Spears."
5,Whatever to anything below 5 stars!,"...She is a really cool singer if you just give her a chance. Message to Britney: I... have wanted to be a singer all my life. Ever since I started listening to your songs, I knew exactly what kind of singer I wanted to be. Britney is da bomb!"
5,Great song!,I just really loved this song! I think Britney has a great talent in singing and a beautiful voice. I am planning on buying the whole CD later. I think that Autumn Goodbye is a really good song. Good job Britney!
4,Catchy and well...cool!,"I've only listened to this song about 10 times and I think it is one of the best songs of the time. Like some poeple have said, she's ""hot""."
1,EW DONT BUY THIS CD SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Ok, yes i admit it. I liked ""Baby One More Time"" when i heard it at first. But after hearing it about a million times it got very old. I was over at my friends who had bought this cd and it was horrible. With cheezy songs and a bad voice, Britney Spears has made a CD that is much worse than you would expect. She cant sing! SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Shallow and Trashy,"It has been said that the purpose of art is to say something. When well done art can say something wonderfully and beautifully, Spears single does neither. It says nothing and is in no way beautiful, how can something that sounds like a teeny bopper with beans lodged in her nasal cavity whining and pleading for someone to hit her one more time. Don't waste your time money or eardrums."
3,"Catchy, but something's a little off.","The beat and tunes are catchy, but no offense, I just don't quite dig the broken-guitar voice."
5,Easy to dance to!,I am a HUGE music fan and this is my favorite album of all time! Britney Spears is my favorite singer and I want to be just like her. When I first listened to her song I was some where where I couldn't dance and I was just about to burst out and do it!
3,Too many gory cases,"This casebook contains too many cases involving objectionable subject matter (e.g., child sexual abuse). Illustrative cases with less shocking content could be found. My daughter is very curious about my studies and would love to read my books, but I had to keep this one out of reach."
2,Guitar Electronics for Musicians,"Was disappointed with this book. The guitar electronics theory was fine but the illustrations, photos, and wiring diagrams were not that great. The photos are in black and white and look as though they were from a '60's text book. The diagrams actually look better than the photos.Parts of this book seem to be a compilation of manufacturers' wiring diagrams and manuals, most of which didn't apply to any of my needs.If you're into guitar electronic theory, this is the book for you. However, you may do better with the Dan Earlewine or the Dave Burrlick books."
2,Not a very useful book,"This volume, which has been around unchanged for at least 25 years, has a little useful theory and some diagrams of factory guitar wiring, most of which have fallen into obscurity as people keep going back to Strat, Tele, Les Paul styles. It is not terribly well written and while the most popular classic circuits are there, you can get those everywhere, including online for free.If you want to learn to configure electric guitars to achieve goals you want, there are better choices, such as Adrian Legg's book, although it is more a list of things Legg has done rather than a thorough theory book. If you want to have easy access to useful documentation for service purposes, several volumes of wiring diagrams are available from Stewart-McDonald and other guitar vendors. Either way, this book isn't what you want. It should have been retired two decades ago."
2,so outdated it should be out of print,"This book doesn't even mention active pickups or noisefree single-coil pickups. It lists about 20 major manufacturers, of which I'd only heard about maybe 5 of them, and then I'm a gear head. Of course basic electronic principles haven't changed since this book was written but come on. I generally don't agree with folks who say ""you can get all this information on the internet"" because there's a value in having everything carefully preselected and gathered in one place, but this book is so dated I would recommend people to use google instead. I regret buying this."
3,I would look elsewhere,"This has some good GENERAL, but dated, information. I have been unable to find a good electronics book for guitars. If i had been able to read it first i probably would not have bought it. I think my next stop is a basic electricity book."
5,great book,"this is a great book,it was very helpfull.watch that is a little old(1983),but it's ok,I repeat,very helpfull"
4,Electronics for players,Good vintage explanations and decent photos and drawings. Not many actual wiring diagrams or illustrations show how to hook up the gear. But i found this a useful book. Thanks
2,Find another book,"Outdated and has very little helpful information. Keep looking. There are better books out there. I still refer to it once in a while, but frankly I have more luck on the internet."
5,Lo maximo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Yo digo que este es el MEJOR LIBRO DE ELECTRONICA DE LA GUITARRA HASTA LA FECHA!!! no ha salido nada mejorrr.es cierto que necesita actualizaciones cierto que las fotos son malaslos wirings diagrams son no malos sino pesimos!!! y todo lo demas negativo que tiene este libro, peroooooo!!aun asi!!! este es el mejor libro disponible en el mercado sobre este tema.nota:no es para principiantes okkk??"
3,Needs to be updated!,"This book may have been cutting edge when it was first published but it needs to be scrapped and updated. Too much info about Shecter pickups and stuff nobody uses anymore. Some good information about how the electronics work, pots, switches pickups etc. Modern guitars have piezos, midi pickups. There was a brief mention of piezos but nothing on midi. There are lots of new pickups on the market and these are discussed either. Still, I found the book informative just not current."
2,"The best book available on guitar electronics, twenty years ago","Now there's just very little point. There's nothing in here that you can't find with a quick internet search. There are a number of books, and book types, that have become irrelevant with the net. This is one of them."
3,"old ""skool"" kung fu","I had the opportunity to view this flick in it's entirety,,,,well, let's just say a 3 star would suffice. Accordingly. This flick had the potential to be an amazing old school kung fu flick, in the 5 star category!! There is a great story to tell, but in a very confusing way. The fight scenes were awesome, but most of them were at nights,,therefore, you can't really see what's happening, so you're forced to use your imagination. The camera angles were grossly inconsistent with what's really going on. There is no question the fights that you are able to see clearly, are un-matched!! An amazing old school kung fu flick, with a good but confusing story. However, what killed this one for me,,it was poorly choreographed,,which is really sad!!!"
5,Absolutely Amazing Book for anyone who's trying to master any skill,"This small book is a hidden gem. It's sad it hasn't been more widely read and reviewed by people. I'll gladly write the first review.In the book, Dr. Dimon explains very clearly and convincingly how our mind and body systematically work in learning and mastering any new skill. I have seen many books on exploring the issue but never seen anything more comprehensive yet so simple. That is the beauty of Dr. Dimon's approach. It's right to the point and everything makes so much sense and actually works. Anybody who is trying to learn a skill like how to play instrument or how to play a sports or anything really can use this book to better understand how it can be done. This books gives whole new perspective and it's a truly eye opening experience."
2,Old. Outdated. Fairly Useless,"This is an old version, with some mistakes, bad rounding, and just inaccurate data. Not to mention that there is an entire section of the exam not covered by this book."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"This is probably easily the worst of the Ludlum books. The ghostwriter here didn't do a good enough job to make this one too interesting. It is another example of the ordinary man type, although the ordinary man in question was a spy in the World War Two era on a part time basis, and now is a diplomat.The plot is centred around Russian politics."
3,Too much luck for one guy,"Metcalfe, the young spy in this book had too much luck on his side to remain believable throughout the book. Some characters are disappointing, others are quite good though. Like the violin playing SD agent. If you like WWII thrillers it is a nice book to read. Otherwise forget about it."
5,Even better than Sigma Protocol!,"I'm a huge Ludlum fan, and at first I expected to be disappointed when I realized that the plot is set partly in WWII. But I was pleasantly surprised -- the action and excitement are just as heart-pounding as in SIGMA PROTOCOL, if not more so! (SIGMA is my favorite Ludlum -- if you haven't read it, do it now!) I must disagree with the other reviewers about this book."
3,The Tristan Betrayal,"I thought this that the first half of the book was written by Ludlum and the second half by someone else. Someone who did not write nearly as well as Ludlum. The italics, the exclamation points, the weakness that the main character displayed, was NOT what the original author intended. If there are any more Ludlum books out there and need either editing or finishing, please find someone who is capable of measuring up the talent of the original author."
3,Almost to the Authors standards,"This, as most of Ludlum's books, is a page-turner. The first third of the book is well written, exciting and engaging. Though you still want to follow our spy, Metcalfe, to the end of the book, though it slows down a little in believability and excitement. Though there is still minor twist that I enjoyed because there are clues given before hand for you to figure it out before it is revealed.The book starts with Metcalfe in his old age being summoned to 1991 Russia to help with interior turmoil. With that we flash back to where we can see him in action in NAZI occupied Europe. We see him operate in Paris, Moscow and Berlin. This is not his best book, but it is still worth reading."
1,Unbelievable,The principal character would have to be superman to survive the situations in which the author placed him.The plot was without any basis in fact and insulted the intelligence of the reader and the hero's enemies.
2,So very dull,"It would be a terrible shame if Robert Ludlum was to be remembered for books like this, rather then some of the great thrillers he has written over the years. This story has been ghost written and it reads nothing like a Ludlum novel. Amazingly there is no tension or true thrills at any point of the book and you ended up not caring about the characters at all. Despite the potentially interesting background I was bored from start to finish and I had a sense of relief when I finally reached the end.The real crime here sits with the editor and the publisher who do not seem to realise what the reading public want and expect from a novel that has Ludlum's name on the cover."
3,Book Gift,"Bought this used because that's the only way it can be purchased. Gave as a gift and recipient had to accept that the dust jacket was crinkled at one corner. Description didn't articulate that detail. The recipient is a book collector and those details matter, but at least he has the book AND it was VERY inexpensive."
1,Pulp excrement cashing in on Ludlum franchise.,"First, it's ""ghost"" authored, ( if anyone would seek to claim authorship ).Second, it's unreadable. Someone or some team of marmosetts let loose in a room with word processors is obviously trying to 'create' a book in the Ludlum idiom but fail and preposertously so.Finally - it's so bad, just so wretchedly awful, a tedious, boring, trite, stupendously reeking piece of monkey poo. Fling it away."
5,Thrilling,Did't want to put it down. So many twists and turns. Never know who the good guys and the bad guys are. Great ending. Highly recomend this novel.
2,It's time to let go,"Robert Ludlum must be rolling over in his grave. I used to devour Ludlum novels in one sitting. I am having trouble finishing this one -- far fetched, poorly contstructed, full of cliches. It's as if someone read all of his previous works and pulled the absolute worst parts from each and put them into one book. I am through -- this is the last Ludlum I will waste my time and money on. He was a master of the genre -- let his readers remember him as such"
2,"Lost steam, unbelievable","I just finished this book a few days ago. What a disappointment. I thought that since it had the great name Ludlum on it, it would be better. How wrong I was.I agree with the reviewer who said it lost steam after about 150 pages. It started out great, and I was really enjoying it as the tension built up. But then something happened midway through where it just became unbelievable. The main character, Metcalfe (who is supposed to be only 29 but acts way older at times) will be in a hot spot, unable to get out, and lo-and-behold, somebody would come along just in time to rescue him, or he'd happen upon just the right tool to help him out of the job. In the end, everything fell together just too easily, and it was too cliche the way the ""bad guy"" spent several pages explaining what he did, the whole time threatening to kill the hero. I just can't recommend this book."
4,Truly Soulful,"In the past few years, I really haven't heard a whole lot when it comes to soulful music. It has been more hip hop and rap oriented with acts that are more about gloss like Beyonce', and Ciara. For somebody like Musiq Soulchild, he definitely had to find his way back into the industry after a few years away. His latest single, Buddy, from Luvanmusiq is really a delightful song. I like this a lot because it very soulful and down to Earth. It is his best song since Don't Change back in 2002. If you haven't heard his style and his voice, this is the song to listen to. It is a very good song.Song: B"
2,Poorly organized and illustrated.,"The first thing that struck me about this book was the way it is organized. It attempts to guide the reader through a full year of qigong practice, starting in spring. While this idea is, in itself, not a bad one, the increased intensity of the exercises inhibits the ability to begin practice at any other time. In other words, if your bought this book in January, as I did, you'd be starting at ""month 11,"" which is almost at the end of the book and assumes knowledge of the previous 10 months. So, unless you begin practice in March of April, the book is nearly useless until then.Even if the qigong exercises in this book were accurate and beneficial, you'd never know it. The sparse illustrations only show one of the three to eight steps in each exercise and the written descriptions of each step is often unclear. An introduction to qigong should be more accessible to the beginner."
4,a little disjointed but good overall,"The first half of the book was reminiscent of the Collapsium, the second half read a more like the lord of the rings. It takes a few unbelievable turns but overall is a worthy followup to the Collapsium. If you start the wellstone and don't like you can skip to this book and still follow."
3,interest for some,Caged woman is better that women prison massacre. Unfortunately I think the director thought he was making a serious film. There is a lot of dialogue between the ... scenes. Emmanuelle however does get naked when she is molested by the general. on the whole watchable but not a classic.
4,Beautiful,"I first heard Die Laughing on the Gothic Rock 2 compilation, about 3 1/2 years ago, and found this disc in a local record shop about 6 months ago. Bought it right away. The first two tracks, 'Firedance' and 'Glamour and Suicide', are the ones that stand out most in my mind. The rest of the CD is great. I was, however, a little disappointed with 'Safe Little World' I found the demo version (from Gothic Rock 2) to be much better."
2,Tony,"I have a software on my computer that I could not uninstall. I purchase the Uninstaller software,it could not uninstall it either. I am going to give Ideasoft the benefit of the doubt and say somthing must be wrong with my computer.So I uninstall the uninstaller.I could not honestly give it a rating."
3,Note - the volumes have been renumbered,"This is a classic set of books, and greatly improved from the original version. But if you're looking for the old Volume 1, this book will disappoint. The second edition of Winning Ways is split into 4 separately published books. So THIS Volume 1 is just half of the old Volume 1. Be prepared."
2,an amalgamation of nonsense?,"I tried reading this book, but honestly it was pretty nonsensical. There is too much breadth at the expense of depth. It feels like every game is just glossed over and the structure of the book varies greatly and every game seems to handled differently. I was reading this book to learn about combinatorial game theory, but I feel as if I got nothing substantial out of reading this book. I was looking for a textbook style learning material, but this felt more like a brochure about math games"
3,Good helper,This book has a lot of little puppet skits inside. It helps during Sunday School and using the information to assist with the lessons.
2,Extremely Disappointing,"Save your money.What happened to the hits ""Girl Don't Come"" AND ""Long Live Love""?"
3,"Great, but Missing a Track!","This is a great collection of remastered Sandie Shaw tracks. However, it does not contain one of her best known hits, and that happens to be ""Long Live Love"". I am not exactly sure what the producers were thinking when this collection was put together. However, it is well worth every penny! The ""Very Best of Sandie Shaw"" does contain the missing track."
5,this is the best in modern praise & worship ever.,"This must be the best i've heard in praise & worship in a long time. It's fresh, innovative and full of the annointing of the Holy Spirit. This is a must in every home.Great work Carman!!!"
4,exciting and exploding with favor,once again comtemporary musician carman shows us why his passion for praise is so strong and why is one the best artist in the business
1,Tia Britani's Review,"This is Tia's Revieww about Carman's CD: Passion for Praise It really touch my heart By the Gosple Of Jesus Christ! I'm really touch my Heart Carman is doing a Wonderful Job changeing Peole lives though the Gosple Of Jesus Christ!

2,Not coffee,Doesn't taste like coffee to me. Has a nasty after-taste. I will stick to good old Starbucks or Peete's coffee. Thank you!
1,Would not recommend... Customer Service NOT GOOD,While the product DID arrive in a timely fashion and was packed well I had an issue of *computer compatibility!* My problem was with the Customer Service or *lack of* that I received. My problem was later resolved by Amazon.com themselves and NOT the seller. I would not buy from this seller again. To me... Customer Service IS more important than anything else in a purchase.
3,Could be better,"Enjoyable footage of Kilimanjaro and the climb up. The IMAX format and story isn't as detailed as a Kilimanjaro documentary might be. Though the DVD said TRT (total running time) is 70 minutes, the actual feature ran to just under 40 minutes. So, disappointing in this regard. I got the sense of the mountain - as IMAX would portray - just not the real-world expedition climbing of it: preparation, packing, porters, cooks, others on the mountain etc. A good first look at the mountain, but it left many questions unanswered in preparing for a Kili climb."
2,"Nice Scenery, but a disappointment","I was expecting a lot more from this film. Besides some spectacular views of the mountain, it left me feeling empty and wanting more. I was hoping for more actual information about climbing Kili and what it was really like and I was disappointed when there was little or none. Despite their words saying how hard it was, the film did not capture the feeling of how challenging it is. I came across as little more than a simple hike. Pretty pictures but lacking substance. Breashears' Everest is significantly better and more interesting."
2,"Interesting, but not worth the time...","The film was very inspiring, yet the interviews of the climbers sounded like they were reading from a script. They also tried to make the climb look harder that it was... a 12 year old girl climbed the mountain, and the narrator continued to say how difficult the journey was. The entire film builds up to an un-eventful climax. The best part was the first 5 mins. when they showed the shots of the african animals and zebras. Overall a flop."
4,Making Out In Thai,"This book is very handy in getting a smile from Thai's.The ladies appreciate that you try to speak the language!I wouldn't reccommend this for a person seriously attempting to learn the language...afterall it is not a coursebook, but it is a good supplemental to have. This is a great communication starter and will teach you some interesting things to help during a vacation (nightlife, foods, shopping, etc.) This book can help you learn those words that most liberal coursebooks see as Taboo. Overall a decent book. Glad I bought it."
3,Decent -Fast Food Thai,"I actually found this book useful for learning quick Thai. The phrases and words in the book were current with everyday situations that a foreigner would encounter if he or she was staying longer than the typical tourist holiday in Thailand. Thai people actually thought I was proficient and fluid with the language even though I only know 30 words and phrases. There are no references to tones but I think the author does not want the reader to get hung up on the correct tonal pronounciation,just learn the words. The local people will correct your pronunciation trust me! I was fortunate because I speak a little Mandarin therefore the tones are not much of a problem for me. The book is great if you want to learn useful Thai on your flight over to the Thailand. Unlike other phrase books you are not burdened with phrases like ""The tree is tall"" instead you know how ask someone on a date or tell them that you are not a dumb tourist."
3,Needs Tone marks,"i don't own this book, but i looked thru it in a book store, and one thing ticked me off: It doesn't have tone marks.Thai has 5 tones, different tones give the same syllabyl a different meaning. This book uses no such method for denoting tones of words, so unless you already speak Thai, it might be hard to have other Thai-speakers understand you."
3,Ann's opinion,"I am an unabashedly enthusiastic admirer of Renee Fleming's work but was very disappointed in this DVD. The sound seemed tailored to the orchestra - and what an orchestra at that! I've not heard a better rendition of Tchaikovsy's Romeo and Juliet in 50 years of concert going. However, Renee's singing came across as kind of 'muted'. I'd heard all the selections before of course but she sounded, and at times looked, quite apprehensive; although ravishing as usual in some gorgeous dresses. As other reviewers have suggested it may have been a technical problem and the fault of sound engineers. All in all, a very frustrating and disappointing concert. Not that it would stop me buying any other of hers!"
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased the video for my grandson, a beginning golfer. I thought the video of little value regarding teaching a starter how to play golf. Yes, there were a few items regarding etique, but not what I was looking for."
3,Would probably be better for older kids..,"i bought this dvd for my 2 year old son who absolutely loves golf (and he's fantastic at it!) and i thought it was a good instructional dvd, but it didn't keep his attention. i think it'd b good for kids around 5 or 6"
5,HARDCORE FOR REAL,"THIS IS WHAT I CALL GETTING THE MOST FOR YOURMONEY!! IT'S A FULL LENGHT ""AXE TO YOUR FOREHEAD""FRIGHTENINGLY POWERFUL ALBUM.YOU JUST CAN'TGET ENOUGH.AT THE VERY FIrST BLAST OF CHORDSYOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LISTEN EACHALBUM[YES 3 OF EM PLUS SINGLES!!!!] SEPARATELY.JUST NOT THE CASE.THE WHOLE 79 MINUTES GO BY AND YOU ARE THERE,FROZEN IN FRONT OR THE SPEAKERSOR SPLATTERED AGAINST THE WALL,WHICHEVER TYPEOF PERSON YOU ARE.THIS IS THE BEST HARDCOREALBUM EVER RECORDED AND IT EVEN SOUNDS BETTER THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT FOR AN 80's RECORDING.THIS HAS GOT TO BE A VERY UNDERATED HCALBUM OR THEY WOULD'T BE SELLING IT SO CHEAP.THIS IS PURE SONIC TERRORISM.I BOUGHT IT FORTHE LOW PRICE AND WEIRD NAME,DID I MENTIONDUTCH TOO? IT'S A BLAST,I HAD'NT HEARD ANYTHINGTHIS POWERFUL AND ENERGETIC SINCE BLACK FLAG.IF YOU DON'T BUY THIS ONE YOU WILL NEVER R.I.P.AFTER DEATH,PERIOD !!!!!!!!!!!"
3,So-So video quality of a legendary band.,"This is two shows in so-so video quality, much like a home made bootleg.I'd give the video 5/6 out of 10.As I understand the band does not receive any money from the sale of this dvd.So my rating goesChameleons *****Performance ****Video quality ***Ripping off the band *"
1,Reviews written by ringers,"The phony ""5 Star"" reviews all reference the ""usefulness to academics"" angle of this book, suspiciously the same lingo used by the book's publicist. The one ""0 Star"" review is by a real Internet marketer. I too am a real Internet marketer and I can tell you I am *not* interested in theory, I am interested in results. I agree with the previous reviewer that Declan Dunn or Shawn Collins would indeed be far more useful. I also enjoyed the comment by the ""student"" who says he does not usually buy expensive books. Gee, when I was a student, that's all I did was buy expensive books - where do you go to school? Save your money on this one, folks."
5,Most interesting,I have read about women secretly serving in the Civil War but not about a woman posing as a male in a manor house. Most interesting.
3,Albert Nobbs,"The movie was okay. I thought that it dragged at times, but Glen Close is definitely a good actress with this controversial topic"
2,This DVD...,I have gotten four copies of this DVD...one from Amazon and four from blockbuster and none of them go past Chapter 1. I have to write Lionsgate when I get a chance.
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"Waste of money... only chose to buy it upon recommendations by ""Entertainment"" channels. blah blah blah blah... wish I hadn't spent the money. would like to get rid of it!"
1,Albert Nobbs,Did not like it and thought it was dragged on and boring. I love her acting but this movie wasn't her best.
2,Silly Mess,"The movie waa a perfect waste of money and time. It is a gay movie i guess. I'm really not sure exactly what it was. But, I'm sure it wasn't for me."
2,What a waste of talent,"The only good thing about this movie was the exceptional talent of the actors/actresses. This movie is so sadly the most gender/sexually confused thing I have ever seen.Albert Nobbs was gang raped as a young teenager then goes on to live out her life as a man...out of fear and need to earn a living. Albert does not appear to be in any need of sex, yet everyone around him is oversexed....Helen/Joe, Hubert/Kathleen, the Innkeeper and the Maid, the two men and their wives with ""adjoining rooms"".What a waste of talent on such filth. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the acting was exceptional!"
3,Disappointed--but Close is great,This movie got a lot of hype since Glenn Close was nominated for the Academy Award for her performance but I was a little disappointed in the movie.
2,Not A Complete Achievment,"Firstly, hat tip to Glenn Close for her dedications to this charactor/story and finally made the film and earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination. She also seeked out the able hands of director Rodrigo Garcia who sucessfully adpated an Israeli TV series into 3 seasons of ""In Treatment"" on HBO. That being said, I can't say the film is a sucess. The main problem is Glenn Close's portral/make-up of the title charcter who fails to allow the viewers to truly feel her pain/misery with sympathy and sentiment in return."
4,Great as far as it goes...,"some questions remain unanswered: Why did Albert choose this life? What is her real name? Did the other woman's ""wife"" know she married a woman? What was Kathleen's motivation? How does Hubert plan to take care of Helen and her baby?Otherwise.... very interesting story and great acting along with excellent production design and costuming, in a very capable director's hands."
4,I'm rather conflicted but not in a bad way...,"Wow, this is an odd yet compelling movie. I loved it and yet I thought it could have been so much more. Glenn Close was amazing as Albert but I thought her performance was a little too stoic and reticent. Janet McTeer as Hubert Page turned in a stellar portrayal of a woman living as a man.I never believed Close as Albert, her facial bone structure is too womanly, her stature too small. I was however completely taken in by McTeer's performance as Hubert Page. Her stature and mannerisms were very believable until she whipped out some mighty fine looking breasts to show Albert she had no reason to fear discovery.The turn of the century costumes and scenery were fabulous, the performances overall first rate. Even though I am conflicted about this movie it really struck me somehow. I still highly recommend it and will most likely view it again.It is a sad story, ""Why do people live such miserable lives""? Poverty and loneliness usually."
5,Thought-provoking,"The characters are expertly portrayed and the plot is intriguing, if (at first glance) far-fetched. It gave me a lot of sympathy for women's plight in those days; not many acceptable choices existed, so creative alternatives were devised. Some light moments pepper this heartfelt drama. I found it very moving."
5,"""We are all disguised as ourselves.""","I've never witnessed a performance by Glenn Close that didn't blow me away. Watching her is always a privelege and, after seeing this wonderful movie in the theater, I knew I'd be buying the dvd. Now, it sits on a shelf next to ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and the first three seasons of ""Damages"". If I weren't so familiar with Ms. Close's impressive skill and versatility, I'd probably find it hard to believe that the woman who portrayed the Marquise de Merteuil and Patty Hewes is the same person who inhabits the role of Albert Nobbs, but I know very well that this particular actress can do anything. I'm so glad she was finally given the opportunity to make this movie because it's a treasure."
5,A good story,Although I have seen this story before it still was interesting to see again. A somewhat sad story but was reflective of that time period.
5,Injustice,Never really gave much thought to the injustice that was happening to women trying to make livings and how that might have placed them in different situations.
5,Schnittke Viola Concerto: tearing the soul,"This is in my opinion the best recording of the Viola Concerto despite some technical challenges - in particular some pitch issues with the viola. Yet, the energy of both soloist and orchestra carry the work's dramaturgy and leave your soul feeling like you just experienced all human emotions.The soloist and orchestra have a global vision of this work often lacking in other recordings even by Bashmet or Van Keulen that seem to juxtapose various sections without a sense of the whole.A must have.P.S. JF Laurson kindly reminded me that I am not a professional reviewer and sometimes I just write my enthusiasm without hoping these scribblings would make the Academy of letters..."
2,"Well played, but not as compelling as Bashmet","Kashkashian plays the Schnittke very well from a technical perspective, but it somehow lacks some of the intensity and emotion that Bashmet brings to his performance. Some of the nuances and her style of playing does not sound quite right to me when I hear this work. It almost comes off as obnoxious at times. (No offense to Kashkashian and her incredible technique.) Bashmet on the other hand brings a wider range of sounds and moods that I find rather lacking here.I also found that the orchestra sounds rather distant and unclear at times. The orchestra that accompanies Bashmet's RCA recording sounds very clear and many of the finer details can be heard better."
3,some can't,"Some people can't sing Burt Bacharach songs.Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, Burt Bacharach,Luther Vandros, Elvis Costello, Deacon Blue, Billy J kramer, Drifters.I dont remember Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa, not very good anyway.The rest of the songs are the hits I remember 13/22 tracks about 60%.This is why I give the album 3 stars.It would be 5 stars without the junk.Dionne Warwick can sing Backarach, that's why they had many hits.If you can, listen before you buy."
3,"Slightly plastic-y construction, but useful","No surprises here - functional and works well for my needs, storage compartments seem to be non-abrasive on the CDs. My one suggestion would be for the CD pages to be removable, so that one can rearrange/reorganize one's collection more easily. As it stands, the plastic 3 ring binder post does not open to allow pages to be removed and shuffled around."
2,Good gone Bad!,"Loved this printer when it worked. Then one day, it started to have trouble feeding, and 1 repairman later, the mother board had gone bad after only 1 year or less. The picture quality was awesome, but, the ink was expensive and ran out quickly. I'm not going to take a chance on another one this time."
5,The most important buy I ever made.,"This kind of pen is special is a collectors edition that I'll keep as it is, because is impossible to use such fine and delicate thing."
4,Great game... for the younger kids,"this is a very fun game. Great graphics, smooth gameplay, and, as i said, lots of fun! you can choose from a bunch of pros, such as arod, nomar, bonds, giambi, beltran, and sosa. and the backyard kids, like pablo sanchez, dante robinson, jocinda smith, etc.but, as my title says, it's made for the younger kind. The game gets really easy really fast, and on the hard mode with errors off, i beat the other team 44-1.I would borrow it from a friend, see how you like it, and go from there, but don't buy it right away."
5,This game is a must,"Backyard baseball teams up with Major League Baseball and The Major League Baseball Players Association to bring real-life baseball pros to the neighborhood baseball diamond...as kids! They have players from Mark McGwire to A-Rod,Ivan Rodriguez,Randy Johnson,Larry Walker,Chipper Jones,Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa,Ken Griffey Jr.,and much,much more! As well as all major league teams. And you can play people on the internet. Theres game modes like season,single game,and batting practice. Plus you not only get the game but you get baseball cards with the game and its a whole lot of fun for anyone.Enjoy!"
3,O.K.,This game is great at first but gets really boring. I hated the fact of fatigue because Pete Weeler is the fastest person and becomes the slowest. If you only have the shadow to tell you where the ball is then it's the best.If it shows you where the actual ball is then it's almost an automatic homerun even for the average player.
4,"Great Baseball, Fun Game","This game is definatly better than the first one. You can choose to play a real team, or, the always availible backyard logos. Now you can pick real players(some have retired by now though) or the talented backyard kids.When you play the easy mode, it's easy! My cousin has won 50 to 0! The medium level is a bit more challenging. You still win pretty easily, but I've got myself cought in a couple of games that are still too hard. The hard is HARD, well not too hard. The scores are now like baseball scores. Not 32 to 4, but 3 to 4 and so on.Well I think it's a great game. Ready to be played by children of all ages. Just say thanks to Humonguous, the pro players, and the backyard kids for all this fun. I also recommend Bakyard Football, Soccer, and Basketball."

4,good game,This is a fairly fun game which is meant for younger kids and not for older kids so if your 10 or up and you find it boring your above the recommended age groups so you get what you deserve. All and all its a good game and well worth your money if your in the age group.
2,A complete money waster,"I thought this game was okay when I first got it, but it just got boring after only a few weeks. Although I like sports games, this got boring way to fast. The pitchers would throw way to slow and then they give you a special throw that is almost impossible to hit. Also if you care for graphics much, don't buy this game. If you love baseball, try Triple Play 98 or 99."
5,Backyard Baseball is Cool!!!!!,I think that Backyard Baseball is cool because it works on Macintosh and not many sports games work on Macs. I like how they made pro players into kids. I also like being able to make my own players and coaches. On my first season I won the Backyard World Series. I liked the Super Collassal Dome and Big City Stadium - that's where they had the playoffs. My favorite player is Pablo Sanchez. He is probably the best backyard player. I also like that you can make your own team and team colors. This is the funnest baseball gane on earth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,2002 2500/3500 HD Owners be advised,this wont fit the 2002 2500/3500 trucks. You have to buy the ones for a 2001 if you want them to fit. I learned the hard way
3,Disappointing and flat,"I have seldom read any book with so little sense of place. This is particulary ironic since most of the book was set in Maine, certainly a picturesque state. This book is completely lacking in ""magic""--both in writing style and content. With so many books, and so little time, I say: pass on this one."
4,Read it before Oprah recommends it.,"I liked this book a lot, I really did. I wasn't sure I was going to-I usually read more ""boy"" books, but a friend told me about it and I bought it and couldn't put it down. I read it in about two days, I was so drawn into it. The characters seem to be real people, rather than people invented for the plot (I especially liked the priest) and the plot had some surprising twists. This is going to be one of those books, like The Reader, or the Patrick O'Brian books, that people like to claim to have read first. I recommend it."
4,Hamilton choke nylon collar,"Collar seems good and strong but the rings were on the small side and made it difficult to thread them together. Other than that, it's a good product."
4,"not great, but great price","well if you're releasing an album with the name ""the summer of peace, love and music, vol 2"" you'd expect something a little bit more complete, don't get me wrong the songs chosen here are great, but they could (record company) have released one whole album instead of two???, i just recently bought a box set by the name ""rockin' 70's"" which is a three cd set, now that's what they should have done with this one, like i said the music is fine, blue cheer, chamber brothers and the classic closer to home/i'm your captain by grand funk, it's just that 10 songs only??? c'mon next time, do what other record companies have done, take your time choose 30 or 40 songs that really reflect that era and release a compilation that's really worth it, like i said i bought this cd because of the price, that's the only reason, cheers!!!!!! panama dejen la corrupcion oye!!!!!!"
5,Best sandals ever!,"I'm usually the type of girl who chooses cute shoes over comfortable shoes any day, but these have completely won me over. They've become my everyday sandals, as they're the most comfortable shoes I've worn in years. I bought one pair as an impulse buy in a Clarks store, and since then I've bought 4 other colors. They're definitely a keeper."
3,Out dated,"The theories and practices are sound. However, the book is for the old analog multimeter. Still a good reference source on testing and the basics of circuitry."
3,So-So Thriller,"MacGregor's novel starts off well but loses steam as it goes along. There are too many characters, and most of them are insufficiently developed. The book also suffers from patches of cliche writing (one character's ""heart literally (?) leaped into his throat,"" a rich neighborhood ""smelled of old money,"" a person has vanished ""like the wind,"" etc.), technical errors in the description of police procedure, and lapses of continuity. (At one point we are told that a character ""couldn't make it"" to dinner, but two pages later it seems that he did make it, after all.) I know these sound like little things, and they are, but after a while they start to add up. On the positive side, the author has ambitiously woven together a variety of story elements -- near-death experiences, ESP, Alzheimer's, crime, bereavement -- in an intriguing way. The idea is good, but in my opinion the execution falls short. It still makes for a diverting read, though."
2,This book is...,"Good: A wonderful plot. The character development was fair to good. The killer's psychotic thought processes are portrayed quite vividly.Bad: DETAILS! The lack of details ruined the book! After reading books such as L. Sanders's Deadly Sin series, I had force myself through sections of this book! Just to point a few things out... Ford Explorers DO NOT have sliding doors. Digital clock registers RESET to either 00:00 or 12:00 upon interruption of power to them. There would be NO WAY of determining the time of an accident from the clock ""stopping"" in the Ford Explorer! Electrical tape would NEVER seal portholes of a sloop...especially in a humid tropical climate (Duct tape...maybe..) These details, with the addition to various others, make for a disappointing read in which I found myself skipping lines just to stay interested. Sorry T.J.M., nice try...but next time you decide to write a book...check the details (or find a more knowledegable editor)."
3,"Fast, easy book but not intriguing","This book has an interesting premise but relies too extensively on coincidence. In that sense it reminds me of Joe Esterhaus movies. The novel is easy to read and moves quickly.The editors should do the author the courtesy of correcting misuse of words. For instance, page 104 mentions ""voices . . . clambering to be heard"" rather than clamoring; and there is a reference to one character's ""imminently practical wife"" on 18. We must suppose that soon she will be practical.If you want a good thriller, try Eleven Days, City of Ice, or California Fire & Life. If you want a stunningly good novel, check out Gold Bug Variations.Laura"
4,Not good for attachments,I have had a Royal upright vacuum for almost 10 years and the only thing that has gone wrong is a broken spring that holds up the handle.The only 'bad' feature to this model is that using attachments is the biggest hassle and I have never used mine because of it. You have to remove the belt to attach the hose and putting the belt back on is extremely hard.Basically if you only want a vacuum for carpets this is it but don't bother with attachments.
4,Beautiful smell,"This perfume has a wonderful fresh clean smell for the summer. The scent only comes in an eau de toilette and not a parfum so it does not last extremely long *minus one star for that. I would not purchase this from Aroma Boutique though; they sent me an unsealed, used product and did not refund my money. The only place you seem to be able to purchase Anna Sui (besides online) is Victoria's Secret, so if you want to test it out I suggest stopping by there."
1,Disappointed,"There is a great opening chapter: glib, clever, witty. From chapter two on, there is one five letter word for this book: TRASH.Typical LA junk."
4,A fun book!,"This book is loads of fun! It is the perfect summer beach read. It is what it is, a sexy Hollywood romp, it is not supposed to me Shakespeare. I loved reading this book, because it was funny, and it was a perfect summertime read."
2,A novel isn't a screenplay...,"OK,disappointment is the 1st thing that comes to mind. Bochco has developed some of my fav TV programs; innovative, provocative...I expected the same. What I think Mr. Bochco didn't understand is that a novel requires more detailed info than a screen play & that's 1 of the problems. These characters are flat. Yeah, they have 'in your face..[love scences]', but it's not sensual or arrousing. It's just poking and proding. The author, aka narrator, is TELLING the story, not SHOWING the reader. The twists of plot were very good. The tidey ending was clever. And maybe this is a view of inside Hollywood. If so, what a horrible place to be addicted to. The read was fast & easy, but I think I'd wait for the paperback & a vacation on the beach."
4,Some really nice passages...,"Being always willing to give an industry oriented book a shot, I picked up this entertaining page turner with no preconcieved notions in my head. It was penned by Steven Bochco- the creative force behind TV shows like Hill St. Blues, NYPD Blue, and L.A. Law- and spins a windy tale about a blocked screenwriter, sexual escapades, money, and murder. While the writing is a bit predictable and sluggish at times, and the attempt to come across blunt and gritty just feels forced, its still a fun and entertaining read with a nice touch of dark humor. The narrative is engaging and the twists will make your brain smile. It reads like a decent movie script in need of an editor: fun and full of potential."
2,Technically OK but unpalatable,"This author gets a bit too cute with his fun-loving, profane personality. He likes to talk about sex, and failure, and the dark things in the human soul, but by page 20 his shtick gets old. The mystery behind this book, in technical terms, is well-executed, but the characters are as dead as toy plastic soldiers and have about the same range of emotions. Bochco tries to talk us through it with a series of narrative visions of Hollywood, but these end up being repetitive instead of clever. Was he drunk? He gunked up a fairly competent mystery with a lack of humanity, or maybe, an inner desire to wallow in the grey side of humanity, which is not the evil aspects but the boringly predictable and degenerative ones. I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone."
4,Recommended for Mature Audiences,"Although I would agree with many of the negative comments, this is nonetheless a fun read. Be prepared for an over-the-top, sex-heavy account of Hollywood goings on.If the characters had been ""fleshed out"" and some of the tangents (although enlightening) had been relegated to the cutting bin, it would have improved this read. Even so, I got the book at the dollar store and it was definitely worth the money!"
2,Disappointing from an NYPD-B fan,"Unfortunately, Bochco should stick to TV, where he RULES!The writing is poor, and the plot was predictable. I got it because I absolutely love NYPD-Blu, a masterpiece"
5,A Very Big Surpise. I LOVED IT!!,I was given this book as a present from someone whom I don't really share the same tastes with; however I started to read it because I really didn't have anything else at the time. I could not believe how I got sucked into this book! It had had some great twists and was very funny at time too. You can really tell this guy knows Hollywood inside and out.
3,Not mainstream,"Death by Hollywood is one of those books you just keep reading in an effort to figure out why you keep reading it. Is the story going to get better? Are the characters going to improve? Where is the story actually going? The book was ok. I got the distinct impression reading it that this book was written for Bochco's Hollywood friends and supporters more than for the public-at-large. There are a lot of ""in"" references that won't really have any impact on people not affiliated with the biz. I felt like an outsider looking in on this story and it didn't really involve me as much as I'd hoped. Despite being about a murder, the book wasn't that graphic, but was definitely very heavy on profanity. It wasn't scholarly material by any means but was a quick read with some suprisingly good humor about the human existance."
5,"Come on Folks, this is funny.","I just read most of the reviews about ""Death by Hollywood"" and I am amazed. Bochco has written a wonderfully frank romp through the Industry that sells more newspapers and magazines than the Bush Adminstration. Most of the reviewers used this space to sound off about literature in general. Come on folks, get a sense of humor and hang on for the ride. ""Its the jokes stupid"""
3,A Nice Dessert,"DEATH BY HOLLYWOOD is a nice confection served up by a writer who knows his way around the kitchen. The plot works, the characters are stereotypical (we'd be disappointed if they weren't) and the narrative is laced with jokes and anecdotes. There is something about Hollywood that leads to spicy anecdotes and off-center quotes. Part of it is the get-rich-quick/get-poor-quick ethos; part of it is the argot of Jewish moguls from the east who ran an industry that was unfamiliar but which they came to understand in their own way; part of it is the trove of stories that undergird every new story. Whatever it is, Bochco understands it and taps into it. This is a quick read and good fun."
2,Was Excited to Read...Big Let Down,"Although the story was good, this was not a good book. Steven Bochco is SO GREAT with his TV shows and I thought his book was be equally entertaining....not so. The language is very explicit and raw, the story is good but he floats from writing from 3 different perspectives and it takes a while to figure out who's who. There are so many other good books out there, read them first before this one."
2,a quick review,"Just a small criticism: You'd think that after all those years of working with Jimmy Smits (on ""NYPD Blue"") he would have picked up some authentic Spanish! On p. 80 Ramon's maid finds his body and says ""Es muerte."" (""Is death."")- She probably should have said ""Esta muerto."" (accent on the ""a."")"
4,The Wheels on this Book go Round & Round,"""Beverly Hills. What a country!"" This is a fun little (stretched to 274 pages with wide margins) murder mystery by Hollywood insider Steven Bochco. It is also part chronicle, part spoof of the wheeler/dealers of Bochco's milieux with a wink to Franz Kafka. Readers will know some of the players. Daniel ""(God forbid you called him Dan or Danny)"" Deveaux (p. 245+) seems a Dead Ringer for David Caruso <- former prima donna of Bochco's NYPD Blue. The wheels on this Hollywood tour de farce keep rock & rolling `til The End. Reviewed by TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer."
3,it was alright...,"ok, while this wasn't the *greatest* thing in the world it was an ok read. it had interesting enough plot, although the general tone seemed a little bit to informal, almost like two guys talking in a locker room, i'd recomment it to anyone looking to pass the time."
1,Appalling,"This book is dreadful. Vulgar, ugly, and boring, alternating with pointless, stupid, and pathetic. Other than that, I hated the book. The editors who brought this book to light did a terrible disservice to Mr. Bochco, who is a great talent in the world of television."
3,enjoyable book if you have a free afternoon,"It really is a pretty good read, but purely for entertainment purposes. Don't look for anything deeper; it's not there. Just a pretty good, if fanciful, story. Best bought in paperback, because you'll likely finish it in one or 2 sittings; it's not long and reads very quickly."
2,Wish I Hadn't,"Being a fan of Bochco's TV work, I was really looking forward to reading this book. I was also worried that with only a little over 200 pages (and not small font print)the story would be a little thin. I was right.The first thing I didn't like about the book was it being written in third person. You are being told what happened to the main character, told by his agent. It was a plot with great potential, just told through the wrong eyes and it kind of just ""ended"", on a flat note at that.Although I read this book in one day, it wasn't because I was engrossed in the plot, I was just trying to get to the ""good part""..it just never came."
3,"a solid book, but nothing special","Patrick Ryan's book on Geometry is not too advanced, give a good introduction, and importantly avoids pedantry and excessive abstraction. At the same time, the notation could be made much more clear, the examples could be better, and there could be much more depth to the book while still keeping it accessible.However, I do like the organization of the book by kind of Geometry, and comparisons and contrasts between the different geometries in the introduction for each section. But given that I am not a visual thinker, I at least would have preferred more diagrams and explanations about how to think about these topics.It is a solid book, and not too rigorous, although the notation at times makes it more confusing than it should be, but I am sure that there are much better books out there."
5,Great math book,This book about euclidean and non-euclidean geometry is great! A must for researh or math class!
1,Bad hinge design!!!,"I bought one at an Office Depot, and the same day was shocked to find all four hinges (rigid plastic) snapped off when I tried to pick it up. I took it back to the store, and got a replacement, thinking that perhaps the box had had a crack at the hinges. The very next evening, when I opened the lid, it swung back and I watched, dumbfounded, as two of the hinges snapped in two again! The lid is too heavy for these hinges, and when it swings back they snap. I do not recommend that one of these type boxes are purchased without checking out the hinges."
5,A great read!,"I couldn't put this book down and it lingered in my mind for weeks after reading it.It's clear from the details in Rowe's elegant prose that he conducted extensive research. And he didn't shirk from writing sometimes less-than-flattering portraits of these iconic men based on what he learned about them. The book is all the better for this ""warts and all"" approach. In the glossy, Disney-fied culture that is America today, revisionist history that gives us a more realistic view of our roots is welcome -- especially when it's as well written as this."
2,Amateurish and Poorly Characterized,"The writing in this book is very amateurish. It is roughly the quality you would expect from a high school sophomore who received a B-. If you go to the author's web site, you can read a few excerpts there and see this for yourself.An even worse problem is that the characters do not act as you would expect. They seem more like lampoons of the founding fathers, rather than the fathers themselves.Despite these flaws, Rowe deserves some credit for presenting an interesting, if far-fetched, scenario and including a few mildly humorous scenes in it."
5,"Great Book, Fast Read","This book held my attention from the very beginning. Somewhere between pages 5 and 6 I realized I was ""learning"" (not the normal expected result of my reading choices.) The book brought up ideas I had never though about and questioned parts of everyday life we don't normally question. I would recommend this book to all!!"
4,Good Stuff,"I typically am not a fan of historical fiction, but after reading the first 40 pages, I realized this book was different, after 60 pages, I was hooked. Rowe brings the Founding Fathers to life and allows a glimpse into their thoughts, morals and motivations and how they apply in today's America. Other books tell me about our Founding Fathers, but Tempus Fugit gave me the chance to actually meet them. I find myself thinking about the book and characters often and I am anxiously awaiting Rowe's next book."
3,Journeyman's Skills,Decent and addresses the subject matter adequately. The fills and essentials are perfect for not only beginners but even advanced drummers.Worth the money to increase your knowledge.
3,Ok,The item was as listed and came in a timely fashion however my son didn't use it and its still not being used.
3,"Good, But Not Great","Its hard the grade material, unless you have something to compare it to. By itself, it does serve its purpose, but lacks energy. And, if you compare it to Groove Essentials 1.0, with Tommy Igoe, the it becomes apparent that video quality could be better, does lack energy, and that the there could be much more material that isn't covered, when compared to Groove Essentials 1.0. Therefore, I would counsel even the greenest of students to seriously take a look at Groove Essentials 1.0... Sorry, Chris Taylor."
3,Poor sound quality,"Not bad for beginners, but only shows using matched grip instead of classical. VERY difficult to understand what the guy is saying due to poor microphone placement and sound quality. I would have rated this much higher if the quality of the sound was better."
3,"good beginner demonstration, too expensive.","I purchased this mostly for my wife to get some tips from it, but she's already somewhat more advanced than the lessons that was being offered by this person. too repetitive as he was trying to show the steps by steps again and again and because of that, will take him long to move on to the next step of teaching. Is good for someone, rather a child trying to ""just"" starting to learn how to play."
2,Pretty disappointing...,"Books like these are designed to answer the question: ""Okay, just what am I looking at here?"" and ""What purpose does [this book or that book] serve?"", and occasionally: ""Okay now that I've read Joshua [or something] what interesting things did I not notice?""I LOVE books that survey the Bible by book, but this one isn't good. Information provided for each book is comparable to what you'd find in a study Bible: authorship, location/time, etc. without getting into the good parts.And seminary? Not even close.Really I expected better from the likes of Gordon Fee and company.Go with ""What the Bible is All About"" instead. It's got kind of a juvenile atmosphere to it, but has been the preeminent book in its category for years and years (has sold over 10 million copies!) and with good reason. If you can find a copy of Orr's book, ""A Layperson's Introduction to the Bible"" or something like that, it's a more scholastic version of the same thing. They've both really great.This one isn't."
2,Some what helpful,"I wanted to get a true understanding of the bible broken down in plain simple english and this book tryed but I needed more simple terms, What I ended up doing was reading the very end of each chapter and thats where I found the meanings of each chapter. Very disappointed because it was just a few words and I was looking for a lot more."
1,How to Read the Bible Book by Book,"This is NOT what I was looking for. I am sure I will use it, but it is more of a Reference book than a user friendly companion book. This is what I was looking for."
2,dissapointed...,i could only read an hour of this. the 1st 3 chapters are on the bible code. the rest is probably just as bad.
4,"Good, but necessarily brief","I appreciate the opportunity to get background information on each part of the Bible, but I find the online version awkward to use. Because the attempt is to cover a little of everything, the amount of background information is necessarily limited. This book has, however, done an admirable job of packing a lot of information in a small package."
4,Very useful bible study aide,"This book is very useful for overview of bible contents. It is about content, not technique.Highly recommended for the layman studying the bible."
4,Great tire changer for price,"I saw this considerably cheaper and bought it. I have done it manually the hard way for years with just spoons and bars. Recently I ran into 8 old truck tires I needed to move around and could not get the bead to break. That is when I bought this. After just a few minutes to easily assemble, I used this tool to break down the tires in about 3 minutes per tire. Mounting is easy with this also. You do have to use a little muscle, but my daughter can do it and she is only 11. It is build sturdy enough, just make sure to bolt it down. Bolting to a pallet works if you do not have concrete to bolt to. I bolted it onto my 16ft trailer so I can add/remove it when I need to. The only thing I did not like as much was the mounting end of the tire tool. With a little grinding, I improved it and it works great now."
1,Berk tire changer,"This is junk ! The install end of the bar is improperly shaped and won't stay in the tire while trying to mount a tire. Tried to hold it in and down and wound up mashing a couple of fingers. Had to spend an hour whith a die grinder reshaping the end to get it to work. The hold-down device was stiff and difficult to screw down on the rim because of sloppy thread cutting. The whole thing is an exercise in imperfect, sloppy, lackadaisical work that comes out of China. I should have asked where it was made before purchasing. Buy American !"
4,Great product,"For the home garage, this is a great product at a very reasonable price. I purchased it specifically to change ATV tires at home and in the field as needed.Pros: Easy to use, well-built, durable, heavy-duty materials that should last a lifetime, easy to mount to a pallet or wooden floor trailer for portability.Cons: No instruction manual included with changer - - without a manual and unless you have worked in a tire shop, you are lost when it comes to changing a tire. I got online and found a great instructional manual/video at [...], which proved to be invaluable. An additional tire spoon or two would have been helpful.Overall, this is a great product and I highly recommend it. I would have given it five stars but the lack of a ""how-to"" manual lowers my score."
4,Berk Automotive Portable Car Truck ATV Tire Changer,"Just the right amount of equipment to get the job done. Nothing too fancy, but not junky. Great for the occasional tire change. You can get it out when you need to, so it doesn't have to sit there taking up space in the shop for months at a time."
5,One of the most interesting movies I have ever watched.,"I have no idea how many times I have watched this movie, but I enjoy it every single time that I do watch it. Each time I see this movie I pick up something that I had not noticed before, a fact which makes this movie even more exciting.Angie Harmon is especially beautiful in this movie. She adds a lot to the movie with her beauty and tremendous acting ability. She has true talent, making the movie even more believable than it already is. All the other actors add a tremendous amount of excitement and believability to the movie through their own efforts and tremendous talents.I do have to say that the acting pool for ""Video Voyeur"" is perfect. No better actors could have been chosen to create this movie or to make it the great work that it is. For the talent alone in this movie I would recommend it to anyone old enough to watch it. It is a must! Buy this video if you can, folks! It is definitely worth your time!"
4,Meant for All TV Movie Fans!,"""Video Voyeur"" is an emotional thrill ride into the life of Susan Wilson, a woman whose perfect life is brought to a halt when she finds tiny spy cams everywhere in her house. Although this is not one of my top film faves, I recommend it for anyone who loves TV movies (especially those awesome Lifetime dramas!). You will truly feel Susan's struggle to cope with the embarrassment,anger, and frustration of this ordeal because this type of violation can happen to any of us. Plus, Angie Harmon is excellent in her role!"
4,Growing up Bronx in Brooklyn,"When I was told about this documentary that many had seen on Showtime, I wondered why were they telling me since I grew up in The Bronx and this is about about a group of friends that grew up in Brooklyn. Well I can tell you I don't care where you are from see this film, especially you ""baby boomers"". See it but listen to the dialog that's where the magic is.It's a look into the lives of many of us who survived The Cuban Missle Crisis, The Bay of Pigs,Vietnam, Watergate,The Grateful Dead and so much more."
5,Ineffable......,If you are of a certain age this movie is beyond words. Likely you know most of themfolk in it. Terribly sad and hopeful at the same time. Beware of luck and fate.
1,Beware of possible fake 5 star reviews,"This book made me shake my head reading it. The dialogue was horrible--unbelievable and sophmoric. It was like the author was trying to be funny but really was not. The character development and plot were almost nonexistent, and what I did learn about the characters I mostly didn't like. There were a lot of editing errors as well, which I could have overlooked if the story was good. It was full of cliches, for example the opening scene the cops are eating donuts, the master vampire owns a nightclub, etc.I am very annoyed that I spent $15 on this book based on all the positive reviews and now find the positive reviews suspect. Scanning the reviews more closely I see several are copy and pasted with only minor changes. It makes me think the author got a bunch of her friends to do reviews on her behalf."
2,Just Can't Get Motivated to Finish,"Okay, this series came recommended to me by a friend who warned me in advance that the first book had a ridiculous amount of spelling/grammatical errors, so I was prepared for that. She even recommended I buy a used copy. Of which, I did.So, spelling and grammar errors aside (I'm all for looking over the occasional typo, but so many errors are rather distracting), I can't finish this book. Like one of the other reviewers have said, it's like a bunch of characters having their own storyline. I don't care about any of these characters, they don't pull me in. In order for me to care about a book, I have to feel like I'm being pulled into the world that I'm reading about. I don't know whether it's the writing itself or the spelling/grammar errors detracting from the flow. It was one of those books where you say, ""It's gotta get better than this."" I stopped on page 95."
1,horrible,"I bought this on the strength of it's cover and blurb. It looked very interesting. Maybe it is. I don't know. I read the first couple chapters and threw it in my give away pile. I felt like I was reading a book written by a middle schooler. I couldn't get past the grammar, the spelling. It was just a waste of money for me."
1,I'm Sorry But This Is The Worst,"Book I have ever read. I have been reading books for over twenty five years and have very rarely just wanted to throw one in the trash.I tried to read this book I believe I made it to chapter 12 or 13 and still very little was happening. No real romance, little history, to many people with not enough interaction, almost no crime discussion and even the sex wasn't to hot. The spelling and grammar didn't bother me too much except when a whole sentence didn't make sense due to a word that just didn't belong there.I have never written a review and normally wouldn't, but I am hoping to save someone from wasting the too large amount of cash for this book. It is definitely not worth it."
1,She needs an editor!,"The book is full of poor spelling, bad syntax and random commas. Phrases such as ""Marshall law"" instead of ""martial law"" render this book nearly unreadable for anyone literate."
3,Avid Reader,"I have just barely begun to read this book and am absolutely disgusted by the grammatical and spelling errors. Just because this does not quite qualify as ""quality literature"" does not mean that it should not go through the normal publishing process. Editors need to still edit no matter what the content. Also, some of these the author should have fixed too. Besides the errors, I find the book rather entertaining. I have just started to read this genre and find this book a good edition to it."
5,"LKH & AR fans, this new series is a must read!","This book is totally awesome! From the moment I started reading, I fell madly in love with the characters and plot. These were characters I could relate to, they appeared to be ""real"". The dialogue is not at all cliche or ditzy. This new series is exciting, humorous and extremely erotic and above all, original. Sure, they are some errors, which the author apologized for, but they did not stop me from thoroughly enjoying this fantastic novel!I urge anyone who is into supernatural literature to delve into Knight of the Darkness chronicles!I can not WAIT until the next book, I'm on pins and needles right now!"
3,type-o heaven,"i liked the storyline, the characters were interesting; but the book was difficult to get through because it was froth with spelling and grammatical mistakes. anyone with enough time to read the book would have picked up on the myriad of errors. it left me feeling that no one bothered to edit the work before sending it to print."
5,Guitar Like You've Never Heard!,"I had the great fortune of hearing Don Ross live in a very intimate gathering in New Jersey. He is unbelievable! He plays better live than he does on his recordings. He exudes such feeling that it makes you want to laugh, cry and it definitely makes you want to play the guitar! Do yourself a favor and buy Passion Sessions. Don does not do much touring in America, but I think we will soon be seeing him perform here. If you get the chance, go and see him. You won't regret it!"
2,technically great monotony,"This guy has got technique to burn but seldom plays with much feel. He often gets caught up in playing too many notes and doesnt let the guitar breath. there are 3 good tracks on this album - find them if you'd like. Personally, I'd rather continue building my Kottke collection."
4,Well Documented,Well put together book and global manufactureres of seven's.It's interesting reading the individual histories and looking at the respective pictures how the car has been developed.Good reference material.
4,Mainstream LEGO train documentation,"Well written, lots of research, with the three model diagrams being the highlight of this book. Beginners will have to put the book down, get the bricks they need, then come back to build McKee's great designs. I would have ordered the designs a bit differntly, however, with easier designs first, leading up to the more complicated engine design.<br /><br />There's a lot of good reference here, and the author is quite thorough when following through on his assumed intentions to introduce LEGO trains into the mainstream. He's broken ground and set a very high standard for others to follow."
3,just OK,Good for the price but didn't really offer much insight. As a beginner I wish it had more on how to lay out track and less as an idea book.
5,Excellent Lego book,This is a well written and thought out book. It shows how to easily start and enjoy modelling with Lego Trains. The world of model trains with Lego is limitless and Jake does a great job of bringing novices and experts alike into the many aspects you can explore with the Lego train system. This is a must have book for anyone who enjoys playing with Lego
4,there are better songs,"strong is definetely a good song and worth to be released on a single cd, but i do not think that it is one of the best releases of robbie williams. that's the reason why i can't give five stars"
3,THE UNDEFINABLE HAYDN SOUND,"A conductor may excel at the music of Ravel or Debussy and yet be lacking when it comes to the music of Haydn. Charles Dutoit made a remarkable entrance in the field of CD recordings when London released his version of Daphnis et Chloé in the 90`s. There was innovation and the kind of sound that had been absent. In this set of Haydn symphonies, Dutoit is found lacking. The recorded sound is very good, but the interpretation lacks the kind of perspective or precision that conductors like Szell or Dorati have brought. This is sloppy. Even the London presentation is poorly done... no movement timings, no tempo markings. Altogether, a set to be avoided if one wants Haydn."
2,lame,"its boring there is very very little nudity in this videoall the girls have nasty faces except one of themthe dancing gets boring after a whilethe artists that perform on this video are Genio Kil@, Fanta y Cele, Jan y Fade, Blade Pacino, Charlie y Kingston and a few othersif it werent for the artists performing live i would rate this a 1 or 0 if i could"
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED...,"When I seen the preview for this Party Edition Vol 1 Reggaeton DVD on another Gatas DVD I thought it was the best GATAS SANDUNGUERAS DVD available, but thats not the case here. I was hoping to see some stripping down in the club but most of the girls did not even get naked for the camera. The only decent part of this DVD was when the girls were in a club in PUERTO RICO doing a dance contest. To sum it up I was very dissapointed with this DVD."
4,Elizabeth Woodville: Mother of the Princes in the Tower,"I enjoyed this book very much. I had previously held to the opinion that Elizabeth Woodville was a social climbing, ambitious and manipulative person who was able to influence her husband to do whatever she wanted. This, of course, was based on the accounts of a later time when the Tudors were ""looking back in anger"".This book puts her in a more sympathetic light and shows that she was truly a woman of her time.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Richard 111 and the Wars of the Roses."
3,An fascinating lady,"A complex book about a complex woman in complex times. I knew little about Elizabeth Woodville until I discovered this book but after digesting the detailed material within, you are completely briefed on the person, the extended family, the politics and the times. The tragedy of her children, the ruthlessness of power around her etc, can only mean you conclude the book with great sympathy for Woodville. I commend this book despite the rather dull prose (at times)"
1,Terrible coffee!,"There is no way I would have known beforehand exactly how Greek coffee tasted. I went on the recommendation of an article citing it's medicinal qualities. I'm sorry but this was the worst tasting coffee I've EVER had! The seller was quick and had a good price but again, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COFFEE!"
1,Shafted,"well if you want the Shaft... buy this video... But if your smart and put the money to use for something you really want,then pass this movie by inspite of the other viewpoints. not saying mines tops all but even for a mockery film this one doesn't even cut it. those viewers must of had some nice trees to watch this... So don't get SHAFTED on this s@*% i mean shaft..."
2,ok for the price,"When I first hooked them up they sounded great, however after a period of a month or two the couldn't handle the juice, the heated up and the voice coiles fried, I went on and went with some rockford fostgate p3's and these are worth the extra money, I found them online for about $118 a piece."
3,"Excellent portability, difficult stability","This tripod is helpful for needing to get close to the ground of your photography subject and has an incredibly low height. The quick release shoe is easy to use and attach to a camera. It has the capability to extend out to a 90 degree angle to the ground if your camera is looking down on an object, but this makes the tripod unstable if used with anything other than a very, very compact camera. The tripod is very small and lightweight, and fits easily into the front pocket of a midsize camera bag."
4,"Good TriPod, no ball swivel","Just wanted to clarify... your camera's field of vew will NOT be adjustable when using this TriPod, because there is no center ball attachment.One reviewer reported ""you will actually receive Sima ST-10K,"" which has a ball head mount. I assumed that I would also get this substitution, however I did not. As indicated, I received the ST-10T without the ball head.And because I was looking forward to the ball adjustment, I found myself frustrated with this (non ball-head) model.In outdoor scenes, I had to search for a reasonably level surface that was at the proper height, in order to properly place my tripod/camera, because you can not adjust your camera to raise or lower its field of vision, since there is no center ball on the tripod.If you want to be able to raise/lower your camera's field of vision once the tripod is set up, you may want to choose the ST-11K."
4,perfect for ELPH,"Basic, compact, easy-to-use mini tripod. Perfect fortaking closeups of stationary objects with an ELPHwhen you need greater stability than you could get holding it yourself."
2,FloorPlan Basic Software,FloorPlan 3D is capable of drawing basic layouts of a two story structure and placing within most elements. It is difficult to use and is limited to the range of elements and custom designs. Upgrades and patches are not currently available. Technical assistance is on a fee basis.
3,Comprehensive and wordy,"This book gives a good overview of lots of different theories in Anthro and Tourism. She also spatters the book with various examples. However, it is wordy and not an easy read. In general, I would say if you are looking to really study, this is a good book. It is not a leisurely read."
2,A Serious Disappointment,"In view of the lack of modern books on this subject, and the failure to reprint the standard (and admirable) biographies, this monument of modern academic P & P (pedantry and pedagogy) is seriously disappointing. If you are seeking enlightenment about this motivation and methods of this most sublime of composers --- look elsewhere. This is a view through a microscope of the vast Brucknerian universe. You will, however, get a glimpse of current efforts to achieve tenure in academe. The standard works (in addition to Simpson, Schoenzeler, and Doernberg, perhaps the recent compilation by Stephen Johnson)remain essential --- so search the used book sites."
4,Give Us More!,I loved this little book. It is the perfect gift book for yourself or anyone else you know who has experienced the joy of sailing. The photos are great - very beautiful - they capture the many moods of sailing: from sheer excitement to calm reflection. The quotes are wonderfully chosen and are some of the most eloquent quotes about sailing by famous authors and others. ENJOY! I only give it 4 stars out of 5 because I wish it was longer!
3,A Biography about Christian Persecution under Communism,"This book contains events depicting the brutal repression of the Christian religion in a Balkan country. It also documents many, many faith healing experiences performed by the author during his struggle, and multiple apparitions of angels or spirit beings who protected the author. A prediction of the ""end times"" on earth, based on a dream and a vision, is offered and very thought provoking. The reader considers some of the events revealed for the ""end times"" highly unlikely based on his military experience and knowledge of modern weaponry. However, the scenerio leading to Armageddon may be likely based on the current economic conditions in the far east which could lead to the formation of an alliance of countries in that area that was previously thought most unlikely."
3,The book has some interesting ideas...,"A note to David Haggith: Duduman has died since he wrote this book. I am not certain of the clarity of the page time theory. Granted though, it can be rather vague. And making dates is the surest way to find out if the person is a prophet or ... I think as we are now in a situation with Iraq, this book lends itself to speculations which feed our fear. God isn't the author of fear, so consider the source."
5,They are still going on,"They are powerful as always.... sound and video quality is really good. And they are not just old timer who want to appeal to people, want to live in 80's as me. They are still great and the best. Wow, during their live I am still living in 80's.. What a happy time"
5,OVERKILL - Wrecking Everything DVD,"This DVD, filmed live in New Jersey(OVERKILL's hometown),puts the facts on the table for all to see. OVERKILL are the kings of Thrash & Speed Metal! Period! They are on top of their game and Bobby ""Blitz"" Ellsworth & the rest of the band are on fire! The crowd is great too, a real heartfelt performance from OVERKILL + a 2nd DVD featuring extras, clips and rarities. Easily the best DVD on the market!"
2,Poorly directed .. but hey .. its Overkill,"If you're into Overkill, just go ahead and pick this up, because DD and Bobby are still churning out decent speed metal and more importantly many of their older, greater songs are here. What I dislike about this DVD is the sterility of the directing/footage. It is almost like the audience and band were shot on different sets, there is little ""in your face"" interaction. Of course, my separate shooting theory is BS, because thats NOT how it was shot, but the camera work is quite focused or claustrophobic - one shot lingering on one band member (or on the audience), with very few wide shots or shots from ""within"" the audience (see Emperor DVD for great shots from ""within"" the audience). Another problem that may just be my player, but the sound editing seems a little off - the song just ahead or behind the visual (very annoying .. anyone else notice this?). However, it is Overkill and they play a spot-on set, as usual."
4,Rockin DVD,For all metal fans in the world... This is the real deal. The second disc is very cool. Behind the music for Overkill...DVD #1 covers the whole career... Rock on...
3,Should have been better,"The main problem with this DVD is that the audio & video aren't always in synch. It was a long show but I think they played too much old stuff. If you're not familiar with the newer stuff, I urge you to check it out. The extras are good but you only need to see them once. Like most concert DVD's, it's average."
3,Not what I expected,"The figures look cool if you get ones that actually fit together. The pieces alone were fine but most of them barely fit together and some pieces were warped/bent, preventing the full piece from standing straight. Many of the components had to be glued to stay connected. A couple pieces were also broken and had to be glued back together. Also, some boxes contained black ""hockey puck"" shaped discs, what are these for?"
5,Extraordinary!,"This is a remarkable book--an unrelenting, brutally honest and insightful examination of the dynamics of gender relationships in a patriarchal world. And also a compelling, beautifully written novel. I notice that, astonishingly, it is hardly mentioned in articles about Dr. French. I have a Ph.D. in English, have taught at the university level, am 69 years old, and have spent my adult life reading the best fiction I could get my hand on. That said, this is one of the best I've come across. Dr. French has chosen intimate gender relationships as her topic and has brought more intelligence and courage to the subject than any other novelist I've come across. And she's done so while still telling a completely absorbing tale of love, grief, fury, and survival."
5,I MISS THE ROCK OF AGES,Those were great times back in the 70's and early 1980's. I still study to show myself apporved ... etc :)
4,PFAL: A Good Beginning,"The PFAL developed by Dr. Wierwille was a great blessing for those who found it. It helped us come to know what God truly said and wanted for oul lives. Since the corruption that entered the Way International, many have been searching for something to replace it... Good luck and God Bless."
3,Interesting,"The book has a lot of interesting information. Some of it I don't understand why he put it, other was very revelant. I think he missed out on a lot of other information that was very pertinent to the subject."
4,Simple and Sturdy Keychain LED light,Small LED lights are very handy to carry on your keychain so you will always have a light when using your keys or entering a dark area. I prefer white LEDs such as this one rather than red LEDs. This small bright LED light is well designed and by a good manufacturer (Gerber) in stainless steel with rubber armoring. The switch is slightly recessed and has a nice action compard to the inexpensive membrane switches of other lights I have purchased. The light is slightly larger than a quarter in diameter and approximately the thickness of three quarters. I paid $7.50 which is a good value; the price has varied from $7.00 to $9.00. I have had my light about one month. The unanswered question at this point is whether it will last a few months or a few years.August 2008 Update: Still working well at the 8 month point; seems durable.
5,Best Superauto I've used.,"I have been using Saeco machines for 5 years and the Magic Comfort Plus redesign is by far the best. It functions without a hitch and has a extra large dreg draw, drip tray and bean hopper making it great for low maintenance cappaccino production. The grinder is quiet compared to the Saeco/Starbucks Digital Italia that I thankfully received a refund for. Steam production is powerful and quick.This machine is Saeco's top consumer model, suitable for a small office. It is built for performance, not show and is logically designed and easy to work on. According to several technicians I have conversed with it is the one they would buy. After trying to save a few bucks going with cheaper models I am happy going to the better unit. With proper maintenance it should last for years"
1,This ...!!!!!!!,If you are an Ozzy fan or a music fan of any type then DO NOT buy this trash!!!!! This is one of the poorest quality videos that I have ever seen. The information is wrong half of the time and most of the footage is not even of Ozzy. The portion of the tape that is actually an interview with the Ozzman is over 10 years old and badly edited.
1,TOTAL GARBAGE!,"I am the biggest Ozzy fan in the world. I have 5 autographs, I have collectibles, every cd, rare stuff... you get the point. I know the facts and I have seen every Ozzy piece there is. This is the worst piece ... I have ever seen. This looks like someone made it in their basement with a cam-corder. It has no concert footage, no ozzy music and no new information to offer. I am not joking. This stinks. Knowing Ozzy, don't be surprised if he speaks out against this unauthorized piece of junk and tells you not to buy it. He always deals with quality. He will be very angry to see this- so was I and you will be too. Words cannot express how angry I was at this ""thing"". ..."

4,Amaze your colleagues,I bought this book hoping to learn more about macros and visual basic. I learned more than I expected. My colleagues have been using Excel longer than I have and wonder how I know so much about Excel. I wish I had this book when I was in engineering college. Knowing the solver Add-in would have earned me a higher grade guaranteed.
5,Tasty little survey,"Alan Feinberg is one of the finest pianists interpreting contemporary music today. Anything he does deserves a listen. This album is a little survey of mostly mid to late 20th Century piano music. And it is a delight. It covers a variety of styles from jazz age through serialism and even a little minimalism. Many pieces recorded here are not to be found elsewhere. It is a shame that this has gone out of print. Get a used copy if you can you will not regret it. Perhaps some visionary record company can re-release it. Do you hear me New World Records, Naxos?"
3,No headphone jack on unit,"Contrary to the product description, there is no headphone jack on the unit. Only reason I bought it, decided to keep it and solve my headphone jack requirement in a different fashion."
5,6 speaker selection,"With neighbors close by I need lots of speakers everywhere so the main speakers do not have to be turned up loud to be heard everywhere. This 6 speaker selector solves the problem. It sits on top of the amp and is easy and convienient to switch different sets of speakers on and off. I can have all of them on at a low volume and everyone can hear in the house, the back yard, up on the deck. It is a really good deal for the money."
4,Great value for the price!,"purchased this item for whole house audio with 5 pairs of speakers to be hooked up. the impedance protection is great for multiple pairs as it prevents the amp from overheating.Pros: works exactly as statesCons: plastic button feel cheap, they work though!"
1,Absolute junk!,"Junk! Two of 6 speaker pairs were non-functional(taking hours of tedious rewiring to diagnose). Three of 6 plastic switches broken. 5 crappy indicator color bars get stuck half way. Doses NOT accept 14 guage speaker wire as advertised. There is no headphone jack. Even the crappy undersized stickers fell off. Overall build quality is terrible. I'm neither a snob, nor an audiophile: I just wanted a new speaker switcher. Consumers should know this is a very bad product. Called manufacturer who had the nerve to suggest I buy their ""better"" model at $400.00!!!"
4,Works as intended,"Great for what it is. I was expecting more options for incoming lines, but if you're working with only one source, it's fine."
2,Was not very funny,"This book was a compilation of anecdotes from 40 years of working in the White House. Although I found some stories to be humorous, I enjoyed very little of the book. Although the cute stories humanize our nations presidents, knocking down their ""God like"" image, I believe that there was no reason behind writing this book besides the fact that she could.I found some stories interesting, and I even cracked a smile on a rare occasion, but for the most part, this was just a silly way for Ms. Thomas to get money for a whole lot of who cares. Maybe if I had grown up during the past 40 years she was referring to, I might appreciate it more, but for the younger reader, it offers very little in entertainment."
3,"Mostly fluff, but tidbits are interesting","I think it may have taken Helen Thomas less than ten days to throw this book together. It is mostly fluff, not worth a large sum of money, but has interesting tidbits in it. A fast reader can digest this in one sitting and not feel a bit mentally fatigued. If you have money to spend, want a little something for your personal library, get it. You'll only read it once."
4,I liked it,What was going on and said in the White House from where she was standing definitely made for some interesting stories. Well written and intimate.
2,Threw it away,"This is a compilation of anecdotes from lots of sources--not just Helen Thomas' personal memories. I did read the entire book, hoping it would get better (like eating pretzels).She opens the book by saying that, in response to a request to write the more humorous things presidents have done, the book would be thin. She didn't know how true that remark would be.I threw it away so that someone wouldn't unwittingly pull it from my bookshelves and read it."
2,Not as good as it should have been.,"I thought I was going to be interested in this book. I have seen the press conferences where Helen Thomas closes the session. She certainly had a lot of experience with the various Presidents. However, the jokes were few and far between. In fact, Ms. Thomas seems fixated with herself.She often included less than humorous interactions with her and the various Presidents (Bush I's dog and her as an example). She also seems partisan to the Democrats than Republicans. At the end, I had far too few instances of humor in this book.This is not a great read. It seems as if it is just an additional book from the leftovers of her first book. Look elsewhere for memories."
3,Not a lot of wit and barely any wisdom,"Much to my chagrin, most of the ""memories"" within the book are NOT those of Helen Thomas. She compiled various anecdotes from various members of the White House staff and the press corps and threw them together with no overall sense of cohesion (save the chapter division by president).I have a beautifully autographed copy of the book and cherish it because I know Helen Thomas has been capable of a lot more ""wit and wisdom"" in her many years as a journalist than what this book reflects. If you are looking for an endearing memoir of Helen`s time in the White House, this isn`t it. One does not get a feel for how Mrs. Thomas` job has affected her (aside from her usual cantankerous quips which are readily available from other sources), and the ""writing"" can`t be evaluated as it is simply a bunch of secondary source material strung together by lengthy quotations. In a word, disappointing."
1,Not a Book,This isn't a book - just a bunch of somehwhat biased anecdotes strung together. Helen must have needed the money. Don't waste yours.
3,Nice.,No more or less than a pretty picture book and a fair view of the locality in Los Angeles I've called home for the last two years.
5,Must reading for Silver Lakers!,"As a journalist and Silver Lake resident, I found this book very informative. I have driven or walked by many of the homes featured in the book, and it is fascinating to learn about the people who live in them."
4,Bohemian Modern: Loads of pleasing photos,The book offers a great visual journey into the BOHOMO style
2,Theres got to be something better.,"While this product works, it is cheaply made. Construction is all plastic and it seems to be crudely molded at that. It is very heavy for use on a handheld video camera. Don't let the 20 watt rating fool you. It is very bright, so my subjects often complained about the glare. Sturdiness is a word that can't be used with this product. I dropped it on the floor while trying to attach it to my camera and the case popped open and the light bulb broke rendering it useless. Part of the fault is the clumsy method for securing this thing to the light shoe. There has to be a better way than the screw-type fastener they use.I'm going to give the 3-watt SL-9 a try and forget about this thing."
1,Too much,"This book places too much emphasis on spending money instead of eating...well if we all had money to burn that would be a wonderful lifestyle. Read ""The Fat Fallacy"" instead, it provides much more practical information."
1,But are the recipes any good?,"As a professional dietitian, I am in constant search for a book that translates the science of food and nutrition in a fashion that contains a bit of lightheartedness and down to earth style. The Martini Diet seemed harmless at first and inclusive, until I read that, although achieving a size two was totally unrealistic, at size eight or ten, it was time to adopt the Martini Diet. If anyone out there has tried a few of the recipes, and can advise me to keep this book just for the recipes, then I won't return it. Thanks for your help on this."
4,The Martini Diet,"A good book written with great sense of humor. There is not much about Martini, but the basic of this diet is eat slowly and as much as you needed, but do not exaggerate, and stop when you are not hungry anymore. Use good quality products not something what is ""fat free"" or sugar substitute. The better quality product the smaller portion you eat to satisfy your appetite. It makes sense. `Some recipes are very good!"
3,Kritters Ramblings,"An interesting new take on dieting and eating habits. Indulge in the good things, but keep your hands away when it is meal time. I read this book intrigued by a new concept on how we can change our lifestyles for the better without cutting out all the good stuff.I think my biggest take away was when she said it sort of repetitively - eat the best of the best. Sometimes I choose cost of quality and maybe even end up choosing more calories and less healthy options because of it. So I would like to spend less money and get less food, but better food. I believe that I can tend to buy too many groceries because I don't have a food plan for the week - with a plan, I could probably end up spending less money and also get the better quality options.A great read for the female audience who may have already read a book or two on dieting and would like a different take on it all."
2,"Good, but not great","'Gin' Sanders gives some good advice in this book but there is also alot of fluff and just plain nonsense about why one should eat healthy. For instance she continually writes about how certain foods and ways of eating are 'tacky'. While that may be true, real data on the health benefits of the French diet is probably more helpful than being judgemental. I would recommend Clower's The Fat Fallacy over this."
2,I've read this before somewhere......,"She took all of this from other authors. Even her section of how to eat chocolate is strangely reminisant of Will Clower's (The Fat Fallacy) Chocolate Eating Lessons concept.She makes umpteen references to the French and how they eat -- which I am sure she got from French Women Don't Get Fat.She isn't sure which book she is writing - her Wear More Cashmere book or this one. This book has a few too many references to the Cashmere book not to feel like an advertisement for it. The exercise portion isn't very practical -- unless you have a pool, a dance partner, fencing studio or horse stabled nearby. She talks about her old money upbringing enough to be tiresome...and so you just know that she has never had to try to fit exercise around a full time job.She has some good ideas but unfortunaltey they are someone else's."
5,Another Wonderful Betty Neels,"I own over one hundred books by Ms. Neels, and they are books I turn to again and again over the last 32 years. Her books are all uplifting, sweet and fun, with genuinely loveable characters. Everyone who loves good clean romance with dreamy heroes and feisty heroines should know about Betty's legacy"
3,parts were missing,"luckily my husband bikes a lot, because this bike didn't come with any instructions AND was missing parts. he was able to take parts off of an old bike so all is well, but v. annoying. it was missing the seat post skewer and bolts, as well as both pedals. amazon was nice enough to give us a 20% refund. my daughter's bike also came without instructions..."
4,Good buy.,"This was delivered quickly but unfortunately it was damaged in shipping, Amazon replaced it within 2 days and the second one was in perfect condition. The bike is exactly as advertized and well built."
2,Not the Mongoose I used to know,"This bike looks nice, but as soon as we purchased it, before it was used, we had to take it to a bike shop and pay more money to have the brakes replaced. If I had known about the brakes ahead of time, I would have paid more and purchased a different bike that was safer for my child."
1,Defective and maybe dangerous: bent front fork & sketchy brakes,"I decided to risk the packaging issues reported by other buyers. The box showed up with one corner torn and a few punctures on the sides but nothing appears to be missing.I set out to assemble the bike and noticed that the front fork seems bent together and the wheel hub will not fit in the drop outs. With steel, I would hope I can bend it open enough to accept the wheel but I'm frustrated. There were also a few small defects in the paint that seemed to be factory issues.I anticipate that the brakes could be dangerous. The tension spring is very loosely seated in the caliper. When I tested it, it popped out of the brake. As a result, I expect the spring to detach while riding and make braking difficult. Since there's no coaster brake, this could be dangerous for a child, who's likely to be riding their first bike.I hope to update this review if I can address the fork issue but I would encourage parents to stay away from this bike."
3,Good bike,"Very nice bike but was very disappointed with packaging. The box was torned in multiple place when I received, and there was scratch on the rim. Otherwise it was great bike. My nephew was very happy with bike."
5,Excellent Book,"The Rough Guide to Romania is outstanding. It is intelligently written and comprehensive in its coverage. A few more maps would help, but I'm still glad to have chosen this book over the Lonely Planet book."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I am currently in Romania, with this guide in my hand, and I must say that I am quite disappointed with the content.- The map for Iasi is very inaccurate - so much so that I had to buy an other map and since then I did not get lost- I am traveling to Brasov this weekend and was pretty excited as this guide mentions that there is a festival of Junii that occurs on the first Sunday of May - this was incorrect as I found out on an other site - it is actually on the first Sunday after Easter...somewhat different, somewhat dissappointing.My suggestion to travelers: On the whole it is ok - but it will not be your only source of info, so you might want to look at other guides as well.As a sideline, I had traveled to India with the Rough Guide, and was very satisfied with the content. I never had problems with maps, I liked the way it was organised. I guess this does not hold for all Rough Guides, which is highly disappointing."
2,"OK info, bad organization","The information is not organized in a user-friendly manner. I bought this guide and the Lonely Planet, and basically did not use the Rough Guide because it's not differentiated by category."
3,Dense reading,The book appears to contain a great of timely information. It's just hard to access and it is dense information. Not many pictures.
3,Light reading,This is good for light reading. The writer is reasonably skilled and the character depth is somewhat low. But at least it's somewhat believable in terms of real life without being sleazy.
5,Both practical and beautiful...,"I like this book because it has very detailed ""how to"" instructions to make concrete ornaments for your garden. The ""how to"" illustrations are very clear. The photographs of actual designs are beautiful."
5,Worth it,"I have searched the web, researched via Youtube and taken classes. This book is no doubt the best manual if you are interested in making items using cement. The recipe pages were especially helpful. Equally good for the novice and the experienced craftsman."
4,emphasis on the creative,"This book is for the artisan working with concrete. It provides an excellent overview dealing with the basics of preparation, custom mixes, and casting and forming techniques. This isn't a book for someone to learn how to form a wall, or a sidewalk, or a countertop, though you could easily extrapolate techniques described to do one-of-a-kind projects like those. With each aspect of the process described, there are ample pictures or illustrations for you to get a clear idea of how to proceed with your own project."
4,Great ideas,Really enjoyed the book. Has some great ideas to try with concrete. Lots of photos. Medium level of difficulty. Have not had time to try any yet.
2,Poor printing spoils a good book.,"I was really disappointed in this book. Of course, I love Jane Porter's story, but this edition is definitely poor. My 12 year old daughter has enjoyed our Scribner's Illustrated edition and was looking for a birthday present for a friend. Since the Scribner's is no longer in print we thought perhaps this would do (the price was right). However, for $18, I was really disappointed. The text is so poorly printed that it is hard to read in some places. The tops of some letters are cut off. Others are, randomly, either very faint or very boldly printed. It looks like it has been mimeographed. Now we have to scramble to find a birthday gift. Don't waste your money."
2,Not sure what audience this book is for.,This book was fair. I am not sure who the audience was though. I would not want this book if I was just starting the use of databases but would not want it either if I had been using them a great deal. The book was helpful in some areas but I feel that there needed to be more 'meat' in the book.
2,What is SQL?,I am totally confussed what does SQL stand for? In your book even in the cover page said Standard Query Language .That is not a printing error. I have about 5 different books from Oracle Corporation. All of them explain it as Structured Query Language. My question is who is dummy? Me? You or nobody?
2,A Poorly Written and Unedited WASTE of Money!,"This is not a Dummies book for Beginners which is a shame because that's the whole reason for the series. This book has the feel of a rough draft. The chapters don't flow in a logical order and you have to spend way too much time in the first few chapters flipping to chapters near the end to accomplish anything. Most of the step-by-step instructions are wrong and missing critical information. The humor, which is the hallmark of the series, is contrived and pathetic. In my opinion, this book was written by the author for a quick buck and accepted by IDG to plug a gap in their market. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is because it does come with an excellent companion CD. I would have returned this book for a refund if my job and my company weren't so dependent on my immediately learning Oracle survival skills."
2,Flimsy and small,"This is good for little shoes (like kid shoes). Also, the measurements are wrong. The website lists it as:23""tall x 16""wide x 6""deepIt is actually:6""tall x 23""wide x 16""deepI ended up returning it. It's a good thing it is no longer available on Amazon."
1,Total Junk,"This product was exactly what I was looking for as my daughter has a ton of shoes. I bought three of them and they fit perfectly in the bottom of her closet. Unfortunately, they only lasted maybe a month before they fell apart. My daugher has a lot of tennis shoes and the plastic was unable to withstand the weight of the shoes. The whole rack kept collapsing."
3,Does its job,"Because it is plastic it is quite unstable. Many times walking by you collapses if you walk into it. But it's a good, cheap product if you have a lot of shoes to store and not a lot of room to store them in."
5,A much cherished book,"This is a much cherished book in our family. My son received it when he was 3.5yo. He loved the story and illustrations then and even more now, a year later. My 2yo is frequently drawn to this book and enjoys studying the pictures. The writing is excellent, the tale is told with great respect and the illustrations are riveting. We have recommended or given this book to many families and all have enjoyed immensely."
3,Great story with little historical accuracy,"If you are looking for the true story of the legend of the poinsettia, this is not it!!! The only thing that is the same about the legend from Mexico and this story is the fact that the poinsettias were made red on christmas eve because a little girl brought baby jesus a weed for his birthday because she was so poor. the names, plot, and special saying that the little girl's brother said in the legend is not in this book, which takes away the impact of the story. the drawings although are beautiful and the story is nice if you don't know the real legend."
2,Didn't Know There Was Such a Strong Catholic Setting,"I was going to read this for the children's story in my church, but after reading the whole book I realized that it wouldn't work. The story is cute, but when it refers to mass and Father, it would have been too difficult to explain these things to children from an evangelical church in 5 minutes while also trying to get the main story across. It would have been too confusing for the preschoolers. I will donate it to our public library."
4,Great holiday book!,"Our favorite children's author is Tomie dePaola! We've added each of his books to our daughter's collection. This one is as wonderful as his others - great story, characters and helps the next generation understand tradition. Highly recommend!"
4,Good Quality BUT Loud,"Its a good shredder for the price, only bad thing is that it's very loud when in operation..."
5,These Are The Coolest People!,I saw this band live today at zetafest in miami and they were great. i met them after they played and they signed autographs and other stuff. They are really nice and arent like a lot of other bands out there. And they also sounded great live. I'm going to buy this cd!
5,Love it,"I first heard the song Burn on youtube years ago, and ever since then I have been looking for anything from this Band, and couldn't find anything of the sort, finally I found the CD and much to my pleasure, I like all the songs! It is very crisp and clear, came perfect from shipping! I was SO beyond pleased with this order!"
4,M.A.G.,"I first heard Mat At Gravity on Reign Of Fire quite some time ago. The movie featured ""Burn"" and ""Walk Away."" I was instantly hooked. Too bad few people have heard of the movie or this band. If you like Chevelle or Tool, you'll probably like this band."
1,Do Yourself a Favor and Stay Away!!!!!,"I really don't see anything good about this band. Sure the songs are sort of catchy and sort of good, but really there is no distinction between them and any other band. The guitar parts sound generic, the vocals average, and the lyrics get lost in the middle. I've seen this band live, as an opener for Jerry Cantrell and I was in a virtual hell living through 12 of these bland and uninteresting songs.Do yourself a favor and pick up the 30 Seconds to Mars CD - if you want to here originality, talent, soaring vocals, and some of the most melodiously crafted songs, all written by one man give that one your money. You won't be disappointed."
2,"careful, its not origional","I am amazed at these early 5 star reviews. There is an album called ""Make Yourself"" by Incubus. It did what a lot of bands are trying to do right now because they want in on the action. It frustrates me how this album mimics Hoobastank which mimics Incubus soo well. Are you guys eating the same food out there in CALI? Why the few stars?1. no creativity, the song structures are very simple and predictable.2. I found ""walk away"" to be magnificant acoustic and it pails as a studio track. Its a 3 star song while all the others are 2's and 1's.3. the lyrics are conversation and thoughtless...""check your intent"" ""would you laugh or would you fall to pieces?"" I think they are laughing at me for buying their album personally.4. there are better similar albums out there IMO that just came out! hint: audiovent, our lady peacebuy Faith No More first, then pick up the photo-copies.Sorry guys, I really wanted to like this CD, but I don't."
1,Careers for introverts are obviously very limited,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. There are only SEVEN careers mentioned!! Now, I KNOW there are more career choices than that for introverts. Plus, a few of the ones listed (writer, artist) are extremely difficult to make a decent living out of. Let me save you some money and time; the careers listed are writer, artist, freelance researcher, computer professional, security guard, forest ranger, and mail carrier. If none of these appeal to you, don't even bother with the book."
2,"too limited, disappointing","This book only gives a few limited ideas for careers and those careers are typically low-paying jobs. Maybe one is supposed to extrapolate other career ideas from the few listed. Several choices that I thought would be included are not even mentioned in passing, such as scientist & librarian. And some of the choices have a very narrow context. Artisan is a good idea, but there are very few places to do this.This book was very disappointing. Maybe someone else will write a better version."
4,Functional but not the best construction,"Having read about the lack of sturdiness in this product before hand, I am really careful when I use it and all is well. However, I wish the dividers were a little stiffer. This can be solved by keeping your shoes in the shoe boxes before putting them in the organizer though. It certainly works as a great under bed storage for my shoes though. I might get another!"
1,Pack size,"For anyone curious about the pack size of the tent, I emailed Eureka and was told 6"" x 24""I rate only 1 star b/c I have not purchased yet. Was waiting to learn the pack size."
2,warm weather only,Good light weight tent for backpacking. I like the two doors. But I was expecting a tent that was good for all seasons. My error. Good for summer but not advised for the winter months.
5,Excellent tent for backpacking; and holds up well in the rain!,"I got this tent when it was on sale for $80 through Amazon, and now having used it, I'd say it's worth the current $150 price.Unusual for an advertised three person tent, it will hold three persons. If you have three large adults with three large backpacks, it's going to be cramped, but bareable.It's very fast to set up and break down - seven or eight minutes with the fly. In good weather without the fly you get excellent ventilation.AND if it rains you are OK. Last night my ten year old and I were on a baseball field with a bunch of scouts, and got hit with a 45 minute downpour. It saturated the field and some people packed up and left. Despite no groundsheet and the fly not being staked out, we were bone dry.I would rate this an excellent backpacking tent for two or three people."
1,don't waste your time,"This film is like a poor middle school production. The lighting, acting, and writing were horrendous. The story of a boring man whose only claim to preaching is a literal and unenthusiastic interpretation. It is a stereotype of people who think they can read the Bible anyway they want to. I wouldn't bother showing this film -- if it can be called one -- to my dog. It would inspire a believer of Jesus to become an atheist. I would ask for my money back, but then I would have to let people who know my real name know that I purchased it. If you want true knowledge of the change Jesus can make in one's life, watch Benji."
4,fun when kids get a little older,"We purchased this to go with the Kettler swing set. It was fairly difficult to assemble, and I had to lie on the ground holding it on while my husband tightened the screws. But it is very sturdy and stable, and with two kids standing and swinging, I have no fears. Our child enjoyed the standard swings more at first, but then figured out that you can lie down and look up at the clouds, and swing lazily. A nice seat for parents watching the kids play too."
3,Pick the right size and they'll last with strong dogs,"I have a bull terrier. He loves balls and bowsers are the only ones that last more than a couple of hours.The 3"" balls are great for catching, but bullies can chew down on them an literally push one side into the other so you wind up with a half ball.The 4"" balls are softball size and are not easily caught or chewed because the dogs mouth is open wider and they don't bite down on them. My bully has taught himself to play soccer with them. He kicks & head butts them all over the yard and chases them for kilometres evey day. He's fit, but alas the ball is not. Today he soccered in into a fire. Bowser balls are not fire proof. I'm shopping for a few new ones today."
4,It made the cut!,"I bought one of these for my destructive Lab mix and was very shocked to see that it lasted more than 20 minutes. It's made of a very durable material and although it feels hard to me (I can't crush it with my hands), her jaws of steel can fold it almost in half BUT it's still in one piece and seems to be more puncture resistant than many of the KONG toys that boast how tough they are.With most toys, I end up having to put them away unless I am there to supervise but this is one that we can leave out and that's very unusual.I'm happy with it and we will be buying a few more of these to have around!!"
2,Not satisfied,"I gave it 2 stars as it lasted 2 days. I have a weim that LOVES to chew on balls. She was able to get into the seam of the ball the first day with her teeth, then destroy the seam the second and the ball was in two pieces. Thought it might have been a faulty seam, but she destroyed the second ball in 3 days. She only gets supervised ball chewing time for approx 1-2 hours a day. I would not buy again."
5,Bowser Balls are the Best!,"I have a 12 yr old Jack Russell and she is a ball obsessive and and a destroyer of all toys! She is in love with her bowser balls. She knows them when she sees the package! Nothing else compares to her and I have tried other balls. They last about 6 months of her squeezing the balls before they crack in half. She mopes around until I can order her another one. I also bought a larger softball size one for my pitbull neighbor and its his fav. too! If your dog is ocd with his/her toys and a destroyer of them as well, this is the ball for you!"
5,Great for heavy chewers,"My black lab used to destroy tennis balls, mangle nylon bones, actually ripped apart a rubber kong! At least these last about 6-12 months before she can get them to pop in half. She will just spend hours with these things. Great because they are light and you can throw inside and out without doing damage. Easy cleaned and well worth the money if you have a dog bent on ball destruction."
2,Kensington CD Cleaner Leaves Scratches On CDs,"The circular disc inside the unit that cleans the cd has a very thin and narrow strip of cloth attached to foam on it. Even the least amount of pressure when cleaning a cd will leave scratches on the cd. This is because the cloth/foam piece is easily pushed inside the plastic circle, and that plastic on the circle ends up touching the cd and scratching it while you are cleaning it. I recommend using cd cleaners that have wide and thick cleaning pads that cannot be pushed into the object holding it. I've also noticed that the wider pads clean the cds better and don't get dirty/worn out as quickly as the thin, narrow ones do. My personal favorite is the Scotch Disc Cleaner."
4,Great father/son project,"My son is very interested in World War history. This was a great opportunity to spend time and do something together; learn about the tank, how it was used in the war (info part of the package), learn to figure out the instructions and work together. The parts are standard and fit well. Instructions are fairly clear and parts are well labelled. With the various size of parts, this project is also great for developing fine motor skills."
3,CD is Disappointment,"I was disappointed in this CD because it's the same one sold under the covers of NASHVILLE and NASHVILLE COUNTRY DUETS. Emmylou Harris is not featured as much as the cover would indicate. Some songs are listed as Emmylou's voice but it's not HER ... it's Melba Montgomery. The tracks are not ""mixed"". Most are demos or rough cuts."
4,"Hey, it's when the tri-state had all representatives!","Don't listen to the other guy. This album was hot! The beats were off the hook! So many people used the beats on this album like they did on Ultramagnetic's Critical Beatdown that it ain't funny. The songs were hot also. Stezo on in the flow and lyric department was a different story. He was not the best MC, but he had good beats, hooks and songs. This is basically a classic album. I think it is out of print right now.Stezo is still making beats his beats are actually hot. I heard a story that says when Fresh Rcords was picked by Def Jam, Stezo gave Run (of Run-DMC) a hassle over a rdaio in a hotel room, so he did not get picked up. Whatever the case, he (I believe) has had the most success out of CT as a rapper, now they don't even want to hear us. We had a few: Skinny Boys, Stezo, Three the Hard Way, EPMD(yes,that is where Stezo came from) and TC Islam. I would like to know if there are some I forgot. Even I could not front on this album"
3,nice hip hop album old school,"There are some nice beats on this album. But most have been used before that. But if you listen to the album now it's nice to go back in time with some old school beats. I like the album, not great but nice."
2,The Black Sabbath Story,"I purchased this on VHS in 1992 (Released by Castle Communications PLC....2 X videos CAT No. SVO994 (55 minutes long) & CMP6070 (60 minutes long)) and the DVD is 85 minutes long??? - go figure, sounds like the DVD is just a rehash of the VHS with bits left out. This would be a great collectors item if it had full versions of the songs instead of small bites."
2,Could have been MUCH better....,"The stuff with DIO and IAN GILLAN kicks [butt]. Heaven and Hell, Mob Rules, Born Again, and Dehumanizer are great albums. Bad enough that the period between 1985 to 1991 was a weak period, BUT THEY ADD INSULT TO INJURY BY ONLY PLAYING THE LOVE BALLADS!!! THIS IS BLACK SABBATH??? C'mon now, there was SOME decent stuff from that time period...COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT, but they ruined this DVD. DO THE GUYS FROM SABBATH ACTUALLY APPROVE OF THIS STUFF BEFORE IT IS RELEASED?? ALSO, the DVD is NOWHERE near 85 minutes as claimed..."
1,dvd not working,"ive bought this 2 times from 2 different vendors and both were defective,they were listed as region 1 but obviously is not, really pisses me off to throw money away on bad product!"
2,How many people were in sabbath ?,"I just got this. I'm a huge Black Sabbath fan as well as a Dio fan. I thought there would be a lot of good stuff from that period.There was some, but not enough.Most of it was interviews from people I didn't know were in the band.Part 1 of the Black Sabbath story was awsome. This part falls far short."
1,Fake Widescreen,"The top and bottom of the picture are chopped off. Sometimes the tops of people's heads are missing, and sometimes they even compress the image so that it fits into the fake ""letterbox"" shape, so that everybody looks short, fat, and squished! Seriously, this is one of the worst instances of fake widescreen that I've ever seen."
3,"Black Sabbath - 'Black Sabbath Story,Volume Two' (Sanctuary Entertainment)","From viewing this DVD for the first time,I can NOW remember WHY I don't usually flip over that many DVD releases.I mean,this Story Of Black Sabbath is like a bad joke.It's got some good footage,but it should have had much more of Dio and Ian Gillan.Never cared for vocalist Tony Martin at all,but the clip here for ""Headless Cross"" isn't half bad.As for the songs performed with Dio,which were ""Die Young"",""Neon Knights"" and ""TV Crimes"",they should have completely edited the interview DURING the dang song!Those first two,I believe I saw them on Don Kirshner way back when.A total of 45 minutes of the music segment,plus several 'waste of time' extras.For Sabbath die-hards and completists only.Sure glad this DVD didn't cost me much."
5,Trying Times Made Me Think,"As the previous writer stated, the single Stand Still, is a powerful, incouraging, make-you-think type of song, that touches your spirit like never before. August 2003 was a trying month for me with personal issues going on in my life. I've restored my life with God, and I've acquired a lot of spiritual albums since then. This single, which was introduced to me in 1992, came back into my life as I prayed tonight. God gave me the direction to locate the album, now I will buy the album. It's a must have. You will not be disappointed."
3,Suspicious Similarities,"The bride is shot and killed coming out of the church by a sniper. Oddly enough, this is the same story as told by Ted Bell in his book ""Assassin"" when the bride of his character, Alex Hawke, is shot in exactly the same way when she stepped from her church in England.The similarities are too close for this to be a coincidence."
4,Love it!,"I read many reviews about this fountain and the two biggest complaints were that they were cheaply made and noisy. I've found neither of these to be true. Sure, it's plastic but it's ONLY $20! It was VERY easy to construct with simple directions, and I am all thumbs when it comes to assembly. The second complaint was that it's noisy, which if you keep it full of water when if used daily needs to be refilled daily, it is quiet and soothing. My husband even likes it! I've had this fountain for about a month now and if anything changes, then I will write another review. This is my first fountain but it won't be my last!"
2,had one long ago and it was better,"the newer version of this is not the same at all. cheaper plastic, noiser, splatters water on lowest setting. not impressed"
4,Nice little fountain,"I read the other reviews, which were mostly positive. Based on the negative reviews, I had some concern about the appearance of the fountain and the amount of noise it might make. After actually buying and setting it up, I am quite satisfied with the fountain. It is more solid-feeling than I expected, was easy to set up, runs quietly, and actually looks nice. The box included plenty of smooth rocks, which I have supplemented with some rocks and shells from the beach. As noted in other reviews, it is a one-sided fountain, i.e. it is intended to be viewed from one side-- this works quite well on a shelf or against a wall, but might not work so well on a table where it could be viewed from all sides. A couple of minor issues: to adjust the pump speed, you have to take out all the rocks and slates to reach the pump. And, I have not (yet) had to clean it, but again, will have to take everything out to do so. Overall, this purchase exceeded my expectations for the price."
1,Ugly,"I bought this fountian and I was very exited about having it. When I took it out of the box and had all of the peices it was obvious that it was cheaply made because one of the pieces was already broken. I finally glued it together and put it together and turned it on when I realized how loud the motor was. I left and came back about and hour later and there was water everywhere! The bottom level/slate thing splashes water out and there is a big puddle when it is done. Becuse of it constanly splashing water out, it runs out of water very quickly and needs to be refilled often. Another thing is that the light in the fountian dosn't have a seperate switch so if you want to go to bed with it on you have to have the light on while you are trying to go to sleep. I ended up completly taking the light out (which was a hassle) and with all of the other problems on top of that, I finally threw it out. I would strongly recomend finding a different product to buy instead of this one."
3,"Pretty, but loud.","This is a very cute rock fountain, however, the motor is so loud that you can barely hear the water trickling down the slats. Also, the stickers that they put on each piece to identify each one are very difficult to get off and I ended up scratching the plastic with my nails. It's also a bit of a pain in the *** to put together; the light kept sliding out of the holder.You get what you pay for."
5,Homedics water rocks,The product was exactly as described and the shipment came right on time. My granddaughter enjoyed this at her office cubicle. Used it to Feng-sui her space.
3,Not bad for the $$,"Pretty much what you would expect for $20. The tube insertion point on the pump cracked when I assembled it, but is still workable. The pump makes noises when first turned on, but if I turn it on and off a couple of times it goes quiet. So far, it's ok. Serves it's purpose as a soothing white noise generator."
1,Very Cheaply made :),"On my second set .. the first order, the motor broke within a week.. the second set has very cheap rock imitations ..I did not realize there is a cheap knock off version of this fountain and one that has actual black slate that slides into the sides.. Its no wonder the reviews are all over the place for this fountain.Not worth the price.. I found better water fountains at Walgreens :)"
2,Water Spills Outside the Fountain,"The fountain is very noisy, it makes an annoying whinning sound, the water spills onto the table no matter how I arrange the pebbles. Maybe it's just a defective unit. The black plastic doesn't bother me, but the noise and spills are deal breakers regardless of the affordable price."
3,Calming?,This fountain is lacking in rocks. Looks very cheap and plastic. Much improved with addition of small river rocks.
3,Nice but there are others which are better,"I bought this tabletop fountain at the same time I bought the Artesian Globe water fountain. Just to see if it was better than the globe design that I had had for 3 years. This one has a great picture and looks really cool. But it doesn't quite come out like the picture. My cat actually drank from this one, like she did the globe design, but this one had some problems. First, it splashed water all the time. Second, I had to add water to it every day. Third, putting it together was a new experience. And it is hard to get the base of the rock tower to sit perfectly into the bottom. I could never get mine to sit square on the bottom--it always tilted a little. A couple of times the cat was drinking from it and it toppled. It needs some kind of mechanism to hold the tower down to the base. This design was alright, but I really like the Artesian Globe design the best. I reviewed it as well. I probably would not purchase this design again."
2,The motor died quickly,"I gave it two stars instead of one because I though they made a decent fountain for the price. It wasn't noisy when I had it on the middle pump setting. Also, when positioned just right, it looked less cheap and flimsy.However, it's a little annoying to put together and a bunch of the rocks fall through to the bottom.If that was all I would have gave it three or possibly four for being decent while under $20. However, when the motor just flat out died in less than four weeks of only using it three hours a day, I got completely annoyed by the thing.I think they should have at least made the motor better."
3,fountain,This fountain is great for helping you relax and fall asleep at night. It is a little smaller than I expected but works so far. It's not made real well so I don't know how long it will last.
4,Inexpensive white noise maker,"This waterfall is an inexpensive white noise maker and functions very well. It's is noiseless as far as the pump is concerned. All I hear is the water. I have it positioned in the center of my apartment and can hear gentle water running from the kitchen, the dining room, or the living room. Exactly what I wanted."
4,I enjoyed this fountain.,"I bought this fountain hoping it will make my living room a bit more relaxing. I bought it back in December, and it's still running great. It didn't come with that many rocks, so the bottom you can see the plastic they sit on. So I went to the Dollar Store and bought some more, and the nice thing was that you can go anywhere and find matching rocks. You can tell when it needs more water because the pump will make a funny a grinding sound. What I really didn't like about it was that the platforms don't surround the entire fountain, only the front so there is a bare spot in the back and the water only falls from the front. I wanted a fountain where the water falls in all directions."
2,Too quiet,"This is supposed to be a relaxation fountain. In other words, it's supposed to emit the soothing sound of trickling water. There's the problem. Such little water flows through the fountain that I can't hear much of anything. Too bad; looks nice though."
3,Relaxing fountain,"The product is nice but I think the motor is broken, I can't change the speed of the motor and it is a little noisy. Can't be bothered to return it though."
1,"Hard to set up, cheap, noisy, and ugly!","I bought this from Wal-Mart and have not written a review yet - but I was so appalled at the low quality of this product that I had to write this to WARN POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS! Buy a better fountain, it'll be worth the money! This fountain is awful!I've put together a lot of things before and am fairly handy. This took over 30 minutes to set up, and it was very frustrating because the instructions were vague at best. However, I wanted to make sure I did it correctly, so I took my time to set it up properly. After all, there are plenty of warnings when you open the package that it has had noise issues, so you have to take the time to set it up properly.I did everything correctly and when it ran (full of water), it was VERY NOISY. Even following the warning labels to have it full of water before running it, it didn't work.Everything cheaply made. Not a dimensional product - can only be shown from one side. It looks cheap!! I threw it out the same day."
3,Gift,I bought this Relax Fountain as a birthday gift for my daughter.I have to assume she likes it. I hope so.
3,"Damaged, but OK","One piece was damaged when the box arrived, and the instructions were a little confusing to follow. Once I put it together, it was pleasing in the effect."
2,Pretty disappointed.,"I bought this fountain, having owned other fountains.This one is cheap, a huge pain to maintain & assemble, and the pump lasted less than 2 months, even when I maintained the water strictly by the instructions.Get something else. The only good thing about this fountain is the price."
3,Homedic Table Fountain,"I hope this one lasts. The other lasted 13 months... When it works, is very nice."
2,Not happy,The item looks great.It worked about two weeks and stopped.It seems the water pump failed.
2,save your money,"Overall, this product looks and feels quite cheap with plastic stone tiers and base. It was also a pain to put together as there were many pieces and they did not fit together well. Ironically enough putting together this ""relaxation fountain"" was probably the most frustrating thing I did all week. Really the only redeeming quality is that it looks nice lit up from a distance when the room is dark, and the sound of the water is nice, I suppose. Would not recommend."
4,It's nice.,"I got this for work - but decided to keep it at home. It's kind of loud - water splashing & the pump - but soothing, you eventually block it out."
2,whats with all the stickers,"spent 30 minutes getting the stickers off the base...why put stickers on everything...all that does is leave a mark on product...i have been using this for a couple days now and i decided to put this in my next garage sell...cheap,flimsy,water splatters everywhere...even on low speed...be smart and buy a better product then this one...you pay for what you get"
5,Lo mejor...,"Kairo ha evoluido muchisimo en este disco, ademas de nuevos integrantes trae musicas y coreografias mas actuales. esta muy padre, no dejen de comprarlo..."
5,A few minutes of play can be a lifetime of hell.,"This book was something else. The men in this book got exactly what they deserve. Darnell will realize that he should have stayed with his wife. Jake just totally messed up what he had. Stephan got what he deserved in the hotel. What looks real is not always real. As far as the ladies, don't tell your girlfriends what your man has and how he gives it to you. They will want some of the action too. Eric please hurry and start on another book. Your readers are waiting."
5,EXCELLENT,This is a great book! It's page turning drama. I recommend this book to everyone. Best book I've read all year.
