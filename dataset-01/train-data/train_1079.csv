2,expected more,Bought this to help me answer phones at work as I am hard of hearing. Worked better than the round amplifier that covers the hearing part of the phone but this device quickly showed it's limitations. To save battery it shuts off when there's silence. I have to listen to clients tell me about a problem and the device shuts off because I am not talking. Then I can't hear the customer talking either! Have to tap and fuss with it to turn it back on- often the customer is still talking during all this time I am trying to get it to turn back on. Turned out to be dangerous with customer relations as I often missed several differnet parts of the conversation.
2,Disapointing Results,I Bought this Telephone Amplifier as an aid to hearing conversation better.The sound level on my end was fine but not clear .The tone control was about useless. People on the other end of the phone could barely hear me. It was certainly a disappointing unit.I Had to return it.Thanks Amazon for your excellent return service.
2,Can Not Rate,"I was so excited to get this item. However, when it came we could not hook it up to the phone. The plug in (where the phone cord goes) was too small for the cord on my phone. We went looking all over for a cord that would fit. Ended up buying a new phone set. Then it didn't work. Wonder if it's because my phone line comes through my internet box."
2,It's useless product,I purshased this product for my mother...It give a loud buzzer when we put it in the lower volum for us to us the phone normally..... it sometimes gives the same buzzer when my mother use it... I tried a lot to catch when it do and when it work nicely but I failed.. It ends up with me disconnecting it from the phone and leave it aside.... I lost my money in this useless product
3,Experience,"It provides louder sound, but NOT clearence, I still cannot understand because words are NOT any clearer. Could that be improved?I bought this though Amazon.Vilnis"
1,Poor Advertising,This was not made known that you need phone that does not have buttons to dial out on receiver. So I am unable to use it until i can buy a new phone
1,Not Good for Most Modern Phones,This amplifier will not work with any phone that has dialing buttons on the handset. You don't find that out until you read the instructions that come with the phone. It should be mentioned in the product description. How many phones today don't have dialing buttons on the handset? I have 5 phones in my home and they all have buttons on the handset. I am returning this product to Amazon for a refund.
3,Hearing Impared,"This device has helped me to hear better on the phone, but I still have some trouble understanding people. A possable cause is the type of hearing defect. I am still trying different ways to use the device both with and without my hearing aids."
1,Misleading Specs,"Web site descriptions claim item works with most home phones. NOT true. Once you receive item and read instructions, you find out that the item will not work with phones where the keypad is in the handset. This is most phones now a days. So it doesn't work, and vendors want 20% restock fee and tracked shipping. You end up losing half the purchase price just to return it."
1,BEWARE,"Beware when you buy this item. It may work fine IF you plan to use it with a phone that DOES NOT have the keypad in the handset! The prod. spec states that it is compatible with most phones, and portable. Upon receiving the item and reading the fine print in the package, I found it not compatible with cordless phones. Prod specs DO NOT tell you that! Prod. specs are misleading. I will not buy anything from this seller again, due to their misleading info."
4,Number Pad,"I like this keypad. It arrived quickly. I guess there isn't a universal design, so this takes a little getting used to. I do wish there was an escape key."
4,Not too bad...,"This is a handy little device that makes number punching a lot easier on my laptop. The retractable cable leaves just enough cable on my table so that there is not a mess of extra to deal with. Also, packing this up to take to the library is effortless as the cable retracts in a flash and the device is quite slim.However, I have a few concerns with this product.-The rubber feet on this are quite hard, so they do not really cling all that well to some surfaces. If you were to use this exclusively for 10-key data entry, this may become very frustrating as it slides around a little.-When used for the first time after my laptop hibernates, the first button I punch often does not register. This is sometime hard to keep in mind which is minimally frustrating."
3,Not for MacBook Pro extension...,"Ok, here's the deal, I got this thing hoping I could use it to expand my ability to use shortcuts in Pro Tools. While the unit types numbers fine--great if all you're doing is data entry--but the keys seem to be assigned differently. It DID NOT WORK with Pro Tools unfortunately. Se la vie I guess. Back to right clicking."
3,Look's good.,If you want a cool looking gun but don't want to paint it. The stickers are a good choice.But you are going to spend a few time putting it on.It also does not stick very well... Even after removing all the oil with a grease remover...
3,Battery on time,"Havent had a chance to actually use the battery yet, Im in Afghanistan and it was sent to SC awaiting my arrival however, the service was speedy and prompt,I was truly impressed, looking forward to continue doing business with that of Amazon they saved me money and cut out that of the middle man. thankyou for being there when I needed you the most!"
3,Cute outfit--poor shipment,"This is a mixed review: Though the packaged came ontime as ordered (paid extra for fast shipping), and the outfit fits well and looks good, was annoyed in the seller's packaging/shipment methods and misleading product descripton. On website, the Product Description claimed the costume comes with the glasses--not true. Mine just came with the outfit and wand. As for the shipping, they just put the costume in a box without padding, so the wand came in pieces. Normally would've returned the product and request the refund, but I received the package on Oct 27 and there's no guarantee I would've gotten another outfit shipped to me on time by Sat. Had to go look for another wand and glasses at other Halloween costume stores in the area to complete the outfit, which defeated the purpose of looking/buying online to begin with. But still, the costume itself was cute, and I'm pleased with that at least."
4,cute costumes for a great price,"i ordered 2 of these for the HP7 preview and they are pretty cute... A little big for a small it didnt fit as tight as i'd have liked and it gaped around the chest on me so my bra stuck out but it fit my friend better as she is more curvey and more like a medium.Great value and shipped fast, definitely worth it!"
5,Great Costume-very low cut though,"Pretty much what you see is what you get. The front cut is really low, so if you have a smaller bust, you'll need some sort of undershirt (it literally grazes the nipples of the average 34b). Also, sized larger. My size small will need to be pinned to fit snug like the picture. Wand, cape and glasses are a really cute touch."
5,"broken wand, but quickly brought replacement","It was a very good costume. Though wand was broken, a replacement was shipped very quickly."
5,Great Costume!,I received my costume really fast and it was exactly what I wanted. Very sexy costume and I got lots of compliments.
4,et tu brute?,"This is a book that i have recently finished for the first time reading all the way through. It asks compelling questions through the thoughts and converstations between the main characters and their wives. It also relates to current political parties battling for control of the governtment with a 3rd side party also involved. There are also many ironic and suspenseful moments that kepp you reading evan if you are not reading it for study. Over all, I find it a great novel, but it is not something that I would read again for a long while; but possibly see the play acted out or watch a telivision form."
1,Pathetic!!,Am I the only one that hates this book? God! I hate this book! It gets boring soooooooooooooooooooooo fast! They're a lot of books to find better than Julius Caesar. Rather read about Lady GaGa instead. She's the best artist ever!!!@Porphyrogenita Nope
3,Strange but Odd......Unique offering,To be honest just purchased for one song. After hearing the Cd still just like the one song as so odd and interesting of a composition.So that's it....take your chances. Probably a hard CD to keep finding as the years move on. Hopefully not a one hit wonder........
5,"An economics ""thriller"" to the highest order.","Certainly the best book I've read in recent years on the reasons behind Asia's economic successes and potential pitfalls. This book reads like a ""thriller"". He whets your appetite with his prologue, and after that, as they say you can't put the book down. The difference with Rohwer is that he has remove as much of the ""mumbo-jumbo of economics"" and written a down to earth, honest and easily understandable book for Asia watchers"
4,Great low budget movie,"This movie is a great movie for a low budget movie. With availability of lower price super computers, the gap between big mega blockbusters and movies made by smaller groups is getting smaller."
4,A futuristic look at outsourcing,An incredible story about a boy and his roots. A new look at cheap labor. A thought provoking chilling look at a near future.
1,ALL IN SPANISH !!!,"I ORDERED THIS MOVIE B/C IT SOUNDED INTERESTING, BUT WHAT I RECEIVED WAS A MOVIE IN WHICH THE JACKET COVER (FRONT & BACK) WAS ENTIRELY IN SPANISH !"
4,Intriguing political sci fi,"With water rights being purchased by private companies all over the world, this film could not be more timely. Sleep Dealer has a gorgeous color palette, great performances, excellent production design, and an intriguing premise: the US wants work accomplished, without workers. Now, they can have this. Workers operate all kinds of equipment via remote control. Memo has left his father's milpa, since the dam charges them more for water than they can afford for irrigation. He gets involved with a lovely woman, whose secret is that she's selling other people's memories as her own writing. Memo, meanwhile, searches for the soldier who killed his father (also by remote control). I see great things in this director's future."
4,Bravo to Edward Albee! Brilliant!,"These plays are highly thought provoking and flow very well. Both have odd plots that keep you interested. The obviously stronger of the two, The Zoo Story, combines comedy with drama in a very interesting way. Only four stars because reading the play does not substitute for seeing the play's production with all the interaction."
3,"Second in the ""Sue Barton"" series","This book covers Sue Barton's final year in nursing school. During this time, Sue trains in the operating room, works in a maternity hospital, and serves as a student head nurse. She is devoted to learning her career, but when young Dr. Bill Barry asks her to marry him, she faces a conflict. She wants to say yes, but she also wants to work as a nurse first. How will Sue resolve this issue?This was a decent story. I'm afraid that I didn't find Sue's interlude in the operating room that interesting, (apparently, neither did Sue, for she decides against surgical nursing); but things start to perk up with the Christmas Eve dance, Sue's sojourn at the maternity hospital, and her turn as a head nurse where she comes up against an ethical dilemma, (should she report a flirtatious student nurse who neglects her work -- a course of action which might label Sue herself a ""squealer""?). Sue's graduation night provides a fitting conclusion."
3,Brilliant debut,"Wonderful album by Sara Evans very consistent song choices. Highlights: True Lies, Shame about that, and Even now. Lowlights: none."
2,Too traditional for me,"The only song I like in this album is ""Three Chords and the Truth."" I burned it onto a CD and then sold the album back to the store.I gave this album many chances. I listened to it many times, but I never warmed up to the songs. It then occured to me that the songs were too traditional for my taste, which I discovered was more contemporary. That was the reason why the only song I liked was ""Three Chords and the Truth"" - because that was the only contemporary song on the album.The traditional country music fan may find a liking to this album because as a contemporary country music fan, I didn't."
4,Mustela Hydrant Bebe Face Lotion,"The lotion has the same smell as the Mustela baby body wash. I tried it on my face, it's not thick, very easy to absorb, but I feel it is a little dry, just a little. Also, the perfume is strong and it lingers on for a good few hours. I wish the manufacture can make perfume free products. Overall I think it's ok, I would give it 3.5 stars."
5,Love this!,"My baby has really dry skin and this face lotion really does hydrate her well. Now she has non of the flaky skin and helps clear up her skin rashes too! On top of that, she smells wonderful."
5,great moisturizer,"I love this moisturizer and have been using it on my baby since we brought her home from the hospital I use it twice a day and keeps her skin moisturized, no break outs and has a healthy glow to it."
1,disappointed,After reading several reviews I purchased this facial cream for my 1 and 2 yr. olds who both have sensitive skin. The amount of perfume in the cream was suprising to me and do not feel comfortable using it on their faces. I do like the texture butnot all of the chemicals
2,Allergy,"It is too much fragrant, and too much water. It could not protect baby' skin especially in winter. Allergy to my son."
3,"Love the scent, but doesn't really moisturize during winter","My daughter has a very dry face during the winter.When I apply this on her, when she has a really dried skin, it stings she says.I love the scent, but doesn't really do the trick during the winter times.Perhaps a good product during summer."
2,Didn't work for my son,"My son had a little rash/maybe some eczema on his face. I used this for a couple days and it got worse. I bought some Weleda brand Calendula cream for his face, and it instantly got better. I now use the calendula cream twice a day and his skin on his face has been great ever since I started using it three months ago."
4,"A Canadian Joan Armatrading, Great stuff!","I first heard Ms. Smith on World Cafe and searched the store till I found her CD. After listening to it a few times, I continue to enjoy her original lyrics and songs, and I still hear the same quality or depth I hear in Armatrading or even Tracy Chapman."
4,I'm looking for the light,"Lanegan's tribute to his roots follows the successful template of his solo albums: spare acoustics, tastefully brushed drums, moody flourishes of vibes and the occasional reverbed electric guitar stitched lovingly and intoxicatingly through songs by ...Buck Owens? It works, trust me, it works.Boasting a superb song selection that covers everything from traditional folk songs to soul chestnuts to re-wired punk, Lanegan and company craft a moody, smokey, ultimately satisfying cover album that -- like the most comfortable beds -- sounds slept in."
3,A Little Sentimental,"I bought this album because I really liked Scraps at Midnight, which was so good and dark. I was kind of disappointed by I'll Take Care of You, though, it was kind of less consistent in tone, and the songs were a little more sentimental and less satisfyingly growly. So I only ended up listening to the album a few times before stowing it on the shelf where it will be gathering dust until the next time I'm culling my CD collection."
5,I've been looking for a product like this. ...,"I've been looking for a product like this. I've just recently been able to keep my nails at a nice long length and I love the look of a French manicure. But I'm really terrible at doing it nicely myself! (And the salon is too expensive for a weekly thing.) These guides were so helpful that no one at work could tell that I did it! Plus, with the two different styles I could be very creative!"
3,Decent,"I used these and got mixed results. Some nails looked great. Other nails looked 'messy' with nail polish that wasn't even. A real French manicure is best, but if you don't have the time or money, these will do."
3,I found the Sally Hansen French Manicure Guides ...,I found the Sally Hansen French Manicure Guides to be very helpful. They allowed me to polish my nails getting a clean professional look. They were very easy to use with little mess or clean up.
2,Not Happy,"These do not work, after you put on the polish and you go to remove these guides it either smears or leaves a ridge, I ended up appling the polish free hand and they look like I had them done professionally."
4,Bike cube,"Excellent for bike supply storage and travel. Easily organizes helmet, gloves, glasses, shoes etc. Would be nice if it had a clothing storage area for extra clothes."
2,Spacing problems ruin the rhythm,"I bought the $4 kindle edition instead of the 99 cent one, thinking it would have corrected the spacing problems of the earlier version. I also assumed, incorrectly, that the book would contain a selection of poems and a table of contents. I was sorely disappointed to find only two poems, with the lines run together. I'm a kindle fan, but in this case, I recommend a paper version."
1,Find a better edition,"If you are looking for the title poem, or just some poems by Eliot, avoid this edition. There are 28 pages of print and ten completely blank pages beyond that, an obvious attempt to pad an already slim edition. Besides the blank pages ... the dimensions (height, width) are oversized, leaving way too much blank space in the pages with print. This is simply discraceful. Find these same poems in an edition by a responsible publisher."
4,A Magnificent Scholarly Achievement,"Professor Schneer has done an outstanding job in emphasizing the dominance of Great Britain in the first year of the twentieth century. And he has been able to convey that dominance through a profile of significant events that occurred at the heart of the largest empire in history. ""The Sun Never Sets on the British Empire,"" so goes the quote to phrase the period and one can see how expansive that empire is by studying this book. This is, however, a very scholarly book and may not be suitable to the ""armchair anglophile"" or beginning historian. It helps to have a basis of British history before reading this book."
4,Trapped author makes a masterful escape,"I think the ""Golden Age"" books are a tremendous work, and I am eager to see what this author produces next. In some ways the conclusion to the series was not nearly as good as the lead up in books 1 and 2 were, but he ties it up nicely in the end.In general the actual ""bad guys"" were a bit of a let down, and in true Captain Kirk style the main character nearly talks it to death. It proves the old axiom that any intelligent space faring species can be annoyed and bored to the point where it would rather die than let you go on.The most enjoyable aspects were the activities of Atkins, the resolution of the ""crazy old man at the beginning of the book"" bit (very well done!) and the penultimate ending sequence. Again I would have rather had the might engineering guy driving the starship have to be a lot more inventive when facing a technologically superior enemy (thinking on his feet) than what happened, but the author did a great job of wrapping this up."
1,Boring,"Too esoteric, even for a sci-fi lover. The jargon and characterization is so dense and bizarre in the early pages that I could not finish this book."
2,"jeeze, enough already","I enjoyed the Golden Age, but by the end, the main character had begun to knaw at me a little. By two books later at the end of The Golden Transcendence, I was so sick of the pompous bastard that I almost threw the book away.What began as an interesting universe and a mystery to solve,descended into a maze of endless shells of lies and deception. The apparent solution to the mysteries that began this whole saga was revealed, proven wrong, and re-revealed so many times that i just didn't care anymore. It was the this faction, no it was this faction, no it was this faction controlling that faction... on and on... Whatever."
2,This was a disappoint for my husband,"My husband enjoys reading type of books like this, but he did not like the story to continue reading it."
5,This is a great product,"I purchased 2 of these. My plan was to mount 4 monitors in a square. Originally I was going to just mount the two poles close together and use one for the upper two monitors and one for the lower two monitors. I have a corner computer desk with a hutch that has a top shelf in the middle. So, what I did was cut one pole and attach the two poles so they fit snug between the desk top and the bottom of the top hutch shelf then bolted the top and bottom through the wood to create a taller very firm pole. Then I installed the two arms on the pole with the lower arm holding (2) 22"" monitors and the top arm holding the other (2) 22"" monitors. It works very well as I can easly adjust each monitor to face directly to where I sit."
3,LCD Dual Desk Mount,Everything shipped according to schedule. Received with in 10 days. Good product if you can get it in one place so that you do not have to move it up and down.
3,CCNA(R) Router and Switch eSIM,"The main reason I obtained the product was because purchasing 5 routers and three switches was out of the question. The three simulated network scenarios were a good way to get ""seat time."" The simulation scenarios do have some bugs and some limitations. I was very pleasantly surprised with the 120 e-Lab activities, 200 CCNA flashcard questions, and especially the video lessons on CD2. CD2 was worth the price of the product. In addition to this simulation software, I used Odom's CCNA Cert Guide (2nd Ed). OBTW...I passed the test with a 978."
3,Buggy Software,"I just bought this software and it seemed perfect to practice with routers and switches, but the scenarios don't save well, the computers reboots, the serial interfaces don't get up. I have requested the patches for the 3 scenarios, I hope to receive them soon.These problems appears with Windows 98. I tested on Windows Xp machines, and the scenarios saved ok."
3,Clever...but not too terribly clever,"This book is a great thing to have at parties and campfires. The littany of ""if"" questions can keep you in conversation for hours. However, I feel that the author could have spent more time creating questions that were a little more unique. I also felt that the retail price was a bit expensive. Other than a few minor caveats, ""If"" can be an asset to any social setting. In addition, some of the questions can be adult in nature so it is probably not wise to put it in the hands of a child."
1,Very Disappointed,"This was a gift for my eight year old daugter for christmas. When we attempted to use the camera, we thought it was broke, and returned it to the store only to be disappointed again with the new one. The picture is very hard to capture, and they are unclear and grainy. The pictures on the box misrepresent this item. Do not recommend wasting your money."
2,Pixter Camara,This looked so cool and how excited my my 3 yr old. It really is hard to use. Takes time to get the picture in view and the picture quality is poor. Wouldn't recommend getting this.
1,Should be rated lower than 1 star,"DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS TOY! I thought this would be a great addition to my daughter's pixter games. Big mistake! The pictures are only bearly visible in really high level lighting situations. Forget taking pictures in average indoor settings. Grainy, dark, and distorted. Did the manufacturer even test this product? I'd rate it overall a ZERO!PITIFUL!"
1,Worst camera of all time,"How does a company even release something that does not work. This is the biggest piece of junk ever.Pixter was cool, camera is garbage."
1,I wish I could give it a Zero. Do not buy this piece of junk!,I just purchased this camera for my son's Pixter. I cannot believe that Fisher Price actually decided they should sell this thing. If they tested it at all they had to have noticed that the pictures are absolutely terrible. This thing is absolutely worthless. The only way we could get something even close to a photo to show up was to place it in extreme light. Even then the quality was terrible. This camera has to go back to Walmart. Don't even waste the money if you see this item on clearance. It isn't worth $5.00! Shame on Fisher-Price for abusing parents (and children)in this manner.
1,Needs Improvement,"This accessory was the reason we decided to get our son the color pixter. While the color pixter has been a great success, this camera has been a huge disappointment. The camera does not take pictures with any clarity at all. The only thing you see is grains. This camera is a great idea, but at this point an awful product. Needs a lot of improvement."
1,Don't buy this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bought this for my 10 yr. old's birthday. What a major disappointment ! The images are awful. You can only get a relatively decent (though grainy) image if you're ""photographing"" something right under a lamp. Images in lighted rooms are dark brown/ maroon. You can't make anything out. I called the mfr. about it and they had me calibrate the pixter. This did nothing to improve image quality. It was then thought to be a defective product destined to be exchanged. Having now read the prior reviews, I'll just return it altogether."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"I BOUGHT THE PIXTER DIGITAL CAMERA FOR MY DAUGHTER'S PIXTER COLOR. IT IS AWFUL. ALL YOU CAN SEE IS FUZZY IMAGES. THE PICTURES ON THE PACKAGE WERE DEFINITELY NOT TAKEN WITH THE PIXTER CAMERA. GREAT IDEA, BUT THEY NEED TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS PRODUCT. IF YOU DO BUY IT, KEEP YOU RECIEPT!!! I'M GLAD I DID."
1,0 stars!,"We love the Pixter products. My son was so excited to see the camera come out. We bought it at Christmas. It was so crappy that I thought it was damaged. So, I swapped it out for another one. When I realized it was the product, my son was very upset. I took it back also and just bought him another cartridge. Why are they even selling these pieces of crap???"
1,What was Fisher-Price thinking?,If I could have rated the Pixter Digital Camera 0 stars I would have. The Pixter has been a huge hit with my 8 year old granddaughter since Christmas and I thought the digital camera addition would be great. Wrong. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased it. My granddaughter is now seriously doubting the integrity of the Easter Bunny. I'm glad I didn't have to take credit for it! This piece of poo is going back where it came from.
1,"A ""wanna-be"" digital camera",Listen to all the previous reviews on this product. It is nothing like the advertisements. It simply does NOT function properly! It is a total waste of money.
1,Stinks,Don't waste your money!!!!!!All you see is a dark image and you can't even tell what you are looking at!!!!!! I can't wait to return it!
1,Absolutely terrible,"I am appalled that the manufacturer released this. We bought the camera attachment for our 7 year old at Christmas to go with the Color Pixter we had also got. On Christmas Day we thought we had a broken unit because it was impossible to get a picture where you could tell what you were looking at. We got a replacement unit, and just tried it again. Not only is the picture quality so awful that it's not worth looking at, the instructions provided for changing contrast don't even match what the ""camera"" does. This is an absolute disgrace. I know there are plenty of reviews already slamming this product (wish I would have read them first!), but I had to add my two pennies because I don't think I have ever been this disappointed with a purchase for one of the kids."
3,Disappointed,The camera does not take quality pictures. My daughter was disappointed when she couldn't take pictures of her family without placing the image underneath a really bright light. It took the fun out of it. I will say that after we captured an image (minutes later) it was fun to decorate the faces. I would NOT buy this again or recommend it to a friend. Thumbs down!
2,You get what you pay for!,"I empathize with all the negative reviewers of the Pixter camera even though my experience isn't quite THAT bad, although I WILL say that it isn't ""all that"" either. There is a way to adjust for lighting. It's not perfection by any means, but it helps a little. I can clearly see the images in the screen HOWEVER I will say that it is nowhere near what is portrayed on the box and in tv ads.I didn't expect an Olympus quality camera for $20, so I guess that's not why I'm so freaked out by the quality. You get what you pay for.I also find it difficult to keep an image in the screen and then have to touch the screen with the stylus to take a picture...awkward at best.Would I purchase this again? For $20 because it's what my daughter wanted, probably. Would I recommend to others? Eh, not really."
1,What a waste!,"This product should be taken off the market. It is awful. Don't waste your money. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased it. Why isn't there an option for zero stars on the reviews? That's what this deserves - a big, fat zero."
1,The worst attachment for Pixter!,We also bought this for our daughters Pixter because they love to take picture with our camera. The pictures were very fuzzy and dark even in a well lit room. Luckily my girls were so pre-occupied with all of their other toys I was able to place it back in its box for return. I am amazed that Pixter/Fischer Price actually sold such a poor product.
1,"Pixter Camera Is Like The Whammy Burger In ""Falling Down""","In the picture it's plump, juicy and three inches thick. In your kid's hands its a sorry miserable squashed thing. The whole purpose of getting the Pixter was to enjoy the camera functionality, yet all it delivered was grainy dark images that are 1000 times worse than any throw away camera you might use.I cannot stress enough that you might as well throw your money away rather than buy this pathetic excuse for a kid's toy."
1,Garbage!!!!!,This is the worst purchase I have ever made!! This camera takes horrible pictures. Out of the 25 to 30 pictures that my daughter has taken I have only been able to recognize 3 objects because the clarity of the photos are so bad (pictures on packaging are not reflective of actual pictures). I thought by adjusting the contrast that the pictures would come out more clear but; 1.) it did not help and 2.) I a 36 year old man with plenty of experience working on electronic equipment was unable to work the contrast bar without threatening to slam the toy into the ground! The color Pixter is an improvement over the old mono-color style but would stay far away from the camera!
1,Do NOT buy this product!!!,"What a disappointment! When I purchased this, there had been no reviews yet. I have to say that I agree with every single review written to date. The picture is dark, impossible to see, and changing the contrast and calibrating makes absolutely no difference. Don't waste your money or time purchasing this piece of garbage. If you already have purchased it for Christmas, exchange it now! (I tried leaving ""no stars"", but the rating system wouldn't accept it!)."
1,Should have come here first,"I typically read reviews here before I buy toys, but we have been so happy with our color Pixter and all the games that go with it that it never occurred to me that the digital camera would be any different. I could not have been more wrong. This is a horrible product. Others have already said why, I just wanted to second them all. If you are not convinced about how awful it works and still want to try it, buy one used off ebay - there are sure to be dozens from disappointed users."
1,Does not work with all systems,FYI Doesn't work with the multi-media pixter. I was told by Fisher Price that the camera was the ONLY item that doesn't work on the Multi-media. Bummer...that's one reason we got the whole thing.
2,The rumors are true...Ashley's review,"If you are thinking about buying this product, I'm warning you now not to buy this piece of crap. I bought this on February 26, 2005 (which was my 13th birthday), and it did work better than the reviewers said....for a month, that is. The other day I wanted to use the Pixter Camera, and it worked for two minutes and then the original Pixter starting screen and theme song went over it!!!!! Plus, some of the pictures are clear, but they're really dark. I mean, despite the reviews I had read, I didn't expect high quality pictures with that thing, but I also didn't expect to be writing a bad review on the product a month later after it stopped working right, either. Parents, don't waste your hard-earned cash on this worthless piece of crap. Get them an iZone mini instant camera instead. They'll be just as happy."
1,PIXTER CAMERA IS NO FUN,I purchased the Pixter Digital Camera for my daughter. She loves to play with my digital camera and I thought it would be a great way to keep her happy and my camera safe. But the Pixter camera proved to be a huge disappointment. The picture images are nothing like the ones they show in the TV ads. In fact its nearlyimpossible to see an image. Forget about indoor pictures. You can't see anything. Outdoor pictures are not much better. I called the company and they agreed the pictures are not like the ones in the ad. They promised to send a guide to getting better images which I still have not received. This product is a dud and a total waste of money. If I could I would rate this a big zero.
1,Do you own a 1000 watt bulb?,"We love our Pixter and have several games. But, I bought this and returned it before my son ever saw it. I can't believe they even approved this for production. If you have a photography studio in your house then this is the perfect purchase for you. There is not enough light provided inside the home for this to work. There is a reason that cameras have flashes. It didn't even work a little bit. I couldn't make out any of the images I tried to take. It was all a gray blur. I am sure it would work outside but my kids aren't playing with this kind of a toy when they are outside."
1,Disappointed,"We bought this camera for our son for Christmas. He is seven, so he thinks it is cool, but to be honest, you can not even see the pictures that he takes. Just slight images. I agree with the other review. It seems really cool and your kids will beg, but I'd wait until something else comes out that is better. This was the whole reason why we purchased the Pixter color so he could have the digital camera...$145. later...."
1,A terrible purchase,"The product preview done by Fisher Price is totally misleading, and in our opinion very dishonest. The product works NOTHING like the preview/commercials. If you can even see an image of the picture you are trying to take on the screen, it is very dark and distorted. A very diappointed little girl (and parents) on Christmas morning! Santa will be taking this one back to the workshop. I agree with the most recent reviewer. Zero stars would be too high of a rating for this toy."
1,FALSELY ADVERTISED!!!,"This toy takes AWFUL pictures! They are NOTHING like the ads show. They are very dark and objects are completely unrecognizable! I agree with all the other reviews- DON'T WASTE YOUR $, as you will want to return it immediately, as am going to do ASAP! A complete disappointment, as the commercials make it look so cool!! I also tried to leave zero stars- one is giving it too much credit!!"
1,What a dreadful suprise!!!,"When I bought this camera, my son wanted it so bad. It was one of his main gifts for Xmas...pixter and all. Well, at first I thought it was broken because youcan't see a single image on the screen and from the box you think your images are going to come out perfect!! Well, he is so disappointed he won't even touch his pixter, he thinks the camera is broke and wants me to take it back and get him a new one...no way am I getting this thing again!! I am taking it back and just buying him a real camera. Don't know if I will keep the pixter or not...hopefully he will play with it after the camera goes back! THIS IS A TRUE WASTE OF MONEY AND SO UPSETTING TO A CHILD."
1,weak,"this was the worst toy ever! when you take pics in light, the screen is just white! when you take pics in the dark, the screen is black! you cannot tell what you took a picture of!anyway, i'm returning this for an arcade pixter game!I hope they come out with a better camera!DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,Waste of money!,"I purchased this digital camera for my son who loves to take pictures... he loves his Pixter Color so I thought it was a great idea...however, it stinks! The image shows up very dark and blurry. You can hardly make out what the image is. Don't waste your money...this product is definetely not worth it."
1,Why oh why didn't I read the reviews?,"I rushed out yesterday and went to a store 50 miles away to find this product, and what a waste of gas, time, and money. My 5 year old son had asked for this for his birthday, which was today. He hasn't tried this out yet; he went to sleep on the way home from Chuck E. Cheese's, and will probably sleep all night. I tried this out for him, so that I would know how to help him with it in the morning after he awakes. He is really going to be disappointed. We will try outside photos after daylight, but I'm probably going to return this and get him a real camera, and maybe a different Color Learning software cartridge for the Pixter, (which actually IS a great product). What a shame that Fisher-Price dropped the ball on this one."
1,Don't dissapoint your child with this product!,"My daughters, ages 4 and 9 love their Pixters. I saw the advertisement for the digital camera and thought it looked like fun. I ordered two and when they arrived just before Christmas opened them to make sure they worked alright. At first I thought they were broken... then discovered they dont even work on the multi-media pixter which my oldest daughter has. On the Color Pixter it is so hard to get a visible picture. So now that we are stuck with these our challenge is to see if we can get a picture that looks like something you took a picture of. My intention was to give these to my daughters as Christmas presents and I'm glad I didn't."
1,Not worth the price,"I am a preschool teacher at a local daycare. I happen to have a habit of buying toys for my ""children"" and let them play with the toys. I bought the color pixter (which by the way is educational and fun at the same time). I spent the $30 for the digital camera and was VERY disappointed that you can only create a picture if there is a tonof light. Basically, the sun has to be the background. Overall, this is the only pixter item that I or the children did not have fun with."
1,"Don't buy this ""camera""!","Don't waste your money! The difference between the advertisement pictures and the actual output is day and night! By that, I mean it looks like the advertisement pictures were taken in the day and the actual output looks like it was taken at night... with the pixter covered with a thick canvas bag.Do not buy this ""product"" it ruined my daughter's Christmas!!!!!Gary L."
1,Good Idea......but,"I have 2 children who love their color pixters. I thought the camera was a great idea. It's difficult to get a decent image while indoors. We were all pretty disappointed and my children do not use it, even though they do use the pixters and other cartridges. If they improve upon this product it would be good, otherwise, don't waste your money."
2,Forgettable...unfortunately.,"Wow, what a shame. Coming off the creative high of Puppet Master, I expected something equally varied and creative. Its hard to believe this is Mike Weed and the rest of the crew. I waited a while to review so that I could maybe begin to give a crap about this release, but no such luck.The music and vocals are just...well, boring. Yeah, there's a lot of technical guitar wizardry, but so what? Its rather aimless and meandering. King is up to the same old routine as well. Puppet Master was fresh, varied, musically interesting, and well balanced. This is just...its just forgettable...and I really wish that were not the case. But so be it."
3,Creepy As Hell . . .,"I was lucky enough to get this new CD a day early, and I haven't stopped listening to it since. The guitar work is incredible and the story is scarry as hell! I think that King Diamond has finally got a solid line up that willl work for him."
5,The best yet!,"Hands down the best KD yet. If you lean to the darker catchier King with choruses and such, this is the one for you. By far my fav King Diamond CD."
5,A VERY SOLID METAL ALBUM,"I personally found this new KD recording after one listen to be solid, no filler and true METAL (as he always did). Some of KING's previous releases left me feeling ""MEH"" but this one does not disappoint at all.TRACK #1 is just some spooky intro like KING usually starts at the beginning of every album of his but TRACK #2 is a powerful and solid opener. My favorite is the last track entitled ""MOVING ON"" which offers melody and atmosphere. This album was pretty steady throughout from beginning to end with power and melody, excellent guitar work.If you have always been a KD fan since the 80's, you should not be disappointed."
4,enter the bankers' world!,"What did I know about banks before? A little! But since I read this book, I knew more about banks and the dillemas they face amidst the ordinary revolution of this naive world. It offers a view of a collapsing realm of economy, that which holds the blood line of society. Good!"
4,Kenny G-The Greatest Holiday Classics,"Overall, this is not Kenny G's best Christmas album. It is classic Kenny G in his styling and what he does with melodies."
4,Great gift for the holidays!,"I love the Kenny G ""Miracles"" CD, so ordered this one to go with a ""CD gift basket"" I was giving someone for Christmas. It is good, but nothing will compare to the ""Miracles"" CD. Was delivered quickly and packaged well."
1,endless and meaningless,"I am a hardcore jazz fan and i heard a lot of friendsof mine(non-musicians) saying they liked Kenny G, so ihad to know what it was all about.I find that he plays very relaxing ""music"" with a pop sound(he sometimes sounds like the music of an x-rated movie), but he has no inspiration , no senseof intensity , no drive , a very poor rhythmic sense , and ridiculous harmonic choices .In fact he is just ""filling the blanks"" , and he is totally unable to interest anyone who has played music for more than a month.The challenge with smooth music is that even though you are smooth you need to communicate rather than to repeat endlessly those little cliches that Kenny like so much.If you like him i urge you to try to find a music that really ""says something"" , not necessairly jazz , because music is about communication , not background noise(and I really mean NOISE)."
1,Have Yourself a Kenny LITTLE Christmas,"Some folks love jazz, others love pop, others love easy listening... play this CD and you will see something very rare ... all 3 types of real music lovers agreeing on how irritating this little man is musically. In each case, his strange rambling and convoluted notes weave a tapestry of destruction within every bar of music. This is totally tasteless holiday fluff."
4,Great holiday album.,"Kenny G is amazing, and it's great to have his greatest holiday classics all on one album."
1,No study guide questions,This description says it contains study guide questions...it does not. I'll be asking for my money back.
5,Love this series,I bought the books for my best friends daughter. I loved them as a kid and was very happy to find them again to pass on the story
5,Good read,"Following right where they left off, Wonder is flying through her training once she gets the right handling. I think alot of horse people out there can relate with ashleigh about the frustration of watching someone push a horse to far but we can also relate with her never giving up. Good read, reccomend for any horse lover."
5,wrong,"''This is to the Julia person who is dumb enough to think that Townsend Prince and Ashleigh's Wonder aren't half siblings. The Prince and Wonder ARE half siblings. The have to have the same SIRE and a different dam, NOT the other way around. You don't know the first thing about horses. YOU ARE HORSE STUPID!!!''To the poster who posted this, that was completely wrong. The original poster was right: horses are half-siblings if they have the same dam and different sire. If we go by your theory, then 70% of thoroughbreds today are related to each other, because of the Northern Dancer in their lines. Do some research."
5,If you love horses this is the book for you!,I thought Thouorghbred book number 3 was awesome. I would defenately buy it. If you love horses and horse racing this would be the book for you. It's about a girl who helps train a horse to win the Kentucky Derby. Wonder is a super cool horse who has alot of spirit. I thought it was adventurous and fun. Joanna Campbell is a great writter. Well I loved the book and I hope you will too.
2,NOt Bad,"I am so happy that they have the thoroughbred series here. IT is my favorite series because I love and ride horses and I would love to live on a horse farm ( especially for Thoroughbreds) and do the stuff that the charachters do. HOwever, I have read a lot of the thoroughbred books and did not particularly like this one, maybe because Ashley does not ( or anyone) really ride in this one. They did not ( in my opinion) escribe enough and I would have liked to learn a little more about Wonders Grooming. By Ally"
5,Wow!!,This is such a good book! But you should read the two befreo it(Thoroughbred 1and 2) first because then the book has more contiuity. I suggest this book to everyone who loves horse books.
1,poor,"This bike is poorly made (cheep). if you are over 5 foot you feel like you are going over the handlebars. I would never buy this again, or recomend it to anyone"
3,"Good Bike, poor assembly","The bike is wonderful, price was great. Box was tore open on delivery, small pieces missing. bought pieces at hardware store. finished assembly. tuned, rode."
3,too many useless skits,it has some fine laid back tracks and dope beats but the rest of the cd is filled with lazy slow motion skits which ruined the overall flow of the album....skip this and go for cold krush cuts/back in the base from ninja tune...
2,Boring,"This is a disappointment. I have tried several times, but this CD is not does not at all adress the listener. DJ Vadim can wake up a croud when alive, but this CD will most likely put you to sleep. Save your money and go to a club instead"
4,soldiers of fortune,"this audio is based on diana palmer's first book titled ""soldier of fortune"" and not her combination book titled ""soldierS of fortune"" which includes ""soldier of fortune"", ""the tender stranger"", and ""enamored"" books. so if you order the audio, note that you are only going to listen to the book ""solder of fortune"" . With that in mind, the audio book was good listening. If you like reading diana palmer, you will definitely will like this one."
5,soldiers of fortune,"I recently picked this book up at a used book store and loved all three stories. The Tender Stranger-the story of Dutch and Dani is my favorite, they meet on an airplane to Mexico and were married 2 days later because Dutch wanted her so much anddidn't want to seduce a virgin, I've read this story three times already.My 2nd favorite is Enamored, I loved that Diego and Melissa found each again after 5 years and Diege realized how much heloved Milissa, it was a fast read.The story of JD and Gabby was good too. Strong characters and suspence made this story a fast read also, I reccomend thisbook to all Diana Palmer. If you are not a fan already you will be after reading this book"
2,What a disappointment,"My first and last Diana Palmer novel. The stories are too short to provide any substantial plot development and the characters fall into age-old stereotypes: the women are all virgins and the men are highly-experienced and jaded. I had thought a novel titled SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE would be action-packed in addition to the romance, but there is actually very little excitement to be found. The dialogue is not particularly clever, the locales are not very exciting, and the relationships are tenuous and unbelievable. Next time I want action and romance combined, I'll pick up Nora Roberts or Elizabeth Lowell."
1,More like royal pizs...LOL!,If you are looking for a time-warp back to the forumulistical 1980's this is your Delorean.
2,Not That Wonderful,"After reading the reviews I expected a wonderful book. The author writes in a hyperactive, frantic tone - the kind of person you might want to run away from at a party to avoid being cornered. The book is chock full of other people's ideas and quotes... basically the book is a string of ideas and quotes used to support her own writing, which skitters across the surface and lacks depth. Take away the famous people and time tested ideas of others and there is not much here."
3,I wanted more commentary,"I debated whether or not to give this 3 or 4 stars. Although, I appreciated the lack of opinions, I simultaneously wanted the passages to be placed in some sort of context. Perhaps showing more direct confirmation or contradiction of passages in the approved Bible. On the other hand, this is a valuable tool for biblical scholars. I think my lack of enthusiasm probably is the result of my unrealistic hopes for greater spiritual insights."
3,gospel of thomas,In this book there was too much analysis and justification and not enough focus on the original text. analysis should have been focused on difficult to understand sayings.
1,The Gospel of Thomas : The Hidden Sayings of (a false) Jesus,"There are no ""hidden"" sayings of the real Jesus. His sayings are 100% complete and accurate as they are all recorded in the New Testament. (I.E., in the Authorized King James Version for the English language.)Listen to what the Lord Jesus Christ Himself said:For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad. (Mark 4:22)If you are searching for God's absolute truth and how you can know for sure that you will have eternal life or not, I recommend reading and believing the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans.If you need a trustworthy Bible I only recommend the Authorized (King James) Version Bible, published by Cambridge University Press. They are available through Amazon.com at good discounted prices."
5,Interesting and a little mysterious,"Most the sayings can be found in the new testement, I caught the so called ""hidden sayings"", such as ""break a piece of wood and you will find me"" which caught my eye, refering to God being everywhere, and not just confined to a church, and this seems to be make sense, since Jesus taught the Sermon on The Mount outside and not just in churches or synagauges. The Jewish teachings of the time put a great emphasis on holy places and buildings, but Jesus only used the buildings as a place of gathering and teaching, but... Why would these few hidden saying be left out of Matthew, Mark, Luke & John. I found that difficult to beleive, but I guess thats what makes them mysterious.It's worth reading."
3,3 Stars and a half...,"I didn't bother reading the introduction and commentary, I went straight for the juice and read the ghospel. As a deist I didn't find it so much different from other ghospels, a bit shorter maybe, but about the same. Maybe less jolly and honky dory, a bit more down with life, good and evil are the same and all that. A bit closer to some eastern phylosophy sort of meaning, but still the same, jesus is the choosen one, he shows the way, but then will leave and leave us to dwell with the BS.As footnote, did you know that ""ghospel"" is a wrong word? The original ghospels were written by greeks and they titled them ""Evangels"", which means ""good news"". Speaking of greek, I liked a lot the facing text in greek and coptic. I do suggest this edition of the book to curious ones, at the end of it all is a quick read."
1,"Blah, no relationship with Jesus, just man's 'jurps'.","I am really disappointed with this book and wish I hadn't ordered it. It is nothing more than man's thoughts 'Jesusiphied', to make up my own word, which is just what this book personifies. It is missing all the hope and joy found with forming a relationship with the Creator/Sustainer of the universe. And holds to any other religion there is out there...man reaching up to God in his own way and own terms/Blah!"
2,No Context....less meaning,"I found the book to be an excellent translation, but in general a disappointment. Purhaps I was expecting a true up lifting experience that seems to be promised in the sayings of Jesus. However with out the story and therefore the full picture of what the sayings specificly relate to... the book falls very short on the list of must have information. For the student of history this may be a must. For this interested christain reader it was a disappointment"
2,Fiction Impersonating History,"In his introduction the author admits to creating scenes and dialogues in some places. He should have just called it a novel as this undocumented work doesn't cut it as a biography. Even the subtitle is inaccurate. The phrase ""Public Enemy Number One"" was invented by the Chicago Crime Commission several years after Gerald Chapman was hung (although Chapman did fit the bill). This is fiction, not history."
5,Tremendous wit & style.,"A fabulous read that shirks typical plots and keeps the reader guessing. Publicist Madison Morgan and her crew, snide assistant Meriel, and overly ambitious attorney Jerry Jackson, work to crack the mystery surrounding political candidate Al Miller. They've been hired to put spin control on the fact that Al's brother Willy is incarcerated in Federal prison on drug charges - a cause that Al campaigns virulently against (drug use).Dramatic tension between Willy and Madison builds as the plot thickens. Simultaneously comic and suspenseful, Buzz is a breath of fresh air with a surprise ending that'll keep the reader wanting a sequel soon!"
1,I guess I deserved this,"I saw some Puppet Master clone a while ago. The evil guy kept a femail punk band locked in a cage and had them play whenever he wanted to listen to music. Some of the songs were catchy, so I thought I'd pick up the CD. Big mistake. All the songs basically take one sentence and repeat it over and over and over and over and over and over...it this is annoying you, image what the CD was like. I tossed it."
3,Ken likes to embelish a bit,"Like Planes of the Presidents, this book on focuses on the planes made famous. Such as the 2nd presidential jet that became famous when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. Yes, it has important history but the 1st 707 has an impressive resume that was not even touched. I have also had the priveledge to learn facts from some pilots and other officers aboard Air Force One and they say Mr. Walsh takes some creative liberties to many of his stories and some they said were flat out ""did not happen"". I cannot say who is accurate but logic would say if you want to sell a book, make it ""good""."
3,Long winded author with some interesting information,"I almost quit reading this book in the first chapter. It was like Mr. Walsh was trying to explain to a child over and over that Air Force One is a special plane. I know it is, that is why I bought the book, and I could understand one explanation, but over and over for pages was almost too much.Mr. Walsh brought out some interesting little facts about quirks of President's and their travels. I have read a few books about Air Force One, and like this one, each of them brings something new to the picture. It was however, a bit disappointing in the fact that Mr. Walsh actually flew on AF1, but really never told of his experience, where he flew to, and how one boards the aircraft and exit's it (is it before the President, and do you deplane after he does?).Overall the book was readable. Don't expect any revelations in this book. And skim or skip the first chapter."
1,Not at all accurate,"As a graduate student Of Montessori education at Xavier University, I have had to read MANY books by and about Maria Montessori. Lillard's book is the worst of them. It oversimplifies the Montessori Method and is incorrect in its information. Her books are so inaccurate, we are not to use them as a reference in any paper we write. Many people like to use her books to get an understanding of the Montessori Method because they are so easy to read. However, if you want accurate information, read a book by Maria Montessori. True, her books are difficult to read, but it is worth it for anyone who wants to REALLY learn about her method."
4,A must-have for SLPs!,I really like this book. It's a great step-by-step guide for the assessment and treatment of aphasia. I don't know what I'd do without it.
3,Nice shoe but.....,"I got a pair of these a few months ago from another online shoe jointlooks nice feels nice the only thing that is annoying is the noise they make when you walk squeak,squeak,squeak,and you do notice it, and that started rather quickly after I started wearing them, I'd say after one pickup game of b-ball,and I tried to wear them again but the squeaking is very noticeable so I rarely wear them now, maybe to mow the lawn. I would probably not buy another pair."
5,An exquisitely sensual journey.,"Riz Maslen's neotropical sense of art is beyond limits. The minimal beat and occasional acid lashes, less frequent and furious than Mr. Brubaker's, enveloped by a functioning visceral mood and a very intimate ambient, make this my favourite. You must listen to Neotropic."
2,Zipper won't stay zipped!,"The zipper is sewn at an angle such that it won't stay zipped no matter what. I had to sew it closed. (I promise I have the right size and am definitely not popping out of it or ""busty"".) Also, it is important to note that it ties in a bow behind your neck. I had guessed that, since there was a zipper, it would just slip over your head. On a positive note, my husband thinks it's gorgeous, but I kind of think it accentuates my hips in a big way."
3,"Great but,........","This scuba style suit is perfect for me but, even handwashing the suit still caused the buckle and rings on the belt to rust. Once this happened, I cannot wear the suit anymore. Fitwise it was great but they need to improve the buckle."
5,The Buddies are Back & in Space,Space Buddies is an adorable movie. Of course it is aim towards younger kids but I am an adult and I enjoyed it. It's a great family movie. If you like the air bud/air buddies movies then I think you'll like this one as well.Short Summary: The buddies follow their owners on a school field trip to the space station where they are going to launch a space shuttle on the moon. The buddies are curious to see the space shuttle up close so they decide to go on the shuttle. All of a sudden the shuttle launches and they are launched into space. Now the buddies have to try to get back home while they still can and they get help from their new friend Sputnik. Buy/rent this movie to see if the buddies and their new friend Sputnik can make it home to their owners.Will the buddies be the first puppies to walk on the moon??Don't forget to check out Space Buddies. I don't think you will be dissapointed. Space Buddies is well worth the $13 I paid for it.
5,Awesome,"lots of fun for the whole family, wonderful for kids and uplifting moving about all these cute lil pups. My whole family watches it and ages between 8 to 40 and we all love it even the 22 year old :)"
3,Space Buddies,This movie is cute but like most sequels it lacks the surprise factor. Very entertaining.
1,awful!,"our kids are ages 13 to 4 months. Not that the 4 month old watched it but the rest did ...2 year old, 4 year old,8 year old and especially the 13 year old thought it was awful!! I tried to watch it. couldn't!!"
1,Missed It;s Bark,This was the worst buddies movie. It was a complete waste of my money. As an owner of all the bud and buddies movies it makes me wonder what they were thinking?
1,Thought Police,Movie doesn't seem to work at all on PCs. Evidently the thought police do not think we should watch the movie on anything not a TV.
2,gave my 5 year old nightmares,"the big explosion and the fire almost burning up the Russian man kept my son up till midnight. Good for an older child, though. Nothing really crude, that I can remember, and they didn't speak as fast as in many of the Disney movies. My son hated it and I hated the nightmares he had because of it."
3,The attached DVD is useless,"I've recently bought the latest edition of this book, because I also wanted the attached DVD, which didn't come with the first edition.I was very disappointed to find that the DVD you get with this book is just a cheap infomercial for some other book or DVD set that Fred Jones has produced. It was really useless. You might as well throw the DVD into the trash.Save yourself a few bucks. Buy a used copy of the first edition."
5,My most used teaching book,"I have the older version (2002?) but either way, this is my go to resource for teaching. I use the classroom layout section all the time. If and when I get a student teacher, this book will be my going away present to them. This resources has gotten me through some tough years. I can't recommend it highly enough and suggest you keep it on your bookshelf just in case of emergencies. As a third year teacher I have used this more than any other - don't wait, just order it."
5,Tools for Teaching by Fred Jones,"In my former position as the director of a new educator mentoring program in a large school district, I purchased this book for every new faculty member for years! Those books are dog-eared and well-loved and STILL sitting out on desks across the five campuses I served! In my new position at the university, I often ask my student teachers to invest in this book as I know it will be a valuable resource for their careers! Sheila Wirkus, La Crosse, WI"
3,"Good ideas, but doesn't work across all grade levels","I was blessed enough to go to the training with Fred Jones as well as get this book. I really love the way he comes across his ideas and they are common sense. In fact if I taught older children I probably would have given this 5 stars, but I teach Kindergarten and while the premises are things I already knew it was good to have a refresher on these ideas. The specific implementations that he suggests don't really work well in Kindergarten as there is not much seatwork. I did take his theories on learned helplessness to heart and have tried prompting and moving on rather than ""retaching and tutoring""."
5,I can't wait for the 1st day of school...,"...so I can use the methods I learned from reading this book. I wish every teacher, substitute, or teacher in training had access to this book. I am an old dog and I learned new tricks! Everything is researched, makes sense, and will not cost me more time, but give me more instructional time.I highly recommend this as a must read."
4,For all who deal with educating Children,This is a very informative book. I brought late in the school year and wish I had the summer before. As a teacher it has been helpful and great guide. remember it is not a how to but a tool help sharpen you other tools.
4,Cartoons are great,"The cartoons are great in this handy book on discipline and instruction. There are many useful strategies and it is reader friendly. When I read some of the stories, I burst out laughing. It is informative while being entertaining."
4,must have,"This book is a good book for teachers, althought more applicable for elementary than high school."
5,This book is worth your time!,"Being fresh out of the credential program, I thought I had heard it all. But this book offers new and practical ideas for beginning and experienced teachers. It is worth your time and effort."
5,Even the Experienced Teacher Can Benefit,"This is a must have for any teacher. I have been teaching for over 10 years and benefitted greatly from the information in this book. Every teacher has students that are described in this book. This book gives information on how to handle even the most difficult students. If you are a new teacher, I would also suggestThe First Days Of School: How To Be An Effective TeacherI review both books every August."
2,not as expected,"This did not meet my expectations, though it was a rec from someone with whom I work. Author is from the lecture circuit, which is where the money is in education. Part of a person's income is derived from book sales. Very few original ideas. Some are flat out wrong. Not at all impressive."
5,Great for Middle School Boys!,"This book had some great advice for low-achieving boys in middle school. The seating arrangement suggestions work wonders. Also, the prompt-and-walk away method works for those helpless hand-raisers. I was just about at my wit's end, and this saved my first year from going to you-know-where in a hand basket! My seasoned colleagues really have made me feel great with their positive comments on my classroom-management skills. It really can help you feel good about what you do when things are in your control- Lord knows- we teachers have a hard enough time with the things that are out of our control."
3,Repeat of his other books.,"If you are looking for a book packed with tools for making your teaching better, this is not it. The book contains a few really good techniques with a lot of additional information that is not really helpful. It also contains much of the exact same information that is covered in Positive Classroom Discipline. The techniques are also more appropriate for middle school and lower grades in my opinion."
4,Book saves supply teacher's sanity!,"I started reading through this book and using the simple ""Turn"" and Look technique as my principle tool while substituting in classrooms from grade primary to grade 12! I stay sane now, even in some challenging situations. Loads of practical advice, identifiable characterizations and sanity saving ideas."
3,Kept waiting for the punch line...,"Our district recently got on the Fred Jones band wagon, and while I have to say much of what Dr. Jones says is quite interesting, I was continually waiting for him to offer some specfic examples. He is long on explaining a situation, like how students like to talk in class (this is some big revelation??) but short on specific solutions. Since he is a psychologist he does a fine job of explaining things like how the brain learns, but you don't have to read Fred Jones to find that out. He then proceeds with what I am led to believe are some ""new"" ideas in education like being consistent and remaining calm. Please! I suppose this may be useful for someone very green and with little or no experince, but as an experienced educator I found it tedious, generalized, and very quip happy (ie. Calm is strength). I continue to be amazed at plethora of books for teachers that re-invent the wheel and make big money for others, with book tours, videos and the like."
5,I'm Only Human,"This is one of those exceptional books, universal in scope, that already existed as a Platonic ideal but no one had yet written. Everyone has served up to himself or herself at least one of the rationalizations listed here (""What are the odds of a handicapped person needing this spot while I drop off my video?""). Always a good idea to have a reference volume like this handy--you never know when you'll need more. Very funny and sharp. And the drawings by Roz Chast are a perfect counterpoint to the prose. A perfect gift for every man, woman, and child on the planet. If I tried to improve this review it would just sound less spontaneous and sincere."
4,Great gadget.,The ringer is loud enough for my mother to hear the phone when it rings!!! A great help for her.
4,good ringer,bought this for my elderly mother and she has no problem hearing the ringer when a phone call comes in.
3,Ringer,"The product itself works well, even with an answering machine. However, we expected it to be louder. Even on its loudest setting, it's not as loud as we assumed it would be~"
2,Loud but not deafening,"This unit is like a slightly louder extra Ringer, but it is far from being loud enough. This would not wake my father, whom requires Hearing Aids to hear, if he didn't have his Hearing Aids in and the Ringer was on the Bed Stand on the opposite side of the bed. It is nice the volume, tone, and ring pattern can be changed."
4,Works as Expected / Will Buy More,"I purchased several of these to use in a call center environment. These ringers are loud enough that everyone hears them but are not so loud that they scare or alarm anyone. We actually keep all of them set to the lowest possible volume. They do sound electronic; not like a bell but more like a ""warbling"" sound. However, this works out well for us. The units allow you to adjust the pitch of the ringer and this allows us to audibly know which line is ringing without having to look at the units. Of course, the glowing red light at the top of the unit helps with this as well (yes, our lights are red, unlike the photo in the item). And, finally, I like that they come with a AC power adapter AND can take normal AA batteries in the event of a power failure. Overall, these ringers work as expected. We will be purchasing more as we grow."
2,very very bad HC :((,"High Contrast, what happened to you and your innovative and creative attitute to the DNB? Your music sounds all the same on this album and this album is very very boring. I am sorry to say that since you were one of my DNB favourites...."
3,Gets the job done.,"I guess this is what happens when you buy the cheapest one: The rough-hewn little window-block includes only 4 screws in the package when it really requires 6 to install (if you use the stop-plate.) I think that theoretically the piece of metal that blocks the window from being raised far enough to admit a thief is designed to enable the owner to slide it to the inside of the window and raise the window all the way (for instance, if you are at home, and want to ventilate some cooking gone wrong.) Sadly, this is not going to happen. There is no way that piece of metal will slide around to the inside - not without some kind of tool - a pliers perhaps? So that's the bad bit. On the positive side, I definitely feel like having these on the windows adds another layer of security. Along with the German Shepherds and the alarm system, I feel almost safe in my ramshackle ghetto shack."
3,"Nice, but does slip","I've got a large chest for my size... petite frame (5'5"" about 140 lbs) but a size 34 / 36 DD. Since this was strapless, I went a size smaller like they say. I've used it a few times, and it'll stay in place for about an hour or so, but definitely not much longer.Luckily, you can utilize straps, so I still use it that way, but I had specifically bought this to be strapless and am a little bummed I can't rely on it in the way I'd like.However, it is comfortable as a ""regular"" bra, so it's not a total loss! :)Oh, and be aware... if you want to use this for a dress that has a low neckline, be wary. The middle of the bra comes up VERY high, and can be seen even with shallow Vs."
2,I have nothing good to say,"This bra was unattractive in the picture, but i thought if it held me up and was comfortable, it would be worth it. What a shame. It is horribly uncomfortable (the underwire comes up unnecessarily high in the front middle, poking into my rib) and it makes me freakishly misshapen (the top pinches down so much that it flattens me and causes my skin next to my armpits to bulge over the top.) What a huge waste of money."
1,Bad bra and NO RETURNS,"I took a chance on this bra even though the description doesn't say what kind of lining/padding it has (at least not as of the date I ordered it or the date of this review). It has the thinnest lining. I poked straight through it (and this is supposed to be a bra for fuller figures? who wouldn't poke through this thing?). The company said they won't give me my money back, they only do exchanges. No thanks."
5,Busty? This sis what you're looking for,"I'm a 34 G. Not only is it difficult to find a store that even carries that size, but one with a strapless bra of that size? Forget it. I am so very happy about this bra. I can wear it strapless without worrying that I won't have support. It's comfy. It's amazing."
2,Not for large chested women,"Because I am well-endowed, I have never been able to wear one. I have been big up top since I was 11. I do have a long-line corset by goddess which I used for my wedding but it is uncomfortable and now since I have lost a little weight it is way too big. I have it on now and am just trying to get used to it. Hopefully it won't take that long. I have a few outfits, I want to try it with. I will wear it for the remainder of the day to see how it goes.I used the measurements and it said for me to order a 40DDD. I probably should may have gotten a 38 because it giggles when I walk a little at the top maybe that's the key.UPDATE: still no better. This was a waste of money. I guess I can use it around the house."
1,"ok, but not good for cleavage","This strapless is a nice bra but I needed it for a bridesmaid dress and it flattened me out. It also is cut straight across the top so if you are wearing a shirt or dress with cleavage, you can see the bra."
5,Finally!,I've never been able to wear halter dresses or anything strapless because I'm a 34DD. Finally I can. The silicone strips and thick band really help to lift the girls and keep them put. I would recommend this product to any woman frustrated by having to wear thick sleeves to hide her bra!
5,This is the bra for you!!!,"This bra is amazing! I have had such a difficult time finding a strapless for my DD's. This bra does the trick & never slips. Highly, highly recommend."
1,DISAPPOINTED,IT SUCKS! IT IS ALREADY HARD ENOUGH TO FIND A BRA THAT FITS AND THIS ONE WAS DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT.. THE PLASTIC ON THE INSIDE STARTED FALLING OFF WITHIN THE FIRST FEW TIMES OF WEARING IT.. WHICH MADE ME ITCH..
1,I have never been more disappointed,"I read all the reviews and thought that I had a good product. I ordered my size 34DD and it's doesn't even come close to supporting or, in fact, covering my breasts, much less staying in place. And it is so expensive to be that far off the mark."
2,Uncomfortable,"I gave this review two stars only because the material and workmanship of this product is really beautiful. Unfortunately, wearing this is very, very uncomfortable. Would not buy again."
3,poor quality,I purchased this bra recently and i am a little dissatisfied with the quality. The small elastic bands to the side have broken after only wearing it two times. Its fits great but not sturdy enough.
4,Best Strapless Support!!,"Yay! A strapless bra that can support a very ""healthy"" chest size. I am a 38 DD. i hovered over the order button for many minutes trying to decide if u should gamble on ordering this bra. I am glad I did. It does not fall down. You still have to do the periodic adjustment here & there, but for the most part, it stays in place. Well done! So glad I ordered this bra."
5,Can't get enough!,This has been one of my favorite offerings from HBO. Steve Buscemi is outstanding in this complicated role. He is both vulnerable at times and ruthless as they come. I also enjoy the fact that this series has gone to great legnths to make all the details accurate from the period. Great show!
2,Poor quality,This is the second time I've bought a video on amazon. Both times the quality has been terrible and very fuzzy.
3,Disappointed,"Loved the 1st season, and most of this season too. Unfortunately the last 3 or 4 episodes wreck it. The plot makes no sense and doesnt knowwhere its going. I had assumed they had great storywriters who had planned the whole thing in advance, but alas it seems like they're makingit up as they go, episode by episode. One minute Nucky's in Power, next minute the young Darmody is the Big Boss, yet inexplicably continuesto run around like a hooligan shooting people, cutting throats etc. As the Boss surely he would have his goons do this for him? Finally Nuckyescapes jail and a murder conviction by the skin of his teeth only to immediately commit another murder, this time personally, of the youngDarmody. Just makes no sense at all."
4,Season 2,Find the series interesting and SPOILER ALERT (was very glad to see the actor who was killed at the end - GO) Otherwise I may have had to abandon watching this series.
2,there were not code for the digital copy,"The digital copy code space in the redeem paper was in blank, I can not download my digital copycan you help me up??"
3,My review,This is a reasonable series but lacks the hard hitting story lines of series one which I thought was outstanding.
5,Boardwalk Empire: The Complete Second season,"It was a ""must see"" after seeing the first season! I must admit that it would be for mature audiences only, as there are many instances that would be considered X-Rated. It is a well written thriller that kept us on the edge of our seats. Steve Buscemi is great in the roll of ""Nuckie""' and I can't wait to see the next season!"
3,Good series,Bought this for my father. He loves it and marathon watched all of the episodes in one day.I couldn't really get into it though it could just be because I only caught bits and pieces.
5,Board walk Empire Season 2,Just as good as the first season. Can't wait for next season. These DVDs are and excellent buy. Would recommend. For my son who's on the road. Will purchase again. Thanks Amazon.
4,Great stuff,"The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it was too dark even when we made basic adjustments to our TV. The setting, story, and acting were all excellent. Avoid it if nudity and graphic sex offend you."
1,Now with collectible coaster set,"Season one of Boardwalk Empire was released as a fabulous Blu-ray box-set. Now season two is being bundled with the same episodes duplicated on DVD and no option to buy the Blu-rays by themselves. That would be very handy if one was buying a Blu-ray box-set for some unknown reason despite lacking a Blu-ray player. I look forward to season three's Blu-ray/DVD/VHS box-set. This is a recommendable series, but a disappointment of a home video release."
3,It was okay.,"Well, the second season had less episodes then the first season ,It had the same action that gangster movies have. I do like steve Buscemi acting and I look forward to watching season three ."
5,cool,"My favorite series! Available to watch at my own pace, which was all day marathon! Hope the series continues. Great actors, great storyline!"
3,some endings are just plain stupid,"I was lovin it until the end, can't believe that happened to jimmy i thought he kept things interesting, just don't see season 3 getting any better besides more people getting killed. HBO is really going to have to show me something good on season 3 before i continue to watch. Jimmy to me was the main character i was thinking he was going to learn from his mistakes and inherit it all. I was proved wrong"
5,Boardwalk Empire Season 2,Great show at a even better price. Great perk is that the bluray even came with a DVD copy... now I'm waiting on season 2 of Game of Thrones so I can order it from Amazon as well.
1,This is the worst of the series so far,This is the worst of the series and I had to pay for it on top on that. Not Good
5,Wonderful,I'am waiting for third season (I hope).Las actuaciones son excelentes particularmente la del protagonista. Las locaciones y la ambientación es maravillosa. Espero que hagan una tercera parte.
5,Great show,Nucky is my hero. Steve Buscemi is perfect for this role. One of my must watch series along with Dexter and Homeland. Amazon has a good delivery system.
5,NECESARIA,"Si la primera temporada fue excepcional, esta no lo es menos.Sonido buenísimo.Calidad audiovisual excelente.Recomendada totalmente.Como siempre, gracias Amazon.A más ver, H."
5,Gangster with Class,"First I would like to say keep up the good work HBO, BoardWalk Empire is unlike anything I have seen on cable televison relating to organized crime since the Sopranoes. This show takes you back in time when alcohol was illegal to cosume any where in the 50 States in America. Nucky Thompson played by Steve Buscemi made that possible to all the patrons that entered Atlantic City at that time back in the roaring nineteen twenties error. If you are a organized crime film buff like I am, this sitcom is one of the best underrated shows ever produced in the history of televison in my book. So get your glass filled with whatever your name of drink is and, set back and enjoy the ride back in time in class of the underworld and prohibition at it's finest."
5,Marvelous series,"Really have enjoyed this series and the previous year as well. This is well produced, with great character development. If you like American History with a special interest in the 20's, this is worth a look. Just very entertaining to me...mob oriented prohibition era."
4,Love it.,"Cast is tremendously talented, writing is spot-on, the sets and costumes are perfect, music is great. It's obvious that this show is run by a creative team at the top of their game. One caveat - Paz de le Huerta is the most nauseatingly affected hipster d-bag to stumble out of NYC in ages. SO glad to see her off the show."
4,Fun Read,"Very enjoyable book. My 84-year-old mother enjoyed it, too. We can't wait for the next one."
5,Quick fun read,"Being a Florida native and growing up surrounded by snow birds and transplants I love these books. Being older now, I appreciate the interaction between the characters. I'm waiting for another book please."
1,Horrible writing style,"Awful book. I tried so hard to like this book, but his writing style is just awful. Does he not know what a full stop or period is? I'm so disappointed."
2,I have just one question?,"This book was put together by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks?Just w-h-o is the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks? Are you a government office, foundation or organization?Where do the proceeds go? To the government?"
4,A Book for the People,Lots of people criticize this report. I do not condone simply reading it and believing verbatim what is said. However I would still encourage you to buy this and read it. It is a part of history and who we know are. It's about why things have changed. Reading it made me think of how going to the airport and our lives as American's might be different if the events on 9/11 hadn't happened. Now that the price is coming down there is no real excuse for not getting this. I personally feel that the commission did a good job of putting this all together. I find the illustrations and tables along with the notes are a valuable asset to providing some credibility to this book. I would recommend this book as one groups view on a very historical event.
1,The most disgusting cover-up of our lifetime,Lost a family member in the twin towers & could have also lost my sister if she showed up to work that day. The report has no on-the-ground witnesses that were actually there helping people. The bomb blasts witnesses & victims before the first plane hit were not mentioned. It all starts to unravel from there. Buy The 9/11 Toronto Report by James R Gourley instead for a reality based account of what really happened.
1,One Star is too much!,This book is flawed from the very beginning. They didn't investigate the causes of 9/11 but accepted the Bush administration's theory and never used a critical approach. They never investigated why building 7 was demolished with demolition charges. They never questioned why towers 1 and 2 collapsed when there has never been a steel framed building collapse from a fire...ever. They never questioned the lack of Boeing 757 parts at the Pentagon. The list of ommissions goes on and on. This is a seriously flawed book that should never have been printed.
3,they should have kept kissinger,"As a historical document, this is and will be a must-read. It is a a testament to the subordination of the people's request for answers to a political culture both charged with and responsible for such a commission."
2,Wonderful Kangaroo Commission Book,"Wow a true work of art to bamboozle America into scapegoat 911 on Osama Bin Laden. The book consists of nothing more than theorizing problems and solutions based on the assumption that 911 was caused by Al'Queda. The book clearly does not investigate anything but hypotheticals of terrorism which will ultimately be caused by the United States.The book is a ruse whose sole purpose is to:1. Place blame on scapegoat.2. Make it look like the government is doing something about the problem.3. Now there is an official book to wave at people to convince them that they are stupid because the evidence they talk about isn't in the official report. This evidence then becomes seen as ludicrous conspiracy theory thought, and must be disregarded entirely lest it might make a thought criminal out of you."
1,Ask Questions Demand Answers!,Written like a novel and if it were not such a crime I would actually recommend it. Unfortunaly it has no resemblance to the truth. Save your bucks to buy a well produced film that pulls together documented factual historical information along with video evidence from the crime scene. You will see the bombs going off and will be shocked that you had ever missed them before. Check it out and share it with everyone. Damn it America Your not that stupid and you claim to have pride Lets see it! Get angry Ask Questions Demand Answers! loose change 2nd edition online at loosechange911
1,Biggest whitewash in the history of this country.,"Please do your own research. This is full of holes, unanswered questions, no depth and an alarmingly high amount of discrepancies. I will not add more to this review as you can see many have already hit bulls eye with what's wrong with this report."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"Unfortunately, I am not sure how else to describe the report other than... well... garbage. I hate to say it but there are too many holes and it does not hold up to scrutiny.Although it had a good story to tell and made popular by the government and media, it is just that- a story that does not hold up to the facts. I was hoping that it would provide more insight into the events on 9/11 but it left me asking all kinds of questions especially about WTC7, evidence of thermite, omitted testimony of eyewitnesses, and the testimony discrepancies between Cheney and Mieta.I am deeply disappointed that I wasted my money on this. I gave it 2 stars because it did a least grab my attention and provided some good references in the back."
3,Still covering for the little man,"Was informative, but it still covered for the president who ignored specific warnings during the spring and summer of 2001 to cut wood on his Texas ranch..."
4,descriptive but...,"This book is obviously well researched and is a must read despite of any political status or opinnion. Buyers should be forewarned that a large portion of the book falls under references and notes, but the book itelf cannot be put down.The reason why it got 4 stars was because of bad recomandations. An intelligence zcar that combines all of the agencies will only promote Bureaucracy and inefficiency. Also, if anyone were to acces the information from this central agency, it would jeopordize all of them.that is my opinion"
1,please do your own research,"If you are serious about reading this book, I would strongly reccommend reading David Ray Griffins book at the same time. It shows this report to be a completely politically motivated whitewash. If you havent got the patience for this, then just google ""loose change"" and watch the video (second edition is better). This is a first step towards the truth."
2,"Long on politics, short on usefulness","Like any blue-ribbon public inquiry done in the wake of a major disaster, the point of this comission was not to seek answers, but rather to (1) use the forum for public vendettas and (2) convince the public that Congress was Doing Something. The public hearings were used to find scapegoats, and the book itself, being a product of two parties with equal say and a strong desire not to have their actual errors in print, is a selective collection of mea culpas, hand wringing, and a promise that everything will be better if we just make these few massive structutural changes.One only has to look as far back as the Challenger disaster panel to see how little actual good comes out of these projects. There were similar inquiries after Pearl Harbor, Watergate, the Tet offensive... the list goes on and on. And as in these past instances, the full story will only be told by historians once the principle actors are all dead."
3,Very illuminating!,"This is an excellent report. In particular, I found the part that FMR Pres. Bill Clinton had four shots to take out Osama bin Laden but didn't because of ""preemptive paralysis"" very illuminating! All Clintonoids, liberals and democrats need to read this book for the Clinton part if for nothing else."
1,what a bold face lie!,"I would like to read s book that is non fiction, this book doesn't answer hundreds of questions that my 3 yeard old son would have probably asked. Americans really need to wake up."
1,Not worth the paper it is printed on,"See David Ray Griffin. Mr. Griffin proves this report was a work of fiction.Watch Loose Change. Go to Google video and type in 9/11. Look at the REAL evidence.Men in caves did not defeat a trillion dollar U.S. military and waltz through the most heavily defended airspace in the world.Look at the website from Scholars For 9/11 Truth. Do some research.The only ""conspiracy theory"" is the one contained between the pages of the 9/11 Commission."
1,This is what happens when the fox gards the henhouse,The American public was not satisfied with the Warren report about the Kennedy assasination. This so called report makes that fiasco look like children's play. I belive the ruling elite have just decided that the American public is under such good control that they can just get away with anything. Read this if you want to be dissinformed or if you are intelligent enough to extrapolate the thruth by studying the aliby. God help us.
1,Tragic,"This book is a disgraceful cover up. Full of lies that the American people will swallow whole, no questions asked...do some real research before you blindly believe anything in this book of falsehoods..."
1,This is a joke,"According to Wikipedia:The commission was criticized for significant alleged conflicts of interest on the part of commissioners and staff. Further, the commission's report has been the subject of much criticism by both the commissioners themselves and by others.The commission members were appointed by George W. Bush as well as Congress, which led to the criticism that it was not a commission truly independent from the U.S. government whose actions it was supposed to review. The commission stated in its report that ""[their] aim has not been to assign individual blame,"" a judgment which some critics believed would obscure the facts of the matter in a nod to consensus politics.In addition, commissioners believed that key agencies of the U.S. government, including The Pentagon, the FAA and NORAD were deliberately deceiving them, and that the CIA was deliberately impeding the work of the commission. On the whole, the chairmen of the commission believed the commission was set up to fail."
5,Should be a required reading for every American,"This fascinating moment-by-moment account of that horrible day gives you chills each page that you read, but we need to KNOW, and to REMEMBER what has happened to our friends and loved ones. Written in clean plain language, yet detailed enough to relate every piece of information so painstakingly gathered by the commission. It seems voyeuristic, but we must NEVER forget, and should all know the complexities that we could not overcome, but should be prepared to one day face again. It's not partisan, nor blaming, but is a chilling representation of what we knew and didn't know, what we didn't know we knew, and what we should have known..... Not written to agree or disagree with, but to inform, and is truly an amazing read."
4,Very Good With More Readings,its a very good publication at last made public. We have to be aware of media influence on our livess. I suggest reading The Bewildered Herd as well for anyone interested in such effects on our opinions especially in times of conflicts and wars.
2,"Read this, but along with ""The Third Terrorist""","This book is an in-depth resource regarding the terrorist threat posed on America. As such, it deserves to be read. However, I gave this book only two stars because it disregards evidence of middle-eastern complicity regarding one of the pre-9-11 terrorist attacks on American soil. Read this, but to understand the whole picture, read ""The Third Terrorist"" by Jayna Davis."
4,Sounds like he has made up his mind,"Just reading over comments, ran accross the John H. Morrison comment. Made me laugh to myself because he didn't even read it, but he has obviously made up his mind. Why comment and say it's so bad if you haven't even read it? Sounds to me like someone just wanted a soap box to stand on.The book wasn't as good as it could of been, but it's better than what it could have been. As always, it's worth a read, if anything just because it was a historical even that happened in your lifetime. After reading it, though, I do wish that more had been done, but what are you going to do?"
1,Bogus Commission,"I read the Report when it came out first. It was the biggest piece of hogwash. The Commission did not cross examine Condoleeza Rice and others enough. Instead they agreed with whatever the interviewees said. This is a joke and an insult to the lives lost on September 11, 2001."
1,Unlikely,"The commission operated under the ""leadership"" of Philip Zelikow, a Bush administration insider (he wrote a book with Condie). That's the first problem. The Commission never deals with the collapse of WTC Building 7 - yes, another building went down on 9/11, at 5:30 PM. Interviews were never conducted with employees who heard explosiong prior to the planes hitting the buildings. The security company for the WTC was Bush's brother. For the truth of the 9/11 disaster, read David Ray Griffin's book - this one is total fiction ."
1,It is all lies,"What most people who read this report do not realize is the degree to which the truth escapes any mention. Aside from the fact that the Executive Director of the Commission (not its chair but the guy who oversaw all the real work) is an associate of Condaleeza Rice, now her leagal counsel at State, the book omits a significant amount of important information. Two deserve immediate mention, 1) six of the supposed hyjackers are in fact still alive and most have been interviewed by major media in Europe. This report does not even acknowledge this point. 2) Building 7 collapsed for no apparent reason. Never before in history have steel framed buildings collapsed, and so all three are suspicious. But building 7 was not even hit by a plane, it just had a few small fires and then came down, as if by a controlled demolition. The lease holder even claimed this was what happened in a TV interview and then changed his story.This report is simply a cover up."
1,A useless report full of omissions and lies,"The report was censored & omits anything the government does not want you to know. Even the co-chair of the commission admits that it's full of lies.If you want to read this fictional account of what happened on 9/11, why buy the book? You can download the entire report for free."
1,Good Fiction Novel,"Too much omitted evidence:No plane at pentagon? No Wreckage?Steel Buildings - A Fire never forced a steel building to collapseBuilding 7 - unexplained collapseTotally Incomplete, a disgrace of literature.It is our duty as citizens to seek the truth."
2,Not what I expected or needed.,"This is not a study guide, it has author information, chapter summaries, character information, themes, style elements, historical context, and critical over views. It does not include the study question, discussion questions, etc that I would expect from something titled ""A Study Guide."" That is what I get for purchasing the least expensive one."
5,We just cracked up reading this story!,"As I like books by Astrid Lingren, I bought this one and we loved it! It's a very funny story - proof it to yourself!"
5,Depth of Character,"I just recently started reading the Moe Prager series (in order) and am delighted with the depth and emotion that Mr. Coleman conveys in his writing. I also like the fact that the cases that he writes about are plausible.I will warn you that there is some character development that takes place in this book that I think will be necessary for the subsequent books (which might make the story seem to lag a bit at times if viewed as a stand-alone book). I would also recommend reading 'Walking the Perfect Square' first to understand the groundwork for some of the family dynamics.Overall, I found the book to be enjoyable and interesting and would highly recommend it."
5,An excellent tool,As all of the other oral exam guides have done - this book prepared me for the checkride and I passed w/flying colors.
2,Leaks,"When I connected the compression tester to the extension, it leaked at the male/female connection even with a new ""O"" ring and screwed in as tight as I could get it. Checked compression without the extension and it was 20 PSI higher than with the extension. Finally I expoxyed the male end of the tester to the female end of the extension. Now it works fine. I have three testers, so I sacrificed one to be permanently attached to the extension."
5,One of my most useful engineering texts,"We used the White text as our introductory to Fluids course, and as an engineering student, I feel this is one of the most resourceful and informative texts I own. The material is broad and inclusive at the same time, with excellent example problems and relevant summary problems.It also is suited for some work in more advanced fluid courses, as it includes topics such as cavitation and shockwaves. I reference it all the time. Really made the coursework easier."
4,Number One Fluid Book,This book has got almost all the basic principles of fluid mechanics that an Engineer require. The way the author presented the theories is excellent. I have found it very useful for my PhD work.
2,Not a good book for first course in fluid mechanics,"I was a part time instructor over the summer at a certain university in Midwest and found this book extremely difficult to teach from. Though the equations are correct and elegant but author makes huge leaps from the mathematical vector equations in theory to simplified equations in an inconsistent manner. This makes instructors' life hard as he has to fill in missing steps for many solved problems in the book. After reviewing all the undergrad textbooks on fluid mechanics, I would recommend people to use Introduction to Fluid Mechanics by Fox and McDonald. This book can be easily read and followed by the student while leaving instructor(like myself) for more time to elaborate on theory in detail."
1,Fluid Mechanics,"I am a mechanical engineering student. We used this book in the first couse of fluid mechanics. Many of my classmates and I find this book difficult to read and follow. The author has the reader constantly jumping around the book with 'internal references'. In other words, while reading chapter 3 the author references chapter 6,7,4,2,1. The reader is constantly turning pages. Our unsatisfaction with the book has taken us to the library to find old texts on this subject so we can learn the material covered in this book."
1,This book is hard to read.,"I think this book is quite difficult to read. Many equations in the book, I don't understand because I don't know where is it from. It's make me very very confuse. I suggest to buy another book if u want to understand how the equtions come from."
5,AMON TOBIN: Hard Sequencer Swing,"Rarely does an album come along that breaks new boundries and pushes the envelope. The first time I heard this album I was for lack of a better word I was speachless. Truely beatiful textures and tones are only complimented by the hard breaks and inovative drum work. In reading some interviews I learned that all this album was made with Qbase on an old mac and a sampler. The planing and time this must of took blows my mind. So many time in the recently developed and some what pretensious DJ scene, one must listen to album after album to find any thing original and fresh. I was quite inspired to hear Amon Tobins album. Bricolage is evedince that music will still continue to evolve and progress as an artform. The technology and talent equation sometime is often subtracted by hype and divided by ego. I am glad to see that a few individuals are still able to equate technology+talent to = music."
3,Precursor,"On its own terms, a fine enough, creative but dated d&b disc introducing everyone to Tobin's particular jazzy fusions, but for almost all who have heard his sequential work, a shallow appetizer."
3,"Entertaining, but lacking a style","This CD starts with a track (Stoney Street)that is completely off track from the rest. Overall, the best track is the second (Easy Muffin) and afterwards it somewhat flows, but never really finds on overall style between jazz overtones and dark dub-step. Still enjoyable to listen to, but only randomly in a large playlist. It seems a little rushed to production."
5,Godly,"that's all I have to say, this is my favourite CD ever, after Endtroducing. Best mix of Jazz and D 'n' B."
3,Good..but you have to get used to it.,"supermodified was one of the best albums i ever baught and when i found this one at the local record store i picked it up instantly and popped it into the cd player in my car on the ride home. The first song really impressed me. Tobin seemed to have given up his typical drill style. ""Stoney Street"" is a excillent well peoduced acid jazz track. ""Easy Muffin"" is a masterpiece. but then the CD took an unuasal turn and the songs became so intense and fast that I was a little trown aback. Many artists today make good drill and base music (Squarepusher, Clifford Gilberto et all) and i love them for it. But here I feel Tobin got slightly more carried away then he needed to. Hadrcore tobin fans will thrive on this one but first timers should be slightly aware this is not is best work..most optimisticly i can state its avrage."
1,very poor customer service,"Panda might do a good job of catching viruses but their customer service sucks. You get a limited time of support . . . free for 3 minutes and then 20 bucks after that. They they cut you off and it is all pay over the phone. They don't have a toll free number so they are charging you while you wait in que- at times very long waits exist. Dealing with their support on line is even worse. Not very logical web site for tech support and before you get anywhere you must first fill out lots of forms and then hope for a reply.They boast of daily updates but many days you don't need this, so why tie up your resources?! I'm asking for my money back!So if you have any installation problems like I did, expect a large investment of your time and possibly your money."
1,badly configured software,I installed the panda antivirus software 2005. My broadband connection goes through the firewall. Panda always messes up messaging through firewall based routers. I can't get to internet after that. I uninstalled and now even I can't get through internet. I personally don't recommend anyone to use panda software and get tangled into problems and top of that you have to pay tech support to ressolve any issues. I will probably go with pc-cillin anti virus.
1,Pass on Panda,"Panda 2005 may have a good detection track record, but it will slow your startup and shutdown to a crawl. On three freshly formatted and installed Windows XP systems (that is, aside from the windows update patches, Panda is the only program installed), the bootup time after Panda was installed increased by anywhere between 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Also, every once in a while the protection would become disabled, requiring yet another reboot.Please, save your money and get something like NOD32 or even Norton."
1,"Slow, upgrades faled","I lived with Panda 2005 randomly pinning my CPU usage at 100% for several minutes at a time mostly because it was impossible to obtain a response from tech support.In a last ditch effort to keep things running I upgraded to 2006, on-line upgrades stopped after two days and as I could not obtain tech support, I just gave up on the product.My own fault, I guess, for throwing good money after bad - perhaps you can avoid doing the same."
1,Completely AWFUL!!,"This product is HORRID! I loaded it, and my internet connection was shut off by it, and none of the 'trditional' way of getting it started worked. I called Panda, Microsoft (who couldnt help, as it was 3rd party software that caused my problems), Panda again, and nothing from anyone. Horrible customer service, Horrible product.Buyer Beware!!You are hereby warned!DO NOT BUY THIS AWFUL PROGRAM!!!Norton is the way to go...FOR SURE!!!"
5,good product,I am very happy with this product. It is running on an XP Home operating system and all is well. It is important to completely remove any existing antivirus product before installing this one. When I sent e-mail to tech support they responded within 24 hours.
1,Poor Customer Service,The software hangs up when trying to scan a file. Repeated attempts to get help from tech support resulted only in a string of emails that asked me the same questions over and over.
5,Slow but effective,"It is true that it slows down the boot time of your XP machine, I completely agree but having used Norton and McAfee, Panda runs like a dream compared to the other two. It doesn't interfere or cause problems they way that the Big Two do.If you can live with longer boot times, you will really enjoy the protection that you get from Panda Titanium. I highly recommened it!! It is a worthy alternative."
1,Panda Titanium AntiVirus 2005,"I switched from Norton to Panda on the advice of a radio computer show. (yes, I formatted to completely get rid of Norton) Panda seemed to always be updating, which made me feel secure, but it tended to bog down my system at the worst times. My PC wound up getting a bad virus, which blocked my internet access and anti-spybot software. The extremely rude consultant told me that I had an ""old copy"" and needed to download the new version. Gee, I installed the version that came in the box 6 months prior, so how could it be an ""old version""? And how was I supposed to download the update if my internet access was broken? The problem was never fixed, so I let my license lapse and will get NOD32 instead. Check out blogs and you will see that others have the same problems as I did. Probably the worst part of this experience was being made to feel like I was an idiot when asking for tech support right after my initial submitted e-mail."
1,Don't waste money,"I bought this to use with nascar 2002 and it is bad. You can not control the car. I finished every race in last. I use the regular controller and could win. It is not sensative enough. By it turns your in the wall. DON""T BUY"
4,"Great test prep, but you will need lots more information","Obtaining an FAA Private Pilot's License requires:a) passing a medical exam; b) getting a passing score on a written, multiple-choice test; c) answering an examiner's oral test questions; d) successfully passing a flying test after practicing flying with an instructor and solo for typically 50 hours or so. This book can readily get you the memorization required to pass the written test. It's an excellent tool for that purpose.Beyond that, Jeppesen ""Private Pilot"" provides the in-depth information that you will need. Finally, the FAR/AIM book of Federal Aviation Regulations and Aeronautical Instruction Manual will round out your basic Private-pilot preparation library."
3,nostalgic look at the past,This was a book I read for my book club. I liked the story yet I felt it became repetitive. I think I would like to see more pictures and a few less stories. I found myself wishing the book would end and kept going back to the photos.
5,Great Writer,"Typical of Greene's style of writing, this book is captivating in the first few pages. He has a way of making you feel as though you are right there.The story of a small Nebraska town's impact on so many military people is a great joy to read.Great book!"
2,Once Upon a Town,"An interesting and heart-warming story, but the writing was too ""schmultzy"" for me, i.e., candy coated and simplistic."
2,Could have been much better!,"Interesting subject and a story that needed to be told, but it's rather repetitious (everybody seems to have the same recollections of the famous North Platte Canteen), and lacks photos, which would have helped (the cover photo is the only one, and it doesn't even show the canteen). It would have been nice to see what Greene was writing about, especially since the station no longer exists--a fact we are constantly reminded of throughout the book. It's a quick read, and a decent book to pass the time with, but could have used an editor to tighten up the prose and clean up some typos. I was disappointed."
5,Once upon a Town,"This book should be required reading for all children and adults (younger than 40) so that they will know the sacrifices made by ordinary people on the home front during World War II. The dedication and generosity of these Nebraskans is astounding and puts just about every modern charity to shame. These people who had so little during the rationing of food, goods and gasoline gave more than any organization can come close to doing these days, particularly those with their millions upon millions of tax-deductible contributions. This is an account of real-life American ideals realized, the stuff of which America is made.Thank you Bob Greene for an easy-reading, enthralling account of a monumental committment to the troops who came by North Platte Nebraska during WWII. I could not put the book down!"
4,easy read,"He is a good and easy story teller and it opened my mind to my WWII father and asked him if he had traveled through that town, but his train didn't go that way."
2,"Great story, amply researched, ordinarily told.","Having recently spent time in the sandhills north of North Platte, I was excited to learn what this town was like not long ago. It's a beautiful American story, but the historical accounts and interviews became redundant about half way through, and Greene was perhaps too kind to what the town is today -- an all too perfect example of the downward spiral that is the American, and especially the middle American, small town."
4,Great ompany great juicer,I bought the Samson 6 in one to juice wheatgrass and other veggies and am very pleased with this juicer. It does a fine job on wheatgrass especially. I run the wheatgrass pulp through again to get those extra few drops out. The customer service personnel at kitchen best are super polite and helpful as well as knowledgeable about their products. They deliver service that is lacking with most company's these day's. How can you go wrong with a 90 days satisfaction guarantee!!
1,False advertising!,"The title says ""6-in-1 Juicer"", but after I got it I realized that it only does a couple of things and the rest costs extra as you need to buy a bunch of extra attachments. . . and they are not cheap at all.I asked the seller to change the description because it was misleading and clearly false advertising, he assured me that he will, but of course he never did.Good thing they offer a one year replacement for the parts, because only after 6 - 7 times of use, one part cracked already. They did replace it, but I had to pay for the shipping. I am not very happy!"
2,Juices well but doesn't last,"I did so much research before purchasing this juicer 2+ yrs. ago. The quality of the actual juice this produces is excellent & it does extract just about every drop of juice possible. However, as time wore on the locking collar began slipping more & more and I had to keep tightening it frequently all through each juicing to where it now barely holds...so I'm done with it. Also, I felt I had to cram greens down the chute too much before it would grab & I'm tired of that as well, so I am opting not to pursue the hassle of a warranty replacement. After researching new juicers, I am now going with the Hurom; however, if you prefer this style of juicer, I'd recommend you look into Omega as that one appears to be more highly recommnended overall by juicing people in the know than this Samson one."
5,bringing back the memories,"I grew up in Pearl City in the 70's- 90's. Attended some of the Summer Jams at the Waikiki Shell. Sister went to school with Shawn Nauau. Sorry if I spelled his last name wrong. I am dissappointed that they did a remix on ""96 degrees in the shade"". Lots of memories! Aloha!"
4,Fun book,Great book to have for anyone who enjoys an adventure. Lots of walking options within the city
4,Good for tourists and natives alike,"Stairway Walks in San FranciscoI have lived in San Francisco all my life and this book has introduced me to all kinds of nooks and crannies that I've never seen before. Instructions are generally good and maps are excellent. There are a few typos, so you have to keep your wits about you."
5,STAIRWAY WALKS IN SAN FRANCISCO,"I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT TO MY SON WHO LIVES IN SAN FRANCISCO AND KNOWS A LOT OF HISTORY AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE CITY. IT HAS ADDED SOME INFORMATION AND HE HAS ENJOYED THE BOOK . HE IS A CAB DRIVER AND MEETS A LOT OF VISITORS. WHEN CUSTOMERS ASK ABOUT THINGS HE RECOMMENDED SOME OF THE WALKS AND HAS WALKED SEVERAL HIMSELF. "" STAIRWAY WALKS IN SAN FRANCISCO "" GOOD BOOK GOOD GIFT."
4,So far so good,"Was inspired to buy this book as a tourist who ALWAYS walks the stairway to Macondray Lane having seen ""Tales of the City."" Just did the first walk yesterday and can't wait for the next. AMAZING that there are actually homes alongside the stairways.To piggyback onto a previous reviewer's comment about choosing each walk carefully, also make sure you watch where you're putting your feet. In the course of reading the commentary, looking for the plaques, or admiring the environs, I twisted my ankle and bruised my knee after losing my balance on a rut or rock on the sidewalk. Rather clumsy of me I suppose, but it could happen to others.P.S. Also not for someone with a fear of heights. Walk 1 features a descent down the Filbert stairway, the last part of which is steep and potentially nervewracking. I kept thinking, ""If the 'big one' hit now..."" <Grin>"
2,Limited Charging power & Lifespan,The battery cannot be replaced and has limited lifespan < 2years.After 1 month of use. It wouldnt flash anymore. Had to switch it off for two full days and sun-baked it before it would work again.Overpriced.
2,Worked for 4 months and then....,nothing. I really liked this item but 4 months later it not longer works. Definitely way overpriced and not long lasting and I live in a place that gets a large amount of sun daily. I am definitely disappointed.
3,"Academic yes, informative, a little","Since I have heard so many great things about Richard Rohr, I was a bit disappointed with this text, which read more like a psychology text. Because the enneagram isn't a definitive tool (they're aren't many/any in psychology), it is a great deal of speculation. That is fine when based on more experience. I would have appreciated more stories about how the authors of the articles included herein have used and found useful the enneagram vs. more theories about it. Don't give up on Rohr's other stuff though."
2,Best look not in white,"This Hilton model has a light brown sole that makes it to look chepear than it is, and although in photo it looks not bad, directly seen white with that color does not look good. Guess that sole will look better with the Hilton Gold, Brown an that type of colors."
3,"Great shoes, but just not for me.","I bought these for potential wedding shoes. They're very sexy, but they look like they would go along with a stripper pole. LOL Great value, cute shoes ... But, not what I would normally wear. Not to mention, very very uncomfortable!!"
1,Stay Away,"Worked good for about 4 months, then it started to display white vertical lines. lamp hours were low around 80. Cant find anybody to fix it and sending to infocus is too costly. Now stuck with a 600.00 piece of plastic junk. TV repair man told me that Infocus does not sell replacement parts and that there are no aftermarket parts available, so only choice is to send it back to them at a cost of 475.00, NO THANKS ILL TAKE MY LOSSES, but will never buy Infocus again."
4,Does this hook up to laptop?,Does anyone know if this projector is just for a TV or if also hooks up to laptop? Does it require a special cable or cord?????
5,Owned for years with no issues,"I love this projector since I bought it years ago(probably around 2004); I looked around a long time to find the best value for my money and settled on this projector which has not let me down. I have not used it regularly, loaned it to friends a couple times for events or while I was traveling. I also bought the aftermarket ceiling mount which I think is a good idea since the included stand is plastic. Lightweight and does what I ask. Some people might watch TV all day long and get some issues with overheating or burnt out parts but I never have. I estimate the total hours on this bulb (original) to be about 500. Played video games off of Xbox and my laptop, movies from DVD player/5.1 home theater and laptop. All that and it's one of the more attractive projectors I've seen as well!"
2,Not designed for long term use.,"I received this as a gift from my wife for Christmas 2006 and although I didn't have a home theater to run this with, we pulled it out at parties and projected a movie or video games on the wall. Works fine... looks nice. Now, 16 months later and with the unit only accruing about 50 hours of use, I built a full home theater and the unit suddenly died before I could even use it once.This is apparently a common problem with these units... they just suddenly stop working. Many people fix them by replacing the internal fuse... I read about someone fixing theirs by rolling back the firmware version inside. Unfortunately, neither of those works for me, and sending it back for a $400+ repair is my only option.I'll never buy another Infocus item again... after 50 hours of careful use, no power surge, no abuse, it shouldn't have died. The 50 hours were nice though, which is why I gave it 2 and not 1 star."
2,"Mediocre performance, cranky manufacturer, unfair customer service","I've had my projector for a few months and was pretty happy with it until I needed to move it. After that it started to display a bunch of white vertical lines. Customer support suggested to send the unit for inspection and they found that I damaged the unit by using too long screws. But I only used those that were supplied along with projector, so I assume they simply did not want to repair it (it was still under warranty). Stay away!"
4,Pleasant Surprise,"Hello,I purchased this projector after reading about it and seeing the rebates they offered for it.Setup is a snap.The Input options are great for a project this low costed. HDMI, S-Video, Component, and DVI(?)I do wish it had internal speakers for Game playing as I wanted to use it in other rooms.DVD look WOW from this projector.If you are looking to get into home theater, this is a very good option."
2,"Good picture quality, but bad product build quality","I have had this projector for over 3 years now. It has experienced all the common problems that people report in the forums. It broke down within a couple of months, and was fixed with no cost to me as it was still under warranty. Then a couple of months later it was the underpowered fuse, but since it was not under warranty anymore, I replaced it myself. Now the third and the worst failure happened just a couple of days ago when I turned it on and saw smoke coming out of the projector. I opened it up and the power supply capacitor C517 and the fuse were burnt. I replaced them, but something else is wrong since the fuse keeps blowing up every time I turn it on. I have had no luck in getting hold of a replacement for the power supply board.PROS:- Very good pictureCONS:- Repeated component failure"
5,You got that right!,"As an avid Skynyrd fan, I found this book compelling reading. The detail on the band's formative years was outstanding. I was also fascinated to read about Ronnie Van Zant's evolution from schoolyard rebel to rock star. He was certainly a character.I read an interview with the late Billy Powell somewhere recently where he expressed a degree of relief after Ronnie's untimely end due to the fact that the bashings he used to receive at the hands of Ronnie were over. I was a little surprised that the band allowed themselves to descend so deeply into alcohol and drugs; however it seems that this was par for the course in the 70's.One thing that surprised me was there is no reference to the author on any of the album sleeves. Plenty of gratitude to the likes of Craig Reed and Dean Kilpatrick, but no mention of Gene Odom. I would imagine the author may have embellished some aspects of the book; however it is a must read for any Skynyrd fan."
3,About Lynyrd Skynyrd,It wasnt good the only thing i liked about it was the front cover. I really enjoy all kinds of music books but this one just wasnt my type. I wouldnt reccomend it but if you are willing to read a boring book go right ahead.
4,Story of the American Dream,"This book is excellent. It tells the story of Lynyrd Skynyrd as only a friend could. The fact that Gene Odom loved the guys in the band is apparent from the first pages. He provides an honest and insighful portrait of young musicians who loved their art and worked their rear ends off to make it in the music business. Odom doesn't whitewash the facts - he presents all characters as they were, warts and all. If you are a fan of Skynyrd, you'll consider this book a walk down memory lane with a few old friends - you'll hear some familiar stories about the band and maybe a few you've not heard before. Even if you are not a fan, you'll find this book to be a heartfelt story of a bunch of poor boys from Jacksonville who believed in the American Dream - that if you believe in yourself and are willing to work hard enough you will acheive your goals. A good read!"
4,Good ... but could've been great.,"The narrative is there, but the author too often only teases at the details that are the core of any book about the rich and famous.There's quite a bit of discussion about the very strong personalities in Skynyrd, but again, detail is lacking.Lastly, the writing is at times overwrought, like a fifth grader just learning to write. I hold no grudge with the writer other than to say this story deserved a more competent writer's touch and direction.As for the band, we all know that over thirty years after their plane crashed into that Mississippi swamp, their catalog is still required listening for any student of rock and roll."
4,Dead Skunk,I bought this CD for my husband and he loves it. This was a difficult recording to find and was a nice surprise when my husband opened it. Not to many people would have any desire for this particular CD.
5,Clarity phone,Bought this phone for my mom who was having trouble hearing her old phone ring. This phone has great ring tone and hearing volume as well. Nice big numbers and the photo spots had a nice touch. Great phone
4,Clarity Phone,"I bought this phone for my mom. She loves it. It's easy to use and very loud. Finally my mom can hear us. The only issue she had with the phone is that she has to manually increase the volume each time. A better feature would have been that the volume would have stayed as adjusted previously. She tends to forget what button to push to increase the volume at a later date.Over all, she loves the phone.Thanks,Sean"
4,Quite usefull,Mom has poor eyesight as well as being hard of hearing. Would have been nice if the amplifier for the receiver could be set to stay on so that button would not have to be pushed each call. A small picture is not of much value for the vision impared. A set of the alphabet with letters large enough for each space might be a nice touch. Mom has to feel for the correct button and remember which is who. Still she really likes the one touch feature.
3,A unique product with just ok quality,"I purchased this as an xmas gift for my grandmother, who has Alzheimers. While the concept is good, the execution is a little off. The phone feels very cheap, and I imagine it won't hold up to too many falls off the nightstand. The worst problem, however, is its lack of battery for memory -- it loses its programming every time it's unplugged!A smart company would produce a similar product with a higher standard of quality and make out like a bandit."
4,"Works just fine, as described","I was a little skeptical about purchasing this product based on other reviews that cited technical snafus, but since my need for big buttons as well as big speed dial buttons outweighed the potential problems, I bought it and it has worked for my mother exactly as described."
4,Be aware of physical difficulties.,"This phone seems to be perfect for older folks. It works well and is well designed, but my 92 year old father still had trouble pushing the buttons - just physical frailty. Who would of thought that pushing buttons was a difficult task?"
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I bought this phone for my father who has the first stages of Alzheimer's. Upon receiving, I could not get the phone to work. Called Clarity support and first thing they ask me is if I have analog or a digital phone lines coming into the house. I had no idea. They told me to call the phone company and if it turned out to be digital, the phone would not work. After going through a long drawn out process with the phone company, I was told my area was still on the analog system.I got back in touch with Clarity told them I was indeed analog. I then had to go through a few checking points with them. They then decided the phone muct be defective and since it was now over 30 days, I would have to mail it out to their service center. It cost me $20.00 dollars to send in for repair. It has now been three weeks and I still have not received my phone.What a hassle! There has to be something better out there! Save your money and do better research than I did."
1,30 days then DOA,I got this and set it up for my friends grandmother. It worked great and she loved it for about 30 days then it just quit working. It will receive incoming calls but the button do not work so it will not dial out.
4,Amplified Photo Phone,Simple to use pre-programmed buttons you can attach small head-shot photos on but I preferred to attach actual first names as easier for my mother's impaired vision. The handset is not ergonomically comfortable on the ear unless you rotate the handset away from your mouth. The extra amplification button was a nice feature.
2,"Works for a while, then volume dies off.","We loved this phone at first because it simplified the dialing process and we can tell our elderly mother to ""Push the blue button"" to raise the volume. After a while, though, the phone started losing volume and getting very quiet some time into the call. Customer service was helpful, sending another one free of charge. After a couple of months, the new one is starting to do the same thing. I'm giving up and going to find a different product and manufacturer."
5,Ameriphone P300 Phone with 18-dB Amplification and Photo Speed Dial,The buttons are very large and easy to find . The fact that you can put a photo over the button for easy recognition is great. You just pick up the receiver and push one button and you are connected to the number. My mother is 95 years old and can now independently call those closest to her with no difficulty.
2,OK for some users,The photo speed-buttons are a great idea. But the buttons should accommodate larger photos for visually impaired users. Also the amplification on this model is too weak for someone with moderate hearing loss; the P400 model would be more suitable for those users. Some manufacturer is going to figure all this out some day. Maybe they will get real smart and combine it with speaker-phone (feedback challenges) and answering machine features -- even cordless for facilities that are not conveniently wired. GizmosForLife was great about returning the unit.
2,Sounds like a god idea but...,The phone seems cheaply made and flimsey. The sound (why I bought it) is not good and it did not have much amplification.
4,Very Practical,Easy to set up and very practical for use by a bedridden elderly person. Using photo images of relatives and care takers a single touch will dial the appropriate programmed number.
3,Okay Phone for grandma,"Good phone for sight or hearing impaired person. Large buttons, volume boost, memory dial with abiity to put in pictures of designated called party instead of number. This said, phone works byu quality not that of the old AT&T phones or the newer Japanese phnes made by Panasonic etc.. However, these other and better phone manufacturers do not make a phone with buttons as large as that on the Clarity phone."
2,Wasted money,"I regret getting this phone for my mom. She has dementia and is confused enough as it is to have to deal with this thing not working. Many times since we first got the phone, the voice fades away. At first I thought it was my mom pulling it away from her ear, but since it has happened to me I know that it is the equipment. I cannot hear her and she cannot hear me. If you are going to make phones to help people, at least make sure they work and do not cause additional unnecessary stress on people that have enough to deal with."
1,cheap,"This phone was purchased for someone in a nursing home. The materials are cheap and would not hold up for someone with vision and dexterity problem.It was almost impossible to set up. The booklet fails to mention that you need batteries and even when you figure it out, there was no way to know if you need four or two batteries! The batteries slip in the case and the lid did not hold them firmly. As a result, you cannot program the phone.Since I was past the month to return, I am stuck with a costly phone that does not work. DO NOt buy this for the elderly."
4,Great Product,"The phone arrived very quickly and was very easy to program. We purchased it because my husband has dementia and can no longer dial a phone. With this phone he just pushes the photo of the person he is calling and he is connected, so it's working very well for him."
1,Worked for 12 weeks,Bought October 3rd and it stopped working last week and I tossed it in the trash. Hand set quit working and it would not retain stored phone numbers. You get what you pay for and this is a waste of money!
1,Wouldn't hold memory; got NO response from company when I contacted them about the defective product. My mom can't use now.,"Nice phone, but, when I programmed numbers into the phone, the memory would not hold them. Thus, the phone is totally useless because it was purchased solely for this feature. I registered the product online and wrote the company as the phone should've been covered under warranty. Thus far, no response from the ocmpany. A total waste of money as my mom can't call me by pushing one button as was the goal with the purchase. Very, very disappointing experience and purchase."
1,Coned by Deception,"Take a look at the photo. See any orange dots around the top of the black base like the cheaper offers? Didn't think so. The cone you see is NOT what you get, but has hollow (not solid) lugs on the base bottom - a cheap cone by all means. Shipping too expensive to return. Delivered 10+ days late. Pathetic!"
3,"I Like Maysa, But.....","....Shanachie Records isn't helping matters! I just recieved Maysa's new 'Feel The Fire' CD, and it only took a few plays for me to write this review. Before Maysa landed on Shanachie Records to record the previous 'Sweet Soul Music' CD in 2006, she released a string of GREAT CDs on the Rice & N-Coded Labels ('All My Life', 'Out Of The Blue', and 'Smooth Sailing'). While Maysa's vocals are stellar on 'Feel The Fire', the music & production cannot touch the quality exhibited on her pre 2006 CDs.IMO, Maysa was doing fine at her previous recording home (also as the featured vocalist for Incognito!), and to relegate her to this 2nd rate record label should be a crime! Please, don't get me wrong, I have all of Maysa's CDs (as well as those by Incognito), but these 10 track Shanachie CDs are worth NO MORE THAN $9.99...SERIOUSLY. Maysa, PLEASE return to a record label that will help you release CDs up to your high standards.You deserve much better!!!Peace, SD(of 'Chakasworld')"
5,Great remake CD,"Maysa displays her smooth groove essence with her second ""remake"" CD, ""Feel The Fire"". She covers alot of R&B/Quiet Storm goodies with her own style."
2,disappointing solo effort,"i absolutely love Maysa but the production quality, lyrics and her beautiful interpretation and her sheer vocal stylings are left on her Incognito cds, She seems to be straining on this cd , she doesnt sound comfortable at all. The Shanachie label has the cheapest and disposable sound, it's as if the recording was done in someone's basement, I encourage solo artists to go independent, but you cant lend your vocals to bad productions. Shanachie has disppointed me with the latest releases of Deniece Williams, Vesta, and Miki Howard, we are talking powerhouse singers, it such a shame that these woman including Maysa have settled for such a poor alternative. My suggestion, Maysa: Get the Incognito producers to support you completely on your next solo cd, they care about your voice and sound, and will spend time with live instruments and not radio shack sound systems and cheap shortcuts. you definitely deserve better."
3,Not as good as her prior effort,"Doing CDs full of covers of classics isn't for everyone. Maysa did very well with ""Sweet Classic Soul"", but this one doesn't measure up to that effort.There are some early highlights, as the first three covers are excellent. Her cover of ""Happy Feeling"" is the best on the CD, although the Norman Connors classic ""You Are My Starship"" isn't too far behind. (As covers of the latter go, though, Wayman Tisdale's is still the best I've heard.) Additionally, Chris Davis, who plays most of the instruments and is making his mark as a producer, really shines on here.But on the whole, this CD, while a good one, just doesn't do it for me like her prior effort did."
4,On Fire!!,"As a long time fan of Maysa, I am always surprised at the sheer beauty of her voice. She knows how to take any song and make it her own. I especially liked the songs she chose to cover. However, I think its time for her to grace us with some of her original material."
3,"Works good, but does not last long","I like this heater, its the most accurate I've had in the past 20 years or so, but it only works for about 12 to 18 months before it needs to be replaced. And you need to make sure you you clean off the algae every few months to keep it accurate. After a while it stops heating so good, and you have to turn up the temperature and then later it just stops working all together. I've had two and will probably buy a third in the next couple of weeks. It is nice in that it fits into the filtering unit, so less stuff hanging out in your tank."
3,Used to be better,"I used to buy this product years ago and found it online so thought I would get some. For some reason, the smell of the oil is very faint and not as potent as it used to be, not sure if its been watered down?? Live and learn...."
1,wish I could give it zero stars,"Dessay has a terrible screech for a voice. She may do well acting in comedies, but her Lucia was so foul and polluted I wanted to take a bath. You want to hear a real voice? Try Angela Gheorghiu."
2,Another French Album?!,Does Natalie Dessay even know how to sing Italian? Whatever. I find her boring and flat. Her middle range drives me batty 'cas it's non exsistent and too sharp for my taste. I have no clue how anyone can compare her to Lily Pons becuase Pons notes were flawless and effortless. I always hold my breath to see if Dessay hits her notes well or if it just comes out piercing and sharp. She's about 50/50. She is no Lily Pons. She's decent but utterly forgettable and frankly I'm not sure why people are so enraptured by her. I find Sumi Jo much more appealing and talented
2,"Lots of questions, little review, some accuracy","This book offers a lot of practice exams, which is nice. However there is only about 20 pages of review or discussion. The answer keys do not explain answers, they simply repeat them. As the other review states, accuracy is questionable. There are many questions in the practice exams where the answers given in the key are clearly incorrect. After the first exam I found myself questionning whether I was really missing questions that I was unsure of or whether the book just gave the wrong answer again."
2,The only review you'll need to read,"If you are looking for the best Anne Frank video don't buy this one. The story unfolds very slowly. It's mainly focused on their hiding in the attic but the way it progresses the story is verrry slow and drawn out. It's on bluray and the video is great the audio recording is good but doesn't take potential of it because they are only in the attic mainly just dailogue but doesn't justify my rating I rate on the actual ""movie/video"". If you are looking for an Anne Frank movie look no further... buy thisAnne Frank - The Whole Storyit's a dvd there isn't a bluray out right now at the time of this review but it's way better. the story progresses more quickly and shows time in the attic and in the actual camps. great video if showing in the classroom look at the dvd rating though. I originally watched it i believe on abc or nbc when it debuted."
2,The Diary of Anne Frank,I bought this movie to show to my students after we learn about the Holocaust. I thankfully watched it before showing it and was very disappointed only a few minutes into the movie where there is a scene of Peter getting out of bath water and it shows his whole naked back end. I cannot show this in school!
5,Life during a very difficult time,Very educational and informative. Highly recommend for a learning experience. All ages can learn from this truly sad story. A must read.
5,Masterpiece Theatre: The Diary of Anne Frank,Movie received as advertised. Wishing a few parts were not in the movie as I needed to show it to 8th graders and had to black out and fast forward a couple of parts. Not the sellers fault.
3,B Movie but with a Nice Twist,"This was a TV movie, and frankly, it stole a few things from big screen movies -- like the theme music from Patton. The acting ran the gamut from really good to really baaad. Nonetheless, it's entertaining as a look at how a commander takes over a failing division and rebuilds it in the middle of combat.The most interesting thing is that this commander recognized the probability of a spy within, and called in the Army Counterintelligence Corps. Only two movies I'm aware of even recognized the existence of, much less the contributions of the CIC. That alone makes the movie worth viewing. Add to this L.Q. Jones' portrayal of the CIC major, always an actor worth watching, and you have a pretty ok B movie.No, it's not an award winner, but it's just different enough to be fun. Give it a try."
5,Great sample pack and excellent value,"I feel like this was a great deal. With Prime and free shipping I could never have gotten it delivered for less. There is a lot of aluminum bar here, more than you imagine when you order it. Ship this in a sturdy box next time Amazon!"
3,stated color misleading.,"I purchased this console from amazon.com. It is a nice console and it is the only one I could find that would fit in between the charcoal bucket seats that I put into my 68 chevy truck. I can't tell whether the top or the bottom is supposed to be charcoal, but, to me the top is black and the bottom is gray. So, be advised the color may not be what the standard for charcoal is."
1,"Fun, but worth it?","I love the look of this and so does my newborn daugher. I think that the price is a bit ridiculous because it IS a wind-up that doesn't last very long at all. I would really think it worth the asking price if it took batteries so that it could last longer or had a remote to keep turning it back on. Additionally, we have not used it very frequently (a dozen times or so?) and for some reason it has just stopped rotating. We had previously had the Symphony in Motion by Tiny Love. I think that is a much better mobile."
1,Not a good Mobile,This mobile looks good but that's about all. The song didn't play for very long and the mobile doesn't turn. It wasn't entertaing for my little one at all!
1,Just an expensive regular shampoo,"I'll admit that I have only been using this shampoo for about 1 month. All the reviews that I read online about this product from various websites were negative but a new dematologist that I met with suggested that i try it since finasteride alone wasn't working. So far, this shampoo has done nothing for me but give me really flat, almost sticky hair. It's supposed to be conditioning shampoo but they definitely left the conditioner out! I am still losing the same amount of hairs everyday and still have the same amount of scalp itch. It has a medicine smell which doesn't really bother me but many people have been complaining about it. My suggestion, save your money!"
3,Better than I expected after reading the reviews,"Lots of explosions, a dodgy plot, plenty of electronic gadgets which required a certain amount of blind faith to believe in and a bit of sex (lovely!!!) albeit at an inappropriate moment and interrupted before consumation by the KGB (I hate them). The acting was passable except for that of the KGB which was pretty pathetic but all in all, it wasn't as bad as it was painted. I shall watch it again one day now I have bought it."
2,such a bad film,This is one of the worst movies of all time. The plot is so cheesy and the acting and action is so stupid. The romance is not good because there is no chemestry.
4,Decent action movie with super Cindy,"The story is illogical. Cindy is a busy lawyer and Baldwin is the cop and some ex KGB agents with absurd reasons are hunting her down. But who really cares about the plot once the chase begin. Cindy Crawford's good look is enough to sit through this silly but rather enjoyable action movie. Another bonus is you can see a glimpse of Cindy changing her T shirt and a brief love scene. The downside, the DVD is in full screen and no other special features. I also bought a region 3 version and it is in wide screen and also in Dolby 5.1 and it is playable in region 1 players so if you insist of having to see this movie in WS you can get the region 3 version instead."
5,An excellent action movie!,"This movie is not as bad as the other reviewers mentioned. You have to give Cindy Crawford a hand considering this was her movie debut and William Baldwin played an excellent cop as well. If you are looking for a good action movie to entertain on a weekend, you won't go wrong with this one. The plot is good, there are plenty of action and what a pleasure to see Cindy on the big screen! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
3,"Uh, did I mention the music score?","Yes, it's true that the story line was weak and the acting was NOT top notch. But, that wasn't what caught my attention. It was the opening and closing music theme. It still haunts me and is stuck in my mind. After I saw this movie the first time, I found myself humming the theme repeatedly for a week. And now, whenever I hear it while watching DirecTV, I stop whatever I'm doing to listen to the haunting melody - and I AM NOT easily impressed!"
3,Why be so negative?,"Why are all those reviews so bad?Hell yeah, Cindy Crawford can't act, Baldwin looks like straight out of a baby oil commercial and Slma Hayek's appereance is something to be ashamed of. But let's face the facts: Who cares? The action is spectacular and you can defenitly enjoy the visual style of the director and since the producer was Joel ""the Matrix"" Silver, this piece of film has quite a lot of energy in it. Mark Mancina's beautiful music not to mention... Just turn off your brain and enjoy the images!Sometimes this is what movies are about..."
1,UNFFAIR GAME ...,"THis an unfair game to Baldwin, who didn't deserve this failure, and a fair game to Crawford and the producers, who taught a history with no script and badly directed could hold itself only in the laurels of a beautiful and famous model... The audience is not so stupid as they think..."
2,Dont give up that day job just yet..!,"Nice try Cindy but it just didnt click.Maybe you should have taken those acting lessons after all...and to you Mr William Baldwin, pray tell us what did you get out of all this?"
5,If you like movies like Die Hard you will like this movie,I love this movie. A tough cop who helps protect a woman whom is on a hit list. If you like movies like die hard you will like this movie. This movie should not be watched by children because of the sexual content (obviously it has sexual situations since a super model (cindy crawford) is in this movie) so I recommend not letting kids under 17 watch this movie.
3,cindy crawford,cindy and william baldwin are good together but the dialog is terrible. the action scenes are so over the top but still i found the movie entertaing.
1,"BAD,BAD,BAD.","[...]RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN FROM THIS SORRY WASTE OF DISC SPACE.GODAWFUL ACTING,THE PLOT STINK'S.AND CINDY CRAWFORD ISNOT THE REASON TO BUY MUCH LESS WATCH THIS AND GOD WILL NOT FORGIVE ME FOR WASTING MY TIME IN DOING SO."
1,amazing,"Well, there was a nude scene, if we look at the good points. Oh, heck! It was impressively poor, so it can't be a dissappointment. I mean, what could you expect!"
1,Yet another reason Amazon needs to offer negative stars.,"Among the low-lights of this sorry action movie scripted by a dead-monkey's feces, Cindy Crawford outruns and jumps on to a speeding train. Meanwhile, Billy Baldwin is going about 80 on a car and can't catch up to the train! Cindy has some legs to be able to run about 100 miles per hour. Come on, we've come far enough that movies should not have unintentional mistakes in them. This one will remind you of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" only not quite as cerebral. Add the business-as-usual action, the unbelievable (as in bad) acting, especially from the supermodel, and the fact that it is just plain BORING. Cindy'll never work for Hollywood again. (hopefully)"
1,Fair Game? Hardly!,"Cindy Crawford has long been one of my favorite models. However, that talent is unrelated to acting and sheer star power won't carry the day.Cindy's portrayal of a KGB-chased, short-skirted lawyer was, well...not good. On several levels. The character was written paper thin and Cindy's ability to make herself believable was nonexistent. I'm sure she tried hard, as did Mr. Baldwin, who seemed more like an acting coach trying to save scenes than a costar. The plot was by the numbers, the pyrotechnics only so-so and the stunt sequences were beyond any credibility.Unfortunately for us and her, Cindy's performance was the worst in my memory. But now I'm told a new low was reached by Denise Richards in ""The World is Not Enough"". But that's another story."
3,Fair Game DVD,The movie itself is what I expected. What I didn't expect was that the movie is only available in full screen. There is no widescreen for this movie. I did not know this going into the purchase.
2,Fair Game-The Movie,"Dear Amazon,This product is the first product by Amazon that dissappoints. First of all the print quality doesn't matches DVD quality, secondly sound rendering is also poor. Lastly it doesn't offers even subtitles. I would certainly like to replace this item with the same title but which fulfills all the required parameters.Raj"
1,Arguably one of the worst action films of the past decade.,"Yes, Fair Game is that bad. With a cast headed by William Baldwin and Cindy Crawford, the acting will be at best atrocious, and when things are bad, it can get unwatchable. The action scenes are of decent choreography, but it doesn't generate any excitement. Considering the hoary material involved, that's basically sticking a fork into this movie."
2,"Decent movie, Horrible DVD","This movie isn't really that bad. Sure the plot is cheesy and the accents are horrible, but that's it. There is a couple of cool action sequences and some funny lines. The acting by Baldwin is alright, nothing spectacular; Cindy Crawford really surprised me though, for a supermodel her acting was real good, not oscar caliber but she was believable.Now the DVD.Horrible, first of all it is full frame; no widescreen at all. No trailers or extras, and the picture quality sucks. You should buy the vhs version and wait until they release a decent dvd for this.Fair Game the movie: 7/10Fair Game the DVD: 1/10"
5,Wonderful CD!,"the Joffrey Ballet does a wonderful piece called ""Light Rain"", which uses several tracks from this CD, which is how I found it in the first place. It's on my fave playlist, and I just bought one for my friend, who is a belly dance enthusiast.If you like New Age, Alternative, or Middle Eastern music, I'd definitely recommend it!"
5,Try this book!,"This is a very good book for parents to help their children to learn how to read. It's a very good book for teachers to read also. I reccomend that every parent and teacher read this book. The book teaches you some easy steps on how to teach your child to read , the steps are pretty basic so I think that any one could follow them."
4,HELP ! My Child Can't Read,"The ""no - nonsence"" approach of Ms.Jackson's book HELP! My Child Can't Read is quite remarkable.No big research, no impressive statistics; simply mother to mother kind of guidance should hold a torch for many distressed parents."
4,EASY READING,"As the mother of an infant,I found this to be a very interesting book. Even though the author wrote it because her child temporarily had learning problems, I thought the suggestions in the book were both helpful and easy to do. Once my child is old enough,I will certainly apply them. I think that these ideas will work whether your child has problems learning, or if you just want to try something fun and new. I just felt the book was a little too short!"
3,"decent for thin hair, but the conditioning version is better","I like this shampoo, but it's not the best for my thinning hair. This revitalizing shampoo is great when I really haven't washed my hair and it's little dirtier/a bit greasier. Otherwise, it's a bit too intense for daily use leaving my hair a bit poofy and synthetic feeling. I definitely recommend the Tricomin Conditioning Shampoo instead. I also alternate their conditioning shampoo with Nioxin to keep my hair and scalp stimulated and I've found both products work well together."
4,A little goes a long way,"A decent product, i think it might help some more than others, but a little bit goes a long way and over all its a decent shampoo."
3,I tested this product on my toddler grandson. ...,"I tested this product on my toddler grandson. The scissors were difficult to use on him because the blades were too big to cut his nails. I tried to use the scissors on my own nails, but I felt a nail clipper would've provided a cleaner cut."
1,Poor quality and barely cuts the hair.,"I would not recommend this. It is hard to get it to cut. Not very sharp. It was cheap, and I got what I paid for."
2,Merengue songs,"I was not expecting so many repetitions of the same song... the song is good, but all the CD has is the same song in different re-mixes... 8 or 9 tracks of the same things is just not right even when the song is good."
4,Epson R320 Bluetooth Adapter,"I recently purchased a Epson R320 Bluetooth Adapter after trying to get my printer to work with generic BT adapters. When this one arrived, it was virtually PNP. The printer worked as is should using BT. Two small issues, some print jobs take a LONG time to complete, and using BT, your ink levels and some maintenance tabs are not available. Those are the reasons for four stars. Other than that, I am happy with the purchase."
1,"Over-promised, under-delivered","This device says it will make wireless Bluetooth printing on the Epson Photos RX700 an ease...it's even recommended in the manual. But, unfortunately, it worked only after reloading Gutenberg drivers (mentioned nowhere...because there was no manual and the printer manual said to see the USB device manual). It also doesn't work with the Apple iPad until you use a third-party piece of hackware to get it to talk to each other. Buyer beware."
1,Cannot get it to work....,"I added this adaptor to my PM 225 Charm order, excited about printing via Bluetooth. I have Windows Vista. Ultimately, Windows points at Epson (contact your manufacturer for the latest software -- did that, and there is no fix) and Epson points at Windows as the reason it does not work. If this is an Epson product, Epson should be sure it works (EASILY!) before marketing it as a wireless choice for printing. Would love any hints any other purchasers have who actually got it to work. :)"
3,Works well for what it is supposed to do,"I too experienced much slower printing speed compared to direct USB connection. But it is not the adaptor's fault. The speed of Bluetooth itseld is much slower than USB. So I have given up connecting wirelessly from the PC and use it only for what I bought it in the first place which is to print pictures directly from my PictBridge enabled cell phone. I have the R380 printer BTW. There is a list of compatible printers on Epson's website and it is also listed as in stock at the Epson store. Finally, the item in the picture looks like a generic Bluetooth dongle; mine is dark gray, straight, and with white stickers on both sides. I bought mine from the Epson store."
2,Mizuno Glove,"The glove works great. Looking at the image, it is a nice black baseball glove. However the other side of the glove is pink! Nowhere did I see any indication that the glove was a girl's softball glove. Looking at the little picture in the center of the glove more closely you might figure out that the softball thrower is a girl, but not from the image on the site (where it is clearly identified as a ""baseball glove"". My son was not really amused - although I was able to use a red marker to make the pink look red."
5,This book is an actual testimony,"I'm very impressed reading his work and how he gives in full detail about the spanish inquisition. Although this book covers the not so flattering side of the spanish conquest in Peru, we finally get a glimpse on how a mestizo (his parents were incan and spanish royals) got the best of both worlds with all sincerity. It's really uncensored on the real life events at the time... really a must read. There should be a movie about this!"
3,this robe is polyester filled!,"I've been wanting a double lined silk robe for quite some time. I finally decided on this one. I received the robe today. I have to say I am surprised it is lined with 100% POLYESTER1 How is a 100% silk robe filled with polyester!? I re-read the listing again today, I still don't see it mentioned that it's filled, let alone with polyester. I guess the words...our warmest robe, should have been my clue?"
4,Fun read,"This book was a fun read and I enjoyed the period setting. If you'd like to read my full review of the book and even read an interview with the author, just go to my mystery review site at:...Lorie Ham, author of MURDER IN FOUR PART HARMONY(also available here on Amazon.com) & THE TROUBLE WITH TENORS, and mystery reviewer for Suite101.com"
3,"good idea, fair writing","Jim is an extraordinary man, however his writing is at best fair.The book is not believable the way it is presented. The underlying idea of peace and love, on the other hand, spoken through the mouth of children is touching and eye opening. It is a good reminder of where our focus should be. For this reason, I would recommend it. Jim's ideas are pure and if payed attention to, will advance growth of the soul."
5,great,"it is great you can play any system of the fowling playstation,Xbox,gamecube,playstation2,and even dreamcast!"
3,It works,"For the first few weeks, but my puppy is quickly growing and this product will need to be replaced with a bigger size. However, I like the design and how it sits in a stand. I think the stand can be a little more stable, but overall it serves it's purpose."
4,Good product but wish it was nicer looking,"I bought the 5 quart raised feeder for my great dane. The feeder is very stable and at a good height for her. The bowls are fine but made of fairly thin metal. I have two similarly sized bowls from Petco that are much stronger and thicker and fortunately fit perfectly in this feeder. I do like that it is light enough that it can be moved around easily and is not as obvious as other feeders. I do wish it had a bit more style (such as the Orvis feeders), but for the price, one gets a pretty good feeder that does not break the bank."
4,raised dog bowls,"I thought the legs would also be stainless steel; however the package info states not to let the legs remain wet, as they will rust."
5,Great Product!,The Ethical Pet Double Diner Stainless Steel set up is great for our three Great Danes. The construction of the stand is great and should withstand several years of Great Dane abuse. The taller stands are hard to find in my area and are essential for a happy Great Dane and a healthy Great Dane. I will buy this set again!
1,Worst Roulette Product ever,"I am not making this up, this is by far Worst Roulette Product everIt has styrofoam balls that stick to the side of the wheel, the balls dont spin aroundI have owned small roulette wheels before , that only cost S1 they were just as small buy the littleballs were made of lead This product is a Rip Off idf it was only 5 cents because it does not work !!! but I even had to pay $5 extra for shippingDont buy it sucks Sucks Sucks Amazon should be ashamed to sell this crapI rate it a ig Zero 0 Nothing Nada Warren111"
5,Natural History of Big Sur,"Great information for anyone wanting to explore the Big Sur area. As a backpacker, I enjoy knowing a little about what I encounter in the backcountry, and living in the Bay Area makes Big Sur a frequent destination. This book makes the information entertaining (and easy to remember) so I can share it with my hiking buddies on the trail."
5,Good choice,"I am beginner to intermediate level. Great book for me! Capablanca explains every move. I learned simple things I thought I knew, but in fact I never got completely. Making much less mistakes now and improved my play in very short time, because I start winning endgames against slightly better players where I never knew what to do before! There is an edited version available where only part of the text is Capablanca's original, but I don't know that one. This here is the original, only the notation is edited to algebraic, and I can really recommend this book!"
4,advice from a strong chess player,"There is plenty of good chess in the book. Capablanca is not as inspiring as Lasker or Nimzowitch, but the book is very instructive and gives a good taste of the thoughts of one of the strongest chess players in the history of the game."
4,"good, but not great","Great interviews mixed in with the narration. By the way, the narrator for the disc doesn't know how to speak Latin (domine is pronounced doh-mee-nay, NOT doh-myne)."
1,Dont get too exited kids,"Is everyone out there going mad - some crappy record company is releasing a Star Profile of Pink Floyd - so what ? Led Zeppelin have one the Beastie Boys have one (All Availiable from Amazon.com). Why does this bring out all the sad rumour mongers banging on about this being a new Floyd album - dont be so bloody silly.As for Waters re-joining the Floyd...Yes, and pigs might fly (right over Battersea Power Station).The Ginns"
3,HHmmmm...,Pink Floyd hasn't been featured on VH-1 behind the music... Rock-Line has a show about the best of Pink Floyd on Rock-Line... now this... something fishy is going on here...
1,What?,"i have a feeling this album isn't anything more than another interview disc, but if anyone has proof of my guess being wrong email me. The Pink fans out there would have known about this months ago i feel."
2,Not an official thingy.,"Relax folks, this is just a interview disk... these guys do 'star profiles' for dif bands... Floyd is one of them. It's not an official anything! I give it 2 stars just because of it's content. :)"
1,no good,"I just recently received this ""new pink floyd album"" and I do not recomend anyone else buying it. It is nothing more than an interview disc. Don't loose all hope though. There is something in the works, I just don't know what it is yet."
4,together we stand divided we still stand,david gilmour needs no help from anyone to write great music in perfect harmony with the earth..roger waters has no problem either...therefore my conclusion is 2 floyds are better than 1
1,There is no Pink Floyd to do a new album!,"The Luddites who say ""no Roger=no Floyd"" said that a long time ago. Now, finally, they're in step with reality. Pink Floyd formally disbanded after release of the ""Pulse"" live set. Their last studio album was ""Division Bell"". So now it's ""no Roger, no David, no Nick, no Rick....=no Floyd"". I only hope Gilmour has plans to do something solo the way he did during the '80s between Floyds."
3,Not a new Floyd !,"I hate to say this but all of us know that it's not a new Floyd album ! I look a that as a joke ! USE your brain.... new Floyd album called "" STAR PROFILE?"" STAR what ? Profile ! Even you can tell that by just looking at thr LIST PRICE of the album ! All of the Floyd (1 CD) albums have a list price of 16.97 ! now this one...... ! lol Pouyan http://CyberPink.tsx.org"
4,Crazy weirdo kills his crunch,"Juan Pablo Castel is a tormented and insane painter who falls for Maria, a woman he meets at an art exhibition. She is married to a blind man -the subject of Sabato and Saramago's obsession- and has a house in the countryside. She is also the mistress of her own cousin. Castel discovers this and goes mad with jealousy. We have no way to know the truth, because everything in the novel happens inside Castel's mind.When I first read the novel, in 1989, I thought it was a great psychological thriller, a true gem of existentialism. My praise for it has diminished, though, as I have come to dislike the guy. On a superficial level, it's just about the mad obsession of a lonely and depressive loser who is unable to cope with his passion and that leads him to commit a crime. If you find it profound and revealing, then enjoy it."
5,Reading this book was like attending a retreat.,"I have just completed this book. It had a profound effect on me, as I experienced some of the events and knew some of the characters, including the author and the subject, Ahjan Chah. I was even mentioned in the book. Reading it was like attending a retreat as it brought back so many memories and re-awakened so many spiritual principles and desires. If anyone wants an inside look on the Buddhist monkhood and religion, I enthusiastically recommend this book. It had a transformative effect on my heart and stimulated me to do my practice more diligently and consistently. Thank you, Paul Breiter."
2,could be better,"Pros: side buttons to toggle ring type and camera, very customizeable menu/key shortcut, search address bookCons: Mediocre itunes sound, bad picture quality, very limited video capture (30 seconds), slips out of your hands easily (don't consider myself clumsy but I've dropped it at least 10 times), software conflict w/T-mobile (you are sent extra blank txt message when you check your voicemail), battery life could also be better"
4,"My first ""cool"" phone","I have never purchased a phone, just picked whichever flip phone was free. This was the first time i paid ($100) for a phone because i am a fan of the razr and when i found out about the itunes version I jumped on it. Im only going to get into the itunes portion since you can read better reviews about the razr on other pages.itunespros: its sweet to have an ipod in the cellphoneease of usedecent sound quality, both out of the speaker and headphonescons: 100 song limitSLOW upload rate from computer, plan on an hour to fill your phone. But I dont change songs much so no real big dealheadphones supplied are not great, must use bluetooth connection, wish it had a headphone jackso overall i am very happy, cool lil gadget and for $100 I couldn't pass it up. Also the color of the cover is deceptive, its not silver but a cool gunmetal with a slight purple hue which is very nice."
1,sucked,phone seemed to be a knockoff. long pauses from when a key was pressed until the function started. could not make a call even though signal was present
2,jeepman,"I was looking for a basic phone with a good vibration ring/mode. I owned one of these several years ago and liked it. Well... this time, I wasn't impressed or it could have been the phone itself. The vibration .... not very good! So I returned it and was told that I should go to my AT&T service center and check-out some phones. Which I did... and found the Pantech 2000. It's a great, basic phone with very good vibration mode and many other features. It's nice to be able to get this unlocked phone and not have to re-up my service plan to do so!"
2,Not exactly what I expected.,"In every way, a really bad quality product. In the description was a complete cell phone set with accesories, but when I recieved it each piece has low quality to be a Motorola brand new product for the price. I am really dissapointed with the purchase, specially with the batteries that doesn't work properly."
5,It's A Book.,"I bought this for my girlfriend, who had recently got a job at a law firm. The book served it's purpose as a nice law reference."
3,"Good for an appetizer, where's dinner?","This cd has a few morsels that deserve mention. By The Clock - Baker Act makes you want another beer, so does Not Going Back by the Savoys. And the following song, You and Me by Moxie gets the alcohol flowing. But probably not enough to enjoy the rest of the menu. Appetizers and beer...where's my food? Closer Than You Volume I was much more digestible. Come on Florida--serve us dinner! Not musicians by day, waiters bynight."
3,"Solid product, but overpriced","Overall, a respectable product and perhaps the most durable one available. However, the quality of construction clearly was not in line with its high price tag. Also, the manufacturer put stickers in the bowls which left significant residue when removed, requiring us to wash/scrape them out before use."
3,Mixed up tracklist on the CD version,"First of all, when I bought this CD single and played it something was kinda fishy...and then I realised that the tracklisting was all messed up from the CD cover judging that the remixes sounded familiar and weren't in the correct order but you still have the enhanced video. The actual real tracklist on the CD are as follows1. Stole (The Gladiator Remix)2. Stole (D. Elliott Dreambrotha Mix)3. Stole (Maurice's Nu Soul Mix)4. Stole (Charlie's Nu DnB Mix)5. Stole (Bear Who? Nu Dnb Mix)6. Stole (Azza Nu Soul Mix)7. Stole (Enhanced Video)*I don't know what went wrong with the tracklist on the cover sleeve but something must've happened because after some listening and checking of a 12"" vinyl release of Stole the tracks on the cd sounded exactly the same as the ones on the vinyl. Onto the CD itself, the remixes were quite average and pretty subpar. The only one's that stood out to me were Charlie's Nu DnB Mix and Azza Nu Soul Mix.Overall 3/5 Stars."
1,do not buy this is junk,i got this ignition box and it never worked correct would be nice if it worked right msd is the way to go i wish i knew and dint spend my money on this other products may be good this is not one of mallory's good ones i had it installed in my 79 camaro and it was nothing but problems
5,"It's a yoga ball, plain and simple","I use it to substitute my office chair, used it for 8 months now, and it hasn't popped. Also great for bouncing on it, to relieve stress and annoy co-workers."
3,smelly and wrinkly,"I'm pretty sure I ordered a small pink ball but instead, I recieved a medium blue one. I tried going back to check my order but it doesn't specify.The hand pump is very handy and makes pumping easy (unlike my last one which required stepping on it) although pumping the ball was a workout in itself.I don't know if it's just my ball or if it's suppoed to be like this but my ball came with a very strong plastic smell and large wrinkles. Maybe they're supposed to go away with time?But the ball is very strong and fulfills its purpose.Oh and the plug for the hole doesnt go all the way in. But air doesn't seem to be leaking out and it doesn't get in the way."
3,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed about the quality of the pump and the ball. I needed a stronger pump to blow the ball up, the hand pump was a joke. Also, I find that I consitintly need to refill the air in the ball as it keeps leaking out."
3,"Despite Product Title, Didn't Come With A Pump","The yoga ball is fine, it is pretty hard to screw one up and was exactly what I expected; I did, however, think I was getting a pump with this and since I don't exactly have easy access to the store (I am deployed), I was midly irritated to find out that it didn't. Now I just have a flat yoga ball. Thanks for that."
5,Yoga Ball,I am satisfacted with my purchase. I got the yoga ball as a Christmas present for my sister and she had asked for one so the arrival and appearance of the ball is high quality. She is happy with her yoga ball.
1,Strong Smell,These yoga balls have a strong plastic smell out of the box. I returned mine right away and got one that is phthalate free.
1,Never received item,I did not receive the item. I have tried to contact the vender to track shipment with no response from them.
1,returned,Returned because the advertized size for my height wasn't big enough. Was well made and sturdy but not the right size
4,love it,a little bit smaller but it is all good but it comes with a hand pump and works great i love it
3,ORDERED 2 DIFFERENT COLORS AND SIZES...GOT 2 PURPLE..SMELLY,"These balls are ok, but I ordered 2 balls, 2 different sizes and 2 different colors. What I received was 2 purple balls-different sizes. Oh well, I like the color purple so that part worked out. However, they SMELL! After I inflated them they smelled so bad I had to leave them out in the garage for a couple of months. They're ok now."
2,"could be fantastic, could be","The quality of leather used for this is very nice, it feels nice, and it looks nice but there are a few problems. The plastic cover that covers your zune screen scratches (not as bad as similar the DLO case), this might not be a problem for those that just want audio but for video and pictures it gets annoying. The second is that there is a space in the leather for your play, pause, and wheel this would be fine but the buttons are so recessed that it's difficult to reach them if at all. Finally the price is high enough that I found it wanting and returned it. I suggest looking at the speck tough skin."
2,i don't like this very much,"Too self-promoting for their own good, Coldcut undermine their talent with stentorian showmanship and novelty. On ""let us play"", the experimentation pays off somewhat in ""beats and pieces"", and the bland lull of ""rubyaiyat"" melds languidly with the minor melancholy of ""pan opticon"", but these pleasures are small and short-lived; ""music 4 no musicians"" gives a good numbing, but i'd prefer a To Rococo Rot disc anyday. Worst is the prime wankery of ""i'm wild about that thing"" and ""every home a prison"", which bleat the group's love of didacticism -- music's ultimate spell-breaker. These guys obviously have strong opinions: maybe they should write manifestos instead of music ..."
3,Too mixed up...,"No offence to the artists - they're musical geniouses, but the music on these CD's is a bit to hard to get into... The samples in some songs seem merely novelty, and seem to serve no purpose but to keep with the theme... Brilliant in technicality, but without that melodic and rhythmical wholeness: it's without it's charm..."
5,Very pleased,"I purchased this camera recently, knowing nothing about minidv camcorders at all. I was happy to find it easy to use. The video quality is good but the still photo quality isn't so great. I don't use that feature much though so it isn't a big deal for me. I would certainly recommend this camcorder to others."
2,bad luck with my.,"Warning, this camcorder may not work with windows XP. I got this camcorder back in in November of 2006, I hooked it up to my PC, useing the firewire, my PC keeps saying it could not find any camcorder with 4 different programs that I tried. I got looking in the disk that came with it, and the disk is only for windows 2000, windows ME or a MAC. so I called Canon and they said they could not send me any other solution disk, there was nothing I could download for XP,they where of no help and with the disk, the programs keep poping up ""OS?"". other then that it takes great video, bad pictures, just don't hook it up to an old TV, you well get a really bad picture, you need a new TV or VCR that works with digital. the other bad thing is, if your camcorder breaks, and you have not found a way to download your tapes, then you have no way of watching them. so If yours work on XP your lucky."
5,DISCOVERY JOURNAL,"ADOLESCENTS NEED A REFUGE, A SAFE HAVEN WHERE THEY CAN PROCESS THEIR OFTEN CONFUSING AND CONFLICTING THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AND THIS DISCOVERY JOURNAL PROVIDES THAT SAFE HAVEN.PARENTS IF YOU WORRY ABOUT YOUR PRE-TEEN OR TEENAGER AND WISH THEY HAD AN AVENUE TO SAFELY EXPRESS WHAT THEY ARE FEELING AND YET LEARN ABOUT THEMSELVES THIS JOURNAL IS THE ANSWER.COUNSELORS AND SOCIAL WORKERS THIS IS A WONDERFUL TOOL TO USE IN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP COUNSELING.

O'S EXPERIENCE AND DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF CHILDREN COME SHINING THROUGH AS DOES HIS OPTIMISIM AND WARMTH."
3,"Good,but not that good",I bought this in retro after listening to mercenary but i must say it is not a patch on its successor.Starts off well but then starts to dip into cliche mode.Buy and stick with mercenary/massive attack etc.
3,Good,"The disc is almost new, very good condition, but the recording doesn't contain the three tracks mentioned, so that informations is wrong. It just contains ""All the love in your hands"" and a different track which is ""Spirit"""
2,bad light,I don't like this light. It doesn't give enough light to play well in the daytime. The glare is very bad. You should use a lamp.
4,A toast-worthy combination of ideals and results,"One of the few remaining artisan industries that caters to a mass market is winemaking and one of the best of breed in that space is Fetzer Vineyards. Fetzer's President, Paul Dolan has penned a book titled - ""True to Out Roots"" - where he explains six principles that guide his company and that can be used in any industry seeking to increase sustainability and growth. Soundview found this to be a fascinating book that showcases Fetzer's commitment to remain competitive in a hurly-burly business, while identifying growth opportunities and embracing green initiatives. Dolan shows how a company can both deliver on shareholder promises as well as its enduring promise to the community, employees and the environment. Dolan's blend of results and ideals are truly toast worthy!"
3,Mother Decides Years Later That Babies Were Murdered,"This book wasn't bad, but as true crime, it wasn't all that great. A lot like Garret Wilson himself; I could not see why women were fighting over him...it must be his charisma or something. I think he probably did murder both babies for the insurance money, but the evidence as presented in this book would not be enough for me to vote for conviction. Also, Missy wasn't that sympathetic a character, as it seems she didn't suspect her husband of murdering their baby until he left her for another woman. Then she gathered her info and recollections and began her crusade.This book didn't tie up all loose ends or erase all doubt, so to me, it was rather disappointing."
4,"A tool to move beyond 1,000 vocabulary","The book contains 1738 words that occur five or more times in the New Testament. There are quite a few books and Apps which cover words occurring 10 times or more. Beyond the first 1000 most frequent words, this is a book that provides a tool for targetting the next 738 words."
2,Children's Drawings as Diagnostic Aids,"This is an extremely expensive for what you get. The entire book took only an hour to read as most of it is illustration. I found the information to be outdated. Many of the theories have changed in the last 5 years. There is some ""food for thought"" but seemed mainly like common sense to me. I would check the local library prior to purchase."
3,"Good for class, not much else.","The book is a decent, well-written book for class, but for learning on one's own time, I wouldn't recommend it. It's really small and compact, which is great, but not the best for learning mathematics - it tries to keep things at as low of a level as possible for the reader, which actually put me off slightly."
2,Confusing and Incomplete,"This textbook lacks clear examples, explanations, and relevant homework problems. It will bog you down in lines of computations without adequate context. I don't recommend using this book, especially if you are trying to learn the material on your own. If you have to use it for a class, you have my empathy."
2,Not hard. The examples are usually good or ok. Exposition is awful.,"The problems are usually not hard. Some problems require a lot of algebraic manipulation.The examples usually cover most problems at the end of the chaper. Study the examples carefully and you should be able to do most problems.The exposition/explanation is poor. You just cannot understand what the authors are trying to say.Some problems are not explained in the text. For example, in section 1.2 there are a few problems about ""one-parameter family of solutions"", but the text does not have anything about ""one-parameter family of solutions"". Then you have to look up the definition online.If you are a student, you will have to consult online resources and other textbooks. If you are an instructor, please do not use this book. It will not help students learn."
2,Don't buy this book.,"This is definitely not written as an introductory text to differential equations. The theory is poorly explained and the examples are far from lucid. If you are a math major major and want to do some reading in your spare time buy it, otherwise just leave it on the shelf."
4,Differential Equations...,"Although this book is used in introductory differential equation courses, it contains too few worked examples to work as an introductory text. The student who uses this book should have some (not a lot, but some) background on the subject, even if they get that knowledge from the professor's lecture. My professor gave formulas for reduction of order and variation of parameters that were easier to use than those given in the book. Then again, he explained the topic so well that I hardly had to use the book except for homework, and I still got an A+. The book is well written, but perhaps better suited for an intermediate differential equations course."
3,Good for the author alone?,This book seems more than adequate for those who already have a hold on advanced mathematics and want a comprehensive guide to a new subject. The layout is utilitarian and serves well enough...
3,college book,needed it for a class. was able to get it super cheap. a few highlights and took a long time to ship. but worth it for the price of $1.20 as opposed to a $120 math book.
2,Not good,"It is not soft at all, can't believe it is 1000 counts. My 300 counts are better than this. I don't think it is Egyptian cotton, not even close."
5,They are the best wheets I have ever slept on!,They are soft and think. They are sure to last for a long time probably longer than I would even imagine. Easy to wash and keep clean. It's nice that they are fitted for 20 inch matresses as this is hard to find and with such good quality and pricing!
4,Good transaction,Everything was good in this transaction except delivery time.It took more than two weeks to receive it after I ordered this book.
3,More Than I Needed,"My fault - I need to read details of purchases more carefully. What I got was the full score for the opera - which is what they say it is. Full meaning all the orchestration as well as the singers. More than I needed.And as orchestral reprints go, not terribly well done. The print quality is light and not very crisp, and since the size is small, one really would like a clear and crisp print.For those who need a full orchestral read of the opera, - I've seen worse. But it's too small to actually use in production, and more than I needed. This will sit on the music bookshelf and will probably never be opened again. Maybe I could press leaves..."
3,Akotcha - Sound Burger,"A good -- if not particularly distinguished -- album from the Pork camp. Produced by Hefner, Sound Burger shows some of the darkness that would appear on Russ Jones' later work as Victor Malloy, but not as much complexity. Still, a number of pleasant tracks in appearance here, including ""So Far So Good"" and ""We Have the Technology."""
2,Great service! Horrible quality!,"This product came pretty fast, but the product itself wasn't as great. It's pretty good for an amp of its size, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything other than a little practice amp. The amp itself is made out of the cheapest plastic you can find!!! Seriously it broke in a week and now I'm using duct tape on it just so the battery can stay in! There's better amps, go look around a bit more"
3,The Price is Just About Right,"Is the JamPlug cheap? Yes -- very glad I wasn't one of the poor folks who paid $50 for it.Is it cheaply made? Yes -- the battery compartment lid cracked the first time I used it, and has been held on with gaffer's tape ever since.Does it work as advertised? Yes, pretty much. You get the one thumbwheel volume control (not, as one reviewer somehow thought, separate volume and distortion controls). If you do as another reviewer said and play with the JamPlug volume control in concert with the volume control on your guitar/bass, you will be pleasantly surprised with the results, I think.Does it hum? Yes, a little, and that can be a bit annoying, but not (for me at least) a deal-breaker.Would I buy one again? Yes. It stays in my bass case and comes out at frequent intervals -- like when I practice and don't want to annoy the apartment-building neighbors.Bottom line? Your money's worth for around eight bucks."
1,Please retire,Brian Wilson should hang up his spurs and live on the memories of the Beach Boys. It's unfortunate that we remember Brian from his latest attempts rather than the harmonies of the superb Beach Boys.
2,Better than Silence,"I didn't feel that this collection was worth a listen or even came close to ever being one of my ""must have"" Christmas CDs. I bought it on a whim and because I have always liked the Beach Boys sound and that other reviewers had given it high marks. Not my favorite Christmas CD by a long shot. It just sounded like the effort from a tired, burnt out, has- been who needed a little cash."
1,Screw Copy Protection!,"What a bummer! With this miserable copy protection nonsense I couldn't even listen to Amazon song samples on my Mac. Brian, say it isn't so and tell Arista to stop screwing with your music."
5,THIS IS NOT A COPY PROTECTED CD!,"Some people talk about Copy Protection of this CD...As I received the CD from Amazon, searching for the words ""Copy Protected"" onCD jacket and back but didn't find any caution.Just put CD into CD-ROM of my xp PC / Mac and nothing happened.My PC has no magic at all!Is it only for me? no no no.I finally transfer all songs to iPod and am having good time with Brian's wonderful Christmas songs.Anyway, the package of this CD is too cheap, isn't it?No inlay, no further information about album recording...Nothing but only Digipack like Maxi single CD!Comparing previous releases from Nonesuch, it's too poor.Though I appreciate Brian, I ask Arista make it more better!"
5,WOW! Get Christmas Joy with Brian Wilson's CD,"Are you tired of Christmas commercialism? Are you not as joyful as you would like to be at this time of year and you don't like cold weather? Is your Christmas list for those who already have everything so you have no idea what to get them? Well Brian Wilson (formerly of the Beach Boys and their founder)has just the gift for you and your friends and family,Brian's CD, WHAT I REALLY WANT FOR CHRISTMAS. It has real carols, such as Joy to the World, O Holy Night, Hark the Herald Angels Sing and others. To keep you from feeling down to feeling way UP HIGH(without getting into Uncle Jim's special eggnog)Brian's original brand new songs, Christmasey and What I Really Want For Christmas will warm you right up. I dare you to listen to Little St. Nick and The Man With All the Toys and others without tapping your toes. Sing along to We Wish You A Merry Christmas and you'll find that Brian Wilson's CD will make your holiday full of joy."
5,KYB the best strut for the price,"When I needed to buy struts for my Celica, I researched Toyota blogs to find out the performance and quality various brands offered. When I decided that KYB was the way to go, I found that Amazon offered the best price and free shipping...better than eBay or any other internet or brick & mortar seller. I will let you know how well these KYBs work out after some time hitting the curves hard in my Celica! You can't beat Amazon...best sellers, best shipping, best warranty!"
3,Text book,"This is a text book for a person looking to gain the information provided in this book. I used it during a Math 109 course, which is Finite Math for the University I attend. Some of the information can be found quickly and with no effort but other information seems more difficult to follow. Depending on your level of study if this book is required and you can get it for less than $10 I highly suggest it."
4,Informative: Gives new insight into the mind of Darlie,"I had a hard time putting this book down once I started reading it. I read this book in hopes of learning why Darlie would do such a thing to her own children. Although it gives the reader no answers, it does give us new insight into Darlie's state of mind on that night. I respect very much the way the family stood up for their own, but there comes a time when they must finally accept the truth about what happened."
3,It's not as bad as everybody else says,"I have read the four books so far published on the Routier case, and I'll admit, I found this one to be the most biased against Darlie Routier. I still found it to be a good read, although I'm certain she is innocent of the horrible crime of killing her two young sons. I have read too much of the evidence that has been made public to believe anything else. I think Springer is a pretty good true crime author but it is obvious she believes Routier is guilty, as opposed to the other authors, namely, Don Davis, Barbara Davis and Christopher Brown. I don't, however agree with most of the reviewers who want to nail her to a cross. I have had a fascination with this case since I read Davis' ""Precious Angels"". I don't know how anyone who has seen the crime scene photos could believe she did it. Read ""Media Tried, Justice Denied"". You'll know what I'm talking about."
3,One for the Prosecution,"If you already believe that Darlie Routier is guilty, that her husband is pristinely innocent, and that the state of Texas is never wrong, this is the book for you. The author leaves no doubt that she believes these things. Nevertheless, Springer provides an interesting read, including a compelling account of events on the night of the murders, a well written - albeit obviously biased - explanation of the police investigation, and a blow-by-blow description of the trial itself. The book also contains a few innocuous photographs of investigators, the prosecution team, and some of the marches and protests organized by the pro-Darlie camp.The book is entertaining, but readers who are searching for a more objective approach to the subject would be better served by reading Don Davis' book, Hush Little Babies."
5,This was a book I could not put down.,After reading Pat Springer's first book BLOOD RUSH I couldn't wait to read her next book. I wasn't disapointed. The book was very well written and you could tell Springer had done her homework.
4,Pat Springer Got It Right,"Springer did an excellent job getting to the details and reporting the facts straight in this horrible crime. Pat attended the trail and interviewed all the key players. Of all the books on the case, this has to be one of the best. This is why it was selected as Webslueths.com favorite."
1,Don't waste your money,"My shelves are full of true crime and I was excited to get this since I had heard alot about the case. It is poorly written and very poorly edited. I can honestly say this will go in my ""worst of"" sections. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Another Springer - kin to Jerry??,"This has to be a kin of Jerry Springer and likes to sensationalize on fabrications that are exampled in her book. You would think this writer knew the family personally the way she attacks them. Funny how Devon and Damon Routier are barely mentioned in any of the books that are based on Routier. Infact the Routier family's lives were built around these little boys and to say otherwise is a blatant lie. Wonder how much credit we can give to any of these books when they were based on a transcript that can not even be certified because of so many mistakes made by the court reporter. You certainly have some ""readers"" and ""critics"" that have reviewed this book without so much as looking at any facts on this case. I have conversed with some that are so ""narrow-minded"" that they can't see past the end of their noses. Even with proof and pictures and DNA evidence, these ""Springer Fans"" stick to their fantasies. Maybe they should sign up to work with Jerry."
1,Judgmental with a capital J!,"I'm a huge fan of true crime books but I must say this book sounded like a gossip column. Authors are suppose to be unbiased but this one is not only biased, she is hateful toward the VICTIMS, yes - the victims in the story. F&B is a prime example of how NOT to write."
1,I hope the others are better!,"I'm a novice as far as Darlie Routier Saga is concerned. I was watching Leeza Gibbons this week and saw Christopher Brown, the Routiers and Barbara Davis and Bill Lane on it. Curiousity sent me to the bookstore. Precious Angels was sold out and on order; Media Tried Justice Denied had not arrived yet, but I did find a bunch of copies of Flesh and Blood so I didn't have much choice but to start there. I was really disappointed in Ms. Springer's writing and story telling ability. It was very distracting. I hope the other two books don't disappoint me like this one. I was especially impressed with how together Ms. Davis was on Leeza. I hope that's an indication that her book will be good. I've read the reviews and they give me promise."
1,The crime commited was this book,"This book is full of mis information and mistakes. Save your money. This is not a true representation of the facts at all, just an outlet for gossip and half truths."
1,"Terrible, biased","The books isn't too badly written, but very poorly edited. I've worked in law enforcement and emergency medicine for some time and I can't believe that anyone could believe this woman was guilty. There is absolutely no evidence to support it. What evidence there was shows just the opposite."
1,You Call This A Book?,"This Has to be the worst and I strss WORST book(If you want to call it that) I've ever had the misfortune of reading. This book was hateful and written with overwhelming bias. I was ashamed to have wasted my money, however, I felt a little better about spending the cash after I dicovered that Pat Springer's book makes for wonderful liner in my cat's litter box....the cat had no problem putting the book to it's obviously intended use. Don't waste your money...this book is pure trash! And what kind of person is Pat Springer....what made her such a hateful, spitefull person? Ms. Springer could have written her book without the hatred and gotten her point across just the same. Other recommended uses for this book include: good for those cold nights by the fire(really keeps the fire going-this book burns and burns and burns), can also be used as toiletpaper as well as the above suggested use in the kitty litter box."
3,Hush Little Babies was better,"I think Hush Little Babies was better written although I also liked this book as well. Hush Little Babies appeared to be somewhat more objective to the extent that it set forth the State's position and Darlie Routier's position. This book seemed to have little criticism of the State while portraying Darlie's family as a bunch of loose cannon nut jobs with extreme tunnel vision. There were a few typographical errors and some factual errors (Darlie's birthday at least twice was set forth as January 1st, which apparently is Darin Routier's birthday while Darlie's birthdate most often has been given as January 4, 1970). However, I believe both books were worth reading. I don't believe that either book gave any really great insight as to why Darlie killed the two boys although the reader in each instance is left with some intriguing possibilities."
2,Poor,"I have to agree that this book was poorly written and VERY biased. Unbelievable that the publishers would allow it to go to publishing like this, it's so blatant that it doesn't even make an attempt to hide the venomous attacks and outright lies. No Darlee Rutier is not a very sympathetic character but I do not think she was proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."
2,If you have an IQ above 70-This book is your worst nightmare,"Did Patricia Springer and/or her editor actually read the first draft of this book or just rush it into publication? I counted a total of six typos-there is just no excuse for that in my opinion. The book itself, typos aside, is extremely biased at best. Patricia Springer seems to interject an awful lot of her own assumptions into the story. I found this distracting and unprofessional. Bottom line, very sad and mysterious story that could have been written a lot better."
2,Disappointing,This book was not well-written or edited. Lots of misspellings and misinformation. All in all I was disappointed.
1,Disappointing read,"Although this event captured my attention, this book did not. I was throughly disappointed with Ms. Springer's telling of it."
3,Not Soble's best,"An interesting read, the book is very categorically divided into two almost unrelated sections: one on sex and the other on love. One would have expected such an expert dealing more specifically with the relationship between the two. As a general treatise, surely, I have read better works - even if considerably shorter - by Alan Soble. For instance, what Soble calls the ""metaphysics of sexuality"", and his very apt distinction between ""metaphysical sexual pessimism"" and ""metaphysical sexual optimism"", are practically absent altogether. The title of the book purports to be the (why not ""a"") philosophy of sex and love (together or separately?), but rather disappoints as a philosophical treatise. Notwithstanding, coming from such a brilliant expert on the subject, this book is not to be missed by anyone interested in the themes dealt with. It includes some very interesting discussions as well."
1,Needed more editing but had potential.,"Review by Karen: Harlan Michaels is an attorney handling the lawsuit against the company manufacturing the faulty tire that killed his client's family. Lana Stewart is a therapist who works with children; in this case, the child whose family was killed by a faulty tire on a passing truck. He's not a fan of commitment. She wants to fall in love with someone like Cary Grant - at least the characters he portrayed in his movies. It's an interesting premise.I think there will be people that like this story; it's a romance with a little suspense and a happy ending. I found Waiting for Cary Grant to be very difficult to read. The formatting seemed to be off and made it confusing to follow. There were numerous occasions where I had to stop and re-read a passage a couple of times in order for it to make sense. These things detracted from the story for me."
5,Very inspiring,I loved this book... it allows for the possibility that there is an explanation for all that happens negatively in this world. Being a story allows you to become involved and gives hope.
5,An interesting story of a woman's spiritual journey.,"I enjoyed reading this story very much. It was interesting to read the personal story of Sincerly Young and her search for meaning in a life that was full of questions, and conflicts. I especially enjoyed her talk with Yahwah and the chance hopefully to get answers to life's more difficult questions. I would recommend this at many levels: the individual reading for pleasure, as a good story. The person who is involved in an abusive relationship, looking for ideas to help them and others. It would also be good for a general research discussion, used in half-way houses or counseling situations. Enjoy the read!"
1,Wrong Shoes,"The shoes I that arrived were threadless, not the threaded shown on the page. Mighty careless of Amazon. I sent them a correction, but the page was still wrong the last time I looked."
1,Picture does not show cantilever brakepads !!!,"I've can't comment on whether these brakes pads are good or not, as I bought them from the picture alone without reading the title. These ARE cantilever pads as described in the text, NOT v-brake shows as depicted in the photo."
3,Very good aftermarket pads,Shipping was adequate. I bought them as hardware backups for other Kool Stop pads but I would have liked to have been able to purchase extra nuts and bolts without having to buy the extra pads.
5,Lasts and lasts,"I've put over 1,200 miles on these pads road riding, mountain biking and flat ground goofing off. During the time i've had these pads i've had to replace both the cassettes, 2 chains, one rim, 2 tires 2 seat posts and 2 seats and still only one of the 4 is worn out! I'm definitely buying them again! And they have great breaking power."
4,Excellent Educational Source!!,"I was very Impressed by how thorough the chapters were, not unlike previous nail technician books i have read. This has a good in depth look at the natural nail and it's structure, nail diseases and disorders, then also has a chapter dedicated to each stage of applying artifical nails along with some good practice tips.This book also has a great introdution to nail art, with some great designs and instructions for beginners.Overall i would recomend this book highly to people who are studying to be a tech and also to qualified techs as a reference book."
4,"Janet Jackson's ""Together Again""","""Together Again"" (Track #1, the Radio Edit) is one of Janet Jackson's best and catchiest songs. Janet Jackson's heart-felt tribute to a lost loved one is very uplifting and is set to a bright club beat. However, the bright club beat does not take away from the original intent of this dedication to the loved one. I think this song is so appealing because it's a dedication that isn't dark or gloomy. Rather, it makes people want to sing along, dance, and feel good."
5,I've Found a World......,"I fell in love with the band Evanescence in high school when a friend introduced me to the band's albums Origin and Fallen, and it's been true love ever since. As with any true Evanescence fan, when I heard the news that a new song was going to be released I knew that I had to have it. I was not disappointed. Together Again is haunting, right from the opening notes. Lee's vocals are, as usual, impeccable; the lyrics incredibly heartfelt. ""I've found a world where love and dreams and darkness all collide, maybe this time, we can leave our broken world behind"", Lee sings, and those few lines became the lyrics to my summer. The fact that the song was released in an effort to help the victims of the Haitian earthquake make an already amazing song even more stellar. Together Again helps to bridge the gap for the fans that have been waiting since The Open Door....and will continue to wait until that new album is released in October. :)"
2,May turn your finger green,I purchased this item for my sister-in-law's birthday. She picked the ring out herself. She has had it for about 6 months now. It has begun turning her finger green. I think the manufacturer needs to do a better job of coating the ring with silver.
3,"wanted more stories, less theory","The first 60 pages are hysterically funny descriptions of yobs behaving badly. The remainder gets bogged down in theorizing. This book is classified as a sociology book, remember. The author's descriptions of what it feels like to lose your identity in a mob are pretty interesting. Almost one of a kind, I would expect. Not many editors of Granta voluntarily join football mobs having a runny riot, I should expect."
5,Soccer Fans run amok!,"Anglophiles beware. Buford is gonna give you good reason to sneer at the awsome, awful, antics--no atrocities--committed in the name of sport by Brit soccer fans. We've got face-painting and the wave. They've got trampling, deadly stampedes, hotel larceny, and attempted murder, and thats just in the first quarter.This guy Buford is good, reads like fiction (in a good way); you can feel the fat blokes in the crowd crushing in on you, hear the screams of their not-always-innocent victims, and smell the beer, and the vomit.I was laughing during the first chapter. But by the time I hit the eyeball chomping bit, I was pretty well laughed out. You'll be tempted to pass along your copy to friends, resist that, keep it around to shut- up any Eurotrash bigmouths who may wander through"
4,An outsider's view - that works!,"Picked up the book - an American author? forget it! But I decide to carry on, being ""actively"" involved as an English supporter in the eighties I was interested. I agree with another reviewer, people will bs, he does appear naive in some areas but that works for the book. When he describes how badly behaved our fans were, it's embarassing, but at the time it meant nothing to us. One very important point (US readers take note) the deaths and diasters that took place were not really hooligan related but bad policing and organization. Buford account of Sardinia is so powerful. I must have read it 20 times. I was there and he really describes the frustration of being treated like animals and then the violence. Us in shorts the police with batons ect. Bottom line, only a few people were real wankers, most wanted a laugh but it got too serious. The author met a few head bangers and top fans- good book. You can't make an omlette without breaking a few eggs!"
3,Strong . . . then weak . . . then Strong . . . then,"As documentary history, there are times when it's nearly impossible to put 'Among The Thugs' down. His ability to articulate his vantage while things go off is unmatched. However, as the book goes on (and it's short; some 315 pages) it's too easy to tire of him. His theory become pedantic, and he's so intent on it he's willing to risk the final chapters, which sink under their sociology lesson and hammed-up moral controversies. At times, it's easy to wonder whether an editor read the last two chapters at all. That said, Buford reveals much that British accounts of their hooligan shame either downplay or exaggerate . . . even if he works in the shadow of Heysel and Hillsborough. In fact, his lack of contact with Liverpool supporters nearly negates his whole work. But that's another story -- since the Reds haven't been honest with their roles in those events, either."
3,Absolute rubbish,"I don't know how this guy spent so much time with these ""thugs"" and had so little understanding of them. He even confesses at the beginning of the book that his motivation for writing the book was lack of understanding. I've been attending premiership matches for a number of years (mostly London games) and the fans, especially Chelsea fans, will tell an American journalist anything if they think it'll get them a laugh or get their name in the paper. A responsible journalist will treat unsubstantiated claims with extreme caution. I feel that Buford fell for the jokes hook line and sinker. Where the book is valuable is Buford's own personal experiences. The account of his being beaten by Italian police in the world cup was perhaps the best written personal view of football violence that I've read."
3,Similar To Gawking At A Fatal Car Crash,"As an Englishman living in Los Angeles, I have often attempted unsucessfully to communicate to American friends the mentality and culture surrounding English football (soccer) violence. Buford does a fine job in bridging that gap, and bares not a little of himself when revealing how prone most of us can be to the thrill of being part of an out-of-control group. Buford gets swept along with the thugs and clearly begins to enjoy the sensation. What the author fails to capture is how great a part ritual and stylization play in the violence. For as frightening as it is to observe, football hooliganism has a long, long way to go before it reaches the insanity of the literal street wars of America's gang culture with it's ubiquitous fatal outcomes. I lend this book to Americans now, rather than trying to describe football hooliganism. They love it."
1,Not Accurate.,"I was there and this book is not accurate and does not represent what was going on in English Football at the time. For excellent alternatives try Steaming-In, Hoolifan, 'Armed For The Match' or 'Congratulations you just met the ICF'.It's a well written book, but as is documented in other books on the subject, he never had any contact with any of the top faces on the scene (why not read a book by one of them that are available), nor was he ever involved in any major incidents. In the book he talks about people as if he knew them, but is relaying stories he was told by wannabes. Likewise he tells a story of a Millwall fan attacking a West Ham fan based on a newspaper account as if he was there (a very poor thing to do in a book like this).However it is well writen, and an interesting account from an outsider - just beware of the taking contents as fact."
4,"Compelling, but disturbing","Extremely interesting, well-told story of the author's experience of the culture of football holligans in the UK. Disturbing to learn about the level of violence. It was an entertaining and compelling read, but ultimately left me a little sadder about human nature (and maybe a little wiser)."
2,Great work of fiction,"I think the author here either has some major issues ne needs to deal with . The kind of people described here in the book are about 1 1,000th of how british soccer fans are .This is a very insulting to anyone born in the Uk"
1,Hooligans???,"Bill Buford makes a laughable attempt to write a hooligan book. I thought this book was terrible. I wanted to read about hooligans, instead I read about his philosophical ideas on crowds and people. What a joke! A waste of money, I recommending not buying this book."
1,How can you people be fooled by this garbage?,"Quite how or why this book has come to in any way regarded as a meaningful work on the culture of soccer hooliganism escapes me because it is quite simply laughable.The quality of the writing is fine (as it should be for a former editor of Granta) but as anyone who knows anything about soccer in England will be aware, outsiders are rarely, if ever, tolerated by the gangs and journalists are universally hated which calls into question just how factual some of this book really is. As an Englishman, I actually found some of it quite insulting.Read the excellent Barmy Army or Everywhere We Go (Doug Brimson) or Guv'Nors (Micky Francis) to read what really makes English hooligans tick."
2,"Disturbing, but for different reasons","An account of an American intellectual who submerges himself in the common rubble to learn their horrible violent, racist ways. Interestingly, each chapter is preceded by a small clippet from Victorian accounts that define and demonize the mob, i.e., the working people. Equally disturbing are author's metaphors that consistently compare people with animals. This book is exaggerated and indeed fabricated for the most part. Does violence occur during football matches--yes it does. But the author makes no attempt to explain this behaviour on a personal level; he views it as mob mentality. Furthermore, it downright insulting to the British public, which may or may not be a good thing. It is interesting, but the tone of the book is not objective--it's an elitist account, written in inflated diction, of an upper class professional ""trying"" to understand the vulgar culture of the masses--culture that is made of thugs, Nazis, and alcoholics, according to the writer."
4,Very entertaining!,"Buford's writing style in Among the Thugs allows the reader to immerse himself into the characters. The tales of football supporters on the terraces, at the pubs, and on the opposition's turf is engrossing. The reader can feel the adrenaline of the men in the book, and Buford's obervations are very funny. Reminiscent of Heller in Catch-22."
3,Entertaining - But Lacks Depth Or a Convincing Conclusion,"As a tour of several football grounds in England in the company of Hooligans , Buford's book is at times engaging and interesting. As a sociological study of the causes of mob violence as represented by these incidents it falls flat. I had very mixed feelings about this book. He seems to be driving to the conclusion that people in mobs conform to a ""crowd"" mentality and do very bad things they wouldn't do on their own. A fairly obvious conclusion wrapped in pseudo-intellectual language. He's at his best when describing his own participation in some of these confrontations. Read it for the description of the incidents themselves and you'll learn something without needing to be dragged to some profound understanding of what it all means."
4,Attack of the Yobos,"Excellent take from an outsider (a yank at that) on football hooligan culture. More of a sociology book, but has some very good stories.Entertaining and a very easy read.One of the essential reads if you want to know more about the mindset of the yobos."
2,"Not for Jewish, Christian or Muslim Believers","This book is fine, as long as you do not believe the Old Testament to be true as history or theology."
2,Very Disappointing,This book was very disappointing. It was written in a stream of consciousness style with bizarre attempts to integrate modern analogies and to compare David to modern figures from unrelated fields. I had the feeling that it was written in one weekend without the scholarly research for which I would have hoped.
3,Animals On Wheels - Cooked,"Animals on Wheels' first trip from Bovinyl to Ninja Tune came with COOKED. And even though ""Eggshell"" would find its way onto the debut album, it's worth listening to twice, a jazz-step trip. If you like the more melodic bits, ""Dog Car Boy"" fits the bill, and if you prefer the wilder rhythms and frenetic beats, ""Invert and Click"" will do you good. There's also some weirdo jazz with ""Play with Words"" and wobbly funk on ""Back for More."" Who knew animals could groove so much?"
2,Please give me my root canal so I can leave,"Ok, now that I have left the dentist and the root canal is good, but that Mum music just killed me. See, the Dr. uses Mum to put patients to sleep. I thought Sigur Ros and Polyphonic Spree were unbearable...well now I have discovered a new nemesis, Mum. My mum told me not to accept rides from strangers, so I am telling you not to accept music from Mum."
5,favorite toy,I have a black lab that loves to play. This is my dog's favorite toy!! I have bought several of them for her.
3,Dog loves them,My dog loves these hedgehogs. He has one for inside and outside. They aren't as durable as I'd like them to be but that's ok as long as he's happy
5,Almost lasted 6 months,Well it lasted 6 months so I'm giving it a 5 star rating. Our large alpha male husky is notorious for not allowing a squeaker to live peacefully inside anything within his reach. It was great while it lasted - he carried in around and slept near it and loved to play fetch with it.
5,"Great price, Great toy,",My dogs LOVE this toy and to find it for such a GREAT price-WOW. I was able to get 2 for a little more than what I pay for 1. I will return to this vendor again.Thanks
4,Great toy!,"This hedgehog was a success in my house. I have three Pekingese boys that love their toys and when I brought this home, they were all over it. They love for me to throw it and they carry it around. Unfortunately, they liked his nose the best and have since chewed that off with a few of his legs. They love his squeaks and they killed the squeaks (as they do with most every stuffed toy that has squeaks in it) within the first day of having it, but the fact that they still played with it after the squeaks were gone shows that this toy is excellent. Recommend it for sure :)"
3,Loved. But destroyed.,"Mickey , our beagle, loved his hedgehog. I've never seen him enjoy a dog toy so much. But...... After only 5 days he managed to tear off the nose and end his relationship with hedgehog. Very sad. I would suggest that the nose be reinforced more like a dog toy than a child's stuffed animal. Not quite sturdy enough for a fun loving beagle."
3,XLarge DELUXE Grunting Hedgehog II (Gray),"I gave this to my GSD and he loves it, the only problem is the grunt, and squeal noise makers didn't function very long. He loves the toy !"
1,This compilation should be banned!,"do not even look at this - as an Oldfield fan i must say that even ""elements"" 1 disc edition was better.this is missing almost 30% of his career....where is ""five miles out""? where is ""family man""? where is ""Shadow on the wall""? where is ""Islands""?Mixing New-age stuff from nineties with his old style is a really bad bad bad idea...I know that this collection was a kind of introduction to his new stuff but warner did it in tragic style.the only good think is the Excerpt from ""Tubular bells 3"" with Mike's vocals.it is diferent version - but it is not saving whole album...horible compliation!"
4,FUN and totally absorbing,I am hooked on this series and so is my husband. Amazing that he can keep it all going through all these books. I am now on to book 5!
1,knowsthetruth,"Unfortunately this so called man, uses his intellectuallism as a weapon against others. Notice ""non practicing lawyer"". This failure as a human being likes to hold himself above all others while the only time he was ever witnessed being a father to two children who turned out to be losers, was when he waged a bullying war along with one of them against my daughter. He's a coward that hides behind his big words. A true failure."
3,"Too much mindless, upbeat new jack swing stuff here.","But between the tracks you obviously have to fast forward through are some great midtempos and ballads. ""Weak"" has always been a beautiful song. It was written by Brian Alexander Morgan who wrote many of the album's songs. ""Right Here"" (Human Nature Radio Mix) is also amazing. The original not so much. And that's the problem with this album. There's too much new jack swing filler that takes away from the album's charm. I'm shocked at all the 4 and 5 star reviews. But hey. No two people have the same tastes.The girls can obviously sing. However, the props mainly go to lead singer Coko. Her voice is always at the forefront and for good reason. There was just too many boring upbeat tracks here to hold much interest though. I was honestly using the skip button a lot on Spotify. If you want my opinion, don't get this album just download the singles. Sad? Yes. But it's the truth.Worst track: Blak Pudd'n3 stars."
3,pretty good,this is all you will ever need by them.there best songs are all on this disc.weak is a good cut.this album had some impact with other Female groups that came after them.some of the stuff works others don't.the material is alright.the vocals are hit&miss at times.
3,Fair,"This is the only cd you need fom the band, it has the best 3 or 4 songs they released. Its a good listen for the low price I see it being sold at."
4,Sisters with Voices,I love SWV. I had this cd way back in the day..and I misplaced it so I decided to buy it again..I had to do it. I hate that they broke up but this is one of my all time favorites..some of my favorite songs areWeakYour always on my mindIts about time- thats my favorite songThats what I need.SWV is ol' school but if you aint hip to them then this cd would be a good start.
3,honest,"Who doesn't remember 'weak'? This girl group was very good, I don't know why they broke up but they were good."
5,CJ7 windshield frame,"Just as I expected, fit like a glove. Ordered item and received it within a week. Packaged great and without any damage."
1,This book SUX!!!,"I am an avid reader, consuming at least 3 a week and I can't believe I wasted time reading this book. The author does not have a gift for storytelling and he has added elements that were totallly irrelevant to the story line. The murder of children could have been left out and he still could have told a story of political intrigue. This authour should be ashamed of himself and look for a new profession!!"
1,What the ? ? ?,"Convoluted and over the top. Hard to follow plot and stock-type or unidentifiable characters. Good title, bad book."
4,Interesting Psychological Study,"This novel follows the progress of a woman who is left by her husband with only her servant. She vows never to be poor again, and climbs her way back up the social ladder by using men and her body. The novel, while possibly intended as a conduct book to show women what happens to those who sin, reads today as a portrait of a woman trapped between society's views and her own upward movement. A very interesting, and at times disturbing, read."
4,"Defoe, an early feminist?","I read this having recently enjoyed Moll Flanders. They are very different, Moll's story is something of a bawdy, satirical comedy, whereas Roxana's is a tragic tale. I think that other reviewers have perhaps missed the irony that is inherent in Defoe's work. While presenting these tales of 'fallen' women as confessions of repentence, I think that was something of a cover, without which his novels would have been unacceptable to his contemporary audience. He creates strong, autonomous women, driven by economics. He does not judge them and because of that neither do we. Was he in fact an early feminist? He believed strongly in the education of women and advocated equality in marriage in 'Conjugal Lewdness.' I think Roxana is an extention of those ideas."
5,A way with words,"Daniel Defoe has a way with words, lovely piece of words. I would advise you to read this book slowly to eat up the words."
2,Cartoonish,An early novel from Charles Sheffield. A future history after a nuclear war. Rather cartoon-like character development and plotting.
2,Tedious,The book was wriiten as a response to the ideas of some other thinkers who have written on the subject of evolution notably Gould. It would have been a much better book if it had been a good pamphlet. The same ideas a restated over and over again in Dennet's usual tedious prose. The ideas are good but good have been amply stated in a brief white paper instead of a book length repitition.
5,Most complete round up of Darwinian thinking there is,"A brilliant book, brimming with historical details on the origins of and the reaction to Darwin's ideas."
2,"arrogance goes with the territory, but hypocrisy is too much","Despite Dennett's smug tone, this wide-ranging study of the nature and influence of evolutionary theory does benefit from his philosophical analysis. Particularly interesting for me, as someone who works with probabilities, was his description of 'actualism', the doctrine that '_only_ the actual is possible'; ie anything which did not happen _could_not_ have happened. However, I couldn't stomach Dennett's sustained personal attack on Stephen Jay Gould, and stopped reading at the description of his supposed 'bully-pulpit'. I suggest you read both authors and decide for yourself who's the bully."
2,A simplistic view of Darwinism,"Oh boy, this book is baaaad. A simplistic view of Darwinism wrapped in a pedantic package. Stay clear of it."
2,The lost idea!,"This book is what one would typically expect from an intellectual who holds onto ideas far beyond their time. His explanation of natural selection is about five miles behind the advances in biological research. The only dangerous idea in the book is the one left out. Natural selection, nor biological explanations, by themselves, cannot rid us, nor explain, the rich content and processes of consciousness. Dennett has failed to explain away consciousness, and he has also failed to explain what consciousness is. One is left with no new information."
5,Got to read it,"All I can say is that after reading this book, I had to read all of Daniel's other books. Very well written book and it makes you realize that no matter how well you know evolution, there are some clever implications of evolutionary algorithm that you may not have considered in the past."
4,Complex and Entertaining,"While Dennett comes off, at times, sounding pompous and headstrong, that may simply be because he is, in my opinion, correct about certain aspects of the human mind's ability to cope with conflicting beliefs. My personal religious beliefs aside, I do feel that, at a point, religion and evolutionary science do come into direct conflict. Some of Dennett's thoughts and ideas, in conjunction with Dawkins's ideas, can run a little wayward of what I would call science, but simply because the ideas are blended with speculation and opinion. For further reading on the evolutionary perspective of religious thought, I would recommend Scott Atran and Pascal Boyer. Again, I really enjoyed the book, my personal disagreements notwithstanding."
3,"A good, but overly scientific, introduction","Dr. Dennett's work is a good introduction to the idea of evolution and its resultant consequences. As a Catholic theologian-in-training, I found his discussion on the moral and ethical implications of evolution lucid and well-argued. Getting to that part of the work, however, was an issue. Having had difficulties in science courses in school, I found his scientific discussions of the Tree of Life, among other subjects, to be something that must be slugged through.On the whole, I give Dr. Dennett high marks for examining the theory of evolution with an objective and logical eye. While his opinions and viewpoints are not absent from the text, they are most often supported with logical or scientific evidence. Though it does get mired in scientific language, I recommend this book to those that wish to better understand evolution and its consequences."
1,Shallow,"I am for evolution, but I find Dennett's arguments very weak. It is books like this that sustain creationists."
1,God's way of doing things: evolution,"Any idea that considers some aspect of ""first"" or ""ultimate"" cause is but part of mankind's endless search for meaning and order. For one, as my self, who has faith in an ineffable God whose order is transcendent, some ideas move mankind's journey in faith forward and some, like this book, do not."
1,Dennett thinks Darvin is dangerous,"Very interesting book. It so obvious that Dennet has a predisposition to preach evolution. Dennet's philosophical view is not naive but it is hypocritical, he knows that Darvin was ignorant of genetics. The Humanity is so lucky to have an ignorant on generics invent a theory that would be a beacon for genrations to come. I agree with Dennet when he says ""This book is largely about science but is not itself a work of sceince"". I wish that Dennett was able to point out what part of Darvin's theory is not proven beyond reasonable doubt (if we agree that beyond reasonable doubt is not proving a theory with another theory). Dennett's almost religious determination to accept and defend Darvin's evolution as whole is very interesting. Very good controversial book I enjoyed reading it. george."
1,Did Darwin really have an idea?,"All that I had to read was the title of this book to know that it isn`t worth my time. What idea did Darwin (Charles I presume) have? Evolution by means of natural selection? Ever read Patrick Matthew? Alfred Wallace? Herbert Spencer? Authors whos publications predate the ""Origin of the Speciese"" and include the idea of evolution by natural selection. Bow down before Darwin and his ALLMIGHTLY idea.(For those interested, try reading the 1ST edition of the Origin and see if you can pick out Darwin`s dangerous idea.)"
2,An Instinct for the Capillary,"If you want to know why academics are considered such boors, read this book. It is a textbook of minutia, pettiness, and strawmen. Just as professors often indulge themselves in class, at the students' expense, by attacking adversaries unfairly, Dennett wastes 500+ pages on petty disputes with real (and, I suspect) imagined enemies. Starting with an important premise, he runs it into the ground and fails to deliver any comprehensible summary of the broad significance of Darwin's ideas. Aspects that should have been mentioned in a paragraph are made into long, haranguing chapters. The disputes are so-o-o-o boring. Dennett may be a great guy and a brilliant mind; if so, he did himself a major disservice in writing this book. If there is any justice, he will perish by publishing.This book badly needed an editor. If it had one, it would have been 300 pages shorter. Save your reading time for something that will enrich your life, not this pedantric mess."
4,Practical,"I was impressed with Dennett's rational and logical arguments, that for the most part were undisputable. Unfortunately, he also does an excellent job of alienating those who would disagree through his sometimes sarcastic tone. In effect, I agree with previous commentators, saying that the audience who would most need to read this would be immediately turned off by the way Dennett presents his ideas. I would completely recommend a reading of this if you can concentrate on the books rational and logical value."
1,Dennett's dangerous idea?,"Daniel Dennett is a very confused fellow. In this volume, he argues that Darwinian natural selection behaves as though it were intelligently designing the living world we all know and love. And in other volumes (e.g. *The Intentional Stance*), he argues that we are justified in adopting the 'intentional stance' toward a system if, and to the extent that, we find this 'stance' fruitful in understanding its behavior. So what *is* his beef with people who adopt the 'intentional stance' toward evolution itself? If it *looks* and *acts* like a process of intelligent design, then doesn't his own philosophy argue that we should *treat* it as such? But, oddly, he wants to stick religious people into 'cultural zoos' and take away their children (that's what he says in this book). Why is that? And why *shouldn't* we regard someone who says such a thing as a 'vile little fascist'?"
1,Keep it short,"This world is ridiculous! This life is ridiculous! There are so many things in this world are pointless! People believe in god and doing good? Pointless. Making a child? Save your effects, you are only making another slave of evolution! And even better, by casting the energy, valuable energy that only available in this dark cold universe, life is simply meaningless!...I guess that's what I would look like if I read this book when I was 15.By creating our lives, the nature has made the most possible 'mistake', because we are able to choose our meaning of life, no? Or maybe we are glitches, like dogs, in wolves' point of views. A mistake of a mistaken system might be something else, the result of evolution don't necessarily make us carry the same original meaning (or meaningless). Thus whatever the point of view of the author, or if it is right or wrong, it doesn't matter anymore. What matters is what we are going to do with our glitches, or say, this gift of free will."
2,all the monkeys aren't in the zoo,"With this book Dennett has emerged as the most eloquent of the Science Nazis. His recommendation for placing Christians and other religious minded people in zoos (like other endangered species) is witty and bound to cause titters among the chattering classes, but his is really a blueprint and a call to arms - not a joke."
1,I totally agree...,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer in comparing Dennett to Tom Clancy (if not in the same way). Just as Clancy pumps out serial novels filled with drivel, Dennett gets rich off of writing trashy pseudo-biophilosophy books. I admit, he does have a persuasive writing style, but I have never seen a more gross mis-interpretation of evolution since my ultra-christian 9th grade English teacher. Read someone such as Gould instead."
3,A so-so book,"I am fascinated by the theory of evolution (I've read most of Richard Dawkins' books, and many of Steven Gould's), and by philosophy. So I assumed Dennett's book would be a great combination of both. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I'm not saying that this is a bad book - it certainly isn't. It's just that unlike other books like Dawkins' or Susan Blackmore's (for example), I didn't catch myself saying ""wow! this is a great insight!"" many times while reading the book. It has a few interesting ideas, but they are embedded in hundreds of pages of other text that doesn't really add new ideas, at least not for me. I also would not recommend this book as an introduction to natural selection and evoltution: try Richard Dawkins' ""The Selfish Gene"" instead."
3,too twisted,"This book may be a treasure chest for philosophers, as an introduction to evolutionary theory it is not well suited. Too often Dennett is brillantly beating dead horses and resolves philosophical problems rather than getting to a point understandable or relevant to the normal scientifically interested reader. If Dawkins says ""this is a surpassingly brillant book"" he is probably right, with an emphasis on ""surpassingly"" - for most readers Dennets reasoning is way over the top of the head."
3,Caveat,"I must play the devil's advocate here. While I pretty much agree with the previous reviews I have read here, my recommendation and approval comes with one caveat. For me, the book would have been much more enjoyable had Mr. Dennett not constantly reminded me of how well he thought of himself and how important and significant he thinks his own work is. Tedious might be an appropriate aphorism as well."
3,Dennett is to philosophy what Tom Clancy is to literature...,"Dennett is to serious philosophy what Tom Clancy is to serious literature: technical flash, tortured logic, dense prose and inexplicable mass market appeal. His Big Idea is that consciousness is an illusion, but to whom he never quite explains. Here he tries to drag Charles Darwin as an unwitting co-conspirator after the fact, but you will learn less about Darwin said than what Dennett thinks he should have said (hint: Darwin never uses the word 'algorithm'). Would have been better titled ""Dennett's Disingenuous Ideas.&quot"
5,review,it was great. came in a timely mannor and was in great condition when it arrived. had it not been for a friend who could not handle his alcohol and ended up puking his guts out over it i would be thoroughly enjoying this product. but alas it was not meant to be
3,Biochem,This book was good but I was under the impression that the book was the normal book not international. It was paperback with no color on the pages.
4,Works great in G4 Mac.,"Bought this to replace a broken ""Sweet Multiport"" kit I had in my Power Mac G4 MDD. Surprisingly, it worked great without having to install any drivers. Will likely not fit in a G4 QuickSilver (because the front optical bay door is tiny), but should fit in a G3 B&W or G4 Graphite if you take the optical or zip drive out. The advantage to the G4 MDD is it has a full size (5 1/4"") secondary optical bay, and installing it there worked fine. A bit snug when plugging things in, but good enough. Be careful when routing the internal cabling before you close the door on the G3/G4."
2,String broke in 2 weeks,"I'm new to cello, so not really sure what happened, but this string broke within two weeks of purchasing. Since I am a new student, I'm really only practicing ~30 min/day. Very disappointed that this string broke so quickly."
5,Excellent book,"Best tattoo book I've ever seen. Large, colorful pictures, detailed descriptions, and beautiful artwork. I had to drive all the way to Japantown in San Francisco to find the book because it's out of print or something, but it was worth the wait. Pick this up, you won't be disappointed..."
4,Get Educated!!,"Insightful book on perhaps one the richest forms of tattooing. Descriptive text, great quality images, a must have for anybody willing to learn about the history of japanese tattooing, and what it really means, especially with so much horrible tattoos walking around us today. COP IT."
3,"Very specific, one-style-only, old school, hard to view details","I was disappointed with this book.I'm a big fan of Japanese tattoo, but this book only shows Yakuza style tattoos, whole body, men only (there's only one woman tattoed in the whole book).The pictures are mostly shots of the whole body, so you cannot see the details of the tattoos clearly.There are only old school tattos, nothing from the more modern, contemporary Japanese style.I expected to see at least a few cool dragons, koi fish, cherry blossoms, colors, but you get more of the rough drawings, demons, ugly faces, and so on.If you're looking for something very specific on this theme, this book might be interesting. But if you want a broader view of Japanese tattoo, forget it."
2,Not very fun,"Normally, I'm a big fan of the Simpsons but this game really did no justice to the name. Aside from the snide remarks that the Simpsons crew throws out constantly (which in my opinion is the only entertaining bit to this game), the game is very repetitive and boring. The graphics were very choppy and sloppy. It was like time turned back, it was 1983 and I was playing Pac-Man on my Atari.It plays like Crazy Taxi, which too, was also a bad driving game. This is really not a game for the older gamers but kids will enjoy this very much because of it's simplicity. I hated it but maybe you'll like it. Have fun and Happy gaming!"
4,A Great Game!,"I love this game! In Road Rage, you have to pick up Simpsons characters and drop them off where they need to be. When you get a certain amount of money, you get a reward! You can either choose a vehicle or place as your reward. To get more money and time than usual, you have to get the passenger to their destination in a timely manner. Sometimes you get a bonus for dodging cars, or destroying stuff. I would definitely recommend this game to gamers who are fans of racing/strategy games."
2,Not enough to it,"The simpson games have always been fun to mess around with. But, as far as buying this game; there isn't enough to it the levels are short and the overall replay value of this game is weak. Dont buy this game, rent it on a rainy day. Im serious......"
2,CRAZY TAXI RIP OFF,"Its basically the Simpsons version of Crzy Taxi-Hardly different just a plain Rip off,They never used there own game engine just coppies.Buy it if you never plaid Crazy Taxi or even if you never got enough of it.NOT a classic just a Twin clone."
4,Itz A'iight,"OK, this game is really fun. You get to drop your Simpsons people off and then get paid. When you reach, a certain limit (300,000), you get another level or person/car. For more info, go to Crazy Taxi, its the same thing. The only bad thing, bad graphics. Its toatally not realistic at all you crash through trees, run people over and they tumble down the road like a newspaper and then get back up and start walking. But its fun, and its MAD CHEaP so buy it."
2,Dull and Repetitive,"I am a die hard Simpsons fan and it's really hard to write this review. The second I heard about this game, I thought it would be really cool and I wanted it. When I got it and played it for a while, I discovered that it was not fun at all. To unlock more cars and characters, you have to pick people up and drop them off at different destinations. This gets very dull and repetitive. The only other thing can do in this game is these ten missions that are mainly composed of collecting or destroying objects in a time limit with no reward. Oh yeah, there this Sunday Drive thing which is picking and dropping people off with no time limit. In fact, the only thing positive I can say about this game is that some of the voiceovers are funny."
2,Why do they keep making the Simpsons DRIVE?,This game is cool if you like the Simpsons (which I do) it won't matter if you like this game or not. EA uses the Simpons to sell another driving game that is kinda like crazy tazi in Springfield. This game is ok but not great.
2,dont buy this!,"If you compare this game to hit and run, well... you just cant. Do not paly this game after playing hit and run. THis game is so unrealistic that it is boring. You can play as a lot of different players and there are many different people to drive but it's just so repetitive. In the road rage all you do is drive people back and forth. They didn't even put time into making the level right. in mission mode you do different missions, but once again they are very repetitive. If your friend recommends this game (like mine) make sure to rent it before you buy it. Because if you do buy it you will probably just end up selling it here.rating out of ten: 2 1/2 - 3"
4,Definite multiplayer fun,"Road rage is a tremendous good time with friends. A clever twist on race car style play. The commentary of characters is on par with the series as is the hidden innuendo of locations and cars.My only complaint is that the big cars (Otto's bus, the Plow King) are just not competitive. They crash well but never stand a chance against Krusty's Clown Car or Wiggam's ride."
4,Awesome,"The game is very addicting.Funny phrases, especially Ralph with,""Take me home please, the leprachaun told me to burn things."" You will have so much fun with this game. The problem is it gets boring after a while. My advice is when you play shut it off for an hour or two and then play again. Matt Groening (Creator) did a great job!! I give it 4 1/2 stars."
4,Great Game,"This is a very excellent game, it deserves five stars, except for one minor detail, the game becomes too repetative. In order to get the $1 million you need to win the game you end up playing the same level over and over. But don't let that stop you from buying the game, it is still very fun with all of the characters, and Springfield landmarks. The game is still very fun even with the repetativeness, and the multiplayer is very very fun. I would highly recommend this game, and for twenty bucks how can you lose."
2,Not Good Enough,"I'm a huge Simpson's fan, I just expected it to be funny or creative. It's not. The environment doesn't have any in-jokes or obscure references, just basic places like Quick-E-Mart, Moe's, power-plant. You can't interact with the environment. The characters don't say anything funny.On the plus side, the game play and graphics are OK. It is a ripoff of Crazy Taxi.So, don't buy the game just because you're a Simpson's fan, you'll be bored with it immediately."
5,Simpsons surge far above Crazy Taxi,"The Simpsons: Road Rage is by far the best racing game on Playstation 2. Play as over 17 different characters including the Simpson family, Krusty, Moe, Apu, Barney, Professor Frink, Officier Wiggam, etc. Choose one of 6 courses including the Nuclear Power Plant and the Springfield Dam. Pick up over 30 characters and take them to one of 75 different locations. Non-stop fun.The object of this game is to collect enough money to buy back the transit system from evil Mr. Burns who intoxicated the passengers with nuclear waste. Money will allow you to unlock another driver or course, your choice. Plus with 10 different missions like running over baseball mascots or smashing mailboxes just keeps adding to the fun. You can also play with a friend to see who can get 5, 10, or 15 grand first.Extra features include safe rides which earns you bonus money and road rages where you can crash into the interactive scenary for even more money. This game has nothing to lose!"
3,Fun for awhile,"I enjoyed this game but after awhile it got old. I definately recommend it just to mess around, not to be taken seriously. The voices are good and it has decent graphics. This is a game to get to keep your kids entertained for hours."
2,Doh!,"THis game had so much potential, but the designers just didn't put any thought into it. For example, in the special tasks games, why not have a level where otto has to pick up kids at bus stops? instead, mindless crashing into barrels and picking up characters over and over and over again with nothing to keep you interested. it's barely worth a rental. I love the show but the game just doesn't do anything for me."
4,Luvd It,This game is so cool. My firend got it and then I playd it and it was soooo fun. We luv watching the show. The peopel that U can B look lik the real characters. Not lik in other games wer they look distorted and nothing lik the real charater.
3,Fun game,"This game is just an exact copyoff of Crazy Taxi, but in Springfield with Simpsons characters. So if you liked Crazy Taxi, and you're a Simpsons fan, you might like this game. But I don't recommend it if you already have Crazy Taxi."
3,"very fun, for a while","This game was a lot of fun when I first got it. The graphics are very nice and all the characters are in it. It is just like crazy taxi, so if you liked that you'd like this game. I just love driving up to bumble be man, and here him say,""Ay chiuaua"" just before I run him down. A big problem with this game is replay value. I can get very old very quickly because of the repetative gameplay. I would rent this a couple times, and if you still like it as muck as you first played it, then you should buy it."
4,A kids review.,The Simpson`s road rage is fun in many different ways. In one of the missions you have to hit 20 statues in 59 seconds while Mr. Burns is chasing. TIP. change to bumper camera to complete mission 10.
2,boring,the game is just like crazy taxi you drive and pick people up and the loading time is incredibly long and boring this should be aplaystation game not a ps2 game
4,The Simpsons Road Rage is fun for any teen,"This game has alot of highs and alot of downs but in over all its a great game. I'll rate this game by the sound, graphics and gameplay.Graphics- First I got to say that the graphics in this game are plain. Theres no edge to how the game looks but its good. For the graphics I would say 3.0/5.0 not perfect but good.Sound- The sound in road rage is great. They have many sayings for each character and they dont rapidly say each saying over and over. I would personaly say 4.8/5.0.Gameplay- Very good. Not as good as the sound but still good. You can do much and you really don't get to bord of road rage. I would say 4.0/5.0.In my opinion I would say that it would be worth it to buy this game. Its more then just a rent. To me I like this game better then crazy taxi. I think that if you're thinking of buying this game for a gift you should stick with this game."
3,Not as fun as I thought it would be...Too repetitive...,"I saw this game on sale and I snatched it up immediately. Gameplay was a somewhat difficult and repetitive. This game is sitting in my collection growing dust. Although, it helps to pass the time every once in a blue moon it is definately not the the most fun."
3,road rage is great but could be even better,"POSITIVES:Road rage is great fun. I have found myself playing hours and hours at a time! The game, no doubt about it, soars over more traditional and, shall we say, less chaotic racing games. The missions are fun too. It will surely stay as a favorite game for a long time. Then, there are theNEGATIVES:This game takes forever to load. In the missions, I find myself striving harder than ever to complete them, because if you fail, this is how it goes: Press RETRY > Wait about three minutes > Play another one and a half version, and then start again if you fail. Ditto with the actual game. I also find the Sunday Drive feature relatively pointless.Other than that, I love this game and will readily recommend it. Oh yeah, the Head 2 Head rocks!!!!!!!!*_-"
3,Gets boring,"The only fun levels are the second,first and the sixth.When you beat this game you don't unlock anything at all!!!!!"
5,under rated,"Dont believe for one second what the critics say about this game, because this game is great. Sure, it borrows heavily from crazy taxi. But with this game you get 6 cities, all just about as big as the 1 city in crazy taxi. You have about 20 characters that you unlock as you make money, and there is an actual plot. There are so many voice overs in this game, a voice for each person driving and the customer. The play control on it kind of [stinks], but the rest makes up for it. Sometimes the controls can get a little unresponsive too. But there are 10 minigames, which are all pretty easy to complete. But ive played this game more than i think any other game i own for the PS2... its very easy to catch on and hard to put it down. MOST DEFINATELY GET THIS GAME."
2,Repetitive,This game gets repetitive after awhile. All you can do in this game is drive around with different vehicles and characters.The recreation of Spring Field is nothing like the one in the TV show.
2,Not worth it,"i dont know why but i beat the game. i just finished it today. I worked on it forever getting one million bucks at about 10,000 bucks every run. every run took like 15 minutes with the loading time. What kept me going was the ending movie but it turned out to be a...30 second scene of one of burns' little insults he gives you after every run. IT ISNT WORTH BUYING. but, it would probably be worth renting. the things the characters say is really funny at first like homer saying ""get in, i've got candy!"" and molemen saying "" take me to the dentist, the pain helps me remember i'm alive!"" But, after 5 times, its not funny. no way do not buy it only rent. got it?!?"
2,Short Lifespan,"The novelty of this game wears off very quickly. At first it was fun to play as several of the Simpsons characters but when they started repeating their dialogue for the 50th time it became mighty tedious and tiresome.The gameplay is very simple. If GTA: Vice City is the Lego Technic of road rage games then Simpsons: Road Rage is, without a doubt the Lego Duplo. It is SOOO aimed at kids. No one over the age of 13 will be particularly impressed with this. It's just far to `safe'. The Simpsons TV show is full of satirical humor and intelligence but this game is just a cheap spin-off aimed at a much younger audience."
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,"This is one of those ""must rent"" games. Clever for a while and never really able to evoke an emotion. It only makes the user think, ""This is pretty interesting"".If you are not a big fan of the show you probably will not be as exicted to play this. Most of the main characters are available, they just have to be unlocked, which is achieved by accumulating points by picking up Springfield residents and dropping them off at particular locations.Each character drives a different vehicle that pertains to the Fox show. Marge drives a Canyonero. Grandpa drives a Shriner's Cart. Reverend Lovejoy drives a bible mobile. They each have several catch phrases, which seem to repeat after three or four games.The difficulty is very low and the boredom factor kicks in after 20 minutes or so. Plus, this game takes a long time to load into each segement.A very quality rent for the Simpsons fan. Think twice before you purchase."
3,Jaimie... where are you??,"I ordered this movie 'cus Jaimie Alexander was in it.Only problem is that she is barely in it.I love Jaimie and will watch anything she does, and although this movie was tolerable, I really missed her presence. Her all too brief appearences were at the beginning and end. So, as a Jaimie fan, I was disappointed with The Other Side. }:o(ps (02-16-13)- for those folks that my entry did not help because of lack of movie review... sorry! But, there are plenty of good reviews to read. I'm not a horror genre fan and my focus was as stated, I'm a Jaimie fan. As such, this was intended to help others that like all things Jaimie! Hope that clears it up for those reading the reviews. }:o)"
5,Surf music will never die,"If you love surf music, you have to have Dick Dale in your collection. One of beginning surf bands of southern California. Just a little fact for you, Dick Dale realy did surf ( Brian Wilson of Beach Boys never surfed). This is classic old D.D. surf sound, plus no one made there guitar sound like he did. If you didn't know, he played left handed. But he played with the strings upside down because they hadn't made left handed guitars back then."
5,Got scrapwood??,"I'm just like every other woodworker out there. I generate a lot of cutoff's from my box making, that are generally too small to make another box out of, but too nice to just throw in the wood stove. Doesn't take long and the ""scrap"" starts taking over the shop. When I first got this book, a year ago, I hoped it would help me use up some of that pile. It did. This book is has 18 ideas and designs, that Mr Pierce goes into great detail about. Design/layout, cutting/fitting, etc. I actually think there are more pictures and drawings than there is text. His tips on tool use and finishing are excellent. After making several of the projects in this book, I began to generate idea's of my own, so many in fact, I had to start writing them down. I think this was intentional on his part. The book gets ya goin and then your imagination kicks in. An excellent book, highly recommend to every ""scrap maker"" out there."
4,Conditioner ok,The conditioner is okay. I use it because it has been reported to help hair growth but I think Nioxin conditioner leaves my hair looking more full.
5,Excellent vocabulary builder,The pictures captivate my children and they love to search within for the oblects named at the exterior of each page. Can't recommend it highly enough.
4,Quotable!,My husband sends me a quote from this book daily and every one of them is inspiring. This author knows what he is talking about when it comes to the business world and it's a quick and easy read. My husband is not a big reader but really enjoys this book.
5,Dust Cover,This dust cover was for a Mongoose Bedlam and the fit fine and were up to specs. They were good.
4,Parleys island,Love the author it's my second book ....love the scenery and the characters .....makes you feel like you're there !
5,ALL her books are great!,"I have now read all but one of this authors books, and they are all fantastic. I wish there were more because I'm really going to miss them. I'll be watching for her next books."
2,IT GOES ON AND ON AND THEN SOME MORE,""" Pawleys Island "" started out with promise BUT, should have ended 75 pages sooner . I'm not going to spout why, nor go on and on except to say, this is one book that won't find a home on my shelves but will instead be donated to some prison where they have lots of time to waste ."
3,No zippee do dah,"Dottie, what was the purpose in the ending? Can't we readers use our imaginations just a little? I think we figured out Huey way before the last chapter. Plantation and Sullivan's Island spoiled me! I'm not giving up on you - try again!"
5,She's Done It Again!,"Once again Dorothea Benton Frank has penned a marvelous story of the Lowcountry. Other reviewers hint at the plot and name the characters so I'll come right to the point and say this is one of Frank's best yet. Hey, you don't have to tell me about these people. I KNOW THEM. Page after page, I smelled the salt air, felt the sea breezes and tasted that sweet tea. This is what a novel should do--take you there and put you in the middle of it. Wonderful story. I was very sorry when I finished the book, I may have to go read it again."
4,Fun Summer Read,"I enjoyed Pawley's Island. It was a perfect breezy novel without too much complication. I enjoy the atmosphere in Doreothea Frank's novels. The Low Country Books, for me, are what the doctor ordered for summer reading. This book has fun characters, a bit of melodrama, bad guys, a beautiful landscape, imaginative settings, witty prose, good story, a strong heroine, and I enjoyed it.I read two of Dorthea's books this summer and while I thought the first one had a better and stronger plot, I did like the light, amusing story of Pawley's Island. I like the town and the beach and it's history. The bad guys always are dealt with justly in Dorthea's books and the stories are just plain fun. I look forward to reading more books in the Low Country Series. If you haven't read one yet, and you enjoy light, southern style stories that are heart warming and festive then you'll love this."
3,a SLOWcountry tale is a more appropriate title,"Compared to her other books, this one started out slow. I really love her a writer. It did catch me later on, about halfway through, and I loved the ending!!"
3,Not her best,"I found myself skimming pages in this book to get it over with. I did like the ending and enjoyed Rebecca and her kids, but i could have done without Huey, Abigail and Julian. Anxious to read the next DBF offering!"
3,"A Pleasant Read, but no fireworks here","This was my first book of Ms. Frank and although I did enjoy it I was suprised by the lack of depth in the story. I found it to be very predictable and at times just silly and not believable. I was expecting a rich story full of Southern tradition. I'm from the South and I was suprised also by the rich lifestyles of these people. When I think of 'low country' people, I don't think of Jaguars and caviar. I was expecting more down to earth people with much more depth of story in their lives. I mean, this is the south, right? And we southerners take family and loyalty seriously. I have a few more of Ms. Bentons books to read and I'm keeping an open mind. I'll give her another try and hope I'm not disappointed."
1,PAWLEYS ISLAND - audio book,The reader is awful - she smacks her lips and does not inflect and should smoke another cigerette. I could not get past the first 3 tracks and I tried!!!!!!
3,Ridiculous but fun,"The story is totally ridiculous, but as the cover says, it's a good beach read and many parts are very heartwarming."
2,Disappointing read,"I have enjoyed all of Frank's novels but I feel she is trying to write too fast. In other words, quality goes down with each successive book. Dorothea, take more time and thought with the next one, please. I am a loyal reader."
1,Let the pro's do it!,"This review refers to the audio CD version:I am a voracious listener when it comes to romantic and fantasy literature on audio. It doesn't happen to me very often that I will stop a book at the beginning and put it away, but that's what happened with this one. The author is the reader, and Brilliance should have talked her out of it. It is obvious that she does not have the talent for acting the voices as a trained voice actor would do. This makes the reading painful, at least to me. She didn't do any characterizations that help the listener distinguish the characters in the story, and her voice inflection was very flat. I was almost finished with the first CD and still couldn't figure out who was who and what was going on. I gave up at that point and will donate the book to the local library with hopes that someone else will have more staying power than I do. Authors should definitely let the professionals read their books and stick to writing them!"
1,Loved Sullivans Island! Hated this!!,"This book was terrible. The book ended 50 pages early and just drug on and on. The court case wasn't plausable, having tackled the Charleston County Court myself, the judges never slam the bad ex, and make the other look good. They just don't do that. Plus Dorothea is friends with Robert Rosen and I can't imagine that he would have told her her scenerio was likely to happen in Chas County Court. Instead of this book just read Sullivans Island and stop there. She's not putting in the effort anymore."
3,brought back good memorys,ut was lots of fun watching this!!its been years since ive seen superdave in action & he rocks!!kids will just love this guy!!!
5,Front counter monitor,We use the dvd/vcr combo at our front counter playing ads for the products we carry. It works great and saves space too.
1,Worse TV I ever purchased,"I bought a Toshiba MW20F52 20"" combo TV with VCR and Dvd.. this was the worse TV that I have I have ever bought. Hard to operate, color the worse, remote a piece of junk.. wouldn't do anything right... didn't have it 24 hrs. before I returned it back to the store where I purchased it...Purchased a Sylvania 20"" Flat Tube combo with VCR and DVD Model 6720FDG. I am very pleased with it and I have only had it a few hrs. easy to operate and the color is great the best TV so far that I have bought in years for a small combo TV... If looking for a Combo worth checking out this one...you won't be disappointed... Cheryl Phoenix AZ...."
2,Convenient but repairing one component is a pain,"I have had this model for 2 years now and the DVD player suddenly stopped working. I have to send the whole thing to get it repaired. It is just not worth it!! When it worked, it wasn't bad. Since the DVD and VCR are all inbuilt, I needed only one cable to hook this set up in our bedroom (no clutter!). However, keep in mind that even if one of the component breaks, you have to send the whole thing back!!"
3,Nice LITTLE TV dvd/vcr combo,If you only need a small screen but want to save space and also have a dvd/vcr player this is a great and inexpensive tv. The picture is very good and once you get used to the small screen it's a nice little tv.
5,Very nice product,This is a very nice product. No problems yet and it's been over 2 months.Compared to the other TV?VCR/DVD product (this one's DVD door fell off two weeks into having it - both VCR & DVD functions died with 2 years) I bought for the same money 2 years ago this seems a much sturdier one.
1,I received broken one...,"As the title, I received broken one. Therefore, I could never use this TV. I want to say to the seller of this TV that sell normal TVs!!"
1,Too small,"I thought that the product description had dimension that is 21""x ... and therefore it should be large enough. It came in a tiny little box. This is not worth $16. It's like a $2-3 item, like a Hotwheel car. I was very disappointed."
2,Too much money for this tiny pack of ramen noodles,I made the mistake of paying top dollar for this tiny packet because I couldn't find tomato flavored ramen noodles in the market. Never again.
2,Costs way too much,"These ramen noodles cost about three for two dollars at every asian grocery I've been to. They are absolutely awesome, but this price is just highway robbery! These are basically one-serving packs of ramen noodles, for heaven's sake..."
2,Don't mess with buying this!Only For Track 4.,You Should Mine as well buy her self titled debut album because All Of The Songs off of this are on it except the (Burn Unit) and (All Star) and The Only Cool One Is (All Star).1.Don't Mess With My Man Featuring Brian and Brandon Casey and Mystikal (Michael Cox Remix)-9/10-It is a great song but I just Don't get why he swears.On Original cd.2.Don't Mess With My Man Featuring Brian and Brandon Casey and Mystikal (Burn Unit Remix)-1/10-Holy S*** This Remix Sucks The Background Music Don't Match The Words it's way off tune.3.Don't Mess With My Man Featuring Brian and Brandon Casey (Album Version)-9/10-It has the same beat as the Michael Cox Remix minus Mystikal.On Original cd.4.Don't Mess With The Radio Featuring Petey Pablo-10/10-This song is the best of Nivea.I Love this song soooo much.Hot Beat.
5,Perfect fit,Was thoroughly please with this purchase. Ordered this for my 2011 Chevy Silverado and it fit perfectly on the hump of the front floorboard. Didn't even have to try and secure as its very stable even with full 32 ounce drinks in the cup holders. The cup holders adjust to fit most size cups and are easily adjustable. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for extra storage and cup holders for their silverado pickup truck.
5,Great Console!,"I own a 1964 GMC Pickup Truck and I needed some type of unit that I could carry my drink mug, cell phone, pen, notepad, etc. I am most-pleased with this Hopkins Black Console. It fits in well with my interior carpet, and is just what I needed!"
1,"Bulky, does not mount easily","This is an unusually bulky console and is simply too big to fit in our Oldsmobile. It would be fine for a full-size pickup truck.Also, the only way to attach it to the transmission hump is to drill into the car body and use sheet metal screws. It does not fit the curvature of the hump, nor does it have weights to stabilize it."
3,It's ok..,"I got this put between the middle seats in my new Grand Caravan. It works ok without any screws, and is easy to pick up if I use the 3rd row seat. The cup size adjustments work, but are not easy to do with one hand. I thought about using some black Velcro under the unit to better secure it to the carpet if I ever wanted one for the front."
3,Ok,"It is a fair one, the only problem is that it moves sometimes from its position. I try not to drive aggressively so it doesn't move."
4,Fun place to get ideas on how the creative mind works!,This is a fun place to get practical ideas on how the creative mind works.It is easy reading and filled with interesting quotes and anecdotes. The best part for me was that the writers share different tips on how they get around to solve creative problems.More than formal thechniques you will find straightforward advice (like you would find from a friend or co-worker). I found it useful.
3,Probably better for kids and teens.,"It's a good book for sure but the concepts are fairly basic. Reminds me a lot of another good creativity book ""How To Think Like Leonardo da Vinci""."
2,not what I thought,"These are great except that many of them require a huge amount of background knowledge of numeracy that my adults don't have yet. I end up spending an entire math lesson on just one of the warm ups to fill in what's missing instead of just using them as a quick 5 minute warm-up.They would be good for a higher level class, but not so great for an intermediate adult basic ed."
3,"An interesting CD, maybe not exactly my taste.","The opening cut on this CD is really great, blending saxophones and drum and bass some neat little latin percussion. A really fresh and interesting song, but the next 3 were progressively not as interesting. Maybe I just need to listen to this a lot more, but from what I've heard so far this is probably not going to be getting lots of play. Amon Tobin's other recordings sound extremely interesting, and much more promising than this one (IMO), too bad I took a chance on this one first."
3,Good starter,"I got this for 4 year old grandson.He is too young to enjoy this one in full.But he can manage to put on the track, couple them, and play like toy.Set up the track was easy. It just click them together.It is realistic which he really liked. It is more durable then some of other model trains.Overall, good starter for youngster want more realistic than toy trains."
3,"Well written, fleshed out characters, preachy ending","This is a beautifully written book. Two girls--Delia, headstrong and confident, Anna, a total people-pleaser who is tossed about by what she thinks everyone else is thinking of her--meet in a little country town and gradually learn to understand each other through their mutual love of Anna's grandfather, the town's organist. I would have given this book four or more stars but the ending is abrupt and preachy, and left me feeling queasy."
3,Three Sister Islands,I enjoy Nora Roberts work but for me this fell a little short. I give it three stars but I don't think it's one of her best work. It's not quite as exciting or intriguing and some of her others. I would still recommend this trilogy but not my favorite.
4,Three Sister Trilogy on CD,"I am a fan of this trilogy, and I am a re-reader of favorites. I first read these books years ago when they first came out, then had them on cassette, and now CD. A bit extreme to keep re-buying, but on a long car ride or during a day of cooking in the kitchen I enjoy the familiar tales. The reading and acting itself is pleasant enough to be relaxing yet energetic enough to keep me engaged. I tend to rotate through a library of books on CD, and I come back to this trilogy often. I recommend it to Nora Roberts fans or anyone who likes this genre of witchy romance."
2,nah,"same ole, same ole. Nora's older stuff was much more enjoyable, but then again, maybe it was just fresh material then and now they all seem to sound the same."
2,Price Increase,I already own the books and love them. I had planned to get the ebook version so I could read them anywhere (I had already purchased the Key Trilogy and the In The Garden Trilogy over the summer.) Imagine my surprise to see a hike in prices.How can you justify an increase of over 40%?
2,SMH,"I love this series and wished to purchase it for the kindle. However, since this costs 23.99 and the cost of purchasing each of these books at 7.99= 23.97. Call me dumb, but I think I'll purchase them separately. A penny saved is a penny earned."
3,Just okay....,"Three Sisters Island trilogy was very predictable. It passed the time while driving, but there was no suspense after the first book."
3,Okay story line but too much swearing for me.,"Although the story line was not bad, I had a difficult time getting passed the language. The characters seemed to be unable to have any kind of conversation without swearig. I can take some colorful language, but it was as if their vocabulary was limited in getting their point across. It was just too much for me. This was my first experience reading a Nora Roberts' book, and I can honestly say I'm not interestd in reading another."
5,stories about Wicca have always interested me,This is the first of her stories I have read that involved the teaching of wicca--it was very well done and as a student of the white craft I truely enjoyed it
4,Nora Roberts Thress Sisters Island Tryilogy,"Nora Roberts is always a great read. The Three Sisters Island Trilogy has the 3 stages of romance, which I like to read. But this set was not my favorite of her trilogys. It didn't seem to have the same fire in the details that some of the other trilogies have had."
4,I've seen better,I've seen better cars. I drove one around the other day in the parking lot and it's pretty slow... it doesn't handle that well either....
1,How could you buy this?,"You people make me sick. Get a real rc car. You could get one that is a hundred times better than that one, some even cost less, ready to run. The reason that the car is hard to control at high speeds, spins out, and loses control sometimes is because the people that made the body forgot to cut out the bottom section in the back, therefore building up a large mass of air under the body, making the rear end of the car ""feel very light"". If you are considering buying this car, slap yourself in the face, and get an rc car from a hobby shop."
5,Dodge Viper GTS/R,This car is the coolist eletric r/c car of its time. The speed is the best i have seen for an r/c car for this price.
2,dont buy this go for the real stuff,"this car is good for young kids like under 10 but if you are a teen or adult for a little more cash you can go so much faster.this car is nice but its not really upgradable.if you put in a better motor it will fry the electronics.if you want a real r/c car like a pro one, get a traxxas 4-tec, they sell for about $189 and they go 25mph out of the box and you can upgrade them.you can find them at a local hobby shop or online. nikko is good for kids but its not so good for teens."
3,great for awhile,Great car for an older kid. I am 11 and i liked this car. It was not very fast.1 problem is it is dangerous i bought this car a month ago and i have already returned it. It picked up a different radio signal and burnt my arm. This to is not durable it hit the curb and goit really diged up. Also the stearing broke!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was a fun car while it lasted . I am saving up for a faster better car.
3,-Cool-,This car is fast. But not the fastest. I have a Bandit Buggy and it is way faster. This car only goes 20 mph. This car goes 26+mph. And even better the bandit was on sale price. So it was a great deal. So think before you buy this car.
5,so fast,...when I got this toy I was amazed at the speed of this toy. The viper is incredible and very very fun.This toy is worth the money
3,well.......,"This car is great for those who dont like to customize the cars. If you like to do that then you should get something for a little more money, but they are much faster, about 45-60mph top speed. There is one thing I do suggest you but at a hobby shop is a 15 minute charger, these are really cool and you dont have to wait."
2,the worst toy in the world,"hi.If you want this car and you are 10 years old and younger and you're begging your parents for this toy,DON'T please.get a different toy beacause when I got it out of the box I was excited,probable you are too.I carged it.I started driving it and,it drove great but after a while the battery only lasts 5-10 minutes.So DON'T get it please.Get a another toy PLEASE.DATE-6-22-03."
2,dont last lons,my cousin bought this rc for hia brother but he hated it because it only lasted for a couple of min
5,This radio controlled viper is Great,For all the people who are saying this car is to much money you are wrong. this car i definetly worth the money you will pay. for the person who wrote the steering spins out easily is wrong. there is a knob on the controller the adjusts for straight driving. i even put in a new motor and now the car is even better. if you scrath it you can buy new bodies to it and replace tires even. not many r/c's do that. so this car is definetly woth the money!!!
5,Umbertina,"Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditonas described, packaged well.Would use again."
4,Umbertina exposes the heart of Italian American women,"I found the book to be an accurate and stirring portrayal of what it is like to be an Italian -American woman. In the second generation I still recognize the attitudes, feelings and traditions of my ancestors in this book as well as the struggle to affirm our talents as women. I highly recommend it."
2,Buy the newer version instead of this one.,"This book is a work in progress for their subsequent solutions manual. This particular edition has only attempted less than a fifth of the problem set. I do not see how that is supposed to help. They have done a better job in their next edition, ISBN: 0-321-17319-8. For whatever reason the newer book ISBN does not show up on leading online book sellers such as Amazon. You may have to find it in your campus bookstore or the publisher's website."
4,"Good detail and worth getting, but note...","I was pleasantly surprised at the level of detail of the provided solutions. As an accompaniment to the text (third edition of ""Fundamentals of Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems""), it is well worth the cost of purchasing.I would have rated it 5 stars, but, unfortunately, it only considers (approx.) 1 fifth of the exercises in the text, mostly every second or third odd-numbered exercise, but the occasional even-numbered one.Note that a latter edition of the text is available, but I've yet to come across a Solutions Manual for it."
3,"Nothing Special, But Not Terrible","This is what is says it is--a highlight video. Considering the price (over 20 bucks) I was surprised the production value wasn't a little better. Most of the highlights are taken from ground level, and in most cases they don't use the shots from those who televised games. The Pitt game and Sugar Bowl are a little better than some of the others. If you really want a keepsake of the season, this is pretty good--esp. if you like to see some behind the scenes stuff. But if not, pass on it."
3,Good Short Read,"I enjoyed this short novella, the characters were not well developed but the storyline was good.This was only the story by Jacqueline Diamond not all three books. Rick and Rebecca are best friends, Becca is getting married and Rick is her ""Man of Honor"" she has alway done the right thing and picked a safe man, Becca and Rick have been friends since college, he's a former NFL football star and she's an accountant. She decides that she won't make the mistake her mother did because her father left when she was young and her mom had to work to hard to make her way in life.Becca and her groom never argue, Rick and Becca argue all the time. Two hous before the wedding, she finds out there is a problem, she lets he mom know there won't be a wedding and leaves, the only place she can think to go is to the Inn she booked for their honeymoon, Rick figures out where she is and follows her there. Great story, the character of the groom was not well developed."
5,"Tanto sentimiento hecho bolero, desde América","Violeta canto boleros,y cuanta canción latinamericana existe, su hijo aprendió de ella. Ahora es el turno de mostrarlo a todos, su canto, su sueños, sus emociones, su vida a todos ...¿Quién no ama hasta el cansancio?¿Quién no lo da todo por el sentimiento? ¿Quién no se entrega entero por quien uno ama?"
4,"Colorful, Solid Pull-Toy","This frog is beautiful on the shelf. I pull it for my daughter and she likes to carry the frog around under her arm. It's solid wood, very sturdy. A great old-fashioned toy.I only wish it had more of a hopping action. It bounces slighty as it rolls, and it's mouth opens a tiny bit, but it would be nice if it was more noticeable."
1,Wore them once.....,"wore them once and a hole formed at the tip of my left big toe. I have short toe nails, so that wasn't a problem. Very thin. In all honesty, this is really just a dress sock. A cheap dress sock. Don't believe me? Just buy it. The packaging looks like it was done it a back room where they just slapped gi sock stickers on it."
1,Very disappointed,"I liked the bike well enough for about the first year. I was unable to use it for about three months and when I tried to start riding it again, it had gone ""dead."" I changed the batteries. Dead. It's frustrating to have a piece of equipment that just stops working after such a short period of time. As the other reviewer points out, it would be nioe to plug in--maybe it would work that way (maybe not)."
4,Interesting. You'll read it in two days.,"Two Belgian friends travel to Las Vegas for a fornight. But their minds never leave their home-town (Ghent), their families and their friends. Their troubles, repressed up to that date, surfaces...The author (and the translator) have a sound command of the language and a vast vocabulary."
4,Makes Pilates work complete,"I'm a Stott Pilates instructor, and I love this DVD (and the other weight-loss products from Stott). The concept is similar to Leslie Sansone's home walking--very simple aerobics designed to burn calories, rather than challenge coordination too much. Some people will find them too simple, but I really like the atmosphere--the instructors are down-to-earth and grown up, and they bring just the right attention to form and alignment.Pilates appeals to many people, and if you're someone who's attracted to Pilates because you're not a gym bunny, you'll probably love this no-nonsense approach. It's very achievable and it works."
3,Plan on using your own music.,This DVD has a music only option - don't bother. The music is different from usual walks and that's OK. But ONE piece of music is used for the entire walk! The workout feels incredibly long with the same music over and over and over. The moves are simple enough to use an MP3 player throughout.
1,OFF DESIGN ALBUM,"VERY COMMON MUSIC LACKING ANY IDENTITY OR GROUND BREAKING FACTORS ,WITH LOTS OF DRAMS 'N' BASS,KICK DRUMS AND JUNGLE BEATS RUNNING EFFORTLESSLY TO COMBINE UNHARMONIZED MELODIES.IT'S OK FOR THIS GENRE LOVERS, LIKE FATBOY SLIM,BUT THIS ONE IS FAR BEYOND WHAT U EXPECT.I RATHER CALL THE TITLE OF THIS ALBUM ""MISTAKES IN SOUND SESIGN""."
2,THANK YOU OZZY!! YOU SAVED THIS RECORDING!!,"I bought this recording because of Ozzy appearance on ""If I close my eyes forever"" this is a great song!! however Lita Ford is a mediocre singer and an acceptable guitar player what else I can say!, If you find the above song in any other compilation buy it because the rest of the music on this CD is just GARBAGE!"
2,Not very insightful,"I think this book would be good for someone who has never been exposed to any marketing concepts but it is not very original and was mostly disappointing to me. There were defintely not any ""a-ha"" moments as I read through this book, just the standard encouragements that most marketing books would offer you. It is just a very basic book!"
1,unhelpful,"It's not clear that the author actually has experience in the mental health field. Her suggestion to make friends with the office manager, offer to pitch in and help are very unrealistic for anyone trying to make a living."
5,The O'Jays' status as Soul balladeers of the highest order remains intact.,"As a man who does NOT like most post-1988 R&B, I can honestly say that this 1997-released CD from The O'Jays is definitely worth getting and enjoying. As purveyors of romantic Soul balladry, The O'Jays are still among the very best and this CD proves that this legendary group still has plenty to offer. This is a CD that will definitely please any fan of real and authentic Soul singing. Enjoy!"
4,I love John Frusciante,"I love John Frusciante, and he's my favorite member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This album is great, although it has a strong melencholy theme. The best song on here is definitely Past Recedes, and the others are also good. If you love John Frusciante you must buy this album, you won't be disappointed."
5,One word. WOW.,Curtains is possibly the most creative out of the 6 album series. I loved this album from the first note. John's lyrics and vocals are beautiful. My ranking of the 6 albums in the series:1. DC EP2. Inside of emptiness3. Curtains4. The Will to Death5. Ataxia / Automatic Writing6. A Sphere in the heart of silenceListen to this album with your eyes closed or in the dark. You'll never feel more peaceful in your life.
5,"John Frusciante, U are the man, EXCELLENT","All of the six albums are great, i noticed many people put them in order, but i think i would be doing an injustice since i have owned some longer, and therefore may be baised, but i think all are great, not one dissapoints.I've listened to this over and over, and if i had to pick out stand out tracks, i would say #1)Past Recedes, #9)Hope, and the last one #11) Leap Your Bar.The only dissapointing thing in all of this IS that this is the final of the series. I hope we see much more!!!John, if you ever read this, thanks for the great music!!"
1,Does not buy if you have Vonage VoIP,"I bought this to eliminate clutter from my desk and improve the quality of service for my VoIP. This router is not supported by Vonage. You have to use their router. Hopefully Vonage will change their policy, since monopolizing is illegal anyway. If other phone companies allow you to use your own phone with their services, why shouldn't Vonage allow you to use own router to use with their services?"
3,Terrific insight into nautical practice of the late 18th century,"If you can get past Cooper's verbose and stilted prose, this is a great love letter to the skilled mariners who manned the decks during the Golden Age of Sail. Probably a full quarter of the book is devoted to depicting the moment-by-moment changes in rigging and tactics for both fight and flight in fickle weather. And that stands alone as the sole basis on which I recommend this book.The tale is a fairly formulaic and romantic account of what amounts to just over a fortnight in the life of a gentleman pirate who commands a noble if motley crew, and the dashing young officer of the British Navy who is assigned to apprehend him in the Americas. Predictably, the protagonist finds more to admire than despise in his quarry, and the generosity & civility of the Red Rover is shown to exceed that of many commisioned sailors in service to the Crown."
4,Good Game,"This game was worth the wait and cost. The graphics are awesome. The options make the game capable of almost any match. The controls are very good. The Story Mode is highly repetitive, making the replay value not very good. The commentary is the most awful ever created. Play it for the graphics and options."
3,Smack Down is an OK Game,"WWF Smackdown: Just Bring It has great gameplay and grapics. But, graphics are not everything. Although this game has over 70 matches and over 30 WWF superstars, the ""Story Mode"" is very, very poor. I know as a wrestling fan, this is probably the most important mode in a wrestling game. You pick a wrestler and then you try to go out and win a title. After you win a title, you have to go out and defend it. Not in this game. In past Smackdown games for PlayStation 1 has an enhanced story mode. I am dwelling on this because it's the funnest thing to do in wrestling. Although the story mode is poor, who would'nt want over 70 matches. This is a very fun game though."
1,Don't buy this unless you just like individual matches,"I must say I am very disappointed in this game. For the PS2 they should have carried out their promises to the fans. Their storyline section is horrible. You have like 4 matches tops depending on what you pick as a storyline choices-Previous Smackdown games have a season mode where you can continuously play as a character as you unlock levels. Here you have to finish multiple storylines in order to unlock wrestlers and movie segments. Lame if you ask me. The Create a PPV is gone as well which is sad. I loved making those. You can't interfere during a wrestlers entrance. The only thing you have is improved graphics...Thats nice but for the PS2 there should be more. If you want to get a WWF game, buy Smackdown 2 for Playstation and enjoy !!!"
5,Playstation 2 and WWF's GREATEST EVER!!,"Getting Smackdown was the #1 choice I've made all year. Even though JBI takes up 4,173 on the memory card it still bypasses all other games. Not even the Xbox's Raw can beat this. The only bad part is that they delayed it so long and no RVD but Fred Durst?! What is up with that? Smackdown Just Bring It does sp that the Playstation is and will be the best system a second year around. The story mode is awseome and the ring entrances are incredible, THQ brings it."
1,...more like LET-DOWN!,"THQ REALLY dropped the ball on this one. This game is nowhere NEAR as good as any of the WWF games they did for N64, and that's a less powerful system! The commentary is ATROCIOUS! The words are pieced together and often recorded at different octaves. And while the new intros are quite cool, I wish they would've put less time into those and more time into getting the actual GAMEPLAY to run smoother. The characters often seem to jump around the screen at random.For those who simply MUST play this cuz it's a WWF game, I urge you to RENT IT FIRST! You will thank me for saving you the $50!"
5,Awesome game,"The jbi game is awesome. It has wonderful graphics and has all the popular wrestlers. You can hold up to nine, count that, nine people in the ring at a time. There are over 65 matches. The create a superstar mode is awesome, but the best part is the season mode. Its great. They even have roaming mode. Buy it, its worth the money."
5,WWE SMACKDOWN JUST BRING IT,sdjbi iis one of the best wrestling games out you can knock out the ref who looks like earl hebner there are over 65 match types including hiac tlc ladder table hardcore cage and many more there are many superstars my estimate is around 40 including the rock rikishi stone cold undertaker and many more i have had this game since November the story mode is ok but it needs to be longer if you are a wrestling fan buy it if you are not rent it first
1,WWF Blows,"This is the worst game that I have played this year! The game play is terrible. Sound is fair. They still can't make a realistic wrestling game, but wrestling is staged already right?"
4,just bring it,this game is great ilove it the graphics are very realisstic the story mode isnt that long but in hardcore matches you can fight in the street and you can fight as tajiri and more caw parts you can fight in the crowd but sometimes when you are fighting against a com player when the com does a move on you when you get up you might be facing the ref instead of the com but every thing else is great it's a must buy.
2,this games really [stinks],"the graphics in the game is oh...ok. the games play is could off been better,the story mode is the just bad don't waste you money and buy this ,i just hope someone, anybody would by the crap from me."
2,Lacking,"THQ managed to make Trish Stratus, one of the hottest female wrestlers out there, look like a strange colorful slow moving blob. What happened?! Most of the wrestlers look funky...I think it's because the game designers spent most of their time focusing on the wrestlers' bodies and movements that they forgot about the heads (the bodies don't even look that great). It makes for a rather disjointed experience, it's like wrestling with a bunch of pokerfaces, their expressions are always the same, no matter if they're standing or getting smacked in the head with a chair. Maybe the next version will be better. I had more fun with WCW Nitro, even though it's 3 years old--the game had crowd noise, better rippin' music, and some fun secret characters like a ghost and a skeleton wrestling old school macho man savage."
2,Multiplayer Fun Only!,I own the first two smackdown games on PS1 and was eagerly awaiting this one. What a let down. The so called immersive story line is short and almost nonexsistent. The gameplay graphics would have been great as a first gen game. The only good thing to be said about it is the entrances and control in the ring. Leave this one as a rental only game with a few friends. THQ should have known better.
2,Can you smell....the disappointment????,I was pyched to see this come out....man what a let down. It's just a slicked up version of the PS1 game.
3,Smackdown 3 JBI Doesn't quite bring it,"Remember the rush you got the first time you played the original smackdown game for ps1? You thought man, this game truly brings the emotion of the WWF into your hands! THQ backed this up with smackdown 2 the next year. I waited for a two years to finally get a sweet wrestling game on the PS2, and what did I get? Smackdown 2.5!!!!! Smackdown 3 for ps2 is just like number 2 for playstation, the only difference is the graphics are a bit better and much smoother but they arent really that good! the moves arent as good and they barely added any matches. Not to mention the fact they left out such wrestlers a s RVD. Also Not to mention the god awful commentary that Tazz and Michael Cole provide, they sound like robots.Before you get this mediocre game i suggest you rent it first. I have played it only like 15 times and it has sat on my shelf since december."
5,This is a really fun game,"This game is great its lots of fun and the the graphics are excellent.Theres great matches from tlc,ladder matches,table matches and the ledgendry hell in a cell. So i advise you to get this game."
4,This game is hard!,"I think this game is definitely worth buying. But there is no difficulty setting and its very hard to beat your opponent. But a hard game is a good game. I just love the backstage areas. The locker rooms look just like they do in real life. The boiler room and the lobby are large areas you can do anything in. Also, In the parking lot and the front entrance you can fight while cars pass by. Unfortunatley, if they hit you, it just moves you out the way. You can also drive the forklift, but all you can do in it is push your opponent around. But I still love the wide, extremely detailed areas. And if you look closely, you will see a certain item in remembrance of the September 11th terrorist attacks. The one thing that really bothers me in this game is the amount of time it takes for your player to stand up after being hit. After only a simple body slam it took my player (Kurt Angle) one minute to get up! But I still highly recommend this game."
5,Spot on fantasic,"For those who have read the previews of Smackdown: Just bring it, ought to know that it plays very similar to the first 2 in the series. And updated roster to reflect the current situations over the past year (minus the wcw.ecw alliance). The best create a wrestler ever seen of any wrestling game. So create your own Alliance members. 45 wrestlers with 4 secret wrestlers and much improved match types like the 3 stages of hell match. I recommend buying it the day it comes out."
2,What happened with this game??,"I was really excited when I got this game, but really dissapointed when I turned it on. First they should have just left that annoying commentary out. Its horrible belive me.The Story Mode isnt very good either, I dunno I really dont like this game.Graphics are alright, but I think Ill wait for Wrestlemania on GameCube !"
5,The Best WWF game ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"WWF Smackdown! Just Bring It!, is da hottest wrestling game ever. I don't care what nobody says. Dis game has over 40 some wrestlers and over 80 matches to choose from. Very wide selection!!!!!!! The best thing bout this game is da gameplay, if your The Rock for example he does his own taunts such as the peoples eyebrow, and he moves and hits opponetslik himself."
3,ONLY 17 TOTAL DIFFERENT MATCHES.,"Smack down just bring it has 17 different matches. but they times it by including 2nd, 3rd, and 4th player.SMACKDOWN WRESTLER LOOK e-regular with blocky FacesSMACK WON't ALLOW YOU TO FIGHT IN THE CROWD OR BLEED Like RAW ISWARRAW IS WAR WILL BE THE BEST."
2,Pretty Bad.,"This game is pretty bad. First of all,the controls are just way to complicated for me. And the comantary is terrible. The story mode is one of the worst iv'e seen. Just dont waste your money on it , period. If you have a nintendo 64 , stick with wcw Black/White."
1,worst wrestling game ever,just got the game today and im going to return it after i write this the story mode is horrible the fighting is medioker dont bother even renting it it a waste of time would have given it 0 starsbut wasnt allowed to
5,Game of the year? YES!!,When I first bought Smackdown! I thought that it would be the best wrestling game ever - and I was right. The entrances are perfectly put together - Jericho's is amazing. The finishing moves are even better. Overall this is easily the best wrestling game avaliable.
2,"Marginal, Story Line Weak","I have to say I expected a lot more from this title. Comparing it to the past 2 for the PSone it appears that THQ still doesn't have a working model for the story or career mode. I was able to unlock 96% of the secrets in 1 1/2 hours. The grapics are good and the load times are quick (saving is agonizing). Create a wrestler mode is as deep as ever, moves included. However I just can't get over how weak the Story mode is, 5 matches max and your story is over. Then you have to start over with the same drawn out FMV scenario and limited choices. You will play yourself out of this in a few hours. Then really what are you left with? Exhibition matches? No thanks THQ."
2,weiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiird,"fruity,fruity,fruity.i just have to show a list pros ;choose from stars like jeff hardy ,stonecold,and the rock.ok graphics. cons;you basically have to kill yourself to get out of the hell in a cell.the specials are jacked up.you cant even here the commentaries.thousands more. i played it with my cousin.if you like wwe,get here comes the pain,raw2,or legends of wrestling 2 because it is better and has a better season mode with storylines."
4,It was good for its time,"this game really isnt as good as i have read what people say about it. first of all this game takes up more memory on a card then i have ever seen before you take up ALMOST HALF of a band new memory card its crazy @_@ and the so called season mode IN THIS GAME is very limited and BASIC the wreslting its self seems alittle smuggy (not a real word) but its a good jump for a wrestling game at that time the commentary by Tazz and Michael Cole is extremly BAD its kinna weird alot of messing up in the whole game they might as well just not put it in there,but on the good side i do love this game when i first got it i was amazed and couldnt stop playing it the roster is pretty awesome and the unlockables too the matches are also another thing that i loved about this game. this game is just pasted its prime thats all and at this point new and better games have came out since this but they all gotta start somewhere right?-Todd The Rodd"
3,Still a bit fun,I went back and played this game not too long ago. I was shocked to see that I was actually enjoying myself. Using Jeff Hardy is still as fun as I remember it to be. The only bad thing about this game is the BRUTAL commentary by Michael Cole and Tazz.
3,"In The Words Of Adam Sessler, ""I Give It A 3...Out Of 5""","I mean, aside from the laughable commentary (IE ""Chris Benoit, I Wanna See Him Do An, Crippler Crossface"":-) and grossly understocked roster (when compared to SHUT YOUR MOUTH), it's pretty much like Smackdown, Part 2.5 and Shut Your Mouth's Part III in that case, and Here Comes The Pain's...you get my point right?"
3,Room for improvement,"A pretty decent game all said and done, just some very annoying aspects to it. There could have been more wrestlers, even though you can create virtually any wrestler you've ever seen through the excellent create-a-player mode. you can also create your own taunts which is interesting if somewhat confusing at first. lots of different matches and the ability to have 9 characters of screen at once. the controls could be a little sharper and switching between opponents is very difficult if there are many people in the area. also, the difficulty levels in the story mode should be adjustable and not just random. also, the stories are very repetitive, and there isnt very much depth to each story. i was hoping for a more interactive back stage area where your actions would determine what matches you participated in and who your allies/enemies were. this is somewhat true of the game but to the extent i thought it was going to be. rent it before buying."
2,Same Old Smackdown Crud,"I liked Smackdown 1 & 2, not a lot, but enough to make Smackdown 3 feel like a tired retread. Instead of the heinous load times in Story Mode from Pt. 2, Smackdown 3 replaces them with a virtually non-existant Story Mode. Three matches, you win the belt, game over. What is THAT? The bazillions of match variations add little. Tag matches are frustrating. It's too hard to tag out, and then you can mercilously beat up your opponents outside of the ring... and they WON'T FIGHT BACK! Weapons/tables/ladders are all worthless. Cage matches make it difficult to see your wrestler. The controls are overly simplistic, and the graphics are improved, but not up to what you'd consider GOOD for PS2. A waste of money and time unless you really, REALLY need a wrestling game. Hopefully a good one will come out some day."
2,Great story mode?,"Uh...where do I begin? The story mode is the worst idea I've ever seen on a video game. What is the point in having a story mode where it lasts about 15 minutes. Stick with SD:2 if you like seasons to simuate real life WWF. Other than that, though, the graphics ae unbelievable. The entrances will blow your mind, and the gameplay is really good. There's nothing much more to say about the game other than (sorry THQ) rent the game rather than waste your money on it!"
5,Finally Smackdown has come back to the Playstation!,"This game looks flawless. They have all of the best talent the WWF has to offer in the game, The Undertaker, RVD, Stone Cold, and the Rock to name a few. A huge amount of hidden secrets, a very much improved story mode, 78 styles of matches(including TLC, Table, 6 man Hell in a Cell, 3 stages of Hell, Hardcore and many others), over 15 backstage areas, and many PPV events and arenas to chose from. (...) It looks and will be a lot better that Raw is War for the X-Box, that game only has 30 wrestlers, 6 modes of play, no ladder matches, cage, or tlc, and hase nothing like story mode or anything like that. (...)To sum it up, its simply ELECTRIFYING!"
3,Smackdown! Just Bring it!,So here is the follow up to Smackdown 2! No your role! Just bring it is exclusive to the ps2 and is the reason why many people bought the playstation2.The graphics are much better and the wrestlers look much more life like than in both of the other smackdowns. There are also new match types like the sumbmission match and free stages of Hell which give you a variety of matches to choose from.There is a good reason why I have only rated it with three stars though and that is simply because of the story mode which is cut short because it ends once you have one a belt and defended it once which takes about three or four matches to do. I myself do not own a ps2 but with the lack of length on the story mode do not wish to purchase this game with it!
2,what a messed up game,"Yea at the time it had the story line right. And yea the game has a high replay value. But this game is HARD even on easy this game is hard. The story mode is long and repeditive. I mean dont get me wrong i am a hard core WWf fan but this game is shame full. Stone cold does not look like stone cold. The entrances are correct but in no way long enough. And the ""commentary is laughable not at times but thought the hoel game."
2,Just Bring What?,"If you like graphics, this is the game for you. However, if you like a point... keep looking. THQ has kept us waiting forever on a wrestling game and this is their answer? Geez! I want to play it because it looks so good, but there is no reason since there is no career mode. Just exhibition matches! Ok, there is a story mode, but it's hardly worth mentioning. Three matches and you're a heavyweight champion. Among other minor irritations I wont get into, my biggest gripe is the game play. Imagine Mortal Combat with only exhibition games. Boring! Hopefully ""Legends of Wrestling"" will give me a reason to play."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"A huge step back from the last Smackdown game. Story mode is horrible. Once you win a title (which you can pretty much do in 3 matches) you can't save and continue any longer. Graphics are just about the same. Faces look a little more detailed but the bodies look less realistic. Music, entrances & commentary are improved but the game play is worse. When facing the computer they'll waste time doing 3 taunts after every move instead of trying to follow up with another move so there's no real challenges. Most times when you try and throw someone into something outside the ring they just stop short for no reason. And the game locks up a lot. Overall tons of flaws."
4,the best wrestling game could still be better,"This is the best wrestling game, but, it could still be better.the story mode repeats itself on new games....why not use voice instead of text? out of the box it locked up on an exhibition matches entrance music...how annoying is that? the ladder match is very cool just like the 1st smackdown, hell in a cell had an obstructed view, the fighting in the crowd looks good till you see there paper thin, and I personally feel there shold be more wrestlers to chhoose from. it has improved ...but not to the lengths I had expected. final thought....just like always nintendo will probably end up with the better game."
4,good game,this game is good but needs some improvement.the royal rumble still has four people in the ring at the same time.you can do the same thing a million times in the story mode without it changing and it doesn't have is many superstars as there were at that time but it is still a good game.
4,Good,"Seeing it's been awhile since Shut Your Mouth came out, I will go ahead and give my view on this game. It's a OK game, but lacks the following:1.) Good Season Mode. (Few matches then its over....)2.) Needed better Arenas.3.) The newer wrestlers at that time when it came out should have been on there, seeing they delayed it for a good while.On the other hand it has its good sides:1.) Better graphics than SD 1 & 2.2.) Cool entrances, not just a full screen then 10 seconds of your wrestler coming out.3.) Cool MatchesAnd thats about it.Peace"
4,Good game but not up to date with wwf!,"This wwf game is good. However this game could of been improved with adding the new superstars to the game. Such as Booker T, Kevin Nash. Hulk Hogan,the list can go on. However the gameplay of this game is very good. The reversals make the game a bit challenging. Otherwise the game would be too easy to play. However the storymode is good and the graphics of the game is also good. However u may want to wait to buy smackdown 4! 'shut your mouth'. This game will surely have all the new superstars and will also be a more improved game. Because overall i think the smackdown just bring it was rushed and alot of improvments could of been made to make this a very good game. peace!"
1,what the rock is cooking smells bad,"This game is a waste of plastic. I did not like the gameplay. If you like wasting your life, this game is for you. The graphics were highly pixelated. The animation is very choppy. The sounds reminded me of atari.I like this game anyway. It is the best WWF game made this year for PS2."
3,"Useful, but not sure is worth the hefty pricetag","Since there is no Editorial Review-here's mine. This book lists info on all US (1)Wal-Marts, (2)Sam's Clubs, (3)Camping Worlds, and (4)Flying J truckstops. l was also hoping for some lesser-known ""free overnight parking"" spots, but ONLY those businesses are listed. I could have researched those well-known businesses on the internet myself (but now I won't have to ;-). I will use it since I paid for it and the info it contains is useful, but not sure if it was worth the pricetag for me. My own fault, I should have done better research on the title."
1,Creepy and horrific,"When this arrived at our house, we were shocked and horrified. It is rock hard and looks like a taxidermied family pet. This is no ""plush"" cuddly toy, Sheesh - this is going to be a nightmare to return..."
5,lie size dog,I have bought a few of these ridiculously large dogs for my husband's kid. He loves them. He likes this one the best because it looks pretty close to our actual dog. They are the same size. Our pet was momentarily fooled by the stuffed dog. I would buy any of the Melissa & Douug animals. They are high quality.
5,"Great stuffed dog - so real, even the dogs were confused!","All of the dogs in our family were confused by this toy - is it a ""real"" dog? They all had to sniff and try to play with it. It was very comical. Incidentally, the ""kid"" loved it too!"
4,Life-like Toy,"This plush Black Lab is strikingly like our real life Black Lab and that has made for some hilarious confusion. However, the seam around the ear opened up after just one day. It was an easy fix but the fact that it gave so easily suggests that this toy needs more delicate handling than your average plush toy, even at its very large size!"
4,Fake Dog,"Using for dog training purposes. Odd looking and sewing very weird, but it's not being used as a toy for a child so it serves it purpose"
1,Title is very misleading,DO NOT buy this book based on the title - it has little to do with skew and how to take advantage of it. Do buy it if you want a review of mathematical volatility models.
3,Practitioners Beware,I've ordered dozens of books from Amazon over the years and this is the 1st one I'm returning. The title is nonsense -- it should read Stochastic Volatility Models for Phds.
1,The Worst TV Ever Purchased,"The ToshibaMD14F52 arrived defective. Some channels would not function properly - ghost images and snow on screen. We have direct connect cable with 5 other TVs that work perfectly. Toshiba customer service was horrible to deal with; they were evasive,would not listen to my explanations but insisted on telling me to try what I had already tried to make the TV work. They also told me to call my cable company for help. Finally, after talking to several different unhelpful and unfriendly Toshiba people, I was referred to a TV repair agent for Toshiba that turned out to be unsavory, dishonest, given to lying and refusing to demonstrate he had fixed the TV as he claimed. He refused to plug it in to show it worked. Well, as I suspected, when I got home and tried the TV, he had left the TV as non-functional as it was when he received it, but insisted it was fixed. He told me to buy an external TV antenna and not use my cable TV! I will never buy another Toshiba TV again."
5,a classic writing guide,"This classic guide to the art of writing is as thought-provoking now as it must have been upon publication in 1924. In erudite prose, Edith Wharton describes the general aspects of fiction, going far beyond the surface to touch deep veins often unseen by casual readers. Using examples from the classics, she analyzes the methods of telling a short story and constructing a novel. She contrasts novels of character, such as Emma, with novels of situation, such as The Scarlet Letter, and discusses novels that weld the two types. The last chapter of the book analyzes the works of the great French author, Marcel Proust.By studying this book and the works it refers to, one may perhaps develop the ability, demonstrated by Proust, ""to reveal, by a single allusion, a word, an image, those depths of soul beyond the soul's own guessing."""
5,First Rate Tips from One of America's Best Novelists,"Edith Wharton was one of America's greatest authors, and her succinct overview of the key elements for lasting and serious fiction is first-rate. I have read others on this topic, including EM Forster, Ray Bradbury, and Stephen King, but Wharton's tips still endure for anyone trying to write or read a serious or enduring novel or short story. Some of her key points: dialogue should serve the narrative and be used sparingly; the subject of a great novel should provide some insight on our moral experience; originality is not based upon a new technique or style so much as it rests on an original vision; and even minor characters should serve some purpose. Of course many novelists break these rules and succeed very well, but Wharton's insights are superb for any aspiring novelist or serious reader of fiction."
5,Book was in brand new condition.,"The book was in mint condition, jacket showed almost no wear, no pages creased, no marks on any page. Beautiful in shape as well as content."
5,TOO MUCH FUNK!!!!!!,"DO NOT listen to Herbie Hancock's live ""Flood"" album in one sitting-particularly the closing 20 minute ""Hang Up Your Hang Up's"" where a tight groove from his ""Manchild"" albumis drawn out into a heavy.funky freak-out where the drums,horns and even Herbie's key's are each given a wild,dintinct solo space within an extended groove.Another surprize is the theclavinet-free ""Actuall Proof"" where the grand piano replacesthe electronic instruments used on the studio version.The opening ""Maiden Voyage"" offers a similar lead as the Headhunterscome firmly to grips with a smooth post-bop style.Amazingly every number from Hancock's funk period are given slightly moreacoustic,very different musical treatments and that quality is what makes ""Flood"" a true funk ovedrload!"
4,Is Tommy a manic?,"I'M NOT QUITE SURE, BUT I FEAR THAT MR CARAMAGNO MIGHT BE MANIC IN HIS OWN WAY. HIS CONCLUSIONS ARE ALL WRONG, YET SINCE HE WATCHES SEINFELD, I GIVE HIM 4 1/2 STARS."
5,BEST QUALITY,I ordered this product to replace the ones I had on my truck for over 15 years. These were BETTER than the ones I had.This product is made of good qulity and design. The company is very easy to deal with.
1,Does not stand up to curious hands,It ripped the first time we used it!We have twins and they immediately were drawn to the butterflies and ladybugs that were attached by velcro.As soon as they got them off they started to pick at the WHITE velcro on the pool itself and within minutes the pool had a huge hold in it!We attempted to use the patch kit that came with it but to no avail.We then tried to use superglue and it wouldn't even stick....it's in the garbage now after 20 minutes of use
5,Interesting,"I thought this was an interesting book. It helps greatly that the author got Paul McCartney's cooperation, and so there are a lot of quotes of Paul's that you won't find anywhere else. I thought I knew everything there was to know about the Beatles, but did not know, until this book, that there was talk of them making Joe Orton's play LOOT into a film. Of course, when the Beatles saw that the characters were gay, they said no. As Paul says, ""We didn't have anything against it being a gay film, but we were four very butch guys, and it just didn't make sense. Mick Jagger's a bit more that way, so someone like him would be more suited to it."" Incidentally, (as Paul said in his authorized biography MANY YEARS FROM NOW), Paul was one of the backers of LOOT when it was a play. LOOT was a hit in England, but flopped when it played on Broadway....A good book for any Beatles fan."
4,Very nice!,"Great summer dance track, with catchy hooks, great lyrics and the voice of multi-talented Christina Milian! The remixes of the song are just as strong, with the Flores and Full Intention dub as standouts on the CD. Hot song from a brilliant artist."
4,I checked out the 1960 vers from the library and it's nice,The book smells like 40 year old books do. Inside are a lot of nuances that the non-novice could appreciate. Granvile was a market master for a time and then fell from glory (FYI) like most do. He still has some good insight and the pros might appreciate that here.
5,Great Local Recipes,"I originally had this book and used it so much, that I wore it out. I ordered this one from Amazon as a replacement.Glad they had it in stock."
3,cutie pie guys,"all the album info you will need- song---1- stars on the sidewalk, 2- i can tell, 3- silver ring, 4- love is...... a holiday, 5- little star, 6- one night worse, 7- that's all....., 8- 0ne less angel, 9- yesterday..., 10- eyes of blue, 11- true love....., 12- morning blue, 13- nasty jack. recorded in vancover, canada. band mates- Rev. rick royale, ed maxwell, crash gordon, joel darlen. girlies on cover should have shown more skin, to make up for the ultra cheap packaging. it is a wonder i ever bought this cd, what was i thinking, thinking. maybe rhino could reissue this one- save the good music from oblivion."
4,Beginning of the end,"This is the last cd that Clint Black released that I can call country. There are a few signs of the things to come here, but you can let them slide by considering the quality of the songs. Almost all of these songs have pure country sounds. For some reason he changed his style to pure pop from stone country. Does he think we like that? Hmm. Get this and his the 2 previous releases and start praying for him to come to his senses."
3,OK Clint CD,"I have Clint Black's first five CD's, and I think he's a great country singer - one of the best of his generation. However, for some reason, this is my least favorite. Overall, it sounds pretty good, but there really aren't any songs that stand out. It's a bit boring and too many of the songs are indistinguishable from each other. If you're a big Clint Black fan, then you'll probably like this CD fine. Otehrwise, you'd be better off with his Greatest Hits or debut CD."
5,Two Great Tales,"I have read several of Eliade's books on religion, and I was surprised that he wrote fiction. Both stories are great, and they play upon themes covered in his scholarly works, e.g., sacred time and space. His academic works can be difficult to fully understand, the fiction helps to clarify and give new dimensions to his scholarly themes.If you are not familiar with his other works--that is not a problem (and perhaps a positive) because you will not be deflected from the quality of the fiction itself (which is superb). If you like a pre WWII fantastic/fantasy style, you will find Two Tales to be a fast and enjoyable read."
4,A good qualitative research textbook,"Qualitative research is a discipline that has become increasingly important in the past few decades. In research and academia, quantitative research is often emphasized more than qualitative, and therefore it is crucial to have good textbooks that focus on aspects of qualitative research such as in-depth interviews and focus groups. I bought this textbook since it was required for a qualitative research course I took in grad school. Overall I felt this was a good textbook."
5,"""Bus 9 To Paradise"" Will Enlighten Your Outlook On Life!","Leo Buscaglia has a unique way of relating life experiences to every day trials and accomplishments in all of his books. Bus 9 To Paradise decribes various happenings within his life that can be related to your own. He describes the emotions of living through descriptive, and sometimes humorous, stories about love, family, food, death, and friendship. There is not one chapter within Bus 9 To Paradise that I didn't feel the same emotions of the author at numerous times throughout my life. I have recommended this book to many friends and family members, all of whom were grateful for the insight it offers! Bus 9 To Paradise is a book that should be ""standard"" on every bookshelf across the nation."
3,Offers Insight,"As a Christian I always read books by authors from other religions with caution, in this case a Buddhist. With that qualifying statement given as a disclaimer, I'd say he has some insightful observations to make in this book. He quotes Aristotle as saying ""Dignity does not consist in possessing honors, but in deserving them."" He goes on to point out that we need the human touch. From there he observes that in many cases we only relate to people based on the function they provide. An example is a person selling shoes. We don't get to know the real person. That individual is exchangeable with anyone else who would sell us similar products. His discussion doesn't stay in the negative mode, however. In a subsequent chapter he describes how change is inevitable and that as our minds grow we do not ever revert back to our old selves. He clearly reminds his readers ""we are all teachers and we are all students."" We continually change and are influencing other people all our lives."
2,"Lots of fluff, little research","THis book incorrectly focuses on the FBI as the capturers of Ames and leaves out the mole hunting CIA team's chase of Ames. While they did mess up and take years to identify the problem, the CIA team caught Ames. THis book is also way short on providing insight into Ames motives, tactics and techniques. A MUCH better book on the subject is ""confessions of a spy"" by Pete Early. Earley is the only journalist that was able to interview Ames and his well researched book provides the story in Ames own words as well as interviews with his russian accomplices."
3,Solid rock and roll,"The review machine grabbed ahold of me on this one and perhaps set my expectations too high. Named dropped were, The Rolling Stones,The Vines and other ""rock"" groups of merit. Giving this album a spin i did hear the Vines vibe certainly but the Stonsy elements were not there at all.It is and ok rock record but perhaps not as good as i would've hoped. If you can score it on the cheaper side, i've give it a try.."
1,Awful performance of a masterpiece,"This is a terrible interpretation of a great ballet. If I had known how poor it was, I would never have purchased it.The choreographer was trying to make it hip and modern. Towards the beginning he has Daphnis fall to the floor and you can hear laughter from the audience. Later on, a dancer whizzes through a scene on a skateboard!! If you love this ballet as I do, do NOT buy this travesty of a ballet."
2,Inadequate!,"Many of the columns were interesting . . . painting a picture of a vast right-ring conspiracy that Hillary Clinton first brought to the public discourse. But it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete, without any interest either as themselves or as a theme. Does anyone care about Texas state politics in 1989, or Phil Gramm's problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate? Someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete .. except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book. Just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read."
2,Bright and funny writer hamstrung by her prejudices,Many years ago I enjoyed reading Ivins' columns but unforunately her brand of independent liberalism has turned into just another mainstream media voice parroting the Democrats. Her personal hatred of George Bush has become distracting and embarrasing. Strangely enough she reminds me of Rush Limbaugh. When he began doing political commentary on the radio Limbaugh was an independent with a conservative streak and was comfortable attacking Republicans. Similarly Ivins was originally an independent with a liberal streak who was comfortable attacking Democrats. Now Limbaugh is as firmly ensconced in the Republican camp as Ivins is in the Democratic camp.What a shame.
4,Molly follows Bushwacked with a broader attack....,"I really enjoyed the book. Molly goes after many of famous men over the past 30 years. Beyond the witty critiques on many presidents among others, her message to all to get more involved in politics and current events is important and inspiring. Perhaps more relevant than the critique of those men and the effects of their policies on us today is the continuation of ""Bushwacking"". Her perspective on Bush since ""Bushwacked"" is dead on and further evidence of the folly of his policies.She gives us, yet again, another book that proves more sensible and human than a host of other anti-bush books have. Her wit and good sense is best brought out in audio form. Her lack of mean-spirited style makes one the most approachable books for bush supporters looking for opposing points of view."
1,Liberalism Under the Guise of Ghandi,"I found this book rehashed a lot of her old books which I used to highly recommend to everyone. She kept using the term ""democracy"". We are a republic, as anyone who recites the Pledge of Allegiance knows. She is anti-gun, using the term ""gun violence"" and says the gun manufacturers are in it only for the money. We used guns to extricate/defend ourselves from the British, and would probably still be under their control if we had used what, bows and arrows safe enough for you? Also used guns to ""win the west"". The problem is not guns but the psyche of those who use them in a bad way. The countries with gun control have the highest rate of violence - England, Australia. She sheds tears for the abortion clinic worker who has to wear a bullet-proof vest but sheds none for the unborn. Yet she says we don't take good enough care of our children in America. She can't have it both ways, baby!!"
5,America is in need of a spiritual healing,"I have not read the book, but I am familiar with Marianne's writings. I can safely assume that this book is worth a 5 bacause of preious readings and the remarks she made on the Ophrah show on Wed. I thank God for people like this author,who is not ashamed of the Gospel and who's able to speak openly and directly about her faith to America. She's so right that we cannot fight evil with evil. Where there is no light there is darkness and where there is darkness there is evil. We as christian must stay on our knees and faces praying that America will wont go back to being normal. God word has told us in time of old, that if we would seek his face, turn from our wicked ways,and from sin then and only then will he hear from heaven and heal our land, and this land is truly in need of a spirtual healing."
2,not for me,"If you have a Christian background (I don't), then this might be a good book for you. Personally, I find Christian thought regressive, oppressive and fault-finding rather than a true celebration of life on Earth. So I did not enjoy this book. I didn't finish it, in fact. But I do know the Course in Miracles works for a lot of people, mostly coming from a Christian understanding, so if that's where you are coming from and you want some inspiration, this might be good for you. If you are more into the Eastern philosophies or a more shamanic approach to spirituality, you won't like this much."
5,Lichtenberg is the queen of character-driven drama,"I first read this novel in high school, and it left quite an impression. The world of Sime/Gen is split into two groups. The dominant Simes who must kill and drain the energy fields of Gens to survive, and Gens, who are bred like cattle. Both Races are humanoid, except Simes have tentacle like appendages which come from their forearms when they are 'hungry.'Rimon Farris is a son of a Gen breeder, a man who breeds and 'harvests's Gens to sell on the Sime market. When Rimon's girlfriend Kadi matures and develops Gen characteristics, Rimon will do anything to save her from the auction block.This is an excellent series, sure to delight fans of science fiction and character-driven drama. The Sime/Gen conflict is interesting and creates believable tension throughout. Don't miss this one!"
3,easy to tear up .,thought this toy would have been made for dogs. my 30pound dog chewed this toy withing minutes. I understand thats what dogs do but a day or two more would have been worth my money.
5,"Great ""Quirky"" Love Story","Erica James is one of my favorite British authors and this book, in particular, ""Love and Devotion"" is at the top of my list of favorite romances. I guess it cannot be characterized as ""hot"" but if you are moved by books with characters on the quirky side who are facing all kinds of ""life"" problems and unexpectedly find real love and romance when they are definitely not looking for it, you will love this book."
3,Predictable but enjoyable,"This is about Harriet Swift and what happens to her life after her sister & brother-in-law are killed in a car accident and she takes custody of her young niece and nephew. There are a whole lot of other interconnections going on, as well as how the parents and other friends cope with the deaths and it is a very interesting study in reactions to grief and change, as well as the way we rebuild our lives and accept what fate brings to us. The ending is predictable (maybe I just read too much of this stuff) and the stops on the journey to the end are also predictable but it is well written enough that I forgave it that and just went along for the ride."
1,Nice looking but ineffective,"I got these for my sliding glass doors as a security device. It looks very well machined and shiny, but it doesn't keep people from opening the doors.The way it works is that the lever has a wedge shaped inner surface that pushes a metal slug into the U-shaped gap inside the device. It's supposed to press the slug into the sliding rail of the door to keep the device (and hence the door) from moving. Unfortunately, the lever doesn't lock in place, and the metal inner surfaces are not very good at gripping the metal track of my sliding doors, so all you have to do is repeatedly push the door against the lock and it will slide the lock down the rail and allow the door to open while the lock is still locked."
2,Doesn't work on my sliding glass doors.,"I thought this lock would work for my patio doors. Turns out, it didn't. I think it fits specific types of patio doors and not mine. This little gadget shouldn't be tricky, but I had my brother, my best friend, and my neighbor all try to see how it would work, but none could figure it out."
5,Amazing,"I started reading this book 4 days ago. I had to force myself to put it down to get some sleep. This book opened my eyes to the club. I knew the club was started by Veterens that wanted the brotherhood as well as buddies to ride with but, the club is much more. The one thing this book really did was make me want to ride my bike that much more. To ride with a group of guys with the same outlook on life as I have would be great. To all who should read this, don't believe everything the media has said about the HAMC over the years. Sonny lays it out, to the best of his knowledge everything that happened from the early days to the present (well when the book was writen). I recommend this book to anyone and everyone."
3,A Decent Read,"My first read on any type of MC. I figured why not start with the HA's Sonny Barger the Legend of all MC's.It was an easy read. It had me flipping pages constantly but I was expecting more action on the next page.Dont get me wrong. There's definitely great stories on fights, parties and drugs but I guess it wasn't as much as I was expecting.This book is great on learning how the club formed and how they value themselves as Hells Angeles."
2,Alright Read,"This book was a good read and didn't take long to do. I have read better written books, but this is a good read all the same. I would be the used version."
3,Hell's Angel,"Good read if you are a fan of the outlaw biker life style. No holds barred by Sonny Barger and his ""Kiss my Ass"" attitude toward the 99% of society that he wants no part of. It is easy to see how outlaw bikers contribute to the job security of cops."
4,Nice Read,"I found this to be a nice read.It seems to be a fair account of his life with a little bit of embellishment.It doesn't really give you any since of the daily life of a biker leader just hits the highlights. Some of his accounts of things are not as history or other witnesses have said them to be, such as when the Monguls confronted them in Sturgis, but still a good read"
4,PURE AMERICANA,"I found this bio very good and a fun, quick read. Barger doesn't mince words and just tells it like it is. there are no excuses for questionable behavior, nor is said behavior romanticized. I saw Barger on The History Channel's Hell's Angels special and read this book thinking of his gravely voice. It really adds to it. It does make you want to hit the road to anywhere."
1,An old man who has selective memory,"""Sometimes you have to fight to be free"". Bless you Sonny, but you know the real truth and you have left all except the most innocent facts out of this book. The Hells Angels are a horror and a growing one at that."
3,An interesting read,"Bottom line up front, this book is well worth reading. The writing style is neither peotic nor amateurish, but it is blunt. He is biased, but makes no efforts to hide it. He has strong opinions, and is not afraid to voice them. In other words, reading the book is like sitting in a bar listening to Sonny Barger tell you about his life over a few beers. It is a refreshing perspective.I recommend reading Hunter S. Thompson's book about the Hell's Angels for a different perspective of some of the events and the lifestyle of the club members. What struck me most about Sonny Barger was his focus on the management of the club organization. With some polishing and the addition of teaching tools, his experiences would make for an interesting study in management."
1,Booze (Make that SNOOZE) Fest,"Save your money folks. I'll read the book to you: ""We're a bunch of cowards, we beat some guy up, we took dope, we beat another guy up, the cops are always hassling us, we beat another guy up..."" You get the picture. Sonny is borderline illiterate and that goes for his ""Ghost writers"" who basically wrote down what he said verbatim. He repeats himself ad nauseum, often within the span of two paragraphs. It's like being stuck next to some old booze hound in a bar that you can't get away from. ..."
1,Save your money!,"Sonny Barger admits that he does not like Harleys so much, but he rides them because that is the image of the club. He would rather ride a Honda or a BMW. Other than that, not much of what he writes about makes any sense. Why is a senior citizen still bragging about the ravages of a misspent youth, which is still going on? Why does he want to brag about how much time he has spent in jail? Why do we want to hear about his dysfunctional family, etc.? As an appendix, this book includes his rap sheet which runs for thirty years!"
3,Disjointed,The stories were goood but they weren't well-written. But it was funny how all the time they were in jail during a trial how misinformed the law was and how they kept trying to fabricate these conspiracies and could never do it.
4,Good book ..,I really enjoyed this book. The only reason I'm even bothering to post this review is to let you know that the Kindle Edition DOES NOT contain the photos from the book.Amazon really need to add this to the product description instead of letting us find out and ask for a refund.
5,Worth Reading,I read this book several years ago and got the urge to read it again. Even the secondtime around I found it hard to put down. It is interesting to hear another side to the HAMC than the media hype we have been fed for years.
2,Ghost writers terrible,Not well written. Under served the man in my opinion. Story jumped all over the place. Someone else should biography the man.
1,Worst Book Ever Written!,I couldn't even finish it. I kept waiting for some interesting content but it was the same old same old over and over again.
4,Sonny is another psychopath but the book isn't bad,"Out of the biker books I've read so far, this one kept me the most interested. Sonny's stories are pretty good but they are clearly his versions of the stories and he is always innocent. The Stones, His Ex-Wife Dying, none of it was his fault, it was always someone else. Oh well, a decent book in any case."
3,It was alright,"I believe the story line of the book kept me interested. When you read Bill Queen's book, you are spoiled in how the story is told and it seems this book was written by a elementary student. I think it gives good insight into OMC's if thats what you're looking for, just don't expect a great structure to it."
2,Shallow,"If you knew little about the HA before reading this book, you'll not know much more by the time you are done. Mr. Barger doesn't want to tell much or there isn't much to tell. Book is poorly organized and regularly jumps around 30 year spans of time without any connection. Mr. Barger is clearly a legend in his own mind. Basically a book about a bunch of kids who never grew up and never accomplished anything. Don't repeat my mistake by buying the book believing they were anything more than that."
2,Fascinating but deeply flawed book,"This is an extremely interesting book. However, be aware that this man's philosophy is that the one constant in the universe is man's inhumanity to man. What he calls freedom is his need to indulge this view of the world.The Hells Angels' desperate need for the fellowship of like-minded people follows from the deep feelings of loneliness and fear that they are unable to confront in this veritable hell of their own creation. Their desperate quest for freedom follows from the fact that they have none: in the hell of their own making it is impossible to act and think as an individual. They cling pathetically to each other for support, prepared to make absurd sacrifices for the club.Barger's book is fascinating because it is the product of a powerful and uncensored mind. It is flawed because he is a man who is utterly unable to see himself clearly or feel even his own misery. He needs, but knows he does not deserve, our sympathy."
2,What about all the crime?,"Barger's book isnt bad but theres some glaring omissions. In ""Wayword Angel"" one of Bargers closest friends tells about Sonny burying bodies in his back yard. Thats not in Sonny's book. There are some decent parts but dont kid yourself that its 100% honest either"
4,Sonny is the real deal,Love him or hate him this guy was a great outlaw biker. Surprisingly good writing but not for the timid.
4,His Own Words,Sonny Barger tells his own story in his own words. I learned more about this Hell's Angel than I ever expected to know. It's interesting and carries you along with his biker adventures describing the history of this infamous motorcycle club. I enjoyed the book and gave one to a friend.
3,Old dog,"Sonny Barger grows old and feels the need to tell the world his story in a succinct read. Short, sweet and to the point. Unfortunately disconnected story lines, obscure chapter endings, fireside tales all tell one story. Sonny Barger attempts to hold order in the midst of chaos. Media attention -- Hollywood fascination all helped keep the Barger's organization afloat, but the chief was surfing the tidal wave, probably sensed it, but didn't care -- because he had so little invested. The angles were a part of him, but if it collapsed... it wouldn't take a chunk of his flesh.It has interesting parts, some of the people he talks about were real characters and some still are. I read it over several days. It was just okay."
1,stupid senile delinquant !!!!,"if you think that raping girls, selling adultered drugs (very, very) to addicts and others idiots things like that are ""cool"" then you will love this book... This bad bad bad guy only dream to drive a Honda or a BMW...what a stupid outlaw!Yes even in France we have this kind of idiots, but they don't write...Oufff!Ji Air la grenouille (froggie&proud; to be..)"
4,This Man's Life is Amazing,"In rebuttal of the other ""review"" on here from Fall River MA, I'd like to say that you probably didn't have any business buying this book in the first place. Anyone who is or has been a biker will understand it all. Others are just being nosy or curious about it. That still doesn't give them the right to judge or give a bad review. They just don't have a clue of what brotherhood means. I thought the book told it just like it happened. Why sugar-coat anything just to make it sound better? I'd rather have mine straight up, on the rocks. Good Job Sonny!! I'm hoping there will be a Part 2 in the future!!"
2,American hero?,"He is a sad example that crime sometimes pay.Man with long criminal record and someone who is the most responsible for international growth of criminal organization named Hells Angels MC is now celebrated as an American hero.His autobiography is well written but he ""neglected"" to mention few things.For example, that Hells Angels are involved in drug trafficking and are the biggest producers of metaphetamine in the USA.Second, about violent wars with other motorcycle gangs like the Outlaws, the Mongols or the Bandidos(in Scandinavia).Third about murders within Hells Angels like about the whole chapter in Canada being destroyed by fellow Angels in the 80s(so called North Chapter). Some members were murdered, few out of fear became police informants(like Apache Trudeau who committed 43 murders for the Angels).Many other thing like this weren't mentioned either."
5,Hell's Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club,I bought this book for my brother-in-law. So I had to ask him what he thought. He told me how much he enjoyed the book. So buy this book for anybody that is a biker or a biker at heart.
5,there were 16 of these published; this was the last,"Thanks to Amazon and a certain unnameable auction site, I have finally been able to complete my collection of all the Sergio Aragones pocket-sized paperbacks ever published by Warner. There were 16 in total. Here they are by original publication date:Mad-Ly Yours! 1972In Mad We Trust! 1974Viva Mad! 1975Mad as the Devil 1975Incurably Mad! 1977Mad About Mad! 1977Shootin' Mad 1979Sergio Aragones's Mad Marginals! 1980Mad as a Hatter 1981Mad Menagerie 1983More Mad Marginals! 1985Mad Pantomimes 1987More Mad Pantomimes 1988Mad as Usual! 1990Sergio Aragones is Totally Mad! 1991Sergio Aragones' Next Mad Book 1992"
4,A must have for fans of electro/tech house,"Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass is, without question, one of the greatest electro tracks of all time. It's a dancefloor anthem that's made it to countless DJ mixes since it release. It defines a genre. ""I Do Because I Couldn't Care Less"" is one of my favorite tunes of *any* genre and adds to the star power of this record. The only bummer is that you only get the instrumental version of Playstation, whereas the single has much better versions of it, complete with rather humorous vocals."
1,This not IF from the '70's.,"Just so that there is no confusion, this is NOT the British jazz-rock band from the early 1970's. I included the one star because it was the only way to let other customers know they are two different bands. It is not a reflection on the music of this band or any of their albums."
3,No hex head on tie rod end,"Intallation was more difficult than it needed to be because there was no female hex head on the tie rod end. The part that it replaced had the hex head, so some parts do have this feature, which allows you to tighten the nut and suck the mating surfaces into contact. Without this you meed to get the tie rod end mating solidly with the pitman arm and idler arm before you tighten it."
3,Great if it were made correctly!,"I ordered this Medieval Lord Costume for my son who was studying the Medieval Ages at school and they had to wear a costume for a grade. When I received the costume in the mail, I didn't immediately open it. When I opened it to hang it up to get the wrinkles out, I found that the head piece was sewn backwards and unusable in it's condition. The sash was also missing. I contacted the seller and they stated that because I hadn't notified them within 7 days, they wouldn't accept a return or even send me replacement for the missing sash or backwards head piece. So, basically I was stuck with an incomplete costume."
4,Great costume for any fun loving boy!,"Sizing was great, costume was well made (my son did say it was a little itchy but he wore it for two events), packaged good and shipping fast~ I would recommend! I also liked that it was unique. We didn't run into a bunch of boys with the same costume."
2,"good for games, not for playing DVDmovies","I just bought one from bb last night, hook up the PS2 to my infocus 4805 projector component input.1)when playing games, it's pretty good, much much clearer than the regular RCA yellow input, no doubt.2)very very bad quality playing DVD though, even the characters in the movie(credits) don't display straight. I wonder if there's any interference, or it's the quality of the cable.I am going to return it and try the authentic PS2(only) cable from sony itself. $24.99 in Frys."
3,"Great for ps2 or xbox, but not both at once","This cable has worked well for my PS2 on both games and DVDs. It works well for the Xbox too. The cable shielding is sufficient, RCA connectors are solid. Component video connectivity is a big plus.However, if both the Xbox and PS2 are connected simultaniously, you won't be able to get analog audio through the cables. That is unless you disconnect one of the two systems, which can be a hassle depending on your audio/video setup."
4,Good quality for price,These tools are of good quality for the price. I didn't really need them to install the replacement speakers in my 1996 Avalon but some of the tools were useful. The door panels on the Avalon were held in by screws and were easy to remove using a screwdriver. I could probably make use of the various tools if I ever have to remove other auto panels or for other jobs around the house.
3,They work,"Not exactly top of the line quality, but tools work as intended....they could be a little better quality and after looking around a little, similar tools are abundant but the convenience of not having to leave home is something to consider too. Handy for the do-it-yourselfer -- popping door panels and other factory plastic panels that are on all cars these days........."
4,Missing In Action,"I only recieved 5 of 7 tools. At least I can use the ones I did get, Ive not had that problem before here. I didnt complain, it happens. The price still covers the Tools I got, and I have to have them, and I will make due without the Missing 2.edit, I did purchase this set used at reduced price,No blame on anybody."
3,Unsuccessful,"I only needed the tool for removing the GM-style spring-clip that holds on the door handle (4th tool from the left). After many unsuccessful attempts, I ended up taking the car to a shop to get the job done for $10."
2,weak effort,"Of all of Prince's output, this is possibly the weakest and most forgettable. Lacks the tongue in cheek sense of fun that pervades his most successful work. Too heavy on the kooky spirituality that mars all post-Warner efforts."
1,Borrow Before You Buy!,"Having followed Prince since 81', I agree that ""Rainbow Children"" is overbearingly religious, even in comparison to his previous work, and way overproduced. For years, I've hoped P would give up the dialogue interludes and excessive sound effects, a la ""Gold Experience"" and ""0-/->,"" and just deal with his music fans in music. This one is more production than music. This album takes itself way too seriously, and more importantly, lacks musical substance. And that's coming from a lifelong Prince fan. (Sorry P)If you want musical spirituality that will uplift you, try Coltrane's ""Love Supreme"" or a million Classical or Gospel CDs. As for the best of Prince I think it is (in this order): ""Hits/BSides,"" ""Sign O' The Times,"" ""Purple Rain,"" ""Emancipation"" and ""1999."" Good luck!If you still can't resist the urge to buy ""The Rainbow Children,"" at least borrow it before you buy. You have been warned!"
5,Wow what an awesome out of this universe project from Prince,"It seems that Prince want to bring you a Gospel-like album with ""Rainbow Childern"" without getting preachy. But that is not the case.This album was like going to a broadway play in New York City. You can close your eyes and experience the music coming to life in your mind.The music alone is mind-blowing! My personal favorite is Digital Garden and Mellow. Yet all the tracks are good. I notice there are a total of 14 tracks but really there are ""7"" hidden tracks on here as well.You may not agree with his news view as a result of his Jevovah's Witness. But that should not stop you from buying and enjoying this albumThis is one of his best work since ""Purple Rain""He keep setting his own trend and continue to raise the bar of standard in the music business. He is still untouchable!Buy this album and you will enjoy it tremendously!!!"
4,"return to name, return to form","The scattered reviews I had heard of The Rainbow Children, prior to its general CD release, were full of great praise. I had high expectations on listening to the album but it fulfilled and even surpassed them at times. It has excitement but also depth. There are songs that instantly appeal (for example, the ultra funky The Work pt. 1, or the gospel Last December). There are also songs more challenging to the pop-music ear but which definitely grow on you with each listening (like the Rainbow Children with its modern jazz feel). After releasing some albums that have been disappointing in part, Prince has returned to his former name and quality. Cool and assured, and about time. Excellent."
2,A bad CD from a Great Artist,"I love Prince, no matter what his name has been, but this CD was the last straw for me--i'll now always listen to one of his CD's before buying it. The CD has a boring confused preaching theme with a Kenny G vibe...and believe me, where i come from, Kenny G ain't a good influence. So, in the words of Jesse Johnson (and a prince bootleg), ""Do yoself a favor, walk on by..."" and instead buy the excellent Prince DVD, Live at the Alidden Theatre-Las Vegas...which is pretty good even though it is contemporary Prince."
2,Not for me,"I really tried to like this release. I forced myself to listen to it repeatedly. After several listens, I gave up. I realize that many will consider me a mere peon since I'm not head over heels in love with this release, as with all other Prince releases, but I gave it my best shot. There are a few good songs on the album, though (the titles escape me at the moment). But this is purely for the diehard Prince fan."
5,"A Real Trip...But...Nice,Jazzy, and Entertaining","Well, I can say, while I'm not a Prince follower, I'm still a big fan. I Recently picked up the Rainbow Children album at my local Rasputin Music (In Northern Cali, the next best place to go, besides Circuit City.)and was amazed by what was passing thru my speakers. It was trippy, entertaining, beautiful and had all the elements of any Prince CD minus the big time sexual content(which I do miss haha.) If Prince had chosen to go with Clive Davis to J Records however, I'm sure it would be better. 2 geniuses can do wonders as you know. But alas, it didn't happen. Still this is a good album, and is a feast for the ear."
5,Prince is the Man,"The voice , the sounds , the touch , the sensibility , the concept , the ability to be one of the greatest of All Time , the Mozart of modern times , gifted and Rocking-jazzing-funking ."
2,"Creepy ""Paul is dead"" voice ruins album","Why is it that on some occasions an incredible artist puts one seemingly obnoxious element on a CD? Is it just to test the loyalty of their constituency? Take Prince's otherwise incredible jazz album ""The Rainbow Children"" for example - that stupid pitch-adjusted voice over talking at slow-motion 3 octaves too low simply ruins everything it intrudes upon. It is so disturbing to listen to that it's hard to simply not turn off the player to get through to the rest of the music.The material itself is really great - and shows Prince's great depth and versatility. Just get rid of the #&*$# voice!!"
2,Loyal fan getting fed up with His Royal Weirdness,"I'm a loyal Prince fan - I have every one of his albums; and I have to say he has sunk to a new low with this one. The music is ok - sort of jazzy and weird. However, the lyrics and the whole concept of this album just seem dumb. He should stay away from sweeping concept albums. I would easily rate this as his worst and a major dissapointment. (By the way)the album is NOT all one track - you can skip from track to track if you want to."
3,Strange Dreams find their Destination,"An interesting album that you need to hear more than once to enjoy. I'm digging on a few of the tracks, and trying to grasp the overall idea of the artist, but it's no easy task. It's often unpredictable, sometimes fascinating, sometimes flat. There is little or no subtlety in the lyricism, as Prince delivers messages of God in a very direct way( unlike the more friendly and witty Love Sexy episode ), but the subtlety is found rather in the detailed finish of the music, which may be easy to overlook. Unfortunately, the tunes hardly jump out at me, and some of the funk sounds derivative ie: 1+1+1+3, mimics Erotic City, in my opinion_ but Prince can do whatever he wants. There's more guitar playing than on recent albums, and that nice, but you won't find much Pop ( it's no Gold Experience), and, like myself, you may find this album difficult to enjoy. But don't give up, try it a few times and see what happens :)"
4,For REAL Music fans only,"This is Prince's best album since Emancipation. He completely ignores the mainstream tosh coming out and hits us with freshly made funk with a touch of psychedelic jazz. He simply is stressing his believes and as far as I know he is actually a Jehova's Witness. But the lyrics and music blend together in a refreshing way. The highlights are 'The Rainbow Children', 'The Work pt 1'- which is a homage to James Brown, '1+1+1 is 3'- a mixture of a modern 'Erotic City' with classic George Clinton funk, 'She Loves Me 4 Me'- a relative of 'Adore' and 'Insatiable' and the last 3 tracks close a mind blowing but thought-provoking album. But it only gets four stars because the low voice is irritating. It's a shame that it is not well recognised outside the underground circuit."
5,Prince's Back on the Block!,"To the guy that said that Miles Davis would tell Prince to go back to his roots... man you're an IDIOT!! These are his roots. I mean, how more can you ask after ""THe Work""! or ""In the name of the Father"" or ""Muse to the Pharao"".Your wife banned you from playing the CD at home? Get the earplugs out of her ears or... get another wife with better musical taste.If Miles was alive he will praise THe Rainbow Children, because just as MIles Davis, Prince never cared about yhe obtuse people who only want to listen to pre- digested, bubble gummish crap. He goes beyond Funk, Soul, R&B; or whatever the heck you want to call what he does. Prince is an artist, THE artist. Absolutely buy this CD, and pay no attention to the cretins!"
5,FOLKS NEED TO STOP HATING & FEEL IT,To Prince & the NPG:Props & pounds on the most long awaited & honest work to dateAs for the listeners:(...)!(...) This work has been a long time coming. (...)This album is straight up beautiful. It's a different Prince than you are used to for sure. More fusion here than ever (maybe a little too much in some places - my only complaint.)He's way more open lyrically & T-I-G-H-to the T on production!The Rainbow Children picks up where Lovesexy left off. I take the storyline as part diary/part vision/part testimony. I dig the albums that you can't quite digest the first time.(...) (...)I couldn't begin to pick favs. It's an album that needs to be heard in its entirity. (...) Real music & talent representin on The Rainbow Children. It's the funk for real. Pick it up if that's what you're after.(...)
4,takes time...,"being a member of prince's download site, i immediately grabbed this album and listened all the way through...i was bummed. i got tripped up on the spoken word and missed the music. now i get it...and it is good. funk. jazz. religion. yes, i do believe. do you have to be a big fan to enjoy? yes, you probably do. but if you are a fan, play this album with your headphones on and just chill. in time i think you'll be pleased."
4,Prince's best since Batman.,"HI. I am a Prince fan. I like most of his work. I will admit though if you are a fan or a person that wants to buy an album with radio singles on it this is not it. If you want a musically inspired album, this is it. Prince made this album sound good, I mean it does in noway sound overproduced like most of his albums in the 90's except for Crystal Ball, and Chaos & Disorder. This is an album that is meant to be listened to all the way through at least twice, then pic your favs out. Rainbow Children has some of the finest guitar work on any Prince album, and his song Last December is probley his best overall song in a while, it is a lil long though.So in review if you want a musically AWSOME album, this is for you. If not go ahead and get another rap album to dance to, since its going to have the same beats you already like in every other album thats out there. But to me thats old and boring, this CD is not. Jazz maybe, but not boring."
4,it's not his best - but it's still pretty corking!,"(...) I questioned whether he'd gone too far this time.....?Whilst the album does not hit the highs of his earlier stuff , it is still what you come to expect from the purple one... Funk of abundance, fantastic production, a twist of the unusual and a religious underbelly.Some people found the voice-over links off-putting but It allows the concept album to flow nicely. The album reminds me of modern Harry Connick Jnr (not the big band stuff) with the voice links and mix of musical genres. If you like that - you will probably like this.Over all a very good album with a hedanistic mixture of jazz, funk, rock, catchy riffs and a few bizarre twists!"
3,Luv the Music...,"I enjoy good music and this CD does it for me. I admit the religon thing gets a little old, but the music allows me to get past that. The deep voice thing does have to go, but overall its worth buying.~Liv 4 Luv~"
3,Lost boy,"Prince, like Earth Wind & Fire, has produced a ton of very interesting, enjoyable music. But he seems lost on this record. A very uneven recording. There is a spiritual component to music, and he seems to be wandering. He doesn't seem to be in love, like Van Morrison in Astral Weeks, or angry, like Miles Davis, or happy like Cannonball Adderly. Perhaps if he made a 100% instrumental record, it would challenge him more. Maybe he should travel, and figure out what to do with his prodigious talents. But making records that frustrate his loving fans is like having a TV special with Mark Spitz treading water. Mr. Nelson is thoroughbred race horse, and he should run baby run, not goof around."
2,"An Unfortunate, Continued Downward Spiral...","Since ""Purple Rain"" I have been a Prince fan, and have always been hopeful that each subsequent release would keep me entertained and engaged in his music. Sadly, I have to say that much of what was released after The Revolution broke up doesn't hit the mark (with the exception of a few jewels here and there). Yet I still purchase the albums praying that the magic will return.""The Rainbow Children"" does not deliver, either. Yes, there are some bright spots - however as many other reviewers noted, the overbearing, over-used, and overtly-religious spoken 'voice' throughout the record kills it.I am likely to continue to hang on to my hopes and buy Prince records... but as the years and albums go by, my hopes dim more and more."
2,Misguided convert,"Music and religion were never meant to be used as weapons. This is a terribly biased and narrow-minded example of religious propaganda. Women are degraded, European-Americans are dismissed and the Jewish religion is insulted, I was appalled. I have always enjoyed the undenialble musical talent of Prince, but I cannot tolerate the ""sell,sell,sell"" of a particular ""religious"" point of view. The word ""accurate"" is used more than once in relation to his religious ""opinion"". If you can get beyond the offensive messages, the music is wonderful ."
2,Puh-leeze...instant classic it ain't!,"This is without doubt Prince's most flawed record... yet I give it two stars because the music is irreproachably fabulous. The lyrics, on the other hand, are the worst sort of prosletyzing, small-minded, racist, superstitious dreck. I for one do not appreciate being preached at, especially not by a Jehovah's Witness-wannabe who's gone mad in his old age. What happened to the little androgynous man who sang for all races, sexes, sexualities, and creeds? What happened to the simple ""God is Love"" of Lovesexy? These days those messages of hope are gone, replaced by complicated and nonsensical theology, racist remarks about whites and Jews, and sexist garbage instructing women to ""submit"" to their men. It's a damned shame that he's drifted so far from the beauty he once produced. If only there was a version of this album with no lyrics..."
1,Nadir of the North,"Prince has always mixed outstanding music with trite, embarrassing, or just plain silly lyrics. He also has an unfortunate predilection for twisting knobs on the mixing board to speed up or slow down vocals, or add distracting textures or effects to songs that would sound much better without the extra flavors. Usually it is possible to ignore the decoration to get to the music. Not this time. Paradoxically, some of his best music in years is buried under and made unlistenable by lugubrious voice-overs,recording tricks,and his most tediously didactic sermon ever. In the immortal words of Father Zappa, ""Shut up and play your guitar!"""
1,The clueless genius,"Prince has the chops and skills to put out great material. However, his extremely inconsistent material released since the last part of the nineties has turned away a majority of his fans and left him with nothing more than a hardcore following. This CD will ultimately receive little or no airplay and will only be bought by those fans. Prince has cleaned up his act and put out the most mature sounding CD of his career. However, the lack of commercial material and hooks that brought this man to fame are nowhere to be found. Prince's jazz experimentation and holy lyrics are interesting. However, the mass audience will not take this collection seriously."
4,"In the Land of the Blind, the One-Eyed Man is King","The writing, musicianship and vocals on this CD are strikingly superior to most everything else out there, and refreshing in an era where blandness and conformity have a hammerlock on today's corporate radio. Still, Prince can't resist shooting himself in the foot (and in our ear) with a truly MADDENING altered-voice spiritual narration at the start of most tracks. If not for that, this could well have been Prince's best album yet."
5,Prince - The Rainbow Children,"An impressive return 2 form 4 one of the most influential artists of the past 20 years. Musically this is as good as it gets, gone are Princes experimentations with different modern forms of music & this is back 2 basics jazz/funk with undertones of very early Prince!Thoroughly recommended 2 any Prince admirer old or new, sit back, dim the lights & get lost in the music! 100%."
4,A FIVE star Prince classic!,"This is really a Prince classic! I can't get enough of the title song: Rainbow Children. Most of the songs are really jazzy/funky: so Prince is back!This album has one BIG drawback!: the audio-technicians mastered it with a huge output level: so there are millions of clipping spikes in the recording! (Ah, so there went that fifth star...) For everyone: load the audio recording in a audio-editing application like Sound Forge or Gold Wave and look for clipping. This is really amateuristic. I think this is one of Prince's best albums musically, but audio-like it's a disappointment. I allways thought the audio sounded bad, now I know why.By the way: most people don't even hear the difference, but when you have a nice stereo-setup and really appreciate good *sound* (next to: good *music*) then beware this album.To Prince: please offer your fans a corrected MP3(256kb) download."
4,The Rainbow Children DO RISE!!!!,"Finally, Prince is getting back to using ""real"" instruments on this album. Each song has a much warmer feel and the lyrics do cause one to think--WHAT you think is up to you :-). I must admit that the low voice sequence used to narrate this ""story"" can be a bit distracting, but all's well that ends well. I would recommend that you give the album a try. Prince has had a long history of ""controversial"" music and this album is no exception. Don't let ""controversy"" scare you away from some really beautiful and insightful melodies."
1,"Boring, preachy","The last album that had any edge to it was half Of EMANCIPATION. That album is Sgt. Peppers compared to this. One good song is all I can find on this album. I think Prince is too far out in the Jesus atmosphere to ever come back down. I wish him luck, but his music stinks now. It sounds like he is falling asleep on every track. No invention or excitement. I hope MAYBE someday he will make an album on par with the quality of SIGN, god evn , THE GOLD EXPERIENCE. Yet, i dont think so. Oh, also, his new drummer is technically good, but give me Michael B. any day of the week. This new guy is too technical. Prince, MAKE ANOTHER ROCK ALBUM. Chaos and Disorder is 3000 times better than this. (...)"
1,"Oh Prince, Where Art Thou?","I have been a Prince/The Artist fan since Dirty Mind, and I have always enjoyed his ability to intermix spirituality, sexuality, and infectious grooves. Well, this time he has (IMHO) failed quite miserably. I was even able to find at least one song I liked on such clunkers like Lovesexy (I Wish U Heaven), The Black Album (Bob George) and Graffiti Bridge (Thieves In The Temple)...however...This was different.I found nothing even remotely interesting about this album! I felt as if I were being subjected to an audio televangilical broadcast half spoken by a mechanically enhanced voice.Confused? You're not half as confused as you will be after listening to Rainbow Children. But, I am not unhappy I bought it. Support his music, he'll get it right again...someday."
1,'Children' of a Lesser God,"The tip-off should've been the ""controversial new album"" sticker on the cover. Instinctively, I equated controversial with problematic. But being a once devoted fan, I bought it anyway. I should've paid attention to my instincts. ""The Rainbow Children"" is Prince formerly known as artist's attempt at a smooth jazz and soul record. Problem is, it's long on slick, soulless production and religious claptrap and exceedingly short on interesting ideas and melodies. To employ one of Prince's own tired conceits, eye believe this 1 is 4 the dumper."
1,Im not feel'n this Rainbow Children at ALL!,"Look, I been a Prince fan for a long long time. I have all the cd's. I stuck up for the man when everybody was saying he lost his R&B style. I go out and by this cd and im very very unhappy. Im not feel'n this cd at all!!! No way No how. I really feel he lost his thang after the Gold cd. It was all down hill from there. Prince if U read these reviews man. Please get back with it man. Bring the Revolution back or something. I cant even jam this in the car. Michael Jackson's new cd is 50 times better than this. And he comes out with a cd every 5 years. This Rainbow Children cd is straight garbage! Got to come better than this Prince. Like Billy said in Purple Rain ""U better kick azz on the next one Kid."""
3,Confused Again,"He is still searching, questioning, and exploring religion nothing has changed. I don't want to here his rambings about God. It's old and tired. It's Jehovah Witness stuff other times his back to his same old nasty self. Prince is still lost. Well I'm tired of looking. I have been a fan for a long time maybe too long. This music is great, if it were an instrumental it would be even better. If you don't get put off by lyrics in music then this is great for you buy it ."
5,"Something Old, Something New...","A prince fan for 20 years, this album is a pleasant return for the artist back towards really exciting music. Prince's guitar is back, as is the voice of God (or the Wise One) from Temptation from Around the World. It harks of Quincy Jones. Prince is reveling in God again which he has a long history of, maybe his new found faith (he's a Witness now), is young, but building a song like ""Willing to Do the Work"" pay homage to God, James Brown and makes me want to go door to door, frankly. He seems to be regesturing at his roots of Jones, Brown, Gospel, Jazz and identifying strongly as Africa American. I always though Prince's music was best was he was riding a stint without a female figure. The performance, composition and production shine."
3,"Same as CD-1 of ""The Winter Brothers""","""The Real Deal"" by Edgar Winter and Friends, has the same songs as CD-1 of ""The Winter Brothers"". Watch for those ""Duplication Blues""."
5,Great train set !!!!,"Easy to set up, easy to operate. Great fun I baught this for my boy who loves it! Many MAny pieces to keep you occupied by.Great set, I think I would buy a second set for myself."
1,Do not buy this dud!!!!!!,"My boy was sooooo excited to see this train - he is still playing with it without the power because it never worked. If you do not mind paying [$$$] for an electric train set that has no power, then go ahead and get a really cool looking train set."
1,Skip it,"I don't understand why Volman and Kaylan leased this material to a second-rate label with no regard for details. As others have pointed out, the extraneous gaps and overall shoddy editing make for a frustrating listen, even with the sometimes improved mastering. As much as I was looking forward to replacing my worn vinyl copies, I am sorry I spent the money for this re-release."
2,Its a plastic disc.,"While this product may be fun I was disappointed at the quality of this product in relation to the price. The product I received is not what was listed in the picture. I received the Daisy style swing, which I was intentionally avoiding, not the concentric circles in the picture. I also had to use my own rope because the rope included was much too short (I'm guessing 10 feet). I don't imagine it will hold up for very long. I was surprised that a disc swing was so hard to find. My advice to other parents/grandparents etc. find someone who is handy and make your own."
1,DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY,"I purchased the entire Ocean Wonders for dolls collection today. This is the defective one. The string that makes the seat vibrate and play music is half broke after 3 of my gentle pulls. The music will not play at all. After contacting the maker I was told that it will be a month before they can send me a new sound box. I had to sew the cover on to keep it from coming off. The other Ocean Wonders products are very nice, but I recommend buying the Chou Chou comfort seat instead of this. It is made 100% better."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!,My 6 year old bought this seat with her own money. She was very excited when she saw how real it looked (on the box anyway). It is defintely the biggest piece of junk we have ever purchased!! The seat cover never stays on. Her doll which is 15 in long barely fits (cleary states on the box it is for this size doll). This could of been made so much nicer. It was a very cute idea but awful quality. Fisher Price should be ashamed to have their name on the product.
2,fisher price,The cover of the carseat falls off alot and my daughter get fustrated because she cannot play with it for a long period of time.She always has to ask me to fix it.
1,Junk,I bought this for my daughter a couple of weeks ago and it was so flimbsy! The cover never stayed on and the clear plastic hood never would stay open. Save your money and the hastle!
4,Paintable caulk,"Have used this product for many years, always indoor, and is great as a paintable caulk on mouldings. It is not good where there is expected expansion at the caulk joint, it will fracture. First time I purchased a colored version, since I tried to match a grouted joint."
4,A good overview,"Considering the complexity of modern astronomy and astrophysics, this book does a very good job at explaining what the main questions/discoveries of astrophysics are in simple terms. I myself would complain that these issues are explored a little too superficially, although this is necessary in order to avoid introducing mathematical concepts and getting too involved. I don't think the author did a good job at describing the first wonder, the earth, but after that the book gets really good. I enjoyed it. Really, this book isn't complicated if you take it as survey. If you want to understand the fundamentals of astronomy and astrophysics, then this book is not for you, although it may help inspire future reading."
3,Convenient but...,"I'd had multiple bongos and decided to pamper myself with these for travels, etc. But I made the terrible mistake of not trying them first in a local store to hear how they sound like. At best, after a lot of tweaking, they still sound like a metal/plastic can, not like my leather regular bongos. But I do like though the convenience of having them for practice on a stand, etc. I'd save a little more and buy others with 'almost' leather like sound."
2,Not a good read,"Even though I already knew the material, I found this book painfully slow to read. The author habitually writes in sentences that are runon, convoluted, repetitive, and indirect. I kept reading passages over and over to sort out what he was saying. That goes double for the proofs.There is just not a clear unfolding of ideas at the sentence, paragraph, or chapter levels. It is even uninviting to look at; the layout is cramped and the notation is unnecessarily elaborate. The only point I can say in its favor is that it covers more material than most texts, as it is designed for a one-year course."
2,No real value for the reader in this story,"While it took courage to write such a brutally honest story, I kept thinking about this man's father. How convenient for the author to have one person on which to pin all of his problems, and how sad for the father to have no way to defend himself. Mostly I thought this book to be one long whining session with no real value to the reader."
4,Cross Cultural Experience,"The Hermitage of New Glastonbury was lucky enough to be given this book for the library. It's great. The author surveys the use of mandalas through history and by cultures around the globe. Reading the book is like taking a journey not only around the world but into the soul. Each page is rich with color photographs and artwork that not only illustrate the text but also give ideas for creating mandalas of your own. In fact the author includes instruction on mandala construction with suggested tools and materials. The author's emphasis on the common artistic and spiritual ground of humanity is a welcome message, especially at this time. The book is clearly worth the price - both for the great illustrations and for the wisdom of experience shared by the author."
1,One star for having the game on the book.,It's not that it's poorly written or even that it doesn't have info but I guess I was expecting something that would help me. If you want to learn some strategies don't buy this book. common sense will tell you what they did. I was hoping for some real good stragegy but there isn't none. But if you do want to know little stats like how much your social goes down when you're at work then yeah this is for you. and the thing on the ghost with the campfire was neat. That's about it. But don't waste your money. You can figure this stuff out at the sims.com..
1,Not what I expected from Prima!,By the game not the book! Everything in this book can be figured out in less then an hour. What also made me mad was that the new toys chapter left out some of the idems. By the livin' large stratigy guide to get just as much info on The Sims
5,Cool!,"I think this strategy guide is absolutely perfect! When I bought the SIms expansion: House Party, I didn't know what was in it and how I could handle it, but when I got this guide, it told me whats new and whats not. These amazing outfits, characters and themes made by Electronic Arts is simply a teenager's dream!!"
1,Very poor quality,"Both channels didn't come through clearly. The connections were loose so you had to jiggle them to get the stereo to come through, but it wouldn't work without holding it."
1,very poor--unusable,"This cable produced a ton of buzz and hum for me for a while, and then quit working at all. I swapped in another cable and the problems were gone. I guess for the excellent price I should have expected something to go wrong."
2,235 Regular Hard case,"I believe this product was poorly designed unlike the fantastic goggles. I ordered the original hard case. There is no snap, button, release, catch, or anything holding it together except a bump and indent. I will NOT trust this to hang on the outside of a pack as it could easiy open and drop my $100 goggles somewhere. I will have to carry it inside my pack. I do NOT recommend the regular hard case ts-235 as I am not happy with it."
5,Visually lush telling of a chilling story,"The previous viewer was right in calling this a ""non-Hollywood"" style of film-making. How fitting that the tale of a girl terrified into silence is supremely visual, and the story unfolds slowly, in fits and starts, like her own attempts to communicate. Strong performances by York, Black, and especially by the girl. It must have been a very difficult role. The isolation of the community is shown in the beautiful, but menacing, tropical island itself. Highly recommended."
2,Avoid this version,"A great album by an incredible artist, reuined by some of the most muffled and all-around miserable mastering I've ever heard."
3,The Capitol years,"Dick Dale's rawest, wildest sides were those he cut for Del-Tone between 1959 and 1963, though he can still cut up a storm. Between 1963 and 1964 he made five albums for Capitol, and it is from these that this budget CD has been compiled. With the help of Hollywood's best session musicians it can't have taken too long to knock out these tracks, but if the results can be a bit formulaic they are nonetheless rousing and stormy. There are tracks from Surfer's Choice, King Of The Surf Guitar, Checkered Flag, Mr Eliminator and Summer Surf, but none of those chosen were also on singles apart from the title track. All are in stereo."
5,Silly reviews,High end frequencies? Needle drops? I never noticed but then I listen to music to be entertained by it not to find fault with it by swallowing the dictionary.And that goes for the average listener who maybe never heard of Dick Dale or is trying out something found in Cash ConvertorsI was more interested in just who he was copying and you're hit straight away with the sounds of King Curtis' Soul Twist
4,Granular is gone,"The granular prodiem is off the market in Canada too - too bad, it was excellent. I think the elderly had trouble swallowing it, though - I suspect that is why they made the change."
2,granular product,"I don't know why Novartis took the granular Perdiem off the market either, but it is sold in Canada under Prodiem, and I saw it for sale on ebay, out of Canada.So you could try ebay, or look for a Canadian pharmacy for PRODIEM...same thing."
4,"Alright, but reminds me WAY to much of Tony Hawk 2","The third installment of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater might have better looks in some areas but really it's just a copy of Tony Hawk 2. I have figured out for almost every pro on this game, there is a con, so, i have created a list of pros and cons for you to tell you what i really think of this game:1.Pros: You can choose to skate as Tony or 13 other pro skaters.Cons: You can't play as Bob Burnquist.2.Pros: New and more challenging career mode with 8 massive levels such as Canada and Tokyo to explore.Cons: Some of the goals are so ridiculousy hard to get, you are sure to get frustrated after a while.3.Pros: Create a Skater mode is still optional.Cons: No new hairstyles or anything is available. Plus, still no option to create female skaters.4.Pros: Skate park editor is back and you can choose new styles for your parks.Cons: No new objects or sizes of parks, plus no new pre-made parks.5.Pros: Two-player games still available.Cons: No new two-player games."
3,This game's cool,"This game is a lot better on PS2 than it is on PS1, but all in all it's a cool game. If u own THPS1 and 2 then i think u might be a littl bit disapointed. Although it's a great game, it's probably not worth [price]. When THPS2 came out it had a lot more to offer than the first one. But, this one isnt quite the jump up that THPS2 was to THPS1. It's pretty much the same as the 2nd one besides the fact that it has Bam in it. But, if u have never owned a Tony Hawk game before then i think this is the perfect one for u to start out with!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,I bought this game for my playstation thinking it would be great and better than the 2nd one but it is worse. There are basically no new features on this game and the soundtrack and graphics are much worse than Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. Do not waste (the money) on this game if you want a good game buy thye second one.
2,BUYER BE WARE! THIS GAME IS BASURA!!!,"THIS GAME CANNOT COMPETE WITH THE OTHERS. the graphics are blocky, lagging, and the guys stance is terrible. because it was made by shaba, the graphics look much like grind session. it should be called grind session 2 instead of tony hawk 3. the only reason it gets 2 stars is for some super high drops that add a little fun to the game."
5,Tony Hawk's pro skater 3,"Tony Hawk. This guy is extremely well known, also, in the world of skateboarding, he's one of the best, a legend. Now, I'm not a good skateboarder or a very good video gamer but woa, when I got Tony Hawk's pro skater one for N64 I was amazed. It was an excellent, well made game. Last summer when I finaly got Tony Hawk's pro skater two I was completely stunned. It was as great as the first one! It had newer features like park editor and custom made skateboarders. Now that they have come out with number three, don't you think it will be a great success? I certianly do."
2,Be Warned,"Notice the developer of it is NOT Neversoft, they were the wonderful folks who brought us THPS1 and 2. However, they worked on number 3 for the playstation2, and handed the rights of playstation version over to some other developer. Early reviews are saying that it cant even compare with the other tony hawk games, and that the new developer totally screwed up the game. So while it may have the name, sounds like it isint going to be very good at all (PSM gave it a 4/10). Im as big a fan as anyone else, but I guess the PS2 version is a whole lot better, which sucks for us still stuck with a playstation. Too bad."
5,Good,"The products is in best shape posible i recommend the site and thanks for the service, good work and fast"
4,WASTE OF MONEY.,a lot of people likes this game but i DO NOT all you do is just skate around the place all day long. even mortal kombat4 for game boy colour is more forgiving. this game is totally junk. i have this game and it's locked away in a closet with lot's of cobweb growing on it. thank goodness is someone bought this for me and i didn't have to spend a cent on it. people wouldn't agree but this is what i think of this tony squawk game.
4,"This game is good, but not the greatest",The graphics and gameplay are great for a little while at least. But if you play it for too long it gets boring. The Create a skater and Park editor are the best parts of the game.
4,Still worth checking out,"With all eyes on the PS2, it seems like a given that the older systems would get passed over for the latest titles. Well, TH3 is available for the original PS, and it is worth the price. The levels are huge and the speed is still there. The main thing that is different from the PS2 version is the lack of people walking around the levels...big deal. Check this one out, no doubt."
1,tony hawk 3,i have played tony hawk 3 for playstation 2 and playstation 1 and it is like a totally different game it sucks for ps1 but for ps2 it i the best game dont waste money on it for ps1 you will regreat it
5,my review for tony hawk 3,This has to be the best game that is going to come out for playstation!!!! The creaters are very smart!!!! Sweet graphics!!!! The best I have ever seen!!!!
2,Fairly Dissapointing,"This DVD is titled The Zen of ""Screaming"". However, it seems to have very little to do with screaming. Melissa Cross explains in detail various ""singing"" exercises and warm-ups. I do not deny that the tips and hints that she gives in this DVD will help a vocalist. I was just expecting that the DVD would cover, in more detail, the ins and outs of actual non-pitched scream. Overall, I would say that this DVD provides a few helpful points of knowledge. However, I do not beleive that it will drastically help the development of a metal vocalist."
2,Almost useless for trained singers,"Most of this DVD is nothing but breathing techniques and warm-up exercises. If you already know how to sing, nothing new is covered here. The reason I bought this DVD was to learn how to scream and growl properly, which hardly isn't covered at all (2-3 minutes), and what's there is really poor. In addition there is far too much footage of Melissas students praising her, so that it almost seems like nothing but a commercial for her lessons."
3,Too much commentary,"Good exercises and advice for beginners, but much commentary from her students. I'd rather she just get onto the exercises instead."
5,Just what we wanted.,"My teenage son heard from a friend about this CD. He and his friends love to get together and play their ""screamo"" music, and whatever comes to mind. My son wanted to learn to sing screamo without damaging his throat. He said this CD helped him develope that technique very quickly and easily."
3,Not terrible.,First off this dvd does not teach you how to scream. It teaches you how to scream 'properly'. I cant scream and was interested in learning. This dvd was of no use to me. Apart from Angela Gossow and Randy Blythe I do think all of her students sound very similar which in the saturated world of metal is not a great thing. Just scream your balls off at least that way its your style.
3,pretty good,"you have to know how to scream! this will not teach you how to scream! that's the only thing sucky, which is pretty huge."
4,Buena Herramienta para todo vocalista,"Definitivamente es DVD es excelente herramienta para todo vocalista de metal, no es dificil de entender con buenos concejos de los artitas que aparecen en el....... de las cosas que mas agrado fue que se preocupan en el rango de la vos del comprador ya que en Cd puedes entrenar segun tu rango por ejemplo si eres baritono, tenor, soprano etc.......Lo que si creo que le hace falta, son los sub titulos en español o lenguaje ya que solo tiene ingles, razon por la cual le doy 4 estrellas, pero en lo demas creo que es una buena herramienta para el pricipiante como para el vocalista con experiencia........estoy ansioso por comprar The Zen of Screaming: Vocal Instruction for a New Breed Vo 2......saludos desde Honduras"
5,voice saver,wanna sing like a madman (or madwoman) and not lose your voice? then buy this dvd. 3 hours of info on how to do the job right without tearing your voice up.
1,"CD=lessons, DVD=Infomercial","This seems to be like any other vocal warm-up, exercise audio you can get.The DVD is an ""Infomercial"", it's like they were going to put it on late night tv and didn't, so thought, ""what the hell, .. lets put it in the product to look like it's more than just a cd audio""..The product really is just the cd audio with do-re-mi like exercises. caveat emptor."
4,Save Yourself,"This is a great tool for protecting your voice. I've had tons of throat problems over the years and this DVD has really helped me be able to find my voice again - without pain! The only drawback is that as you watch the DVD over again to get the instruction you have to keep watching the other guys give their opinions and experiences on the method. I wish it were cut or tracked so that you could just skip to the next bit of information without wading thru the commentary.But otherwise it's a valuable tool. Thanks, Melissa!"
2,Too bad this is more advertisement than lesson...,"I heard Melissa Cross on NPR and immediately bought this DVD, excited to learn how to scream without hurting my voice. I was disappointed to find the disk is about 55% advertisement for Ms. Cross, 44.5% standard vocal warmups and exercises, and 1 or 2 minutes of vague information on screaming.I'm sure the vocal warmups are helpful for those who are too ""hip"" to take voice lessons, but if you've ever had a voice lesson, there isn't much you haven't heard before here. If you are interested in watching various metalheads praise Melissa Cross, then you'll love this DVD. But if you already have the least bit of vocal training and just want to learn how to apply it to screaming, be aware that the material here is pretty thin."
3,A little Disappointed...,The information you are looking for is in here. The thing that made me disappointes is that for the most part it is an ad for Melissa Cross. She seems like an awesome teacher. I just wish that it was more information on technique than Melissa Cross plugs.
1,This is a huge publicity stunt and is a waste of money.,"Well, first of all, I am the lead singer for my band. I am a very good singer, I've had many singing lessons and am in choir. I know how to sing from my diaphram and sing with the correct vowel sounds, have good vibrato, and falsetto. BUT!! I wanted to learn how to SCREAM. I have done a few shows with a hardcore band and screamed for them and just devestated my throat. I wanted to learn how to SCREAM correctly and this dvd will not teach you how to SCREAM. It may say it does, but it does not. Pretty much the first hour of stuff was stuff I already knew about singing. She mentions how to make your voice scratchy in about 3-4 sentences and THATS IT. I need further explanation. I am extremely extremely angry because I just wasted my money on a crappy factless infomertial for Melissa Cross. This dvd sucks!"
4,This DVD has saved my voice!,"I used to feel a scratching in the back of my throat if I sang for more than half an hour, and a full hour of singing at proper volume sometimes caused my voice to wear out completely.Since watching The Zen of Screaming and doing the included vocal exercises before every rehearsal and every show, I can now sing SO much better, at full strength for at least 5 hours. My range has improved, my tone has improved, and most importantly, my confidence has improved.The CD of vocal exercises can be loaded onto your iPod so that you can quickly do them on the run to the gig!Melissa makes it fun, with terms you can visualize and remember easily. I rave about this DVD to every musician & spoken word performer I know. I'm sure I've become annoying! But it WORKS!!!"
5,"Simple, Sincere and very useful","I really liked the depth on which Melissa explains and guides you to utilize your OWN musiccal instrument. Very easy to follow and most importantly, not boring at all. You really feel that you are in one of her classes. Thank you Melissa!."
5,Solid Product,Does what their supposed to. Well made and easy to use. Transported 2 expensive motorcycles and never had an issue. Would buy again. A+
4,A real keeper!,Purchased this product to transport my Honda CBR 929. Exceeded all of my expectations.. The only knock I have against this product is that I received it in tan and the advertised item is black.
4,Simple and effective,"Nothing too fancy here, but they work great for transporting a motorcycle. Just loop them over the handle bars, attach a tie down to the other end, and anchor it. Simple and does the job."
1,"Soft Tie Down, poor quality","I have bought and used several tie downs and soft tie downs. These are the thinnest and poorest quality I have come across. I do not trust what they are rated for. It is not worth the trouble to return them, I am just going to throw them out. Don't waste your money."
4,keeper tie down,"Works as expected. One of the loops was sewn wrong so it has a twist in it, otherwise they are fine."
2,Keeper 5729 Soft Tie Extension,"Just a heads up if you are ordering this product. I thought I was getting them in black cause the picture Amazon has of the product is black. When I opened the package, they are ""Beige"". The site does not give you a chose of colors. I wish they had told me the color, I would have ordered a different brand that had ""black"". Can't return them cause I need to use them tomorrow. Relocating to another city, or I would send them back.Keeper 5729 16"" Soft Tie Extension Tie-Down, 800 lbs. WLL (2500 lbs. break strength) 4 Pk."
4,tie downs,I returned these before opening box the picture shows tie down hooks they dont have any tie down hooks the packaging was ok.
4,Incredible Science-Fantasy,"A strange invasion is happening in Viriconium. In the wake of an eldritch fog smelling of lemons people are changing; reality is reshaping. This is Harrison's second installment in the Viriconium series, and though it stands alone, reading Pastel City first will increase empathy for several of the characters involved. I am sure this is a book with underlying themes and deep meanings; it read that way. I just don't know what they are. Harrison's writing is beyond me, and maybe that's why I like it so much-it challenges. Storm of Wings showcases unique and unforgettable characters blundering their way through barely explainable events in which most times they are as perplexed as the reader. I wholeheartedly recommend the entire Viriconium series to readers who enjoy bewildering science-fantasy. Harrison does not disappoint."
3,Much ado about not much,"Good but not great. Although considered a comedy, this one lacks the sparkle of ""Merry Wives of Windsor"", ""Loves' Labour Lost"", or some of the others. It was a long slow wind-up of misunderstandings and heated emotions that resolves itself in the last scene. ""Merry Wives"" had some real laugh out loud moments, even reading the script. These were conspicuous by their absence. I suspect there were current events at the time of the first stage production of ""Much Ado"" that were hinted at in the play, providing the true comedy that is not obvious to the modern reader. It comes across as protracted and deliberate misunderstandings, and has too much of a ring of truth to be hilarious. There were, however, many quiet smirks as I read, from having seen similar behavior only 400 years removed from the penning of this manuscript.Still, it's better than ninety-nine percent of the dreck written in the past decade.E.M. Van Court"
4,Much Ado About Nothing Review by me!!!,"Much Ado About Nothing starts off with the men comming back from war. When Claudio sees Hero,Leonato's daughter, he falls in love with her and asks her hand in marriage. While they are falling in love Beatrice and Benedict hook up. Don John deceits Claudio and Hero by making him believe that Hero was dishonest to him before their wedding. Hero has to pretend she's dead because she discased her father,((but she is acctualy inacent)). It all works out at the end and they find out about Don John's plan, and Beatrice and Benedick get married. I thought that this was a good book i got lost in the begining but the movie helped! And once I understood what was going on i realy got into it."
1,much ado about nothing,"characters:Claudio, Hero, Leonato, Benedick, Beatrice, Don John and Don Pedrothis book cantains many romantic acts. Claudio falls in love with Hero and marrys her. Benedick who swears he will never fall in love, Can you guess what happen??? yes thats right he fall s in love with his worst enemy, Beatrice...i really didn'y like this book. i thought it was pointless and boring and really hard to understand."
5,Much Ado About the Play,"I feel it is necessary to dispute some of the prior reviews I have just read. Shakespeare is a magnificient writer and Much Ado About Nothing is no exception. Some people have written that it is difficult to understand his language; however, the Folger Shakespeare Library has notes on the left page to explain vocabulary that modern readers may not understand. These notes also explain phrases that are no longer used such as ""civil as an orange"" which is a similie (with the orange being a Seville orange) having the meaning of ""between sweet and sour"".Much Ado About Nothing is a witty comedy with enjoyable banter between Beatrice and Benedick, an ironical storyline, and humorous characters such as Dogberry whose malapropisms bring a smile to the reader's face."
2,"""Modern Perspective"" makes you long for the Middle Ages!","The play, of course, is fabulous and funny, but Professor Gail Kern Paster's ""Modern Perspective"" at the end of the Folger edition really takes all the fun out of this! A feminist viewpoint is often helpful, but she just kills this thing and hurls countless arrows at marriage. No, marriage isn't perfect, but Professor Paster calls it a ""private terrifying world"" as if every Elizabethan-era husband locked their wife in a tower! Excuse me, Beatrice allowing herself to be treated like that? After reading this edition, I bought a different one!!!"
1,I dislike this book,"I think this book could take someone who loves Shakespeare and make them hate him. It was confusing unorganized and labeled incorrectly. One second your reading the Shakespeare version the next your doing English, you'll be confused and delete the product off your kindle and be out the dollar you spent save your money!"
5,Love's Labors,"Claire McEachern's Arden edition of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" is obviously a labor of love. She admits in her preface that this is her favorite Shakespeare plays, and her good-humored speculations on the views of other editors involved in the Arden series give an early indication of the insight and generosity of spirit that make her introduction such a pleasure to read. There are many good editions of this play available, but for the reader who wants to get the fullest sense of the riches of this play, this one is the best I've encountered. Several editions of the play, for example, will make sure the reader knows the wordplay involved in the play's title (and a careful reader of ""Hamlet"" will know at least one of the secondary meanings of ""nothing""), but McEachern makes full use of her extensive introduction to show just how fully that chord of meanings sounds the themes of the play as a whole. This is scholarship that illumines, not dissects."
4,Much Ado About Nothing,"Much Ado About Nothing is a romantic play by William Shakespeare. This play takes place in the late 1500's, in Messia, Italy. The main characters consist of Claudio, a young successful prince, Hero, a young lady, Benedick, an experienced solider, Beatrice, Hero's cousin, Don Pedro, the leader of the group of soldiers, and Don Jon, the illegitimate brother of Don Pedro. Hero and Claudio fall in love; Beatrice and Benedick also fall in love. Hero is betrayed and this false account could cause her innocent death.At first this play is difficult to comprehend, but as the book progresses, you have a greater understanding of Shakespeare literary work."
3,Charlie-Holy Angels- Much Ado,"Much Ado About Nothing by William Shakespeare is a very well written book. It is a story of love and misconception that has many double meanings and subtleties. The main characters are Hero, Don Pedro, Benedict, Beatrice, Claudio, and Don John. It is about Claudio's love for Hero, and how many times, Don John tries unsuccessfully to spoil his love and their wedding. In the end, Don John's master plan is destroyed and he is caught. Claudio and Hero get married. I thought the book was well written but it was hard to understand and not very interesting. On a scale of one to five, I would give it a three."
5,Always get Folger additions for teaching,"I am teaching this play to my class, and I find that folger editions are excellent in that they have thorough notes and I enjoy the additional pieces in the intro, as well as the modern perspective pieces at the end. Great play-- especially if you want to discuss the play in terms of sexism."
5,Quite lovely....,"I've read and watched this play many times, but found this version useful for helping a fellow classmate understand the play as well as to take notes in conjunction with my annotated copy. Definitely worth the price, especially for those with a limited vocabulary."
1,Bare Bones edition of play,There are no notes of any kind in this edition. There isn't a list of the cast of characters. Just bare bones! Not satisfactoryat all!
3,"Much Ado About Nothing ""t hus"" {For misso}","I thought this was great love/ comedy. The only thing that I didnt like is the fact that this book was so predictible. The main characters are don john, Don pedro, Claudio, Her, Leonato, Margarret, Ursula, Beatrice, and Benedick. Beatrice and Benedick fall in love at the end of the book as well as Hero and Claudio. As in a good old novel, the couples live happily ever after and this is my only complaint towards this book. 3 stars! Thanks."
5,"""Teen Idol"" is one of my teen idol books!","I really liked this book 'cuz i just did! So you should read it 'cuz it iz a really good book with cool characters and a awesome theme with the ""famous movie star iz cuming to town"" theme and everything. My favorite part of the book iz when Jenny iz remembering when her best friend iz calling her ""mayonaise""! That's a really funny part! i hope that you read this book 'cuz if you read this book by Meg Cabot then you will be staying up all night trying to finish it!! :) :) :) :) :)"
2,teen trauma,"Jen Greenly has a lot on her plate. She is the school's Ask Annie advice columnist, although no one knows her identity. She is the model student, which makes her the perfect choice for a guide. When superstar Luke Striker comes to her small town and public high school to research a part, her principle assigns Jen to take care of him. It goes fairly well, until he's discovered. As Jen finds herself at the center of a mob scene, she starts to realize some things. Between helping everyone solve their problems and advocating for all the misfits, Jen has no time to deal with her own problems.......like her crush on her best friend Scot (who has a girlfriend), and the possibility that the biggest superstar in America might be in love with her. Can Jen deal with everything and get the guy.....or will she buckle under the pressure?"
2,the true idol,This book was one of my favorites! My favorite part about this book was probably all the different issues Jenny is trying to overcome as a high-schooler. it's a book any girl will enjoy and can relate to in some ways.
4,Great!,"Another awesome book from Meg Cabot. She can totally suck you into her books...Teen Idol is a must read, well for a girl of course!"
4,very good,This is a really good book. I've read a lot of Meg Cabot and this doesn't disappoint. Though I found it kind of hard to believe that no one would recognize the heartthrob I still really enjoyed it. Great read for any time.
3,sloww.,"Okay, this book is sooo slow. Nothing happens, like, at all. She meets someone famous. She ruins the senior prank. She gives a teacher back her doll. That is basically everything!"
4,I absolutely love it...... but.....,"I really enjoyed this book. I thought that the characters were fun (although, not as developed as I would have liked or expected), the story/plot was cute, and the ending wasn't stereotypical. My only problem with this book is just that it wasn't written with as much depth as Meg Cabots other books. In all her other books, the characters seem to be really defined and we know a lot about them and how they think and feel, but with the main character in this book, we only see how she feels about things happening in her high school. It's entertaining, and if you like Meg Cabot's other books you'll like this one too, but I still think that ""The Mediator Series"" is her best work yet.So, should you buy this book? Yeah, why not? You'll probably love it :)"
3,Qué hay y qué no hay en este libro,"Para empezar, el título es engañoso: de sus 450 páginas 245 son de poesía, sólo 40 páginas tienen brevísimos escritos en prosa de la autora y los estudios ocupan el resto. Estos estudios son en realidad comentarios de extensión variada (los muy largos ocupan unas doce páginas, los breves unas dos líneas) que aparecieron en periódicos u otras fuentes bibliográficas. La edición no tiene notas a pie de página ni introducciones. Lo bueno del libro es que reúne buena parte de la poesía que ya es casi inconseguible. Una edición que recomendaría sólo si no hay nada más que comprar."
2,"twist-on doesn't always work, expensive lamp module","Twisting the flashlight on sometimes doesn't work. I've done my best to ensure that this is not operator error: the internal tray, lamp module, and spring are undamaged and all parts are clean; the batteries are good, the spring seats well. It looks like a design (or quality control) flaw, in that the tabs from the battery tray do not go up far enough to contact the lamp module until the lid is tightly seated, causing inconsistent operation and leaving no additional leeway for metal component wear. Sometimes a small whack at that point will get it on, and reassembling it may help - hit or miss. Coming on every time is pretty much job one for a flashlight. My other complaint is that a replacement xenon lamp module is half the cost of the flashlight at ~$11, hydrogen-absorbing catalyst pellets or not. Two stars for a sturdy case."
2,"Overpriced, with switch problems","This flashlight eats batteries! The light is good; very sufficient for plant and refinery work. My problem is that you think the flashlight is off by twisting the lamp until the light goes off and a quarter turn but it isn't. I wind up putting a fresh set in every week. I could pull the 2-C batteries every time I use it but that's awkward.After using this flashlight for 4 months I give up. I am going with a Pelican 2100 with a traditional switch.If this review was helpful, please add your vote. Thanks."
4,"Wow, now that's fresh air...","I've had this for about 2 days and was returning to purchase another for my wife's car. This is the first time I've used something like this, usually favoring something that smells and merely covers odors. But this thing, I'm amazed. I'm leary of something that just sits there, creating no noise, showing no mechanics of it working other than the blue LED being on. But it's doing it thing cause I've definitely noticed odors are gone & air quality differences since having it. And the kicker is, I'm a smoker. So returning to my vehicle (refraining from a smoke...hey, it's a smoking cessation device too!...who knew... :) and the air is C L E A N. I'm amazed. Ok..gotta order..."
3,is it really working?,"This product looks sleek and hi-tech, and it's certainly easy to use. Its efficacy, though, is a little disappointing. I guess it's one of those cases where ""no news is good news"", but I can't feel the difference!"
1,Pretty Light,"The only thing this is good for is emitting a pretty light that looks cool at night time. Did not affect the odor, dust or anything else in my car...its pretty much useless. Don't waste your money, buy a flashlight instead...its cheaper"
2,they dont specify electic current requirements,the product specifications do not state that it requires 24 volts to operate normally....but it does say this on the package........I bought for my dad and it will not work in his truck.
3,not jumbo stamps,"These stamps are nice, but they are advertised as the ""Jumbo Alphabet Stamps"" and they are not. They are the small ones."
5,Great centers,This is a great teaching tool. great for literacy centers in the primary grades. Use with teaching alphabet writing your name or even sight word practice
4,letter stamps,I teacher kindergarten and this is a very motivating center for students to practice writing words. The case is a little flimsy and broke on one set the first day. The letters at the bottom of the case help students put them away while practicing their letters/ Definitely worth it
5,READ THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION!,The product description tells you exactly what's on the dvd. Some fighters are VERY amateur. Others are up and coming pros. Josh Burkman's VERY FIRST FIGHT is on here. Burkman is currently ranked #5 in the world at welter weight and is 3-0 in the UFC. This is 'grass-roots MMA'. That means the fighters are BRAND NEW! If you are looking for highly skilled Jiu Jitsu blackbelts. This one's not for you. If you want to see some guys slug it out........It's the bomb!
5,The absolute best angling book I've ever read!,"This is absolutley the best fly-fishing reading a person could ever do. Not only does this book provide insightful, narrative essays about NW fly-fishing but also delivers an enviornmental messages about the decimation of this areas one-time great fishing. I read this book every winter and each time it unfolds a new idea of fly-fishing for me. Where are the rest of his books?"
5,The ugly Truth,"Any Teenager should have read this book or at least have seen the movie. This is not a fictional Story, it's the ugly Truth that most people don't want to know. Instead of pointing the Finger at the Addicts, people should get a bare impression of what they go through everyday and how easy it is to become an addict. For me, the most shocking thing about this book was, that if I would have been in that scene (Berlin 70's), I would surely also have become a junkie. This book should be read in every school, it would be actually something that we could LEARN from. Although it is certainly not a listening pleasure, everyone that is barely interested on what can go wrong should read it."
5,slow down and get relaxed,If you actually follow the instructions in the book and *take your time* going through the program - it works! I feel so relaxed when I use the routine in this book. It shows you a deeper face of yoga - not the superficial exercise class at the gym - but how to slow down and tune into your inner self.
3,The Mysteries of Music,"Look deeper inside, that's what it takes to find what you are looking for. Plus some courage to experiment if your ideas are right or wrong. In the Devil in Music Julian Kestrel, an English dandy who is touring Europe decides to come to a villa on the Lake Como in Italy to solve a mysterious death of a nobleman Marchese Lodovico. He also has to reveal the identity of a breathtaking tenor who is only known as Orfeo, a singer from Greek Myths. See through the masks every character finds essential to wear, not miss the expression put in every word spoken and unthread the webs that every music note beholds in order to find the murder and answers to all the questions is Julian's duty but he'll have to pay a high prize."
5,Involving,"While I generally avoid books in excess of 400 pages, I decided to try this one based on all the positive comments from other readers. I was not disappointed!Multiple suspects, great characters, a wonderful atmosphere, and of course, revelations and many twists.All of the characters are wonderfully developed, so much that I could attach faces to the descriptions. The setting made me think of Dumas and the Three Musketeers, and the relationship between the detective and his travelling partner brought to mind Sherlock Holes and Dr. Watson. The twists, turns, and revelations actually seemed plausible and in case somewhat foreshadowed. However, the ending completely caught me off guard (which was a good thing). There are so many characters and so many possible motives that the reader will be kept guessing.A long book, but very involving and well written. I am going to try another by the author."
5,Layers of suspense,"It is a fitting end to the Kestrel series! The plot initially moves rather glacially. But your patience to stick with it is rewarded. The prose is beautiful, the author is not lazy with her descriptions and really gives you a feel for Italy and its politics while not letting that weigh the story down.And the ultimate suspense had my jaw hitting the floor lol! And I felt awed by it for a day or two :)"
5,Required reading,"The average U.S. citizen's knowledge of the world is woefully inadequate. For citizens of a supposed representative democracy that has so many irons in so many global fires, this is inexcusable. Our knowledge of Afghanistan (and the Central Asian region) falls deeply into this dynamic. Ted Rall goes a long way toward ameliorating this problem with this book. His first-hand analysis of the complex and bloody politics of Afghanistan put the 2001 U.S. invasion of this horribly beleaguered nation into a valuable perspective."
5,Rock Solid!,Stanek rocks the Web world with this incredible how-to guide on Web site promotion. I got an in depth preview of the book at http://www.tvpress.com/promote/ and I must say I am impressed
5,Awesome Web site set up for this book!,"I have been following William Stanek's writing for some time (ever since Web Publishing Unleashed blew me away!) Recently, I tracked down the Web site for this book. Although I honestly can't review a book I haven't seen, I can say there is a ton of great information and resources at the Web site for this book. If the Web site is any reflection of the book, this is really going to change the way everyone thinks about Web promotion. Check out the Web site at http://www.tvpress.com/promote/ -- KylePSI've already put in my advance order for the book and based on what I've seen anyone that is interested in getting their Web site noticed and increasing their Web traffic should as well."
1,This book is a fake.,"The author's blurb tells us he fought Saddam Hussein. Thecover quotes Denis wright, david taylor and other fictioal nonentities to praise the book. I am convinced the author or his buddies wrote al the glowing reviews. Page 55-73 are just logs. Absolutely no information. Just like the rest of the book. Mr Stanek, go back to your day time job."
2,Basic and filled with (outdated) tricks,"This book, written in 1998 and revised in 2000, by Internet time standards can be considered outdated at the time of this writing (August 2002). The author unfortunately touched on a number of Web sites and tactics that nowadays are either dead (Web sites) or considered bad internet marketing practices (redirecting, use of link farms) that could actually get you delisted. The section on traffic analysis at least talks about a professional tool (WebTrends) but then goes down a long and unnecessarily technical talk about web logs that is sure to bore the heck out of non-technical readers. If you don't mind getting spammed big time, by registering for some of the services the author recommends that are still around, and don't mind dropping in the ranks of Google at all, then get this book and follow its advice. Otherswise, download (and pay) for a license of WebPosition Gold and read the book that Amazon sells about it."
3,Good starter book for web promotion,"If you have never promoted your site and don't know the first steps, this is a good stating book. However, I found that I was already doing the things the author recommended and I wasn't getting the big number of hits I wanted. While the book shows straight forward ways to promote your web site, there aren't any tricks or secrets to give you an edge over the other 1 million web sites out there. If you are already listed in search engines and have well defined META tags in your web pages and want to find that extra idea to push you over the top, you probably won't find it here. However if you are new to site promotion, this is a good start."
2,Very basic...tactics & info is available for free on the net,"I did not have very high expectations for this book. After all, you are talking about ideas and concepts that change frequently and drastically. If you have never worked to promote your web site, then this is not a bad choice for an introduction. I like the way the author breaks down log files, talks about organizing your stats, etc.However, web site promotion is a very dynamic and fast moving area of the Internet. This book will let you know how much you don't know. But if you want to actually learn more about promoting your site, go to the web and read the online sources. There are many free discussion boards, newsletters, etc. that will cut right to the heart of promoting your site. The concepts and beginning points outlined in this book are a good place to start, but it's like publishing a Yellow Pages for web sites, as soon as you do it...it's out of date and innacurate.See ya"
2,facile and inadequate,"Stanek gives an easy to follow guide to (maybe) cranking up your web traffic. He shows which search engines you can submit your web pages to. Plus, several directory or portal sites that might have free or paid inclusion.But he also suggests having games or quizzes with prizes on your website to further garner an audience. Quite aside from the cost, I'm not sure this is so useful for some sites.There is some elementary analysis of your web access log. So you can get a measure of how successful your efforts are. But this chapter is very inadequate. There are free analysis tools available; instead of thumbing manually through the log.If you are tempted by this book, then there is a far better and more sophisticated treatment given in ""Search Engine Marketing"" by Moran (IBM 2005). It contains more helpful and better written details on how to write your web pages. Makes Stanek's book appear very facile and inadequate."
3,Needs updating,"Many of the ""free"" promotional sites listed in the book now only provide fee-based listings. However, any Internet book that is three years old will undoubtedly include some outdated material. I would like to see an updated version. Even with this limitation, I successfully updated a couple of the business sites I maintain, including www.medresearchnow.com.Brad"
5,Stanek does it again!,Stanek had me hooked on his writing ever since Web Publishing Unleashed. As someone else said he's not afraid to tell it like it is and provides great insight into what ever topic he tackles. I liked Increase because it is a hands on book that helps you learn a great deal about promoting a home page or web site. I believe the book is ideal for promoting personal and business. Try it I think you will agree.
4,Do it all without spending a penny!,"I was pleased by all the links this book points out. Get your pen ready, and create a log book to keep track of all the places you submit your site. But best of all--and I can't believe the publisher doesn't highlight this--the book tells you how to promote the heck out of your site without spending a dime!"
1,There Has To Be A Better Book,"I have done everything he said to do in this book and still, just the usual handfull of traffic. I used the included CD ROM. Most of the applications do not work. After using the submission software, I didn't get and increase in traffic, but I got a huge increase in my e-mail spam! I believe all this book is about is increasing traffic to the author's website (clever), and submitting readers' e-mail addresses for spam mail."
1,Half of the Book is Useless,This book is obsolete! Can't believe that the author is still promoting mass spamming on the Internet. Don't waste your money on this book. There are better books out there.
1,THIS BOOK IS TRASH!!!!!!!!!,"WHATEVER YOU DO DONT BUY THIS BOOK>>>IT IS A FAKE. LIKE ""HOW TO MAKE YOUR FIRST MILLION!!"".The ideas in this book are way too basic and most of it is spamming.Afcourse if you just wanna through your money away buy this book or the one about the first million."
2,Very little content,"The title advertises that the books has a very low content to size ratio...and the book delivers. I was able to read the book in two hours, and really didn't get a full 15 minutes worth of new information.The author inflates the size of the book with a large number of graphics and tables without any content. He has several pages showing results from a Unix grep command. Most of the information in the 1998 edition is irrelevant today. Fortunately, I read a library copy and don't feel gyped.The reading is very easy, and may be worth a very quick scan, but I would not recommend spending the money."
5,Every Web publisher should have this book!,"Mr. Stanek has created a terrific how-to guide for Web promotion! No matter what skill level you are you should have this book on your bookshelf. Buy it. You will use it time and again.The book covers much more than Web promotion. You'll find complete details for tracking visitors, hits and other key stats. You'll also find tips for using these stats to improve your Web site. This book has paid for itself many times over."
2,Sophmoric,"I don't understand all the rave reviews here. This book is way too basic for anyone but novice web marketers. If you've been managing web sites for a while, don't waste your money."
5,Paws up!,We try different treats for our dogs and they seem to like the Holistic Select biscuits very much. This has good quality ingredients just like their kibbles which our dogs like as well.
4,My Dog Doesn't Complain!,My dog seems to like these just fine. I only give him Holistic Select products due to his sensitive gastrointestinal system.
5,A courtroom drama with a twist,"This book is written from a point of view of Clarissa - a woman standing trila for murdering her ex-lover. The problem is ... she can't remember it. Having amnesia after a car-wreck (which happened a cople of hours after the estimated time of the murder), she is herself questioning her own guilt.Allthough amnesia as a plot device was horribly overused in books, movies and TV, it works good here. The court scenes are solid and sometimes brilliant.The characters of the novel are lifelike, and the relationships between Clarissa, her lawyers and her inmates could keep your interest even without the mystery part of the novel.This may be not as strong as ""Presumed Innocent"", but definetly one of the strongest debute legal thrillers since then.Fans of Scott Turow should check out this book."
1,Don't sell junk on Amazon.com,"The is the worst monitor we have ever bought. The lifespan only lasts about 4 month. When the monitor was 4 month old, the screen started going to dark when I just turned on the computer. We need to re-turn on the monitor again and again. The condition was getting worse, finally even you re-turn on the monitor 20 times, the monitor may work one time. This product has no warranty. The product description on the Amazon says that it is made by Viewsonic, and I think that is cheating, there is no any viewsonic mark on the monitor. Don't waste you money on this product."
4,"ViewSonic Q19wb-1 19"" Wide LCD Monitor","I've always liked viewsonic for their quality and reliability. This monitor performs well for it's price range. I'm satisfied with it except the built in speakers are pretty cheesy. You can't adjust the speakers at all. So the sound is very tinny with no bass or mids what so ever.Overall it works well for a low end LCD monitor, just turn the volume down on the built in speakers and get external ones."
4,We really like this monitor,I am very pleased with this monitor. It was also a great price. I like that is is a wide screen too.
1,Warning-Do Not Buy This Product,"We purchased our LCD Screen in January, it is now March and lines come across bad as snow... The monitor is all but useless at this point and my wife only uses the second computer a few hours a day... With a 1 week, no open carton return policy, we just ate the 200+ dollar cost of this... Will stick to cheap LCDs like the one for our other computer which, at 2/3rds the cost and a year older is still holding up great. REAL DISAPPOINTMENT after trying to buy a bit better monitor."
4,Have owned for over 15 years,"I have a pair of these small lamps with gimbals mounted in my boat saloon. They throw off a tad more light as a candle - it has a flat wick of about 1/2"" wide - certainly will not create enough light to read (not even close). If you're looking for more than mood lighting, look for a lamp with a round wick. Over the years, my lamps have developed a dull, brass patina and look wonderful - much more durable than other lamps I purchased around the same time that must be brass plated, not solid brass. These little guys have gotten awfully expensive - I think I paid about $75 for mine with gimbals back in the early 1990's."
5,Data Communications Handbook published by Signetics Corp,This book was a collectors item when it first came out in 1978! It was subsequently revised several times with the last version published about 1983. It was used as a textbook at several universities!
5,Cracking the GRE Subject Test in English Literature,"I bought this book the summer before I took the subject test in English Literature and it turned out to be an absolutely invaluable resource. I used both volumes of the Norton Anthology of English Literature and also the McGill series to augment my studying. By the time test day came, I was able to finish the exam half an hour early--with a score of 93%.Beware, however: the actual test included more questions about theory and 20th century authors than the Princeton Review book warned. But this a decidedly minor flaw on the whole. Indeed, anyone who says it's impossible to crack the subject test in literature hasn't read this book!"
3,"Good, not great","This book definitely helps take away some test anxiety by explaining that it is ok to be overwhelmed by how difficult the test is. It gives great studying tips and explanations for the exam.I must confess that I admire that this book admits that it cannot cover everything; however, it left out a major components that were on my exam. I took the exam in April '07 and was slammed in the face with post-modern and even contemporary literature from around the globe. Tough questions, not the basics that we all should know by now. Also, the criticism questions dealt with things not even mentioned in the book. I'm talking like 20% of the test being on things I never anticipated. So much for getting rid of test anxiety.To be fair, I have yet to find any kind of study help for this growing section of the exam. Just be advised that this book skipped it completely. So you'd better find it elsewhere."
4,"Very entertaining, but in an attempt to be fast paced in the later chapters, too much is left out","The somewhat too quick ending, is something this book shares with more famous Russian thriller writer Martin Cruz Smith in his Arkady Renko novels - they also seem to rush so much near the end, that it is a little difficult to actually understand what is going on.That aside though, this is an engaging and interesting thriller from the author of Siberian White - and this book is better than Siberian White.All in all, I'll keep Robin White on my authors to look for list."
5,Best album of the band,"Yes, after listening this album (many times) - that wonderful ambient background in Rain In Tibet, the playful presence of wide range of instruments in the tracks - I think this is the best. That doesn't mean the others aren't worth listening, just that's the most harmonic one. And thanks for Balint (Radio Tilos) who recommended that group to me. Maybe that was the first step..."
5,A head start to sign language,"My daughter has loved this book since she got it at 7 months old. She's now 2 and still loves it. The ""animal"" motions quickly became a sign language for each animal, enabling her to name animals much sooner than spoken language allowed. On zoo trips, she'd tell me what each animal was, using the motion desribed in the book: at the giraffes, she'd bend her neck enthusiastically, at the elephants, she'd stomp her foot, etc... She learned one motion at a time, starting with the seal, and it's been great fun for all of us to watch. Especially the shoulder-shrugging buffalo. It's inspired us to invent other animal motions, and there's just no stopping us now. I get this book now for any friend with a 7-18 month old, and it still promises years of fun. It also helped her learn body parts, even less basic ones like neck and shoulders. Get this book and then have fun expanding on the theme!"
5,A GREAT gift for 1-2 year olds and beyond!,"This is my 14 month old's favorite book. It is a real joy to watch her learn these movements. It started at around 10 months with the hand clapping, and now she's bending her neck, wriggling her hips, stomping her feet, and just last week she started raising her shoulders. I plan to make this a staple birthday gift for 1 and 2 year olds. As many reviews suggest, this can be a favorite for many years. You truly can't go wrong with this one! I should note that we have the board book version which is great for the younger page-tearing set."
3,Interesting ... but there are others,"I purchased this book for a university sociology course. Rose writes a book with very broad strokes. I guess it would be hard to analyze the entire cultural and ethnic make-up of the US in just a few hundred pages. Good for a person just starting out in sociology, but for more advanced learners and readers, this book will be disappointing."
5,Slayers Next: Sound Bible 3,"i love this Cd. I am a bit biased cause im a Slayers fan, the Cd is jammed with the background music plus a couple vocal songs. I can jus picture Lina as the Lord Of Nightmares as i lisen to this ^_^"
3,Mediocre CD.,"This CD was OK. I was really hoping for some of the catchy themes [vocal] that are usually seen in Slayers Next. Most of the music [16 tracks of it] was just background music from the series.Although good, these did not please me as well as some vocals by Megumi Hayashibara would have. I was expecting more or less more M.H. songs.Infact, there were NO vocals from the series. I was hoping the wonderful opening and closing would be on there. The only thing that came partially close was the ""Give a reason"" remix intitled ""Brave souls"" at the very end.. tho' it was in English, and that made it almost unbareable, seeing as how I've watched the subtitled tapes since the beginning.All-and-all it's got a nice cover, layout, and booklet inside, but it's not a Megumi Hayashibara CD, as the season is sung by pretty much just her, but instead it's just a musical enjoyment."
5,I love a parade,"For those that love jug band jubilees, Sheetz, Perry Como, ...-punches, Amish men, rodeo clowns and sing-a-longs...buy this book ...I am the King of Sweden"
4,works fine,"Got this years ago and it still seems to do what I need (as someone who does minimal photo editing) - brightening photos, cropping photos, a ""fix everything"" button. Crops better than the free Picasa, but otherwise not better."
3,Mediocre!,"Herdy Gerdy was a fun game, don't get me wrong, but it's far from perfect. First of all the gameplay consists of herding animals with various types of objects. The storyline actually isn't so bad and the music is great(different from any other game), but the game can get boring pretty fast. Its a bit to hard and that is what makes this game so frusturating. When I first got this game, I played it quite often and got about 33% done. But then I got stuck and, no matter how many times I'd try, I could not get past that part. I sometimes still will go back to playing that game but I have never been able to get past the part I got stuck at about 2 years ago. On the other hand, this game is a nice wholesome game that is suitable for younger kids."
3,Herdy Gerdy,"I'm not a ""gamer"" by any means, but this game was all right. I had to get something because I've already played the more popular adventure games. As almost everyone comments, the loading is very slow and the camera angles are messed up. Good game if you want to play for several hours. The pace is slow which is great for me, but I could see how most would get bored. Basically, if you just want to roam around and herd animals, this game is for you. If you actually want any action, look elsewhere."
5,Prairie Dog Exterminator,"Tried many different setups on a hunt and this one was so good I bought it and am using it with the big game swivel action shooting bench which I also tried out before buying. More expensive is NOT better. This is the combo! Both are light, easy to store, and very functional."
1,Cosmi=Spyware!,Do not buy this or any Cosmi or Starshine software. It installs Spyware on your computer and it will take an expert to get rid of it. Don't make the same mistake I did!
1,"Warning, watch will break...do not buy!","I received this as a xmas gift last year. Since then the minute hand has come disconnected TWICE. I sent it back for repair the first time, they sent it back, and about 1 month later the same problem occured. I have thrown it in the garbage now. Stay away. Cheaply made watch."
2,It's below averge,"This mic works, but it is a cheap one. It dosen't feel good after a while. There is always a static sound in your ear which get annoing after a while.I would suggest this a second mic only to use if your normal one brakes till you buy a better one."
4,Lovely resource on biblical women,"Our church did a bible study based on this book. I do love the way this book is layed out. Each chapter is a different women of the bible, and is assigned to a different author. The authors are Pastor's wives from Calvary Chapel's.I do love getting a different writing style, and theme to each chapter, it makes the read more interesting and go much faster.I can't give a reason for giving it only 4 stars. It was very good, and I enjoyed it very much, but I just didn't love it.I would suggest reading it though. It is insightful, and helps you get a little back ground on the life of a pastor's wives as well as the women of the bible chosen for each chapter."
5,beautiful experimental effort,"This album creates a beautiful soundscape, especially starting with Ageing Young Rebel (track 5). This track has a mysterious film-noir feel, coupled with a 1950's beat sensibility. It's sly and clever, and talks about how as we live our lives out, we lose touch with ourselves and just get 'normalized' by the society we live in. After track 5, the album delves more deeply into a kind of classical feel. It's very moody, velvety, and puts you into a kind of trance. Overall, this is just an excellent album!"
5,go bernie,"who knew that bernie williams had so much musical talent...as stated in a different review he's definately blessed.Bernie NYC loves you, Puerto Rico Loves you....next time get away from all the smooth and do more salsa!still you have amazing talen on the guitar and I'm surethis disc will suprise many...now when are the tour dates??"
4,Bernie Goes Boom!,"I didn't know what to think, but I knew I HAD TO HAVE this CD. As a HUGE Bernie fan, I always knew he was a talented musician. However, a whole CD's worth of music was entering into the great unknown (aka Bernie trying to throw a runner out at home!). With that said, I love it! The first few songs are fantastic. And the rest are quite good, despite their goofy titles (The Williams Kids, etc). This CD is a MUST HAVE for any Smooth Jazz or Yankee fan. You will not be disappointed!"
3,pretty Good,Being a New York Yankee Fan I was very Curious about this Project.I have Heard Bernie playing for a few years through Interviews&things.it has a Laid-Back Quality to it.it's not gonna knock you out but it has a nice vibe to it.some cool arrangements&the interesting thing will be how Serious Bernie gets with being a Artist after His Playing days are done.if Bernie enhances His Music like He has with His Play on the Field than He will Be A Winner in Music just as much as He is as a Player.
2,Nothing Special,"I heard ""Stranded on the Bridge"" on a local smooth jazz radio station and liked it. I was impressed with Bernie's guitar playing on this song. I thought I might be wrong about what I thought his CD would sound like. Unfortunately I bought the CD and its not very good. It is pretty whimpy even for smooth jazz! Many of the songs sound alike and Bernie's guitar playing is nothing to write home about. If it weren't for the above mentioned song the CD would be a complete dud! Maybe when Bernie retires and can spend more time developing his style and his sound will improve but for now pass on this CD unless your a big Yankee fan. It's just not very good."
1,Fair's fair,"If Yankees' fans can crowd the plate here and give this CD five stars simply because of Mr Williams' glove (probably not for his arm), it strikes me that turnabout is fair play. It would help if they listened to this music (smooth jazz that Kenny G would be proud of) but then justice has never been something one would catalog as a Yankees virtue."
5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!","Right off the bat (no pun intended), this collection merits a ""Six-Star"" review from me...I am not normally a listener of ""Smooth Jazz"" and such, and I am a tough sell when it comes to something I will listen to musically. Admittedly out of curiousity I gave the CD an honest listen on the Bernie Williams website expecting no more than just another novelty collection from a less than qualified celebrity tinkering with the effort.Well...I stand totally humbled, corrected, and most pleasantly surprised with this collection. This collection absolutely stands on its own merits musically, and compositionally. La Salsa En Mi is an infectious track that you will want to play over and over. I was touched by the tribute to Bernie's father on Para Don Berna. The other tracks speak for themselves and they are all strong.I heard one or two tracks on the radio awhile back and now after listening to this collection, I can not wait for the next collection!!!"
4,Quick muzzle for cats kept cat calm for haircut,This muzzle worked when we needed to trim a cat with very long hair which was matted in a few spots. No biting and cat was much calmer than when we attempted to trim the hair without the muzzle.
4,Good Story,"This is good sports story with an interesting off the court plot. This whole series is full of good lessons for kids that older sports fans might find corny. I had some of the original Hilton books as a boy and simply loved them. I read them so many times that I, however, feel betrayed by some of the revisions that the authors chose to make when they re-released the books. The changes sometimes create confusion and may cause inconsistencies in later books in the series. For example, one player who is 6-5 in the original version, is 6-10 in this revised version. No big deal in this story, but a later book in the series deals with the team's lack of a big man. If you are a Hilton fanatic, I think you will see what I mean. Still, this is one of the better stories in the series."
3,POKEMON CARD ALBUM,"THIS IS A NICE STORAGE ALBUM FOR THE POKEMON TRADING CARDS, MY SON COLLECTS THE CARDS AND PLAYS THE BATTLE GAME WITH HIS FRIENDS, AND THIS IS CONVIENANT TO TAKE ANYWHERE, COULD USE A FEW MORE POCKETS."
4,"Slightly disappointed, but glad I have it","This DVD is not quite what I thought it was going to be. If you are looking for some high quality highlights from the championship season, this DVD might leave you wanting much more. For example, that incredible throw that Cam made down the sideline 40 yards down field (AU fans know what I'm talking about) is not even on the DVD. Really, it's more about the locker room before and after each game. That's cool, some great footage that you probably wouldn't get anywhere else, but that's not really what I wanted. I wanted the highlights of the season to be the focal point, and you don't really get that."
5,Adorable!,"Shocked! It arrived one day earlier then scheduled! The box was huge, but in good shape! My husband put it together by himself, and had no problems! The outcome was amazing! A totally cool bed! Our son loved it! This was a hit ! Very sturdy! Buy it ! You can't go wrong!"
5,Pleasantly surprised!,"This bed exceeded every expectation I had! It's very sturdy, easy to assemble (full disclosure, we hired a professional), the tent is huge! The picture definitely does not do it justice. It's an extremely roomy tent. The slide is also much sturdier than I thought it would be! My husband is 6' 3"", weighs 210 and the slide holds him, no problem. Granted, he doesn't ""slide"" often.Bottom line, we all love the bed. We bought it for our 6 yr old but all of our kids love it and so do their friends of all ages. Even the older kids say ""this is such a cool bed"".If I could give it more stars, I would!"
1,unsure just yet,unsure just yet of this product considering seller shipped in unacceptable packaging and all hardware was missing and therefore I cannot assemble it (it arrived on Dec. 17 and it is now Jan. 5 and still no hardware). but looking at the pieces that did arrive safely it looks to be cheaply made with all the welding seams very visible and not looking to be very sturdy. hopefully for the price I paid I can get at least a few years use out of it for my son but its construction is very similar to a futon I purchased a few years back and it did not last long before all the welding broke loose
2,The House in the Woods,The storyline was way too simplistic and the acting was unrealistic. I feel this should be offered as a $0.00 item to view.
3,Better Than Amway but Too Long to Ship,"My mom who is in her early 60's have had sleep problems for many years. She started taking Nutrilite Black Cohosh and Soy which is 90 tablets for $26. We found this product and tried it out. It works just as well if not better. At 200 tablets for $15, you can't beat it.QUALITY - Works just as well as more expensive productsSHIPPING - Very very slow to ship via Amazon Prime. It took over 4 weeks!OVERALL - Will order again because of value."
4,Wonderful...but...,"This is great, but short. ""The Sounds of Christmas"" is the single greatest Christmas album ever, full of memory, Americana, joy, and life. It is put together as one continuous piece, not just as a collection of songs.This CD seems to have some parts of ""Sounds of Christmas"". The caroling here is wonderful, but it does make me long for the entire original. Until that becomes available, this is a must have."
4,Wherewith the Sounds of Christmas?,"This collection is just a sampling of ""The Sounds of Christmas"" and is a must have. As other reviewers have lamented: Why hasn't the whole album been cleaned up and released on cd."
3,Yet another vote for The Sounds of Christmas,"I grew up listening to Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians at Christmas and nothing beats ""The Sounds of Christmas"". I have found a compilation CD (unfortunately not available on Amazon - not sure why) that includes all tracks from the Sounds of Christmas and another LP that I was not familiar with - ""The Meaning of Christmas"" (both from the Capitol label). Have no idea regarding the quality, but I have my fingers crossed that my daughter will come to love this classic as much as I do."
2,Not the original,"This item was purchased, as it was an original recording I enjoyed as a child. However, when upgraded and released recently- some songs have been omitted and others shortened.If you are looking to purchase this for the original content, skip it."
3,"Still another person looking for ""The Sounds of Christmas""","I enjoy the music from the CD but still would love to have a CD of ""The Sounds of Christmas"" by Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians. I have a copy of the old vinyl record, and there's just nothing quite like it out there. Won't some smart record company exec see that this is reissued?"
5,Great,"Items as described on web, shipped out as quick as can beExpected. The discs are all in near perfect condition."
4,Good music - Poor label,"The songs are great, but they're not listed on the CD itself-only on the case. It's frustrating to put the disks in a multi-disk changer and not know what songs are on the disk."
5,It couldn't have been better,"Simply one of the best box sets ever, this masterpiece within musical history is not only a collection of great songs, it is also a statement: Elvis Prelsey IS American music in the 1950's. He is THE musical icon of the century, and this box set proves that he is still the most potent figure in pop culture."
1,What happened????????????,"I found this book to be completely poorly written. I read all of Mrs Lewis's books and loved them all but this one I just couldn't keep up with the story. One minutes the character wants to run then she wants to draw. The story was written with a beginning and end, there was nothing in the middle. You dont feel the anything but confusion."
4,Wonderfull,"The language of these novels is like a literary ice cream, I have never experienced such a delicious control of language. The subjects are sad, though. I guess, it is just a representation of the times when those were written."
4,a must for nabokov fans,"before i read this collection i divided it into the five nabokov ""dozen""..i read the dozen first fllowed by a roman beauty then tyrants destoyed, then details of a sunset, then remaining bottom of barrel. i enjoyed reading it this way, but u can also read it from first story to last and still enjoy it.. for some reason i divided it and would recommend you do so also..just go to back of book and look to see how it is split into ""dozens"" enjoy either way!!!!!!"
3,planters,they where as advertised and priced right for my needs. The only problem was the terra cotta one which was slightly damaged. It was apparently pushed down to far while in storge; so the corners are slightly white.
1,Star of David:Jewelry Days,I am still waiting for my item and that means that something is wrong. I have received anything elsethat I ordered that day. THis is disappointing. I revise this review now that I have received the pendant andeverything is fine.
5,great game,this is a great skate boarding game and it will last u a long time because if you finish one player there is loads of games to play in 2 player!
4,"Buy it, it's great, but just don't get too excited.","I was really excited when I heard Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 was coming out, and so I eagerly pre-ordered a copy of the game. When I played it, I noticed that it wasn't a great game. It was good, but they should have made it a lot better. The graphics had huge glitches and it really annoyed me, and although you could play it across the internet, it hasn't had much of improvement. It has had a bit, but not much. If I were you, I would definitely buy it if you don't have any of the previous two versions and if you have one or both of them, I still probably would but if you're not sure wheather to buy this or something else, I would MAYBE think about buying something else, but it is a great game, and if you have the chance to, I would buy it."
3,Why do they have to add trash...,"The game IS good, but it has a lot of unnessesary garbage (people peeing off buildings, bad language) that makes it not good for kids."
4,good game but not for that price,of course it's going to be a good game if it's one of the tony hawk games but now that its pretty old they need to reduce the price. its fun but not quite fun enough for 50 bucks.
5,Can't put it down...,"Warning: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is highly addicting. Ever since I bought this game I haven't been able to put it down. It was a little difficult to get used to at first, but now I'm pulling off 400,000-point combos with ease. The revert is a nice addition, and unlocking Darth Maul made the hours spent impressing those girls on the Cruise Ship worth it. The soundtrack is excellent (Xzibit's ""Paparazzi"" is one of my favorite rap songs ever), but it's too bad that almost none of them appear on the actual soundtrack. Definitely worth the money paid for it, but I need to start studying for my Series 7..."
5,great game,"once you get a hang of it the game is great. the engine is the same, but quicker. so you have to play a bit to be accustomed to it. the reverts make for great combo potential. the one thing that i'd have to say needs work is the soundtrack. theres a lot of music that isn't too good. but thats just my own prefrence. however, you can tell the game what to play and what to skip. so problem solved. if you were a fan of the first two, go for this. if you're new to the tony hawk world, give it a shot. also the create a skater/move list editor is a lot better. you unlock special slots instead of earning money. this way you can use any trick you want. that was a pain in thps2 and fixed now. the same goes for your stats and boards."
1,Stick with THPS2,"Of course being a fan of THPS1&2 I got THPS3......... big mistake. I should have known that scince tony hawk2 was MUCH harder(but still possible) that tony hawk1, that tony hawk3 would have been way too hard. I do not recommend this game to anyone!!! They have these stupid missions that will get you frustrated... and you will have the game on mute all the time because it has a soundtrack that nobody can enjoy AT ALL. I literally threw this game away, please take my words into consideration."
5,extremely good game,"has good gameplay and u can beat it with all 13 normal skaters,a created skater, and 8 secret skaters unlocked in career mode. u can open 3 bonus levels in addition to the 9 original levels in career mode. then there are 11 secret modes u may also unloc and if u still want more there is free skate and single session and then a 2player mode. it includes trick attack, graffiti, slap, horse, and free skate. then there will soon be an online mode so the fun never ends"
5,Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3,"THPS3 is slammin! You can do gnarlie moves with Tony Hawk, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell,Rune Glifberg,Eric Koston,Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera(from MTV fame),Rodney Mullen,Chad Muska,Andrew Reynolds,Geoff Rowley,Jamie Thomas,and last but not least, Elissa Steamer. Or if not you can create your own custom skater to do phat moves on. From my personal expierience this game is trippin' so you gotta try it. See ya on the flip side fellow video gamers!!!!"
3,Dissapointment...... but its in the bag,"TH3 is ok...The levels are mad gay like foundry, canada, cruiship,rio, airport. Who gives a crap about skating in the trees, or skating an a freakin airport..!!! OR a cruiship!!!... This game is for kidz...at least the last level could of been more street.. I guess i don't this game cuz i skate im not used to it... Neversoft proabbly wanted to make more money by putting kiddy sh*t in it...They should of stuck with the th2 evironemnt. The only two cool levels are los angels and skater island. Th2 is much better because they had real skate levels such as brooklyn banks,love park, and leap of faith. Thats what made th2 cool..thta is why im getting tony hawk2x for x box. because the graphics are nutz..... plus all the same levels from 1 and 2...plus 5 new ones. I guess the graphics are cool and the tricks look a hell of alot better but that about it... IN other words this game is not worth 52.99, but its in the bag. u might as well get tony hawk2x for Xbox.."
1,Show me something new,"I went to the E3 game show and played Hawk 3 for about an hour. It's the same game as the last two. Ride around and pick up the SKATE letters and the floaty video tapes. They really need to do something new with the game. If you don't add in a bunch of new gameplay and features (which they didn't), version 3 of anything gets stale...."
3,"Over-Hyped, but good","THPS3 is by all means a good game, but don't let it fool you into thinking that it's for everyone. Whereas SSX Tricky is fun, gorgeous and easy to pick up for almost any gamer, THPS is very hard, very soon. If you have little experience with THPS or any other Skateboarding/Snowboarding game, you may be in for a disappointing experience.If riding around a small (albeit well designed) area for hours trying to perform that one elusive trick sounds like fun, then buy away. Those of you looking for anything else will be disappointed since this game is about REPETITION. There are mini-tasks to complete each level, and some are very difficult, not to mention boring.This is a good game, but only for fans of the genre. It's a bit annoying to not be able to make it to the next level, only because you can't do one stupid trick. I pay for all the levels, I want all the levels!"
3,Same old THPS2,"I don't know what I was expecting when I ran out to the store and got THPS3 the day of it's release. Maybe I was hoping for great graphics like Madden 2002, or maybe the story-line of Metal Gear Solid. When I got home and popped in the game, I was disappointed from the first board all the way to the last level (which I got to in the same night). THPS3 builds on the exact same stuff that was packed into THPS2. In fact, I would call THPS3 an add-on pack (except for the online capability, which no one has yet). The graphics haven't changed much and neither have the moves. Secrets and hidden areas are far and few between...I found them to be more abundant on THPS2. Needless to say, after a day of playing this game, it's going back. Perhaps GTA3 will keep my interest longer, or maybe even fingernails on a chalkboard? Bottom line...if you're looking from an upgrade from THPS2 don't get your hopes up. If you're looking for more scenery for THPS3, this is the game to get."
5,PreOrder This Game Unless You Are ...!,"OK guys - let's review. Tony Hawk 1 - awesome. Tony Hawk 2 - even better. So my words of wisdom are: BUY THIS GAME!! If you are like me and have read previews and seen screenshots, then you probably have already reserved your copy. Plus, in this game they've thrown out lame Bob Burnquist and added Bam Margera - SWEET. If you have a PS2, this is a must buy."
