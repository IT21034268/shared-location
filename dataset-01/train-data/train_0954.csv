2,Bad taste. Doesn't dissolve.,"It tastes bad. Also it doesn't mix well in water, milk, or soy milk. It mixes the worst in soy milk. With all three, you are basically drinking clumps of powder, even if you use a shaker cup with a whisk ball in it and shake it forever. Props on it being vegan and low-calorie though."
3,GOOD,The taste is a bit chalky but not too bad if you blend in some fruit. I like the fact that it is 170 calories a scoop which is 50 calories lower than whey.
2,Ok Product,The Taste is pretty bad and they give you so little for a lot of money. If you want a better product in both price and taste try Optimum Nutrition Whey Powder.
2,Not for lactose intolerant,"I purchased this product because it said it was lactose free, but when I tried it, guess what--intestinal upset and diarrhea!"
5,sweet,this has to be the best series that i have ever read. anita blake is this kick ass chick who has her own rules and answers to no one. she is short and sexy and legally get to kill vampires and anything that goes bump in the nite. i love dangerous women as main characters and this is the best ive ever read you will not be disappointed....
5,Excellent!,"I havnet read the series, my friends recommended ""The Lunatic Cafe"" to me so i started reading and i LOVED it! It's face paced, intriguing and a great read! This may be the best book I've read in a long time! I cant wait to read more by Laurell K. Hamilton in the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter Novels and her other works! :)"
5,Excellent,"This book gives you a good look at the were-community. Werewolves, wereleopards, wererats. We've met them before but now we see how the pack works and the power-plays that matter. Like the vampires, in so many ways, these communities live within their own separate set of rules that are above the rules of the outside world. Anita gets sucked into helping the werewolves, and at the same time deals with her two romances...Richard, who has her heart, and Jena-Claude, who she has to be with as well. Also, you meet Edward for real, Anita's vampire-hating, bounty hunter friend. He's fun. This fourth installment definitely moves the series along and helps more firmly establish Hamilton's world."
2,I wouldn't recommed this series...,"Sorry, but I didn't like it. I think I spent an hour on the whole book.."
2,As always problematic,"Marcus had potential as a arch-enemy but he was given such short shrift here that when he's subsequently killed it doesn't hold the impact one might expect. Again the big whoopdedoo is Anita being raped. Which keeps as a recurring theme throughout all of the books. It tends to wear thin after awhile.As with my other thoughts on the Anita Blake series some are better than others but only marginally. I keep hope alive for this series, for this character but each book is a hit or far miss."
3,Too many non-sex sex scenes.,"Shapeshifters are being killed, Anita Blake is trapped between Richard, a werewolf, and Jean-Claude, the Master Vampire, and Edward has shown up. Times should be rocking but the book is pretty boring. Most of the time Blake seems to be more worried about her love life. There are lots of scenes where sex almost happens but does not. Page after page of hot, sexy, non-nothing action. Is the author in heat?Frankly, I find the main male characters more interesting than Anita Blake. I want to know more about Richard, Jean-Claude and Edward than the main female character. Why? Because she is boring me. There is NO action, no sex, few fight scenes and she STILL seems to be getting her butt kicked a lot. Also I felt there were a few loose ends designed JUST to force you to pick up the next book. Shame on YOU.Buy this is you want romance. If you want vampires, horror, plot go to Anne Rice, Tanya Huff or P.N. Elrod. Oh, this review is going to get so edited."
4,Another good addition to the series...,"I enjoyed reading this addition to the series. The plot was good, and action-packed, and the author did a great job building the tension between Anita and her two love interests. The world-building was as good as usual, too. The only flaw that was serious enough (in my opinion) to affect my review is that I didn't buy into the love between Anita and Richard as much as I wish I could have. It seemed that they didn't have enough experiences together and affection for each other for the relationship to progress as deeply and as quickly as it did. Even with less page-time, I bought into Anita's love for Jean-Claude much more easily. I don't know why, but I did, and the ""flatness"" of Anita and Richard's relationship impacted my enjoyment of the story somewhat. Other than that, this was well worth the read and I look forward to reading the next book in the series."
3,I love Anita Blake,"Overall I really enjoyed this story even though I only gave it 3 stars. In general I liked where the storyline was going; i absolutely love Richard, Anita's main love interest. Even though their relationship has been having up and downs, their conflicts stay very true to the character of Anita Blake. Her problems with dating Richard reflect how her character views the world. However, I'm very excited to see where their storyline goes!I guess i didn't rate this 4 stars because I didn't feel the story to be a real page turner until the last 25% of the book, but i'll tell you those last few chapters are addictive and fantastic!!!Still a good read, but I m being a little harsher with these books considering it is a 21 book series. So don't get me wrong, I <3 Anita Blake!!Still a must read :]"
4,"Pretty ""Damned"" Good if I do say so myself","Hey, loved it. It and the sequels. Pick it up, read it, buy more. I said read it. now. Stop reading this, and read the book. It's more interesting. Trust me. Don't you trust me? You should, you know."
2,The Lunatic Cafe,"I sent this to a friend, she like it. However, I was xpecting her to receive the book and not the graphic novel. This product should be labeled better."
5,Great Series Gets Better,"Lycenthropes are going missing...Anita is on the hunt.Anita Blake is getting better and better. I didn't like Jean Claude in this one though...he was too cold and mean. Still, Anita is getting more developed as a character and I'm not really caring about her relationships with these people. The whole always do what's right thing, even at her own peril, was getting on my nerves and in this novel she does more of what needs to be done."
2,Too Many Problems,"I have enjoyed the Anita Blake series so far, but I was disappointed this time around. Anita's character was inconsistent with her attitude between Richard and Jean-Claude. Anita would NEVER allow Jean-Claude to interfere with her personal life and give in to his ridiculous proposal to date her against her will when she's so in love with Richard. As for the thrown-together mystery involving the murders of lycanthropes, I couldn't believe the author expected her readers to believe that within the same week, three seperate killers without knowing each other were killing them off. Sorry, this is just not credible. Not to mention the obvious tip-off when the ""bad guys"" show up. I'm starting to really be annoyed by Anita's attitude. She can't stop complaining about her life, no matter how good she has it. She is becoming unlikable as a character... and that's not a good sign."
5,the best necro around,Anita Blake series is the best series i have ever read. once you get started you have a hard time putting it down..
3,Starting to slip,"I've been reading LKH's work when she was placing short stories in the Sword and Sorceress anthologies. I like her writing style, her approach to storytelling, and her use of sub-plots.That said, I'm starting to lose faith in the Anita Blake series. The first novel caught me because it was a struggle for Anita to kill vampires, it was dangerous, life-threatening work. She was one woman--and not an Amazon. She could be made vulnerable, and often was.Things have started to go downhill, though. More and more 'hidden, potent powers' are springing up in Anita. I won't spoil the books for those who haven't read them, but it's beginning to put a strain on my sense of disbelief. I haven't considered any of the villans since the first two books to be actually threatening, and the number of supernatural allies is becoming absurd.I hope Ms. Hamilton stabilizes Wonder Woman, the Vampire Slayer pretty soon. It's a shame to see a once-good series slip so far."
3,"Fast Shipping, Product not as Described!","I ordered a new book. The book I received showed signs of the book being read. The cover is not the same either. Fast shipping, however the book is in good condition, but I am one of those people who like having a new book for personal reasons."
4,Good Read,"So I needed a Vamp fix after Black Dagger Brotherhood (best series I have read so far action, drama, passion, romance ...the works). So I decided to check out Anita Blake, it was not what I expected there has been no romance, or steamy scenes of any kind so far Im on book 3....but I AM NOT disappointed the action and drama is fast paced. I love a cycnical kick @$$ chick. I bought the first 11 and intend to read them all. It's a great series, very gory, gritty, and abit scary I LUV it;)Hard to stop reading once you start! I just wish she would get with Jean-Claude already... besides Richard is too good for her:)"
5,Werecreatures are missing,"Anita Blake is dating Richard, a werewolf. His pack leader wants her to find out what happened to 7 missing shape shifters. Jean Claude, the vampire, is not happy about her new relationship. Gretchen is in love with Jean Claude, and wants to kill Anita. Sounds convoluted, but this is actually a very exciting and gripping book. I couldn't put it down until I finished and was tempted to start again right away."
4,Okay...,"Great book. Good plot. But why don't I like Anita's boyfriend at all. Richard is not a very likable character for me. I think Jean-Claude is much better. He's the kind of character that you keep hoping he'd pop up. But Richard, ughh. Even the character Phillip (from the 1st book) is more likable than Richard. Hamilton introduced so many new characters and breeds into this one that it's too confusing and boring somewhat."
5,laurell k. hamilton's books are the greatest ive ever read,"i've read a lot of books, and i must say that ms. hamilton's are the best!! they have everyone living side by side, and it makes for some interesting story lines. she has the good the bad and the not so smart. i love anita's personality, and am always waiting for the next book to come out."
1,A Travesty from start to finish,"Famously, Pierre Boulez suggested that all opera houses should be blown up. There is not one bar on this recording to indicate any change of perspective (""change of heart"" is evidently not an appropriate expression here). Bluntly and simply, Boulez loathes drama, and doesn't seem to care much for music, either. If you like your music drama joyless, pedantic, and frequently perverse, this is the one for you. A decent cast and band gone to waste on the altar of anti-bourgeois condescension."
4,"""The Art of War"" presents an pessimistic view of mankind.",Machiavelli talks about the best way to achieve your own self-interest and material gain
1,Self-loving blowhard,I couldn't finish it. I needed something to help me with a DANTES exam on Russia...this isn't it. The author is too busy selling his profession and trying to make us believe how important he is than actually giving out useful information. This is neither textbook or recreational reading. Classify it as pompous blowhard crap.
1,Disappointment,"This was the only book that I have bought through Amazon that has disappointed me. If I had leaved through this book at a bookstore, I would never have purchased it. The layout ideas are so average that one sees them everywhere, on the web, in friends scrapbooks. Not in a layout idea book. The pictures in the layouts are sometimes haphazardly put out. The format is small so that one has to squint to see the details. And I can get almost all the ideas from my Creative Memory Idea Books. There are no explanations for the beginner, no step by step instructions. And it is too simple for those who want to take their work to the next level. However, these might be just the qualities that a lot of people are looking for."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this book for my elaborate scrapbooking library.I was amazed at it's simplicity. These layouts are nothing more than poor imitations of Creative Memory ideas. The same layouts are used throughout the book with different pictures. They are nothing more than a couple of women's actual pages - mistakes and all. You would think that the editors would request that Minnie Mouse be spelled correctly and that the artists would want to include only the best pages that they could.Very poor skills here, my worst pages look better than their best. Pictures are tilted (not on purpose), lettering is awful, and I'm amazed that this book even made it to print.If you want some good ideas, don't waste your money on this book. Look around instead: you can find a much bigger bang for your buck with a magazine, or if you like the CM style, just get one of the 'professional' idea books that they publish."
1,Just Pictures,Good layout ideas but only pictures shown. If you only want to see pages and pages of scrapbook layouts...then this is the book for you. If you're like me and need to see a bit more detail or instructions.....don't buy this book.
5,over and over,i can't stop listening to this cd. it's just really really good. there really isn't that much else to say. honestly the strongest debut i've ever heard.
4,"Not the unicorns, But it will do.","I don't know if anyone else is like me, But often times I just go to the Itunes music store and do a search on Unicorns, just to see what other Unicorn fans are listening to. Tapes n' Tapes came up one of the times I did a search, So I put down the 10 bucks to give it a listen.At first I was expecting something like the Unicorns, but I got something totally different. Tapes n' Tapes have a unique sound to them that should be checked out. They have have some really strong singles on here, such as ""Insistor"" and ""10 Gallon Ascots"", but I really wouldn't say it's that strong of a album. I'm not saying there is only two good songs on this album, because it's all really nice, but those are the two that stick out to me.If i were you, I would give those two songs a listen and if you don't like those, don't buy the album. If you do though, consider it a delightful new piece to your music collection!"
3,Do you believe the hype?,"Anthemic and cavernous guitar rock from the uber-indie Tapes 'n' Tapes. Nothing terribly original, here. Heavily informed by the likes of British Sea Power, the Arcade Fire, Spoon, the Walkmen, Interpol, and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Tapes 'n' Tapes craft tastefully angular and unobtrusively moody toe tapping tunes that are equal parts melodic and energetic. Kind of generic and more than a little derivative, the Loon is nevertheless a decently listenable record, and sure to make every indie kid jump for joy.For what it's worth, I hated it."
2,Fantastic new group of the current economic slump,"This little tiny sick band just couldn't cut it. If you need to read Pitchfork to determine what bands to listen to, you probably need some help anyway. Stick with the Femmes, the Pixies, and the Talking Heads. This is derivative. Fun, but derivative. Anyone who says otherwise probably needs Pitchfork to tell him what to listen to. And Pitchfork just ain't all that."
2,What is going on?,"Perhaps it's me, but I cannot follow this story. This author has garnered many awards for her novels and the subject of this novel is extremely appealing. However, her writing style made it impossible for me to follow her narrative. I think Hillary Mantel is one of those authors whom you either love or don't. This was the third book by her that I have read and I fear I fall into the latter category."
2,this product does not come like the photos that present/display in the page Web,"from the first moment that installs the video card in my computer this I do not present/display image. I believe that this product can that it does not fulfill the espectativas of many people, in my place cannot prove it so that I never work myself"
3,a little boring,"very useful for exercising study...and all men are hansome ( all nudity ) but sometimes same sequence are repeated, so a little boring. Anyway, very sexy guys show all to you. If you watch all this tape at one time, you must have great endurance.^^ If you are tired of hard-core gay film or want to make your body built-up, I highly recomand this tape"
4,"Don""t buy the group","When you buy one, Amazon also suggest others in this grouping. Not worth it. A lot of the techniques described and shown in this are the same or a carry over from Nude Stretching. Not to say that is bad because if you buy one you get the benefit of what is in both."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I was expecting a legit workout video instead it's more like a cheap softcore porn without the sex. Plus the guys are all from the 80s, don't waste your money."
5,Very cute story,My husband comes from a very Irish family so we decided we must have this for our collection. It's a very cute story and we all enjoyed reading it on Christmas Eve. It's a new family tradition!
5,A Wee Bit of the Irish for Christmas,"I bought this book for my daughter Bridget and it is a great read. A very nice take on the classic. Whether you are of Irish heritage or not... all will enjoy. It is quite humorous for adults and children alike. I enjoy reading this to my daughter around Christmas time and of course on Christmas Eve. As the Irish say, ""Tis good craic(fun)""! We love it!"
3,"Degung-sabilulungan: Sundanese Music of West Java, Vol. 2",This vol. 2 is even better than vol. 1. The music is easy to listen to and very soothing. A must have!
2,overpriced and boring!,"I love Terry Laughlin's method (although he does spend so much time trying to sell it to you that you start to become suspicious...), and I keep all the beautiful articles (with fantastic color photographs) he wrote for Fitness Swimmer, but this book in a joke. Make no mistake, it would be a fine pamphlet to have if it sold for 5 bucks, but this booklet is 25 dollars! I was happy to pay this much for what I thought would be the ultimate book on swimming, an aquatic version of ""The Triathlete's Training Bible"", and what I got was something that looked like bad photocopies of the Fitness Swimmer articles. This was a very bad marketing move for Laughlin, as far as I am concerned: I really felt he had no respect for the reader, and was just after the money. The content of the book will be no news if you ever read Fitness Swimmer. Save some cash, get some back issues of the magazine, and head to the pool."
3,"Good book, but there is a better.","This is a good book for the beginning swimmer, but I would recommend ""Total Immersion: The Revolutionary Way To Swim Better, Faster, and Easier"" over this book. It is by the same author, Terry Laughlin."
4,Nice product - NOT water proof/resistant,"Used on my trip to the beach and works very well. Material was good quality. Comes with nice straps and they were a very good length. Folds up nicely for storage.One Note... Look at the box, as it lists weather restistant. Dirt,Wind and Sun only. There is nothing water resistant about this bag. So if planning to take a trip, stay out of the rain. I loaded mine up and then hit a two hour storm. Corners were soaked from the kick up from the wheels. Had to air dry everything once arriving to my destination."
2,dissappointed,I should have listened to the other reviews in regards to the waterproofing or lack thereof of this product. Took a trip from Florida to new York unfortunately it rained the whole trip back. Unfortunately all my luggage was soaked and some clothing was ruined.This is an excellent product on dry days. It managed to hold 4 carry on size suitcases securely. Spend a little more and get something water proof not water resistant
5,Great for teachers and students,"I purchased this book to expand my teaching arsenal. It proved to be so well organized and comprehensive, I recommended it to several of my more advanced students.I encourage any teacher who is looking for a good all around reference book to check this one out."
5,Why we ordered,We watched this when we were living in UK and enjoyed the humor then as we do now. Two words
4,Good book for the professional,"This book is a great reference for professional staff who work on a brain injury treatment unit ... IF they have a position which allows some ability to impact on other staff. The behavior management suggestions are practical and helpful. Again, however, they require the ability to gain cooperation from all the staff, so this book will not be terribly helpful to a clinical staff person looking for practical suggestions for managing behaviors of specific individuals in their daily work."
5,three words A-Maze--ING!,"I am a true believer in magic. When I sent for this set, I had no idea how much it would transform my life. I have been afflicted my whole life with a painful stutter, and it has made me very shy and afraid to stand out in a crowd. My speech therapist advised me to learn a few sleght of hand tricks as a social ice-breaker, as I must attend a wedding this October and be introduced to many new people. Well. not only have i learned some tricks, but have achieved a confidence level I could only dream of before!! I have ""performed""in front of several (small) groups so far, and have even added jokes!! With nary a stutter! Tim Noonan is a saint!"
1,"Wow, grating and worthless","This band has something to offer all of you, a headache. The truly ""rock"" songs, like pandamoranda have terrible screaching noises in the background like a highschool band who cannot keep their mikes from the the speakers. These harder songs are also very repetitive. The slower, sad songs, like candy are incredibly boring, and really just uninspired. A man sings on the piano, and that is pretty much it. It goes from low rock, to even lower piano/singing junk. Do NOT buy this, unless you just want to fit in with the other 10 poeple who said that this album ""Rocked"". Please use your hearts, not your stupid popularity influenced minds to see that this album totally sucks."
3,Fascinating,"I saw these guys live in Maryville, Mo. The vocal delivery is simply unique, although it does remind me somewhat of Filter, a similarity that I also heard on many of the heavier songs (especially Pandamoranda, which felt it could be lifted straight off Filter's Short Bus) but Lovedrug dips down into soft, acoustic performances with an ease and beauty of few bands. A certain gothic sensibility pervades the whole thing, as it drips with this cool, strange blackness.So, I like their sound, and the lyrics have a compelling, Radiohead like weirdness to them, but in actual technical abilities I can't rate them in the top ten. Also, for me they got a little bit old once the novelty wore off."
5,A very distinct sound,"I listen to a vast majority of music ranging from very heavy to very light. Some new and much old. I can usually judge a band very well. These guys are really putting music back into music and saving us from the commercial trash we're surrounded with these days. Buy a copy, take a listen, you will be most satisfied."
4,if you like sunny day real estate you'll like this,"although at least three of these songs have already been released on EPs, the album was still satisfying. lovedrug is probably going to be most often compared to sunny day, esp. with the high-pitched vocals, but in my opinion they're definitely better. more melodic, more variety in the song structures, and overall a catchier sound with more hooks. some of the piano-based tracks are a little dull and the lyrics tend to be indulgent, but there are more than a few standout and definitely rockin' tracks, such as: in red, blackout, rocknroll, and candy. lookin' forward to the next one."
4,Simply soothing.,"Quite possibly one of the better bands out there, and Pretend You're Alive certainly doesn't disappoint. One song after another will get you hooked (get it? Drug? Hooked. Awful pun.) and it is certainly one of the most talked about Indie albums out there in recent years, and with good reason.So listen to it and be elitist with the rest of them too. You will have plenty of reasons to be ""too good"" for the rest of them if you own this album."
5,buena grabación,"...En cuanto a la grabación Domingo canta y hace un buen Don Carlos, Ricciarelli es una hermosa Elisabetta de Valois aunque en el primer acto su voz es potente y como lo exige el papel sobrepasa a los coros, en en 5 acto necesita un poco más de agilidad y fuerza vocal comparado con otras (Scotto, Freni, Jurinac y M. Price) Velentini es una buena Eboli aunque le hace falta más extensión en contraste con Barbieri, Cossotto, B Grace, Verett y Dolora zajick quien al cantar O Don Fatale en en Teatro Teresa Carreño de Caracas (Venezuela) fue ovasionada apoteósicamente, el resto del elenco Raimondi, Nucci son indescriptibles."
4,All Israel Dances Toward The Tabernacle,"I pick this book up at a conference, it is easy to understand, and sets a bibical stand point on dance as worship. There are not to many books out there on dance, I suggest you add this your collection"
1,HOW DID THIS GET PUBLISHED?,This book of monologues is for those actors who wish to exachange pointless dialogue with one another while the audience naps.
2,Disappointed,"My main disappointed with this vinyl set is the distant sound. The singers appear, if not off stage, near rhe back of the stage. Consequently, this affects the listening volume as well as presence. Perhaps this is not a concern with sound systems that are weak on depth. Any commenst would be appreciated."
3,Windup Alarm Clock,"The clock is what I thought it would be. The alarm has good, loud sound, however, it is very difficult to wind up. For such a large clock, everything is set too close together. I've had wind-ups before, but this one gives the impression of being made with cheap materials. Edges not as nice and smooth. But it serves its purpose."
3,Not as advertised,"The ring on this thing could wake a dead horse, but if you need the time in the dark, you'll have to turn on a light. The hand and dots DO NOT luminate as advertised and this was a big disappointment since it is at least 50% of the reason I chose it. It doesn't ""beep"" either as written on the side of the box."
2,transaction not complete,"I had very good service from amazon. My product arrived in a timely manner. However, when I gave it to my Dad for his birthday...we discovered that the wind-up for the alarm did not work. I returned the product to Maxi-aids. I have not received any acknowledgement from them at this time. It has been a month now since I ordered the product and I still do not have a working alarm clock or any response from Maxi-aids."
1,NOT A Wind-Up & DOA,"The ""Most Helpful Critical Review"" is of a wind-up alarm clock. My bad, I failed to read the product description (as the customer reveiws are usually more accurate)so was surprised it takes one AA battery. Oh well ...However, out-of-the box with a new AA battery the alarm fails to work.(Five stars for the nice brassy appearance.)Luckily, it's easy to return ..."
4,Good Documentary,"I am enlisting after college and will possibly be attending OCS. After watching this set, I felt attached to the recruits. It goes in depth to show you what Marine Corps boot camp is all about. I will definitely be more ready after watching. This is my second DVD set of this to own."
4,Accurate portrayal,"This is a very sobering and proud look at what goes into becoming a US Marine. It is earned- never given. My husband was actually in the original Making Marines that you can buy off the Discovery Channel store. It was unique for him since, while going through boot camp at Parris Island, was when America was attacked on Sept 11th. It was a unique experience and it is a little celebrity for him that you can see this tall skinny hairless thing going through becoming a Marine. Later, he ended up going over there as a Marine and, coming from a family of military folks but no one of our generation willing to join the Marines, it is a different branch and dvds like this really helps to give a good look at what happens and what is involved. A word to the wise: he said when the cameras were not there or turned off they still got hit. But, it is a part of the training to be America's attack dogs."
4,Numbers Disappear,"Great watch except for one thing. The numbers around the bevel have been painted on with some cheap white paint that begin to disappear w/in a few days of use rendering the ""favoured end of the starting line"" feature/calculator completely useless. You quickly start to get just a black band around the edge.I've coated the remaining numbers with clear nail polish to see if it does anything but its really annoying to see such a cheap piece of work on what is otherwise a great watch."
2,Poor manual,"The M3 is probably a great watch, but the manual is so minimalist that I'll prob never figure it out. It really needs a menu hierarchy/map so you can figure out where to find the various functions."
1,Audio Disaster,"With 1.2 Kilowatts of subwoofer enhanced audio power I was anxious to hear the melody called ""Charmaine"" brilliantly performed by Mantovani. I recently heard this piece on the movie ""Green Mile"", and it brought back memories of hearing it on mom's magnificent Magnavox.Apparently the Madacy company didn't grease the palms of the liscensing agents sufficiently. The bottom end was completely shaved off, and the mid range grossly exaggerated! I couldn't bear to hear any more of this attempt at sound, so this review refers only ""Charmaine"""
1,The WORST Of The Mantovani Orchestra.CD.,"The sound engineers who produced this CD should undergo a hearing analysis and then face the firing squad for insulting the listening fans of Mantovani.The worst sound produced even in the best DSP stereo system.The sounds are aweful they are muffled..even in maximum volume control.I would rate this CD...ZERO...unfortunately there's none...There's still hope for this CD...you can install a small electronic clock and make it as a CD clock for your home,office or living room."
5,Perect siging by Gothic Voices,"I must thank the Rough Guide for recommending this CD or troubadour songs and religious music perfectly sung by Gothic Voices. The troubadours during the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries became the first composers to compose secular music using their own language: French instead of Latin. They had a profound impact on cultural life singing about love and court matters until their influence waned during the Crusades.Some of my personal favorites were the songs En cest, the Credo and the song by Prince ""Plaisance"" which is one of the most beautiful songs of the period.Highly recommended for anyone interested in Early Music.Please excuse any typos I have a neurologic disease."
4,"O.K....but,.......","I was born in Biloxi, MS, lived there 19 years, moved to Mobile, AL and lived there for 7 years, then moved to Atlanta, GA and lived there for 12 years...I guess you could say I'm a southerner.There are many places in the South, and the narrative and imagery just depict a narrow view of southern places and religions. If you're reading this and you've never been to the South...please don't use this film as a travel log or as your major source of information.The musicians and their music make the film -"
1,...just a total let down.,"honestly, this movie is awful to sit through because of Jim White and his ridiculous, meaningless philosophy of the South. he is an apsolute bore...unless, perhaps, you get a laugh out of it all. there are other reviews here that explain this film's faults in better detail and I needn't repeat them all (you know, paid actor sort of grumblings)...I will say this documentary only shows you one perspective, WHITE'S and he seems like a real silly square to me. there are some nice visuals, I'll admit that, but just drive through Southern states yourself and be spared the dim-witted ramblings of this self-serving ""guide"" Jim White. oh and some of the music is pretty good, a lot of it just sucks."
4,"""The South Is An Atmosphere ~ Will You Know It When You See It?""","""Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus (`03) is a somewhat pretentious, but unquestionably surreal and mystical journey through the back roads, bars, prisons, churches and assorted marginalized communities of the American South. The striking, bayou landscape blends beautifully with the haunting soundtrack making your viewing a truly memorable and disturbing experience. By the time the film comes to an end you will surely be in agreement with the films narrator and guide Jim White, ""the South is an atmosphere.""Postscript: What really makes this film worth owning is the intoxicating soundtrack featuring the music of 'The Hansome Family'. It's unlike anything I've ever heard before!"
4,Excellent Packaging,"This is a very clear, sharp guide that addresses a common on-the-job problem -- although many can follow, few can lead, and even fewer know they can lead when they land the leadership position.What impressed me most was the excellent packaging of the idea -- using the seven skills (with the acronym), the lists of questions, the step-by-step plans, the boxed tips, and the self assessments to help reinforce learning and retention.The sample dialogues were particularly helpful. Even when you give people specific instructions, seeing them acted out successfully by others can be exactly what's needed for complete understanding."
3,The 7 Habits of Effective Team Leaders,Move over Stephen Covey. Here come seven more habits for team leaders to be coaches. A good treatment. This one is very focused and practical. Not nearly as wordy and flowery as Covey. It's not really a duplication of Covey because it is focused on coaching skills in particular.
4,Good dialogues with the executive coach,"To illustrate each of the seven coaching skills, there is a sample coaching session which shows how a coach would hone in and discuss each skill area. Very artfully done. The authors are all executive coaches and you can tell they are skilled practioners instead of academics."
4,A Good Read -- No Nonsense,"A practical, yet entertaining read. Boils down a complex subject into something I can use. The cartoons were good. I'd reccommend it to anyone in the coaching business."
4,Good Book to Introduce 360 Feedback,"This book is a good introduction to the idea of 360 feedback, as well as coaching skills. Each of the 7 skill areas have about 10 behaviors or competencies that go with them. And the self assessment makes a good first checklist of skills in a 360 assessment.All of the managers in our company will go through a 360 feedback process this year for the first time. I'm going to give this book them to warm them up to the idea."
5,Love this CD!,"High quality recording, as usual from DG! This recording sounds very energetic compared to another Bach CD set of piano concertos in my collection."
5,Season 1 of Fun!,"Slayers is an Anime Classic! Lina is one of the best charcthers ever and her supporting cast is just as cool! It's funny, cute, and I love how it never takes itself too seriously. Love the Dub cast! And Slayers is just FUN! Now on too season 2! ^_^"
1,No Japanese Audio = WORTHLESS!,This is not a VHS cassette. It is a video disc. You are not stuck with a single audio track. Everything is better in the original language. Especially when the so-called voice talent used to dub this series into English is only slightly less annoying to listen to than a set of silverware being chewed up in a garbage disposal. Adding the Japanese audio track wouldn't dissuade anyone from buying this but not including it is a slap in the face. A smidgen of extra effort and Funimation might have produced something that people who are actually passionate about Japanese media might have purchased. Guess they dodged the profit bullet there! Another in along line of dismal failures from Funimation. It will cost a little more but when I buy this on Blu-ray from Japan but it will feel good knowing I won't have to give 1 shiny silver yen to the lazy slobs at Funimation.
5,better than private therapy,"This phenomenal work of art (psychology) in this science was tough to read through as a sexually abused (when a toddler) surviver. However, it was well worth it to review and process even more as a 60 year old what I had spent years of 12 Step and other group work weeding through. What is so wonderful is this kind kindred soul, P. Perterson with whom one (reader) develops a bond with because she has not merely studied the topics she writes about, but has lived them and seems sincerely earger to serve humanity with spiritual and practical wisdom. Thank you for facilitating more life saving change within my real self!"
3,Good,"The recording is overall excellent; the chours, Wiener Singverein does not sound ""excellent"". I prefer the 1962 or the 1984 recordings of Karajan.I would recommend Claudio Abbado's or Sir Georg Solti (1974)'s recordings of the 9th."
3,"If you like south park, it's worth watching once","I often deny the fact that I actually like South Park, mostly because guys tend to think it's weird for a girl to like it, but I do. And South Park Imaginationland is worth watching once. It is no where near as good as the series, but for true fans of the show, it is definitely worth watching."
5,Excellent Book,"I bought this book at a bookstore in Vancouver, B.C. this past November. I am looking to get a tattoo of one of these designs. I just finished reading this and it went way beyond my expectations of what I was going to learn about this art. The photos and illustrations are amazing as well as the text on the history. I feel even better about getting my tattoo now, because I really have the knowledge behind the design."
5,Bianchi 105 Minimalist IS A KEEPER,"I purchased the 105 minimalist for a SW 9mm I had purchased. This has become my, go to, holster for this handgun."
2,Disturbing Fiction,"This book is fiction, not a memoir. The author writes that her mother was in a hurry to marry her Dad because she was already 30. By the time Mary's older sister is 9, Mary's grandmother moves in with the family. Mary Karr writes: ""It must be terrible to have cancer at age 50"". So, the grandmother was 50 at the time and the mother was (at least) 30+9+9 months = 40 years old? I don't think so!I liked the way Mary Karr tells the story - for a while. I really enjoyed the tall tales her father made up in the first third or so of the book. After the second sexual abuse scene, however, I had thoroughly enough of the despicable characters. No need reading somebody else's nightmares stated as a fact."
2,Don't see what the big deal is about this book,"When a book has tons of good reviews and an award to boot, I have high expectations. Usually those expectations are not met. Such is the case with ""The Liar's Club"". Mary Karr just goes on and on and on.....and to be honest her parents weren't bad people. So things weren't conventional in that house? The parents did show love to Mary and her sister.I couldn't get 1/2 way through this book because it wasn't holding my interest. ""The Glass Castle"" by Jeanette Walls is much better. Her upbringing was more messed up and interesting than Mary Karr's."
2,i won't lie to you,"bo-ring. i just didn't like the book. granted, some of the subject matter was interesting, as is true in almost every book, but there was something this particular one i found extremely dull. it never went below the surface, and it feels to me that although she's talking about all this deep and profound stuff - family chaos, alcoholism, mental illness - she doesn't really have much perspective on it, and is still herself deeply rooted in her own family system (look at the people she dedicates the book to!). i've found SO MANY better books than this one - what a bore!"
2,Very Difficult to Finish,"I found this book to be difficult to read and finish, not necessarily for the subject matter, but her style of writing just doesn't flow naturally to me (felt the same about ""Lit"" which I actually read before ""The Liars' Club""). And reading about the sexual act forced upon the author when she was 8 years old made me feel sickened and dirty. I definitely do not recommend this book. As others have written, ""The Glass Castle"" is a much, much better book in this genre."
4,Good book,"The reviews were incredible on this book and it was very good. First person account of someone's actual life. I did like it but it was slow going to read. There are two more books in the series and I think I will read them, but not right away. Have to let this one soak in first."
2,I did not enjoy this book- it was torture to finish it,It is not well written and just boring and no need to have ever been written in my opinion. I was an English teacher and an avid reader and why this was so well recieved is beyond my imagination.= well look reality TV is loved by the common denominater in this Country- I rest my case
5,Splendid read!,Thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a wonderful tale of a very disfunctional family and makes me feel so much better about my own family of origin. Told in a humurous but heartfelt manner; I hated it to end.
2,Very disappointing,"I read this book because The Glass Castle is one of my favorite books, and I thought this book would be similar. While the subject matter is somewhat similar, the writing style is extremely different. I found Ms. Karr's pace to be very slow and choppy. She would provide detailed descriptions about things that did nothing to advance the story. She would start talking about a particular incident, and then would get off on a tangent. The subject matter had a lot of potentional, but I just didn't care for her style of writing and thought the book was boring overall."
2,A bit boring,"I really don't know what all the good reviews are about on this book. I really enjoy reading memoirs, but I just couln't get into this one. For the most part I thought the stories were not very interesting. I kept putting the book down, and then kept convincing myself that it must get better if so many people rated it with five stars. I just put it down once again, and I'm about 80% finished at this point and it hasn't gotten very interesting. I'm disappointed...I hoped to order the other 2 to take on vacation with me, but probably won't bother."
4,Great Writing,"As a child, one often thinks ""this kind of stuff doesn't happen in other people's families!"" Mary Karr has written a wonderful memoir that lets you know it certainly does ! It has a certain power that makes the reader know life is really not ""The Brady Bunch"" for a whole lot of us. It's written with humor, emotion, and raw honesty about how getting through a tumultuous childhood and rising above it is truly a blessing. Through all the madness and turmoil, this is a family who loves each other in spite of it all. Very enjoyable !!"
3,Liars Club,Haven't been able to read it yet....looking forwrd to opening the cover and immersing myself in this memoir. Hope its as good as recommended.
3,Fine Memoir,It is simply a personal preference in style but the way Mary Karr describes things ad nauseam left me exhausted and happy to finish this saga although the writing is truly sensitive and brilliant at times.
1,BORING,"This is a tedious tale. The narration is so deadpan that I couldn't care about the narrator or anyone else in her story. It's a sad life and nothing very interesting happens. No insights or lessons learned, no joy."
2,Depressing,Great writer but the book needs more humor interspersed and the story lacks a strong voice fro the main character; a sense of who the narrator really is...turns out to be mostly about her alcoholic parents.
3,Is it me? I was disappointed in The Liars Club.,"I forced myself through The Liars Club. I was very disappointed and began to wonder about politics in publishing. I lent it to two friends who shared my feelings. It wasn't anything specific, I mean the writing was okay (every review pointed out that Ms. Karr is a poet and her use of language is so remarkable: I didn't get that) but some of had a slightly invented feel (I'm sure most memoirists must make up or fill in some blanks with invention) and came across as slightly self-involved. Can't hold a candle to 'Angela's Ashes' or 'Bastard out of Carolina', which it more closely resembles."
1,Not much of a story,"This woman had a strange mother, for sure, but I just didn't think it that great a story. There was a lot of discriptions that just didn't seemed to be relevent to anything excpet her memories of where she played or lived. I was disappointed."
4,Well-written but depressing,"This book is well-written and very hard to put down. However, I did not find this book humorous in the least. The awful incidents of sexual abuse the narrator faced left me feeling depressed for a week. Also, the ""down home Texas"" prose got pretty corny after the first few pages."
2,"Entertaining, but didn't enrapt me...","...like the memoir Blackbird and Still Waters by Jennifer Lauck. Those books were so well written and much more believeable in the way it is written from a child's perspective. I found it hard to believe that a 7 year old really thought in these complex terms about her life (first half of the book). Also, some of her comments on present day were unnecessary and offensive. An ok read, but I'm glad I only paid a dollar for this book at the local $ store!"
2,"I prefer fiction to be labeled ""fiction"", not ""memoir""","Mary stated her mother was in a hurry to begin her family because she was 30 years old upon meeting her father. Assuming she became pregnant immediately after meeting him, that would have put her at 40 years old when the grandmother came to live with them since Mary's sister at that point was 9. Mary says the grandmother was 50 when she moved in with them. That would mean she gave birth to Mary's mother at 10.The writing was excellent, the story was excellent. Just call it what it is - fiction!"
3,An overly descriptive story of dysfunction,"I looked forward to reading this book knowing the awards it won and the many months it lasted on the bestseller list. Surprisingly, I was disappointed. Although Ms. Karr's story is intense, this is a slow read, one loaded with unnecessary metaphors and tangential, distracting references. The author would have earned more sympathy particularly for her mother, in light of her illness, and generally, for her family's dysfunction, had she relayed this account more concisely. I prefer memoirs in the style of Mary Cantwell's AMERICAN GIRL, or MANHATTAN, WHEN I WAS YOUNG, or Russell Baker's GROWING UP."
5,Fantastic Read,"All the reviewers here have picked the bones clean on this work; so I'm going for the Bottom Line.While Mary's story is both very entertaining and very disturbing, it's the flow that matters. This woman ""can really put some words together."" Reading her work is sheer joy. Genius. You can't put it down. A book NOT to be forgotten. Highly Recommended !!!"
4,I have a crush on this writing and this author.,"If you love prose by superb poets (think Ondaatje); can't imagine a raucous, sometimes abusive, Texas childhood in the home of Agent Orange, with two parents violently in love with each other and their daughters, a warm refinery monkey and a could-be literata; want to know how these same two parents filled their younger daughter with grist for memoirs for our narcissistic age (think Tobias Wolf); and are happy to forgo the gym by laughing so hard your whole core ab workout is unnecessary, you will love the work of a writer David Foster Wallace was lucky enough to adore and we are priviledged to read."
4,"Fab, but unfinished","A wonderful memoir - honest and riveting. But I would like to know more, after that harrowing childhood, how the author fared as an adult. She mentions she married. Did it last, does she have children? I developed such emotional involvement with her as a child that I felt at loose ends not knowing more about the woman she grew into."
2,Don't understand the hype,"I picked up this book because of several recommendations and the popular good press. But, after 40 pages, I struggled to see what was so good about it. First of all, to describe this book or Ms. Karr as hilariously funny???? Not sure where anyone came up with that - was the rape scene funny or her mother's insanity? Not only was the book depressing, I didn't feel it was well written - with Ms. Karr going off at times about absolutely nothing. Even after finishing this book and rereading some of the reviews on Amazon, I'm still struggling with the five star ratings this book received."
3,Shocking!,"I enjoyed this rather shocking memoir. It certainly had a surprising amount of mystery and a riveting ""plot"" for a non-fiction memoir! Honestly, many of the actions described seemed more within the realm of fiction than real life. The relationships described certainly took some surprising turns as well. It definitely was one of the more dramatic memoirs that I have ever read!"
2,I likexd the way she expressed herself,It was a good book and I loved some of the lies she told and what her life was like before and after she told a li
2,So hard to believe,"I have just completed reading part I of this book and I am finding it all very hard to believe. I do not believe that a 7 year old can have as much psychological insight into a situation as Mary Karr claims she did when she was 7, not to mention an adult sense of humor. All in all, the gist of her life-story may very well be true, but to me, it seems like Mary Karr has made up all the little details she write about in her book. It is also very very prosaic, and it pales in comparision to Frank McCourt's beautiful poetic memoir."
2,Southern re-fried chicken,"Karr has a gift for the sort of ""colorful"" Southern writing Yankees can't seem to get enough of. But this book is a warmed-over rehash of the truly great Southern writers. Go read the good stuff instead, folks. Or maybe your ""book club"" could read this one so it won't tax your brain so much."
4,It was like she was talking to me,"Mary Karr's memior, The Liar's Club, is an exploration into her traumatic childhood growing up amidst alcohol and other dysfunction. Karr is able to tell her tale in the most conversational tone I have encountered...I often wondered if I wasn't experiencing the events with her! Her prose is engaging. Simultaneously, she makes you laugh out loud while putting an ache in your heart. I highly recommend this worthwile read."
5,Mary Karr,"Mary Karr is hot -- as soon as I finished reading LIT, I bought Liars Club and wasn't disappointed. She's a poet. I love her work and I rejoiced to read her recent article about the significance of the 2009 year end in the New York Times last Sunday. It was as interesting as ever. She's capable of turning a phrase and teaching you something new."
5,Wonderful and thought provoking,"Mary Karr has crafted a beautiful memoir that speaks to the humanity of families, whatever their form. Her writing is full of the glorious characters and wonderful details. Her gift of poetry shines through in the writing. I highly recommend this book.Janine Latusauthor of ""If I Am Misisng or Dead""If I Am Missing or Dead: A Sister's Story of Love, Murder, and Liberation"
2,Bored,"I was really looking forward to reading this NY Times bestseller, award winning, sometimes referred to as life-altering book. I am just over half-way through (a move to CO) and must admit I am bored to tears. The story itself, the writing style, none of it is holding my attention. I keep going hoping that perhaps as she ages, it will become more interesting. The last book I was forced to put down was Infinite Jest (unbelievably after getting over 1/2 way through). I rarely stop reading a book so will trudge through to the end of this one & once again look forward to reading what's next on my list. I just don't get the hype, but hey, that's just my humble opinion."
4,No Lying,This was a very interesting book with lots of discussion points.Sometimes even members of a dysfunctional family do succeed.
3,An Unexpectedly Difficult Book,"Well, the last Daisy book I read ended in ""Hello, Daisy!"", ""Hello, Granny!"" so I'll admit I wasn't ready for some of the issues in this book. Specifically, there is a suggestion of surrogate mothers (the Aunt is sitting on the egg instead of the mother of the egg) as well as the possibility of a pregnancy that doesn't end happily. In this case, the egg doesn't hatch and the Aunt and Mother abandon the egg (""Some eggs just don't hatch"" says the Mother Duck). Daisy doesn't give up. She sits on the egg and it hatches so we have our happy ending.If your child is older than mine (mine was 18mo when I read this to her), be prepared for the following questions:1) Why isn't the mommy sitting on the egg?2) Why does the mommy leave the egg?3) Why don't some eggs hatch?If you feel like delving into these questions, this is a great book. If you're not in the mood, best to hold off on this one.(Beautiful pictures, of course, as expected from the Daisy books.)"
3,I don't get it,"As a fan of the first book, I was a little put off by this one. The art is as beautiful the first, but the story goes kind of flat. I come to expect that somewhere behind the sweetness and warmth of a children's book, should lie some commentary about life. Jane Simmons' first book 'Come Along Daisey,' showed that she knows just that. I left wondering what a Child should think about a mother that doesn't watch her egg, and then gives up on it, and leaves it to her duckling to save the day. In today's world I wonder what kind of conclusions children will draw."
1,NOT NTSC (Pal DVD),"This is not an NTSC DVD, it is a Pal DVD. All the songs listed are not music videos. One disc is a DVD & the other is a CD. They have all tracks listed as if music videos. There is nudity on this DVD as well so no children should buy this DVD. The song (Boys, Boys, Boys) has complete breast & nipple shots. Do not let your child buy this. Wish this DVD was in NTSC format. Thanks Schroeder (DJ WACK ""O"") of Cult Movies Magazine/WACK ""O"" Publishing/Orbital Traxx Records(...)"
4,Challenging but Helpful,"What an amazing and engaging read! This book will challenge your faith, but in the end leave it stronger than before. While I didn't agree with everything the author analyzed, she made an arguement that is worthy of more attention and focus. I will say that her book has refined how I view Christianity and history's influece upon it. The first chapter appears to paint Christianity in a bad light, but if you wait for the second chapter, you'll see the difference become clearer as Douglas begins seperate Today's Christianity from true Christianity. I am still munching on some of this material months later."
2,Pop gun with no pop,"I went through two of these for my 5 year old son. The first one wouldn't pop at all, and they sent me a new one with no hassles whatsoever. I can't complain about the service, they wanted me to be satisfied. The problem is that the next one, which did pop, only popped some of the time and not at all loudly. My son quickly realized that it wasn't a great toy and stopped using it."
1,Pirate Pop gun,This showed up with the cork stuck and breaking apart. I did give it to my son later after I took the string and cork out. He still loves the design.
1,Not so good,This was cheap but didn't work. I couldn't find info on the company it came from to return it. Not a good buy.
2,Gag Gift,I bought this for a gag gift. It is cute but not made very well. It is difficult to make the cork pop out. However for the price and my intentions I did not feel ripped off. LOL. And it did bring a smile to my friends face!
1,okay,"This book is okay. I got a copy of it a few years ago when a friend was moving and gave it away. The recipes are okay, but nothing to rave about. Justin Wilson loves to include his 'humorous' stories and jokes along with the recipes. They mainly should be considered a distraction."
5,For Popeye lovers,"orginal classic episode of the ""old school"" popeye. great for adults that remember waking up early mornings at 5 or 6 am and turning on the tv to see one of these cartoon treasures. Popeye fans will really love this dvd. 205 minutes of popeye!"
4,Very Good Information,"This is actually the second copy of this book I bought; it is so good that I gave it to a friend of mine that is dealing with issues with her teen. I found it very helpful, and I learned alot of things that I was doing with my son were actually intensifying his adolescent-stage rebellion. It was also a breath of fresh air knowing that I'm not the only one dealing with these issues. I suggest reading this book...there IS hope; adolescence is NOT terminal!"
4,Good Insights On Teenagers,"""Adolescene Isn't Terminal"" by Kevin Leman is full of interesting insights and conclusions on how parents can survive the teenage years. Leman covers such topics as;1. Do not be overly controlling of your teenagers - give them room to make mistakes and learn from them.2. Dating3. Sex4. Peer pressure5. Other pressures teens have to deal with6. Hassles of everyday life7. Parents should not sacrifice their teens for a ""succesful"" career. They need us particularly during this time. This chapter was my personal favorite.All in all, the advice and insights were very helpful and encouraging.Read and enjoy. Highly recommended!"
2,Sermon 101,"Good information can be gleaned from this book. Three comments though:1) Leman bends statistics around so that it fits how he wants the puzzle to fit.2) He likes the grabby, shock statements with punchy little antidotes that sound like a sermon to wake sleepy congregants. He does not sound like a person really trying to help you cope with teenagers. I think Anythony E. Wolf has much better information and Wolf conveys things a more personal and realistic manner(Get Out of My Life, But First Can You Drive Me and Cheryl to the Mall).3) Very Christian, even when he makes a point of saying . . . this follows Judeo-Christian beliefs . . . in the same breath he quotes from Matthew. It was a bit much."
1,A Guidebook for Christian Parents,"I agree 100% with the reviewer that said this book should be sub-titled 'A Guidebook for Christian Parents'. Personally, I don't appreciate his religious bent and I think it should be clearly stated that this is where he is coming from."
5,Aaron is AWSOME!!!,"Aaron is the most talented single artist by far and the backstreet boys are the most talented group.....where ever you guys are,you are da bomb and PHAT TO DEATH!!!"
5,BEST CD IN THE WORLD,"Hello, I am a 15 years old girl from Berlin /Germany and I heard first the CD of Aaron when I was 12. I really LOVE him. He's the most talented little boy I know. CONGRATULATION AARON !"
5,"wonderfull story , takes reader through range of emotions","Another brilliant story, utterly believable worrying how accurate it is - may inspire real hijackers. The desire for the hijackers to succeed is only tempered by the overall wish for peace, the deceit involved hard to think that someone could actually be so perceptive in reality. Altogether a fantastic read, and again hard to stop once started."
4,Excellent !!,"A typical Forsyth novel, higly researched and meticulously planned. But the best part of the book was the last 10 lines. Great ending."
4,The Devil's Alternative,A touching and fascinating story to the very end. A book you will cherish and remember. We really loved it.
5,Fye as hell,"You know what im saying,the game gone be fye as hell,cause meth gone be on there busta gone be on the sean paul? ooo it gone be off the hook yall betta go cop dat.ANd ya know something,imma go get it my damn self,AND I GONE BE THE KANG!!"
5,My son is upset,"The game was sold to me saying it was in good condition, but when we put the game in it says the game disc can not be read.So my son can not even play the game."
3,Too much sustaining pedal,"This cd should be beatiful without the sustaing pedal on piano (vibrato on cello, dynamic and agoge bearables)..."
5,Loved this book!,"I really, really, really enjoyed reading this book.It's one of those that you don't want to put down, but get kinda depressed when it is over.The characters are contemporary and fresh and very well developed. The story line is intersting and the backdrop of Jamaica gives you, the reader, the right amount of escape.It also makes some good statements about what it is to be gay trying to fit into a mostly straight world. This is done in a lighthearted way and not whiney.I like that the book and the characters have a sense of humor. There is not enough of that out there in the genre now. The book doesn't take itself too seriously and I like that.I'd really love to see this book made into a movie. Kind of like a ""Big Gay Italian Wedding"" type of thing. I think the whole story would translate very well to the big screen and have a wide appeal.I can't wait to see what Mari writes next!"
5,Simulataneously hysterical and sweet!,"As a regular visitor to Jamaica and a lesbian, I decided one day to Google these two terms together. What I landed on (thank you Google and the SEO powers that be) was a link to this novel. After reading the summary, I decided to take a chance and order - what a great decision!!The constant flow of humor - from sarcasm and one-liners, to (hilarious) sibling banter and outright slapstick - had me laughing out loud from the second page on! I never once found myself bored, and I devoured this book in three days...only because I forced myself to slow down so it wouldn't end so soon.Perfectly wound throughout all of the hysterics were steamy, sandy sex scenes, absolutely insane ex-girlfriends...and even a really sweet love story (or two :)). You will not be disappointed (I know I wasn't)!I pray that a movie version emerges, and I wait not-so-patiently for a sequel to this novel - bring it on, Mari!"
5,Read this when you want to laugh,"There were so many things about this book that drew me in. I think the other reviewers covered it well, but since I now am a big fan I wanted to add my 5 star and comments to the others:-The writing flows across the page and moves this hysterical tale along-If you grew up with multiple generations of an Italian-American family, you are going to relate.I kept seeing my relatives in my head and remembering the family shenanigans from my childhood.-Sweet and silly romance is an added bonus-Some of the passages made me laugh out loud, always a welcome experience in my book!Great job and kudos to this author."
4,A good ole fashioned lesbian rom com!,"It's definitely one of those romances where you shake your head and say 'that would never happen in real life' but I enjoyed it. The author definitely had me laughing whenever she wrote about the main character's family. That part, I could relate to. I would recommend this because I've read a lot of lesbian romances and this one was one of the funniest and most original!"
3,Creased corners,"I was happy with the read and price. However, I was not happy to see the condition that it was shipped in. It was not properly packaged and it resulted in creased corners and pages. I like to think that if I am paying this kind of money for this book I would like it to be in good condition. It bothers me to look at my collection with the creased covers and pages"
2,"Lets talk from the heart, people",It is amazing how my 19 year-old daughter took to these passages. Each message was hand crafted with love as the main tool...wait I have a four-year old son. Its no picnic.
4,Each episode is wonderfully crafted,"There are times that you want to fast-forward episodes of Foyle's War because they have a tendency to drag. Having said that, however, let me point out that each episode is wonderfully crafted, with a lot of attention given to details. The WWII background is all-pervasive and Foyle's inscrutable demeanor is ideally suited for the series. Each episode is unhurried and attempts to leave the viewer completely satisfied with the explanation. For those who have an interest in British Mystery but also hold an interest in WWII, this is the ideal watching option."
5,"Foyle's War, Simply the Best",Foyle's War is simply one of the best of the numerous British mystery series produced. As a fan of the genre I feel this is one of my all time top three series. Michael Kitchen is superb.
5,Exceptional Historical Drama,"THe Foyle's War Series gets better each season. In Set 4, Michael Kitchen returns as the soft-spoken and highly observant Christopher Foyle. He solves mysteries set against the backdrop of WWII. History comes alive again this season with the American soldiers stationed nearby, the murder of Milner's wife, espionage and treason."
5,FOYLE'S WAR FOUR: More outstanding performances,"The FOYLE'S WAR series has been outstanding from the first season on. The fourth season, which takes us further into the struggles of a smart and honorable policeman during WWII, continues to please. An outstanding cast led by the amazing Michael Kitchen with able support of Anthony Howell and Honeysuckle Weeks, takes us into wartime Britain and the delicate balance between fighting a war and upholding the law. Foyle, a most principled policeman, is constantly fighting for justice when those around him would compromise ""for the good of the nation."" By the the end of season four we are left wondering if Mr. Foyle has not lost the battle.It's outstanding theatre which raises issues we face today."
5,The best series.,"This fourth season stands up to the quality of the first three, and everyone in my house eagerly awaits more. The relaxed pace, interesting and compelling characters that are very easy to believe and care about, and the beautiful scenery add to the stark contrast created by the realities of war in World War II England.We all love all these stories and watch them over and over for the flavor of the setting and time as well as the verisimilitude of the characters and events. The mysteries are also well-crafted and believable."
5,Foyle`s War,We loved this as a series now have bought all the Foyle`s War sets. We were so happy to see series 4 hope there are more Please!!!!
5,Great series,"Yet another excellent British series. If you haven't watched it, you should! The premise is a police drama set in Britain during WWII. The plots are interesting and the acting is low key but excellent."
5,Foyle's War - set 4,We love all of these types of mystery theatre British mysteries. They do it best. We've enjoyed this and the other series we've bought and like that we have them on hand for watching whenever we want (especially as years go by and things get harder to find.)
4,Mystery with History,"A picture of how things were in the years of WWII at least from the allied side. While British accents are sometimes hard to translate the plots are excellent , the casting suberb and the feeling that you have magically returned to a period some sixty odd years ago everpresent. Highly recommended."
5,""" NEVER DISAPPOINTED ""","even tho I have seen this entire set on four sundays on one of the PBS stations , I was thrilled when I saw it on Amazon to be pre-ordered and got it for $ 44.00 no S/H .I must have lucked out .won't go into detail how good I think this series is as so many have done a great job in their reviews . But, everyone who buys these sets , be sure to view the ' extras ' such as "" the truth behind "" each story . That makes it even better for me . I have all four sets now and will look for #5 for pre- order the minute Amazon offers it . I'll be one of the first to do so .they spend almost ( sometimes more ) then America does on any of it's t.v. movies and boy it is better then some of the theater releases people are willing to spend an arm and a leg for, especially if they have family . Kudos Britain ...and michael kitchen : )"
3,Common Sense and Good Judgement,"This is a good and easy book to read. Its bulleted format and straight-forward presentation makes it simple to digest in even one sitting. The weeks are broken out as chapters, with milestones and activity checklists and questions at the end of the chapters helping to reinforce the message.Using it as a guide for the first six weeks in a new position, its probably most effective to stay aligned with the chapter for the week that you're in at work, although things don't always progress at the same pace for everyone at every job, plus, the format makes it so easy to read ahead - which is not necessarily a bad thing.Interestingly, after six weeks in my new job, I now find myself back in my last position. Among many other factors, the new job wasn't what I was led to expect. The lesson, ""Don't Burn Any Bridges"", should be in the prequel."
4,lacking picture detail for bigger boats,"for your basic crafts and rafts and other simple structures this is a great book. however, i felt it a bit lacking when it came to sailboats. it seemed he didnt have as much to put in. still a nice book and would recommend it, but perhaps there is a better overall book for boat building."
2,Just Started,I just started using the product. Have not noticed a changed as of yet. It is hard to put this all over my body myself. It is also alot messier than I thought it would be.
1,This still around?,"I give this a 1 star rating. I found this quite hilarious, I split a gut watching it. Then I realized I spent money on this; it's a bad movie, although nostalgic if you wan to trelive the big hair era of the 1980's."
3,i tried hard to like this movie !,"i was a bboy and dj back in the early 80's, i love hip hop, and i am very glad that i was able to experience hip hop in its birth and rise. but, this movie realllllly took the cake in being 'hollywood'. i tried soooooo hard to get into this movie, just because it was 'supposed' to represent hip hop back in the day. but hollywood as it always does, misinterprets they understanding of certain things. shabadoo and shrimp will always be pioneers, but this movie definately was disappointment.....and all that florescent stuff , good lord !!! And I only give it a 3 star because of the pioneers in the movie and lucinda is hot !"
4,Great Title,"In reference to reviewer Bud Gott: ""To this day, whenever I hear of a sequel with a ""2"" in its title, I automatically add ""Electric Boogaloo"" to it. Try it - it's fun.""Miss Congeniality 2: Electric BoogalooAwesome!"
2,broken .,"The breakdance trio are back . this time around they're trying to stop the demolition of a community center , and at the same time solve some personal issues , like kelly's - Lucinda dickey - theater dancing career , ozone's - adolfo quinines - feelings towards Kelly and turbo's - Michael chambers - love interest .If the first movie was great and full of amazing breakdancing , cool music and acceptable story , then this sequel is the complete opposite . you get bad acting , bad choreography , bad music and bad costume design . even ICE T sucked in this film . what a waste of good dancing talents.But ,If you liked the first movie , like me , then you can't resist buying this sequel. at least you'll see turbo's ceiling dance . the best thing in the film .ozone cheesy roof dancing and Lucinda dickey 's not that bad acting .Otherwise avoid ."
3,"Great Movie, but...","Its a great movie with eye popping moves, but the whole storyline and plot is a bit corny at times. The first movie (Breakin') is way better so I advise anyone to watch that one first. overall the sequel is alright, but in my opinion the first movie was better."
1,DISGRACE TO THE HIP HOP CULTURE,"this hollywood version of hip hop was a disgrace to the culture. this is why alot of the original bboys were against bringing hip hop mainstream and a perfect example of the media taking things out of perspective. any bboy (or claims to be) that liked this movie or even thinks it has culture in it, probably has no footwork ability, does air moves with their shoes off, and does headspins with a helmet..im disappointed and surprised that the few pioneers in this movie actually let it be filmed this way. Go get style wars, wild style, freshest kids, and scratch, then you'll know what im talking about."
2,Don't even bother!,"It was a total let down. I had heard the hype, and it was boring beyond boring! The 1st was bad but alright. It was watchable but to make a sequel boy they must be despreate for money. If your into your old time hip hop stick to BEAT STREET. if your into ur fresh hip/ hop watch You got served or honey!"
3,"ELECTRIC BOOGALOO, an ok sequel.","I saw this when it was release theatricaly and i must say i was dissapointed. The dancing and music was good but what an awful story and what terrible acting. This was obviously rushed out to cash in on the success of the original movie. It was only a few months after BREAKIN' that people ere getting let down by this poor sequel. Ok there are people that like it, even prefer it to the first one, but no it is not great as sequels go. Lucinda Dickey is about the only thing that saves it, she can really dance."
2,Not Karajan's best work.,"Like some of the other reviewers here, I am a big fan of most of Karajan's work. He was a brilliant conductor who managed to get a uniquely lush and vibrant sound out of his orchestra's. That being the case, it surprises me how unappealing his performances of the 6th pastoral symphony are. (to me at least.)This one, for instance. It just doesn't sound like it's played with much warmth, sensitivity or attention to detail. The tempo is too fast, it sounds a bit harsh and loud in spots and overall, it just doesn't evoke the verdant countryside as well as it should.Perhaps I am splitting hairs, the orchestra of course is a great one and it's marvelous music. But I would definitely advise looking into some other renditions of this fantastic symphony. Listen to Verdi's operas or Beethoven's 5th, 7th and 9th symphonies to hear Maestro Von Karajan at his best."
3,not the best version of this,The pastoral mood of this wonderful composition is lost in this version. I have heard many others which are as good or better. Two other reviewers list a few and I would take any of those first. Perhaps Karajan - he made several cycles through Beethoven -- recorded a better version but I would recommend starting elsewhere and sticking with Karajan in Symphony #9 and perhaps #5. The recorded sound is good.
2,Hard on the Ears,"I wish I had read all the reviews of this album before I bought it. I figured you couldn't go wrong with Herbert Von Karajan, master that he is generally considered to be, but I was wrong.The performance is almost bland, and is made almost unlistenable by the expanded volume dynamics, i.e., if you set the volume level so you can hear the soft opening bars, you will be blown out of your seat and running for the volume control when it gets louder. Really unbearable."
5,It was very perfact performance.,I like this symphony very much. Most of all I reco mend this album. Why? very wonderful.
3,Pretty good,"Although I was looking for something more in the line of a complete workout, this DVD does provide exactly what it says it will: drills and footwork. Everything was explained along with some very good insight and tips into training and what it takes to work towards becoming a champion."
2,depressing,"This cd is a real let down. I have it now and cant even get rid of the rubbish because the used cd stores dont want it. I am a skinny puppy and tear garden fan, but my main love is ambient music. If you like cevin's side project download then you might like this cd. I think it is just noisey and repetitive. Though it does have a lot of interesting sounds scattered about, most of the songs struggle to carry a decent beat."
2,Eh...,"Cevin key's ""Music For Cats"" is merely mediocre... It takes a lot of patience to enjoy this album. It contains a lot of boring continous electronic sounds of nothing. It's not like ""Download"",or ""Doubting Thomas"". It's just a very dull boring album. sometimes even aggravating at times. Thankfully his follow up ""The Ghost of Each Room"" is much much better..."
5,AWESOMENESS,"Buy this for song 8 and 10. Beautiful music with a kick and some humor, too. What more can you ask for."
1,Re-recorded,"This is NOT the best of Little Richard. The best of Little Richard are his original recordings.I hate it when artists go back into the studio and re-record all of their classic hits for release on another (usually smaller) record label that then promotes these recordings to an unsuspecting public as the ""best"" or ""greatest"" hits. I have been burned by this practice before, and no matter how good a re-recording might be, it just isn't what I thought I bought --the original songs. Therefore, on principle, I must give this 1 star."
3,Fairly comprehensive compilation of hits (Re-recordings),"This ""Best of"" set contains the most well-known Little Richard tracks. The quality is decent, although purists will be disappointed, as none are original recordings."
3,"Indispensable for the collectors, but low-quality","It's the only one CD which contains all recordings from the Jack Clement Studio's session (Nashville, 1976) issued on the vinyl album K-Tel LP-462 plus the extended version of ""Tutti Frutti"" never issued.The true collector of the Little Richard's music must possess all his stuff regardless of anything.But the sound quality of this CD is poor:1. The tracks 14 & 19 have both a strange sound artifacts during first 3 sec. and breaks suddenly! So both are a incomplete tracks - e.g. the length of track 14 is only 1:44 instead of 2:07. (I have these tracks on another CD for compare. Unfortunately this another CD contains only 16 tracks, so I have been obliged to purchase this CD with 21 tracks.)2. Some tracks have a too long silences (up to 10 sec.) at the beginning and/or at the end. So you have to listen the silence between tracks sometimes up to 20 sec.It's a disgrace to the Madacy's sound engineers!"
4,Classic melodic pop rock,"This is one of the great early albums from Pittsburgh's king cool of melodic pop rock. Great tunes, memorable choruses, nice harmonies and Donnie's powerful screaming vocals are real, old fashioned rock and roll. This is a great record at a bargain price. You can't go wrong buying this CD along with ""Live at Nick's Fat City,"" which has more of the super hits of the under-appreciated Donnie Iris. ""Follow That Car"" is an amazing composition guaranteed to lift your spirit and get your toes tapping. I love the great harmonies on ""I Want You Back,"" which is my favorite song on this album. ""Injured in the Game of Love"" and ""10th Street"" are classics that you will remember fondly forever. Enjoy!"
3,not as great as i expected,"I really like this artist, and was all excited about an album between his Ah! Leah! and Fortune albums, but it seemed to be the most purposely commercial and quickly put out album I'd ever heard from him, and since. I think its a contractual obligation album, and not even close to King Cool or High and the Mighty, or even Fortune. Not bad, but a background album, instead of a shut up, I'm playing music type."
5,Ideal for Tourists & Residents Alike,"When I first discovered this book when visiting Paris, I thought it was the most innovative idea and a real gem. After many more trips, I have found it to be invaluable and more useful than I could have ever realized. Many of my Parisian and French friends have their own copies so it is not just a ""tourist"" thing. Even when I am in the States, I find it useful for recalling the zip code for my friends' Parisian addresses or remembering where that one great bistro is located when recommending it to a friend. The pocket-sized scale of the book is most helpful in fitting in an average suit pocket or the most elegant of evening purses. It is a Parisian must along with real café and good pastries."
2,Really is For Dummies,"I am a long time user of Quicken (Quicken 98, 99,) and found this book giving fair instructions for first time users, but answered NONE of the questions I had regarding features missing in the new Quicken 2002....Very disappointing. May be ok for those who have never used Quicken AND can't follow the HELP from within the program."
4,Very 80's,Wasn't sure if I should rate this as a 3 or 4 star. It fits the purpose I bought it for; so I gave it a 4. I bought this book for how to make pretty folding chair covers. I haven't tried my hand at it yet but the instructions are very clear and their are alot of pictures for someone who is like me...a novice at best. I haven't touch a sewing machine since home ec. in middle school. Some of the projects look too much for me and I will probably not try them. Most of the decor in this book looks very old; 80's flashback old.
4,sew-it-yourself home decor,I liked the examples and the layout of the products. The easy step by step guide for a novice like me that is understandable
4,AS advertised.,These work as claimed. they are a bit big but work well for my hand and finger dexterity. I will be purchasing another set to add to this one
1,Wrong Size,"The description states that these are supposed to be 45mm (1.77 inches), but the set that I received is much larger. The circumference of the set I received measures 6 inches/152.4mm (3 inches/76.2mm in diameter), so I'm not sure what the 45mm measurement is supposed to be reflective of. I ordered this set for my 7 year old niece, but I can barely hold them in my hand, let alone move them. I am returning them, and hope to find a more suitable sized set somewhere else."
1,Review,I wouldn't recommend this product. It gets moisture on the inside and after several months of use it froze at about 200 degrees.
2,Discolored face after 2 uses,"This things works ok, I suppose. But after only two uses, the glass on the face became discolored almost to the point of being unreadable."
3,Take your time placing this on the grill,"Works well, but be careful using on charcoal grills. If you put the thermometer down on the cooking grate just after dumping the coals, and the coals are still super hot, the glass on the thermometer will cloud up a bit."
2,Not usable,"While I find the thermometer accurate,the ability to read the temperature is difficult because of the small lettering. Also, the interior of the glass surface clouds over while in use and makes it completly unusable during the cooking process. As a result, I found the item was a waste of my money and would not recommend the product."
2,"Lasted a Few Times, Not Recommended","After just a few uses the glass became cloudy and unclear. In addition, the text on the gauge became blackened and unreadable. I did try to clean it, but the result was the same. It seemed to work fine the few times I was able to use but soon became UNUSABLE. Now looking for a new thermometer. I would not recommend this one."
2,This product failed,This product failed after several months of use. As a part time chef I rely upon an accurate grill temperature. Shortly after the first use I detected moisture in the interior. The temperature was slow to move either up or down the scale. Finally it froze up and is useless. I should have bought a professional grade to start. My error.
4,Pollini is a great pianist and Chopin was a great composer.,"This excellent recording of Chopin's two great sonatas shows how a great pianist can renew two of the most played pieces in the pianistic repertoire. I loved this recording because, first of all, Pollini's fantastic mechanism makes it a big thrill-ride. In the past, going to Pollini recitals I have not been impressed with his musical talent. Though he has always had the best technique- even Artur Rubinstein, a judge, said it when Pollini won the Chopin Competition of Warsaw when he was only 18. But what about Mr. Pollini's ability to convey a feeling of beauty and nuance in a piece? Of course he has always lacked in this respect, but this Chopin CD shows more in that direction. He does take time in the dramatic middle movements of the Sonatas to relax, but I get the feeling that he doesn't quite relax enough...Anyhow, this recording is worth listening to even if it does have a few ways to improve."
2,Painful to watch,I recently saw this in New York. And quite frnkly i don't see what the big deal is about. I could have gone down to Nostrum in Brooklyn and picked up better more intelligent dialouge. Is this what our society considers literarture? As an African american woman I feel ill to see trash such as this portraying African american men in such a stereotypical light (from an african american writer no less.) Suzan Lori Parks is no more than an uncle tom who panders to the predominantly white theatre patron. I personally would like to see more plays about black men in positions of power and responsibility not the same old junk that america has pidgeon holed them into as drunken lazy womanizing thugs.
4,Gritty Angry Boy Drama,"Parks' play is a well crafted drama about two brothers' lives smoothly built around their relationship with 3-card monte. She does a strong job of handling the darker aspects of sibling rivalry, poverty, and family. I mostly enjoyed Topdog/Underdog for its raw toughness and the way the two-character structure brought out the inner workings and different demons of the two brothers. While not the greatest play ever, it is a good, solid dramatic work and definitely worth reading."
1,I feel moor stoopid fo redin' dis play,"I'll make this quick. Saw it. Read it. Hated it. This was required reading for my dramatic theory class last semester and bonus points for having seen it. It was very tense and exhausting in the beginning. More tense and exhausting towards the middle and by the end I was ready to yell out ""shoot the Son of a #$%^& already and end this so I can so home and do something productive."" In 10 years when people are considering what plays to revive from the past this play will have been long forgotten save for the fact that it was written by an African american writer, which is all fine and great but is not solid ground within itself to merit te rave reviews it has recieved from certain members of the press. All in all I suggest NOT seeing this play or reading it if you value your sanity. It is extreamly mindless and boring."
1,Stinky Dog,About the only thing I wanted to do after seeing this was demand my money back. This has to be one of the most unimaginative plays I have ever seen. It reminded me of a really bad Saturday night live parody meets Friday part 2 but at the end the writer tried to make it poingnant by adding a death. I don't know why this was even printed. If I was a tree that lost my life to print this play I would come back as a ghost a haunt the publisher till his dying day.
1,Just a Dog,"I am a casual reader of drama and a casual theater-goer; so take my opinion here for what it is worth. I picked up Topdog/Underdog because it had won a Pulitzer Prize. I was very disappointed. 109 pages of largely inane dialog that ends with tragedy -- tragedy that I as a reader did not feel a bit. There is a certain cleverness here: characaters named Booth and Lincoln; Lincoln works as Abe Lincoln at an arcade where he is shot throughout the day. This play obviously did something for other readers, but it did not do it for me.An idea for a sequel: a play with characters named Kennedy, Patsy (also called Oswald), Ruby, Tony (godfather to the children and a soprano), and an unnamed Big Brother. By play's end Kennedy, Oswald and Ruby are all dead and Big Brother is in bed with the Godfather."
4,Hearing the Enjoyment,"This recording was probably the best at the time of its release and some time after, and one of the other reviews is right in that it contains a more ""live"" sound than would be some others with much studio editing. Perlman gives his signature warm sound, and Zuckerman is probably the most notable violinist to also champion the viola. One hears the enjoyment in the music, which is what makes Perlman in particular so special as a musician. I give it 4, not 5 stars, though, because the last star must be reserved for the much newer recordings of Augustin Dumay/Viktoria Hagen/Salzburg (for one of the best interpretations of Mozart ever) and that of the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra (for a better understanding of how the work is as symphonic as it is concertizing)."
3,I heard much better,"The Best performance of the Mozart Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola is by Viktor Pikaizen and David Oistrakh with Moscow Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra conducted by Igor Oistrakh. It was recorded on LP, USSR. I am wondering why do not rerecord on CD. I am looking forward that more than anything else. It was something unbelievably magical performance. Unfortunately LP wore out after too much playing and now I can not find another. Hope they will think to rerecord that magic again and put on world wide on sale. Great, unearthly performance!!!"
3,It's okay,I would have gone for a darker color if u want more if a bronze look.also it's fragile-it sort of broke.
2,Lacklustre,"The synopsis sounded exciting enough but I was disappointed when I started reading it.Characters did not have much depth.The plot was fairly predictable after a while and all I wanted to do was to skim through the book to confirm my conclusion.I was also disappointed with the portrayal of the Chinese community in the book as its perception is that they are made up of gangs and thugs and Chinatown is a dangerous place to be in especially for a white person.As a Chinese,I was certainly unhappy with the unflattering image given to the Chinese characters in the book."
5,BETTERS GRISHAM'S LATEST!!!!,"A literary rollercoaster ride!!!!! Anyone who is smart enough to grab this book is in for a realllly good read....great characters....very unusual plot and set in my hometown, San Francisco...what more could you ask for....i'd like to have this book about 150 pages longer.....this new author is definitely a keeper.....loved the author's background on this story....and hope he quits his day job and starts churning 'em out FAST!!!!"
5,Winner,"This combines the leadership insights of 5 outstanding coaches in the NFL, the savvy of a top agent and the writing skill of an author who tells their story with gripping clarity. It is an absolute winner, a must read for anyone who truly wants to understand what makes a National Football League team/franchise click. The coaches are an NFL who's who - Jon Gruden, Mike Holmgren, John Fox, Andy Reid, Mike Sherman. The agent is Bob LaMonte, a former coach himself, who has rocketed to the top as a sports agent. The author is Robert L. Shook who (according to the jacket) has authored 48 books and his talent shows throughout as he makes the insights of agent and coaches come alive. Beyond this, the book will be invaluable to business leaders; indeed anyone who has, or wants to assume responsibility for developing an organization, motivating people, achieving personal goals, or coming out a winner. ""Winning The NFL"" way is both a winner and a guide to winning."
1,"me, me, me, me, me",If Mr. LaMonte could just tell us the Leadership Lessons to be learned instead of stories about himself and why he's is such a great agent the book would be 5 stars. This whole book is about self-promotion which is fine if he didn't tell you that the book was about Leadership Lessons.
1,Not Recommended.,"This book's title leads one to believe it is something that it is not.Designed for absolute beginners, it would indeed be a great tool for introducing a novice to the basics of horse care, management and handling. If, however, this is the type of information that you need, you are in no way a person who should consider, much less attempt to train a horse.For those advanced enough to contemplate the training process, or perhaps looking for suggestions to refine your technique or to address a behavorial issue, this book is almost insulting, as it leans toward addressing subjects such as how to halter a horse and lead a horse, how to pick out hooves, etc - it is completely inappropriate."
3,Brownies were a little ...okay ALOT dry,I'm only writing this review to let you know the actual outcome of one of the recipes. I fell in love with Gifts In A Jar because they make great unique gifts. I made 4 jars today to give to teachers. Because this was my first time giving the gift to others I thought I'd try the recipe to taste what they would be making. They were VERY dry. Have one with a big glass of milk. The jars themselves came out very cute but I wished I had tasted the recipe before I decided to do them. I am a little disappointed. Just thought you'd like to know too. Try the recipe first and then decide if you want others to think this is your culinary best. I wish I had time to get another gift. Oh well.
5,A Complete Work of Art...,"I never realized I liked Sequentia until I heard this CD. I once borrowed their other CD's from a friend, which succeeded in putting me asleep. But don't miss this one! The booklet gives the history of each song (very intriguing) plus the words in latin and english. The arrangements are beautiful, sometimes ecstatic, and will whisk you away to another, simpler world. Perfect for a relaxing bath or an in-depth study of ancient music. The songs are divided into three sections, first ""songs of the harp,"" second ""the image of dawn"" and third ""desire and seduction."" My favorites are the song about swans played through an actual swan's bone and ""sauvissima nunna"" - an amorous dialogue between a seducer and a nun. There is a complete English translation for each song that makes you realize how poetic the words really are. Not the CD to play in the background (it will get monotonous) but to listen to with rapt attention. With this CD, listening is a rewarding experience!"
1,"LARGE PRINT, LARGE SPACES, NO SUBSTANCE!","I bought this book because a friend recommended it...I want my $.... back! I read it in 30 minutes...poor, poor, poor grammer and what could have been a very interesting story sadly told in a tiring way!"
4,The February 2005 revised edition is a better buy,"Great content, but save your money and buy the newer edition. I give it 4 stars because I think the new release is worth 5. This version from 1999 was great in its time but is out of print and only available from used bookstores. The newest edition released in February 2005, ISBN 1578730457, includes an excellent new glossary and is available from Amazon for only $24.95.The White Book provides answers and insights to the four most basic questions:Who are we?Where did we come from?What are we supposed to be doing here?Where are we going?It was the first book I read that filled in the holes that I had found in other spiritual and metaphysical systems of thought."
5,An Extraordinary Book!,"I first read the original version of this book in 1987. Reading it changed my whole outlook on life and was instrumental in continuing my spiritual journey along a path of truth. No more mystical airy fairy stuff, at last I had found where I could get answers to my questions. It set me on a path of self understanding, growth and evolution that continues to this day and of which I am entirely grateful. I found that Ramtha covered every topic imaginable and laid to rest many otherwise mysteries surrounding life.This book (affectionately called The White Book) can be read and re read, and one will always learn something new and great that can immediately be applied to life ..... they are the teachings of a Master.I highly recommend this book as a worthwhile addition to any library, that can be referred to often for continual inspiration and knowledge."
2,Good Book -- Bad Price,"The book itself is good, but the price for this book is ridiculous. The list price on the book itself is only $24.95. I only recently found the link from the Ramtha website that offers the book at this price: [...] I don't know why Amazon is selling it for so much. I found it on Barnes & Noble website for $84. Hope you can save some money by ordering it through the Ramtha website. I sincerely do not know why the cost of this book is so out of control, or maybe it is very much in control of someone who is looking to make a lot of money on a decent book with only slightly new ideas."
5,My life has never been the same...,"I found this book at a used bookstore in San Diego. After leaving the bookstore I went to a coffee shop and read it the whole way through. It opened my mind and changed my perception of reality. Even if you don't believe in Ramtha himself, this book is undeniably filled with wisdom. I've read many books on spirituality, but this book challenged me like no other."
1,The White Book review,JZ Knight is a fraud and Ramtha does not exist. Steven Weinberg wrote this book with a team. JZ Knight has used the Ramtha scam to bilk millions from good people who like the stolen information found in this book.
1,The book of deception,"With an open mind I bought this book. After I read this book it appeared that this book brings fiction, Buddhist, and yogic philosophy together and markets that as a new product. I was highly disappointed to see how people take advantage of the seekers of the truth. I personally believe that the Buddhist teachings (i.e., mediation, mindfulness) can truly uncover the truth; however, it is very sad when these sacred teachings are used by irresponsible people to deceive others. Please investigate for yourself."
1,Ramtha: The White Book,"Well, I would like to give a good review of this book. Unfortunately, I did not receive it. I ordered it Oct. 22, and never received it. Nobody is able to help resolve this issue. I am in Iraq and I have limited availability of internet.David Browndav.brown2@[...]"
4,Great light for the price,"This light was purchased to replace a large old overly ornate 1970's era chandelier in my dining room. The light is the perfect size and makes the room look larger as it takes up much less space than the old light. This light is capable of handling 5 100 watt bulbs, but that is far too bright! 5 60 watt equivalent CFL's are just right! The light is attractive and fits my room decor perfectly. The light comes with a long chain and wire so you can hang it at least 5 feet from the ceiling if yours are that high. I only hung it on the first ring. The reason for the four stars rather than 5 are the poor instructions. There are no wiring directions at all, and the light assembly sheet is poorly translated to English but the diagram is fine. Despite the poor instructions, the assembly and hook up are fairly easy and it was up in about an hour. I am very happy with the look and function and would recommend this to anyone."
1,Almost....,I would love to buy this video but it is INSANELY OVER-PRICED! Are you kidding me! At least put a gun on me if your gonna rob me!
4,"Great, just too big","Does what is supposed to do. It fits my SKB 4 space rack fine. My only complain is that it takes 2 rack spaces, but other than that works great."
2,Not what I expected.,This was not the copy of the book I expected. There is a 25th anniversary edition and this wasn't it.
1,you can't read a book as bad,The book brings out some good bible facts but as soon as you get into it you find out he then writes rubbish. So don't read it. If you want to find out about heaven read the bible not this book.
4,Great product,"It was really tough to find a clear vanilla for use in clear glazes, so I was happy to find this. My only issue is that the bottle looks nothing like the one in the picture."
3,very cute tin,"I ordered the Bettie Page tin for a friend for Christmas. It arrived quickly, but not in time for Christmas! The only thing wrong with it was a loose rivet, but my coworker loved it!"
5,Self reliance and pioneering spirit,"If you have pioneering ancestors, a desire for knowledge and self-reliance, an interest in practical sciences, and a desire to be able to be more independent, this is a good reference."
1,"Listen to the samples, don't make my mistake",I bought a CD by Genie and Troy Nilsson because I saw it recommended on the Lorena McKennitt page. After I bought it I noticed it is recommended all over. I finally figured out this is a marketing gimmick and that someone is just pumping up the recommendations. When I got my CD it sounded like they made it at home on their computer. Next time I will be more careful.
2,Gave it a try but I didn't like it,"I downloaded the sample MP3s ""Quiet Place"", ""Sacred Sky"", and ""When All the Light is Gone."" I gave them each several listens and they just never grabbed me. The only way I can describe it is ""Muzak"". I really can't see buying it. Still everyone's taste is different. If you think this is for you download the MP3s and listen to all the samples before you buy. It saved me the price of a CD."
5,WHisper is my super go to rest nite-time music,"I really appreciate that unlike some other artists who only let their CD's last 35 minutes or so, Genie fills her CD's all the way full so that if you let them repeat play all daylong, like I do, you have so much more variety.When I have folks over for supper I also play the music so we can talk about the old times. WHat a delightful bed of clouds Genie's music provides for our friend get-togethers.ANyone who values peaceful quiet times will thank Genie for providing a wonderful whisperey experience."
1,Not what you think,"I gave it a try because I thought it might be like Enya. Uh, it's not as I discovered. It's really sappy religious music from a band that normally makes children&#65533;s music about the Bible. If you got here from the Enya links I suspect those are a scam by the artist. Few people who like Enya will like this stuff. Not to say that there aren&#65533;t people who would like it, just not the &#65533;Enya&#65533; crowd. It&#65533;s more like the 700 Club Crowd. I just don&#65533;t want others to be fooled."
5,Whisper is great music for massage,Genie's voice does something very cool to my nervous system.It's very much like the feeling of a good massage.
1,Wasn't my taste,This might be okay if you are into really cheesy music. Frankly this is to Celtic music was Donnie Osmond is to rock music. The nicest thing I could say about it is that it is a really bad take-off on Enya. Save your money.
1,Not a lot to like on this CD but the potential is there,"I have three problems with this CD:1. It sounds like the poor woman is singing from the bottom of a well, her voice is tiny and echos too much. I think it has to do with the way the CD was recorded since nobody can really sing that badly. I have the feeling she might have a nice voice hidden away beneath the clutter.2. As I listened I kept thinking ""I already heard this song"" but no, it just sounded like every other song on the CD: the same.3. The keyboards sounds like someone bought a cheap Casio like my kid has. Doesn't anyone play a real piano anymore?Now I listened too some samples before I bought this and I thought I would like it once it was one my stereo. I figured the music quality of the sample was just degraded. Nope, that's what it really sounds like. This one is going to the used CD shop right now I am afraid. If they had a better-produced CD with better keyboards I might give it a try."
4,Good Product,It Charges the battery really fast when you need it. The only problem with it it's a noise it makes when charging.
2,Gary Hoyt,Two out of two went back to WalMart $(42.77/2005)I bought Schmacher because the present charger that I have owned since the 1970's is a Schmacher and still operational. IT has been a supurb product BUT this newer breed of Schmacher chargers seems to leave allot to be desired.
1,charger,"charger is ok but the number of charger is too close to the 12000a. Wanted 12000a got 1200a. Pay attention, seller home & beyond are not customer friendly."
2,charge review,"This charger is electronic. For charging batteries it works fine. As a 12vdc power supply it will not work. You cannot connect anything to it other than a battery. A headlamp or a backup sump pump, or any other 12vdc appliance will not work with this unit. Just so you know.Schumacher SSC-1000A Automatic Speed Battery Charger"
1,Here we are,"Today is April 13, 2012. My order was placed on March 26, 2012. So far no sign of the product. I hope I receive it by tomorrow or as soon as possible."
4,Works to charge my motorhome.,"I don't know about other reviews, but I've not had a problem using this charger. I didn't take time to read the operating manual, but briefly. It is a bit confusing at first and running it off my generator requires more factors to consider. With the generator it hasn't charged over 13 volts. Running about 9 hours it charged both new house batteries from 11.9v to 12.7v. The generator was also running the A/C. So it wasn't supplying full load to the charger. When I was done at the RV switching the A/C off boosted the charger rate .5v. Which brings up another quirk. The charger said the batteries were at 57% charge. Turning the charger off and then on gave me a 100% charge reading and voltage check at 12.7v. I WAS RELIEVED. AFTER MONTHS OF FRUSTRATION. Checking out the RV converter/charger because it wouldn't charge the batteries and after adding a $125 solar charging system which doesn't seem to do anything either."
4,battery charger,the charger works fine. I'm concerned that it is all plastic and my last one was all metal I hope it will last as long as my previous charger which was 10 years old
1,Very Disappointed--- It Has a FAN!!!!,"I planned on using this unit to charge my auto batteries and then leave it on trickle charge. However, it has a FAN which constantly runs and will wear out, just like the fans in the PC's do. I don't know, but I also bet that if the fan bearings fail and the blades won't spin, the charger microprocessor will not operate for safety reasons. Really poor product design to use up fan life when you want to trickle charge a battery over the winter."
4,good for price,It got here quickly and works good. I have had no trouble with it. It is a good product for the price.
2,Not too smart,Not very happy with this charger! many times it shows 100% charged and unplug and reconnect then shows the real charge. if the charge is less than 50% takes hours on high charge. seen voltage at 15.6? sounds like it may cook the battery.
5,Charger,The charger was received in the time stipulated. The charger works very well on all types of batteries I have tried it on.
4,Good charger,"This charger is nice and fairly compact. The cables all store away under the handle which is retractable (although it might take a little bit of work to get the cables to fit in the compartment). I have had no issues with this product and it has functioned flawlessly. The only reason I give it four stars is because it feels a little cheap, although nothing has broken or anything."
2,"This is not a 120/40/15/2 Amp Charger, it's only 12/8/2 Amps","This is not what Amazon is thinks it is. They have confused the SC-12000A Schumacher Speedcharge Battery Charger, Model# SC-12000Awhich is no longer available and substantially a more powerful unit.This listing (this one above, SC-1200A) has the correct picture and model number, but the descriptive text in the title and details touts the specs of the the 12000, not the 1200.I sent it back today once I saw that it was the less powerful charger. I missed the Gold Box this week because I saw this unit and thought it was the better unit. I went out today and bought locally as I can't wait for an alternate item to ship.One of the earlier reviews (4-12-2007) alludes to this issue but it appears this was not Amazon's mistake. A model number with a single zero difference enables confusion all the way around."
1,Stay away from this charger!,"Stay far, far, far, away from this charger. I walked away from tested, good, low charge battery being charged on the 8amp setting connected to a 750CCA regular car battery and when I came back a couple hours later it was boiling and still trying to charge! I checked the charge voltage and it was at 16 volts (measured with a Fluke meter)! Bad, very bad, charger and not automatic or smart at all."
3,Very noisy,"This thing is NOISY. I got it to charge and maintain a battery for a back-up sump pump, was going to have it in the equipment room in the basement, so didn't think noise would be an issue for me (saw other reviewers mention it). Even so, it's too loud. There's loud humming noise from the fans which are always on, and when charging a high-pitch tone joins the mix. It also draws 10 watts at idle when not even charging. Totally not suitable for this purpose.Otherwise it seemed to charged my 75 AH maintenance-free sealed deep cycle battery no problem, and went into battery maintain mode as expected.Update: purchasedSchumacher SEM-1562A 1.5 Amp Speed Charge Maintainerand much happier now. This unit doesn't have a fan and consumes only 2 watts while maintaining, and no transformer noises. Maybe I was just trying to use wrong product for my purpose. But I did want to have the ability to charge the battery faster than over several days..."
1,Junk,Stay away from this product. The fan on mine quit about a week after I purchased it and now the charger itself has stopped working. Seems it doesn't like cold weather. Bought it at Wally World and they won't take it back.
1,Bad product,"After the battery is mostly charged, this charger goes to 16.4 volts and starts boiling the electrolyte. Normally when battery is mostly charged, the voltage should not go that high!!! The charger did not switch to a float mode either as it was supposed to.To make sure it is not a battery issue, I tried to use this charger on 3 different batteries and saw the same result. Charger at 16.4 volts and boiling electrolyte. If I was not keeping a close eye on the charger, it would have destroyed my battery by boiling out all electrolyte. I thought this thing is ""smart"" and ""automatic.""Did I also mention that one time I was tried to use the charger(see above for results) it was making a lot of loud noise because of a constantly running cooling fan."
4,Schumacher SC-1200A SpeedCharge 12/8/2 Amp Charger/Maintainer/Starter By Tim C.,Works just fine for everyday use at home. Use on car/truck/riding mower/and so on. Reason for 4 stars is the charger does not have the starting amperies. But give it five minutes on a dead battery and the charger will start what ever it is hook to. So I would recommend this charger for home use only. This was not a bad deal for 30 dollar bill thanks amazon.com for keeping the good prices and having fast shipping and excellent customer service like always!!!
1,"Warning: did not charge gel cell batteries, did not show capacity","This product is worthless for gel cell batteries. Moreover, it does not accurately reflect the capacity of batteries. Plus, while charging, no matter how low the amperage, the irritating fan operates at full speed. Don't waste your time with this product."
5,Does the job,Too light to even imagine that there is anything inside but does the job efficiently. Cannot ask for anything more.
4,Works Well,"Works great. It's a little slow, but for the money I can't complain. My only other issue with it is that the storage compartment for the cables and cord is a little small. I find it a little difficult to get it all stuffed back in there, but it can be done!"
2,it works...but for how long,The Good:It charges and has not overcharged any of my batteries. The variable charge rate is handy for different capacity batteries.The Bad:I don't think you could build a cheaper snap fit plastic case. It feels like it came from the dollar store.It is almost impossible to fit the power cord and charging cord back in the hollow storage cavity. I removed the handle and this helped. Handle? Why do you need a handle?The fan runs continually; it's not silent.Plastic stencil (name plate) is starting to peel off.The Verdict:If you have a nice shelf to store this on and need to charge a battery in the garage; it will do the job. If you plan on throwing it in the back of your truck on the way to the marina make sure it is in a nice padded case.
4,works fine but ....,"liked the display and push button ease of choosing settingscooked my battery, boiled over leaving sulfuric acid stain on garage floor - no automatic shut down for this event"
2,Charger,"I bought this charger because the advertisement said it would automatically go into charge mode when the AC power was applied. My application was for a remote diesel generator where I powered the charger from the generator output thereby maintaining a battery charge while it was running. However, that turned out to not be the case as I have to go to the generator to enable the charger every time I have a powwer outage."
1,1 BAD CHARGER!!!,"I purchased this charger after trying to get another POWER ON BOARD charger that also had the desulfating feature that worked extremely well but was no longer available at a reasonable cost.This unit will not go into the desulfation mode no matter what I do, I hooked to to a sulfated battery only to return 8 hours later to see the ""green"" maintenance light lit, and the volt meter on 10.2 volts. I have reconditioned batteries over and over with my previous unit and know what to expect. This was a lawn tractor type battery that I have had great success with so far.RUN DON'T ""WALK"" AWAY FROM THIS SCHUMACKER CHARGER!!!"
5,Best Charger I have ever used,"I have been using this charger for about 2 years now and it has never given me any trouble. It will charge any battery i will try it on and once it completes the charge, it monitors the battery level. I would recommend this charger to anyone."
4,time saver,"All of this is available off the web, but do you have the time to spend on collecting the information? I didn't..."
2,Beware of Suggested Age,This product's description says it is recommended for children age 5-8. IT IS TOO SMALL FOR MOST CHILDREN OVER THE AGE OF 4 or 5. My girls are 4 and 5 and I think it's too small for them. I certainly could not see any 7 or 8 year old playing it comfortably. I was highly disappointed.
4,Great Lil Piano!,"This piano is perfect for our petite 3.5 year old and she absolutely adores it! I can easily see her using it for the next couple of years, no prob. In general, the quality is good but I did find a few small chips on some of the the chair legs. One call to Amazon and they rectified the prob. Now the sound is a bit tin-y so if you're looking for grand piano sound keep looking but if you're looking for a starter piano to help encourage your lil one's love of music this is a great choice. One thing that does kinda of bug me is the music sheet holder. Lol with the quality of piano and the age range of the musicians you'd think they'd include a sheet holder with a lip to actually hold the sheet music, but no, no lip so it just falls straight down. Double sided tape to the rescue!"
3,Looks ok and sound is tinny but my 2yr old loves it.,"You are paying mostly for the wood quality of this piano as the sound is like a $30 plastic one. Although I am not personally happy with the overall sound of this piano (its rather poor), the look and finish of the toy is pretty nice and my 2yrs was playing with it instantly and loving every moment. I suppose that's the whole point. The colored notes on the keys is only made of paper and she ripped it off right away. The stand that holds the music is a white plastic stand that comes off easily....too easily if you ask me. There is no lip to hold the music sheet so it keeps falling. That portion of the piano is poorly designed. As I type this, my husband tells me the finish on the piano is ""chipped already""......its been open for an hour. We will keep it but not thrilled with it."
4,Rotating Screen,"This is my 4th Nokia phone, replacing my 6600. The design in quite nice, easy to start the camera (just open the flap and rotate, your camera is ready for a click), It is good as well to have the the screen facing off the phone, and navigate the menu, names. But what I didn't like is that you can't just answer the phone, with one click when the screen facing up!.It is not an easy to handle phone, yet it is loaded with many good features."
1,Terrible picture quality,"DVD's should have a better picture quality then what was shown on this one. This looks like they got a copy of an old VHS tape and converted it to DVD. As far as the movie goes, this was one of Alex O'Loughlin's first movies and he did a great job in it. It's not his fault it wasn't that good."
3,Character Building,"This movie takes place down under of a man who leaves the city to work as a laborer on an Oyster Farm in order to assist his sister in rehabilitation from an accident. The lengths a family member will go to for the medical bills, and also finding love when he least expects it. Alex O'Loughlin is the brother taking care of his sister. He is a fabulous actor no matter what role he plays!"
5,Never knew Oyster Farming could be so fun!,"Great story of a man trying to find his place in the world. Alex O'loughlin is great as is the rest of the cast. If you are looking for action adventure this isn't the movie for you, but if you want a more love story line you will love this movie...The seen with the dog is hilarious .."
5,Great actors and incredible plot makes this movie facinating,"With very talented actors this movie is interesting, with a sad and in the same time funny plot, beautiful shot in Australia with incredible scenery , is a must see movie!"
2,"Alex is hot, enough said","I admit, I bought this movie because of Moonlight's gorgeous main character, Alex O'Loughlin. Not much plot and sort of difficult to follow. Not really a comedy either, but maybe its just ""Australian humour"". If you buy this for the eye candy, good choice; other than that, not much discernable substance."
1,Ridiculous Plot poor acting.... a real fish story,"This was quite unbelievable, rather stupid premise. Uneven acting and poor character development.This movie has very little going for it even the oyster farming was a lame Hollywood contrivance of what really goes on.What ever you do don't buy it...."
2,It was not what I thought it would be.,"I was a little disappointed with this movie. After reading other reviews I thought it would be better.It had moments of funny,but could have done without all of the F-bombs."
1,"""F"" Bombs galore","I was looking forward to this video because it looked like it would be a good movie. I loved Moonlight with Alex Loughlin. I was only able to watch a tiny bit of it because it kept exploding with ""F"" bombs. Oh well, live and learn."
1,What a waste,We were trying to find movies with Alex O'loughlin and there aren't that many. We saw that he could really act in Moonlight but you won't see that in this one. There is a crude scene also that is just something they put in it. Guess they thought it would help. Well it didn't and as a matter of fact it almost turned us off him.
3,Ingredients,Love the product for this stubburn viral chest infection. But they don't list any of the inate ingredients on the packaging nor on the bottle itself. I have allergies and am a bit concerned with not having this information. Any suggestions as to how to obtain it?
4,Good Value,Why make it yourself at this price? Well packaged and it arrived quickly.I will buy it again when the time comes.
5,an amazing message,"this was an enjoyable book,though i've read better. i'm extremely fussy about what i like. however,i give it five stars because of the basic message of the book,which comes up at the very end. i was astounded and gratified at the message that this book puts across."
4,A Wrinkle in Time,"This book is a good, fantasy book. It has a lot of detail and at some points can be confusing but it all makes sense in the end. Like when the kids are off on their own they meet a lot of new people it is very confusing because they are interacting more with their minds and it gets harder to understand. ""Charles Wallace's clear blue eyes focused on the red ones of the man in the chair."" That line from the book is where it get confusing because Charles Wallace is basically being hypnotized by the man and is talking and doing what the man wants him to. Other than that this is a good book about dreams and acheiving them."
5,My Review for A Wrinkle In Time,I really like this book and recomend it to all adults and children who like adventurous or fantasy books. I would read agian any time and think it is worth buying for your own home!
1,A Wrinkle in Time,"The physics of this book is truly embarrasing (totally wrong) and the plot is the most idiotic i have ever heard of. i was truly disappointed with the story. The only thing good about this book is the title, which I suppose comes from a poem."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"For the young teen readers for whom this book was originally written, I suggest, in addition to or in lieu of this book:Flatland (Edwin Abbey): A two-dimensional world whose inhabitants are geometric shapes? It may sound like the geometry lesson from hell, but this delightful novel, now more than 100 years old, is a good introduction to the concept of spatial dimensions.So You Want To Be A Wizard? (Diane Duane): Harry Potter's got nothing on these planet-hopping teenage wizards, who do daily battle with forces of pure evil while attempting to manage their unruly siblings and maintain passing grade.The House with a Clock in its Walls (John Bellairs): Awesomely creepy adventure."
5,On My MUST HAVE List for 15 Years,"My wife read me a short review of this book from a children's catalog and I immediately ordered it. I read it over a weekend as soon as it arrived and spent two years waiting for our eldest child to be old enough that I could read it to her. And three years more until I could read it again to her younger sister. And two more years until I could read it again to our youngest. And each of them spent their allowance money to own their own copy. And went on to give it as a present to special freinds. If you miss this one, it is your own fault. This is one of my (our) all time favorite books. A truly classic tale or good vs evil. A story of immense courage somehow fitting within the frame of a young, near-sighted girl. On my list, it is right up there with Stranger In A Strange Land - the book that made me a reader. One caveat - the evil in this story is truly Evil and may be too intense for younger readers - maybe under 8."
2,A Wrinkle In Time,"I thought this book was interesting. It definitely was very creative, but I liked it because I could relate to the characters. The one I relate to the most was Meg because I sometimes feel like no one likes me and I'm an outcast. I learned from the book that you can make friends even though you feel you're unattractive and not intelligent! So, if you read this book it will definitely have an impact on you."
2,*~ Don't bother ~*,"A Wrinkle In Time wasn't the best book that I've read. And I wouldn't recommend it. Although I didn't like the book, some of the parts were a little good. The story is about a girl named Meg Murry who hasn't seen her father in 2 years. So her, her little brother (Charles Wallace), and a local boy named Calvin go and search for him. They spend most of their time on a planet called Camazotz. On the way there are many obstacles they have to go around. But some of the obstacles they get stuck in and have to make their way out. Overall I didn't really like the book.......but you might."
4,A WRINKLE IN TIME,"I recently read this book for a book report that I was doing for school. I really liked reading this book because it made you think if there was really life on other planets and time traveling through space. If you want to read a good science fiction book, then this is the book for you. I really liked the fact that I could easily picture all the scenes in my head. I didn't like the fact however, that some of the parts were very confusing. That is why I only gave it a 4 out of 5. Meg Murry is a high school student who, along with her little brother Charles Wallace, and their friend Calvin, set off on an adventure with the help of Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which, to find Meg and Charles's dad. Mr. Murry is a scientist who was experimenting with the 5th demention, when he suddendly disapeard. Read this book to find out if the children ever find their father, plus all the adventures they'll go on!"
4,my report,"A Wrinkle In Time is an outstading book for someone who wants to read an action packed book wihtout all the boring details. when it comes to my books i like to get right into the action, and not beet around the bush. Wrinkle In Time jumps right into the action and kept me hoooked. the4 reader will never guess what will happen on the next page; it's filled with a new twist around every corner. this book keeps it short simple and to the action, it is deffenetly worth the time to pick up, and once someone picks it up they won't be able to put it down."
4,More memories...,"About a year ago I saw the movie version of this book and realized, during the movie, that I knew what was going to happen. Not the details, but the general flow of the film. I had dim memories of having heard or seen the book before, somewhere, someplace, and ordered it from Amazon.com - and am so happy I did.It isn't fantasy nor is it Sci-Fi. It seems to touch on the idea of using the fifth dimension to travel in space (and in time) and allows the characters, Meg Murry, Charles Wallace Murry and Calvin O'Keefes, to explore the universe. Well, first they have to rescue Meg's father who has fallen into the hands of the forces of evil.The book was interesting, asking many questions young adults ask themselves and also left me wondering about things. Like what happened to Hank (the first person to mysteriously disappear) and how many other planets are fighting the darkness?Maybe the books that follow this one answer that..."
5,one of my favourite books from my childhood,"I was delighted to be able to find this book again.In my adult life I have often wondered about the ""Tesseract"" and it was great to be able to download and start reading in an instant.However it is def a primary school type children's book - ideally for grade 4 or 5 ( or perhaps 9-11 year old)I still loved it and would recommend if you have children that like science fiction with a bit of mystique."
5,"Review of ""A Wrinkle In Time""","I loved this book because it was a combination of sciencefiction and fantasy, two cool things. My classmates and I even did anonline report on it..."
5,Enduring Excellence,"I first read this in the fifth grade and have reread it almost every year since(and that's been 15+ years). Meg and Charles Wallace are my close friends. The Mrs. W's still make me smile. Ms. L'Engle's masterful writing style is wonderful. She weaves her stories around you with the perfect mix of science, adventure, and even some romance. I highly recommend all of her Time Quartet."
3,a 20th century fairy-tale,"Though this book is generally regarded to be science fiction, I consider it to be more fantasy, in the mode of a folk tale or fairy tale. It plays out classic folklore themes using contemporary American children, rather than misunderstood stepchildren, neglected third sons or witches. If you're looking for classic science fiction, you're bound to be disappointed, because the story is formulaic and too expected. But the characters of Meg and Charles Murry and Calvin O'Keefe are exquisitely drawn, and you will be able to identify completely with these very real children."
4,A Timeless Classic,"This timeless classic will appeal to children, teens, and young adults of all ages, even the young-at-heart. This is one sci-fi fantasy that would help to broaden the horizons of the minds of readers of all ages. It is a heartwarming story of family, friendship and, most importantly of all, love. I enjoyed the variety of elements within (i.e., comedy, drama, mystery, suspense, sci-fi/fantasy, plus a touch of thriller and an eerie sense of horror). It would be nice to see this book be made into a feature film some day."
5,My favorite book of all time,"I first read ""A Wrinkle in Time"" by Madeleine L'Engle when I was in fifth grade, and it has been my favorite book since that time. It has a great message of love, family, and caring for others. My son also read it when he was in fifth grade, and enjoyed it a great deal. I purchased this copy to give to my daughter, who is in fifth grade this year."
5,a classic must-read,"All my friends who read this as children said I had to read it w/my children. They were right! What a gift to share w/the young people in your life! It is great for adults too, btw!"
5,Looking into what was missed,"As a child, I read a lot. Somehow, I didn't read the classics. So, now, I'm going back and reading a lot of what I missed. I've checked out the award sites (Newbery, ABA, etc..) and have compiled a list. A Wrinkle in Time was on that list. I loved it. Now, I'm going to have to go to the library and get the rest of the Time Quartet.I believe most people, children and adults alike, would enjoy this book. It makes you think. It's fun. It makes you want to know what happens next. If you've never read it, take the time and do so. If you have kids, read it to them, you'll both enjoy it.The essay at the end of the book was interesting, as well. Tons of things to think about. I can't wait to find out what happens next!"
3,ONE SERIOUS BOOK,"This book wasn't one that I particularly cared for.Although it was interesting, fantasy such as that does not really appeal to me. What I was most interested in was the mixture of evil,romance,worry,and magic. I would not recommend this book to smaller children such as 10 and under due to the fact that lots of the words in this book are not easy to understand. All and all this book was enjoyable and I think lots of other people should read it."
4,A Wrinkle In Time,"In A Wrinkle In Time, the book was mysterious in ways,yet very serious and dramatic. The book makes you think and wonder if it's really true about Time and other things that involve physics. The book is full of unexpected things. If you like books like this, you should get A Wrinkle in Time. I would recommend it to anyone who would want to read it."
3,A Wrinkle is worth more than a dime,"I thought that a Wrinkle in Time was pretty good. I thought that the ending could have been longer, but for the most part it was good. I think that I would like to read another one of the set of the books. A Wrinkle in Time was very good because it had something new in each chapter. The book had very interesting characters. I also like it because none of the characters were perfect like in some books where theres someone that has a perfect life and theres no problems in the book."
4,A Wrinkle in Time,"A Wrinkle in Time was a very good book. Although it was boring in the begining, it was exciting by the end of the second chapter. It's a book about a young girl who is in need of finding her father. But she finds out that finding her father is harder than she thought. She is making new friends, traveling to other planets, and fighting very evil, powerful foes just to find her beloved father. I recommend it to everyone."
5,A BOOK CAN BE A OLD FRIEND YOU'D LIKE TO REVISIT AGAIN.,"AS A YOUNGSTER I CAME ACROSS THIS VERY INTERESTING BOOK CALLED ""A WRINKLE IN TIME"". AS I READ EACH LINE I FELT COMPELLED TO KEEP READING. ALMOST EACH PAGE HELD NEW AND EXCITING ADVENTURES FOR A SMALL TOWN GIRL LIKE ME. I FOUND MY MINDS EYE CREATING WHOLE SCENCES ACCORDING TO THE DESCRIPTIONS I WAS READING, BLACKENED SKY FULL OF OMINOUS LOOKING CLOUNDS WINDS WHIPPING TOPS OF TREES THROWING IT'S BRANCHES THIS WAY AND THAT WAY! I'M 29 YEARS OLD NOW AND I HAVE NEVER EVER FORGOTTON THE BOOK ""A WRINKLE IN TIME"" IT IS LIKE AN OLD FRIEND THAT I KNEW MANY YEARS AGO THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ONCE AGAIN REVISIT"
4,"Great story, but ended too soon","The story was a great read, but just when it seemed like all the characters had been set up, the story finishes off. Maybe the other stories in the time series will expand on this - I haven't looked at them yet."
5,Awesome Book,This book was amazing and I can't wait for the next books I hope a lot of people read this book I would reccomend this book to sci-fi lovers
5,Really awesome book!!!,This was a very imaginative book. When I read it I felt very much in the world of Meg. I couldn't stop reading it! I enjoyed it the whole way through! ...It was like eating a delicious piece of chocolate cake!Read this book! ...you'll love it!-Domino
5,wow! i loved it,"What a cool book!!!! Loved it! next, look 4 A Wind In The Door. it's second in the series with only one after it. If you like 1. magic 2.family stories 3.some reality and 4. the greatest books you'll love it. at my school lots of kids are reading it and getting the 2nd one afterward."
4,A Wrinkle in Time Review,"The Murrys are often gossiped about since the disappearance of Mr.Murry whom disappeared when Charels Wallace was just a baby (Charles Wallace is the youngest of four children).Charels Wallace is a unique boy and many people think he is a dumb and never learned how to talk when he is really in a way a genius .Margret Murry (Meg) is Charles Wallace's older sister and is the youngest of the four Murry children. Meg is doing poorly in school and is upset because of her ""plainness"". Eventually Charles Wallace,Meg and Calvin O'Keefe go on a crazy galactic adventure with the help of Mrs.Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which and their ability to tesser.A Wrinkle in Time is an exciting and creative story that definitely deserves the Newbery Medal. The only problems in the story were that some of the characters were hard to believe and a few things were hard to understand but all in all it was a great book.6th grader from WI"
1,A Review of A Wrinkle in Time!,"I really didn't like the book that much. I would recommend it to an adult, but not to a child. It was somewhat slow in the begining but it became a little better. I would not ever read it again. I hope my little sisters don't ever have to read this."
1,I don't like it,"My daughter had to read it for her English class, so I had to help her.My daughter says the book was ""suffocating"". The book seems to be a good book, but the truth is that it's boring. Probably in the 60's the story was new and exciting, not in modern days. The book has ridiculous arguments in some parts, problems that don't make sense, which make the book boring."
1,False Advertising,"This is one book titled as a Quintet. It leads one to believe, once it is purchased, that there are 5 books that have been purchased. What has been purchased is one book, the first of five. If you were to purchase a quintet at a bookstore, you would be able to see what you are getting, 5 books. That can not be done with books purchased at Amazon for a Kindle. Amazon would not take responsibility for the way this is titled. (A Wrinkle in Time ""Madeleine L'Engle's Time Quintet"") They said the publisher titled it this way. So, Amazon should be responsible for the product they sell. Since I told them about this problem, 1 1/2 weeks ago, they have not changed the title. There are going to be some disappointed customers, of which I am one."
1,This is the worst book I have ever read.,I hated this book. It is a very confusing notfake plot of a book. Don't waste your money.
1,UGH!,I really hate this book. I have no idea how it ever became so popular. It was pure torture reading it. The characters are undeveloped and unbelievable. The weird flying rainbow aliens and the brain made me feel as if I'd tumbled into an LSD hallucination.
2,A Wrinkle In Time was not that good,"It's not that A Wrinkle In Time was bad, I just don't get into books like that. It had some confusing parts, but towards the end it cleared up. The book had a lot of comlicated words, a little too complicated for me. But overall the book was ok. I dont think I would read it agaim."
2,Not sure why this is considered so great,"Maybe it's simply that the book can not compare to more modern children's literature, but I'm not sure why this is considered such a classic book. I found the book to be a little strange and meandering. I found the characters to be rather flat and uninteresting. The story seemed to wander with no real focus until the very end, and that part was fairly predictable.My daughter loved the book though, so maybe I'm just too old to appreciate it."
2,Two Stars for A Wrinkle In Time,"Reviewed by middle school students.The beginning of the book started off slow and boring. It was hard to get into, however it became more interesting near the end when more action was happening. It was not a book that we would read again, because it was strange and hard to follow. There is no explanation for the ending the characters just poof magically back to their garden. The reader is left with a lot of unanswered questions. Maybe there are answers in the sequals."
5,Awesome,"It arrived in good time, in great condition, and I love the book, so really there's no downside to this purchase. Very pleased."
2,A Wrinkle in Time,"K: I seriously did NOT like this book. E: Why?K: I didn't like it because I read it 2 times before and it was sort of hard to get into it. Did you like it, E? E: It was ok. It was hard to understand, and it was too much of a fantasy type of book for me. Both: We gave it 2 stars because one of us sort of liked it and the other didn't!"
3,Boring and short.,"The book was ok, but it could be better if she wrote more for the end. The book was boring because it was too sad. Meg keep crying and thge boy acted stupid so no one would talk about him. Also the book had very little action. Another thing is the end does not explain what happened."
3,A really wrinkly book review,A Wrinkle In Time is a strange book about a lonesome ugly girl. She goes on a journey to save her father from the dark thing(a representation of evil). She tessers all over the cosmos(tessering is the process by which you wrinkle the distance between you and a destination). We like this book because it has lots of adventure and action. We disliked this book because it didn't have a very good ending and a slow beginning.
3,A WRINKLE IN TIME Review,"The book A Wrinkle In Time was OK. It had some exciting parts,but some boring ones, too. We think that IT should have died. It ended too fast. The author should have told more about what happened to the Mrs. Ws. What we liked about the novel was the creativity. Some parts seemed too made up, but basically the whole book was good."
4,A Wrinkle In Time,"This book is very good. A girl named Madeline, hermisunderstood little brother named Charles, and a local kid namedCalvin have to save Charles' and Madeline's Father from ""The dark thing"". It is an excellent example of what human nature could be and I think that more people should read this (with an open mind) and they could learn many things about what human nature could be. I think that all kids should read this book at least once and maybe we might have a brighter future."
2,Not a favorite,"My son loves to read, but getting him to read this book was like pulling teeth. He told me how awful it was all the way through and then at the end acted really excited about the book . I think that he may have been excited to be done."
5,Awesome book!,This was the best book I have ever read! I really liked the ending. I recommend the book for all genders and for children over 8.
3,For the Young,"Even though the book is well known, I find the story too simple and in a way too original, it radiates the same message as any childrens book today. I would only recommend this book to children under 12 years of age, for the book will not catch the readers imagination at an older age."
5,A Wrinkle in Time,"I have never read this classic and our friends had a Library theme for their wedding reception because the groom is a Library Science Major. Each table represented a classic book and the table I was assigned to had ""A Wrinkle"" as the theme. Well I took it as a message to read it. I loved it!! All I can say is it is very ""right on"" to what is currently happening in our world."
3,A Childhood must,Sci fi is not my favorite genre but this book is a well crafted childhood gem. It recaptured the lost imagination.
4,A good book,"""It was a dark and stormy night,"" that's how A Wrinkle in Time, by Madeleine L'Engle all begins. Meg, Charles Wallace, Calvin, and their good friends Mrs. Who, Mrs. Which, and Mrs. Who, are taken to many strange places throughout the galaxy. They are tessered, which is a transport through time and space. These three friends are being prepared for what they face on Camazotz, where Meg's dad is. Will they all serve IT, or will they save Mr. Murry? Read this book to find out.This book I recommend, and it deserves a good rating. I recommend this book for ages 13 or over. The math is very complicated. I barely understood it. The younger kids might lose interest half- way through. A Wrinkle in Time, by me, gets 4 1/2 stars. The only two things that are wrong are Meg's clueless state, and impatience. Other then those, A Wrinkle in Time was a really good book. By Greg Fisher, age 13."
3,A Wrinkle in Time: Adventure Around Every Corner,"A Wrinkle in Time: Adventure Around Every Corner""She screamed, `Charles!' The word was flung down her throat.She was completely alone.""This is just the beginning of Meg's adventures. A Wrinkle in Time is a book about Meg and some of her friends on a quest to rescue her long lost father. Meg's mom has asked where he is, but the government only says he's on a dangerous mission. Meg's principal thinks he's dead.In the very beginning, a mysterious stranger comes into the house while Meg, her mom, and her little brother Charles Wallace are munching on midnight snacks. Who is that stranger, and what does that stranger want?To find out, join in on the action with Meg on a breathtaking adventure!"
4,A Wrinkle In Time-Alex,"Imagine feeling a large jerk and then suddenly appearing on a different planet. That happens to Meg, Charles, and Calvin as they go on their quest to fight the evil IT in Madeline L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time. As Meg, Charles, and Calvin travel to many different planets a main theme emerges: good vs. evil. If you like science fiction and fantasy this book is for you but if it doesn't sound appealing to you, you might try other books by Madeline L'Engle like A Wind in the Door, Many Waters, and A Swiftly Tilting Planet."
4,A Wrinkle in Time- Samantha,"Have you ever tried to tesser before? Meg and Charles Wallace did several times when they went to save their father. Meg and Charles Wallace with the help of some newfriends tesser off to a strange planet where they find danger everywhere. There they have to help themselves by using strange gifts and courage inside themselves. This exciting adventure/science fiction story is exciting as the characters battle evil forces, fight for each other's lives and try to go within themselves to find hope. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy science fiction."
2,Meh.,"From all the glowing reviews of this book, I really expected better. I certainly did not expect a repetitive, outre praising of the Christian god throughout an award-winning children's speculative fiction book. That really turned me off of what was otherwise a perfectly serviceable read, even if it was a simplistic plot and had annoying characters. I can only expect more 'god' references in the rest of the series, and for that reason, I will not bother to read them."
3,A Wrinkle In Time,Book was ordered for my older grandsonand he likes it. I haven't read it soI'm not sure how well a read it is.Condition of book is OK and it arrivedin the time promised.
2,Below average,"I am a reading teacher and I have a list of books that the grade should read. This book is on the list so we have been reading it. I try to mask my negative feelings about this book. I had to force myself to finish it. It's boring and has many unanswered questions. The ending is just uneventful. Many students in my class hate this book, but I pretend it's very good and we have to finish it."
1,i hate this book,I didnt like this book because it was boring. I thought that it was boring because it didnt make any sense to me because it would be talking about one thing and then it would talk about something else. I would have liked it more if it would have had more exciting and had more action. I don't like books like this; they are boring. The ending was the best part.
1,My Opinion,"this book was good. but i wouldn't reccomend it to everyone. it was boring and confusing. you'll definitly like this book if u like science fiction, and your a VERY good reader. try to take it slow........because if u dont you'll get confused.(very easily!)"
3,a wrinkler in time,I think that A Wrinkle In Time was a good book . It was suspenseful but wasn't very exciting. There was a character named IT which was all mighty and powerful and a girl that was about 13 had to fight IT to save her brother. This story is about going through time to defeat evil. After all the book made sense at the end but not while you are reading it.
3,A Boring Book,"I had to read this book for school and no one in my class liked it. Every one thought it was a boring book. It goes on, and on and the stuff it goes on and on about are the most boring things ever. I think the chapters were way to long and some parts I didn't understand and some of the words I have never heard of. I don't recomend this book for anyone that is not a good reader. Ever though this book has bad points to it, it was also very interesing at some parts and thoughs parts I enjoyed a little. ..."
3,Flirts with greatness but just too......,"This book is too much like a battle against communism--a child's version of 1984 and Bedknobs and Broomsticks. It is not for the non-religious parent either. For my part, I felt it left too many details obscure and yet was too direct with others: things that are (religion, the nature of the universe, etc) generally heavy subjects for children to be good for a wide audience of kids. These are things in my opinion that are very private. The books in very determined to take only a certain view of the world, religion, and the matter of the universe, etc, that I shrank from reading the entire thing to my child. We had to talk about way to much about the assumptions and assertions being made and whether they were the only way to view how ""things are."" The book is already too random and overcomplicated in its general oddity and weirdness to also take on these things for children under 12, at least."
1,It was TERRIBLE!!!,"I had to read this book over the summer when i was going into 6th grade. It completly ruined my summer! It was an awful book, which i hated. It had a plot, but one that was horrible. A sci-fi book is a waste of time!!!"
1,thorough disappointment,"Muddled science, religious indoctrination, andcardboard characters--that's a lot to fit intoa single volume. Parents who wish to steer theirchildren away from the world of ideas could do nobetter than to buy this book."
2,Not a Fighter,"I re-read this book from my childhood and I'm very disappointed with particular messages Madeleine presents to children. I think enough has been said about stars (angels?) being conceived as witches to ""play a joke"" on everyone and the centaur appearance of the other ""angels"". No matter what the rest of the story conveys, I am completely revulsed by the notion she presents that Jesus was a fighter. He is not a fighter, but represents peace & love spreading the word of the Father on this earth for all to follow. Also, Jesus has already won the battle for us. All of these ignorant statements in this book by Madeleine need to be pulled before I will even think about looking at this book or sharing it with others."
5,It Brings Back Your Imaganation!,"When I was around the age of eight, I believed fairies lived all over the world. After about a year or so, fairies didn't seem that believe-able anymore. But then for my 10th birthday, My Dad's old highschool friend sent me ""A Wrinkle In Time,"" I read this book, and found it very good. 'A Wrinkle in Time' brings back what you used to not believe in. I would recemend this book to children and adults. I think anybody who read this book who find it well written!"
5,"Even with wrinkled pages, this is a great book!","This book is truly timeless. Madeleine L'Engle brilliantly weaves physics and philosophy into a sci-fi/fantasy story that all ages can enjoy.Meg, a teenage girl, along with her 5-year-old brother Charles Wallace and schoolmate Calvin, travel through time, space, and dimensions to rescue Meg's father, who has been on a secret mission and hasn't been heard from in over a year. They meet magnificent creatures and visit distant lands, and must use their intelligence, courage, and love to find their father.This is a book that will be especially appreciated by kids up to age 15 or so, although I still love it as an adult and read it to my own children, who at ages 4 and 6 thoroughly enjoyed it.Sidenote:I was troubled to find out that this book has been banned by certain schools for religious reasons, go figure."
4,A Wrinkle in Time is saved by Devine Inspiration,"A Wrinkle in Time is a great book for sci-fi fans. It was an enjoyable book and it full of action mixed with science and a great plot behind it all. The story is told in third person, following the main character, Meg, through time and space on her journey to help find her father and ends up trying to save the world from an evil ""darkness."" A Wrinkle in Time is a fun story and I enjoyed its suspense and loved the characters. This would be the first book that I would recommend to someone who is looking for a good fiction book to read."
5,good book,"I really liked this book.............Although the beggining was kind of slow......But, by the mddle of the book, I was really really into the book.........I hope more ppl will read the book, TRUST meyou won't regret it..."
5,Magical,"I remembered this book from when I was young, I am so glad I did. It was required reading in elementary school. I ended up loving it, so much that I read the other 2 books in the series as well. On my own, not required for school. I used to fail english as a kid. Then I read this book, and I realize as I sat to read it again, as an adult, that this book nurtured my love of reading."
2,Good message but bad story,"Sure, it conveys a solid message...love people, be happy about being an individual...but the story was just bad. I didn't like any characters and everything just felt rushed along. It's almost as if this could have been a solid 500-600 page book and the editor told the author to make it 230 pages instead...which left just a bad story overall. Not a fan."
3,A Book Review For A Wrinkle In Time,"I liked the book because it's a classic and I think other people should read it too. I also like it because it has adventure. But there are other books for my age group that are better. The main characters are Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin.One day Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin go into an alternate universe to find Meg's dad. They also encounter aliens on the way of their journey."
5,I think that it was the best book I have ever read.,"It is tyhe best book because of the way Mrs.Whatsit morphed into the beautifull animal. I just think that it was the best book I have ever read.My favourite person was Meg Murry and Aunt Beast. I olso liked Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which. And I also loved the way the author rote this magnificent book."
5,Great book!,"This has been one of my favorite books for a long time. One of the reasons I like it because it actually makes you think unlike alot of useless books out there. The imaginative picture it gives you is wonderful. If you like this book you should definately read the sequels ""A Wind in the Door"",""A Swiftly Tilting Planet"", and ""Many Waters""."
5,The Best Book!,I read this book a while ago because of a request from my friend at 13. Its only been a year and have read it aat least 5 times. I loved this book becuase it is very interesting and fun to read. Its definitly one of my favorites!
4,What a fun book to read!,"I never had the opportunity to read this book as a child but chose it for a college course reading assignment. What a pleasant surprise! The fast action grabs your attention and holds it to the very end. While joining in the adventure with Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin the reader discovers the real reason for the disapperance of their father."
4,A wonderful journey through time and space!!,"Readers will love this journey through not only time and space, but good and evil. After being visited by a misplaced messanger who tells Meg and her little brother Charles Wallace that their is such a thing as a ""tesseract"" or a wrinkle in time, they along with their neighbor Calvin O'Keefe set out to find Meg and Charles Wallace's father, who studied time travel. These three along with Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which take on a planet that is controlled by ""IT"", a brain that represents the forces of evil. This is a tantilizing tale that is sure to keep you reading on to the next chapter."
5,"A Fun, Easy Read","Somehow this book slipped through the required reading list in my school days, and that was entirely my loss. I'm a 36 years young homemaker who needed to read something fun without pages of character development. While surfing through books at Amazon.com I remembered I had never read this book and had heard that it was very good. I liked the idea that it was written for a young audience. I happen to be very young at heart so this book was right up my alley.I am very glad I have read this book. I intend to buy the three sequels too. I like how the story starts right away. I identify with Meg. One of the themes in the book is accepting who you are and taking the bad with the good. I like how Meg's impatient and stubborn nature was looked at as two good qualities to have.Children of all ages will enjoy this book and get a lot out of it. I highly recommend it."
4,A Wrinkle in Time,"My mother gave me this book when I was younger to preoccupy myself. I loved it then, and I love it now. I still find myself picking it up for a quick read some days. I just bought this book for my roommate so that she could enjoy it as well, and she did. My point is, this book isn't just for kids, but adults as well! It's a great book."
5,Wrinkle in time,This was such a good book...I loved it so much.Meg was a really good character in the book.
3,Interesting concept,I thought this theme was interesting. It reminded me of the evil that we see around us in this age. And then there's always the conflict that we have as children wondering if our parents did the best they could. Very interesting.
3,"""ok"" book","A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle had a great beginning. The first sentence starts out with ""It was a dark and stormy night........."" I think that is a great way to start out the story. In my view, the characters do not develop a well as I would of hoped they would as the story went along. I kind of got lost as I read the story, but that might just be me and not the books fault. But it might have been the reason. I found this book to give a good story but not as well as I pictured it when I first saw it. Overall, it might be a good kids book, but not for me...."
2,A Wrinkle in Time,"The book A Wrinkle in Time, is a ok book. It wasnt the greatest because it was boring at some long parts. The imagination was just amazing that they could come up with this stuff!Its about these 3 kids that are trying to find they're dad on a different planet. They have to tesserect to get there though. They have to go through all of these mean brainwashed aliens. They have to battle a ugly brain that is trying to brainwash them! I really like when she meets this thing that she calls aunt beast. Aunt beast has tentecles and fur, very good smelling and soft fur. I recommened this book to people that love to read and can sit through a loooonnggg book."
5,This book changed my life!,"First off, I am 26 years old and still moved by this book, along with the other companion booksA Wind in the DoorandA Swiftly Tilting Planet. I actually re-read it yesterday, for the 4th time in my life and it still affects me the way it did when I first read it, back in the 5th grade. I actually hated reading until my 5th grade teacher (Ms. Cantor, thank you!) introduced us to this book and I was hooked! My love for reading all started with this one.I am just so amazed and inspired by this book, and am so curious to know where Ms. L'Engle (RIP) got her inspiration from; it's as if she were there herself.If you've never read this book, give it a try, no matter what age you are. I'm sure Ms. L'Engle is now a star, singing the song of the universe! Bottom line, her words just make me feel connected to everything and everyone, and I truly appreciate her contribution to us."
3,A Wrinkle In Time,"I purchased the audio of A Wrinkle In Time for my classroom - I use it for my special needs students and also for students who have missed class while we read together (it is a quick way to catch up). I was excited to hear Madeline L'Engle read the story, but my students found her voice a bit tedious. My colleague and I have used this story as a science fiction genre unit for several years - the students love it!"
4,An Enjoyable Book,"Madeline L'engle does a creative job of writing ""A Wrinkle in Time"". I recommend this book to anybody. My favorite part of the book is when Meg,the main character,and the rest of her group meet the strange beasts of Ixchel. ""A Wrinkle in Time"" brings new meaning to science fiction ."
4,a wrinkle in time review,This book was an awesome book! It was a short and simple book. It taught you that if you have love you can conquer evil. I liked that the ending was left as a mystery. Also how it taught you the moral dont't judge a book by its cover because somebody can be really sweet on the inside and can be really ugly on the outside. It was a book I would recommend for anyone who has an imagination.
5,My favorite book!,"I absolutely adore this book! Having first read it at age 10, I have re-read it countless times since. L'Engle provides a wonderful story, with loveable and sympathetic characters. The book is amazingly detailed, yet is an easy and flowing read.As a teenager, I was able to relate to Meg's sense of not fitting in with the rest of her classmates. Her character sums up the awkwardness that being an adolescent brings. However, by the end of the book, Meg is greatly changed by her adventures, and is clearly more comfortable with herself.This book has many important themes, such as love, acceptance, and the triumph of good over evil. The story is both touching and interesting, especially good for those who enjoy science fiction (though others will like it as well!)."
5,I taught it every year for 20 years - love it!,"This book has become the one that I look forward to teaching every year. The students are introduced to the characters that appear in every chapter and we keep a ""supernaturility chart"" where we rank them. Chapter by chapter we follow Meg and co. in search of her father and learn about dimensions and time. (Einstein would have loved this book.) After we finish the book, we make an oversized comic strip and plaster it all over the classroom. Almost without exception, my students love this book."
2,"Rambling, Vague and Uninteresting","My wife is a sixth-grade teacher and has taught this book for many years. She'd told me that I'd like it and so finally my daughter and I read it at the same time as part of a class project.I found it to be rambling and vague at its worst and uninteresting at its best.Intellectually, I understand its appeal and educational value. I thought my daughter might connect with the main character, Meg, but there was nothing there for her. I do, however, understand why Meg would be a draw for some children. For the purposes of an educational exercise, the book is full of symbolism and solid characterization.For adults, it's a quick read, but start with tempered expectations."
2,A WRINKLE IN TIME,"I think that this book was a very good book,and if you want something that throws you of the story,but you still understand it,this is the right book for u.This book written by Madeleine L'engle called""A Wrinkle In Time""is about a young girl named Meg trying to have everything perfect but she is always scared.Meg tries to rescue her dad,and when they forget her brother Charles Wallace in Camazot,she tries anything to get him back from IT.IT is a part of a person but I wont say what.Anothe rcharacter is The Man With Red Eyes who hypnotizes people for IT.Mrs.Who,Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs.Which are two people that Calvin,Meg,and Charles will not find out if they are their friends or enemies."
2,"TERRIBLE, LACK OF ALMOST EVERYTHING","A terrbile book. I gave it two stars because the plot was great. Otherwise it was a bad bad book. The author needs to sharpen her sense of writing. The way she writes makes me bored out of my MIND. But she definetely can write a plot, that is very interesting."
2,Over-rated,"This is the type of book that I usually love and I had high hopes for it after the first few pages. Unfortunately, it never fulfilled its promise. The characters do not develop. They emerge fully developed as you first meet them and do not grow or change. There is a great deal of dialogue that is repetitive and, ultimately, tedious. The book does not truly explore the issues it is concerned with, instead the ideas whirl around aimlessly. I believe in the transforming power of faith and love, but this book leaves me unconvinced that this power exists. There is minimal action, which would be fine if there were character or thematic development.Try Diana Wynne Jones instead. She almost always does this much better.Or try Terry Pratchett's Tiffany Aching series (The Wee Free Men starts the series) for a humorous take on some similar issues regarding a young woman finding her place in the world."
2,Fantsy Wondery,"This book is a great fantasy book. I thought I didn't like fantasy, but this book has changed my perspective. So just try it,it is great!!!!"
5,A Wrinkle in Time RROOCCKKSS!!,"This is a very astounding book in the way that it starts off making you think it's going to be a boring book about a girl who thinks she's stupid. Instead, it takes you into the magical world of combined science fiction and fantasy. If you like science fiction or fantasy, READ THIS BOOK!!!!!! It is a big book on how love is an unknown power, and how love can save what weapons can not. If you believe you can love, this is a good book for you. At some parts it's romantic and even sad. So, if you like incredibly touching stories, this is the right novel. I think that it rocks. I guarantee a good read.- Missy Critic"
2,Not Loan-able?,"not being able to loan the KINDLE version of this book is asinine! I purchased this book for my daughter to enlighten her love of books by introducing one of my favorite authors. She was so enchanted by the series, she wanted to share this one with a friend to enlighten HER love of books...Good books are for sharing with good friends to create Great communities! Pass it on!"
1,HORRIBLE !!,Our whole seventh grade class had to read this. I couldn't have hated it more! I didn't understand a lot of the story. Ms. L'Engle did a terrible job of trying to explain the tesseract. Myself and the whole class were so confuSed !!!!! Even the teacher said that she thoguht the book was a waste of time. I don't recommend it.
1,Review for the AUDIO BOOK,"My review is for the AUDIO BOOK not the real book. I have not even read the real book.I got the AUDIO BOOK and began listening. The AUDIO BOOK is read by the author. I can't believe the editor would allow her to read her book. She has one of the worst voices for reading I have heard. Raspy, like she has smoked too much and angry like she's pissed off at the world. She shouts! (She sounds, in fact, like Hilary Clinton screaming and I'm not kidding)I will read this book myself because I love a good fantasy but I would caution you to listen to an example of the AUDIO BOOK before getting it. I don't understand how anyone, but especially the editor, could have allowed this woman to presume she had any talent for reading. Yes, it is that bad. Voice acting is a real skill best handled by trained actors.Better check it out for yourself before laying out any money for the AUDIO BOOK. As for the real book, I'll be picking it up soon and reading it to myself."
1,Umm... Don't bother,"All I can say is: this book is bizzare. In my opion, it was too new age and somewhat occultic. It was just not worth reading"
1,This is a horrible book,"My mom had been convincing me to read this book for the past few years, and I finally agreed to read it. IT WAS HORRIBLE! I don't understand at all how some people like it. I think the plot is silly and the entire story is pointless."
2,Quick Ending Spoils Book,"Quick Ending Spoils BookA Wrinkle in Time was enjoyable to readbecause it was exciting and adventurous. Thebook could be considered both science fictionand mystery. I enjoyed this book because thethree main characters in the book were tryingto reach what seemed to be an unattainablegoal. They managed to achieve their goal byusing three important qualities, teamwork,hard work, and most importantly love.Unfortunately, the ending in this bookwas not what the reader would have expected.The book came to a sudden end without any ofthe adventure or excitement which came beforeit. The disappointing ending makes this bookdifficult for me to recommend."
1,"Wonderful Book, Terrible Reading","This was one of my favorite books as a child. The book holds up, but this recorded version is just terrible. As noted by the other reviewers, the author's less-than-sophisticated accent, utter lack of acting skill, and odd speech issues really take away from the experience. She speaks as if she's clenching her teeth on all the ""s""s, giving the impression of always talking with a mouthful of spit. Some books are described as ""unreadable""; I'd describe this recording as ""unlistenable"". The story is still wonderful, though, so if you want to hear it aloud, try a different edition."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME!I could not put this book down! This book is full of suspense and fun. I really enjoyed it. It was extremely creative and is a book for a person with lots of imagination. If someone asked me about this book I would highly recommend it. The story has a setting that is all over the universe. Truly this is an amazing book!
4,"We won, get over it","It's shocking to reread this book as an adult and realize how Cold War it is. It's almost an anticommunist diatribe, and in this day and age it certainly wouldn't be winning any awards for anything. It's also too Jesus-y for me, but that makes sense when you realize it was written in the McCarthy era: Fear God and hate communists. If you're buying a book for a kid, look for something more contemporary and less all-American."
3,Not a favorite,"Despite the O.K writing style, the fantasy is something that seems less attractive then space exploration or middle earth. The ideas are somewhat fresh but the one thing that irks me are the characters. The main character is rather borring and unintresting,along with her mediocre companions. I read this in grade five and and it still leavs a sour note in my head every time I look at it. I would not make a child read it, unless they wanted too by themselves."
4,great read,I enjoyed this book as a child and am happy to pass it on to someone younger. It made a great gift for a student reading in the upper elementary school level.
5,The Fairy Tale of all Time,"This book is a classic of children's literature which, like all classic fairy tales, expresses the struggle between good and evil. Madeleine L'Engle's passion for science provides the backdrop for the tale as the children and their mentors fly off in a Tesseract to find their missing physicist father.The earth is a shadowed planet, and the task for Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin is to change the world to one that is fit for human beings not automatons and power-mongers. This is an exquisite book that should be cherished and on the shelves of every family in America."
3,"It was a good book,","A Wrinkle in Time is a great book by Madeleine L'engle. It is about a young girl named Meg Murry, her younger brother Charles Wallace and her friend Calivin O'Keefe. Meg and her brother are hoping for their father to come back. He was a scientist playing with the 5th dimension when he disappeared into space. See how Meg, Calvin, Charles Wallace, Mrs. Who, Mrs Whatsit, and Mrs. Which (three people they meet on the way)outwit the forces of evil to find Meg and Charles Wallace's father. Read this book to find out what happenes. I recommened this book for all ages."
3,A Wrinkle In Time,"This is a story of three children: Meg Murry, her younger brother Charles Wallace, and Calvin O'Keefe (a popular athlete at Meg's school). With the assistance of, Mrs. Who, Mrs. Which, and Mrs. Whatsit,three mysterious ladies, go on an adventure to find Meg's father. Who disappeared while exploring the tesseract-a wrinkle in time. The children travel to the planet Camazotz, with the help of the three Mrs.W's. Here they encounter a zombie like population controlled by a disembodied brain IT. With the help of the three ladies and their gifts Meg explores the potentially destructive force of intelligence, and the power of human love to overcome this force. Charles Wallace is taken over by IT, and Meg finds that her love is the only thing to set him free. After this the three children and their father go home to be with the rest of the family."
2,Liberal propaganda,"The author uses this ""children's story,"" as a platform for her liberal religous and social beliefs. The children travel through time and space to a land where people are brainwashed zombies and ""big brother""-in other words the government-is watching them. During their journey the children discover that Jesus, Buddha and Kermit The Frog are all really the same thing and everyone should hold hands and skip through a field of flowers. The thing that bothered me about this story was that the author had an agenda and was very transparent about it. To me the story lacked originality and it was just a voicepiece for this women to air her opinions."
1,Unimaginative,"I am pronely the only person in the world, who does not like this book. I found it very boring and the characters un real. The writer did not hold my interest. I got the entire set of this series when I was a kid and was very disappointed with it."
2,What!!!!?????,This book just about drove me crazy! I don't think I still know what is going on and what it was all about! Will not read it again ever! And will not suggest it to anyone!
1,Veiled religious dogma,"I was enjoying this book until the religious themes began popping up. I would not have minded them if they had fit the story line but they felt forced to me. The book kept setting me up for exciting discoveries only to let me down by declarations of angels, love and evil is female. I came away resenting what I felt was religious doggery and with the message that all evil is feminine. A very sexist book is this one."
1,YAWWWWNNNNNNNNNN!,"Blah blah blah who cares. Ugh, I didnt give a hoot if they [the main charcters] died or not. The villian: a brain and a cloud. Oh wow, nobody can beat that! Cheese,I could have written a better book. Mrs. L'Engle if your gonna write anymore books please dont write them like this horrible peice of liturature. I can't imagine what the newberry awards people were thinking when the gave this book its reward."
1,SO boring!!!,"This book is not worth reading @ all! I got this thinking it would be a really good book, since alot of the people I knew had read it & said it was okay. I got a couple pages into this & it didn't make any sense even then. I was bored out of my mind, but I just kept reading. Slowly, of course. I wanted to finish, but about 1/3 through it, I couldn't take it any more. It was getting to boring, WAY to boring. Don't read this book. Read some thing else, any thing but this."
1,One less thing to worry about,"If you like amateurish prose and ""special"" children, this is the book for you. My 7-year-old kid read it and hated it. Thank goodness. I worry about this kid. Will he marry the wrong girl? Will he get a job he doesn't like? Will he waste his life reading bad books like _A Wrinkle in Time_? Now I have one less thing to worry about."
4,Kids Pleased; Dad Baffled,"I read this to my young children. They loved it. They loved the drama and tension, and appreciated the characters. I was interested in the book and ""how it was going to turn out,"" but I have one gnawing problem; I don't understand this book. There are some heavy Christian Biblical references (much appreciated), but this is all juxtaposed with a world of ""witches,"" spooky but loving aliens, clairvoyent children, and other things not discussed in Sunday School. It does not have to be understood to be enjoyed (unlike, say, Shakespeare). My kids were gripped right from the mysterious but oddly charming opening scene in the kitchen. Even from just looking around on this product page, one can see that the book has many fans and that it has been taken apart and ""understood"" by others; maybe I'll get to that someday. For now, I'll just recommend it to your list of books to share with your kids."
2,The classic story is unevenly read by the author,"What must be considered one of the great children's classics is performed on audio cassette by the author. Ms. L'Engle has a lisp which makes listening to the story difficult at best. The author's reading is also uneven, which stands in the way of enjoying this great classic piece of children's literature."
4,Gripping from start to finish,"A wrinkle in Time is a story about Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace. In this story they, they ""tesser"" through time and space, to fight the evil black thing called ""IT"", and save Charles Wallace and Meg's fathr.This is a great book because the action never stops. Meg's emotions are powerful and real. Madeline L'Engle does a wonderful job creating pictures in your mind.-H.J."
5,Amazing and Understandable,I would truely recommed this book to a lot of people I know.A wrinkle in time expresses the feeling of Meg Murry in an amazing way.This is also the way many people would feel if they read this.The book is about 3 children who have to understand there background.That is why I gave this book five stars.If I could give it anymore trust me I would.
5,A great tale of three children's jorney threw time and space,"I am in sixth grade and just recently read this book. It tells of three childrens journey threw as I said Time and Space. You can defeat the laws of gravity as you Journey with: Meg Murry, Charles Wallece Murry And Calvin O'Keefe along with the wonderful Mrs. Who, Mrs. Which, And mrs. Whatsit! As they journey to several different planets and Galexseies for that mater in a desperate strugle to save Mr. Murry! Will they make back to Earth in time or will the be lost in space and time forever? You'll find out when you read a WRINKLE IN TIME!!!!!!!"
4,This book is very complicated.,"I think that A Wrinle In Time is a very complicated book and unless you like a callenge I wouldn't recomend this book. If you think you would like this book, and dissid to read it you will be pulled into it and after your finished with it I am confident that you will want to read it again. I think tha disscription the author used to discribe Meg, her father, and all the other charecters is amazing. You would need to now about science and dimensions to understand this book."
5,A true blue fan of the Murrys,"I have all for of the books about the Murry family. I'm in the middle of ""Planet"" and I just have to say I love these books so dearly. I beleive in tesseracts (sort of). I am eager to finish the rest of the boo and then ""Waters"". I want to read the biography of Ms. L'Engle and hope I persuade many more to. I just can't get over it. I love fantasy but always protest against sci-fi, unless it's like this, baby!"
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I'd like to say that this is one of the best books I ever read! I read it in the fourth grade and finished it within 5 days. This is a good book for kids in middle school. I liked it and I hope you do to!
4,a time to dream together,this was a great read with my 2 girls...we could not wait to get to the 'next section'...so much creativity. What is real? And who do you trust? Are things what they seem?
5,a wrinkle in time- Maddie J.,"A wrinkle in time, Madeleine L'Engle-Meg Murry is a smart girl, but has trouble applying her self in school. Her constant getting in trouble is hard on her mother who has difficulty coping with the disappearance of her husband. When they are visited by three strangers that appear one night. Now Meg, her new friend Calvin, her little brother Charles Wallace, and these three strangers must embark on a larger-than-life expedition to find Megs father.A wrinkle in time is a magnificent tale of an ordinary girl with a very unordinary life. Whether you are frequently sitting down with a good paperback, or can't remember the last time you red a book all the way through, I guarantee you will fall in love with this story. Great for an adult, adolescent, or if you can't even read yet, this is one first-rate book."
4,Fascinating to hear!,"I was so pleased to see this out on CD- I'm looking forward to the other books in the series! This is a reading by the actual author, which is fascinating. She starts off a little rocky, and it retains a feel of mom reading you the story (as opposed to a dramatization), but I love having the nuances the author intended communicated this way. Ms. L'Engle's voice does not record very cleanly- the recording seems to lisp, and when I heard her speak live, I did not notice this- but it is still clear, and gets more so as the recording progresses. I recommend getting this recording!"
5,The L'Engle Masterpeice - A Wrinkle in Time,"A ""Wrinkle in Time"" by Madeleine L'Engle is a great book for lovers of mystery, magic, and even some Sci-Fi. L'Engle wrote this novel powerfully about a girl [Meg Murray] and her ""special"" brother [Charles-Wallace Murray] who team up with their friend [Calvin O-Keefe]to fight an evil power. I loved this book and I think L'Engle showed her writing skills well in this book and I would recommend this book to anyone who can read english."
3,Review of audiobook,"I loved this book when I was 12 years old. I still find it mildly amusing as an adult.The audiobook is read by the author, Madeleine L'Engle. She has a squeaky and incredibly annoying voice. I found it difficult to finish the book because of this.Thus, I would recommend the print version for 11 to 13 year olds."
4,A Winkle In Time Evaluated,"I didn't like the book.I think it is too loving,like a nursery rhyme. I don't want there to be killing and death but I like action. Harry Potter is always getting in trouble and solving mysteries; Indiana Jones is too. Even Donald Duck and Looney Toons have more excitement. This book is more like Superman compared to all of the X-men. But, I still like the battle with IT and the Dark Thing."
4,A Wrinkle in Time review,"A Wrinkle in Time is about a girl named Meg Murray and her brother Charles Wallace. Their parents are both scintist. Her father is a physist and goes off to work for the government. One day while Meg and Charles Wallace were at home with their mother, they visit a haunted house and get special powers. They are visited by Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Which, and Mrs. Who who take them off to Camazotz to see there father. When they finally arrive in camazotz , Meg can see her father but he can't see her. So she loned him the glasses Mrs. Who gave her so he could see her. She talks to her father and they visit for a while. Charles Wallace got swallowed up by IT. IT controls his life. IT also had frozen Meg too. Meg came out of it and they saved Charles Wallace and they all went back home together. This is a great story for adolscents because it teaches them to care about others and it makes them realize how much they miss someone when they are gone."
2,Its alright,"This book was alright. I don't like Science Fiction as much as some people might. For people that like this kind of stuff and a story like that, this is a perfect book. I wouldn't recommend this book because it doesn't have the best plot. There could be more action on different subjects. The author just had excitement on destroying IT and the Black Thing. This book is about Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace trying to find Mr. Murry and defeat an evil thing."
5,This book is amazing.,"I read this book in about the 7th grade which was around four years ago. I loved this book when i read it. It combines fantasy and amazing writing into one book. I loved how Meg went to save her brother and father. This book is really truly amazing. When I review a book on amazon that i love, i like to look at the one star review and read why people did not like that certain book. I did the same with this book and learned that a lot of kids under the age of 13 were reading this book, and not enjoying it. They either said that they didn't understand it, and therefore it was boring, or that people can really tesser to another planet. If you do not understand a book, then you should put it down and read it a few years later. Those who stated that no one can really tesser to another planet or place are right, you can't, but this story is fiction, meaning it is not real.thank you for your timeand i sincerely hope thatyou read this book,Loran"
1,Let me start form the top why I don't like it.,"1. It is IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to travel in time or tesser as the book calles it.2. No one could survive on a different planet and or moon if a space probe couldn't even survive 20 minutes.3.This book is just a lot of blah blah blah.4. A living brain that can control every one when everyone has their own brain, give me a break.5. Even if you read this book 500 times, it has always the same plot line.A girl named Meg travels in time with her brother, Charles Wallace and the love of her life, Calvin.They travel with 3 witches, one is named Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. WHich and Mrs. WHo."
1,Did not enjoy the book one bit.,If there were 0 stars thats what i would givee it. This book is a horrible book!
1,A Wrinkle in Time,This is the wrost book I have ever read. I would really give this book a -1000!! This book SUCKS. And boy do I mean it
2,"Great book, not so great on CD","I have always loved this book. So when I saw it on the shelf of my local library as a Book on CD, I thought ""Wow, this is even read by the author, it's going to be awesome!"" Yeah, not so much. Whoever had the idea that Madeline L'Engle should read her own book should be fired. I can barely understand what she says. It's like she has some horrible lisp or some really bad speech impediment. Plus, she just isn't a good Book on CD actor. I really want to finish this because I haven't read it in over 10 years, but I may have to just check out the book and read it myself. Sorry Ms. L'Engle, but I just can't stand listening to you :-(Oh, and I'm giving this two stars for the Book on CD aspect, not the actual book contents."
2,"Disappointing, after all the praise I'd heard","Maybe the problem was that I was too old when I read this book the first time (26), but I was really disappointed. I couldn't really identify with any of the characters, and I felt the book didn't really flow, and it was very formulaic. As a real life scientist, I found the pseudo-science very annoying, even for a fantasy novel. I have re-read other fantasy fiction for children such as Lord of the Rings, the Dark is Rising Sequence, Narnia and I find I still love them as much as when I first read them. I guess this novel didn't work for me."
2,Good but dated and overrated,"My eight-year old read the book and said it's good - liked Mrs. Whatsit the most. I read the book too. Compared to the other children's books I'm reading with my children, this one is certainly a bit more on the boring side for me.What's good: the plot is still interesting, although the structure is a bit loose and there was too much repetitive tone for my taste. The lesson of love is a good one.What's not: the classic stereotype of the 60s of what the other cultures/worlds are like slightly disturbs me. To the innocent children of today's age, they may not truly appreciate what the author meant to convey. Doesn't matter, really, since I believe today's literature for children is much fuller.Overall, this is an OK book for kids to read for their imagination. However, I think it would be OK if they skip it. I'm not really sure if the book deserves the ""classic"" status it holds. Not all rejections from publishers are wrong."
3,A Wrinkle in Time is just not enough,"Unlike most people, I thought this novel was not the greatest story ever written. There were a few intriguing times and suspenseful moments, but I found it difficult to enjoy it as much as everyone else seems to. It was a hard story to understand and when I did understand it, I didn't like it. I don't like the story lines in most science-fiction stories, so I probably am not a person to look to for an opinion on any science-fiction book, but I must give you my thoughts."
3,DMC review,"This book was a pretty good. If you like fantasy books this book is for you, on the other hand if you don't like them don't read this book. I gave it 3 stars because I don't like fantasy books. This story is about a girl named Meg Murry and her brother Charles Wallace who travel through time and space to try to save their father. He has been lost while experimenting with his 5th dimension time travel. Accompanying them is Calvin who tries to help Meg and Charles Wallace in saving their father. On their way they meet up with some pretty strange people and beasts. Will Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin succeed in saving their farther in time? Read the book to find out.By, Devin M. C."
5,Nice to get back to a childhood favorite,"I don't know if this book is so great that it becomes a must-read for all children, but it definitely is imaginative and gave me good memories as a child. Going back to re-read for nostalgia was nice, and quick. If anything the author rushed the end, but it still makes for a very nice tale."
4,A Wrinkle in Time,"A Wrinkle in Time is a fantastic Sci-Fi young adults book. It is about discovery of one's self and accepting yourself as you are.The story follows Meg, her brilliant brother Charles Wallace, and her new friend Calvin as they journey through space and behind an evil cloud to find Meg's father. They are assisted by Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which, who show the children that they can do anything with the talents (and weaknesses) they have.The reason it didn't receive 5 stars is because the story fell flat in certain places and many times it seemed rushed. Also, my favorite is A Swiftly Tilting Planet, and comparing this book to that one, this book falls short, but only just a little bit."
4,fantastic,"i thought that this book was a great book for people who have a great imagination or believe that there are other life forms in the universe. Overall this book is exceptional for all people of all ages.it has a point of view from all the characters in tis book from different age groups . I gave this book 4 stars because of the great effects and emotions that are in this book, like if you lost somthing you love and had a chance to help it, you would. This is a story about their adventures."
5,It's a great book!,"This was a really great book and I thought I wasn't going to like it, huh! IT""S A REALLY GREAT BOOK! I think you should read this book. It's really good!"
4,A travel through space,"This was a great book! I could not stop reading it. I would stay up almost all night reading and I really am not a big reader. I've read some books where nothing would happen until the end ,but this book has lots of surprises and suspense throughout the whole book! Meg Murry , her brother , her crush, and three mysterous witchs go through space and other galaxies to save Megs father who disappeared years ago. I would recommend it to any kid who's into Science fiction."
4,A Wrinkle in Time,"This Newbery award-winning novel examines the power of love over evil in a battle being waged throughout the universe. A young girl, named Meg, discovers the young love between a boy and a girl, and the strong relationship and power of family love. She uses her newly found power of love to fight an evil demon that controls entire planets in far away solar systems. Although the story has a very imaginative positive message of love and commitment for young people, the writing style seems uneven and unplanned resulting in a stream of consciousness style that inhibits the flow of the story line. This science fantasy novel is appropriate for young readers between 10-12 years."
5,"Different. Interesting. Fun, but not cheezy. I like it.","I read this awhile ago, I can't be sure how long ago. I loved it, but never brought myself to read it again. I forgot the feeling about it, the way it gives you a feeling none other can, the way it isn't really like any other book. I had forgotten. So I read it again. And the feelings were revived. It's neither sci-fi or fantasy, so most, if not all, of the regular cliches are avoided easily. The characters are neat too, Charles Wallace, the charming, brainiac, sweetie-pie of a brother and Meg who thinks she can't do anything right. (her whining, i'll admit,does kind of get annoying, but its no biggie) I did especially like the humourous and kind of cute (in a strange way) three old ""ladies"" who help the kids on their quest, Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which. Read it once, and someday you too might want to rediscover it later on."
4,A Wrinkle in time was a great book.,"I liked A Wrinkle In Time because it was a book on a very strange topic, which was the tesseract (a wrinkle in time). I understand why Meg and Calvin did not understand the whole idea of Ms.Witch, Ms.Who, and Ms.Whatsit, because the whole point of what they were doing was unbelievable. I would recomend this book to all fifth graders."
5,a God loving book,its one of the best books i have read in my life. do you want to know why because it really hooks the reader.
5,A wrinkle in time,Wow. That was a very good loving book. Wow is all I can say. Meg is my hero. I loved it.
5,How I could relate to every character.,"The reason I liked this book the most was because of the realistic characters. Even though this book is a science-fiction book, I like how the characters would do reasonable things in bad situations. The only time they ever did something that might have been unreasonable, you could always argue that it seemed like the only or best thing to do at the time. Another great things is that the characters aren't too drastically pulled on one side of good or bad. No characters ever did the absolute best thing or the worst thing to do, they always did the thing that you probably would have done in that situation. 9/10 book, only thing I found wrong was that the story was a little bit to ""straight forward."" Other than that, easily 10/10."
5,Inspires Like Only the Best Literature Can Do,"I read this novel when I was 8 years old and I'm enjoying it again now at 50. Although A Wrinkle In Time is juvenile fiction, it is still great literature that can be appreciated by readers of any age. I just hope that I can pass it on to a young person who will love it as much as I do."
4,Fantastic story - wonderful language - amazing author.,"My thoughts:Fabulous story. I have always wanted to read this one and recently had the opportunity to listen to the unabridged audio (read by the author)and am in love with her style.The language is captivating and visual. I was thrilled by the characters. The human characters are interesting and well developed. The non-human characters are something more than I could have ever imagined or created. The story is entertaining and has a depth that I haven't found in ages.This story has a bit of everything; fantasy, science fiction, adventure, coming of age and even just a touch of romance (the true love of the parents and the hint of the possibility of a future romance for Meg and Calvin). The concepts are magnificent. The imagination of the author comes to life in this thrilling tale filled with the power of love, a person's ability to believe in themselves and the idea of faith.I can't wait to read the rest of the series."
5,childhood favorite,I first read this story when I was in 6th grade. That was 12 years ago and it is still one of my favorite books. I escaped into Meg's world when I read this as a kid. I found my copy I had as a kid a few years ago and once again I was back into her world. I recommend this to any little girl who feels out of place and wants to find a world to escape to. It opened my imagination and it will open yours.
5,Madeline's Masterpiece,"Main characters Meg Murry, her brother Charles Wallace Murry, and friend Calvin O'Keefe take it upon themselves to find Meg and Charles' missing father. With the help of three mysterious women, they ventour into this unkown world by means of scientific theory, a shortcut called a tesseract. Standing up against the evil IT, they are able to pursue the goal of their mission. A Wrinkle in Time was a fun and exciting book to read. My attention was never lost. Madeleine L'Engle really brought the characters to life. A Wrinkle in Time is as much an adventure as it is heart warming."
5,A Wrinkle in Time is a heart pounding story.,"A Wrinkle In Time is a heart pounding story that will capture your interest in a snap! Meg Murry takes her little brother and her friend on an unforgettable journey through time. On the way they meet aliens with tentacles, a huge brain that speaks, three very odd women called Mrs. Who, Mrs. Which, and Mrs.Whatsit, and a man with swirling red eyes.They traveled through a land of things so beautiful you couldn1t even imagine it, a planet that squishes you as flat as paper,and a planet called Camazots where everything is gray and identical - including the people! Meg and her family tesseract through evil and fight one of the strongest powers on earth! Our group would definitely all rate it either a 9 or 10 because it1s such an enjoyable book! We are all sure that you will love it too!"
4,A wrinke in time,I enjoyed reading A Wrinkle in Time. It thought it was an interesting book. I enjoyed when good triumphed over evil. (...) When I was finished reading a chapter I wanted to keep on reading to see what was going to happen next. The only part I didn't like was the ending. I would have made it more exciting and interesting. Overall I enjoyed the book.
3,A Wrinkled Brain Mind,"OK, I randomly stumbled upon and recognized this title, and am sure I read it as a young kid. Not sure when or why; but somehow, at the very least, the title sticks with me to this day. Kind of puts a little freaky feeling in the back of my mind that there is this backcatalog of literature/art/TV/music etc. that must make up some fundamental parts of my early life experience that are now just barely glimpsable memories.The mind *is* a terrible thing to taste."
1,If you like PLAGIARISM,"This book is applauded as a great kid's book, but it is a clear plagiarism of Have Spacesuit Will Travel, by Robert A. Heinlein, written ten years before Wrinkle. Some of the scenes are nearly word for word from his book. The 'theories' of space are ALL Heinlein. How this woman managed to publish this book without a lawsuit is a mystery to me. For those whom have an interest in this book, shelf it and read Heinlein. It's the better read."
1,Go Back In Time and Return This!,"Who reads this kinda stuff? Ignore and you will be happy. Diffently NOT worthy of winning any award. Meg is so depressing, not to even mention a total bore. That Charles dude is too unbelievable, and is the worst character ever portrayed. Avoid this book at all cost. It also has the uglist cover I have ever seen. I know they say not to judge a book by it's cover, but on this one you might just have to! But the cover isn't important, although it does help. But what's inside this one isn't any better than the front. Last word: AVOID!"
1,Awful - Weirded the Kids Out!,"Looking back, this was one book I could have done without. I read it to my boys. The villain of the book is an evil heart on a tray pulsing in the middle of a stadium. No joke. A heart on a plate that is evil.Supposedly this book has time travel in it. Nonsense. The sci-fi stuff was the weakest part.I think this book was some sort of religious allegory, but it had no love. No positive vibe. It had no heart. It was filled with weird characters, and it just weirded my boys out. I hated it.I don't recommend this book. It was dissapointing. Instead, try ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH"". Or, if you want Sci-Fi... ""Ender's Game."" Or, for kids, a ""step-into-classics"" version of HG Wells ""The Time Machine."""
1,don't buy it!,"This is an absolutely horrible book. Torture. We bought this as a book on tape to listen to in the car with the kids on a summer trip. All of us (40 yo, 38 yo, 14 yo, 11 yo) were miserable. We forced ourselves to listen to the whole thing because it's a ""classic"" and we kept thinking maybe we'd eventually get to some part of the story that would finally explain to us why people like it. During the story, my 14 yo observed that one of the reasons she hated the story was that the author seemed to try as hard as she could to sound intelligent to the listener (reader), but it just came across as annoying. We all ended up hoping that the characters would die in outer space."
1,"wierd, depressing and strange. hated it.","yecch! The movie was depressing, strange and just plain wierd. watched it with my 9 year old daughter. we both hated it."
3,"Midly interesting, but not as good as advertised","I found this book midly entertaining. I read it on a car trip and it was fine, but I didn't absolutely love it. I didn't care one way or the other whether I read it or not. It was not the type of book that makes you really want to read it."
2,Over-rated & Over-written...badly,"While there are some positives in that Meg is made to feel less awkward, this is a poorly written book. It is really over-rated. Allegorical, symbolic or fantastical - no matter how you read it...it is just too heavy-handed and not complete enough."
2,Needs a professional reader,"My children seems much less bothered than I about Ms. Engle's clacking dentures, smacking lips sounds, and screeching voice. It's a good story that would be much better if it were read by someone besides the author."
1,Welcome to the dark side..,"I remember reading this book when I was in the seventh grade. I loved it back then, back then it blew my mind away to a very weird place. Now that I'm 25, I decided to read it again and see why I loved it so much. All it took was one chapter to find out how dark this book is. I don't understand why they allow these type of books to be given to kids in school, at an age that we don't really know if this is the type of stuff we want to read. What are they trying to make us believe in? This book is full of pageantry, witches, and mediums. Nothing productive, nothing to learn from."
3,To complex to be a children's novel,This book seemed to be too complex and too verbose to be considered a children's novel. The idea behind it was that a scientist was kidnapped by some aliens on another planet and his family got assistance from some angels to go an rescue him from another planet and return him home to his family.
1,A Real Pain,"My teacher is making me read this book for class. I love to read, and until now I have never hated a book. The characters are confusing, the plot talks too much about other dimensions, and the story is bery boring. I don't see what is so exciting about this book that everyone loves, and I have always liked fantasy books. I can't wait until this part of the course is over and I don't understand why this is such a classic. If anyone asks me to read another book by this author I would say no way."
1,A Wrinkle In Time,This book to me wasn't very interesting to me. I didn't like the ending because it was cheap. They could of added more drama in the ending. The figurative language made no sense to me. I would reccomend this book to people who are interested in a science fiction book with stuff about the 5th dimension.
4,A Wrinkle in Time,"There is mystery, mysticism, a felling of impalpable, dark horror.It was a dark and stormy night. Meg Murry, and Charles Wallace, her little brother and their mother are in the kitchen for a midnight snack when a most disturbing visitor arrives."" Wild nights are my glory,"" the unearthly strangers tolled them. ""I just got caught in a downdraft, and got blown off course. Let me sit down for a moment and I'll be on my way. Speaking of ways, by the way, there is such a thing as a tesseract."" Meg's Father had been experimenting with this dimension of time travel when he mysteriously disappeared. Now the time has come for Meg, her friend Calvin, and Charles Wallace to rescue him. But can they outsmart the forces of evil will bump into their heart journey through space.Read this nonfiction book because it is a great book!!!!"
3,A Wrinkle in Time,"The book A Wrinkle In time, I thought was very interesting.I enjoyed the parts about time, and tessering.I thought the story line was fairly easy to follow, but tricky at some times.Overall the book was good."
4,Wonderful Fantasy,"I enjoyed this book very much. It is one of my most favorite books.I recommand this book to everyone.It makes you go into the book.But,I was surprised that Meg had saved Charles Wallace so easily.I had expected it to take much longer then that.Also I would have liked better if each thing had it's own name instead of something like ""the Black Thing"".Otherwise I think it's a wonderful book full of fantasy!!"
4,A Wrinkle in Time- Book Review,"A Wrinke in time is a great book. Madeleine L'egle did an awesome job describing the characters, events and places in this book. -Meg is a youg girl who is the ""oddball"" of her shcool. Meg's adventure began when an ""unearthly stranger"" visits her house during a thunder storm when she, her brother and her mother are down stairs having a snack. Meg has been wondering about her fathers dissapearance for years and now she has the chance to save him. But when her brother is taken by ""IT"" Megs thoughts of finding her father and everything being all better shatter. What will Meg do? Read this book to find out. -I would recommend this book to anyone who is ten to eleven and wants a book with a little action, interesting and a little bit creepy characters and a fun story. By Sarah M. age 12"
2,"Sadly, Just Okay","I'm happy that so many others liked Wrinkle, anything to get kids to read and think of others or to get adults to travel back to when they were eleven is such a beautiful thing. (Note; I am not a reviewer who gives a synopsis, you can get that anywhere, so if that's what you're looking for you'll want to go elsewhere. I'll just give my opinion, can I do that without you hating me?)Sadly, for me, I just didn't really feel the main character's longing to get her father back. It was like she was more interested in the adventure of the thing and not the purpose of the journey. I also didn't find her that interesting. I haven't dwelled on the characters at all since finishing the book (the real test of a good one, I still ponder Meggie from Inkheart, Bilbo Baggins, Harry Potter, Charlie Bucket and even old Ms. Trunchbull.) I also found myself liking the supporting characters--that clever little brother and the three aliens--more than our leading lady. All in all, still an okay work."
3,great book!,I am only about 30 pages into it and it is okay. I only payed 4 dollars for it so I don't regret the purchase but I don't feel like it is a must have. This is my first book of this sort so I don't have anything to compare it to but I would not say that I recommend it just yet.
5,Great Comedy Writing Tips,Buy it!! All Gene Perret's Books are right on. Comedy is an art that must be studiedlike all arts. Gene is very clear on this. Do it as much as possible but one very important thing HAVE FUN!
4,Muay Thai Fights Vol. 2,The fighters on this DVD showed their skills pretty well. You get to see their pictures before the fights start.
2,OK for a few simple words and phrases,So far I have tried to look up ten Irish words and have found two of them. Not a good dictionary for someone wanting to learn the language.
3,An extra piece for your collection...,"If you have a basic idea for pronouncing Irish, this is just a handy little extra for travellers to have. Not too much vocabulary, but plenty of touristy phrases about food, music, holidays, family, etc. Use as a supplement only."
2,Didn't Work for Me; But could for You.,"The first day I tested it I left it on for at least 3 hours. I did sweat a little bit; but I got nasty heat burns on my waist. I didn't sweat as much, which make me wonder: What kind of SAUNA you use dont make you sweat hard?It used properly, and after a LONG time of use might have a possibility of showing improvement on your body.But for the same time you waste with this on, you can easily invest on going to the GYM and seing improvements firsthand.*Having to plug it in the wall and restrict yourself to only being able to move on a handfull of places is a NO GO! (Unless your on a sofa watching TV and wont move for the next few hours.)"
1,Dont buy this.....,I was given this as a gift. I was not expecting results. It was just given to me so I figured I'd use it. While I was using it I noticed a burning smell. The wires were burning through and almost @ my skin. I was just in the nick of time. I would have had 3rd degree burns. Luckily I was wearing it over a shirt and not directly on my flesh.
2,All items not recieved,"iam wondering why iam not contacted to tell me where my things are and when they will arrive,iam so worried now."
4,I recommended this book,"This book explain all the steps in a procees plant and the importance of maintenance to obtain results. Safety is always higligthed, due to the strech relation with comply with the procces. The autor explain all the themes with excelente results, doing the reading very simple.It is an excelent book to introduce to maintenance and realibility."
3,not wonderful,Didn't include some of my favorites. It didn't have Crazy on it.... i wouldnt call it a best of album. But it was ok
4,DVD-R spindle,I have used this product before and it works great. Once in a while I will get a disc or two that do not work. I was disappointed when I received these in the mail because the spindle was busted in three spots and the discs were wedged in so hard that many were scratched badly. There was no cushioning in the box. So far only a few dics are bad. I am otherwise satisfied and know this was just bad shipping.
3,"Great product, poor packaging","I have used Maxell DVD-R's for quite a while now without encountering one defective disc. My only complaint is what the earlier review said. The DVD-R case was loosely wrapped in packing paper in a shallow cardboard box. When I open the case, I discovered that the black base of the spindle was badly damaged, rendering it virtually useless. Fortunately, I kept my 50-pack spindle and refilled it, keeping the other 50 on the damaged spindle in a cabinet. The product is great, the price is super, but the seller really needs to be wiser about how they pack their products. Plastic breaks very easily! Some bubble wrap would have prevented this damage."
3,Nice Songs But Sound Quality Just Fair,"I enjoy the selection of songs, however, the quality of sound is not great. You can't hear the steel drums over the annoying hissing of the maracas. In order to improve sound quality slightly I had to completely decrease both Bass and Treble. A better selection would be Island Time's Cool Caribbean Steel Drums that has been professionally recorded and digitally mastered in the USA."
3,So far so good...,"Not well written, lots of funny English in there... but is written by a Chinese so I suppose you cannot expect perfect English...Interesting book. How he describe himself and how he describe people react differently to fat and fit people! The world is so crude yet so real, isn't it?"
1,What a load of trash..,"This book is trash. Honestly, it clearly showed that the author is not pro! The book's setting is bad, structure is fragmentated and no idea what it meant to be for after reading it. And it is not about healthy living, it is about being fag!"
2,Great photography - awful hosts,"I would have to agree with a previous poster that the hosts ruin this collection for me. However, I cannot give it one star because the concept is great and seeing the book brought to life is wonderful. That being said, Melanie and her husband come across as being criminally stupid and, more often than not, my wife and I felt embarrassed that the editor allowed their inane remarks and questions to remain in the final product.I found it best to listen to the indigenous peoples when interviewed and to mute when the esteemed ""hosts"" start to speak."
4,quality,I would suggest you try to find a high definition copy. Standard definition does do the awesome views any justice.
5,Understanding Loss of Joy,I have used this book over and over again for personal study and also women's Bible studies and am now considering using it again. It has help me so much and I feel others can benefit greatly in recognizing the joy stealers. The author is one of my favorite writers and speakers.
2,Not quite what I expected,"I have the Mail Call series 1 and 2 on DVD. The book has some new material, but is a summary of the DVD series, complete with some bad video capture photos. I'm 60% way through it and have encountered several proofing errors, such as listing Carlos Hathcock as having a ""25,000 yard"" kill. That would make it a 14.2 mile shot! I'm a big fan of the Gunny, and it pains me to give the book 2 stars.I can't wait for series 3 and 4 to be released on DVD though!"
5,very happy,We received the scale in perfect shape and have been very happy with the performance. We like the display which is sort of back-lit compared with other scales. Measurement performance seems very good.
1,Big rip off,I weighed myself four times this morning and got four different weights with a range of four pounds between the lowest and highest readings! I even put electrical tape on the scale as a guide to make sure I was stepping on the scale in the same place each time. Don't waste your money.
4,"pretty good, but rate it PG?","This book answers the child's question, ""Where does kitty go when we let him out at night?"" The book is illustrated wonderfully in dark colors, and the text is appropriate to those illustrations.My only concern is that the book might be a little scary for younger readers or listeners. Taiko, the cat, goes on some rather realistic adventures, including staring down a strange dog and dodging a car on the street. You won't want a young child worrying excessively about the family pet, so be sure and read over it yourself beforehand. It's a great read for the right audience otherwise."
5,The original wall of sound,"I just picked this up again after having lost it some years ago. I'd like to second everything mentioned in the reviews below. These are very rich, dense, wonderful pieces and the performances on each of them are - at least as far as a non-classical person like me can tell - flawless.The first two tracks are, incidentally, pretty fine examples of what would come to be known as the wall of sound some two hundred years later. And they're really considerably better than most of what Phil Spector came up with."
4,Thrusters engaged as Donaldson truly starts his saga,"After the 'Real Story', the atmosphere of Forbidden Knowledge comes as a relief to readers fond of his previous works. His theme of individual victory against overwhelming odds is soon brought to the fore. There is an intriguing backstory of Angus' fate and the even more intriguing Amnion to help things along.Those sorry he didn't remain in fantasy will be relieved to discover this is space opera, not really science fiction; higher on character development, lower on technical details. Includes scenes I still clearly see months later."
4,Ggap,Ok transition book. Details are good for setting up t he rest of the story. Moving on to next book.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Alien atrocities and conspiracy.If being captured by pirates wasn't bad enough, it turns out that Morn and well as the two pirates in competition with her have an alien invasion to deal with, as they discover the rather nasty Amnion doing far worse things than violence and assault to people they have captured.She has to work out how to survive her captors, use her resources, and maybe convince others to help with the threat."
1,Died after few weeks of use :(,"It was a pretty good player to begin with. The only problems I saw at first was the inability to play/recognize DVD-R/W discs (Although it states in the product information that it does support DVD-RW)... and the inability to ""read"" subtitles on separate files for divx/avi videos. Other than that, it was working fine... until it just suddenly started turning itself off during playback. Then, it got worse... it would turn on for a while then turn itself off once you load a disc... Then, finally, it just would not stay on... it would turn on for like 1 second then turn itself off...I guess I'm kinda ""lucky"" that this happened within 30 days of my purchase. As of this writing, I am in the process of returning this back to Amazon... Hope everything goes well this time...So, buyer beware..."
1,Great Features If It Only Worked,"I bought this with my Amazon card and 30.00 off of first purchase. I don't ordinarily save all the packing but I had a gut feeling with only one review and it looked suspiciously like someone who worked for the company. Played wonderfully the first day and had features my old Philips 642 didn't have. Played it the second day and it played for awhile, then started freezing. After using every type of disc I could think of to test it, it kept getting worse and worse until it finally crapped out(on the second day!). Luckily it was within the 30 days Amazon allows for a full refund and return shipping. Still had to buy tape to box it up, plus the hassle. Better off with Norcent DP-220 divx player or Philips DVP642 divx player. Both owned by lots of family and friends with no complaints. Google both for best prices. Amazon usually has the best prices."
4,Not a bad little player,"For what it's worth, I bought this player a while ago (back when it was $36), and use it almost everyday. I love it. I actually have two DIVX decks (an LG and this Lasonic) and the Lasonic is the one I use everyday. I especially like the instant-skip feature someone else talked about (not mentioned in the manual). It's not perfect but I've never had any problems with it, and use it practically every night, mostly for DIVX/AVI watching. It's a cheap machine, but does its job well for a good price (though now at $55 it's not so much of a deal as it was back when it was $36 from Amazon) but for anyone considering this: it has its quirks but has some neat features too. If you want a top-of-the-line machine get something else, but if you want a daily workhorse that is cheap enough to replace later on if anything goes wrong (and so far mine has worked just fine) consider this. I really hate the Philips 642. I like the LG, of course that was $149 (got on sale for $129)."
1,Don't buy this unit,"I bought one and it worked so awesome the first few days, I recommended it to 2 other friends who bought them - big mistake.2 out of the 3 quit working within about 2 to 3 months. Get a jibberish display and DVD won't eject. Cost me nearly $20 just to ship it from Seattle to California - I bought them when they were about $35I was able to get the one repaired for free but the it took nearly 5 weeks from the time I sent it to get it back and like I said the shipping was $20 - so I nearly could have just bought another one. The 2nd one is out of their warranty - so I 'm just gonna toss it.This stuff is JUNK - and I'm mad eCost and it appears maybe Amazon sells it on their sites."
1,quality issues,"I bought one of these 7050's and loved it. I then encouraged 5 friends (DOH!) to buy the same model based on the excellent features and useablity. Big mistake. Most failed in 3 - 5 months. I examined the first unit to fail and found serious overheating issues in the power supply. I then replaced three leaking capacitors and moved a hot resistor off the power supply board on my unit, and it lasted about 2 yrs total, but still failed. This power supply PCB should never have made it out of the engineering lab and to the manufacturing floor with the obvious shortcomings it has. These were all manufactured in sept of 2004. Maybe Lasonic has redesigned their power supplies by now, or maybe not...I wouldn't risk it again."
1,Quality and service is poor,"I bought this dvd player in March and it stopped working after 5 months.You get the feeling when calling the company that they would not like to talk to you about the issue. When I finally get to talk to the compnay. They say that 1 year warranty only cover parts, not labor. They will not cover shipping either. So one would pay more to repair the dvd player than buy another one.Will never buy Lasonic products again."
2,Danger!! Bottom retainer can rest on electronics,"I love the upper metal bracket. However, the bottom retainer that came with it does not yield enough space to prevent it from resting on other electronic parts (little capacitors, transistors, etc.) installed on the back side of my motherboard. (I had to use my original bottom retainer plate.)"
3,Meh,"It works, but one of the screwholes wasn't threaded properly, and I had to force thread it with a larger screw. Hope you've got extra hardware around : )"
1,Go buy a pizza instead!,"After all the media hype and hallybaloo promotions for this film I finally convinced myself to buy the DVD. NEVER have I had my intelligence insulted to the extent this movie did. There was absolutely nothing to convince me that any of this story had anything to do with the fabled King Arthur as producers claimed, and it certainly lacked any redeeming social value. All it did was curdle my gizzard. Tha plot was shallow and the movie plodded on like a cheap B television production. Dont waste your money! This movie will only appeal to morons."
1,Arthur meets MTV,"Bruckheimer's provocative spin on the Arthur legend is about the best thing going for this grossly over-melodramatic disaster. This one has all the cliches firing from start to finish: grim faced actors purposefully striding into battle in slow motion accompanied by music I swear seemed lifted from Top Gun; countless overwrought misty-eyed speeches about how all men need to be free; scantily clad, great looking barbarian babes who are more than any man's equal on the battlefield; and, one of my favorites, the obligatory crowd appluase scene at the end for the hero/heroine hook-up.I have no problem with a director who reinterprets source material, provided it is done with intelligence and vision. Unfortunately, this dreck is nothing more than an extended MTV video."
1,Nothing Royal About Aurther,"This was such a disappointing movie. It could have been so much better. The fight scenes were messy, the whole movie I was asking myself ""Why??"" I know the rating King Aurther first had was ""R"" and it probably would have been better if it stayed that way. I wouldn't go see this if I were you. Hopefully the unrated version will be better."
1,The King Arthur and his hard rock band...,"I cursed myself when I rented this... this... this... I don't know how to call it... this ""historical"" insult to myths and stories about real or fairy tale king Arthur and his knights. Saxons invaded from Scotland !?! Yes, I ""agree"" and William Wallace helped them ... What about the climate? The frozen lake covered with snow not very distant from north England in summer! After that I wasn't suprised when I saw ""smart"" arrows which can find its target in vegetation. Dirctor could spare from the ""inteligent"" speeches of ""king"" ""Arthur"". But he didn't ! This DVD is presented as Director's cut... Hm, Mr. Director I think I gonna cut your ******* !Friendly advice to all costumers : AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS !!!P.S. Delete this once more if you dare!"
1,This movie is just screwed,"I saw this movie. I am sorry to say, but it was a very imbecilic and teious movie to watch. I thought I was going to...ZZZZZZZZZ...oh, wait, did i just fall asleep? Sorry. Well, as I was saying, this movie is very boring and I would not recommend it. The original Arthurian legend is much better, and did the movie producers do ANY research before this movie? Wow, and I thought I was a bad researcher! Whatever happened to Merlin's powers? What about Excalibur? Lancelot, oh my god, he sure is a total hottie. NOT!!! Oh yes, and the ending of the movie was really lame, how it ended with the wedding. I hate this movie. That's all I can say."
2,Extremely disappointing,"HOW can you mess up a movie about Arthur and the knights of the round table?!? ESPECIALLY with all the 2004 technology available to directors?!? I was looking forward to this movie for months, and was completely disappointed. The characters were badly developed, the lines badly written, the scenes badly shot. It was just awful."
3,"If only the Saxons hadn't been such ""cardboard villains""...","As nice as it looked in the theatre, and as more interesting as the director's cut may be (several scenes that I'd seen in the theatre made more sense in the DVD), there's no getting around that the Saxons in this film have no depth. Apparantly they came to Britain and trashed the island because they had nothing better to do. Of course, that wasn't the case in history, but this isn't history, it's Hollywood.One thing this version of the King Arthur story gets right, though, is that the late fifth century CE wasn't a shiny, flowery, chivalrous place and time. It was filthy, brutal, and very, very dangerous, not at all like Knights of the Round Table or Excalibur.UPDATE 2/16/05: As I write this, one hundred twenty four people are offering to sell their copies on Amazon, starting at $9.99. I saw the words ""viewed only once"" more than once, and the DVD came out less than two months ago."
3,Interesting but leaves a lot to be desired,"King Arthur displayed wonderful special effects and an overall interesting plot but ultimately fell short. Had it been labeled as fantasy and names and places changed, it would have been much better. It didn't really follow an Arthurian story. Core elements such as Guinevere's betrayal, Arthur's sister Morgan le Fay and their son Mordred and other characters are absent. If you're looking for a ""true"" Arthurian story, watch Excalibur or Mists of Avalon instead.Christians were actually a minority in the 5th century and even ""Christianized"" Britons would have held onto many pagan customs. Christians NEVER would have tortured pagans simply because they were outnumbered. Saxons didn't have a concept of racial supremacy and their intermingling with the Celtic/Roman natives is what made the ""English"" people and language. Ultimately, the Saxons DO invade Britain, otherwise we'd still be speaking Brythonic with some Roman mixed in, not an ""Anglo-Saxon"" language"
3,"Okay, but not as enjoyable as Excalibur from the 80's...","I just got back from seeing this highly anticipated summer action picture. To be quite honest, it was a huge letdown. It was still semi entertaining (hence the 3 stars), but it took itself way too seriously. Keira Knightly is as hot as ever and is the standout as the sexy yet tough Guinevere. Clive Owen was okay as King Arthur, but my biggest complaint is that annoying Lancelot and the absense of Merlin (save for a couple of short scenes). If you aren't going to have Merlin be a larger part of the film, don't have him in it at all. And please don't go in this film expecting the true history on Arthur, this film is just more theories strung together to make stupid audience members say ""I didn't know that."" Some of the action scenes were well done (Ice Battle), but I would wait to see this one on Dvd. Save your money and catch ""The Village"" and ""Alien vs. Predator"" which will both be out within the next month."
2,Watching this once was enough for me...not worth buying,It was alright but even though I like Clive Owen I found myself waiting for this movie to end. I would not own it. To me it's good enough to rent but I would not buy it because I doubt I would watch this movie again.
5,something to own,i was looking for 4 stars +..but i decided for 5 stars because it is a real amount of work to produce such a film with such results.The story and the plot is a must in his kind and the 5 stars are deserved because the picture quality is awesome mainly at a time where High definition shows up...and where some HD Dvd transfer are not realy supérior to standart enhanced definition(see my reviews)I have to admit i saw this movie in upscaling to 720P via Hdmi which is not standart definitionbuy it
4,King Arthur extended version (Director's Cut),"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I thought the cast chosen for the knights was just perfect especially how they related to one another. Also, this is a completely different take on King Arthur which I found far more believable than the legend. The director's cut is a bit more violent and graphic than the theatre version and parents should be mindful of the increased violence. However, the added violence made the movie more believable for the times.My first dvd was not in good working condition but the return process was painless and the replacement was in perfect condition."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A good cast helps elevate this mostly forgettable story of King Arthur into a story worth watching--by no means a terribly good movie, it's at least an enjoyable one."
3,King Arthur in a rehashed plot,"The plot: take elite soldiers who are ordered to rescue only a select few, but end up rescuing the whole village from an approaching army. The soldiers bicker among themselves about just sticking to the original orders, but in the end they decide to stick to their leader's wishes. The characters and the plot of King Arthur and Tears of the Sun are interchangeable. Watch one movie and you'll feel like you've watched both. The only true heroes of this movie are Clive Owen performance and the new historical twist on King Arthur and his knights. Hollywood needs new blood; new people with fresh ideas. No wonder the only successes in Hollywood are sequels."
3,Better than I had expected,"It's got action maestro Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) as a director, big budget action extrordinaire Jerry Bruckheimer as producer, and a different, but creative, take on the legendary King of Camelot. Clive Owen stars as Arthur; a Roman soldier stuck defending England against the invading horde of Saxons. Even though there are tons of historical inaccuracies, twitchy logic, and even some sloppy editing; this King Arthur still manages to be entertaining and packs in so much well choreographed action that you'll ignore most, if not all, of the bad points of the film. Owen is good as the heroic Arthur, and Keira Knightley is just plain gorgeous as warrior babe Guinevere, who loves arrows and leather straps. Ioan Gruffudd is here as well as Lancelot, along with Stellan Skarsgrd, Ray Winstone, and Ray Stevenson from HBO's Rome. All in all, King Arthur is an enjoyable, pretty much mindless, action film that delivers the goods it promises, and is better than what you may think."
3,Weak but hey,"overall I would say this was a weak film, the plot lags, the costumes are not that great and the acting tends to be not there at all.But why 3 stars? because with popcorn in one hand and a beer in the other and a lot of history jocks sitting around me we had a great time cracking jokes and having fun with this film.... it is now a party fav not quite up there with Rocky horror but gaining spped"
4,Pure Roman/Medieval Fun,If you like Roman/Medieval type movies then this one is for you. If you are a stickler for Historical Accuracy then pass on this one(hence the 4 Stars). This one is just a good feel good movie with NO METROSEXUAL Male Stars.
3,Movie,"A movie is a movie. The high deff made it a lot better compared to the first time i watched it,"
4,An interesting take on an old tale...,"This was purchased as a Christmas gift........because I knew they wanted to own a copy......and because I'd seen it myself and truly enjoyed it. The individual performances are good, the film is visually excellent, and it's an interesting, and very different, take on the legend of King Arthur."
3,for the battle scene lover,"If you love action, battle scenes, armor and chainmail, see this movie. Poor character development, simplistic, formulaic plot and cinematography that could be much more exciting hamper enjoyment of this adventure movie. However, the gorgeous guys and horses make it worthwile time spent at the cinema."
4,Entertaining but not informative,All the characters are not fully formed so if you watch it for entertainment you should be satisfied. It has a story but it is not a biography. It doesn't have to be. I did like the way the knights were from different backgrounds and places. But none are fully filled out and you have no real grasp of any of them. I little Braveheart but not as graphic. A different twist on a old theme and I felt it did not stick to a hollywood formula. This is very popular over seas and made more money there. Since it is a story of more European history that may say something for it.
1,Silly and Insulting,"I guess I should have expected as much, I mean after all one should never expect Hollywood to give historically accuracy.But this is sooo bad! I love Ray Winstone and even he gave an over-the-top hammy performance here. Ray, you and the boys were supposed to be Sarmatian warriors. Sarmatians were an Iranian people they didn't act like a bunch of slovenly Celts!And the worst of it all was this Keira Knightley. Where oh where is one supposed to suspend that much logic and belief in order to think of this stickychicky as a woman warrior?!Also the obvious anti-Christian/anti-Catholic bias was in your face from the beginning of this movie.I would never watch it again. Forget buying it."
1,See First Knight instead,"Thank god i went to a discount theater. Overacted, boring, cliche, uninspiring...you name it. Without the scenery it would have been intolerable."
1,WHAT A JOKE!!!,"I don't know where they took their information, but if that story is only about the famous warrior Arthur to protect the kingdom of Britain (like the real character did but not the legendary king) I wonder what the Round Table, Lancelot and Galahad are doing in the story as their only means when they were introduce was to lead the Holy Grail Quest.A lost of time for the team that worked on it and I am deceive to see someone like Keira Knightley accepting a role like that when Brucksomthing only wanted to use her body and to see her like that.A total waste of time for viewers and a great lack of respect for history. A movie made only to please Hollywood's pockets and taking the movie fans for stupid fool.Just too bad I cannot rate it with 0 star."
1,"Unfortunately, There Wasn't Enough Bad Press!","I got suckered into seeing this movie because I was told by the press and critic that it was an accurate rendition of life in the Late Roman Empire.WRONG!!!Perhaps I should know better than to take the word of film critics and Hollywood types. After all, they know about as much about the Roman Empire and Late Antiquity as some of the bozos on this site who rave about this piece of crap.The movie makes Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"" seem like an epic grounded in the deepest of serious research!This movie is BAAAD!!!"
1,Where the heck did this come from.,Sucks. I don't know where they get this from. The battles are some of the worst sequences I've ever scene. The only movie worse than this is Resident Evil Apocalypse.
2,2 stars for dryness and 4 for the fights,"Very dry in the begining and so on ,but the fight scenes were some of the best I seen in awhile.This movie didn't have to be as long as it was.They could have cut like 20 minutes out easily.Don't buy this movie it's a one time watcher."
4,.,if you lookin for the fairy tale version wher he pulls excaliber from the rock this is not it........ this is basically a gladiator/braveheart type of film...... kiera knightley is smokin hot and the movie is fun and enjoyable
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"I was a bit disappointed in this movie. Yes, the leader of the knights was named Arthur and there was a sort of Witchdoctor, who possessed no magic, named Merlin as well as other names that were the same as the traditional King Arthur movies preceeding this one but that is where the similarity ends. This should have been a movie about a character in the Roman army who just happened to be named Arthur. If you want to see a movie that is more what you would expect about King Arthur, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table then your best bet is the older version and in my opinion the best version ""Excalibur"". This is worth a watch but don't expect any ""magic"" in this movie"
3,King Arthur Director's Cut,"I would wait for cable. The battles are decent, the Clive Owen, as always, is excellent. The idea of Arthur as Roman soldier / captain was interesting. The other leads (Guinevere, Lancelot) were monstrously underwritten, and the villains were cartoon level laughable. In short, the film has plenty of problems.As hack and slash entertainment, it can be enjoyed, but it was shooting for something higher than that and fell well short."
5,EXCELLENT FILM!!! EXCELLENT DIRECTOR!!!!,"I absolutely LOVED this film!!!!! To me, it is the most realistic film about King Arthur EVER!! I think that the absolutely, GORGEOUS Clive Owen not only brought physical beauty to the character, but also realism. Now when I think of King Arthur, I see Clive Owen. The movie was well made. I think Anton Fuqua did a superb job. I think the reason it was not more popular is that it was not widely advertised or promoted like ""Gladiator or ""Troy"". They were superb, and King Arthur is right there with them!!!"
3,NOT MY FATHERs KING ARTHUR,"Good effort? Not really. Different, I would say and that's about it. There a lot of bloody good killing going on if that's your taste. I found no real substance to the film. The plot was very thin. It was photographed well and there was one very good and innovative scene of a confrontation which takes place on a large frozen span of ice and snow. There are some good bits strewn throughout but not enough to make this film anything more than just average."
3,"Glad I saw it, but wouldn't watch it again.",The story was good. They could've done a lot with it. but the acting was pretty lame. especially the lead character's. Owen sounded like he was just delivering lines and wasn't believable as King Arthur. The action wasn't great either.
4,Not True Blu-ray,"I read a lot of reviews and none of them really give me a straight answer on the only question that I had. ""Is this a true Blu-ray quality movie?"" The answer is NO! I love this movie and it is great, only down fall is that it is not a ""True Blu-ray quality movie."" I wish it looked like Kingdom of Heaven on Blu-ray now that movie has amazing quality."
4,Unrated??? Why??,"The biggest thing I was concerned about with this movie was letting my 13 year old son watch this with us, given the only version available at Blockbuster was the unrated version. I tried reading the reviews here, but none really mentioned why it was unrated. Bottom line - there is quite a bit of violence, no sex, and minimal cussing. I don't think in today's world it would rate an R rating, so they probably could have left it at PG 13.The movie plot provided a different twist from what I've known with others like Excalibur, and the scenery looked very nice on our 73"" Mitsubishi HD TV. In all, a pretty good movie."
2,Would be good if it weren't billed as King Arthur,"It would have been good if it hadn't been billed as the true story of King Arthur. If it had been about someone else and they had left the story of King Arthur alone, it would have been at least entertaining. As it was, I would classify this on my list of biggest wastes of time. I'm not normally a movie critic, and I'm pretty easy to please most of the time. This was just ridiculous though. I can buy Gwenivere as a warrior. I can even buy King Arthur as a Roman soldier or the Knights as Samatian warriors. What I can't buy is everything that goes on between them or the flat shallow portrayal of the his knights or the Saxons. Plus the fact that Lancelot dies before Arthur and Gwenivere even marry. Please. I typically like historical remakes of legends and fairy tales, but this was worthless as a King Arthur story."
2,History this ain't...,"The clothing, armor, etc, did not quite match up to history. The basic premise was ok and does fit some historical theories.Let's be honest, theories are all you have for some eras in history.However, I doubt any warrior, woman or otherwise, would be clad like a comic book Red Sonja or Conan. She'd be just as practical as anyone else. And while I don't think the waif actress was particularly fit, the idea behind her being a celtic warrior wasn't particularly inaccurate.The movie had its moments and some ok acting. But, history this ain't."
4,great King Arthur epic!!,"Many people didn't like this movie, but I found it to be one of the best adventure/epics of the summer. Yeah it started kind of slow but once it got started it was a Great movie! It might not have been as big as Braveheart in terms of pubcity but I still think it's one of the best!!"
3,Arthur was a different kind of Arthur,"This King Arthur movie was much different from the other King Arthur I knew from other movies. The one made it look as if Arthur and Merlin were enemies, where as in Excalibur, Merlin was Arthur's close friend and mentor. The acting was excellent and little more fighting scenes than what I expected. I would rent it rather than own it."
4,Could have been better.....but,"I still enjoyed watching this movie. King Arthur is generally considered a legend, but all legends have some basis in fact. This version has just as much legitimacy as any other. Thought it was an interesting concept. Mixing fact and fiction is always a tricky bit of business, and I thought they did well in this film. Not an Oscar candidate but still worth watching.The battle scenes were very good, the scenery of Ireland, of course, has no compare, and I didn't find many things that were not believable. All in all, I thought this was a good film, and will watch it again."
3,"King Arthur- fun, but offers nothing original","While many people are concerned if this King Arthur is the real story of King Arthur, I really dont care. I just want to see a good battle epic.Troy was a good appetizer for Braveheart fans who wanted more, but this movie may make some feel like they should have skipped dessert. King Arthur doesn't just lack emotion of past epics, but also finds itself being far too political and too cliche. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who noticed the unsubtle pokes at religon and prisoner abuse.King Arthur is worth a look. Stellan Skarsgaard does an amazing job as the evil Saxon leader, but one person can't save an entire movie. Mature movie fans might leave the theater feeling that their intelligence was just insulted. I wouldn't disagree...casting=4 starsending=2.5 starsCinematography=4 starsDirecting and Editing=4 starsplot & storyline=2 starsreplay value=2 starsoverall= 3 STARS"
3,Blu Ray Transfer Not The Best,"I really like this film and for this reason ""upgraded"" this one to blu ray. I won't rate the sound because I only have my front speakers and sub hooked up. But PQ, not the best because it has a tendency to be too dark in places unlike my standard edition.Overall rating is 3 stars simply because the transfer is'nt up to par."
1,Stinks Worse Than A Saxon Raider...,"...and I heard they really stunk.Historically based? Based on what? Crank, neo-pagan Celtic nationalism? Of the kind you find in books which have little fairies on their covers and sold alongside incense and candles, tarot cards and claddagh rings in those new-agey shops run by chubby, middle-aged, goddess-worshipping women? This movie is one of the most UNhistorical, chronologically-challenged, Anti-Catholic, over-the-top flicks I've seen in a long while.Not to mention, the acting is so hammy you can make sandwiches out of the DVDs.A waste of my time and interest. I turned it off after suffering through some twenty minutes of what I consider one of the worst movies ever made."
3,A must see,"King Arthur really falls in the category of Gladiator, Troy, Kingdom of Heaven and Alexander. I have rated all these movies with a 5 Stars each.Regarding the filming of King Arthur; it is simply superb; The actors did a pefect job as well; music even better. The only reason for the 3 Stars ONLY is for the dialogue which is weak and slow. However, If you watched and enjoyed either Troy, Alexander, gladiator or Kingdom of Heaven, King Arthur is a must see. Enjoy"
2,I'd be less disappointed if not for the hype.,"Much of the hype surrounding King Arthur was regarding the historical accuracy of this movie. Sadly, setting aside, this movie is on par with ""First Knight"" on terms of historical accuracy. Further, the movie was not all that great on its own merits. With a weak plot that often barely strings itself along, the action scenes are often the only redeeming element.In regards to accuracy, please don't confuse the lack of fantastic spells and a magic sword with historical accuracy. The movie is decent in the drama department, strong in the action department. Taken for what it is, it's an okay rental movie, but little more. I've been reading historical facts and theories of Arthur since elementary school, however, and the movie is far off base (Even though it professes ""new information,"" which is movie shorthand for ""we're making stuff up."")."
2,A watered down Fairy Tale!,"King Arthur is a watered down fairy tale that dissapoints greatly, because of what it could have been. This non-myth take on the character has Arthur as a Roman Soldier played dully by Clive Owen, who usually seems more alive, who leads a group of men enslaved to Rome until after thir final mission. It is a waste to talk about the characters, as they are not developed and serve no purpose other than to fight. Keira Knightley does well in her small role, but not enough to save this film. The action scenes, outside of a great fight scene on ice that is about to break, is watered down and boring. The characters are boring and it is obvious by the tacked on ending and flow of the film, that they cut out the gritty scenes in favor of a PG-13 action epic- which onlyn Lord Of The Rings can accomplish. The director's cut won't be perfect, but it may make this film pass for good or at least almost good, instead of entertaining crap."
2,"Good, but...","When I saw trailers I thought this movie looked pretty good, and I saw it yesterday. It was entertaining at parts, but it didnt leave a lasting impression.The action scenes weren't too great, and apart from the scene on the frozen lake I didn't enjoy them too much. I thought the movie would tell the true tale of King Arthur, but it didn't. Lancelot and Guinevere weren't lovers, Arthur and Guinevere got married(what?! aren't they supposed to be siblings?). Merlin didn't play a very big part in the movie either.There was one thing I thought was weird...if the Romans left the wall, how could the gate/doors open without anyone to operate them, since they seemed pretty big and heavy."
3,What the heck?,Like all of the king arthur movies Lancelot dies and this makes no sense they make you think that Lancelot will meet up with his family again! Well you could rent it if you have a strange desire to see it but it was overall just okay...
1,The best spoof of Braveheart I have ever seen.,"For one thing, I am not very fascinated by the Arthur legend. I am more capativated by Beowulf or The Odyssey, tales with epic scale and human cores. But with Arthur, I don't feel it as much, and to get a movie about it done so poorly lowers all hopes for it. As if to insult the intelligence of the audience, Keira Knightley's Guinevere is put on the cover of the posters and DVD, as if the audience could not see the fact that she has about 30 minutes of screen time, thereby making her not a major character. Using someone as gorgeous as her to make money as part of advertisment is insulting; there's no getting around this one. I thought Clive Owen made a good Arthur, but he could not save this atrocity. The battle sequences were a great example of LOTR battle envy and style over substance, something an epic movie should avoid. Watch Braveheart and skip this lame, boring so-called epic."
1,Watch Excalibur instead!,"If this is the ""true"" story, I'll take fantasy anyday.For instance, would you rather see Lancelot as a great swordsman & knight or skinny little guy that complains alot? Merlin as a great mage or old dude that runs around in the forest? Etc etc."
2,"Cool battles, not so cool film","This film is interesting for the first 30 minutes or so; then it falters. I am a King Arthur lover-books, films, myth, Malory-yet this was disappointing. I did, however, think that the actor playing Arthur is the most handsome one to ever have played the role. So if that helps the film for you, as it did me, then watch the first hour or so. If not, just see Excalibur, The Mists of Avalon, or read Malory's version of the Arthur story."
1,Not for the Romantic Disposition,"I love the romance of the old Arthurian legends. (Heck I even love Monty Python's The Holy Grail.)But this revisionist history gore-fest was not for me. Bloody battle scene after bloody battle scene, this movie was obviously competing for the kind of audience garnered by the Lord of the Rings movies. I know life was cheap and bloody in the olden days, but this is not what I associate with King Arthur and Guinevere. If you like big, bloody battles, then you will probably love this movie and be able to overlook the plot holes, inconsistencies and absurdities."
1,King Of Pain,"This travesty is an insult to any movie lover particularly those with any inkling of the 'true' Arthur story or even basic reality such as the difficulty that Guinevere would have to go through in order to have eye shadow and makeup in the dungeon where they found her. Even her supposedly messed up hair had all the makings of a day at the spa with Fritz when she tells him ""Make me look messy yet fabulous.""Fuqua has added yet another diappointment to his repetoire after the sizzling Training Day (in retrospect looking more and more like it was Denzel fueled rather than the director's own talent) with this mess. There is no real exceitement here. Arthur has all the emoting abilties of a piece of driftwood and the knights are all your average bawdy badasses who you could care less whether they live or die. Nice to see Guinever's character continuing the annoying trend of period pieces that feel that they need warrior queen sterotypes to portray a strong woman. STAY AWAY."
1,Disconnected and boring,"Movies, like books, trigger your emotions through the viewers or readers relating to the story and becoming submerged in the plot; ""King Arthur"" does absolutely none of this.Through the entire movie, I found that the characters not only didn't have depth but were completely emotionless. It was like watching robots doing day to day activities. With that in mind, It was difficult to care whether or not the characters lived or died.Overall, If you enjoy movies where are completetly detached from the story and want to blow five dollars, this is the movie for you."
2,Totally different from and worse than what I expected.,"If I had not watched the DVD and found that the Authur, Lancelot and Merlin in the movie were completely different from what I had known for years, I would not have checked the reviews here and read the message by the screenwriter that I might have rated the movie one star less.Despite the very contemporary theme about ""freedom"" (and made the story not that believable), and the very weak storyline of the friendship and love between Arthur and Lancelot, Arthur and Guinevere (Keira Knightley), Lancelot and Guinevere, the directorship and cinematography are substandard. I made no attempt to compare it with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. However, I must say that Gladiator and Braveheart are much better. Few fans of ancient war stories would be satisfied, I bet.Anyway, marginally acceptable for rental only. Dont buy it. In fct, if it were not for Owen and Knightley, I might not have been able to finish watching it at all."
3,Channeling Brando,"I was falling off the chair with laughter in Stellan Skarsgards' first appearance, speaking to his son...Check the accent...What a tribute!, to Brando, that is...Watch this scene again thinking of Brando and James Caan in the first Godfather...Hilarious!!!...Not sure if it was intentional, although it could've been filmed around Brandos' death...Typical Bruckheimer outing, some good scenes, and overall worth a look...Clive Owen doesn't quite have it, he's far better in Gosford Park...I thought Tolkein had already rewritten British mythology...And Boormans' ""Excalibur"" is FAR superior..."
1,This movie is BAD.,"Well if your a fan of Excalibur then this movie really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Give me a break with the modern day politically correct garbage. Keira Knightley seems to have left the set of Pirates of the Caribbean and on to this one. She reminds me of Orlando Bloom where she over acts her role.This is an MTV world movie made for an MTV world. Why not just have Guinevere possess excalibur and be done with it? Don't even bother with it. Stupid, stupid, stupid.If you want a King Arthur movie, watch Excalibur. That's how it should be done."
4,Worth Seeing,"King Authur was worth seeing. The real King Authur was not the romantic, chivarlous knight protrayaed in ""Le Morte de Authur,"" but a Briton king during the time this movie is set. This movie gives a probable alternative to the myth that has become popular. The movie was action packed and multi-layered. I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Just saw this movie,"If you are a fan of the Bernard Cornwell Series, ""Enemy of God"" you will enjoy this movie. It is not the mythical/legendary version of his tale but the historical possibility of how his legend may have come about. It depicts a very small time frame when the Romans were abandoning Briton and the Saxons were taking advantage of that fact and engaging the Britons/Celts that were left behind and Arthur's deeds in becoming their king.-Excellent battle scenes that are not too graphic for younger folks.-Kiesha Knight is darn sexy as Guinevere-Battle and key scenes are dramatized ala Armageddon which corny as it may be, I liked very much-Clive Owen, is well cast as Arthur.-Cinematography is well done."
5,You must all be on crack.....This movie is wonderful,"First off people, this is a hollywood film. If you want to watch a movie that is based solely on historic events then tune into the history or discovery channel on cable... Look at First Knight with Sean Connery and Richard Gere.. you think that is accurate? I think not.. Same goes for Braveheart, 13th Warrior, 1492 which was about the voyage of Columbus.This movie is by far one of the best action movies I have seen in a long time. If you have surround sound especially.. with all the battle scenes and horses galloping just engulfs you more in the movie..For all the other reviewers here that decided to let everyone know about the true ""history"" of King Arthur, you should go sit down in your chair and watch the history channel.This version is a much more realistic version of how the legend of King Arthur grew.5 stars all the way..."
4,A Better Guenivere,"What I liked best about this film is that is managed not to rehash a lot of tired Christian-ethic inspired morality about Guenivere. The traditional version is so appallingly anti-female, the whole story a chastisement about the weak, inconstant Woman whose lust and lack of discipline brings down the Noble Christian King and all his Good Works. What rot. This film at the very least shows Guenivere as a strong person, a warrior and defnitely a Player in the whole story, chosing which man she wants and not waiting on the battlements waving her kerchief waiting to be rescued."
3,King Arthur,Nice movie. Not one of the best out there but I definitely did enjoy this. A somewhat more realistic view to the tale of King Arthur and his legend. It's predictable but the actor / actress were entertaining. Nice picture and sound on a plasma TV.
5,Good Story and Great Action,"I couldn't believe the reviews that the critics said when they saw this movie. This movie was Awesome. Believe me don't listen them. Its got great fight scenes, good story and great acting. I think people were expecting some fantasy and love triangle, like we see in other Arthur movies. But this was different Im happy it didn't have any of that stuff in it. Something new the real story of King Arthur. I can't wait to see the Unrated Version. In my opinion I liked it better than Troy"
5,Arthur,"If you are any kind of Arthur or Excalibur buff, or even if you are not, this movie is excellent! It is beautifully shot and the story line is fantastic. While Excalibur deals more with the fantasy legend of King Arthur and Merlin, this movie is based on the more actual facts behind the myth and who these knights were. It makes the movie very real and moving. Clive Owen is a wonderful, humble Arthur. This is one of my all time favorite movies!"
4,King Arthur Revised and Revisited!,"Excellent production, with a different point of view. If you are not a hard-core, die-hard, King Arthur fan, you will probably enjoy the movie. Notwithstanding the slightly skewed point of view, it is well-played. Where's my popcorn!"
5,not your father's Arthur,"Forget about Camelot, this Arthur is Roman, the Saxons are the bad guys, and the knights of the round table are Sarmations from the Steppes. Merlin is a Woad and Guenivere is his daughter. I have no idea if this could have happened, but 1000 years ago, who knows.The movie is not the theatrical version I saw, Arthur's young life where he learned about free men and free ideas from his teacher is missing, but the story line of the movie is straight forward and narrated by Lancelot."
4,King Arthur,"This was another slant on an old tale, probably more true than the original one's we grew up on. I really enjoyed it, as did the entire family. A great film, if you don't mind a bit of gore. Mostly it is about winning the right way."
2,"Great cast, horrible script and movie.","I rented this film just because my fave Clive Owen was in it. But man, this movie was so horrible. Very boring, no real storyline and no depth to it. The acting was ok. Ioan Gruffudd (starred in Fantastic four as Jessica's love in the movie) did an amazing job though in his part. I wish he wasent killed at the end.I didnt recognize him in this movie. I didnt like how there was no build up of Clive and Keira's love. They make out once and then at the end of the film they get married? At least show some love developing.Nicole M*"
2,Huh?,"A mishmash of genres, bad history, poor writing and a boring story are among the reasons to pass this by. (An aside,when will a single small woman in hand to hand primative combat be realistically shown- she dies.)"
1,15+ minutes of uninterruptible commercials,"I bought the blue-ray edition to enjoy this otherwise very good movie in the highest resolution... Unfortunately, the people responsible for mixing this disk have decided that it is OK to inflict on paying customers more that 15 minutes of commercial and other wasteful disclaimers without the possibility of invoking the main menu. That is more that I can bear, I returned the infomercial.These people makes it very hard to be supportive.. the torrent version, at least, is commercial free."
1,King Arthur,"Pure rubbish, bad acting, bad directing, bad all around. I can accept a film that is not historicially accurate, that it not the issue. This film simply has no redeeming qualities. The battle scenes are very poorly done and are not believable. The story line is weak and the actors do a miserable job. Strongly suggest you rent before you buy."
2,Mythology without the Magick.,"This was a good attempt. It was probably more historically accurate than any of the plethora of other Arthurian works on film. I have no complaint concerning the quality thespianism demonstrated here. The direction was excellent, the photography was wonderful, and I even managed to appreciate the camera angles, CGI used in fog creation, etc.I don't know about anyone else, but I -like- Magick in my mythology. Magick is in all mythology; even christian. It's called something else, of course, but it's all Magick, just the same.While I enjoyed this attempt, it just was not the Legend of King Arthur I embrace. The Magick and mysticism are gone from it, and it lost all attraction for me. It felt like watching Spiderman with no powers, or Superman when he couldn't fly. It completely failed to capture imagination due to its having none of its own.If you felt like I did, I highly recommend John Boorman's ""Excalibur."" That was a magickal endeavor in the name of King Arthur."
1,1 star is too many,"Let's take a few moments to talk about one of the worse movies in history. This is it. There is a reason you can buy it used for 6 bucks. I am not sure what was worse the plot, or the lack of any direction for the charatures. It was very confusing and long, it never seemed to go anywhere and by the end of the movie I was just hoping that they would all be killed so that it would end. I am a huge fan of historic dramas, and romantic anything. BUT THIS was just plain stupid. I just wonder how you talk a studio into spending this kind of money to create something so horrible??"
3,historically inaccurate,"Even had King Arthur turned out to be a decent film, there would still have been the obvious mistake of making the movie set as Roman England. One must presume that the legend of King Arthur takes place in medieval england, and if my history lessons are correct, the reason the Dark Ages even occured was because Rome fell. So how can Arthur, the medieval King of England, be a roman commander?"
1,HOW SAD,"At the begining it was misleading, cause i thought there was going to be Roman legions fighting against the English and he would change sides, but no, ROme does nothing at all in this pieck of crap.Basicly, its a crapy movie with a low budget, ugly girl(really, if you wanted a tom girl get someone who can act at least), cheep actors, bad story, and puthetic special effects. The only thing it did have was that a lot of people came in HOPING it would be different. To be fair though, Arthur was not too bad an actor, and with real special effects, he could really play a knight or something."
1,THIS MOVIE IS STUPID!,"I won't go into the many many stupid things about this movie, just the most obvious:Why is it called ""King"" Arthur?In this version Arthur isn't even a KING!! Even the TITLE reveals that the filmmakers are absolutely CLUELESS!!Beyond that the script stinks, the camera never stops shaking or tilting to one side and for some reason Gwenivere is now a Knight of the Round Table...or something."
4,One of best Arthurian movies yet!,"This is a cracking movie! Yes, it's rather smaller in scale than some of the bloated epics of late, but it has good production values, terrific action scenes, manages a unique spin on the legend (one that's supported by the current train of Arthurian scholarship), and affords Stellen Skarsgaard his best opportunity yet to give us his much-admired Marlon Brando impression as the hairy villain. As it happens, shortly before the film came out I was involved in a similarly revisionist Arthurian performance project using material from early sources, and out of all the stories the Romano-Celtic interpretations proved the most popular. So thank you Messrs Franzoni and Fuqua for serving us something refreshingly different, intelligent and exciting. I look forward eagerly to the Director's Cut."
3,"I liked it, but...","I saw this movie in theatres and liked it very much. However, when I brought the unrated and so-called 'extended' version of the film home, I was rather disappointed. Oh, sure, they added a whole bunch of new battle scenes, but they also cut out some of the amusing parts that I enjoyed in the theatre. I don't think it's true, when they say it's extended. They could say it's 'different', but not 'extended'. I suppose there must have been an issue about continuity within the film to make them do it, but it is disappointing. When I see the word 'extended' on a DVD's cover, I expect them to have added more, not taken away bits and pieces and then added slivers of battle scenes."
4,Long Live The King,this movie is pretty good. it has some very good battle scenes in it. this movie is about the story of the untold story of king Arturs life. if you watch the movie you'll understand on what i'm talking about. it's a very good movie.
4,I appreciate the story based on the latest research,The story is based on the latest research about the origins of Arthur. I enjoyed the movie and the characters. The characterizations feel more real to me than the usual fare. The girl was great to look at but didn't add much to the story. I bought the Director's cut not for the violence which is not necessary but to get more information about the basis for the screenplay.I recommend that you use this movie as a jumping point for additional research into the origin of the Arthur mythology
4,A United Kingdom,"I won't dwell on a synopsis of the film, as you can read that in many of the 400 reviews here.It's an very good film, especially rousing to a brit, like me. However, no-one knows whether Arthur was a Briton or not, indeed this film suggests that his mother was and his father of Roman descent. This does not matter, nor any of the historical inaccuracies - for they should not mire your enjoyment of this bloody tale.Enjoy."
4,History Lessons should be read,"Unfortunatly, if you read the Amazon review written, you will be sadly misled. Had the writer actually researched the actual legend of King Arthur and his knights, he may know that this production is much more accurate than the hollywood glitzy movies that have been put out in the past. This movie is an excellent portrayal of the spoken tales of King Arthur. No one knows if he truly existed(but if he did, one can only hope he looked like Clive Owen does).It was called the Dark Ages for a reason, and this movie depicts how dark and desparate the time was. Guinevere is portrayed as a more modern character - a metaphor of the earth.This story is not the light and lively one that most of us have come to recognize, but a more accurate showing of the era. Well done."
5,The moat accurate story of King Arthur!,"I've always been interested in history and read a lot of stories on the mysterious ""King Arthur"" and I do believe this story is the most fitting and accurate. I've seen this movie many times and do not find it any less interesting. A story befitting a true king...."
4,"Good Film, Nice Extras","I really love this movie, so it was good to view it again to use in my Senior English class as a more historical view of Arthur that Malory's Morte d'Arthur. I also like the behind the scenes extras and interviews. Very enlightening."
4,New take on Arthurian Legend,"How refreshing for Hollywood to approach the King Arthur story from a different perspective. I personally just viewed this today and was quite entertained. Could this be how the Arthurian Legend started, one never knows. Don't listen to all the critics about how bad this is. Just view it for what it is - entertainment,does anyone really care if the type of weapons or armor is correct. In the Adv. of Robin Hood w/Errol Flynn does anyone really believe they ran around in the forest and castles w/all the colorful costumes - not - but it still is my all time favorite movie.Clive Owen does a outstanding job as Arthur and I'm glad they didn't have the famous love triangle going on w/Lancelot.On to the dvd - picture quality outstanding - sound leaves a lot to be desired. Should have had DTS available. Most of the sound is from the front and what I would call thin. Someone did not pay enough attention to the sound qualtiy on this one."
2,Now let me see...,"...Braveheart 5? Sorry, but this was the last epic about Knights for me - I loved Braveheart, but King Arthur in my opinion is a movie so slow, ungripping, and there are no surprises here - it's a miracle they didn't fall asleep making it. The acting was okay, but the camera-work and the filming of the story, well, this has been done too many times before now - it's all been seen before - and frankly after Braveheart I don't think King Arthur was worth making another movie for, sorry..."
4,A fantastic movie!,"I will admit that this wasn't what I expected. King Arthur has always been one of my favorite collection of stories. So, when it came out it was all I could talk about for a few days. You know there is some movie scores that annoy me or depress me, but this one made me want to fall on my knees and cry. Beautifully done! It's the reason I loved Gladiator so much. All the characters did a great job at bringing the story to life. However, Lancelot's character disappointed me very much. That was Arthur's right hand man. He was not supposed to oppose Arthur's decision nor criticize his religion. And then he died. But, other than that, it was a wonderful show. Great music, great characters, great story, who could ask for more! If you haven't seen this one I strongly recommend it! It is worth the money!"
5,Great underrated movie,"If you are a historical purist I suggest you go back to watching documentaries and amateur produced historical fiction with awful acting but if you are looking for some entertaining pseudo historical take on King Arthur's legend this movie is great. Well choreographed battle scenes, interesting story line, unusual depiction of ""knights"" of the round table. Are all the little details historically accurate? Probably not but how else would they tie it up with the medieval fantasy story. Is the plot plausible? Absolutely! The bottom line is: this movie is fun and entertaining. Definitely worth buying and watching."
4,Give it a chance you just might like it,"If you like movies produced by Jerry Bruckhiemer you should enjoy this movie. I found it a very entertaining telling of King Arthur and his knights. There are no shockers just a good blockbuster. Clive Owen does a good job as do the other Knights in the movie. In fact the other knights make the movie more enjoyable and don't forget about Keira Knightley in 1080p!The movie looks great on blu-ray some scenes are a little soft but if you watch the sd-dvd you will see the same thing. The sound was good, though I can only comment on the DD 5.1. I am sure the uncompressed track is even better.Don't go nuts picking it apart just pop some popcorn and enjoy, thats the point of movies after all."
3,Could have been better,"This movie really wasn't that bad. Some of the parts were weak but it was a descent movie overall. Hot guys riding on horses, need I say more? (Especially Lancelot!) It's worth the price of admission."
2,Historically innacurate,"I hate the fact that this movie tries to come off as historical.There are historical inaccuracies.1. Portraying the Roman occupation as lasting into late into the 5th century(historically they withdrew in 410AD).2.The Saxon Genocide. Modern research seems to indicate that rather than destroying the natives, the invading Angles and Saxons settled amongst and intermarried with the native Britons.Also,the first Anglo-Saxons were invited to Britain as mercanaries by the Britons. The 'Anglo-Saxons' of later centuries were the decendants of both culturally Anglo-Saxonized Britons and the invading Anglo-Saxons.3.The battle of Badon Hill takes place in southern England not in the north.4.The Picts were the enemies, not the allies of the Britons and part of the reason why the Britons hired Angle and Saxon mercanaries."
3,"Not what I was Expecting, But i got what i needed...","This movie was ok, not the greatest King Arthur movie out there but it had its good points and bad points,I would agree with the rest of the reviewers and stick to other King Arthur movies like ""Excaliber"". Me, Im going back to Monty Python and The Holy Grail..."
1,King Arthur for Pagans!,"King Arthur is now a pagan knight who battles the evil Saxons and Christian church.Arthur is a cavalry auxiliary for the Romans as they abandon Britain. He turns against the wicked Roman church and joins the pagan Woads in an alliance against the savage Saxons. Later, Arthur participates in a Druid pagan ceremony.If you are a wiccan or just don't like Christians, this is a great King Arthur for you!Keira Knightley as Guinevere just doesn't work for me. She is built like a 12 year old boy. That just doesn't cut it as a warrior-princess.Good battle scenes, but I prefer the medieval armor of traditional interpretations."
3,Almost Made It,"An interesting spin on an old tale. Arthur is fabulous, Lancelot sufficiently dashing, but Genevieve! Keira Knightley ruins the role. Those funny movements she does with her mouth! Shortly after Arthur rescues her half-dead she's flirting with him sassily. And to top all that off, she's a warrior (!) in an absurd costume designed to let us all know she's female. Arthur should have left her in the prison. What an example of how a good movie can be rendered mediocre by a single ill-cast part."
2,D'oh-eth!,"Interesting concept but the execution was lacking. The battle scenes were staged to mimic those in LOTR but with Saxons instead of Orcs only with the Orcs being FAR more interesting foes than the Saxons were. The actor playing Arthur delivered his lines as if he were a wooden statue instead of a live person and his merry band of knights appeared to be rejects from every lame TV docu-drama or western ever filmed. When they were sitting at the round table near the beginning of the film, I kept expecting them to break into the Knights of the Round Table song and dance scene from the Monty Python movie.Really, not a very good movie, I'm afraid. However, I did watch the whole thing so, on the basis of that, I give it two stars instead of the one it deserves."
1,Don't buy if you have a choice,"This book was a required text for my java class. In conversing with my classmates, we all agree that this book wasn't of any help. I would recommend any other book, this one is just too abstract for a beginner. It's difficult to apply the concepts, and the flow is jagged. With the addition of a teacher, and reading this book from front to back, my java class sucked hard because i didn't have that solid foundation I needed."
3,This is not as BlueJ as it should be...,"Let me say first: I love the BlueJ environment. It is by far and away the best environment I have ever seen for learning or teaching Java. I was facinated after reading the tutorial that comes with it (from www.bluej.org), and I got this book.This book is okay, and has some good points to it, but the 'BlueJ' tag on the front cover is a bit misleading. I got the impression that it was added as an afterthought, and does not make really good use of the BlueJ environment.BlueJ opens many fascinating possibilities (calling methods directly on an object!) and not much of this is used in the book. A bit disappointing. Otherwise the book is okay."
5,Taste the vintage,"For the average person who has visited the Napa Valley, this book takes you behind closed gates and opens eyes with garden splendor."
5,Brilliant,"This is meant for tripping.. I don't necessarily mean drugs but I have found that road trips with this cd are quite moving. A kaleidescope of emotions oozes from the speakers as one traverses the countryside. The man is in tune with the human psyche unlike many others. Join him and experience the thrill that is ""the man like....."" Unbelievable!"
5,"Perfection, and nothing less","When I first heard of Sasha, it was I believe his tune ""Wavy Gravy"" that had raised my awareness of him in the year 2003. I was only getting into progressive house music at the time. Later that year, a friend of mine was playing Involver in the car and I asked him to give me a copy.He gave me a copy, and for that whole SUMMER of '04, that CD, has not ONCE left my cd player. Where ever I would drive, Involver was playing. I fell in love with the music so much, that whenever I was going somewhere the best part about it was the cruise from point A to point B listening to the music. The mixing is flawless, and the choice of tracks is so lush and beautiful. When you ask yourself what is progressive - progressive is Involver."
4,Putting the World of Progressive Trance On Hold,"I must agree with the majority of reviewers in regards to this album...it is difficult to deny the quality and skill of this remix. For this fact alone, I truely can appreciate Sasha's Involver.However, I wasn't overly thrilled with the track selection. For the most part, Sasha's talent for intricate and complex multilayering of sound shines through. This significantly improves on the original releases of many of the tracks featured on Involver. The difference for me in reviewing this album? Despite Sasha's (improved) remixed versions, the original tracks transform from average to very good...just not spectacular.Overall I give this album 4/5 stars."
4,Sasha couldn't go wrong with this one,"I've never been particularly fond of Sasha's productions in either Xpander or Airdrawndagger. Nor am I particularly entranced by his work with co-hort John Digweed. However, his skills in revamping classic tracks into hip re-mixes has never been called into question in my mind. Add to that his knack for mixing progressive music as demonstrated in GU013 and you have a great cd that retains Sasha's original talent.This is by no means is on par with Sasha's uber-album Global Underground: Ibiza or some of the better Northern Exposure sets, but it certainly has some catchy tunes that definitely merit several run-throughs on your way to work or the club."
2,all mashed up,"I love sasha and all he has done for the scene but jesus, he kills all of these perfectly good songs with his new realtime remix tech. If you love the sasha that has awesome song selection and mixing skills on his mix cd's and live performance , and not as much of a fan of his production work you are going to hate this cd."
2,"A disappointing, dated effort","I wish I could agree with the Amazon reviewer; this one is not ""pure, weightless elegance"" unless you like being caught in a disco in the Castro, circa 1989. I'm actually a big fan of Sasha but find some of his stuff embarrassing to listen to. A lot of his drum and keyboard patches are very stale and he deploys a lot of them in the second half of this disc, along with some Amyl-snorting vocal parts that went out with Soft Cell.Involver starts out very promisingly, with the pleasing guitar parts (a new thing for Sasha) in ""Dorset Perception"" and the jagged synth rhythms in ""These Days"" and ""What Are You to Me"" but wraps up in kiddie-clubland. This disc is nothing like Airdrawndagger (which I loved) and is much closer to the Northern Exposure discs, most of which I also can't stand. For many listeners, this will tickle their nuts."
3,Airdrawndagger is better,"My decision to buy Involver was based purely on my past experience with Airdrawndagger and Sasha's essential mixes. I am a bit dissapointed. I just don't see the same quality, and emotion in Involver that I've seen in Sasha's past works. Hopefully the next album will be better."
1,Hand me an airsick bag,"It was stupid to expect another ""Air Drawn Dagger"", but I was apalled to hear how poor this CD was. A friend had dissed the stupid packaging, but I didn't pay much attention-then I bought this CD. Well. Is this perhaps old, experimental trash recordings that someone threw together to satisfy a contractual agreement? This is NOT the Sasha who made ADD-nonono!And that crapola packaging? Call me a b*st*rd, but I was so aggravated with the ""case"" and the moronic, pointed, ""photos"" that I pitched the whole freaking thing while I was on the bridge. Yes, I littered and no, I am not repentant. Too bad I didn't toss the lousy disc, too."
1,boring like airdrawndagger,continues where the last cd took off...BORING. he seems to have abandoned the genre he help build and embraced. the last two cds were a big disappointment. he needs to go back at what he does best...
5,Involver is Born,"If you can see him LIVE, my suggestion is DO IT! I danced for hours @ Seven. The Involver tour is just as amazing as the CD itself. Sasha has taken each track, stripped it to it's bare elements, and remixed them to perfection. When you pop in the cd and here the bass kick in on Grand National ""Talk amongest themselves"", you know right then and there it is going to be good. The transistion from Petter ""These Days"" to Unkle ""What are you to me?"" is incredible. The acappella falls right into ""These Days"" and carries thru the record. Airdrawendagger is good but Sasha takes this to a new level. Beyond house and trance. But what do you expect when he has an amazing production team to work with, Charlie May and Barry Jamieson. If you want something beyond your regular progressive, house, and trance, then buy it."
3,True artistry!,"This CD wasn't quite what I expected. I was hoping for something more along the lines of what Sasha did with Airdrawndagger. As this album turned out, I feel that it is somewhat akin to some varieties of classical music: You realize it that you are hearing some of the greatest artistry the world can put out, but then you realize you would rather toss in your good ol' ""rock out"" CD and go to town with that instead.So, I'm not disappointed with the album, in-fact, Sasha himself kind of says it himself in the liner notes several times. Many of these songs wanted to be remixed into great dance-floor anthems. Instead, Sasha found himself taking many of the remixes in a different direction. I just don't really appreciate that direction. Airdrawndagger IMO is one of the best albums EVER, and if you want more of that, don't look in Involver's direction."
4,Grows on you,"When I got this cd I just felt it's a bit mellow because it really is mellow. Sasha's life performances are amazing. I was in NYC at avalon on new year 2004 and he was awesome. This cd is not his live music, but its an amazing compilation of great electronic work that Sasha put extremely well together. As R. Ocampo ""leonpro"" mentioned in his review, the packaging for limited edition is tough to handle, weird messy pics in a plastic bubbly cover that ends up all over the place. All that stuff aside, after listening to this cd for at least 4 weeks, I grew to love it. It is very well done and doesn't disappoint. A true electronic music fan will absolutely appreciate it. However, I am more into fast paced real live Sasha work and this is not it, so I can't give it 5 stars. Although if you are into electronic music, you should do yourself a favor and get this mix."
4,Heavenly,"This guy Sasha is definitely evolved--to an artistic levelhigher than most human beings.How I would've love love loved this heavenly CD...IF it hadbeen vocal-free...but that's my bias. If you don't mindvocals in your electronica, this CD is really reallyoutstanding & serene & ecstatic...ahead of its time.I wish they'd release a vocal-free verison of Involver.Also, I must agree with other reviews that trash the""special packaging"" edition. (...) Avoid that mess and get this CD in the regularcase...I wish I had."
4,the man is back!!!!!,Sasha's latest release is just very cool and downbeat. i have followed sasha's career since renaissance mix one (before they re-released it). Sasha is an absolute great mixer and his track selections are head on. Sasha is at his finest and i would recommend this to any of my friends. peace
2,Sistine Chapel ??,"You would anticipate your descent into hell to be intense and foreboding. Likewise as you stand in acceptance before the gates of paradise one should be filled with light. With titles like ""wailing"" and ""gnashing"" you would expect massive musical arrangements to unfold as we stand transfixed between the gates of heaven & hell. This music should act as an intermediary between rapture and tragedy. No Sibyl songs here... Fripp synthesized his guitar beyond recognition into some hybrid church organ missing some bellows. Electric guitar organs wax and wane through a shallow soundscape. Never inciting feelings that might bring us closer to promiced divine realities."
4,Relaxing?,"Someone described this as relaxing background music. It would be a strange form of relaxation. Track 1 is 23 minutes of some of the most disturbing, unsettling music I can imagine (but see below). It's not quite atonal chaos - it has structure and form - but as an instrumental rendering of the misery of Hell I'd have to say it's very successful. It's not relaxing. It's a description of a state of being you don't want to get to, don't want to stay in, and don't want to remember.Track 2, on the other hand, settles into beauty and peace. I can't see anyone categorizing it as traditional Praise music - this is Fripp, after all - but it's praise music nonetheless. Nothing you're likely to hear in church, though...You'll wish track 3 was shorter. Track 3 is there to tell you that Fripp wanted to prove he could be more disturbing than track 1. It's a great success.Track 4 is beautiful, if odd. It's a little too playful to be purely ambient; it invites you to pay attention."
4,The Lightlessness of Power,"When restarting his solo career in earnest in 1994, Robert Fripp updated his Frippertronics technique with digital technology - instead of tapes - to create loops of sounds.The Soundscapes projects included six CD releases of new material and a ""single"" collection, which includes three selections from this release.The cutting-edge textures are oftentimes quite metallic and non-melodic, but Fripp is attempting to expand the potential of the electric guitar. Not for the faint of heart, the exploration delves deep into the darkness of the soul, but leaves the listener with the task of finding the way back home."
2,Ms. James,I guess it had a moral/plot. It was just a little predictable and too twisted which made it boring at times. Not worth $17.99 maybe should be priced at about $9.99.
1,dvd movie,"once again B U in crazy movie,watch twice and still fell asleep and the part I viewed allI could say was ""what the ....."" crazy and did not enjoy, maybe I look at it a third time and see if I can get a better understanding, BU needs to upgrade his character and the sisters, good bye"
3,Off This Path Before,"The title says it all. Not, not ""Off the Eaten Path,"" but ""Manifold Destiny : The One! the Only! Guide to Cooking on Your Car Engine"" by Chris Maynard and Bill Scheller. It was published over 10 years ago, I think, and is still available through Amazon. That book started the cooking-on-a-car-engine craze, and it was a big seller when it first came out.I first saw a recipe for poaching fish in the dishwasher in ""The Bluefish Cookbook"" by Greta Jacobs and Jane Alexander. That cookbook was very popular where I live (here in bluefish country), and once again, there was a time when everyone seemed to be having dinner parties built around fish-a-la-dishwasher.Having said all this, I like Bob Blumer, and his new book isn't bad. It's just that with his more surreal stuff, it's ""been there, done that."" And if he's heard of those other two books, he ought to give credit where it's due."
5,You'll want to eat him up!,"Saw Bob on Later Today, and had to buy this book! His creativity is amazing. He is inspired and inspiring. Moreover, he's the cutest guy I have ever seen. Bob, are you single (and straight)? If so, then I urge every woman on the planet to buy your books. Not only will they get great recipes, they'll also have loads of fodder for their fantasies."
2,"not original recording, well some are","this wanst really good, and most songs didnt sound like there orignals. there all re-mastered or something. some songs sound the same, but it might be becuase the artists got older or something. If you want a good reference, or someting to jog your memory of oldies music this would still work. its packaged ok."
1,Can I even write less than one star?,"This was the lamest, most boring movie I have ever seen. It was so bad I couldn't even laugh at it,it was just that bad. When the filmmaker put it together did he really imagine anyone would like it? Did he even like it? I highly doubt it. The acting and special effects were so poor I couldn't even begin to describe it. I should buy myself a digital camera and make a terrible movie; maybe I could just film myself getting out of bed everyday,seems about as good of an idea as Avalos making another film."
1,A total waste of time,"This is a terrible piece of [...] that isn't worth your time no matter who you are. The fact that it is shot on video makes it worse. Besides Cradle Of Fear, NOTHING good has EVER been SOV and this is no exception. Weak story, boring characters, terrible acting and laughable ""special effects"" all make this a total snore. Maybe if you're out of Valium or Xanax you could substitute a few minutes of this [...] but that's about it.I like low-budget movies, I don't like [...]low-budget movies a bad name. Perhaps we should institute a law that NOTHING except XXX movies should be allowed to be SOV, that would save a lot of trouble for a lot of people. Here's another idea, if you think you've got the makings of a good movie, [...]"
2,eh...,"I got this movie when the Hollywood Video by my house was going out of business... I had picked up 7 movies at 3 dollars a piece and was sure after reading the blurbs on the back of this one that I had hit the undiscovered jackpot (As i had felt grabbing ""sleepaway camp"" which I had already seen and loved"" Anyhoo.. so I get home and I load it up and sit back...the quality of sound and video is not the worst I've seen, the acting is some of the worst though, the best actor in the film said maybe 2 lines. I found the movie predictable and had lot's of ""tension"" built up but never went anywhere. In several scenes I found myself being ""anxious"" waiting for the ""BIG SCARE"" and then it just never came. The effects were decent most of the time but really not the best however there were maybe only 3 or 4 ""spooks"" ... I dunno, if yer out of movies to see, see it... I wouldnt spend more than the 3 I spent on it though."
1,THIS IS ONE HORRIBLE WASTE OF ENERGY,"All I can say about this film is DO NOT waste the money on it. The acting is incredibly horrible - the effects are so-so, the lighting is even worse (looks like they shot with existing light with very little sculptural lighting) and highlights are overexposed. You can tell that this waste of energy was not created on quality film or high quality digital. My girlfriend and I both fell asleep through it and continued it the next day (for justifying the expenditure) and turned it off before it ended. You would think AT LEAST they would have had a nice boob shot to make up for the lack of creativity everywhere else....BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! The actress/model they starred in it should have aimed a little higher. She's an attractive looking actress, and it's a shame she couldn't have been in a better movie. The plot of this is horrible....and I won't even go into it to bore you to death...all I can say is DON'T WATCH IT....stick with the classics."
1,Really BAD!!!,"Ok, I am very tolerant of B-movies and find most movies that I watch to be very interesting. This one is very terrible. It makes no sense and doesn't have a story line. Even the acting is bad. I don't say that about many movies, but this one deserves it. Move on to a better movie."
3,This is a very good *INDEPENDENT* film !,"The harsh reviews that this movie is getting on this page are simply un-called for! Before you can honestly rate this film & give amazon.com customers an informative review you have to know what your talking about. The horror genre is split up into sub-genre's so if you rate this film as a bad horror movie in general then your dishonest & being uninformative so please stop. If you rate this film as a bad INDEPENDENT film then thats your opinion & even though i would strongly disagree with that opinion,you still have every right to have it & express it in your review. I think this is a very good *INDEPENDENT* film!"
1,The best thing about this movie......,"The best thing about this movie is the case it came in. This is quite possibly the WORST movie I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong...I love some of the ""B"" rated movies from yester-year, they are classics....but this movie was just plain horrible. It looks like an eighth grader made it with his/hers parents video camera. This was the one and only time I ask my video store for a credit because the movie was unwatchable. I kept hoping it would get better...but it didn't, so I turned it off. Don't waste your money even renting it. It doesn't even deserve one star but since they didn't offer a zero I gave it a one."
1,MIXED UP,"The ghost of cowboy legend Tom Mix and his cohorts are the spirits in this washed out mess. A young couple hoping to make it in Hollywood as screenwriters find themselves mixed up with a bunch of Hollywood types and ghosts to boot. Paula Ficara plays the girl, Rachel, who has a history of a mental breakdown; Stephen Wastell is Kevin, her sweet boyfriend who becomes quite different once he is possessed by the spirit of Tom Mix.An interesting premise poorly executed and with virtually little scares or suspense. Another independent misfire."
3,Low budget fun.,"This movie had its moments. THe theme of the movie was very good but some of its execution needed work. As a B movie goes, I enjoyed watching it and my friends will enjoy borrowing it from me."
3,Not as bad as the negative reviews say,This movie is a nice attempt at a serious ghost story. Yes it is low budget but the scares are effective when used. The acting is good throughout. The ending heads almost into Twilight Zone territory. A solid effort and worth checking out.
2,Okay for what it tried to do *spoilers*,"The Ghosts of Edendale had one weird premise. Ghost producers are coming back to Hollywood to conquer it by possessing young people. Indy movies have the premises you just don't find in traditional movies. They got the two stars for originality.Special effects? Not so good. Weird ghost kids running around at supernatural speeds, and it looks like the kid was walking, but the special effects people intentionally blurred him and sped him up. And that's the limits of the special effects. At least there wasn't much?Good job with make up. The dead bodies looked like dead bodies. Insane people wandering the streets looked like they haven't bathed for months. Whoever did that knew what they were doing.Acting was decent, if not okay. They looked like they had fun.The drug references were really forced and added nothing to the movie.It was an okay movie to rent, and maybe to buy just to see what else they could do."
1,Piece of crap,This was a real piece of crap. I could only get thru about 12 minutes of it. The only reason I got it was that my interest was aroused after reading about it Western Clippings.
2,Ok story---stupid ending,"The movie is ok for being ultra low budget. The acting is low grade to poor...often wooden at times. It's the kind of acting you have to use your imagination with and then it becomes great acting. The plot is slow moving and is paced even slower with the acting.The only redeeming fact was a few of the ghost scenes were creepy. I liked the little boy staring through the broken fence. That was the creepiest.The end was confusing. I didn't understand why one of the leads was walking the streets crazed and the other driving a car there as if he had never been there before. I didn't get it, but then, by this point, it really doesn't matter."
1,Not Like Her Others,"I Love Rachel Gibson's books. I've read every one of them, but I have to say I was rather disappointed with this book. It was very slow and very difficult to get into. If you want to read a good Gibson book, read ""Truly Madly Yours"" and ""True Confessions"". Those two books were awesome and really kept you on your feet."
2,Don't buy this...,"I disliked both of the main characters. She was stupid enough to fall for him and he was a slimy user. (He reminded me of Scott Peterson, if that tells you anything).My copy went straight into the trash."
2,Juvenile,"It wasn't so much the bland writing or the feeling that I've read this story before, but that the hero and heroine seemed more like high school kids dealing with issues most likely found on the school playground than adults.Reactions were over the top, and at times I wanted to smack some sense into the heroine. I welcome a variety of characters in my literature, but Gabrielle was far too flighty and clueless for my taste. Joe was overbearing, pushy, and crude. Hey, love alpha males, just don't like reading about obnoxious ones. I couldn't buy the premise of how these two came together, or how they stayed together for that matter.If you're looking for a cleverly written book involving a flaky heroine and a tough as nails cop, then read Jennifer Crusie's ""Getting Rid of Bradley."" It's far more entertaining and believable."
2,Doesn't come close to her prior two books!,"I loved this author's prior two novels. However, this one just slightly engaged my interest. It never came together for me as a romance either plus I didn't particularly like the characters. Although this is my most recent ""read"" of hers, I already remember it in far less detail than her prior two novels! That is not a good sign."
4,"FUNNY, SEXY ROMP","Imagine a tiny female wielding a can of hairspray at her ""stalker"", bring him to the ground..........this is what happened to Police Det. Joe Shanahan while he was following Gabrielle Breedlove...police had reason to believe that she and her antique store partner, Kevin, stole a Monet painting and were going to sell it on the black market....... This book had wonderful, witty dialogue ..... however, I honestly didn't care for Joe's character....,he's not one I ever would have been attracted to, especially with his raunchy mouth...In spite of that, I found myself laughing outloud many times while reading it......It had cute one liners, energetic characters, good storyline, and quite a ""sexy"" read.....I'm sure this will appeal more to the younger, more liberal-minded readers.."
5,Loved this book!,"I just can't decide which one of Gibson's books is my all time favorite. This one comes so close to being at the top of my list. It takes off on page one and doesn't stop.....you will laugh, love and smile your way through this story. Best hero and heroine yet. I loved everything about them AND Ms. Gibson's writing."
4,A fast-paced and light romance to indulge in!,"Undercover cop Joe Shanahan suspects that Gabrielle Breedlove is somewhat involved in the robbery of an antique painting. When Gabrielle blows his cover, Joe is forced to pose as her boyfriend - for he is convinced that Gabrielle's colleague is the one responsible for the occurrence. A New Age enthusiast, Gabrielle senses sensuous auras underneath Joe's straight-laced and unfriendly facade. So, it must be love - or is it?This is a romantic tour de force to devour in one sitting. Rachel Gibson is above most of today's contemporary romance writers. This is a fast-paced and light romantic comedy to indulge in during the dog days of summer. Are you in the bargain for a light summer read? Pick up this wonderful book!"
4,"Girls, Im loving Rachel Gibson!!!!!","Ok, OK, so this was no ""See Jane Score"" , but oh was it fun!! Rachel Gibson is a new find for me and Im soo excited about it!! What a delightful author!! I absolutely loved Gabrielle..she was sooo likeable...I was rooting for her from start to finish..I will say that at times Joe drove me crazy, but for the most part I adored him as well..this was a thoroughly enjoyable book and I would recommend it without hesitation!!"
4,Great Laughs!!!!,"This book was great and filled with laughs. Then again what do you expect when you mix a New Age thinking (well... sometimes), lapsed vegeterian, and a cynical detective who has a Jerry Springer loving bird?Joe and Gabrielle are as opposite as can be and as a result there is plenty of laughs and good times, and of course romance.This book is a must read for anyone who loves happily ever afters with plenty of smiles."
5,A must READ!,What can I say. This book was one of the best I have read in a long time. The characters were real and funny. The sex was hot hot hot! The dialoge had me laughing out loud. I didn't want it to end. Rachel Gibson is on the top of my list. Can't wait to read her other books. Not sure if anything can top this one. It was great!
4,Fun romantic comedy with a dash of suspense,"Undercover detective Joe Shanahan is trailing new age gal Gabrielle Breedlove as he suspects that she may be in cahoots with her partner Kevin, a suspected art thief. When she gets the jump on Joe (with a can of hairspray no less), and blows his cover, he regroups and poses as her lover to gain access to investigate Kevin. Sparks start to fly around them as they both fight the inevitable, and he starts to believe in her innocence. But can he really fall for such a kooky character?One of Gibson's oldies but goodies, this is one of her quirkiest romances. Joe is a total ""just the fact, ma'am"" kind of guy, while Gabby is into auras, karma, and aromatherapy. They are polar opposites, but pretty passionate. I loved the first meeting and all the interaction between them. Just wished Joe would get his act together sooner.Tracy Vest, September 2008"
5,Rachel does it again!,"""It must be love"" didn't disappoint me in the least. When Joe tries to arrest Gabrielle everything gets hotter. Gabe won't give in and Joe won't give up...but the ending is well worth the wait!"
1,dissapointed,"one of the reason's why i enjoyed rachel gibson's books are because they arn't the run-of-the-mill types of romanace novels. they have a glimmer of reality in them. i felt let down by it must be love because unlike the rest of her books-it wasn't devoloped and wasn't believable. just because your into aromatherapy and believe in karma doesn't make you this new age hippie freak that joe seems to think gabrielle was. she seemed very down to earth and normal to me. the character overreacted for the sake of the plot- which wasn't even that devoloped. all in all, i was dissapointed, especially after reading truly madly yours which was believable as well as funny."
2,"Love Rachel Gibson, but not this book!","I have been on a huge Rachel Gibson kick lately- started with See Jane Score and just kept reading her from then on! I have read 8 of her books in the last two weeks...most I read in 1 day or 2 at the most. It Must Be Love was slow from the start. I just didn't get sucked in like I have with all of her other books. It took me 5 days to finish this book and I almost just stopped but I hate not finishing a book. It just isn't very good. The plot is simple, the characters were ok, the writing was fine...just kind of blah. If you are a Rachel Gibson fan, skip this one. If you have never read her before, give one of her other books a shot. She is a great storyteller, but this book just isn't worth it."
5,All the RAVE,If all true love could start with hairspray and a hand gun. It was one of Rachel's better books. Enjoyed.
4,A sweet romantic story,"I really enjoyed this little book.The characters were likeable and realistic, and you couldn't help but empathize with the heroine and fall for the hero.This is not a complicated story, nor is it particularly engaging, but the romance really is, especially towards the end. ""It must be love"" made me happy and it relaxed me, which is precisely what I was looking for. I found myself rooting for the both of them and wishing the book did not have to end."
3,Rachael don't rush!,"I fell in love with the first two wacky, wonderful books from this author and eagerly awaited this one. I was dissapointed. Although the the characters were fun, they were not as well developed as the ones in her previous two books. I'm not sure if Ms. Gibson has a quota to meet, but I think she would better serve her fans (yes, I still am one) if she would make her next story as well thought out as her first. This book is not terrible by any stretch, but if you are hoping for the hilarity and steamy quality of her first two, you will probably be dissapointed."
1,Test Strips,"I purchased this product a while back. This product should not have been sold since it had exhaused its shelf life. By the time I recieved it, there was only 2 weeks left to expire. I did not use any of it."
3,a Sino-Latino hero,"Dr. Chang-Diaz is Asian and Latino. In this work, you learn about his trip into outer space. You also find out about his research on Earth. This shows his wife and daughter too. It's not minority-specific, but it may inspire youngsters of color to reach for the stars. The narrator deGrasse-Tyson is a role model in that multi-culti way too. This may be great viewing for science classes, especially in urban settings, in elementary and junior high schools."
3,Fly Eagles Fly,These are cool looking towels but not towels to be used...more for decoration purposes due to the emblem fading with the first wash.
5,Great collection of great concertos,"Anne-Sophie Mutter is one of the finest violinists of our time. Her tone is powerful and sensitive, and her technique is superb. Like the title suggests, these are some of the greatest concertos written for violin; Mutter plays these masterpieces with her own distinct style and musicality."
1,This is not a projector only the lamp,Please do not order this item. It is not the Hitachi projector but only the lamp for it. I have ordered it twice now from two sellers (the other seller removed the item from Amazon after my order as they said that it was the wrong product & that Amazon put it instead of the lamp. I ordered from the 2nd seller & again received only the lamp again--very frustrating!
3,"Decent jacket, nothing special","This jacket is pretty heavy and thick. It is very simple and doesn't have any unique design like 3in1 jackets. I find the bib to be pretty annoying because even though it looks nice when zipped up with the jacket, when it isn't the bib looks stupid because it is attached right to the lining. The ""fleece"" is feels more like synthetic wool and has a rougher feel to it. It works well as a winter jacket and at under $50, its a bargain. Overall, the design is plain and simple, the quality is mediocre."
2,Hold down clip doesn't attach to coffee maker,The hold down clip doesn't attach to the coffee maker. I used the spring and stopper to fix my old one and now have a working pot.
1,DID NOT FIT. Buyer beware Not for Cuisinart 1200 Cofffee Maker!!!,The basket has an extra lip on the outside that dose not allow it to fit into the slot of the machine and lock in. I have the Cuisinart 1200 coffee maker so I don't understand why they are saying this basket is for this machine which it isn't. Better off getting it from the Cuisinart site and paying the shipping and getting the RIGHT filter. Not worth spending the extra money sending back but some how I think they know that. Scam! Buyer beware
1,Minor Design Change,Product at some point had a redesign ~ the finger-loop handleis offset ~10 deg from original filter basket and doesn't fit coffee maker.
3,It's a coffee filter basket ...,"... with a springy thingy on the bottom that works ... vs. the original one that came with my Cuisinart DCC-1200, which no longer worked. What more is there to say? A new, working one is better than an old non-working one. It's just nice to know that I can buy replacement DCC-1200 filter baskets and carafes (and virtually anything else on the planet) via Amazon into the next millennium."
3,Disappointed,"This filter basket did not fit well, but we've managed to make it work. It would be nice if replacement products were easier to find, and not so ridiculously high in price."
4,loved the ancedotes,"Each poem is like a short story. My favorite poem had to be ""We Are Written in the Heavens."" Its a great bedtime read when your in a funk about love."
4,A beautiful tale through prose and poetry,"As a woman who has struggled in relationships and experienced highs and lows in love, this book spoke of the very essence of that struggle and journey. I found much comfort in this book and in the end it leaves a reader with a sense of hope."
5,Gene Autry Is Great,"In These songs I listen to them on cassete, From Up on the rooftop when Santa comes down the ""Chimnley"" To the santa claus is comin' to town with the horrible doll that says ""MAMA"". But all the songs are GREAT most of them I never even heard."
5,Thanks for the Memories,"No one sings these novelty Christmas songs like Gene Autry. This brought back a lot of warm and wonderful childhood memories. So nice to remember when...life was easier and full of fantasy of flying reindeers, dancing snowmen, and a Chubby Little Fellow called Santa Claus!"
4,Reasonably impressed,"As a fan of the series, I thought I'd go ahead and check out the book. Artistically it is well done, though I'd say some of the scenes are very confusing visually. There is just so much detail there's just too much noise in some of the scenes. That, and it seemed to read ""too quick"". I don't know, it just seemed like I breezed through it very quickly. Once again, well done with just a few small complaints. Thumbs up!"
4,Epic storyline and fantastic art,Vol. #1 of the Neon Genesis Evanelion series starts off with a bang as teenager Shinji Ikari finds himself swept into the midst of an epic battle with the fate of humanity hanging on its outcome. Fans of the animated series will love the additional detail offered within these manga pages and those who haven't yet seen the televised versions will find this first volume a terrific way to get aquainted with the series.Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's artwork is first rate stuff with every panel packed with oodels of graphic detail. The pacing of the overall storyline is also well done as most readers will no doubt breeze effortlessly through all 176 action packed pages.
4,Interesting,"I've heard so much about Evangelion, and, wanting to read more manga, I delved into the first book. I found that the images had too much clutter, but when I realized that the manga was written to create hype for the show, I could see that they just adapted some of the television cells into the book, and that's why it seemed that some of the images weren't clear in black and white.The story seems to start off pretty well, albeit with some cliches. I'm not sure where it's taking me, but I found myself initially trudging along, but once the mecha were introduced, I was hooked so much that I didn't realize I finished the book so quickly!I certainly plan on checking out the rest of the manga series, as well as the corresponding anime."
2,Poles broke easily,"The flag itself was very good material and very nice, but the plastic poles were terrible. I hadn't traveled more than 30 miles before the flag snapped off of my car . Very disappointed that I spent money on two of these flags and I got to see them in use for a total of an hour."
2,Not pleased,"Not pleased with product because it broke off after only about 25 miles of driving. Flag material is very good, but plastic pole and mounting material is inferior."
5,High Quality Flag,The flag was much nicer than what I expected. My Father-in-law is an avid Clemson fan driving 2 hours each way to attend every home football game and several weekend basketball and baseball games each year. He also drives to several road games each season. His current flags are tattered and torn from several thousand miles of highway driving. This Flag is double layered and seems to be much higher quality than the past flags. I have a feeling they will last substantially longer. I was very happy to see the quality of construction and materials. Would definitely spend a little more for the better product.
4,Nice product,"I ordered this screen a couple weeks ago and I have no problems with it. I like the image quality and I got a good deal for it being a 20""."
1,Terrible CD,"The majority of this CD is rerecorded, and most of them sound terrible. Do not buy this CD"
2,Not worth the $$,"I was very dissatisfied with this monitor...the battery doesnt hold a charge at all...even after 24 hours of charging...the picture isnt very clear (maybe I expected too much?)...reception is lousy if you have a cordless phone, wireless network or cell phone nearby (and who doesn't, these days?). I was very disappointed in the quality of this item, especially considering the price."
1,Ours is also losing the sound after only 1 year,"It's never been dropped or abused and yet similar to another reviewer, our monitor is losing the sound more and more. It goes in and out when the volume knob is turned. We have only had this a year and paid $176 for it. WAY too high priced for this kind of thing to happen. I would expect this from a $50 monitor not one that costs nearly two hundred."
1,Works for about 6 months -- then the battery dies,"Given how expensive this product is, I was shocked to find that within 3-4 months of having owned it, the battery life started to quickly wither down. After 6 months, you could no longer use the wireless monitor without being physically plugged in. It has gone from being a wireless monitor to an entirely wired monitor. The battery at this point holds NO charge at all. It won't even last for 10 seconds without dying if it's not plugged in. I have complained to Summer Customer care and will see if they fix this (if they do, I will revise my rating, since otherwise, the product is good)."
1,Do Not Buy unless you want the whole Neighborhood to see your baby,"DO Not buy this product unless you want the whole neighborhood to see your baby. At midnight one night I got a static feed and when it cleared I was looking at another baby, not mine that was right across the hall. When I called Summer's ""Fantastic"" customer service they basically said that's the way it works and I was out of luck. This is really expensive and not worth it."
2,Owned two and both died,"Although I have LOVED being able to see and hear my baby, I have not liked the fact both monitors (the second purchased after the first one started failing) have broken within a little over a year of purchase. The video basically starts flipping vertically or doesn't come on at all. There has to be some kind of manufacturing flaw for them to both die in the same way at about the same time following purchase.I am now addicted to being able to see my child but will be trying the new digital mobi cam when it ships. Hopefully it will have a longer life than either of the monitors I have purchased from Summer."
2,Terrible range,What a scam! Yet another completely overpriced device for what it is and does. If you live in a building of any substance (brick walls for example) this monitor has a range of 20-30ft. It's completely useless. Unfortunately all these baby monitors suffer from this limitation. And there's really no reason. In the UK they sell two way walkie talkies with a room monitoring function. You can be at your neighbor's and still here your baby's breathing. And they cost $80.
1,"Clumsy, radio interference and signal errors",_We send back two of these before realizing that the problem was the model itself. Almost constant radio interference and signal errors (like white noise. We bought the Levana Babyview 20 in stead which works preally well. Also it is less clumsy than the Summer one.
2,Not usable- Static sound-,"Bought this based on the positive reviews posted here. Yet, we started getting static sound (can't hear baby crying anymore) only after a month of purchase.. very diasppointed with the quality of this product."
2,Poor video quality,"I bought this monitor after reading a bunch of good reviews, but we were very disappointed in the performance. The picture quality is very poor and the monitor is difficult to view from various angles. The screen would not operate on battery power after the first week of use. We bought a Q-see monitor for $99 from Costco and have been much happier with the performance and picture quality.Pros:1. adjustable camera angles to accomodate various mounting positions2. little interferenceCons:1. poor image quality2. limited video capability in battery mode3. poor contrast on monitor4. expensive"
4,"Useful monitor, decent value","Handheld monitor is good for those who move around the house a lot. The range is surprisingly good. I even used it at a hotel to check on how our babysitter was doing (from the lobby to the fourth floor). You can only get color in full lighting, but the night vision is decent. Not a cheap monitor, but an okay value."
3,Baby Monitor,Great to be able to see and hear the baby. The static drives me nuts though. I don't know if it's a bad device or it's the norm. You won't be able to sleep with it on.
4,Very good!,"I am a bit of a gadget junkie and I found the night vision option on this remote to be very tempting. The clarity is quite good, although night vision appears in black and white. The reception is clear throughout all levels of our large colonial home and even into the driveway.Used multiple times daily for eight months, I believe it has paid for itself. Had to velco it to the top of the crib recently as the baby pulled up and knocked it over - must have wanted a bit of privacy..."
4,Awesome camera and monitor,"Lasted almost 2 years after dropping the monitor over a dozen times. Camera still works but the monitor finally died. The camera is great especially with the night vision. Only has 2 channels so if you live in a Apartment or Townhouse setting you will get serious interference or pick up other baby cameras, which I find funny and scary. We live in the country and have one neighbor with no children so worked like a dream. If you use old cordless phones you also might get interference. Over all it did it's job and we would purchase again for our next baby for sure."
2,WILL break,"For us it lasted almost two years, so I suppose we're supposed to be happy. Though at almost two hundred dollars back in 2010, it still feels like we didn't get our money's worth. Now they want us to pay $80 for a refurbished unit with a six-month warranty. The process for getting the replacement is pretty streamlined, but that should tell you something about HOW MANY of their products break once outside the warranty period.***July 2012 update -- now the refurb unit is mostly broken. Lasted five months."
1,Stopped working with little use,"I purchased this monitor before my daughter was born as I had heard from other parents that video monitors were helpful and this one wasn't too pricey compared to some. However, I only used it once or twice until my daughter was about 11 months. At this point I began to use it 3-4 times per week for her naps and while it was working I was pleased with it. Then it stopped working when she was about 13 months old. First the video went out, but I still had the sound, then about a month later the sound stopped working, too. At that point I contacted summer infant to see if they could help me to figure out what was wrong or give me a full or partial refund or a new unit. This was in September, it is now January and I have still not heard from them. I would not recommend this product due to its lack of longevity and complete absence of customer service."
3,Note when adding Second Camera,"There are lots of review on this camera so I'll keep it to the one point that I did not see commented.Got this camera and a second camera unit to keep an eye on the children. There is an A / B switch that can be used to switch viewing between 2 cameras. The thing to note here is that you can only listen to 1 channel also. That means, monitoring two kids in separate rooms, you can only hear 1. This became a bit of a problem at night. Had to supplement with a sound monitor. Then I'd can switch between the two cameras to get a visual."
2,Too much static,This monitor had way too much static. I could not stand it so I returned it. I wish that someone had warned me that I could barely hear my child because the static was so bad. I would not recommend this monitor.
2,not so great...,"I was very excited to receive this monitor and when we got done with the charging for 18hrs and got ready to use it, it was horrible we could not see any picture all we got out of it was sound. Save you Money!"
1,First one video didn't work - second one almost complete interference,I've now purchased 2 of these. The first one we took with us on vacation and the video monitor screen failed. I thought it was a fluke and retured it.The second one I purchased about two months ago and is completely useless. It is entirely static because of some interference with either the cordless phone or the wireless internet connection in my house.
1,I can not seem to get it.,"Unfortunately, I was not able to get good reception. It does not seem to work as advertised."
1,A Piece of JUNK!!!,"The picture is great if you want to sit and stare at the monitor like you would dial a phone. You must be very close to see what's going on. Lots of Interference. But when you get good reception, the audio is incredibly clear! A little color during the times of bright daylight. The video portion broke on the fourth day. Will return and exchange for another brand!!! If it seems a little too good to be true... It is!"
4,Need more sleep...get one of these!,"At first, I thought it overbearing or unnecessary to have a video monitor. What happened to the olden days when they didn't have anything? Well, my thoughts have changed. I love this monitor! I can peek in on my daughter with out disturbing her. And at night when she is fussing in her sleep, I can check on her with out getting out of bed. As a new and first time mom...I need to stay in ""sleep mode"" as long as possible. The monitor works great. I did have to move my cell phone and charger off the same table as the video monitor but the relocation was worth the advantage the monitor gives me at night. Every once in a while I will get a little static but it's nothing compared to our first monitor. As for the ""color"" monitor...at night you can't see the color...but that wasn't a big deal to me. I can see my baby and that's what matters...I already now she is dressed Pretty in Pink ;~) This monitor is well worth the money!"
3,Open Mind,"I spent a fortune on these monitors, but it still won't tell you if your baby stops breathing. You'd have to be right there to see it. I found peace of mind when I purchased an ANGEL CARE MONITOR. It does not have a tv, but it sets off an alarm if it does not sense movement (breathing) for 20 seconds. Now, that is peace of mind!"
4,I love this monitor,"I got this monitor as a gift from my cousin and I love it! I didnt think I needed a video monitor until I had one. You never have to get up in the middle of the night, or go upstairs when your hanging out, to make sure your baby is breathing. You can see and hear right there! The picture isnt great, but definately usable... and I have no other point of reference, I dont know if the other monitors have better pictures or not???"
2,Not all that is says it is........,"The reception for this monitor is horrible. My bedroom is 2 rooms away from my daughters and the receptions cuts in and out. When it cuts out, it makes this awful noise. There is NO color to this monitor. I wish I had bought another one"
1,Useless,"Personally, I have been very unhappy with this monitor. I bought one from Amazon recently. When it arrived, no matter what I did it wouldn't get any picture. Both the Channels were interchanged, meaning that the camera would have to be set on one channel and the handset on the other to get ""any"" picture or audio.I thought that I had recevied a lemon and got a replacement from Amazon. After receiving the second unit, i didn't face the problem with the swapping of the channels ( or I wouldn't have known ) because it wouldn't get any picture on either channels.I have to say the audio part of the monitor worked well in both the units, but why pay $182 for an audio monitor?So, personally I cannot give this one a good review based on my experience. I am however very impressed with the replacement policy and the easy procedure from Amazon. KUDOS to Amazon...."
3,good quality but beware...,"This is a great monitor, we bought it to monitor our first baby and the video/audio quality is excellent.. It even works with good reception between multi-floor house and even from outside the house.The only thing that I would say is pretty badly designed is the fact that if your next door neighbor has the same unit the signal from his unit would show up on your monitor and you'd be looking at his kids and vice-versa.. I think this is a bad design and security risk and should be corrected."
5,great picture and portability,"when we were looking at monitors, this one was definitly the one we wanted. the others didn't compare with all of the features this one offered. we were so excited to use it when we recieved it for our shower, we used it on our dog while he was in his cage in the basement to try to figure out why the cage was always sopping wet while we were out. i don't know why the other reviews are giving it a not so great rating because when we were checking out our dog, it worked in our driveway while we pulled out! now that our son was born, we use it on him and really like it. the picture is very clear, my husband even saw him spit up! i love the portability and the sound lights (for when i want him to cry a little but not listen to break my heart). the picture works all over our house and even in the dark. we would recommend this, definitly, to those who could afford it and for those who want the best!"
4,Works like a charm!,"We got this after a traumatic month of sleep training. I now wish i had gotten it sooner, instead of the regular sound monitor. It really does provide peace of mind."
2,900 Hz is not good enough,"I bought this monitor and it functions ok. We are looking to selling it and buy another brand that has a stronger reception. We have a 3700 Sqft home and does not work everywhere in the house....not good..When our 900 hz phone is used, it kills unit."
2,"Worked for 6 months, now it is a sound monitor.","When it worked, it was pretty good. Don't expect too much. The video quality is at best comparable with but still inferior to a cheap $15 webcam. But, it does let you know what your baby is doing. However, this product is far less relaible than a cheap webcam. After 6 months, out of no reason (I didn't change any thing, didn't touch the camera), the video is scrambled, and I can only receive scrambled video from the receiver on channel A while the transmitter is on chanel B. So, it is pretty much a sound monitor now."
1,No Range,This was the second video monitor we purchased. The range and video quality were horrible! the picture was all grainy hard to see and the range was ridiculous. Literally walked out of one room and the signal died.
2,Works for a year...,"We purchased this product in December 2009. We have been happy with its reception and the screen nice. However, after about a year we had to order a replacement charger because the charger connector broke. Then after about 15 months, the speaker began to die. We now have to spend 2-3 minutes adjusting the volume button to get anything but silence. We do run a white noise machine in our baby's room when he is sleeping, so the speaker gets lots of use, but I expected such an expensive to last as long as I would want to monitor my child. When I called customer service today (and sat on hold for 30 minutes) I was told it is out of its one year warranty so the best they could do was to let me purchase a refurbished version of the same monitor from their website. Moral of the story, if you expect to need a monitor more than a year, this is probably not the one for you."
2,Very dissapointing,"I agree with the other reviews. The reception and picture on this monitor is HORIBLE! I have a 5 inch video monitor for my first child and wanted another for my newborn. I like the portability aspect of the handheld unit, but honestly, it is not worth the high cost. My 5 inch monitor is crystal clear but the 2.5 inch handheld is practically indecipherable."
2,After a year poor volume control,"After about a year of using the monitor the volume control wheel has problems. As you turn it or sometimes when it is sitting on the table the volume will cut in and out like there is a short circuit in the volume knob. The first one, after about 9 months, we returned to Summer and they replaced it with no problem. The second one is doing the same thing so we are going to try to replace it. However I think we've had it just over a year so I don't know if they will.Other than that is it a great product."
4,Great for the price!,"I was debating on getting a video monitor for our second child. Our friends got one, and they loved it. Having a video monitor does save on ""sneaking a peak"" and inadvertantly waking the sleeping one with a squeaky floor! I searched and searched, and settled on this one because it was the same model as other summer infant deluxe monitors, but was much cheaper. Probably because the shipping date was listed as a few months from the time of purchase. That was fine b/c we weren't expecting the new baby for several months. The great thing was it shipped early. So now we are playing with it watching our 2 year old.The picture is fine...we do have a wireless network in the house and it does not affect it. The sound is not as clear as our original digital monitor (there is some static when turned up). OH well, we still can hear if the child wakes, and if I get really anal i can turn it up and hear breathing..."
2,Can hear neighbor's phone coversations!,"I really was in love with this product until my next door neighbors started talking on their phone every night at my daughter's bedtime! We've had it about 3 months and for the past 4 weeks, we've been having this problem. The video turns to awful static as soon as they get a dial tone and I can hear their entire conversation from the first number they dial until they hang up! Of course I'm polite and turn off the monitor until I think they might be done talking, but it's almost as if I am on the phone with them too when I have it on! With only 2 channels to pick from, it's pretty much impossible to avoid this problem! It also picks up interference from truckers going by. The weird thing is that it doesn't pick up MY cordless phone conversations, even though my phone is a 2.4 Ghz model. If I had known interference was going to be this big of a problem I would not have purchased this product."
3,Not worth the money,"This does work well if you do not have a 900mhz cordless phone or other cordless or wireless products in your home or a close neighbor. The ""color"" is only during the day and it is not vivid. Do not go by the picture on the box! When you do get good reception it is a clear picture and the portable feature is nice. However, be careful b/c many items interfere with the reception."
2,Expected Better,"I was so excited to purchase the video monitor! Although I was a little disappointed with the quality of the performance. There was an extremely large amount of intereance and my daughers room was only about 100 feet away. For $200 I had higher expectations. I just returned this item and have purchaed the Mobicam 2.4gh Handheld, which has more features, voice activated video (which I thought was a huge plus), longer range, you can add 3 additional cameras. I found it at Target for $159. Great Buy! Don't waste your time with this one learn from my mistake and by the Mobicam."
3,"Great, if you don't live in the NYC Area","We bought this product, as we live in a two level garden apartment in the NYC area. We brought it home and was able to see the full crib and we loved it! Once the baby was in the crib, we noticed that there was feedback with the sound. You can hear him cry on the monitor, but we have to keep the sound down, to avoid the feedback. We are now facing the hot and humid months of summer and are finding that we will have to purchase a regular sound monitor, as doors will be closed and there will be an air conditioner in his room.I am sad that we spent all this money, only to have to spend more on another monitor. :-("
1,I can see and hear into my neighbors house!,I can actually see and hear into my neighbors home! It picked up our neighbor's signal which is creepy to think they can watch us with our baby. Not secure!!!
1,Never received it.,"I never received the product, the supplier is supposed to ship a replacement weeks ago and still haven't received it. Customer service is aweful!!!!"
2,not worth the money,"I would not buy this monitor again. It picks up so much static that I can't even use it. I have to use my cheap fisher-price monitor to pick up sound, but I do use the video on this monitor. I have to say that the video is excellent, however the static it picks up is a lot. I have to use 2 monitors every time."
5,Love it!,"This monitor is FANTASTIC! And the screen is bigger than some others. Quality is great and after using this for 6 months, I would certainly buy it again if I were doing it over. The video monitor saves alot of trips upstairs to check on the baby in the middle of the night - the extra sleep I get in my own bed makes this worth every penny!"
2,Not worth the money,"We received this monitor as a very generous gift from my parents at our baby shower and I was thrilled to have the video and audio features in a monitor. The monitor has lost it's picture after only a year and the overall quality of this less than expensive product is not worth the money in my opinion. Also, the company does not offer a replacement monitor, they only offer a replacement camera which is not helpful when the montior, which is often moved from room to room in our house is what takes the wear and tear, whereas the monitor remains immobile for the most part and would often not need replacing. I would have registered for a different product had I read some of these ""lower star"" reviews prior. I won't be purchasing a Summer product again."
3,hang on to your receipt,"I have had pretty good luck with this monitor. I get good reception and get a good picture (color in bright light situations and good night vision). However, I did have a bad cord initially, which I paid $10 to replace. After that the battery stopped holding a charge, which was another $10. They say it would have been covered under the warranty if I had kept the receipt. I'm hoping this is the end of my problems, because I could have loved this thing if all had worked well."
5,Great Video Monitor,"I purchased a different brand video monitor and it was horrible- bad reception, small screen. This monitor is wonderful! The picture is perfect, the monitor is very portable and I don't wake my son up to check on him during his naps anymore!"
5,See it all!,"We love this monitor as it provides a very good picture of what is happening while your baby/toddler is sleeping, or more importantly, not sleeping! When you hear a noise, you can see what it is. If you hear crying, you can see if it's necessary to actually go to your child or not. And sometimes it's just fun to watch what happens when they're alone and don't know you can see them. We're very pleased with the monitor and highly recommend it."
1,Not very reliable,We bought this monitor for our babies and were sorry we did. The sound & picture are of extremely poor quality and it even stopped working after a few months. We had to throw it away. This product is highly NOT recommended to monitor babies.
1,Worst costumer service ever!,"I bought two monitors because I was expecting twins. When the monitors arrived only one of them worked. So I was told to send the faulty monitor back to them because they were going to replace it. My children are now 2 1/2 years old and I never received it back( I sent it back two months before my due date). I called a thousand times, left more than 15 voice mail messages and countless e-mails.I was ripped off! there is not other way to put it.....ah did I mention every time I talked to a customer care representative they would say "" it has been shipped already "" or ""We will shipped it"" or ""they will look in to it"" at least stick to one story."
4,Works Well,"Works well for us with good reception throughout 2 story 3200 sq ft house. A bit of static for a few seconds once in a while, probably depending on position of receiver. It does have a background hiss which is not hard to sleep with.Have 802.11 Pre-N router and 5.8 Ghz cordless phones also which do not seem to interfere."
4,Good buy,"works well, clearer picture than we thought. However there needs to be an option upon purchase, to purchase an extended warranty. I think this is essential with a product like this."
4,great peice of mind at night,"The thing I really liked about this was as a first time Mom I am able to see what the little gal is doing without getting up every 30 seconds. It is nice to just tap the button and see what she is doing. The video quality is a bit poor but I didn't expect to be able to see much with a night vision camera. We have a night-light in the room and leave a nearby bathroom light on so the night pic is easy to see. I think the ability to see her without getting up in nice otherwise I would be in her room all night checking on her. We also have a highly ""teched up"" house and we do get interference but that was to be expected."
2,not as good as the original,"For my first child I got the black and white video monitor from Summer. We love it. The only problem is that it is annoying to carry around the house with you. We purchased the new ""color"" portable model when we had our second child. It is definitely not color. Also, I find the screen to be so small that it is difficult to see anything. We returned it. We now have 2 of the original models...one for each baby's room. You need to keep them on different channels obviously. Reception is a problem in certain areas of our house when you have them both hooked up, but it just requires a little adjusting."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","We were so excited to get this monitor home and try it for our little one. The reception is horrible and I can't be anywhere in the house especially on the computer and see her. There is no color what so ever, black and white only. Don't waste your money, I'll be returning it today."
4,It Works,I read where a 2.4 mhz telephone would interfere with a similar frequency baby monitor so I went with the 900 mhz sumer infant. It works so I am pleased with its performance.
5,My friends and neighbors are jealous,I absolutely love this monitor. When my daughter was young and first moved into her crib I was able to keep the monitor next to my bed and check on her without getting up.THe reception is pretty good. I can go to my neighbors yard. The picture is not the most amazing but it gets the job done without me having to go up and down the stairs to check on her.Worth the extra money just for peace of mind.
5,we love it!,"my husband and i registerd for this product thinking no one would buy it for us - however, we are sure glad we did! my sister ended up getting it for us and we love it! it's nice how we can see her and make sure she's ok with or without the noise. leaving a monitor on loud enough so you can hear her is sometimes still too loud. it's nice to watch a movie or something with my husband without that static sound, but be able to see her at the same time. we recommend it!"
2,"Great idea, poor execution","We purchased this monitor after deciding the black and white model was not convenient because the monitor was too big. The idea of a handheld monitor was perfect. However, we had a lot of trouble with the reception and kept getting a lot of static wherever we had the receiver. During the night, the receiver would randomly blare static, which made sleeping using it very annoying. We ended up sending it back and scrapping the whole video monitor idea. We now use a regular non-video one and have no trouble. I decided I didn't need to see the baby all the time after all."
3,Sound cuts out after awhile,"This was a great monitor in the beginning. My daughter is now 17 months old, and the hand held device started having issues with the sound shorting out with the volume dial after about 8 months of use. Quite annoying, but other than that, its a decent monitor. The video screen is great, and works great at night with its night vision on the camera. Its wall mountable, so I hang the camera on the all above my daughters crib so I can see her well at night. I just wish the sound worked better. Sometimes I'll wake in the middle of the night only to find out the sound is off, and I worry if I missed hearing her cry or coughing.. Not sure if anyone else has had the same issues or not. Over all, its an ""ok"" buy.. Just seems slightly cheaply made with how bad it shorts out in sound."
2,Great when it worked,"Yeah, when it worked it was great, which was only for the first 8 months. Of course I didn't have an original receipt as it was a baby gift so Summer wouldn't replace it with the same color screen device. Instead I got a B&W screen device, refurbished, that was so blurry it made me more nervous looking at it because I could never make out what was my baby and what was her bed. Three months later the screen on this one stopped working.... ugh."
5,Works well in an old Victorian,"Our current low-end sound only baby monitor was not working in this house, even to the next room. In fact I have trouble with my wireless router (I have one on the first floor and one in the attic to overcome dead spots). I'm assuming chimneys, heavy plaster walls and distance are all factors. However 2.4 GHz phones have always worked fine, no matter where they are located.I plugged in the camera over the crib (on the second floor) and took the receiver downstairs. It worked perfectly. For the real test, I went into the basement, and to my delight the picture and sound was fine.Night vision also works fine. Don't set expectations too high on picture clarity. It's not meant for videoconferencing; but for monitoring a baby this unit works great."
3,Almost what we desired,"First, let me say that my biggest complaint about this product probably could have been avoided with more research. We have this system plus the additional camera so that we can monitor two children. The system does not have a scan function (or any means of monitoring the two cameras simultaneously). As a result, it doesn't meet my needs.Otherwise, the picture clarity (even in a completely dark room) is pretty good especially for the size of the screen. The audio is also very clear. We do get occasional interference which is really loud static and a temporary loss of picture (wakes me up at least 1-2 times per night!). Previously, we had a standard audio monitor and had very few problems with any interference so I'm not sure what makes this unit so sensitive. Overall, this is something I expect with a monitor so it wasn't surprising.The camera feature has provided us with more ""entertainment value"" than I expected - our toddler is a acrobat in bed!"
1,Total Piece of Junk,"My wife and I ordered this monitor to watch out daughter as we transitioned her from a crib to a regular bed. The monitor only gives a decent picture if the monitor and receiver are very, very close to each other (i.e. The Same Room!). Our bedroom is directly over our daughter's room and the picture quality is awful. I would not recommend anybody purchase this monitor."
1,UPSET AT SUMMER COMPANY,"I purchased this monitor this past February, it worked fine until last night. As usual, I put my son to sleep for the night and when I went to turn on the monitor it had a blue screen. No matter what I tried it did not help. I called the company and they stated that I had to send it back in and if they find it is my fault I would just have to pay full price. I did nothing to the camera. The base stays in the same place all the time and neither piece has ever been dropped or damaged in any way. So I have to pay for shipping and wait without a camera for them to figure out if it is my fault. What kind of customer service is that. This was my first and last Summer product."
4,Its a good video monitor for the price,I'm sure its not the best video monitor out there but it might be the best one for the price. It works well to keep an eye on my daughter from the other room while I am working. I only wish it had a wider viewing angle to see more areas in the room.
3,Love the Product - Hate the Lifespan and Support at Summer,I really enjoyed my monitor - we used it off and on for about 15 months. Our son slept in a room attached to our own - so we didn't need the monitor on during the night - however we put him down before we went to bed and used the monitor most nights for an hour or two. Everything went well until last week when the video capability completely stopped working. We are technically capable folks and still can't seem to find a reason why the screen is black.I have written to the company on several occasions to ask and see if they provide any sort of refurbishment etc to no avail. Just crickets from their end.We didn't have problems with reception etc. So if you don't want something to last for years this is a great product.
4,Great but not perfect,"As a former nanny turned parent, monitors have come along way. We have not used another video monitor, but overall we are happy this one. The ability to hear a noise and take a quick look before opening the door and potentially disturbing a sleeping baby, is just fabulous. The picture is not always great, but it does the job. I like being able to move the camera in almost every direction. The mobility of the handheld receiver is awesome as we take it out to the garage."
5,This item is a lifesaver,"I love this monitor! I don't know what I would do without it. It alows me to look at baby at her every coo or cry without disturbing her to see if she relly needs me. My only complaint is that I have to switch channels from A to B to be able to see OR hear my baby. For some reason you can't do both at the same time. We sometimes use a cheap monitor to hear and leave the video up on this one or we just leave the sound on and when we hear her, we switch to the video to see what she is up to. I don't think I would have moved our daughter in her own room as soon as we did if we did not have this...especially since she is a reflux sufferer!"
5,"Great Product, Great Company!","Monitor is amazing, allows you to clearly see and hear baby day or night. I encountered minor static feedback but image was overall clear throughout my 2000 sq foot residence and even in the yard! After less than a year of owning it, monitor melted..I came back home to find the screen had actually melted! Contacted costumer service and they were extremely courteous and mailed me a fed ex label to send the monitor back. I sent the defective monitor back and less than 3 days later, a brand new monitor was at my front door. Now that is what I call excellent costumer service! Its good to know that there still are companies that stand behind a product 100%! I am so impressed with the monitor itself and the excellent service, I will without a doubt invest in other products in the future."
3,not that good image quality...,"Great device, great look, but quality image is not that good. The center image on parent unit is brighter than the corners, which may difficult details visibility. Sound part works fine, leds vu bar graph is nice. Range area worked fine for me (an area about 300 feet)."
4,Love the video,"Bought this item last week - the video is good - our son is 3 and doesn't always stay in bed. It's great to see that he's in there and asleep (or not). I bought it for the video, not the sound. I still use my sound monitor in conjunction with the video, and the sound monitor gives much better quality sound that the video monitor, but I knew that when I bought it (based on other reviews), so I'm not disappointed at all. We also have three cordless phones (900 mhz and 2 digital), and wireless airport in the house, and we don't have any problem with interference."
4,"Excellent monitor, great portability, price is the flaw","I now own this monitor, and I love it to pieces. It works as good as the non portable ones, which I also own one of. This is small, moves around the house with you, great picture and sound. Only downfall it the initial price you have to pay. The color picture is really unecessary, because the resolution of the black and white is so good anyway. also, it's black and white at night anyway. The overall cost could be dropped by just making this black and white. If you want to invest in this, you will not be disappointed, the benifits of portability are great, but the wired summer one's for night is great for basic night needs."
5,Completely Put My Sister At Ease!,I got this for my sister and her new born boy. Like any new mother she was afraid to leave the baby alone for even a minute. For her to be able to leave the room and go to the bathroom or get something to drink or get the mail and still keep watch on the baby - that is such a mental relief. For her and her husband.The picture is very good quality. She has had no problems with interference from other devices on the same frequency in the area.
5,So reliable we bought two....,"We have found this monitor to be very reliable. Just plugged it in and it works. I can't believe how well it works in low light/no light situations.We have a vacation home, and bought a second one so we don't have to bring it back and forth.No complaints."
3,Only works for 1 year,"Let me first say, when this monitor works it is fantastic! That being said, I will have gone through two of them (in less than 2 years). At about 1 year, the volume control stopped working. It would only work at the loudest setting (not good when I am sleeping!). I contacted customer service and they were great. For $65 they sent me a brand new monitor and camera. Well now it has been less than one year and it is happened again! The volume only works on the loudest setting. I just contacted customer service again and am waiting for a reply. Very frustrating for such an expensive camera/monitor. Plus I purchased an additional camera for my other son's room."
4,Enjoying the video monitor,"This monitor has excellent sound quality for the audio portion. It also has good picture quality during the day, but appears more ""snowy"" at night. We have the camera mounted across the room from our daughter's bed, about 12 feet or so, so it may appear clearer if we move the camera closer (haven't tried it yet.) We live on a one acre property, so neighbors are close, but not close enough for any interference. We also have cordless and cell phones in the house with no issues. It works anywhere we need it to outside also and the camera handheld portion is light and easy to carry around. I would definitely recommend this product as it serves it's purpose well, just don't expect picture perfect quality. Regardless, we are entertained watching our 2 1/2 year old while she plays in bed, etc. We are thinking of adding an additonal camera for our baby on the way, but haven't tried it yet."
2,Fair product,"It advertises a ""color"" monitor, but it is NEVER in color - always black and white. Lots of feedback from other items in the househould. Not very pleased."
2,"Video good, audio bad","I researched video monitors to a great extent before purchasing. I asked friends, read reviews and talked to store associates. The Summer Infant Deluxe got the best reviews by everyone... despite a few poor reviews on Amazon.Once we got it home, we were disappointed with the audio. It cracks and pops frequently. The light bar across the front of the monitor bounces higher when there is a loud noise, such as your baby crying. Unfortunately, it also bounces high when the cracking noise gets loud. Therefore, unless you have the volume up, you may assume the bouncing light means your little one is crying. If you have the volume up, you won't be able to sleep because of all the noise cracking and popping.We keep the volume off, have covered up the light bar across the front, and only use the video screen. The video is nice, it is well lit at night and in the day.I don't have a better recommendation, do you?"
2,"Good, for a while...","Excellent monitor. Easy to mount, good picture for several hundred feet as long as there aren't too many obstructions. Starts to act up when you are using two monitors on different channels. We've had three monitors (2 babies in 2 years). We got the third because the volume control failed on the first. Then the other two did the same thing....You can't buy just a replacement receiver.Other models last longer."
5,Best Anime Ever !!!,this is one of the best animes i have ever seen. it hits on all levels and i would recommend it to anyone who likes anime and music. if your not sure if you want to buy the series you can check it out for free online at Stage6. there is also a CD of the series- also highly recommended.
5,sixguns review,Everything you heard about this book is true dont let the price stop you. It reads like it was written by a research team but is in fact all from one old cowboy. It pays for itself in that you'll never buy gun magazines again.
5,Powerful Soul Medicine,"Suffering breaks the heart open, an open heart leads to compassion, compassion leads to action to stop suffering. Joanna Macy gives us permission to feel the suffering of the planet and the practical tools to lead both ourselves and our planet back to creation. This work that re-connects is powerful medicine for the soul. It creates a world of hope and triumph not just for us, but for the generations to come.."
3,"Okay, but not quite what I was expecting.","As an artist looking for photo reference material for use in illustration, I was at first excited to come upon the ""Pose File"" books. I chose the ""Pose File #9 - Duets"" book, because I was looking for poses that reflected the everyday interaction between men and women. Unfortunately, what I got was hundreds of poses of two nude Japanese girls. Not that there is anything wrong with the material. The nudes are well done and whether or not they would be considered sexually provocative depends on your point of view. I didn't find them to be so, but all female poses was not what I was looking for and the term ""Duets"" leads one to assume that you are getting both sexes. So I just wanted to add this little warning to the propective buyer - If you are looking for photo reference material on both men and women, this is NOT the book for you. I suspect that this is also the case with the other books in these series, but I have no proof of that, so - buyer beware!"
2,Good Poses for models or instructor to consider but...,"Not good for the art student. Photos are small and as in this entire series some areas are blurred or photographic ""touched-up"" to conceal the true anatomy. So buyer beware! However, if you model or are an instructor or monitor and need a great resource for poses to consider, then this is a Five Star book."
1,skyhawk,this would be a great tape if it read in 1/8 or 1/4 inch instead of 10th of an inch. An accurate product description should tell you this.
1,Don't bother.,It was not worth watching even if it were free. It was just like sitting at a conference and not at all captivating or informational.
5,Willys Jeep rear spring,"This spring fit like a glove and the price was right! Thank you for such fast service, I received it in 2 days. I forgot to order a front bushing but used the one from the other spring. It was perfect for my 1949 Willys."
1,Disappointing re-recordings,"Only one track out of 21 is an original recording (Venus by Frankie Avalon) The rest are stereo re-recordings, made in many cases, years later. For those who remember the bite of the originals, most tracks are a disappointing facsimile."
4,Promising beginning,Midge Ure's first solo album (produced when Ultravox were on a break in the mid-80s) has enough difference from the Ultravox sound to ensure that the album is capable of standing on it's own.The Ultravox influence is there in many tracks most obviously in the hit tracks 'If I Was' and 'That Certain Smile' but there are other which hint at a new direction and style for Ure.The style change can be seen clearly in tracks such as 'She Cried' and the title song which are less fussy and more musically clearer than the Ultravox inspired music and also give Ure a better chance to use his quite exceptional vocal talents.Apart from two rather uninspiring instrumental tracks there is a lot to listen to here both musically and lyrically. While it may be a put off for some people this can definitely be classed as 'intelligent' music. Not to all tastes but definite a promising beginning for one of the 80s best artists.
2,Not Original Recordings,"Typical with most if not all of Madacy releases, these are all remakes and not original recordings. If you are expecting to hear these songs the way you heard them on the radio, then this cd is not for you."
3,Adrift on the Nile,"A sort of Eqyptian Bartelby the Scrivener meets Brian de Palma. The book portrays a group of overeducated and generally understimulated, underemployed professionals who meet nightly in a hookah ritual that seems to roll on like the everpresent Nile until the one night when an outing changes things forever. The book marvelously conveys modern aimlessness, ennui, and the haunting presence of the past. Short, but depressing."
3,Prize-winning?,"This is the third book that I've read by Mahfouz. I believe it will be the last. I started reading him because he is, after all, a Nobel Prize-winning author. I couldn't figure out why after reading ""Respected Sir"" or ""The Search"" and I'm still not sure after ""Adrift on the Nile"". However, this last book was the best of the three and you might want to read it and judge for yourself. It's short and won't take long to read. I found it surprizing to read about such a decadent group of individuals partaking of their illegal substances in the middle of Cairo. The basic plot, as I understood it, has to do with examining the reactions of artistic intelligentia with cold hard reality. How do people who search for ""Truth"" handle the truth? We'll at least he didn't drag it out. I'm not sure why Mahfouz won the Nobel Prize but I'm through trying to find out."
4,"Fan works great, just a lot louder than I had hoped","Fan slipped in just like the broken one. Works great, just load. I was hoping I could put a variable speed on it to quite it down alot, but didn't work. I am just deeling with the load noise."
1,Duh,"I can't believe that I read this book. I'm single again, after a five year relationship and felt out of ""game shape"". I thought that I needed to rethink strategies for meeting women(other than bar flys). But what I actually found out suprised me. This book is about absolutely nothing- exactly 2 hours of nothing. All it says is that in order to meet women, you'll have to approach woman- DUH! That's it- honestly!I actually feel ripped off for buying this book and am searching for my reciept and the Amazon.com return policy.Would you believe that I think that I'm actually dumber for reading this book! Guys...don't waste your money or two hours of your time believing that this will be entertaining reading (it's not)."
2,Not for the novice!,"I ordered this book for my baby brother. I enjoy cooking and often entertain. As an experienced cook I could prepare these dishes but even I am put off by anything that requires me to zest three lemons. I've found that my husband is much more daring in the kitchen and he admits some of the recipes would be fun. The book offers witty commentary and the ""dudes and don'ts"" of entertaining are terrific. If you are looking for wit and special meals for the weekend this book would be fine. For everyday survival, this is not what you want."
3,Dude Food: Rcipes for the Modern Guy,"Although this recipe book was very nicely laid out, I thought the recipes were a little too complicated and required more ingredients than the normal bachelor would keep in his cabinets. I bought this book for my 21 year old nephew and was hoping for some very basic recipes for a young man on a budget."
5,Amazing!,Beautiful on my toes. love it! They pop really well and make feet look pretty. OPI in general makes very nice colors and this is one of the best I have used
5,Hauntingly Real,"This book is a ""must have"". My personal tradition is a blend of outward and inward workings. This book is well and truly grounded in inner workings. Timothy Roderick balances and blends his experience in psychology with his wisdom of Wicca. It's one of the few books out there that understand the inner aspects of personal growth and our spirituality. My only regret about this book is that when I met Mr Roderick a few years ago, I didn't have my book with me to ask him to sign it :)"
3,"Very good, but the new-ageiness mars it a bit","This is very good book, and I particulary liked the narrative view of the Sage in some excerpts. Theres new terms in it,the rituals are typical Llewlyn fair(stupid). This is VERY influenced by Jung, reminds me more of a psychology book than a magic book."
3,So-so.,"It was okay. Not great, but okay. The fluffiness doesn't abound, but it's there. He does do a good job with the Jungian psychology, but he can do so much better. Janet and Stewart Farrar do a better job with the Jungian thing.I like how Tim stresses that one should not hold the light's hand and hide from the dark; the dark must be faced and explored.All in all, his work is better than that of Mr. Konstantinos *COUGH*FLUFFY*COUGH*, and the rituals... ugh! Must... breathe... fresh... air!At least the cover doesn't look cheesy."
5,No collection without Ian van Dahl...!,"Your trance-collection isn't complete without ""Castles In the Sky""! So select this totally cool cd now! It's worth it!T.Milan"
5,Excellent birding binoculars,"I already own a pair of these binoculars and are buying a second pair this Christmas. My family uses these for birding. We compared these side by side with a pair of Zeiss binoculars (costing $3000). These are only a hair less sharp and a lot less expensive. I bird with a lot of experienced people and everyone who has looked through these binoculars is amazed at how sharp they are and how much light they let in. I have recommended them to other birders and everyone who has purchased them is happy with them. I would highly recommend these to anyone. They are excellent in quality and durability. The ""realtree"" camouflage makes them extra cool!"
4,Great show,"The Deadliest Catch is a great series and the DVD's are almost just as they aired on TV, with the exception of the opening theme music, which overall is not that important. The only thing I wish there was more of on these DVD's is the ""After the Catch"" follow-up shows &/or more Behind the scenes foootage."
5,item is awesome deal is not,"amazon special deal huh, special way to rip you off, do the math they offer a 3 piece bundle for 80.99, episodes 1, 2, and 3, if you buy them individually their 11.99 each, so really 3 episodes are only 36 dollars, wow what a savings. 4o something more. I bought 1 through 5 for 60 dollars and some change. by the way very exciting show to watch, 10 plus"
4,From a Grandmother of ADHD Child,"This book was a quick, encouraging read! I purchased two extra copies to pass along to two young Mothers of ADHD children, and they both loved it. One passed it on to another. It is encouraging, and has already been a great help in understanding my unique little granddaughter."
4,ADHD doesn't mean disaster,"I purchased this book for more practical information in dealing with a child with ADHD. I found that the examples of children diagnosed with this specific problem did not give me practical ideas. The chapter on the use of medication, was probably the most insightful."
1,broadway,"As a vocal performer on broadway i find this book absolutely appauling.The notes are so distorted that it is basically a different song entirely than the composer intended. I have worked broadway since 1986 { untill i went to work for disney in 1989} and i must say this book is insulting to the musicals that they are loosely based upon. Please do not be offended as this is MY opinion of this music book and others may feel differentlysincerly,Jodi Benson"
3,Meh,"Deffinetly not the best broadway songs ever..............i got this book because I'm a musical fanatic and play both keyboard and guitar, but the music in here was really diffecult and the songs werent that great. When you have over 50 musical soundtracks in you collection and have seen even more done in production, but still dont know some of the songs or musicals in the book you can tell its out dated. I liked the Big Book of Broadway a lot better"
1,Be careful,3 times I have tried to buy the EASY PIANO version of this book and 3 times I was sent the paino-guitar-vocal version. I give up. I am done with Amazon.
3,Helpful...,"Book got here fast but had a fair amount of highlighting, which bugged me at first but whoever had the book before me highlighted some good info... not so bad after all."
2,A strongly accented Spanish Tony????? Think again.,"The music is okay... maybe missing some necessary drama... but Jose Carreras as Tony? A Polish kid played by a Spanish singer with a pronounced Spanish accent??No... talk about disastrous casting.Didn't anyone involved remember that this is an ethnic conflict with the Spanish on one side and the non-Spanish on the other? And to hear this strong Spanish accent coming from a founder of the Jets is... unsettling, to say the least...I'll go further; it ruined the experience for me, actually... I mean, Mr. Carreras is a fine singer but once he starts talking... please."
2,Super strong? my ass!,"these things will hold a piece of paper or MAYBE two, but they ARE NOT SUPER STRONG and probably wouldn't hold much more than that. pretty lame!"
5,GREAT DANCE MUSIC,This is the best TEchno-dance music!!! I strongly recommend allthe people who never heard of this band to listen to this music.. ITs absolutely incredible!!!
5,Cross Country Dolls,"I LOVE this book! I bought it at on online bookstore that specializes in books for RVers and I have used it to find doll collections all over the west coast. I never would have found the wonderfully eclectic collection at the Eastern Oregon Museum without it. I enjoy this book so much, I bought Witt's other book, Contemporary American Doll Artists and Their Dolls, and am now reading it."
1,"Not right for me, is it right for you?","My newest passion is going to doll shows. Oh, I love seeing all the different dolls and finding the bargains! BUT I'm in an area of the country where doll shows are months apart. I found this book and thought it would be great... Until I took it home and looked at it. It was AWFUL! No convention listings, doll club information was way too general and all the stores and museums are in the northeast, nowhere near me. I ended up returning the book THE SAME DAY! This was not the right book for me."
3,"Not great, not terrible","While this product certainly isn't great, I think the one other reviewer (so far) has overreacted. It isn't especially well built and in certain lighting conditions it can be difficult to see, plus the refresh rate is pretty slow. However, the product does work and I've used it with success in many situations. It's especially good for street photography where you don't want your subjects to react to the camera. If you are just looking down at your camera people have a much different reaction compared to if you are blatantly aiming right at them, so you get far more natural photographs, and less hostile subjects. Also the Zigview can be used as an enhanced angle finder when taking macro shots. It allows you to position the camera in tricky locations/orientations but still have a clear view of what you are photographing."
3,Confusing Ending,"I liked the sleuth, but I just plain thought the ending made no sense. While I don't mind not figuring it out until the sleuth does, I like it to make sense in retrospective. This did NOT. In addition, it was depressing because you feel so sorry for the little kid."
2,too high level,"I thought this book was a dry gloss of 2 subjects that deserve to be more interesting - history and opera. I thought the author did justice to neither by attempting to cover both too broadly. I had high hopes for finding more historical insight and perspective into the operas I love - but found more of a dry recitation of names, dates, titles, incidents. The people did not come alive for me. Am also reading a social history of early modern Germany called ""Flesh and Spirit"" - it's a much more interesting treatment of social history and, ironically, brings me much closer to the characters of operas written and/or set in that period."
2,bad customer service,When I got this watch there were no instructions on how to set the correct time. I called the manufacturer and they said they didn't have instructions on this watch and would have to go to their stock room to get those instructions and would call me back with info. They NEVER CALLED BACK! Thankfuly my daughter was able to figure it out
2,The End of the World,"Having just ordered this book, I discovered I missed the end of the world! After wading through the maze of information concerning surviving NBC, I am left with an image of hosing my family clean of chemicals while determining how not to recontact the air, consuming canned foods while wearing a gas mask, and hiding the family females from my marauding neighbors. Then I need to have my Bible to read, it's a good thing I happen to be Christian, so that I can contemplate why our God is punishing us!"
4,good,it's durable and does not break easily from the weight of the diapers. I like this product. it's also easy to wash.
3,a decent and wholly predictable show/book,"None of the decisions in this show were very difficult to make. All of the current stars in the drawing/painting world are present (John Currin, Kara Walker, Elizabeth Peyton, Kai Atoff, etc.) and the work they've offered is mediocre. That is not to say the work is bad by normal standards, they are the best of the contemporary scene for a reason: they're good. But, looking at each artist's best work, none of this is it. The essays are kind of hokey and embarrassing (in a bad way). The book is worth buying if you want to seem like you're ""with it"" when it comes to contemporary art, or if you are a student (such as myself, forever) and need it for research purposes to aid your own studio practice."
4,At the top,"Drawing Now does a good job of critically displaying the work of many contemporary artists. Unlike Vitamin D, this book does not take a shotgun approach to viewing contemporary art, and as a result is more satisfying to behold. Not all the artists represented have great work, but you get quality reproductions of it, and worthwhile commentary on each of the thematic ""propositions"" in the book. Worth buying if you have the money. Worth renewing your library's copy if you don't."
5,Super Radical,"This 1 gig memory stick is the fourth (4th) memory stick I've purchased, and I have to say, it is fantastic, and fast.I use the 1 gig in my Sony H1 camera (mostly for video at 30 frames per second), as well as my older Sony DSC-P52. I am totally amazed at how fast it processes, and how fast it formats. Formatting is instantaneous.I couldn't be happier with it, and I would strongly recommend this memory stick to the majority of shutterbugs. The 512 is just a bit too small, and the 2 gig is a little pricey, at least at this time.Martin"
1,VERY WRONG order,"I ordered a NEW Memory Stick Pro, which is the right size for my camera and was pictured in the listing. I DID NOT receive what I ordered, rather a REFURBISHED Memory Stick Pro DUO"
4,Good quality Memory Stick Pro,"Quality seems to be good, or at least as well as expected and price was reasonable. Super Saver shipping took much longer than expected (about 10 days more). Apart from that, very happy."
2,I was sent a substitute without consultation,"The item I was sent was not the exact item that I ordered. Although the substituted item would have worked in the camera, it did not suit my purpose as it was a gift for an elderly lady who cannot deal with extra problems like adaptors.I had to return it and order another item which still wasn't exactly what I wanted (another brand, not Sony) and was only 512 instead of 1 gb.I should have been informed first, instead of being sent the wrong item."
5,Fast Shipping,"I was surprised how fast the order came in. We had a bad storm the day before, but it was still on time."
3,MagicGate???,This is a great memory stick in almost every respect. Except for the fact that is doesn't function as a MagicGate secure music/file storage unit. I have 3 seperate MagicGate compatible audio players that all work fine with every other memory stick I own except this one. This isn't a problem for those people looking for unsecured storage though
1,very saaaad,"i have complain about that product , and i asked somone to answer me but no one respond.. so i rate that product zeroooooo. nahed arafa"
1,Wrong memory stick,"During check out of a sony digital camera, I was prompted to buy this stick. Assuming that this stick matched my camera, I accepted. Guess what-It did not match my camera. Now the return is still not being completed as was promised(a box was supposed to arrive within a week). Be careful"
5,Worked great with no problems,I bought this to put in my digital picture frame so I could store more photos. This worked great with no problems at all.
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE GUYS-READ & HEED,"My original order was placed before Christmas for 1G of New Memory Pro. memory for my camera at around $40.I received REFURBISHED (it said so on the packet) Memory Pro Duo which is of no use to me. The cost of this item was at least half the price of what I originaly ordered and was charged to my card. BuyAccessories still charged my card for the more expensive memory that I originally ordered.Buyer beware!!!, this company has no contact phone number. All communication is by email only and it is hard to get a response.The reponses one does get are highly unprofessional. It is a shame Amazon associates with these cowboys!!! If it were possible to get a negative star awarded, BuyAccessories would certainly receive it.On a more positive note I would highly recommend the company: OEM PC WORLD. This company had the exact memory that I needed, service was fast, polite and professional."
1,Wrong item received,"What arrived was a 256mb memory stick duo, had to return it and still awaiting right item"
1,Not the right memory stick,"Amazon sold me this, pairing it with the Sony camera I bought at the same time. It was the wrong kind, I needed a Memory Stick Pro Duo! So I had to return it and it cost me about $5 to return it, with the postage and all. I was very disappointed in Amazon, they have given me good service since I started using them in 1999."
1,Wrong one,"I'm so angry... I have a Sony DCR-HC90 camera, and on amazon, it suggested I buy this memory stick. So I bought it, opened it, and found it that it's the wrong one. My camera only takes duo size memory stick. Now, I will admit my ignorance between standard size and duo, but I'm really upset that it would suggest I buy this memory.You'd think it would know what was compatible with the camera and not. grrrr"
1,Not Compatible with Sony Cybershot DSC-W50,"I give it 1 star, but I never used it. Had to return it to get the Pro Duo Memory Stick, to be compatible with the camera I bought."
4,Better for a small cat,"The Kitty Hutch is a little bit smaller than I had anticipated. Our cat did not use it at all - even after putting cat treats and nip inside it. He is a 10-11 pound cat and there was just not enough room. Then we decided to remove the cushion which creates a lot more room and he seems to really enjoy it (of course we had to entice him with the treats and nip). I am sure it does not keep him as warm as if the cushion were in it, but at least he uses it now.Also I should note that the cushion is blue on one side (pictured) and cream on the other and is machine washable."
4,Nice necklace,"I like this necklace. I wanted something SS that dropped down and this fits the bill. The charm is pretty, not stunning, but I am happy since it doesn't look as fancy as it could with the CZ in it. Overall, pleased."
2,No solutions provided to exercises,"I think it stinks that there are exercises provided, but no solutions (unless you want to pay for them!)"
2,not a very helpful reference,this book has been pretty useless as a reference book. The author covers too many topics but doesn't stay focused on one topic. He mentions available features of Java but does not provide very good examples on a particular subject. I had a much easier time finding good examples and explanations in the Exploring Java and Core Java books.
1,Proof again that Programmers can't communicate,"This book is aimless, haphazard, badly organized, confusing, and does not do a good job in introducing core concepts in Java. It's one thing to know something about a subject...it's entirely another matter to be able to effectively teach it to someone. Long-winded, boring, misleading, no output to illustrate code examples, diffuse, BAD. I don't understand how this book got so many 4 and 5 star ratings. Maybe the average Programmer reading this book is immune to incoherent writing styles."
3,Just as third book,"This title was one of recommended for my Java studies and i found a lot of positive response on the net. I am finishing my course very soon and realizing that it was wrong choice, not my style, i found organinization of chapters sometimes disapponting and unconvinient. This book have not been used for studies but Flanagan and Horton, online tutorials. Three stars for inner classes, new AWT model and design patterns."
1,Someone Should've Splurged for an Editor,"Aaargh!! Maybe it's because I'm coming into programming via a journalism background, but I can't make heads or tails of most of what Eckel is saying. For Christ sake man, didn't you get anyone who was NOT a programmer to try and read and understand this book. I don't advocate the ""For Dummies"" oversimplification of things, but please, work with me a little. I'm selling this one and trading it for one in the Wrox series."
2,Good book but lacking solutions to exercises,"I downloaded the TIJ book and started reading the first two chapters. Initially, I thought this was an excellent book. Bruce Eckel says that the solutions to the exercises are available online for a small fee. I was planning to purchase the solutions but when I went to his site, he says that he has the solutions for chapters 2 and 3 only and that he does not know when he can complete the solutions for the remaining chapters. Right there and then, I stopped reading the book. He misled the readers of his book. I was supposed to give him 5 stars for his good writing style but decided to give his book a net rating of 2 for lacking solutions to exercises."
5,Excellent Primer,"I highly recommend this book to anyone learning the Java language. Bruce has a writing style that makes it easy to understand the points he is making. It is much better then Beginning Java 2 by Horton, Eckel has good examples unlike Horton who likes to get caught up in mathematical concepts instead of programming concepts. I will definitely be going back to this book to use as a reference."
4,seems to be a great book,clear basic concepts to advanced concepts.. i would recommend it to beginners..
2,I can't agree that it is a good book,"After I bought this book I feel that this book is so unorganized,the only good part is network programming chapter. If you don't want to waste your money, don't buy this book, try the Java 2 complete or some other book better than this one."
1,It assumes you Know C++,"why repeat myself? It assumes you know C++, save yourself some money be reading some it online. It did not work for me, another door stop"
5,It could be best,Sir I had not purchased the book.I am a student with out earning.So I continue my studies at home.If you have a sample book for helping purpose give me some % off on it. I am very thankful to you.
1,If you believe all that hype....,This book is the worst written book on any programming language that I have ever read. The examples are totally useless and have no relevance to any real world applications. There are plenty of great Java books out there. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one.
2,A decent book but not appropriate for beginners,While Eckel is certainly an expert in the realm of Java programming this book is certainly not appropriate for beginners to the Java language. I happen to agree with another reviewer that commented that the book requires a BS in Computer Science in order to read it. I teach Java at the college level and found the book to be too complex and tied up with too many details for anyone who wants to be a true student of beginning Java programming. The book is nice overall but at times difficult to read and follow.
3,Overrated,"The more I read, the lower my opinion became. The writing is neither clear nor concise. The compensation is a wealth of didactic programming examples. Unfortunately, the sample code is poorly formatted and arranged; important lines are overwhelmed by routine code (which was added so the reader could run the program); and lines not explained in the text require a separate reference (eg Sun's online API documentation). The book addresses itself to valuable material, but hasn't some other author done it better?"
3,Not for The Example Oriented,"I like to learn by example, in other words be presented with a situation and then code it. The THINKING IN JAVA book provided none of this. It goes into the concepts, but does not apply them. For people that need to visually see what code is intended to do, I would not recomend this. This book is for more experienced OO programers that are looking for specific code and not the entry level programmer who wants clear, concise example. All and all a decent reference, but not a great learning tool."
3,"Some good chapters, some terrible","I consider myself an intermediate-advanced OO programmer, I am fairly experienced with C++ and Python and decided to learn Java from this book, but there were some chapters in this book that made me want to hurl. In particular the chapter on inner classes made me think this Eckel guy just doesn't have a clue how to write. It was mindless example after example of the syntax of inner classes with no real examples of how they would be used in real world programming.... I almost put the book down on the weakness of that chapter alone."
2,good content; poor presentation; free on web...,"This book had pretty good content, but it is essentially just a bound printout of the book which is available for free on the author's website.Don't waste your money."
1,Could be better.,"I don't want to repeat all the criticism that this book already received. Just few points:1. The CD-ROM attached to the book has nothing to do with the book itself (the title of the CD is ""Thinking in C: Foundations for Java & C++""). I would like to have something more useful. I did'n buy this book to learn C language.2. Eight pages of reader comments with all this ""brilliant"", ""the best computer book"", ""excellent"", is too much. These pages could be better used.3. When you buy the book online you don't know that you have to pay extra for the solutions to the exercises. The solutions are sold on Bruce's site. Not bad way to make extra bucks for the author, but it's bad for the readers who have to pay extra money.4. The author dives into the depths of the language but forgets to explain the elementary things. The assumption is that the reader already knows C++ should be discaimed. I haven't seen many books that are so poorly organized."
4,Great Start for OOP,"If you have some procedural programming experience already then this book will be great for you to switch to the world of OOP. If not, then take it slow, but it can still work. I took an OOP course featuring C++ and got lost quickly, but in just a few chapters of Bruce Eckels' book, he helped me to understand what I had missed. The book starts out with a great foundation of explaining what objects are, then tells us that Everything is and object, and explains why. It explained these concepts in simple terms. The book then pays a little respect to program flow. For those who already have had programming experience, this is a quick read. Then it is back to the OOP ideas and then on into some more advanced Java topics. Excellent grouping and interesting section titles keep it a relatively light read. It covers the Java language, not just applets. That was refreshing."
4,Great but not muscular throughout,"This is overrated by some reviewers.First of all, this book will suit a C++ programmer most. The writer expects the reader to have some programming experience, so you need some programming experience to read and comprehend the book. If you are a C++ programmer trying to get a taste of Java, this book must be in your shelf. Most chapters of the book are excellent, but some are very dull.The book covers the basics of the language very very well. Whenever I had some query about the basics, I opened the book, and on almost every occasion,I found the answer.The chapters on GUI are dull, those should have had figures so the reader could get the picture of what the GUI would be like for the respective code. The book should have had more figures.... This books is based on Java 2 version 1.3 RC 1. A new edition, third edition, of the book is about to hit the shelves."
3,"Content very good, organization not so good","The book is chock full of really useful information, but I had a few problems with the book:1. It should be called ""Moving from C/C++ to Java"". If you don't know C/C++, you will find the many references to them annoying.2. This is not a book for beginning programmers. In the introduction the author does say that this book is intended for a reader who has some programming familiarity.3. I found some of the organization confusing. For example, I think the last 1/3 of the ""Introduction to Objects"" chapter (Internet, client/server programming, etc.)should be in another section. These topics don't really have anything to do with objects."
5,Perfect book for anyone interested in jumping into Java,"I felt obligated to thank you for you countless writing, specifically ""Thinking in Java, Second Edition"". Amazingly comprehensive book for newbies to coding and those who have experience but have never touched Java before. I myself have been poking around the programming and web development field (C, C++, Php and the such, but I'm only 16, your experience in these obviously dwarfs mine lol) and I find this to be one of the best books I have ever read. It's allowed me to pole vault over classes in a mere two weeks that would have taken my school a year-long course to cover.Thank you again for you generous free web-published version of ""Thinking in Java""."
3,Doesn't have the magic,"Some books have a magical ability to grab your attention and convey the information right to that part of your brain that really ""gets it.""This is not one of those books.Still, it's a good reliable reference source for serious Java coders. Use this after you ""get it"" some other way."
2,Keep shopping,"It's difficult to learn Java using only this book, as he doesn't get to the necessary depth, and he constantly mentions a Java feature and says, ""but we'll learn more about that later.""There are better books out there!"
4,It's worth buying,"I bought this CD for the Slash piece that is included. I liked each and every piece in this CD, and the only reason it gets 4 stars rather than 5 is because all pieces are quite similar. There are no significant variations in the mood or sound between them, so it can get a tiny bit boring by the time you reach the end of it. Great for background music."
2,Not the best choice on the market,"One hundred and fifty may seem like a lot of restaurants, but I was surprised at how many good restaurants were missing. Of course, a lot of good restaurants have opened since the publishing date in 1999, but I was surprised that some very established restaurants near my home in Winter Park were not included. Since the book seems to like every restaurant it reviews, perhaps only those restaurants considered good were included. ""No-holds-barred"" is not how I would describe it. The book also seems to have, for better or worse, a lot of Asian restaurants in it. Instead, I would recommend the Zagat's for Central Florida, which includes far more restaurants in the Orlando area, along with both the Atlantic and Gulf beaches. It covers more low-budget alternatives and it also includes far more warning rather than praise type reviews."
5,One of the best movies of the late eighty's,"I love this movie. Robert DeNiro, Charles Grodin, and John Ashton shine as hardluck partners. One of the most underated movies of the decade. Along the lines of Beverly Hills Cop and Lethal Weapon, this movie is about bounty hunters trying to pick up a ransom on an informant. I won't spoil it, just watch and you will love it"
4,A Good Laugh,Here is a great movie for anytime you need a pick-me-up. Good laughs throughout. Highly recommended.
3,great movie; terrible DVD audio transfer,"I'm very disappointed in the audio quality of this DVD; there's terrible distortion in most of the loud passages (e.g. every Joe Pantoliano scene), even when played at low volume, verified on a second dolby digital A/V system."
1,Caution,I bought this item not paying enough attention to the note that this DVD can only be played on a HD DVD player - and I don't have one. Now I have a movie - but I can't watch it!
3,Average Run,"Based on the reviews on amazon.com I ordered this dvd and quite frankly was disappointed with the movie. The action was nothing more than average compared to other flicks of this genre. In fact, the scene at the bus stop with the hit men (snipers) getting ready to take out the character played by Grondin was so unbelievable it was ridiculous (but not comical). Which leads me to the other issue I had with this movie. The comedy fell relatively flat as well. A mediocre mark for a mediocre film...3 stars."
5,Great flick and killer guitarist on the Elfman soundtrack,"I was watching this movie recently and I really took notice of the tasty R&B ensemble that makes up the Danny Elfman soundtrack. The guitar work is so nice I did a search to find who it is. I'm happy to report that the electric guitarist is the late Blues guitar virtuoso, Stevie Ray Vaughn. Who knew? SRV fans should give another listen to this fine soundtrack. Great road flick with real world dialog."
5,This movie cracks my top5 all time favorite movie list!,"I have seen this movie from beginning to end about 30 times. I have to see it atleast every 2 or 3 months. This is easily my favorite performance of Deniro! He is awesome as is Charles Grodin. A ""Can't Miss"" but be sure to watch the movie version and not the edited version for television. You'll love it and watch it for the rest of your life!"
1,phrimmtime review,I can not play this video and want to return it two others like this wont play . how do I get my money back or trade for movies that play. I have a brand new dvr / dvd player. Rating is poor / worst possible
4,A quirky character study,"If I have to rate this movie, I'd give it ****1/2 stars. It's close to a ***** movie, but I'm not generous with that rating. It's enjoyable, funny, and totally watchable. Plus it has Joe Pantoliano (who's the man - loved his character in THE FUGITIVE). Besides that, there's the obvious casting of Robert De Niro (never a mistake)."
3,De Niro Elevates a Potentially Generic Premise,"Just a few years removed from his most grizzled, death-rattle-serious work, Robert De Niro decides to go after some lighter fare for a change of pace and realizes it's not a bad fit. As an ex-cop bounty hunter with good intentions, De Niro takes a potentially flavorless role and shapes it into something deeper, adding personality and character where it's clear none was hinted in the script. Director Martin Brest deserves credit for allowing his cast the chance to ad-lib, as the film enjoys a much more honest, believable central relationship as a result. While the plot bears more than a passing resemblance to ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" it's more straight-laced than that and never completely steps across the line into full-on comedy, though it does test those boundaries once or twice. An overachieving, tenuous buddy film in the same vein as ""48 HRS"", it maintains a quick pace on a winding path without throwing its passengers."
3,Not a great transfer to HD DVD,"I was looking forward to replacing my DVD of Midnight Run because of the ""matted"" format used on the DVD. Needless to say, the HD DVD is presented in the 1080p/24 standard, and the quality easily exceeds that of the DVD.However, compared to other titles, Midnight Run is hardly a great measure of HD DVD. I admit, the quality issue could be due to the degradation of film until it was digitized. I have seen a limited number of other titles taken from film that are 20 years old, but it seems the studio could have done a better job, even with old film.This movie was not about the fine cinematography, so I have gotten past the issue. My rating is for the poor transfer to HD DVD, not the movie itself. Just understand you will not enjoy the finer points of HD DVD with this purchase...the movie, of course, is as funny as ever.5 stars for the movie3 stars for the HD DVD transfer"
3,Global view on sustainability,"Do not expect from this book practical guidelines to become ""sustainable"" as some reviewers seemed to have expected. This book explains in detail what sustainability involves, three majors fields: economical, social and environmental that the author called the triple bottom line. Each field has been for long separated from each other and the new trend for sustainability is to make them working together. How? There are no answers in this book. This book does not want to offer solutions but just to show us that this so-called revolution has already started, based on existing facts and where these changes are taking places."
5,a guide to get from here to there,"Elkington has created an awesome nuts and bolts description of where we have been, where we are, and where we are going. If The Ecology of Commerce (Paul Hawken) lays the visionary groundwork, this book is the next step. It adds in a lot of detail, bringing to light many cases and ideas about specific problems. It is a slow read but well worth the time."
1,Low on content and little practical guidance,"This book is bogged down in useless metaphores and imprecise, whooly language - well suited neither for practical decision-makers nor serious academics. Claims are not explained sufficiently well, and we are left guessing how to solve - or even understand - the important problems that this book claims to adress."
5,A real funky jazz classic!,"This album is hittin' neck and neck with the ""Headhunters"". I just love the song ""Butterfly"" off of this classic recording. Herbie layed it down once again. This cd is for any real jazz lover to have in their archives."
5,grooves that don't quit,"Groove-meisters everywhere are celebrating this long-awaited reissue. ""Thrust"" continues in the 70's fusion/funk vein of ""Headhunters,"" yet in a somewhat different style. Instead of phat, head-bobbin' grooves like ""Chameleon"" and ""Watermelon Man,"" this album features more rambling, frentic, sixteenth-note jams. Much of the difference lies in the switch to ""never-play-one-note-where-ten-will-do"" Mike Clark on drums. He and his bass counterpart Paul Jackson Jr. put on an absolute sixteenth-note-groove clinic. ""Palm Grease"" is a full-helping of mid-tempo James-Brown funk. ""Actual Proof"" and ""Spank-a-Lee"" are breathtaking rapid-fire burners, the latter recalling Tower of Power in its most inspired moments. None of the numbers feature much in the way of song development, but if you're a true believer in the power of the groove, you must add this to your collection."
4,Turn Up the Funk,"I don't like this album as much as the previous release HEAD HUNTERS, but admittedly that's a bit like saying I don't like the Mercedes as much as the Ferrari. Herbie Hancock turns up the funk (and turns down the jazz slightly) on this album, and comes up with four tasty slabs of funk fusion. The ensemble playing is excellent, and the tunes mostly catchy. Only a few things annoy me - one, you can hear songs turning towards ""Chameleon"" once or twice (but thankfully they back off before they get TOO much like it), and the top keyboard lines don't seem as memorable or as catchy. My favorite track is the mellow ""Butterfly"", but none of them are bad by any stretch. This album won't disappoint fans of HEAD HUNTERS, or of funk."
5,still funky,this man is badd!!!!!! this album is funky and the vibe is smooth.while herbie does a variety of different styles when he grooves he can hang with anybody.the man knows his stuff.and the musicians he has are top of the game.
3,Legacy 180g vinyl is not bad,"No odd issues with off center pressing or label, and it seems to be quality vinyl. Why only 3 stars is simply because the playback quality on Side 1 versus Side 2 was night and day: Side 1 sounds punchy, full and had me movin'. Side 2 sounds flat, distant and cold. To be fair, I have an original pressing of Man-Child that sounds pretty flat, but still has better dynamics than this Side 2 pressing of Thrust. Get this pressing of Thrust if you cannot get a clean copy of the original, as it doesn't really benefit from being 180g anyway."
1,Not the real artists!,"The price of $5.97 is an indicator on what to expect out of this CD. These aren't the original artists. So if you want ""Glory of love"" sung by Peter Cetera and so forth, then don't purchase this CD. If you're OK with someone else singing these songs, then this will probably be alright with you!"
5,cool boxset with a new show on it.,This set has alive 1-3 on it and a new show from 2000 on it. The alive 3 here also has the japanese bonus track on it too. It's remastered and prime kiss rockin' fun.Some might complain that they just wanted the newer show and already had the other discs but you can always sell those off and keep this boxset instead. The best buy set did not have the songs on it but I went back and they gave me a replacement disc that year. Of course thesedays you don't have to worry about that anymore.
1,SEE THE DIFFERENCE??,"PEARL JAM, a band that I love, plays a different setlist every night, and 48 hours later the show, great, unedited and pure, is available for download for $9.99.KISS, the band of my life, plays pretty much the same show over and over, and 7 years later (""Alive Millenium"") the edited show is available...but you have to buy a box containing albums that, as a fan & collector, you have ten times each...And the cd (""Alive IV"") is not even that good!See the difference? I rest my casePS: Of course, in terms of music quality, the box deserves more than just one star, but the whole gimmick of having to buy an entire box for one single cd is a rip-off.Signed: A KISS collector for 25 years"
1,Same old stuff!,"I like classic Kiss.But there comes a point in time where i'm done of hearing the same songs over and over.It's like hearing the last 3 minutes of Rock and Roll all nite!""I wanna rock and roll all nite,party everyday 50 times.Instead of making KISS toilet paper and KISS coffins lets get a new album out!You have a way better guitar player then ace now and a way better drummer than Peter,whats the problem?Let me guess a greatest hits package due out in 3 months?"
1,GENE AND PAUL STILL RIPPING OFF FANS,"Don't be fooled. Another reviewer said they had nothing to do with this release. That just ain't so. If you look on the copyright of KISS CD's you will see a P and a name followed by a C with a name and date. The P is the Producer of the work (record label) the ""c"" is the copyright owner of the work, the people that own the master recording. In KISS' case, they own all of the masters. The label cannot do anything without KISS' permission.This is just Gene & Paul repakaging the same old stuff and parting their fans from their money. If you want it, more power to you. Me, I'm happy with the copies of ALIVE! ALIVEII, and ALIVE III, I already own."
1,KISS SUCKS AND SO DOES DISCO,"In my opinion if you're a hard rock/metal band and you do disco,even once you my friend suck and are a total sellout.That's why I don't like KISS."
4,Great classics,This is what we've been waiting for so long. All hits in a great package and Alive 4 at least. There's no better live band around the world!
3,NOT The extended versions,"I has hoping Alive I-II-III would be released with bonus tracks not previously included, BUT they are the same old versions with slightly better sound. What a letdown. Where is Room Service, Two Timer, Let Me Know, 2000 Man, Hooligan, Flaming Youth etc...????? Why still keep the studio tracks on Alive II ?? Save your money."
3,Best Buyer Beware!!,"Although Kiss Online and Best Buy advertise exclusive bonus songs, ""2000 Man"" & ""God Of Thunder"" from the Millenium Concert, these songs are NOT included in the BB set. The copy I purchased even had it printed on a sticker on the plastic wrapping...""Featuring two previously unreleased bonus songs..."". I repeat, these songs can be found nowhere on the BB set. I called 4 different Best Buy's in my area and was told it was...""not their problem"". They were completely disinterested in helping me. If this is a case of false advertising I am sure I am not the only buyer who will be upset over this. That said, the Millenium Concert is a must have for the Kiss completist. 3 stars for the quality of the remastered versions and for the inclusion of the MC. I just wish it had come with the 2 bounus tracks as advertised!"
2,unexpectedly ratty,The description didn't prepare me for how old and wrecked this little paperback would be. It was definitely not gift quality.
4,Great (though short) album,"Well, in my opinion this is one of the best ""christian"" CD'S (although I don't know if something like this exists) I bought last year. The music has in places some similarities to bands like Oasis or Blur but I wouldn' call it a copy of that bands. There is plenty of musical identity of its own and you can't blame them for listening to the Beatles. Also the lyrics (though you have to think about them and have to come to your own interpretation sometimes) are refreshing because they don't follow the formula of how a ""christian"" song has to be. ""I'm in love with Jesus Christ but I'm not selling Him"" says it all. Maybe this could be a reason to think about and question the ""christian"" music industry. Though the album is a bit short it is still worthy because every song is really good. I recommed this album to everyone who is looking for great music. If you are looking for certain lyrics it might not be your cup of tea."
2,An experiment gone awry,"I bought this CD as a test, just to see what it would be like. It is supposedly Christian CD, but, reading the lyrics, I didn't see very many even remote references to Christ, God, or Christian themes. Also, the music was mediocre and lyrics were repetitive. Unless you like to be disappointed, steer clear of this album. It's not worth your while. I give it two stars because 1 star just has to really be terrible."
3,There are better 4 Seasons out there!,"I really love Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman, but I think they were both having an ""off"" day here--this isn't a particularly good Four Seasons. Much better, and far more inspired recording of the Four Seasons is the Trevor Pinnock/Simon Standage recording on Archiv records. Get that one!"
4,Interesting view of the OTHER side of the fateful day,"A longish film, and a touch ""stagey"" at some points, but good handling (in an almost docu-drama way) of the looooooooooooooooong day leading up to the Emperor telling Japan ""we're done"".While I'm familiar in only the broadest of strokes about Japan's wartime history, I never knew how close a (what amounted to) coup d'etat came to succeeding.A good addition to my growing list of military and war flicks."
2,Watch the Movie Instead,"I bought this as it was written by Ann and Evan Maxwell (A.E. Maxwell, Elizabeth Lowell, Ann Maxwell, etc.).The movie, caught on T.V. with the ""R"" rated portions removed is much better."
2,Agenda science,"Sociologists are normally very meticulous about how they design and conduct surveys and interviews. I found the questions the author posed to be unclear and subject to criticism, or to alternative interpretation. The individual quotations from adults who experienced divorce as a child have a complex underpinning that deserves further analysis: I suspect that many of these respondents are synthesizing an experience, sort of ""making the best of a bad history."" In any case, I don't think this book does more than try to substantiate further the theory of good divorce by interpreting grown children's responses to the best advantage of that theory. Not convincing."
3,"It's a classic, but...","This collection of competition modules would rate 5 stars if it hadn't been produced during TSR's 80s heyday when they seemed to have no proofreaders working for them. This thing is riddled with typos, and the art is flat-out atrocious. Still, if you can slog through the mess, the meat of the adventures shines through. A great epic quest to defeat the slavelords is a facet in a larger mega-adventure which includes the Temple of Elemental Evil and Queen of the Spiders. If and when TSR cleans this up and reissues it, it'll get 5 stars."
5,"Welcome to the Caribbean, love!","Never before have I been so pleased with a movie soundtrack music book before. This is really great. The pieces are probably a little advanced for most people, but if you know the music, it's not hard to figure out. It has every theme you'd want to play. Very, very, good!"
5,Great gift idea!,This item made a great gift for our music lover. You can not go wrong with Pirate of the Caribbean!
5,Pirates of the Caribbean-Curse of the Black Pearl,I provided this book for my piano recital students.They enjoyed learning the songs and gave wonderful performances.The songs are intermediate level and fun to learn.
2,very mixed,"This recording is typical of the thrown together casts which got classical record companies into trouble. The vagaries of style and diction between the Padre Guardiano and Leonora in their dialogue - for example - makes you wonder if they are indeed supposed to be singing the same language. Carreras copes heroically with his dimishing resources and Bruson handles his under-sized voice very capably. Sinopoli's conducting, hasty, ill tempered and poorly organized, is particularly sad when compared to Serafin, Marinuzzi or Schippers on other (more or less) complete recordings. Overall, Levine's RCA cast pulls together for the best Forza in stereo."
5,LOVE IT!,"SO I am currently on Accutane and my face broke out BAD last week when my cleanser ran out and I bought Biore... well it sucked, it was bad. SO I went and bought Loreal Acne Response and it is great!! Within 3 days all the ""new"" blemishes from that nasty cleanser went away! This stuff combined with my Accutane rocks!"
3,Good product,"I have had frequent acne since I was 13, now 20 I feel like I have tried just about everything. I found that the l'oreal kit was pretty good with the exception of the moisturizer, it leaves my skin very dry. I usually try to avoid benzol peroxide anyway because anything that dries your skin out that much will cause your skin to create more sebum leading to more pimples. Whether or not you can use benzol peroxide really depends on your skin type (consult your dermatologist). Basically, a good cleanser with salicylic acid, a toner with witch hazel or panthenol, and a light weight, (preferably something that doesn't dry the skin out) oil-free moisturizer will really improve acne prone skin. The l'oreal kit has two of the three. I now get a pimple every now and then but no breakouts."
4,I'm impressed!,"For a few years (I'm 43, Irish, German mix) I've been plagued with forehead and chin bumps and whiteheads. Sometimes even deep, nasty bumps. I picked up a trial size of Loreal daily (I've tried no-names which made me peel) and within a week, the acne was gone and my face is smoother. I am soooo jazzed. No peeling, but I only use it at bedtime. The lotion is really more of a mask. It does not work under make-up, it just comes up, like peeling paint. I don't use the lotion on my cheeks, just the problem areas. I've used it for two months now and no adverse reactions. I wash with the cleanser for one minute, and then rinse and use the two other products. For now, they have a loyal customer."
2,Emil Richards Yazz Per Favore,"I just listened to this cd,the sound quality is terrible, buy the vinyl lp and transfer it. Sound is tinny, hissy,had to turn the bass all the way down, its loud and not a good experience. The session itself was nice, but the cd sound quality stinks."
1,Book,"This was very disappointing for the price. I thought it was a book, not a play script..Next time I will review the contents to make sure it is what I think I am ordering.."
1,This is the play not the book,"Don't make the mistake I did, this is the play, not the book. If you want the book, you need the author Jean Merrill."
4,In the great continuum,"I've read almost all of Bogosian's work and really, this one smells the most personal of all. I've never seen him do his works(except movies...), but when you read it, you can almost see him ranting on. And this time, he's at is clearest. The magic lives on !!!Really, Bogosian gives meaning to the saying that tells us artists are the Guardians of Humanity.You can't escape it, the words he gives us speak of truth as you wouldn't want to know. He puts us in front of all you know but don't want to care about.If you hesitate, don't !!! Get it !!!"
4,Haynes Manual,I just replaced my front brakes guided by this manual. There were no surprises!The book told me exactly what to do.
3,Auto repare manual,"Paper was a little thin and the instruction had you jumping around a lot, from one chapter to the other. For the money not bad."
1,Poor printing and paper quality,The printing quality is very very poor. Also the paper quality is worst than a news paper (for a manual that will be used several times)I did not expect it to be so bad.It is also limited the topics (see cluch)
3,Good but flawed,The monitor works great. Beautiful except for a scratch on the screen. Was not in the description. It mentioned certain flaws and body scratches but not the screen. A little disappointed. Was able to remedy it with Vaseline trick.
2,not what I expected,The book was just not what I expected.It was informative though and loaded with black and white pictures. I thought there would be color photos in addition to the B&W. I couldn't make out enough details in some of the pictures.
5,Study with prayer,"This devotional is thought provoking and we'll written. It is in depth enough to give you things to meditate on without being overwhelming. There are themes that are carried over a few days, but it is not over done. Over all this an easy to use, well written daily resource."
4,As described,This DVD shows how Stan Zwiefel breaks down the opponents defense step-by-step. Would be very helpful to coaches with little experience in this area.
5,The Ultimate Manual for Dads,"Dads, if you can't understand your role after reading this book, you just can't do it! I've read many, many 'dad' books, but this is absolutely my favorite, because it's the best!"
4,A must for business process analysts,"The HOM software contains eight modules that are used by business analysts. These include: Aggregate Planning, Forecasting,Inventory Management, Materials Requirements Planning, Project Management, Process Analysis, Quality Control, and Waiting Line Analysis. The manual contains step-by-step instructions and case examples to illustrate the application of these techniques to real life problems.The software is being used to teach Operations Management in several schools and in several countries. Business analysts will find the forecasting, project management, inventory management, and process analysis modules especially useful to quickly create models and obtain results."
3,Not as good as the first series of stories (volume I) but not bad,"I started watching these to tide me over until David Suchet's Poirot returns for his final bows.I pretty much agree with another reviewer here that the stories move a little too fast sometimes, and you find yourself wondering how Father Brown figured things out. A couple of the stories are not very good, but there is one very clever one set in a London theater house that I enjoyed.I also think that anyone who complains about production values ought to remember that these were shot in the early 1970s and remember that any television show from that era will look much less polished and ""real"" than the stuff we get nowadays.Bottom line: I probably will buy the next volume of Father Brown stories if there are any more. But I think I will try to get the next set used."
2,Disappointed Again,Father Brown Stories: 2 Volume Set (Folio Society)Once again I have been fooled into buying a DVD without subtitles. Amazon needs to state whether or NOT subtitles are available.
2,Kenneth More doesn't get it right,"It's amazing why no one has said that the emperor has no clothes! Father Brown in the stories is a humble, compassionate man, saddened by the flaws in human nature that force us to commit crimes. Kenneth More plays him as a sarcastic, dismissive character who is hardly ever polite or warm to people. Very 'un-priestly' and certainly not the mild-mannered Father of the Chesterton stories."
2,I expect better from Interweave,Simple is definitely the word to describe this book. The photography is gorgeous and the pictures take up most of the space. The projects are contrived and poorly explained for beginners. A mix of retro hippie/today's young hip designs. There isn't one project that interests me nor is there any inspiration to be taken from these designs. I expect better books from Interweave Press. This one is a disappointment.
3,Color on Color,"Sorry to say, my copy was missing over 20 pages. Too bad, since it was beautifully written and illustrated. If I had paid full price, I would have returned it. Can still use it for the projects I liked."
1,Hawaiian music from Canada,"If you love Hawaiian music, then you'll hate this CD. Please don't buy this CD if you in any way shape or form like Hawaiian music. When you open up the CD jewel case, you will see that it's made in Canada, not in Hawaii or by Hawaiians. I gave the CD the benefit of the doubt and gave it a spin. After listening to this abomination on my ears, I felt as if I was trapped in a bad restaurant with a Hawaiian theme and this CD was playing in the PA speakers."
1,huh?,I got this thinking that I would hear songs that I know. You would enjoy this music if you were born before 1940. Senior Snooze. Didn't expect Hawaiian Organ Music.
4,Great Intro to Music for Your Mind's Movie,"I took a chance on this having never heard anything by Arkenstone, and now I want more. I'm not the standard listener to New Age, though I was collecting Berber folk music albums and 'Tibetan Bells' back in the LP days. Still, I've always enjoyed instrumental soundtrack music for background when I write fiction, and these fill the bill without attaching any images except the ones in my head. Some cuts like ""Explorers"" are very symphonic, some like ""From the Forge to the Field"" or ""The Palace"" are distinctly jazzy. Take a chance on this: it's good stuff."
1,Blackberry smells like cucumber,Ordered Clearly Natural Blackberry glycerine soap at a good price. Got ten bars of cucumber instead. Not worth the money or hassle to send it back. Doesn't lather very well or hold together very well and smells like a cucumber. Whoa.
2,"Sounds good, but poor handling.","I bought this album for my girlfriends birthday. The album shipped quickly and the price was alright. When I received the record I noticed the sleeve corners were crippled and slightly bent. I didn't mind too much at the time. However after I gave it to my girlfriend and she played it on her record player, we then noticed the album was extremely warped, causing the needle to move up and down considerably. Not too pleased."
4,The most thorough account of this particular event,"This is a straight-forward account of Michael Ryan and his Hungerford killing spree. It details the crime rather well and doesn't jump around too badly. It reads more like a long newspaper article rather than a pulse-pounding novel, but that's okay, I just wanted to learn about the crime. The only annoying parts are too many quotes from the pretentious mayor and the weakling local priest."
2,Don't buy unseen,"Don't buy this book unseen. I did and I regret it. It was certainly not the eye-opener I hoped it to be. I'm sorry, but I just don't find the examples very useful, the book offers solutions to problems which I personally have never encountered."
1,Bad choice to buy this book !,"The issues raised in this book are few, and they are well-known and they are not interesting. E.g. the stuff about Strings in Java, well everyone knows it after 0.2 hours of practice. No word whatsoever on J2EE subjects, internet/web stuff, nor anything else interesting. What is covered is only interesting for those who have no experience at all (on earth) or those who lived on Mars for the last 10 years. This book is not useful for either beginners or advanced Java users. It is a waste of time and money that you had better spend on a more informative and useful book."
5,Good Tips and Solutions,"I always enjoy reading these types of ""tips"" books. Generally speaking, this book offers good tips and solutions to Java's ""pitfalls"" by using well-written examples. And by reading this book I understand Java more and more. Without it, we could read and read more about the ""Java Programming Language"" book in order to understand throughout where the ""pitfalls"" are. So this book can save us a considerable time! Another similar book, ""Practical Java Programming Language Guide"" of Peter Haggar, also offers excellent tips and solutions. To some extends, both provide inside understanding of Java and some problems that Java programming may encounter. This book mentions a more variety of problems while ""Practical Java Programming Language Guide"" provides more deep explanations. Get both if you can afford! They are worth the money!"
1,Bark Free didn't work for me.,"All the dogs did was look up at it the first two times it went off and then went back to barking. After the second time, I was the only one that heard or paid attention to it and it was VERY annoying. I'd rather hear the dogs bark.Might work for someone else, didn't do anything for us. I returned it for a refund."
2,barkfree,I tried it on the audio to see if it worked and it worked infrequently when my dog barked in the house. The barking in the house was very loud. This would have no effect out in the yard on neighbors dogs so I used it from a window. It had little effect on their need to bark but they found it annoying and would go to the far side of the pen. Bark free was not sensitive to barking and did not work unless I pressed the button on audio. It certainly was not cheap. Thank God these horrible neighbors who had dogs penned about 60feet from my window are no longer there. In this county there are no enforced ordinances.
2,"Stops Barking, Sometimes","My dog has learned how to use this item faster than I. He stops barking occasionally but usually ignores it. I've tried adjusting but not effectively. Directions are minimal and of no real use. Item is nice looking and if more effective, would be great."
3,Balance Beam,I purchased this toy for lmy 3 year old who is develomentally delayed.It is well constructed and can bear my weight with is a lot more than recommended. It also breaks down for easy storage and the width can be changed to a more challenging size.It is a very good coordination tool for her. It is not a toy she plays with on her own so and will only do it if other kids do it before her.
3,It was just ok,"I am not sure that I think it a good product. First, the price is high for a 2 x 4 piece of maple. I bought it for a 4 and 6 year old and it was not steady as they tried to walk on it. $49 to $59 would have been a more fair price."
3,keep looking,These fit the purpose but I would recommend them to anyone and if I had used them before I wouldn't have bought them. They are not bery stable. They wobble when the kids walk on them and they are very slippery. I put a strip of duck tape down the middle so the kids wouldn't slip when they walked on them.
5,Very resourceful and appreciated gift.,"With more than 36 teachers, coaches, music directors, and Sunday school teachers who instruct or coach my children, it is often very difficult to go out and buy a specific gift for each of them during the school year and each holiday. This way, I can make them something to express our appreciation for their work and give them a homemade gift that will be thoughtful and deliciously appealing. Hence, I am grateful for Gifts in a Jar. The recipes in this book are for various soups and include gift tags to cut out and personalize. Presently, I am still trying each of these recipes on my own family before choosing. The authors give great suggestions for layering the ingredients as well as how to make the gift more attractive. Also, it is fun and easy to do with your children for their respective teachers."
5,gifts in a jar,"We will always buy this product it make for such a wonderful gift for every occasion, every one should own one of these"
3,"Some good recipes, few recipes in book","I have most of the books in this series. My parents are aging and I have been looking for items that I can make for them which will have a long shelf life and would require them to do minimal food preparation, yet still have a 'home cooked meal'. The recipes fit the bill for the most part. In each book I found that there were a few recipes that are great and some I wouldn't try at all. This is what I usually find in any cookbook. I would comment that each book only has about 25 or so recipes in it. The rest of the pages consist of 6 copies each of pre-made instruction cards to enclose with each food package. I did feel disappointed in the number of recipes for the cost of the book"
4,These books are everywhere now,I got this book with my Grandma in mind and I did use the recipes atChristmas to make her soup mixes that she could use and she loved it.For inexpensive or a little classy the ideas are overall good and youcan add your own special touches.
1,oklachef,I was very disappointed in this book. I made several of the recipes to give as Christmas presents and they were terrible. I was very disappointed and embarrased to give them as gifts. I had already purchased all the ingredients and the supplies and it cost me a great deal for a gift that was not edible. I would be very nervous to order anything else from this company.
2,This is not a root. Not as effective.,I purchased this product thinking it was a root. The Amazon description was not very clear. After I received the product I realized it was not made from the root. The roots are potent and work quite well.
5,"Book ""The Early Paper Money of America"" by Eric P. Newman","I have just started collecting early American currency, and I found this book absolutely essential. It is well-written, easy to find notes and the ""going rate"" for those notes. If you look around for a good buy on this book, you can get the most current edition (mine was edition 5)for around $30-40. Highly recommend, and I give it 5-stars!!!"
3,Delicate product,The product and service were excellent--EXCEPT that the delicate product arrived broken up with the tins dented in shipping.
2,Delicious but damaged goods,As with most of the reviews here my tins arrived with 75% or more of the wafers crushed. We ended up using a spoon to eat the crumbs of the 1st tin we opened. Outstandingly delicious but I cannot imagine serving these to guests as the chocolate had also melted and you cannot avoid getting chocolate on your fingers as you pick at the small remaining wafer tubes that are available. What a mess. If these had arrived whole they would get 5 stars instead of just 2.
5,Delicious but fragile,"My wife and I love this delicate wafer rolled round a delicous chocolate paste. The only problem we encountered is that it was poorly packed for shipping and as fragile as the product was, we had many soft globs of chocolate surrounded by wafer flakes. There was at least 75% breakage.We will try it again soon, but if it comes damaged, it will be return/refund time."
1,CROSS CONTAMINED WITH PEANUTS/NUTS OR EGGS,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT HAD AN ALLERGY ALLERT BUT IT FORGOT TO MENTIONED THAT IT IS MANUFACTURED IN SAME FACILITY WITH OTHER NUTS AND THAT IT MIGHT CONTAIN EGGS. WE HAVE A PERSON WITH PEANUT AND EGG ALLERGY AT HOME AND ENDED UP HAVING TO CALL RESCUE AFTER TWO BITES.OUT OF THE 6 CANS, WE ONLY OPENED 3 AND THEY WERE ALL MELTED OR BROKEN.TERRRIBLE."
5,Excellent Space Clearing Spray,The Space Clearing Spray is excellent. I was introduced to it by a student of mine a couple of years ago. I needed some cleansing so I looked it up. It arrived on time and in excellent condition. I recommend it without hesitation.
4,Great Adventure,"A very realistic ""adventure"" of life with an average American family. This adventure is sprinkled with the humor and pathos of a ""coming of middle-age"" mom/wife who is seeking self through a form of spiritualism and everyday living.One laughs with ""middle-aged"" Muriel's leap into the working world, gasps at her children's exploits and sympathizes with her fears and misgivings.A well-written story of life!"
1,Sticky jelly belly,"Received 20 lbs of the jelly bellies yesterday. They must have been stored improperly because they were all stuck together. Tasted ok, but they remain sticky even after de-clumping them."
4,Great Performance; Great Price,"This is a huge bargain...The DTS sound and Blu Ray picture is outstanding.The sets are grand in the traditional manner, the singing superb. The acting is great. The younger Germont (Vargas) sings very well, but he lacks the physical appearance that would make him as attractive as he should be. Gheorgiu gives a strong beautifuly acted performance.The orchesta and conducting are very fine.A great purchase."
5,Next best thing to being there.,"I have long enjoyed classical music and have heard La Traviata many times before. The sound quality,gorgeous scenes and vocals on this Blu Ray DVD are excellent. I'm holding off buying movies and will instead fill my collection with a few select operas like this and plan to enjoy them for many years to come."
4,"Really good, but...","Not much to add to the previous reviews. Excellent production, good singing from the three principals. But the acting or Mr. Vargas is pretty bad, his facial expression at the dramatic ""Amami Alfredo"" is embarassing to those that are following the pangs of Violetta. On the other hand, Ms. Georghiu's constant ""close mouth saliva production"" before she begins singing is a distraction to the viewers that are absorbed in the ongoing drama. Opera singers, used to the large theater stages and the safe distance from the live audience, should begin to be concerned with the close-ups the new media allows. Better yet, video producers should have moved the camera to another target everytime she begins pressing her lips, munching the void in search for a humid environment for her voice to reach our ears. Really ugly..."
2,Not worth the $$. Don't get this one.,"Stay away from this one. Less than so-so performance. Neither of the 2 leading singers impressed me and the tenor is the lesser of the 2. The DVD itself has some quality issues. Some sections' audio goes on and off (I tried my other BluRay DVDs later and made sure there was no problem with my player, and the DVD itself is very clean).I also have the 1999 DVD of Teresa Stratas & Plácido Domingo performing the same opera. Comparing the 2 DVDs breaks my heart that BluRay technology could be squandered like this, and proves yet again why Domingo is, well, Domingo."
4,Everyone should see this!,If you want to introduce your children (or adult friends & Family) this is the perfect opera in a remarkable format. The blu-ray features are impressive and vibrant...I found myself drawn into the story. For the price of this disc...it doesn't get any better. Enjoy! R Fox
4,"OK, not outstanding","I am no expert. This seemed to be recorded with lower resolution than some I have seen, and for a Blu-ray, not super impressive to me."
4,No Titles,"A marvelous production in every way - great singing - BUT - I could not access any titles on my DVD player. This has never happened to me before. Fortunately, I know the opera well and didn't need them.If you need the titles, this might be a problem."
5,La Traviata Looks So Good in Hi-Def,"I used to have the DVD of Decca version of La Traviata featuring Angela Gheorghiu. I liked it but this blu-ray provides a whole new experience with its great high definition vision and audio. Ms. Gheorghiu, as Violetta, performs amazingly in both singing and acting. It's great to observe all the details of the singer's facial expressions and gestures in hi-def. Mr. Vargas, as Alfredo, performs very well even though his acting is rather clumsy. The baritone, as the father, sings flawlessly. I thought the production was also excellent. I expected more from the Gypsy's dance/song but all in all this title deserves five stars.This is my very first opera title in blu-ray and I'm more falling in love with blu-ray after watching this Verdi's masterpiece. I know I'll be watching it over and over again especially the first act.Technically, it was shot in 1080i and features PCM 2.0 & DTS HDMA 7.1 audio track. No extras."
5,Original Band Vocalist,"I recorded this song with the Gary Toms Empire in Hempstead NY in 1975. I remember recording vocals, instruments and and the whistle on individual tracks. It was a very exciting time for me. The highlight of the bands success was when we appeared on ""American Band Stand"" with Dick Clark. The music is great and I hope that all of you continue to enjoy it."
2,not what we expected at all,It was a fun experience... But sucked that we had to rush... Then when we removed everything... It did NOT come out as smooth as they say in the directions and video. Very very disappointed
2,Okay,That texture was completely rigid from the plaster. Maybe we did it wrong but we have to use a condom or it makes her bleed. It was fun and she loves it though.
2,Don't buy,"I was NOT impressed. We ended up with a wierd looking half-sized ""mutant"" thing. I was a good sport and tried it anyway. OMG! The material it is made out if is way to hard and rough. It hurt!I am going to try a different manufacturer next time.EXTREMELY MESSY folks!"
2,"Lots of work, failed product.",The molding material hardened as soon as i got it in the tube. We were pretty bummed out to have gone through all the work without the reward.
4,"Fun to do, disappointed first time, but company came through in a big way","Disappointing.Apparently my willy is in the 4% they say is too large (I know, I know, tough problem *grin*). There's no way to know this ahead of time as the tube was long enough -- there just wasn't enough of the liquid rubber molding material to make a full, uh, object. So I ended up with about 2/3 of a willy with a vibrator sticking out in a very weird way.Empire Labs promptly responded and sent me a replacement kit with a larger vibrator. I'm looking forward very much to trying the new kit out -- I have every reason to think that with the larger vibrator, the mold will work to make a full length copy of my willy.Kudos to Empire Labs for turning a bummer into a plus!"
4,Not as hard to do as everyone says,"I got this thinking it would be fun to do with my boyfriend. We got everything set up and I went down on his to get him started. While mixing the powder and water together, he decided I get behind me and do the dirty to keep his length. I mixed (or attempted to mix) as we were getting down lol then he pulled out, stuck it in and gave me a little treat while we waited the 2 minutes. It kept his hard and me satisfied until we were done. After, we were both worked up and just got down in the kitchen while it dried. It makes a little mess but is very easy to clean up. I finished it up te next day and have yet to try it out but it feels a little harder than the real thing so idk how I will like it. But overall, it was alot easier to do than alot say and it looks really close to the real thing! :)"
4,fun but messy!,"Worked great but it gets a little messy. Follow the advice of others who have tried it first. Most importantly: plan ahead, read ALL the instructions first, be prepared, and have help. Do NOT attempt to do it by yourself as a surprise for your significant other (it really takes two people, and besides, it's fun to do together!). Not all penises are made the same, and it is likely your clone won't be perfect... but on the first try, ours came out decently! I am happy with the product and would consider buying a second to see if my technique and finished product come out even better the second time."
1,Poor quality,The powder set too quickly. It was impossible to make the cast because the powder hardened almost immediately. Now I have to order additional powder. Please consider when purchasing.
5,It works,It works and the person that got the clone says it is great. Little difficult to keep hard and work mold gel at same time. From time you add water till mold sets is two minutes and it is two minutes.
1,Do not attempt alone.,"I ordered this for my girlfriend whom lives across the nation. We thought it would be a great and sexy idea. It was more frustrating than anything. The product itself is a great concept, the way it works is not. The biggest flaw is that the gel hardens WAY to fast. You have about 2 minutes from the time you mix the gel compound with warm water, then it hardens. In those two minutes you must: mix the gel for 60 seconds, pour the gel into the tube, scrap all you can into the tube, get an erection again, then stick it into the tube. Even with a penis ring I still could not get an erection fast enough. The creators need to consider a slower-hardening gel. This product is near impossible to use alone. I would not suggest this product if your partner isn't there to take care of the mixing."
1,Not enough time,"Bought this item with hopes of surprising my wife, and found it to be impossible to do by yourself. You have 2 minutes MAX from the time the water hits the the mold putty until its unusable, it requires a good 1:15 to mix it and another 30 seconds to get it in the tube. By the time this ordeal is over and the stress of having only a few moments of time left good luck being in a position to be able to use those last few seconds. Severely disappointed with this product. Might work out if done with 2 people, but unless your partner is fine with you getting some assistance, find another solution."
1,Instructions not complete,"Do not buy this product. For some, there is insufficient moulding material in order to surround body part to be moulded. Instructions also do not advise to place body at downward angle. Better prodcut is one in a tub which you can position yourself over."
3,Solidifies too quickly,"I am a chemist, so measuring temperatures and mixing chemicals is something I do daily. I made sure the mixture had the exact right temperature and volume, and made sure to time it from the moment the powder came in contact with the water. Before the two minutes were up it was completely congealed and we were unable to insert the willy. So don't trust the instructions! Keep a VERY close eye on it and insert the willy sooner rather than later."
2,HOT STUFF....no really I mean like it could burn you hot!,"The idea of this item seemed to be a fun one. And for the most part the act of creating it was. We had a nice time creating it and thanks to other reviews on amazon we picked up extra molding clay, on the of chance that we screwed up the first time around. After making it we were pleased with the results. Thats when the problems started though. The vibrator gets very hot and actually burnt her junk man!!!!!"
3,Very Difficult To Use,"This kit is very difficult to use, but makes a fairly exact replica if done correctly. The most difficult part is the step to make the mold before you fill it with the rubber. I would recommend visiting the CloneAWilly website and purchasing the novice kit though. That kit comes with 3 bags of molding powder, so you can try it more than once."
5,Great for couples,"Guys, if you think this is just for women you could not be more wrong. I bought this for my girlfriend solely for use when we couldn't be together and thought the only fun I'd have was making it with her. Since then I've discovered surprising personal benefits. Not only is it unbelievably hot to use an exact copy of myself on my girl but I've noticed she's become much more adept at using my real [...]. Being able to experiment with it on her own taught her how to take advantage of every inch and, when were together, she's now in better control of her own orgasm. She also admits that always seeing it on her night stand has made the real thing less intimidating. She's now just as comfortable pulling the real one from my pants as she is the clone from next to her bed. This is one of the best toys for couples we've ever seen."
1,not enough materials to actually make it..,"the kit only contains enough jell material if you have a 4 inch penis. By the time you find out, your mold is only partially full and starting to set up. [...] In the very small print at the bottom, it suggests ordering a large vibrater to fill in the empty space, if your man is larger. Way to late!!!"
4,Worked but the Mrs. hates the feel of it,"This kit made a decently accurate copy of my willy, but the Mrs really does not like the way it feels, texture wise. As far as accuracy, its within 1/2 an inch on all specs but I definitely reccommend following the instructions to a T."
2,more of a novelty gift,This product seemed like it would be a real weiner (sorry for the pun) but fell short on a couple reasons. first of all its a very messy gel for the mold and on the finished product the rubber is pretty hard. and that would be fine but in the molding there were lots of imperfections or bubbles but that could have been on my part. there wasn't enough material to fully make my mold but I still gave it 2 stars 1 because of the price on Amazon and 2 because it was fun to make with a lot of help from my wife.
5,Great product,"This is one of the most fun products i have ever pruchased! Its so much fun to make and is not as hard as some youtube reviews make it seem. You are just under a time constraint. The product itself is fairly good quality. Got a perfect mold the first time, and had a blast doing it!"
3,empire labs clone a willy kit,"kit comes with everything needed. very affordable price. impression sets extremely fast. recommended two people project. rubber dries flaky due to impression not being smooth enough; only because we did not have enough time to mix and mold. rubber also dries pretty hard. not soft. it's okay, but i would not use it again."
1,Buyer Don't Buy from HEALTH TIME. Will Not Fix My Order,I order 1 of this product . I did get it. But I also order 5 of the (Clone a Willy Liquid Rubber refill). But only got 1. Also ordered 4 ( Clone a Willy Molding Powder) But only got 1. I have sent them 3 emails and they tell me they sent me all my order. When they did not. My order total cost was $167.03. They sent me $43.72 of my order. They well not send me the rest of my order or refund my $123.29 So I will never buy anthing that HEALTH TIME sells on Amaazon again. So if you see that the seller on the product is HEALTH TIME don't buy it from that seller. Us one of the other sellers that sell the same produt.I give them a 1 star cause I was not sure they would post my reveiw if I did not. If I could I would give them a-10 stars.David
1,Clone-a-willy disaster,"My boyfriend and I tried to use this kit. It was our first time and we had read the instructions several times. We had everything perfect until we poured the molding gel into the tube. It hardened up before he even had a chance to get into it. We didn't realize it hardened that quickly. We ended up having to throw the entire thing away. In my opinion, it was the worst idea ever. He was in pain most of the afternoon afterwards from the molding gel bending him up. The company should really send extra gel mix in case you mess up, that way, you don't spend $20-40 (depending where you buy it) only to throw the entire kit away before you get to the fun part."
1,Really pissed off,"So I bought this because I thought it would be absolutely wonderful my boyfriend was in jail and he got out for a day and had to go back. So I thought well the day hes out we could use this nifty little thing and it was just a disaster. The powder turns to jell instantly (which we knew it did fast but we both sat there wondering how much faster we could have done it?) The product says its okay if your touching the side when you make it COMPLETE lie one side comes out container shaped and its almost impossible to get out of the packaging later. The ""product"" turnout was a rubber piece of rectangular plastic that looks nothing like any kind of vibrator or ""willy"" I've ever seen. Last time I checked my boyfriends member was not a rectangle."
5,An absolute must for any student of architecture.,"Hertzberger clearly exposes the anatomy of architectural and urban elements and analyzes them for the student with direct references to architectural precedents. What helps make this book a masterpiece for the student is the diversity of his examples; examples culled from living Western and Eastern cultures as well as elements of his own archtitectural works. The book focuses on form and plan derived from human experience and need: both physiological and psychological. What sets this text apart from other works is that rather than teach style, Hertzberger uncovers the symptoms which generate form, allowing the student to develop his own tectonic vocabulary."
3,NOT BAD,"I saw a TV segment wherein a chef specified the use of ""Japanese mayonnaise"" in a recipe, so I Googled it and found it on Amazon. It comes in a very soft, pliable, plastic container, kind of floppy (Phthalates???). It isn't much different than American Mayonnaise but does differ in a couple of areas. It is a bit more tart and tastes more ""egg'y"" to me. It says it's made with ""vegetable oil"". Not sure what that is comprised of, possibly all or part soy, which is something I am trying to stay away from since, if it's not organic, is genetically engineered (GMO). If the phthalates and the GMO aspect are not an issue with you, go ahead and try it."
1,Japanese Mayo,"OK....I thought I'd put a bit of punch to hubby's sandwich, instead of the ho-hum Best Foods Mayo---ohOoooOh--FAILURE!One bite and he said---Please! DO NOT EVER SERVE THIS TO ME AGAIN!I guess it was that-bad!I'll see if my neighbor will be able to use it w/her family.If you are a BEST FOODS lover---walk away---do NOT purchase this product!"
3,Tastes like Miracle Whip with MSG,"I have been making okonomiyaki quite often lately, but I have always topped it with American mayo, like Hellman's or Duke's. I finally bought some Kewpie today because I kept hearing about how it's so much better for okonomiyaki. I must say that I'm not really a fan. It just tastes like Miracle Whip (I've always hated it) with MSG. I'll be sticking with the American stuff after this is gone."
4,Tasty,"I was told about this stuff at a party and, as a lover of Mayonnaise, thought I'd buy some. I don't use it a lot, but it's pretty good on fries. I imagine it will make a great tunafish sandwich too. If you've never had it before, it tastes a lot like traditional Mayo but considerably more vinegar-y. Some people who don't like Mayo have told me they like this."
4,M-Audio Keystation 61es,"All in all this seems like a pretty nice keyboard. I bought mine used, so I'm not sure if it's a manufacturing fault or the previous owner, but a couple of the black keys need to be pushed a little harder than the others. This isn't too big of an issue, I still really enjoy this keyboard and would recommend it to a friend."
3,"Good, but not the best","It does good for what it is built for.I play very heavy-handed: I grew up playing on a grand and also have a fully-weighted digital piano. I play very heavy. After a few months of playing on this, the key C4 lost its touch sensitivity. This is annoying as all get-out, as that note will not sound above a MIDI velocity of about 64. For how I use this, it almost makes this useless to me now."
3,Keys hard to play.,"The keyboard is functioning perfect, my only concern is regarding the action of the keys, feels so hard.Is light and like that."
1,Do Not Buy No Longer Supported by M-Audio!,"I purchased one which stopped working. I am told that the company was sold. No one has manuals or parts.Stay away from M-Audio if you want any type of ""customer support"". Actually there is very little customer support to be found anywhere these days where the bottom line (profit) is a new form of worship."
2,Maybe just bad luck..,"Mine came with a problem with the pitch bend, once you move it the software app wouldn't go back to 0. It would stay quarter tone up which makes it unusable.USB plastic input broke too."
1,Never has worked,"I should have never bought this keyboard. I knew that almost from the minute of purchase. Way too much for a child. Besides it has never worked. My son who is very, very good with all things electronic still has not gotten it to make the first sound. It sits in the closet."
4,organ controller,"I've been using this as a controller for a Voce V3 ""Hammond B3 simulator"" syth module for several years now. The square edged keys are close to the feel of real Hammond waterfall keys. The term ""semi-weighted"" means that the keys are light but do generate velocity information so you can do piano type sounds fine, they just won't feel as good as a fully weighted (and MUCH heavier) keyboard. We also use it for computer input (terrific) and with it's compact size and weight can be easily moved around as needed."
4,Great for Recording Studio!,I plugged this into my iMac with the provided USB cable and Garage Band picked it up immediately. My daughter was playing on it within 30 seconds of unpacking. I researched quite a bit before buying and I am glad I chose this one. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it had one more output option to go to a speaker but it is great for what I needed.
4,"Good, key action could be better",This is a pretty decent basic keyboard. I only wish the key action were better. It feels cheap and getting any sort of nuance out of it is difficult for at least me.
5,Best investment ever!,"I got this keyboard when I was visiting family in the U.S. and needed something to practice and write my music on.This is the only keyboard I found with semi-weighted keys which comes in 3 sizes (49, 61 or 88 keys)the touch feel is great! it also has on board controls for volume, velocity, pitch bend and advanced controls.it comes with a USB or MIDI inputs as well as an analog output and AC input if you don't want to use the USB.they keyboard itself is very light-weighted and is carry-able if you need to travel with it.overall it was one of the best investments I've made in a long time!"
2,Inexpensive but has quality problem,"The included USB driver would not work on my Windows XP PC. The included Live Lite software 6 is out-of-date (current version is 8), crippled and limited in functions and the number of virtual instruments. The keys feel heavy and uncomfortably bouncy. The only positive thing is the price. Good for a starter, I guess."
1,lead paint verified by M-Audio,"I have to give this product the lowest possible rating, because of the lead paint.I contacted M-Audio for clarification on the lead warning, and they replied that the external paint does indeed contain lead; the warning is NOT just based on internal circuitry with lead content.When M-Audio switches to a lead free paint, I will re-evaluate. Until then, parents beware.Lead is a known neurotoxin. From reading some of the comments about the lead warning here, especially from the person that sees no problem with lead and licks the keyboard, it appears that damage has already been done."
2,Beware...,"A beautiful tea kettle that looks great and works well. But within a week of usuing it the plastic that holds the handle melted an now looks pretty bad. The burner was up a little too high and it melted the plastic. I do take some of the blame for this, should not have had the flame up so high, but wouldnt you think a tkettle should be able to handle pretty high heats since it designed to be on for the stove top? Just beware."
5,Amazing,"This is a landmark in M9 recordings. For my taste, i think this is theBEST recording of this symphony by Lenny. It has not only the best sound,but the best playing from a top form Concertgebouw orchestra. It`s reallya matter of wonder how Lenny could sustain this music in these expansivetempi so compellingly. This is a must for Bernstein discography."
3,Not good enough.,"The 1st Bernstein recording of this symphony was my first Mahler. Since then I've been on a quest to find all the great Mahler recordings. The sound in the earlier Berny 9th is muted some but the flow and emotion of the piece seems to be the best I can find.In the first recording the sinister themes in the 1st movement that follow and creep along behind the beautiful characters make great good and evil contrast. This stuff,if I may, is missing in many of the other 9th's. Probably Bernstein exagerating an existing smaller detail? Well,this 9th was not as varied emotionally and with my relationship with Mahler I want alot of this up and down emotion. The Berlin Berny is better than this. Karajan's, yes also..."
3,Unexciting,"This performance of the Mahler 9 was a huge dissapointment to me. The most important flaw is that the last movement is way too slow and long. I always seem to find myself looking at the ticker on my CD player to see how much longer until the movement is over. The second movement doesn't really do anything for me, it is made up of three themes which have so much potential that Berstein does not expose. The first movement again is unexciting, only during the loud roars of the trumpets does this movement have the room filling emotion of a Mahler Symphony. I think he does a good job with the third movement, it is very intense and wild, and the sound quality is great on this recording, too bad the performance isn't as great."
5,Definitely in my top 5 of all time!!,"I actually own the CD ""Without The Aid Of A Net"". As mentioned in another review, the tracks are exactly the same on this CD.I have followed a lot of bands and I have seen a lot of live shows throughout the years. This CD has the most magic and positive energy of any live record or CD that I have ever heard (Frampton Comes Alive is probably the only other album that comes close).I highly recommend it - music written and played straight from the heart - I play it anytime that I feel like experiencing some magic.Starts off acoustic and then gets into heavier tracks. The first 6 tracks just meld together into a powerful acoustic energy boost. From 7 to 14, it almost seems like the 2nd part of a journey.Shame about Stuart - but he has left a legacy.Try it - you'll like it!!"
3,Pretty god Scottish folkrock,"Big Country is maybe the most known band fusioning Scottish folk with rock. The Greatest Hits Live is exactly what the title says... but their best song ever (AND greatest hit ever, I believe?) Fields Of Fire is missing!Most of the songs are quite OK, and the charming Scottish remarks from the lead singer plus the faithful home crowd makes this a real LIVE album.Fourteen songs, however, is a bit too much of the same genre - the biggest disadvantage of CD's in general remains that the selection of songs is not selective enough!Oddly, The Greatest Hits Live becomes better and better towards the end of the album; the last five songs are the best ones. The highlights are Ships and Lost Patrol!"
2,"Good performance, antiquated recording","My kids and I have much enjoyed this recording, but the narration is often too quiet and sounds a bit muffled. Moreover, the narrator speaks with a British accent, making comprehension a bit trickier for little ones. In general, I have missed the sound quality obtained in digital recordings, so I'm now shopping for a better recording of this wonderful piece of music."
4,Norah Norah Norah,"Really liked it; and I think that as she grows and matures, her music will become even richer."
2,I wish I had checked it out on Amazon.com FIRST...,"I bought the latest album on an impulse when I saw it on the check-out counter at Starbucks. It sounds like Norah isn't even trying - no heart, no soul."
2,A better singer than a songwriter,The songs on this album are sub-par. Norah Jones has a wonderful voice and is less than mediocre as a songwriter. After her wonderful debut album and a good second album I expected a LOT more.
2,So-So,"I bought this after seeing her recent interview with somebody or other. I loved her first two CDs, expected to love this one. But I consider it just so-so.A little lackluster. Borders on the irritating. My daughter, who has also loved her past CDs made no comment.So-so."
1,"Liked the first two albums, but this one sucked.","Not one memorable song on it. The first track is sort of alright, but then it all goes downhill from there."
3,Not as great as....,Was okay but my husband who is really into Norah really did not like to many of the songs.Definately the darker side of Norah.Not as great a purchase as Norah Jones Come Away With Me.
5,Lovely and Mellow,"Those who are critical because Nora Jones' music is too low keyed and mellow just don't get it. That is what Nora Jones' music is all about. Laid back, soft, and relaxing, easy listening music...Good to kick back, relax and chill with.As far as her political comments, she's not the first, or the last musically talented performer to incorporate political statements in their music. So put aside this issue, and listen to the instrumentation, and the voice, then dim the lights, relax and enjoy this music the way it was meant to be..."
4,Not Too Late for Norah,"I love Norah Jones minimalist style and I had high hopes for this album. I was not disappointed... well mostly not disappointed. It doesn't capture the impact and excitment of her debut but then again what could? It was an amazing, historic album. I kind of think this album needs to be taken as a whole - for me there wan't a stand-out hit - but it is one of the few albums I've listended to in recent years where I can sit and listen to the whole thing and enjoy it."
2,Too much of the same,"After Norah's first two CDs and the Little Willie's CD I was greatly looking forward to this release. To say the least I am disappointed. I was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep. Where is the range of work? All of the songs on this CD sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me. I'm giving it 2 stars just because of Norah's angelic voice, otherwise I'd have to give this one a 1 star rating."
1,Norah Jones,"As much as I love this artist and enjoyed greatly her first two cd's, this one falls very short for me. I don't think there is enough mass appeal and many of the songs seem to run together in style, tone and rhythm."
3,I've heard better from Norah,"I love to listen to Norah Jones,but I liked her first two albums the best. This was good, but I won't be playing it over and over like the first two."
2,Just doesn't work like her other albums,"When I first got this, I had also gotten several other albums and didn't really pay much attention to it. I loved Norah's first two releases, but ""Not Too Late"" didn't grab me right away (the politicized stuff was noteworthy only in that it was blatant and had been talked about in reviews), so I kind of forgot about it for a while. When I recently loaded it back up on my MP3 player for a listen with fresh ears several months later, I was actually disappointed. I don't know if it's the new songwriting, or if it's the baggage of ""political writing"" that weighs down what used to be very evocative work, or if it's just Norah fatigue, but I just didn't get into it. There are a couple of good tracks that I'd rather append to 'Come Away With Me' as my personal version of bonus tracks, but overall, I don't care for this work."
3,Latest from Norah Jones,"More of same - luckily I like Norah Jones. I wish she'd branch out and explore different musical styles...perhaps more serious collaborations with other equally talented musicians. I'd love to be actually listenting to her rather than just having her as pleasant background music. She could do more, but I'm happy to add this latest to my collection."
4,Love Her,This obviously is not as good as her first album but is still really good. She has a unique sound and a great voice.
5,"NORAH JONES , YOU LITTLE MINX !!!!!!!","IF YOU LIKED HER FIRST RECORD , WELLYOU HAVE TO GET THIS ONE . IT IS A JOYTO LISTEN TO & I NEVER GET TIRED OF IT !""SINKING SOON"" WILL AMAZE YOU IN ITSBIZARRE JAZZY FUNERAL MARCH TO GOD KNOWS WHEREAND MOST OF THE OTHER SONGS ARE BRILLIANTAS WELL . SHE IS A TRUE GEM & PURE PLEASURETO LISTEN TO . I CAN'T WAIT TO GET HER 2009RELEASE DUE OUT NOW . I LOVE THIS CD !!!!!AND THAT DRESS !!! AUSTIN POWERS WOULD GROWL ,GRRRRRRRRRR.......OH BEHAVE !!! CHECKITOUT ."
2,"Great voice, but...","Norah Jones is a great artist and I love her voice. However, I found the selections on this album to be WAY too ""mellow"". I was ready to drift off to sleep within a few minutes. The numbers all sounded alike, and Norah's range was not at all highlighted. She's recorded much better albums - try to listen to some of these selections before purchasing; if you like them, great, if not, you haven't spent a dime!"
3,snorah jones,norah jones thinks this is her best album.i think shes wrong.this is by far her worst album.her first cd was her best album.her second cd showed growth.this cd is flat out boring and a creative fallback.this album only works if you have run out of your sleeping pills and need to fall asleep
5,Very nice album.,"I enjoyed the album, as I have all Norah Jones' works. May she issue many more albums."
3,Was a little disapointed...,"I preordered this CD a month before it was released. I anticipated it to be as smooth and perfect as her first two albums but I can honestly say the style is different than what I expected. I know it's good to change styles every now and then to show versatility. However, what drew me to her music was the sweet sound of her voice in a soft jazzy tones. This album was not as good as the first two in my opinion."
4,Love the CD..but the DVD wasn't worth it.,"I love the CD. It's one of my new favorites! However, I paid extra to get the DVD and I wished I hadn't. It's nothing too exciting. Has some music videos and interviews, but not worth the extra money."
2,Disappointed of this new album,"I have all her 3 albums and this is the worst album among all. Some more I purchased the imported version from Japan, maybe my expectation of this album is too high and end up not that good. That's why quite disappointed here. Her voice still nice but don't feel any special of the songs. I like her first album the most and never bored of listening this album."
2,"Nice, but.....","well, that's all I can say. Norah sounds nice, soothing as usuall, but she doesn't sound refreshing or that musically creative or anything. If this album were her debut, it definitely won't be a breakout for her or anybody. But it's Norah, if you are a fan, 10 bucks is really nothing, just to hear her soothing voice. Otherwise, there are lots better albums worthy of your money. Like Amy Winehouse, Corrine Bailey Ray, or Robin Thicke, Paolo Nutini, James Morrison."
1,Very disappointing,"I loved Norah's first CD but no so much the second, and now this is even worse. It's really sleep inducing at best! It's time for a change Norah and a bit more life to your music. Who can listen to an entire CD of such slow songs and manage to stay awake through it? A little diversity isn't a bad thing you know."
2,A skipper....,"I was dissappointed with Not Too Late. Too blend, boring at times. I do really believe that Norah is great at live performances. But not at home, or in the car listening to her CDs..definitely not this new CD."
5,Norah is amazing,"What qualifies someone to critique someone's craft? There are as many types and sounds to music as there are entertainers. Whether it is good, bad, or just so-so depends on one's individual taste. I personally wouldn't write a review of something I couldn't give at least 3 stars to. Why bash someone's art just because you don't personally care for it?TO ME, this cd is melodic, rich in spirit, and so soothing to listen to. Norah Jones has an amazing voice and is a very talented song writer. I wonder where all of the ""critics'"" songs and cds are and how they are selling? lol"
3,Not Too Late - Norah Jones,"There are only a couple of songs on this collection that I enjoy. ""Come Away With Me"" is a better collection."
3,Disappointing Trend,"I loved Norah's first album, her second was good, but not as good, the third had me wondering and this last album is a real disappointment. I think Norah believes she has to have dark and somber themes in order to be considered a serious artist, but her strength lies in her soothing, comforting, sensuous, ""wrap me in a warm blanket"" voice, which is largely absent from this work."
3,"Great Music, awful media!","I love Norah Jones, and the music on this disc is as incredible as ever. My big problem is the media onto which it is burned. The disc is copyright protected, so that not only will it not play on my computer, but I can not put the music on my MP3 player. It's outrageous that I am punished for doing the right thing. If I want to listen to this on my ipod (which is where 98% of the music I listen to comes from) I will have to either steal the music off of the internet, or pay for it again from Itunes.Had I known I would had this problem, I would have bought it from itunes in the first place. The music is great, but do yourself a favor and download it. Don't pay these companies to offer you less content."
1,Dissapointed,I loved Norah Jones first 2 Cds and awaited the arrival of this offering with great anticipation. But I guess its just too hard to keep up that level of perfection. Anyway I do not like this CD very much at all. It sounds stale and uninteresting and I think Miss Jones blew it with tis one.
2,Not her best work,"I love almost everything Norah Jones does, but this CD is a yawn festival. It doesn't have the hook that her other work has. I would wait for this one to go on sale before buying."
4,Norah's Not too Late,"""Not too late"" is good listening when playing on a car CD. Why? it's easier to hear the words she is singing. When I listen with my laptop and ear phones I get the stereo effect missed with older speakers. I was dissappointed to find out after I purchased the CD that a DVD was packaged with the CD in local stores.Herb Garrett"
4,Mature Listening,It can be said that Norah Jones' sound can be found in any New York City coffeehouse. It is that reason why I buy her albums. The music on this album is soothing and easy on the ears. The newborn baby does not seem to mind her songs either. I enjoy listening to this album when driving or going on long road trips.
4,Nice for a stormy day,"This album is more subdued than Norah's other stuff...but then again, some might call that maturity! Regardless, Norah has an amazing voice and her style is all her own. This album just makes me think of bundling up on a cold rainy day with a book and this playing in the background."
