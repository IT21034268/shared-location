4,Strange bedfellows...,"...meaning Tori Amos produced this album, distinctly unlike anything she ever wrote. I really do like it, though, because it is so different. The lyrics are wonderful although the music itself takes a little bit of geting used to. I like to put Pet on rotation with Nine Inch Nails and Tori, it makes for a good sound. Another good sign is that I always put at least one of their songs on any mix tape I make for someone else. Definitely worth getting."
5,Amazingly frothy milk!,"Wonderful little gadget- it is strong, works like a charm and makes the most long-lasting, frothy milk. Strongly recommended for those who want a little fancy coffee in the morning, without the fuss (or expense) of going to a Starbucks."
3,I expected more,"The case is nice for this frother. The plastic is light and not as heavy weight as I expected. The length of the frother is not as long as the one i just retired. I miss the longer stem. The on switch is cheap and not solid. My previous frother had an area on the top that you depressed to turn it on. I know that is what I am used to, but that is more convenient than this switch which is on the side. You slide this one, and it is not a smooth action and sticks somewhat. The speed of this frother is much slower than my previous model. I purchased this based on the good reviews it received, and based on my experience, it is just OK. It does the job, but it is definitely not the quality of the model I had before which lasted 8 years. The old one I have is still working, but the spring around the bottom came off and is lost. I am going to continue to shop for another one."
4,Good value for price,Bought this to use with my Keurig for making morning coffee drinks. Works very well for the price and produces lots of frothed milk very quickly.
4,Easy to use and works well!,Very convenient for regular use in the kitchen or on the go! Will froth both cold and warmed milk or cream.
1,Does not work,This is my third frother. II bought the first one 8 yes ago maybe. It worked well then broke after a long while. I purchased two in the last few years. Neither worked at all. Just big bubbles that quickly dissipate. So disappointing. I don't recommend this product.
1,Only worked for 6 months...,"This frother was amazing for the first 4-5 months. Then it became increasingly unstable. It would work only if I held down the battery cover very firmly. Then after using it for only 7 months, it stopped working. I tried to email the manufacturer but the email address on my guarantee is not valid. I am very disappointed."
3,OK but.....,"I'm not super thrilled with the Aerolatte 13 milk frother. I guess it does an OK job in frothing the milk; however, it is very noisy, the batteries rattle inside the handles and the ""on"" button has to be held down during use. Just not what I expected but not worth the $ to ship it back."
3,Make's Frappe,"As Greek's we love our Frappe's, and I do not have the room in the house for a frappe maker. This was the best alternative especially since it is battery operated. I had one that was electric before and found that after 1 year of use the button stopped working properly and it became a hassle to find an outlet in a small kitchen.This was the best and does whip up things just fine. The only thing that has me marking it as 3 is that when there is a lot of liquid, the speed of this tends to slow drastically... which can pose a problem if the foamy part is thick as sometimes it can be. Other than that, you get what you paid for, and the item did come in a timely manor."
1,Do not buy this book if you want to use it for grappling tech,"I made the mistake of purchasing this book thinking it would be a good source of information on grappling. From the title I would have expected some coverage of holding techniques or pins used in Judo or Jujitsu. The submission explanation are below par. The only part of the book I found useful was the chokes and choke defenses.Any of the Gracie, Machado or even the Judo books are much better than this."
4,The Essential Handbook to the Marvel Universe Vol. 1...,"If you grew up in the eighties and you read Marvel Comics, then you may remember this series. This was the series to get and collect back then as you could get the skinny on all the characters and maps to all their headquarters and hidden cities. The fact that they have reprinted the original 15 issue run in one essentials edition is fantastic and you get it all here. The only reason this review isn't 5 stars is that the information is over twenty-three years old.This book is great for general knowledge of the Marvel Universe, finding out who the characters are (in a general way...) and giving you all fifteen issues for a little over a dollar an issue. If you play role playing games based in the Marvel Universe (either TSR's original Marvel, the Saga system or the new Diceless system) than this book is a must as it not only provides an unparalleled source of information for you the buyer, but for your players in your game as well."
1,"Total junk, be forewarned.","This same dongle is sold by other suppliers here at Amazon, and the reviews there are all the same: tough to install software, won't run, if you download and upgrade the software, it asks for $20 license, shoddy construction. All reviews the same. I wish I had seen one of those articles instead of this one, so I would have been forewarned what a rotten product this is.Oh more good news. I just popped it open (with a fingernail) and guess what. The antenna is just a solid piece of plastic - it's a dummy that doesn't even connect to anything inside - what a joke!If you want to buy something that takes a couple hours of frustration trying to install, requires an extra $20 for a license, with fake parts and shoddy construction, be my guest!!But be forewarned. It's cheap because it's total junk!!"
1,Cheap and useless,"Dekcell CPA-1016 Bluetooth Wireless USB Dongle Adapter with Antenna, up to 328ft RangeBought the product in January and install with a great deal of trouble. Did not ever work properly, and in March stopped working completely. Yes the antenna is only for show there is no function to this except to take up more space."
1,Defective headband,"yea they sound great, the bluetooth signal is awesome crystal clear with no hiss or pop or fading in an out. The bad part is the headband breaks for no reason other than just using it. Now I got a $50 piece of junk that I can't use"
2,Excellent Sound BUT....,"The first time I got this set, I was amazed at the sound. Fortunately, I did not have the ""breaking band"" problem like others did but, I have 2 big issues; these headphones are devastatingly uncomfortable and heavy on the ears. Also, after just 3 months (bought this thing new)of tolerating the discomfort, the battery in the headset refused to hold a charge for more than 3 minutes. Dispite the lack of comfort and overall poor quality of this product, I still gave it 2 stars becasue the sound is terrific."
2,Disappointed - breaks easily,"These headphones have already broken. At the center of the neck band the plastic has already cracked/split and are basically useless. I am very disappointed with the quality of the plastic used, although the headphones themselves worked very well."
2,great if they kept working,"The wireless headphones are great....except one of the two sets I purchased quit working after a couple of weeks. I also paid an exorbitant charge for shipping to get them in time for Christmas, but they still didn't come in time. So we loved the product, when it worked, but not the service."
2,DO NOT PURCHASE: LOGITECH HAS DISCONTINUED THIS PRODUCT,"I just got off the phone with Logitech Tech Support. My headset broke like everyone else's, and they're not replacing the product -- they're refunding the purchase price.The tech support agent told me they're out of stock, they're not manufacturing these anymore, and they have no plans to manufacture an improved version of the product.This is a shame, because the Bluetooth functionality and sound quality are excellent.So, why two stars instead of one? If you are a DIY type, and think you can reinforce the central two inches of the headset, then go for it. But buyer beware!"
2,"Cool idea, but poor design","The headset band broke on my pair as well, after a few months of gentle usage. It will probably break on yours, too, if you buy these. Beware!"
2,just waiting for the third pair to break as well...,"Yes they break and they're to tight they definitely wont come off, when running or shaking your head violently.They must be made for pygmae-heads, my heads is 56cm around, which is normal adult size and they are too small.I had them exchanged twice as they broke within 2-3months of purchase/replacement and I am now waiting for the third pair to break, then I have to have them replaced again.The sound is quite good and the wireless freedom is brilliant, which is why they receive two stars from me, but the breaking and tightness is annoying.Until Logitech improves the design - DO NOT BUY THEM!!!(I have contacted logitech to inform them about the problem, please do the same, maybe some day they will listen)"
2,best headphones i ever owned .. exept,i had bought 4 pairs of these ..1 after anotherthe sound was great the prob was they kept breakingi would recomend this headphone butnot when it comes to the breaking ..my first pair lasted a month .. the second lasted 2 weeks .. and it just goes on from thereso be warned they will break .. but there really good headphones
3,"Good sound, headband breaks consistently",I bought these and was excited about them. After a short time though the headband broke. I complained and was eventually sent a new pair. They told me the first batch was bad. A month or so later the headband started to crack again. I wouldn't buy these again which is sad since they have the best sound and bluetooth connectivity but the headband cracks and it stops working.
2,Not what I really wanted,"This headset only works if you have a very bulky transmitter plugged in. It is not very portable, maybe can be used in the car or at home, but not something you really want to lug around with you. I was hoping that the transmission of my phone could be picked up by the headset, but it only works with the bulky transmitter in the package."
3,Foolsgold - Logitech MP3 Wireless Headphones,I was so pleased after 1 month of use that I purchased another set for work. Then the fun began. The first set snapped in two Amazon passed me onto the seller and the seller never responded. I checked out the second set and could see a crack on the frame. Notified the seller and was advised this product was refurbished and I needed to deal with Logitech. The Idea is great but this product is junk!!! Amazon will do nothing!! And the Vedors will do nothing!!
2,Terrible ergonomics ruin an otherwise good product,"This is a perfect example of a terrific idea that is poorly implemented.Logitech did a good job with the technology, but these headphones fail miserably in the ergonomics department.The Bluetooth (2.0) works very well. I easily get the advertised 30ft range. As others mention, the sound is a little muddy. But adjusting the mp3 player's EQ settings helped quite a bit. With these adjustments, I would rate the sound quality as ""acceptable"".But the headphones themselves are a torture device. I have never worn a more uncomfotable set of headphones. The are very tight and hurt after only 10 minutes of wear. In addition the band that goes behind the neck rides very low and interferes with the collar of collared shirt.It's so frustrating. If Logitech had just gone with a normally designed headphones, these would be fantastic.I am going to return my pair."
3,Not bad - hopefully better models come out down the line...,"I've just purchased the Logitech Wirelss Phones and all in all I'm pleased. Excellent sound quality, easy setup and easy to use. I'm not the most tech savvy person in the world but I already had the phones and adapter charging within 10 minutes out of the box, and was listening to them a few hours later. Drawbacks to these phones are they're slightly big, which doesn't bother me (I'm a fairly big guy) but I can see how perhaps women or younger kids may find them uncomfortable when worn for an extended period of time, it is a little bulky. On a hot day or during exercise I find them very uncomfortable, as the foam virtually covers both my ears, making it hotter than I'd already like to be. I'll still use regular earbuds on those days.For the ride to and from work or for a walk around the block it's great, but anything more strenuous I think buds are a better choice. Hopefully someday soon wireless earbud phones will be on the market!"
1,"Headband cracks, wire disconnects","1st set cracked in the center of the headband after about a month. Once the crack appears the headset starts to disconnect the wires at the crack and the headset stops working entirely. 2nd replacement set cracked after about two weeks. That was over a year ago, I didn't bother replacing it because why bother. Then I found out they were issuing a different design entirely as replacements (freepulse). Don't bother with this design unless it's free."
2,it WILL crack! not a matter of chance here.,"his and the white version of wireless headphone for ipod is being clearanced elsewhere for a good reason. I got one and it really cracks just by being flexed often enough, which is really unavoidable no matter how careful you are. It is only a matter of time. Mine cracked within a week, and yes I knew about the problem beforehand and was very careful. Unless you have a really small head (maybe the size of a softball), don't mind a cracked band or enjoy going through customer service, don't get it. it looks and sounds good otherwise, and works with computer bluetooth adaptors provided that you have software driver support for high quality bluetooth audio (a2dp). it's a pity."
1,Logitech Wireless Headphones for MP3,"Great sound quality, moderately comfortable, but not built well for daily use. The day I received the headset it cracked. I returned the broken one for a replacement and after a week of cautious daily use, it broke again. I'm not sure if anyone else has experience this problem. I was very disappointed since in the past, I have been very happy with Logitech's quality."
2,Mine broek Twice. Slow service,Mine broke first time. Took forever to get replacements. Second set broke also. Returned for refund. Took forever to get refund.
2,"Good Design, Bad Execution","I have been looking for a Bluetooth headphone for a while now and when I found the Logitech headphones it was the design that I was looking for. A small headset that is wireless and it didn't look like a studio headset. I got the headset in December and it worked well for about 3 weeks and then developed the crack that other reviewers have described. I got a replacement headphone and it also developed a crack in less than a week even when I tried to be careful when handling it. If it wasn't for the crack, I would have easily rated the headphones 4 stars. Amazon was very helpful when I reported the problem and I got a full refund after I returned the headphone."
1,Junk,I bought these and in my opinion it was a huge waste of money. First: They do not plug into my MP3 player very well. It is very loose and constantly comes off if you have this in a poket or bag. Two: It took me a good long while to get the things to even work. I can't get equal sound quality to come out of both sides. This makes listening to these headphones very difficult and irritating. Three: I do not like the design (they are very uncomfortable) and they break very easily like most of these other reviews mention. My suggestion in retrospect is to wait a little while until better products (for less money I might add) come out. It's only a matter of time. Hope this is helpful.
3,Good buy.,"Received quickly and in perfect working order. Have since lost the adapter for them, but that was my own fault...hehe... recommend them...good buy..."
5,Good reliable wireless headphones,"I am not one for wires on any headset. We tried other wireless headsets and either the battery did not last, or the headset was flimsy or it would lose connection with the mp3. This one is consistent, comfortable and very reliable. Plus the battery lasts for quite a long time."
2,Logitech will replace if headband breaks,"The headband on these is poorly designed. Unless you have a very small head, they are uncomfortably tight. They are also fragile - in spite of being very careful with them (I wear them only at my computer), the band developed a small crack within a month of purchase, exactly in the middle of the band. 3 months later, it was cracked far enough to break the wires, and they stopped working.I called Logitech support and described my problem. They immediately offered to replace them, and by simply sending the broken ones back I will receive a new set. Since these are discontinued, Logitech is sending me a set of the Freepulse headphones (metal headband, no more cracking plastic).Logitech Support's phone number has changed from what is posted in earlier reviews, is now 646-454-3200."
2,Tight,"For those of you with big noggins, these are NOT for you. They will give you a headache after 15 minutes of wear. Good sound quality though..."
3,Double Edged Sword,These things worked awesome for like 3 months and now the freaking receiver is not responding to the headset!
4,Excellent Bluetooth from Logitech,1. Good Design - comfortable to wear2. Easy installation - fast connect3. I am using it with PC and radio4. Actually around 7-8 meters you receive good connection and sound excellent5. Hope Logitech to provide one with mic6. Charge it after 5 hours using
2,Bad design,"The technology is great, but give it a few weeks and the headband begins to crack. They designed the band with a studier material because the headphones are a bit heavier than normal headphones. Unforunately, this means the headband cracks after prolonged use. Mine cracked after a week's worth of use. After this they are useless. Check the Logitech support forums for more information. This isn't an isolated problem, but a design problem with all the headphones. I would not recommend this product, since they are so expensive with such a short life span. Maybe wait till they fix the headband.They work great until they break."
4,"Versatile, Good Sound, but heavy","This Bluetooth 1.2 version has since been replaced by the newer generation, but the price of this model has come down by nearly $80 as a result. I've used them for working out in front of a TV (if you equip your set with an inexpensive 3.5 mm audio out jack), listening to iPod, portable dvd player in the car, and computer. Pros: The sound is quite clear and true, provided you aren't an overly demanding audiophile. The single charger has a Y-shaped adapter end permitting charging of both the adapter and headset simultaneously. Cons: they are considerably heavier than corded headphones and become a bit uncomfortable after an hour."
2,Great Sound but Poor Headband Plastic,"Logitech has a potentally great product here, but it suffers from a fatal flaw which remains (as of 2006-06-21) uncorrected. As others have stated, after a few hours of use, the headband cracks in the middle.It is unclear if Logitech is currently replacing the headphones or refunding the purchase price when you report it to Logitech.Other than this physical flaw, the headphones sound excellent.If you are looking for competing products try Creative's version of the same idea, the Creative SL3100 or CB2530"
2,"Not worth it, try another","I now have 2 of these that are broken. They break right in the back (and then pinch your neck). The first pair stopped working because of the break and Logitech did send me a replacement pretty quick. They had said they knew of the problem and fixed it, but the second pair broke again. I am not rough with these, but I think using them everyday at work just wears on them quick. You have to pull them out a little to get them on your head. Now that my second pair is broken they no longer stay on my ears well. I am very disappointed. I love the wireless aspect of these headphones and the quality of sound is great. They also have a great range. Now they just don't stay on anymore and are too uncomfortable. The first pair I got were really tight on my head and maybe that is why they broke in the first place."
2,Poor Headset Design,The sound was good but the headset design was poor. Product broke after 2 days of wearing.
3,Great while they last,"Brilliant quality, superbly easy to use, and supports A2DP. Loved them for the two weeks I had them, but then after nothing but careful use, they snapped across the back (what a stupid design). Logitech customer service is excellent, so I'm getting a new one at no charge arriving tomorrow, but I don't think it's unlikely that those'll snap soon enough too.Other than that, though, brilliant."
5,Product best of its kind - Crack can be fixed,"First of all these headphones have great sound quality, are easy to use, and are pretty much the best of its kind on the market at the moment. But like im sure most of you who have bought these are noticing is that the headphones ARE eventually gonna crack down the middle of the band and although this isn't something you would expect from $130 headphones(especially Logitech)the crack can be mended with black electrical tape-barely noticible unless closely examined and will prevent a deeper crack if tape is applied tightly.Hope This Helps"
3,sounds very good but not built good!,first they broke down the middle and i jus taped it then a week later they stopped working all together..... my best friend got the same pair and his broke about 2 months later
3,Great sound quality but it will break eventually!!!,"I am on my 3rd replacement set of headphones, keep calling logitech and complaining, get a new pair, crack, break,.... but now they are discontinued. This time I taped up the center portion for reinforcement and the headband still wore out. The problem is there is a small divit in the middle of the band that is basically a weak spot and it always cracks on that spot. I don't understand why they cant fix this in the manuf. process! Other than that these are the best wireless headphones on the planet."
1,Do not buy this product...,"Hi,I bought this for Christmas for my son and within a month the headband cracked. Even though Amazon promises to return gifts bought during the christmas time the company that shipped it only does 30 days and since I bought it for christmas the 30 days expired before January 31st.I am going to try to get Logitech to replace the headphones since this appears to be a common problem for this product.I will no longer buy gifts via Amazon for Christmas. Learned my lesson about the way the return policy is printed."
2,Badly made product,"I received this headset for Christmas, and it worked great. At first. Recently I lost all sound in the left ear. I've never abused either the headphones or the receiver in any way. For some reason the receiver's wiring is loose, and shouldn't be so soon after owning this product. I think it has to do with the moveable connector (I have to move it when connecting it to the earphone port on my computer, then back when connecting it to my Zen MP3 player)."
1,25% failure rate.,"Here's the bottom line - in burning 15 copies of a DVD on my computer, I had 5 Playo discs fail. That's a 25% failure rate. I've never had that kind of failure rate with Memorex or Philips discs."
4,Wonderful reading !,"After reading through various titles on Science, Consciousness and philosphy, I came across this title. I was initially apprehensive about one more title. Should I read or not! .But well I am glad that I did. Never seen a better handling of topic in a simple narrative form.I recommend this book but little caution that the person should have a little context on this subject."
4,Good But Repetitive Intro to Consciousness,"This book offers an interesting perspective on the topic of consciousness for someone who understands the basics but does not have a sustained, in-depth knowledge of the various theories. It does a good job of presenting Flanagan's own neurophilosophical theory while offering discussion of the competition.Flanagan does not answer his dualist critics, such as David Chalmers, at great length. He focuses more on other naturalists.This book is generally a good overview of the topic, though a great deal of the content of this book is contained in Chapter 8 of Flanagan's work ""The Science of the Mind."" That was a disappointment, and due to that and the fact that the discussion could have been a bit more in-depth, the book gets 4 stars and not 5. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in modern theories of consciousness."
2,"Good, not great info, other better resourses available","While the information in the book about herbs is useful, there are better books available that don't make claims of being able to cure HCV. The author reprinted his lab results for blood tests and used his liver enzyme levels as proof. However he did not show us his viral load and antibody test results which is what actually determines the presence of the virus. From experience I know that the herbs this author recommends do help the liver to function better as I have been able to get my enzyme levels back into the normal range with the same herbs, however I still have the HCV antibodies and a high viral load. I am not cured. I might be compelled to try the author's high-priced frozen vials of magic if I saw proof that people were clearing the virus. But none was offered. I thought the author wrote this book with a very angry tone and that the homophobia, sexism and racism was unnecessary and really turned me off."
1,Who are these actors and WHY did they make this movie?,I compare this movie to it's most memorable scene....A zit being squeezed off the back of an out-of-shape hitchhiker....Don't pick it up and don't hope to get anything out of it!
4,Quite a trip,"Wow, there are parts of this movie where you feel like you have to be high in order to enjoy it or ""get"" it. The majority of this movie is really cute. I wouldn't say this is gut busting funny, but it still gets a laugh out of me."
5,The Mighty Crain,"Arguably the best album from one of the best indie bands to come out of Louisville. Powerful and innovative. Also check out the Speed LP, if you're lucky enough to locate it."
1,A Waste of Time,"This book is throughly disgusting. How many times will this story be written? I didn't care for the portral of the characters, or the whole story. I started a few chapters, and skipped through most of the book until the end. There still wasn't anything there to be worth while. The author took too long to write this book, or maybe should have taken longer. I apprecaite reading these reviews. At the time I purchased this book, there weren't many reviews to judge it. The reviews will now save me from wasting money on purchasing certain books, even through I have an extensive Sherlock Holmes collection. I also realize characters die in mysteries, but children?I agree with one of reviews, this books should be trashed."
2,Window kit,Make sure you only put this in once because if you're not carefully you will brake the tabs off that hold it in. If you get it right the first time it looks nice.
2,Not good...,"OK, there isn't much about this item that rates much above a C- in terms of ease of use, overall looks, and durability. For one, the clips are worthless. The slots on them by just looking at them are so tight they are going to snap off when I try to put the thing on. Two, the directions are worthless. There is NOTHING telling you what to do, just some pictures that do not address the proper way to cut the hole through the plastic case AND the metal liner in the Xbox, unless I missed something. Three--mine came broken/chipped up so I immediately just sent it back five seconds after excitedly opening it. BLAH, what a bummer. Thing is, after drilling a hole in my case to get started with the hole for the window, now what do I do? I guess I will buy one and try it again, hopefully the last one was a fluke as far as being chipped up and having the clips all fall off before I even got started with it."
2,Be very cautious to whom you give this book,"Frankly, I can't see what most folks are seeing in this book. I am a Buddhist and I found this to be one of the bleakest descriptions of Buddhist thinking that I have read. Understanding the Buddhist philosophy, I understand what the author is trying to say is ""let go and live in the moment"" and I can squeeze some useful information out of the text. But the negative way in which this is stated could be discouraging to those considering a Buddhist path, and dangerous for the very depressed. ""There is no hope; there is nothing for you; there is nothing to lean on, only cold loneliness.""""Expectation"" is what causes suffering, not hope. If I had no hope that my life could improve, that man could find peace, I would not waste my time with Buddhism or meditation. I simply do not let any expectation about it arise that can give rise to disappointment. The best stuff in this book is about bodhichitta and patience."
4,"Perfect, short chapters - easy to read in sections!","This book is so full of beautifully worded advice, using stories from the author's life and is comprised of short chapters, so it's perfect to read one ""lesson"" and wait to absorb it before reading on. It's great bedtime reading...and the lessons are so rich, yet the author makes them seem possible to include in daily life."
5,A Must Have for Any Library,"Pema Chodron's book is important as a tool for learning how to 'be happy where you are' - no matter whether its a good day or a day in which we experience those feelings like the world is going to end. Written in short sections with a clear focus on key points. I have marked up and put post-its throughout this book and go back to it, chapter-by-chapter, regularly to remind myself of its key lessons."
5,When things fall apart,"Loving it, it's kind hard to understand but really a good book to practice in when things sre not much in your favor...read it!"
1,Depressing book,"I picked up this book thinking that it would be give some perspective and clarity on how to deal with life events in a measured way. But the book keeps on going on and on about giving up hope for anything, take things the way they are, it feels as it is preaching inaction. Also the author talks about things like ""compassion"", loving yourself, etc, etc , but doesn't really explain how to achieve these through buddhist practice, or what exactly ""compassion"" means. I think this is an overloaded word that before being used, it needs to be explained. My take on this book after reading half of it is that she is saying, life is terrible, give up on hope because nothing will change, enjoying anything that life has to give is deluding yourself, etc. So, it sounds to me that this book is saying you are in this world to suffer, and the quicker you admit that the better."
3,Pema speaks to your soul...,I listened to the tapes for a couple of days and went back and listened again to them... The second time allowed me to digest Pema's ideas and thoughts concerning our world and everyday lives.. This is great if your in a transitional place and want to be inspired...
1,do not read this book if you are suicidal.,"This book asks the impossible of anyone who is clinically depressed: to find joy in despair. If you are a healthy, functioning adult, you may be able to ""move into the fear"" and ""totally experience hopelessness, giving up all alternatives to the present moment,"" but if you are truly in despair, you may just take the final, obvious, inevitable step. I found this book self-satisfied, self-promoting, and pedantic."
1,Meditation,This book is not for me. There are quite a few references to Rinpoche's and it seems to repeat alot of the same messages.
5,A must-read for anyone going through any kind of crisis,"Thank you Pema Chodron for sharing this simple and accessible wisdom and experience. In a down-to-earth, non-preachy manner, Pema outlines the Buddhist approach to handling crisis, pain and chaos."
4,Heart Advice for ANY time!,This is the first time I have read any book on Bhuddist philosophy. I was quickly drawn in by Ms. Chodron's humor and candor about her own life. Everyone can find something in their lives that relates to this book. Reading a chapter a night was calming and centering. Great
5,When things fall apart,"Absolutely inspiring! Buddhist wisdom for every day life, has very practical advise. Very basic and easy to understand even for non-buddhists. Title might trick you into thinking it is a book to help you deal with depression or hard times, but it is actually for every day life. To help deal with the most simple to more complex realities, both good and not so good situations life can bring. Heart warming book!"
4,Nice book,"This is a nice book for anyone, not just for those who feel that things are falling apart. It offers insight into accepting life just as it is, in this moment. The author shares her 'wisdom mind' in this concise and compassionate book about finding peace within the fundamental groundlessness of life. I also highly recommend a book of Eastern wisdom titled ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" by Taro Gold. I have found great wisdom in both these books."
5,Incredible Insight,"Chodron has distilled down some basic Buddhist themes for dealing with times when things seemingly 'fall apart'. For people in these stages of life, the book is a short, powerful way to focus attention on the illusions of 'security' most of us try to build into our lives (job, family, marriage). When one or more of these things are stripped from us, we feel a bit like we're dying.Instead, she shows how these times can be building blocks for true contentment by discarding the over dependence on 'things' or 'people' as your foundation for happiness.If you're not in a crisis, the book may appear somewhat breezy and shallow. However, in these economic times I find a lot of people reaching out for works like Chodron's as they try to put thier lives ona new footing."
3,Decent,Overall the book was a bit boring to read. Lots of Buddhist references that you must know to make the reading meaningful. 75% of the way through I started skimming. There were some really great concepts but because they were rooted in a basic Buddhist lesson you could get that from anywhere. I would not recommend this to someone who is divorcing.
5,Always learning,One of the best she has written. No matter when you read this or what is going on in your life this will help you make the most of it.
5,Very Enlightening,I am learning a lot from this book! It's definitely worth the money if you want to be more peaceful inside. It starts out kind of slowly but gets better and better.
1,"Dont read this if you are unhappy, depressed etc.","This is book presents some unusual ideas, but does NOT help you or teach you how to look at things in a more constructive or positive way or to guide you how to hadle the crisis in hand.DONT read this book if you are unhappy or depressed as this book will just make things worse, or at least look worse.P."
2,OVERATED and MIND NUMBINGLY BORING,I do not understand the fascination with Pema Chodron's works. Her voice sounds like somenoe who has never known a day of joy in her life. She is extremely repressed sounding and sucks the life out of LIFE. I felt like I was chocking on cardboard listening to her. While I agree with her that we shouldn't contine to believe that we can creat a permanence to our lives her way is just as devoid of seeing the truth. Lovingkindness and Compassion are what makes life worthwhile but I felt like my mind was being dragged over cement listening to how she thought we should go about accomplishing this. There are plenty of teachers who are better such as Jack Kornfield or Sharon Salzburg who seem to convey some of these ideas in a way that feels compassionate. I think Pema just has catchy titles for her books. She also offers no reasonable way to live out these teachings in a way that works towards peace or the caretaking of our planet.
2,I should have read the book.,"I kept trying over and over to get through just 15mn. of this CD (Auidobook) but every time I would drift away into doing something else, all I ever heard was a woman talking and talking and talking, and not really saying anything at all. I was waiting for something magical but it just never came. I think there's some wisdom in there some where, I just couldn't find it."
1,Waste of money; new age clap-trap,This book is a confused conglomeration of new-age clap trap. This might be OK for people who have a totally subjective view of reality - Pretty sure there are some of those folks out there. In short -- waste of money.
3,Not for the Weak of Heart,"My therapist recommended that I read this book. Did she forget the reason I began to see her? If you're looking for encouragement or hope this book is not, and I repeat NOT for you. However, if you are a realist or want the hard truth you'll find it here."
5,A great book by Pema Chodron,"This book was recommended to me by my therapist. It teaches incredible bravery in facing your fears and allowing yourself to be vulnerable. At the time I read it, I was not a Buddhist, and found it very helpful. Now, I've gone on to become a Buddhist. For the beginner or the advanced, this book offers so much."
5,Wonderful,"I LOVE this book. I have read it four times. It truly speaks to my heart. This books speaks of mindfulness, loving-kindness, compassion, and many other spiritual ideas in a way that I have never understood - or that I finally and actually heard and now understand through Pema Chodron's words. I highly recommend this book for those on a spiritual path. It truly makes me think deeper with each reading. I am awake, conscious, and aware. Thank you to Pema Chodron for her part in my spiritual awakening. I am filled with the light of truth in every moment."
4,"When times are difficult...read this book, it's very inspiring.",Good read when you think you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel! And it was so easy to get it through my Kindle!
3,refreshing,He has the potential to go far. With the right publicity this can be achieved. I wish him luck.
2,"It works, sometimes...","This product seems to do as it purports, automatically wind a watch, but it also seems to have some problems. It runs (very quietly) for a while, but then it mysteriously stops and sits there with the little blue LED blinking away. This behavior is not documented in the user guide and is not consistent with the programs as they are explained in the user guide, so I don't know what's going on, and there seems to be no source of technical support. I don't think it's really worth the amount that they want for it, it's clear that someone is making a hefty amount of profit on this little baby, but, on the other hand, it's quiet, good-looking and sometimes actually does it's job."
3,"Great music, but a disappointing product","I bought this CD partly on the strength of the Rough Guide review that described it as a compilation of ""full-length"" versions. Although it's a very well-chosen collection of songs, it's not true that all the tracks are full-length: at least two definitely aren't. I'm speaking of ""Spill the Wine"" (in which the second verse is completely omitted) and ""The World Is a Ghetto"" (which is nowhere near the length of the original album version). It's especially a shame because it's such a great-looking package and there is surely plenty of room on a two-disc set for the full-length versions."
5,Very Essential,War is One Of The Baddest All-Around Groups ever.this Double Set Showcases their Great Talent.War is Long Over-Due for their Props.the Grooves Never Let up.Their Music has so Many Different Styles.They Asked a Very Human Question here Why Can't We Be Friends?Very Powerful&Uplifting.Great Music.
4,"Some beautiful passages, but...","There are many lyrical passages here that are truly lovely and memorable.I wouldn't recommend this as your only collection of Meera poems, tho.Half way through, her endless complaining gets old.Other translations are kinder."
5,Romantic tunes at their best,"Citing from Gramophone's review ""Temirkanov's luscious, almost lascivious treatment of the big tunes will no doubt appeal to many"" I can state nothing else but ""That's exactly what I seek and profoundly enjoy when listening to this wonderful piece of music!"". Close your eyes and experience all the pictures, scenes, sequences, imaginations that arise by the great romantic tunes which are part of this symphony. Also Sound quality (20-bit-recording) is impeccable, to my mind."
3,"Great Product, Bad Delivery","Amy's Chili gets 5 stars from me for quality - it's fantastic and is the only canned chili I will eat. The non-lite version is slightly better but this is quality in it's own right. The consistency is good and the spice is acceptable to me (I add more) but not too much for people who prefer a milder flavor. EXCELLENT product.Sadly, Amazon's delivery of this product is sub-par. ONLY order it alone. If you subscribe and save multiple items they will bundle this into a large box and you will end up with 12 out of 12 badly dented cans (which may or may not be safe to eat - I personally wouldn't risk it). I've gotten several boxes, but they were all single orders. Lesson? Pay the extra $3 or whatever and order this separately and NOT on the subscribe and save plan.Or just go to your local store and buy it."
4,Good and HOT,Love this as a back up or over rice. Amy's is the best and can be counted on for consistency in flavor and quality. It is gluten free as well and that is worth a lot when you are trying to meet the needs of a person who has this problem.
2,Not Impressive,I was not impressed at all by this book. All the Maine references were a bit heavyhanded. I felt like I was reading an advertisement at times. Half-way through I was ready to give up on it but the writing was passable so I finished it. Nothing memorable here.
1,Air Disasters,"Definately not the best aviation disaster book I have read. The authors seem to lack alot of aeronautical knowledge and for some reason they do not refrence all of the places they received information.It is not the worst book I have ever read, However, I would recommend ""The Black Box"" by Malcom MacPherson. For a couple more bucks you will get 10 times the book."
2,POINTLESS BOOK,"Relating briefly 50 air crashes is not the best way to write a book about this relevant subject. Some of the accidentes described contains only ten or so lines in total !!!. Anyway, it gives a good general introduction to the naive person in this fascinating, dramatic and morbid subject. If you wanna really know about air crashes, then stick to MacArthur Job's series ( three volumes ) AIR DISASTER."
3,ARTISTIC LOOK AT AIR DISASTERS,"As with the companion book on Shipwrecks (Eastlake), this is not the place to go for extensive factual information. Each disaster is described in a page at most, and no effort is made to explain the causes or after effects of the accidents. The book's value lies in its artistic layout. Every calamity is well illustrated, either with paintings or photos, and the chapters are organized by cause (weather, collision, etc.) Readers might look at this book as a supplement to others in their collection. Not a great read, but worth having on the shelf."
3,Tenerife,"In regard to the previous review, I didn't see in the Tenerife accident any reference to any year other than 1977, the correct date. I would be interested, however, to know where the authors found their information on this accident, as the Canary Islands are a Spanish possession and the NTSB did not issue a report. I would be interested in finding an NTSB-type report on this accident, as this book did sensationalize it some (the Fairchild FH-227 crash in Chile was sensationalized excessively, taking more time to describe the death and injuries than it did to describe the technical points of the crash), and I'm needing something a bit more formal for Tenerife."
5,U.S. Chaos heavies out Exploited Tribute,"This comp was on our watch list and so is U.S. Chaos, this track USA was one of the most powerfull songs in my eyes, growing up in England during 1982 and brings back the real meaning of high powered punk. I always wondered what happened to U.S. Chaos. Well I guess they have refined their sound to be even more powerfull then when I saw them so long ago. CUDOS! Keep it up guys, we will meet soon on contract terms in a studio! Mr. Munsch treats you well."
5,WOW,"This is definately the best album I have ever heard. Bands like blanks 77 and us chaos took songs that I didn't think could get any better and actually improved them but keeping the original spirit of the exxploited. I never imagined this album would be this good. I said it before and I'll say it again this is the best album I have ever heard. This album is great for fans of oi,hardcore,oldschool, classic rock, pop punk, even metal. this album has something for everyone I garontee you if you don't buy this your missing out."
2,Sounds like Savage Garden,"Ok, I don't own this album. I just listen to the samples here on amazon. The only thing i have to say is that when i had look to the section "" Customer who bought this album also bought..."" and that these other bands were really great bands, i really didn't expect THIS! Seriously, me and my girl friend thought that it sound a bit like Savage Garden especially on track 4, and for me it's a big turn off. I don't know why people who like Martyr and Frantik Bleep especially could love this band. Their is nothing related."
5,Practical Praying,I was anxious to receive this book. I wanted to see what John thought about the Rosary. I wanted to see how his thoughts differed from mine.I was not disappointed.It is a beautiful book and CD.I would reccommend it to anyone who wants to see / hear another version of the rosary and how to pray.
4,"Short, Simple, Effective","For those who use a rosary, this might be a bit of a different perspective, but I think it's mainly for those who don't, but might want to incorporate a different type of prayer in their spiritual life. I enjoyed finding out more about John Edward..."
2,Not what I expected...,"I liked the idea of John Edward writing about the rosary - especially to non-catholics b/c many miss the beautiful prayer that it the rosary. The background info on the origins of the rosary was simple and precise to those unfamiliar with it. The section on expanding one's prayer life was also a great way for anyone to work on one's prayer life.However, John Edward constantly writes about how he is not preaching Catholicism and he is ""not on the Vatican payroll."" While I understand he does not want to offend some of his non-catholic followers, it really was tiresome for this Catholic to constantly read about. The constant onslaught of ""I'm catholic, but I don't believe in everything catholic, and I am not preaching catholicism to you"" overall turned me off the book.The best thing to do is to go directly to the sections that deal with the rosary (historically and spiritually) and how to develop a prayer life based off of the rosary."
2,PRACTICAL PRAYING,"I WAS EXPECTING MORE FROM JOHN EDWARDS. THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF REPITITION, AND TO LIFE LONG CATHOLICS IT WAS LIKE GOING TO GRADE SCHOOL"
1,Yuck!,"I was sorely disapointed with this book and I'd return it if I could. Even though John Edward denies this book isn't solely for Catholics... WRONG! It's everything he denies it is, and if you are a non-Catholic or even non-Christian, you will definitely not appreciate this book. Filled with stereotypical Catholic drama with a dash of New Age. Not at all what I expected. I really enjoyed Edward's other books. A New Age tribute to the Catholic Goddess. Too bad for his many fans who aren't Catholic or Christian."
1,Exploiting grief then prayer....,"Rather than addressing the four year backlog of grieving people waiting for readings from him, John Edward has chosen to write and promote this new book. Since the mediumship gig no longer is lucrative, he has apparently turned into a quasi-religious guru, exhorting people to find happiness and meaning through praying the rosary. Underneath the claimed spirituality and compassion, this book is crass and distasteful. I used to be a fan--before his self-promotion and lack of sincere concern for the people he markets to became so obvious. Now?...Definitely money could be better spent elsewhere. I have his other books (and audio/video tapes, and a DVD), but I now feel that making a contribution to a charity would be a more satisfying spiritual act than buying this new book."
2,Retitled But Same Stuff,"I was very disappointed in this book. The first half of the book was almost a verbatim reproduction of The Peacemaker. The second half of the book is a repeat of the initial repeat in the first half of the book but directed at dealing with children. There is no new information simply a change in wording that says the samething Ken Sande said in the Peacemaker and also in the first half of this book. The only hope for this book were the last two chapters that dealt with when your marriage gets in trouble and steps to protect your marriage. Both chapters were very vague and not very helpful. The author did say it was not his purpose to deal with marriage. However, my question is if that was not his intention why did he include a whole chapter on it? My recommendation is buy The Peacemaker and you do not need to waste your money on this book. It promises much and delivers very little."
3,"Same concepts as The Peacemaker, with less detail","I borrowed this book from the library, expecting it to be filled with practical applications of Ken Sande's original ""The Peacemaker"" resource. I was disappointed to see that it contains the key concepts from the original book, with lesser detail, and only brief applications to marriage and children. If what you are looking for is a synopsis of ""The Peacemaker"" specifically directed at the area of family conflict, then it is a good read. However, if you are looking to apply the conflict resolution methods more broadly, and desire a more in-depth explanation, then read the original. It goes into the concepts of conflict resolution (slippery slope, the 4 G's, 7 A's to confession, PAUSE) in greater detail and the reflection questions are thoughtful and pointed."
4,Excellent reference VHS from an excellent musician.,"What I liked about this VHS is that it came with a small page of rhythm transcriptions that is actually jammed packed with information. It's great to see one of my favorite drummers in action, and the combination of being able to see the bass drum work (in a cut out) as well as the remainder of the kit is valuable. I rated this 4 stars only because I thought more could have been offered in other areas, mainly the production. Jeff burps a few times during the VHS, which is something I though could have been avoided. Other than that, he's still one of my favorites."
2,Get J.D. Salinger instead,"The Wynona Riders have a few good songs, and that's it... nearly all of them are on their EP with Lookout! records, but there's a couple more that are only found on their full-lengths or on compliations. You'd be doing fine with the EP, but if you want more then get J.D. Salinger. The recording quality is just a ton better... I think this is supposed to be a live album or something but it's not advertised as such. Unless you are excited to own a live version of the songs, avoid this... it just doesn't sound so great on the stereo.You have to sift through some silly garbage to get to the songs that make the Wynona Riders worth owning, on either full-length. For example they cover the friggin Power Rangers song... now why would they go and do that? There's more on this album that might be funny once, but the rest of the time you just keep hitting that ""next"" button on the CD remote, and it just makes the album get less and less play in my rotation."
3,"OK, But Perhaps Not as Great as the Others","Pound for pound, this collection seems to contain more poems by less famous poets than the other seasonal books in this collection, which is great, but many of these poems seem to have somewhat similar themes (a LOT of poems that mention leaves--perhaps a world record for a collection) and like another reviewer here, I have to agree that this book is a little more dull than the others. However, it's pretty good, and certainly warrants at least three stars."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?!?!,"Unlike the two previous volumes on spring and winter, THE HEART OF AUTUMN is extremely dull and dim. What happened? The cover is attractive, I like the idea of the leaf ""illustrations"", but the poems are not at all stimulating emotionally, nor do they lead the reader to reflection. I do hope, on the other hand, the summer volume will make up for this poor selection made for autumn--in fact, could I ask for a revised edition of the autumn volume (there have to be better poems that this...) of it instead of asking for my money back?"
4,Lost words that should be found.,"Jeffrey Kacirk, The Word Museum: The Most Remarkable English Words Ever Forgotten (Simon and Schuster, 2000)A small, yet wonderful, dictionary of words that, for the most part, are no longer in use and probably should be. Other reviewers have pointed out that Kacirk could have done more with this, and they're correct, but I had no problems at all with what's here. The only real expectations I had coming into this were that I'd get the words and find out what they meant, and that's exactly what I got. It's better than your thesaurus. You need it. ****"
4,A word for every occasion,"This book is a treasure trove for those of us interested in the obscure.Even 'grammar-folk' (educated people) will be 'blutterbunged' (confounded, overcome by surprise).Highly recommended for those of us who love what is obscure.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
5,"The Cultivation of Hemp: Botany, Varieties, Cultivation and Harvesting","This is the seminal work of its kind to the farming of industrial hemp. As the long and ridiculous prohibition on growing industrial hemp in the United States comes to an end, most of our wannabe hemp farmers will need and find this information most helpful since so much about hemp farming has been lost during the ban. As more people realize the value of hemp to our farming, manufacturing and retail economies, the more they will need to know about it in order to maximize their efforts and outcomes. This is well written and easy to read; a no nonsense text crammed full of what we need to know about hemp farming and processing. Though highly recommended by VoteHemp, it is out of print. I am grateful to have found it available through a seller at Amazon for a reasonable price."
3,ummmmmm,Interesting at times.....more like a documentry then a story....redunant at times.Just did not quite peak interest took an effort to read!
5,Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln,Many details and explanations of conclusions drawn. Very detailed accounts of many of the players.Much research must have gone into this book.
2,Reads like a long term paper,"Steers provides loads of sources and references for his work, but it sure is not very fun to read. The irksome thing about this book is that Steers is so impolitely insulting to any historian who he disagrees with. Wouldn't it be more professional to simply cite a source refuting another's theory? Calling other historians names for drawing differing conclusions just seems bombastic, not scholarly. This book does not give any feel of the time period at the end of the civil war. For pleasure reading, I found books by Swanson, Shaara, Bill O'Reilly and Shelby Foote much more readable and not so harsh to other students of Civil War History."
5,A MUST FOR YOUR LINCOLN BOOKSHELF!,"This book was obviously well researched. Steers fluently documents the series of events surrounding the Lincoln assasination. His telling of events is easy to follow. After reading this book, I have a better understanding of the people involved in the conspiracy and the roles they played in carrying out this tragic event in American history. This is definitely a book you want to buy for your Lincoln bookshelf. Steers paints a clear picture of the Lincoln assasination, however for a truly enjoyable companion read, I would suggest ""Lincoln Assasination"" by Swanson and Weinberg. The high quality photos in the Swanson/Weinberg book enhance your undersatnding of the events told by Steers. The two books bring the story to life!"
5,would buy from again,I received my book very quickly and the book is in excellent shape. I would buy from this person again.
1,Moon ?????,Nothing in this book that I did not already know about one of the greatest men who ever lived.The title still mystifies me.The style of writing is poor - the author does not know how to connect with the reader. He also takes some cheap shots at other authors - Dont throw stones Mr. Steers!If anyone wants to know about this terrible time - read MANHUNT by James SwansonJohn Lawlor
5,Blood on the Moon--Fascinating Read!,"Kudos to Mr. Steers for writing a well-docmuented historical account that reads like a nightmarish novel. For anyone with an interest in the US Civil War era or President Lincoln, I would rate this book as a ""must have."" The book has a fascinating account of the assassination conspiracy; the length (over time) of the conspiracy and the direct involvement of the Confederate government in the conspiracy were surprises. Whenever Steers makes assumptions, he plainly states the bases for those assumptions; and, they make sense given the materials he cites. I did wind up wanting to know more about the Confederate Secret Service and its Union counterpart; and, more about their roles in the Civil War generally. Treatment of this subject in Steers' book was more than adequate for the topic of Steers' book, though. Very enjoyable (allowing for the overwhelming sadness of the topic) and informative reading!"
4,Kindle Edition could use improvement,"I bought the Kindle edition of this book and as with all the Kindle editions I've purchased, I am always disappointed with the way graphic images are handled.In this book, the graphics are especially poor. My major complaint is that the resolution is so low, that when you tap on a thumbnail image to enlarge it, the full sized image is fuzzy and illegible. This was especially frustrating when trying to read the map of Booth's escape route from Washington.I viewed the Kindle edition on several different devices - iPad mini, Kindle Fire, an Android phone, an Android tablet, and a PC laptop with a 17"" screen. The display of graphics improved with increased screen size, but that really defeats the purpose of buying a true Kindle device in the first place - small format, high resolution, portability.As a read however, I thought this book was outstanding. It was informative and engaging. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the disappointing graphics."
4,A great read about the Lincoln assassination,"This is a excellent account of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. It includes events leading up to the assassination, the paths of the conspirators before and after, and the protracted search for John Wilkes Booth. Mr. Steers is a nationally known Lincoln scholar and writer. His extensive research and knowledge into this subject have landed him on network television and radio, and in the audience of sitting Presidents. Blood on the Moon is written in a lively style that will keep you riveted to you seat, even though you know the final outcome. A must read for any history buff. A great read for anyone."
4,Minka Air Ceiling Fan Light,"The light matches our ceiling fan perfectly. However, we have a fairly large bedroom so it doesn't produce as much light as we had hoped. Nevertheless, it was worth the price."
4,A fabulous performance,"After seeing it live in person, I wasn't sure if the cameras could capture the raw emotion and incredible talent on stage. They did, and now you can experience it, too. I think this version is much more accessible than the John Doyle production (available at Amazon or on Netflix), which will hopefully lead to more fans of Sondheim and this show."
4,Another Sondheim star,"I am not a big fan of ""Company,"" nor am I an unabashed fan of composer Stephen Sondheim. I recognize him as a genius of the musical theater and that his innovative narratives and shows have transformed Broadway in many ways. I also recognize that Sondheim's music is superb, that his songs are truly classics of the Broadway stage. But, I also think that his stories and settings let him down, and frankly, ""Company"" is a downer for me. Perhaps it is the theme, pehaps it is simply because I had to review two separate college casts of the production for a newspaper chain I worked for. Though the casts were solid, and the direction splendid, back-to-back productions on successive nights were too much to digest. I admit I like the music, I also admit that I don't like the book. This prodution is very good, so I give it four stars for the production and the music alone. Forget the book."
1,Beware,"To all customers, I discovered, to my dissatisfaction, that this disc will not play in region 4! There is no indication that I can see which might have saved me the expense."
3,be aware,"Company (Stephen Sondheim) [Blu-ray] i was so looking forward to this dvd, but when it arrived i found that it would not play on our system down here in australia, so i now will wait till i can find a blue ray player that is able to play it, it seems strange that this is the only blue ray dvd that i have recived from amazon that dosn't work on the system down under, so i will write a review when i'm able to watch it. JUST BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU BUY THAT IT CAN PLAY ON YOUR SYSTEM, THIS BLUE RAY HAD NO NOTICE ON ITS COVER ABOUT THAT."
3,Quick-cut editing,"I saw this when it came out in the theaters for a limited run about a year ago. My enjoyment of this production was dampened by the rapid-cut editing style, more appropriate for a Michael Bay action movie than a live theatrical production. It was bad enough that in certain places it made me nauseous. The voices are great, the acting is great; Colbert gives a surprisingly restrained and touching performance. NPH is great as always. But I don't think I could watch it again; how about a soundtrack recording?"
5,BRAVO !!!!!!!!!,"Get this Blu Ray if you love the American musical theater and Stephen Sondheim. I was more than annoyed by the stripped downRaul Esparza production ... skimpy and dull, despite some great voices. Now we have a COMPANY for the ages with the full orchestrations,wonderful cast and a feeling that you are there in Avery Fisher Hall. I found myself applauding numbers as if I were there with the audience.Sound mix is superb. The clarity of the Blu Ray is astonishing. This disc is a must have."
5,excellent,"While the story is a little dated, the performances are very good. Can't quibble the the NYP for a pit orchestra, or Patti Lupone or Neil Patrick Harris."
5,Tough Boys Rule!,"This is a book like no other I have ever read. I never dreamed that we, the people of the United States, dealt with things like vote-buying and curruption that was out-in-the-open. This author writes with great color and paints a vivid story with a bright pallet. He describes a time and place that no longer exists as it once was -- a bustling coal town called Logan, in West Virginia. And these ""Tough Boys"" are ornery mountain politicians who get away with everything as slick-as-a-ribbon. It's fun to read, especially because it's all true. Plus, here's the kicker: John Kennedy was even involved in the underhanded world of half-pints of liquor for votes, and cash palmed for favors. YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!"
5,This is a great read! I couldn't put it down!,"If you like real history and a behind the scenes look at the dark side of mountain politics, this book is for you. I found it extremely humorous at times and seriously frank about the vote-buying antics of certain political faction bosses of yesteryear. This author has researched the way politics -- down and dirty politics -- used to be, and still may be today in some regions. Moonshine for liquor, palming cash for power, and giving political jobs as favors: it's all told in this great read. The Kennedys were even involved! Bravo! This book is first class and should be in every school library."
2,Too Little Politics/Too Much Bio,"A little bio on Raymond Chafin would have been helpful. Unfortunately, biographic nuances overwhelm what the reader, enticed by the title, is likely seeking. How Mr. Chafin courted his wife, swept the company store, and spent his retirement in Florida, are not what I had hoped for. Other contemporary bosses are given short shrift, to say the least. As to coverage of how the elections in Logan County are won in the trenches?....not much. Quite a disappointment."
1,A Flash in the pan,This book is badly written and poorly organized. Many of the tutorials don't work-like making a mask using an invisible button. Important steps are left out so the technique will only work if you do some major debugging. Unfortunately this book does not give enough basic information to enable you to figure out the missing information.
2,Missing important steps!,"Try to stay away from purchasing this book. The tutorials provided go along and skip over vital steps in the process of completing the tutorial, as if you are supposed to already know the in between steps. Me being a beginner with Flash, skipping over these steps in most of the tutorials left me sitting and wondering what I had missed. But going back and reading, I never did skip over anything... there were just steps missing in the text! Very Frustrating!! And the book's chapters are not ordered in the way that I would have like to have seen them. By the first few chapters, you are already doing action scripting. Not good if you're just starting with Flash."
5,PEACOCK SPLENDOR,The color of the shawl matchs the color of an actual peacock beautifully. The blue is so vibrant. The peacock lays perfectly across the back.
2,Not the Body Shop cloths,"I'd hoped it was the same as I used to buy from the Body Shop, but it's not. It's OK, but the weave is much looser and it's scratchier."
3,Getting old is great--if you're cheese!,"A funny but rather one-sided look at the changes that accruefrom aging. For a completely balanced view, you might want to pairthis book with ""Getting Old Sucks."" Do not go gently into that good night!"
5,purchase,Very happy with purchase. Service was very good when we had a question. Let us return a item that didn't work for our set up
2,Calling 9-1-1 Sounds an Audible Alarm On All New Verizon Phones,"All new Verizon phones sound an alarm when the user calls 9-1-1. Although not all Verizon representatives know about the alarm, all of Verizon's new phones have it.This is an awful feature. Think of a student at Columbine or Virginia Tech hiding from the gunman in a closet and trying to quietly call 9-1-1 to get help. Or imagine someone at home in bed who hears a burglar break the window downstairs. Quickly they reach for their cell phone to call 9-1-1. The last thing someone needs at that moment is a loud alarm going off when they hit send.Not all cell phone services have 9-1-1 alarms on their phones. If you plan to use your cell phone when you feel threatened, you might want to consider going with another carrier."
5,High time there's been a truly funny and well-acted romance flick!,"I just loved this movie. It had an interesting, rather novel storyline to back up the romance and, fortunately, very good actors that carry the story. Rent it, buy it, watch it! (I also fell in love with one of the groups that sings one of the songs in the movie -- check out ""The 88"".)"
4,Great first 2/3rds,"Pretty far into this film I was thinking, ""wow, this is a great movie!"" and planning on giving it 5 stars. Unfotunately, instead of just focussing on the main couple, the last third or so really drags by bringing in in-laws, exes, blah blah, just too much. There are several weddings in the movie and I would have ended it at the second (not to give anything away).But I'm still going to give it 4 stars for originality, a GREAT cast, being overall entertaining, and being smarter than the average romantic comedy."
4,Awesome Turner,"The is only the second Henckels kitchen tool I've bought, the other being a peeler. The quality is excellent - both the handle and the turner aparatus are of high grade materials. The face is easy to clean unlike the turners with holes that constantly get food stuck in them. Also, the tool is dishwasher safe, so cleaning is that much easier.There are two improvements that I ""wish"" for: make the face a little wider and give it a straight front edge. Last night I made scrambled eggs and it was awkward trying to scrape the eggs with the angled front edge. Overall, Henckels has done a great job with this little turner - you'll enjoy it!"
2,This may not be the book you want,"When I ordered this book I didn't realize what it was. I thought it was going to tell me about the contents of the Dead Sea Scrolls. No, it isn't that kind of book. I wouldn't have ordered it had I known what it was.It is more about the discovery of the scrolls, the caves, etc.So let this review be a warning to a prospective buyer. If what you are interested in is simply to learn the stories contained in the scrolls, read some of the other reviews to find out where that information can best be found. Not here.Anyone who gives this review a negative rating doesn't understand the process. This review is exactly the kind of information I could have used before I bought the book.Get the right tool for the job. If you need a Phillips head screwdriver get a Phillips head screwdriver. If you are looking for a book that concentrates on the stories contained in the Dead Sea Scrolls, get one. It's not this."
2,No difference,"I don't know if I just have really, really hard water so anything I try is useless, but this made absolutely no difference in leaving less deposits on my dishes."
5,availability for Jet Dry solids,I simply can't find this product in stores anymore and feel it works better than all the liquid ones. I don't know if they even still make it! I think its a good product and I'm happy there was a seller out there with a supply!
2,Where is the ending?,"Granted he is a fantastic author and I love most of his books, but here, what happened??? The ending is absolutely ludicrous, and totally incoherent. It seems that he was pressured by his publisher on God knows what type of penalty clause, and to comply with the deadline he delivered a badly drafted, and poorly planned final chapters. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because along the book is possible to find some of its effective reflections which are always fun to deal with. He shall use his moral rights to take this book out of circulation forever. What stain on his otherwise wonderful novels."
4,A Remarkable Book!,"Not quite the heavyweight anchor of ""Immortality."" That said, this book is well worth it. Along with ""Slowness"", Kundera originally wrote this in French, not his native Czech like his earlier novels. Provocative in emotion and in thought...."
3,Less than Kundera,"""Identity"", an examination of one woman's sense of self, was not what I had hoped for. I consider myself a Kundera devotee, had I read this book first that might not be so. It's not ""bad"", it's just not all that it good be. I found interesting questions posed, vintage Kundera. However, the ending strikes me as a cheat, as if the publisher's deadline had arrived and Kundera did not know where to take his characters. Therefore, I consider this to be ""Less than Kundera."" It's worth a read, but be prepared for post-readus-frustratus. Alternately, I highly recommend ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being."" A truly beautiful story. It illuminates so much, here-to-fore unthought of. I've read it at least five times. Which in my history, puts it right next to ""Raise High the Roofbeams Carpenters"" and ""Franny and Zoey"" by Salinger.-MA"
3,Good story; fair translation,"While Kundera lives up to his reputation as an artful storyteller, Asher's translation does not do him justice. There are so many moments when you feel the translation....when you are acutely aware that this novel has gone through a mediocre seive. The book empowers the reader to decide the course of the story...a beautiful thing. I only wish I could read French and thus lose the translator's voice."
4,Ode to life!,"Once I started reading this book, I could not let it down. Kundera managed to get us sucked in a labyrinth of emotions and question the very nature of our feelings as well as face our inner demons through the quest of Chantal, a middle-aged woman, for love and the essence of life. As I am going through a tumultuous time on the emotional level, ""Identity"" helped me see that one's identity(ies) and our relation to the identities of others are shaped by confusions of our making and that at the end clarity and salvation come from within."
3,More of the same,"This isn't a bad book. For those unfamiliar with Kundera this is a gentle introduction to the great man, but there is nothing new for his devoteees. We've seen it all before in much better books. His previous novella, Slowness, was more original and challenging. This one is a somewhat misanthropic rehash of all the old themes. He's one of my favourite writers, but he appears to have cut and pasted this novel from material left over from earlier books."
3,WHERE IS THE POETRY and THE POWER of my BEST writer?,"I love Milan Kundera,if I'm now a french writer,it'because,i wanted to xrite as him,with a power of desillusion,a new novel composition,a great poetry.Ah dear Milan,dear master,where is the vigour of your old books?The reading of ""the identity""gave me an unbearable nostalgia on a distant past,an epoch while i lived only for MILAN KUNDERA"
5,Another Masterpiece of Introspection,"This is one of the first novelas Kundera has written in French, and is certainly among the best in his long series of observations of human nature. Although all the novelas exist in the shadow of Kundera's great full length novels, The Unbearable Lightness of Being and Immortality, they are all literary gems well worth reading."
2,Weird,"Who talks like the characters in this book? Are there really people in the world who do? And where are they so I can smack all the self-pity right out of them?!All I could think while I read this book was, ""These people need to get a hobby or something because they have way too much time on their hands."""
3,b-movie of Caesar's gallic war,"This is a fun oldie. The Druids have invented a secret weapon that is supposed to be able to stop and perhaps even destroy Julius Caesar, who must win in order to put down the intrigues against him in Rome. He sends some fanatical warriors to find and destroy it, a desperate gambit that the cautious and analytical Caesar would never have depended on. Along the bloody way, they have a number of adventures (sacrifice, tragedy, cowards, even love). Amazingly, though the Druids invented no such thing, this is not simple superhero stuff, but filled with dark characters and some pretty good suspense. I am sure I saw this when I was a kid, which makes this extra fun. The Romans are kind of the good guys - honorable, brave, and devoted to Caesar - and the Gauls are the cruel savages, but there are many surprises in the characters and their machinations. There is a good finale of battle, and it ends just prior to the battle of Alesia.REcommended as background fun."
1,Don't waste your money,"It is too bad film. Old, old screen .I disapoint very much. I think don't sale this dvd."
4,At the Movies,Galway's second CD in the package was a real bonus. My wife and I enjoyed the professionalism of his music.
4,Not the real Messiah IMO,"This is absolutely wonderful, and I like it, but... as I understand it, this is a 1957 re-orchestration of the original messiah for a full symphony orchestra. It is spectacular, the Hallelujah chorus starts out explosively (a bit too much in fact). It is not the real Messiah in my opinion as the real Messiah is much more delicately performed. I will occasionally listen to this one but will stick with more traditional performances for my main listening. The one exception, is the track ""Thou Shalt Break Them"" in which Beecham's performance is fantastic. But as much as I like this, I push it away for the traditional Messiah. For the same reason I don't even want to hear Mahler's re-orchestration of Beethoven's Ninth."
2,Messiah mistreated,"First of all, there is nothing wrong with the soloist or the rest of the performers of this interpretation of Messiah - in fact, the execution of the work is impeccable. However, it is a performance quite unlike the Messiah intended by Handel. The orchestra has swelled to Wagnerian proportions, even adding instruments like the cymbal, the triangle and tubas, alien and unknown to Handel. It is a Romantic version of a Baroque work. That is potentially interesting. You might expect to gain extra depth, power and grandeur by this, but the overall effect is not good - to tell the truth, the result revolts me! It is like a woman overadorned with jewelry, hiding the natural beauty beneath a veil of vulgarity... This is one historic recording that we don't need."
2,"Good theory, poor practice","The idea of doing Messiah with a Wagnerian orchestra is interesting. But it needs the orchestral genius of a Wagner or Tchaikovsky, and Beecham doesn't have that. It almost seems as if the orchestration is done by a random process. There is no meaning in the changes of color. Whether this is Beecham's fault, or whether it demonstrates that Handel as Wagner doesn't work, will have to be left to a future orchestrator to resolve.Regarding the actual performance, I find it undistiguished. Not the worst (Bonynge gets that title), but not worth a second listen."
3,Zinsco replacement,"I had to return the first one I received since when I installed it, it didn't work. One of the breakers circuit stayed open even though the switch was on. When I installed the first one, it was very difficult to install in slot. The replacement installed easily. I feel the product was not built very well, but it was worth buying since it was less expensive than completely replacing the breaker box. If you have the option and can afford to replace the whole box, it would be worth the trouble."
4,graet item,This breaker saves space in breaker panel by using a narrow profile. This item was not available locally at any store. Beats changing out my entire panel.
4,Best Book on Sheepshead I have Read to Date,"Good book. Useful for beginners and experienced players alike. I have been playing Sheepshead for years and still picked up some good tips for improved play. An easy read to help beginners get started and the point/trump cheatsheet sure beats having to write one out on paper. The information on the history of Sheepshead is a nice touch. Answered some questions I have often wondered about.Would recommend for anyone interested in learing how to play Sheepshead or just looking to improve their game. For the price, it is hard to beat."
1,Out of date and race problems,"I remember reading the Bobbsey Twins books when I was seven, so when I babysat the other night, I was pleased when the seven year old there sat down and started to read this outloud to me. The text itself is just challenging enough for kids of that age, but what I had TOTALLY forgotten about was the whole fact that in the book, while there are black people, they're all household help or holding menial jobs. I'm not black, and I found this all very offputting when I started to re-read the book after the kid had gone to bed. I think it gives a very skewed view of how things were, and certainly of how things are, and I wholeheartedly can't recommend these books to anyone."
5,Bobbsey Twins #1,Our six-year-old grandson loves to have this book series read to him. Now he is learning to read chapter headings and some of the text himself. These books are perfect for stimulating his intellectual side.
4,Good Shape,Finsihed collection books in good shape I reccomend for any little girl's collection... easy riead and stories that engage them
5,I love these curlers!!!,"Growing up on sponge curlers & spiral curlers and the long process of getting ""curls"" I just resorted to using the curling iron as I grew up. Now that I am older and need to get stuff done and can't spend a solid 30 minute curling my long mane so I got these to warm them up, pop them in and do my other thing like make-up and such.These bad boys create a hell of a curl in no time. I love this purchase. Best money I have spent in a long time."
2,Disappointed,I was not pleased with this product. The rollers did not get warm enough to really do anything for your hair.I did like the rollers because they were just the right size and my hair stayed in them well . If they had just heated up more I would have given it least 4 stars. May send mine back.
2,Compact nice looking set; poor performance,Pros:1. Compact size.2. Convenient for travel (only in USA)Cons:1. It takes at least 20 minutes to heat rollers up to the temperature when they start working; still they are never hot enough for good results.2. In addition you have to buy Conair Pro (or Super) Clips to hold rolls firmly. Included clips don't work at all.
5,Travel Smart,Just got these the other day and used them for the first time. This is a great product to travel with and fits into a suitcase or carry one quite easily because it is small and compact yet does a great job. Would not recommend it for anyone with long hair but good for short or medium lenght hair. Also fit great with the Conair hair clips for hot rollers.
4,Great For Traveling !,"Upon recommendation from other consumers, I purchased these rollers. I travel a great deal for my job and get-aways with my husband . The rollers heat up well and are compact. I just keep them in my suitcase all the time so I'm ready to go !"
5,Great little set,"The curlers get hot very quickly and remain hot long enough to thoroughly set the curl. Zippered top is superior to the velcro-held flap of some sets, so the clips don't get lost in your travels."
4,Smaller than I expected,"This is more intended for pack and travel....very cute. However, I have lots of thick hair. Could use a couple extra rollers. Does not get as hot as I am accustomed to, but works just the same."
4,great concept,"When ordering these rollers I had hoped for a larger size roller. This unit has 4 small, and 8 medium size rollers from a typical conair roller set. But, the set looked like a great concept."
3,Compact as needed,"Care should be taken as it's fragile. Half the base for the curlers didn't heat. It's small and includes adequate amount of curlers. If I look forward, I hope it lasts one year as it's used on a daily basis."
1,"compact, but not very hot","I remember why I like curling irons now. It's been awhile since I used hot rollers and was hoping I could use these They're neatly put together, compact and the clips secure the rollers very well. Only trouble is they don't get hot enough to curl hair. I let them heat up for half an hour and left them in for half an hour. I have a lot of body and wave in my hair, so curling is not a problem, but these curlers don't do it? Stick with the curling iron!"
4,Good value - just missing the clips!,"Rollers arrived without the clips!!! Fortunately - had my ""old"" con-air clips that worked.Great for travel -- and will use at home. Just wish it had a ""power light"" or indicator of some type to signal when it's plugged in."
4,Great travel curlers,"This set is wonderfully compact (my favorite part!) and easy to use. I've been using it for months (when I travel) and it still heats up really nicely (takes about 10 minutes). The curlers are a little on the smaller side and sometimes I don't get the satisfying click when I place the curler on it's base, but for the most part it's doing exactly what I wanted it to: Gives me decent curls without taking up all my luggage space."
2,No improvement from years ago,"Regrettably, this hair setter is no improvement over the one I used 20 years ago:rollers are heavy, the starter strip doesn't really help the roller grip hair stands for a smooth, neat roll-up and the metal clips are a pain to slip on the rollers. 'Medium' rollers are small diameter, but the 8 larger rollers were adequate to set the top layers of my med. length hair.Heat is gentle and the rollers did provide a slight lift (I left them in for 30 minutes). The unit is compact and therefore easy to store or travel with.Credit card 'points' covered the price of the unit; for that reason, I'll keep it but use it only occasionally.I would not buy this again, although such setting products are probably all pretty much alike."
1,Roller Clips Much Too Short,"The clips that hold the roller in the hair are much too short. Rollers fall out. If clips were longer, they would probably work. Suggestion: Make longer clips. Other than that, It's looks to be a nice product even though I wasn't able to try it out."
1,Not dual voltage,"This product is described in the Amazon description as dual voltage. The one I received is 120 only - not dual voltage. Now I have to deal with the private vendor. Since I am leaving on a trip, I do not have time to return and receive a new item. I am not happy.Update - I called the vendor (at my expense.) The person I spoke to said Conair described it as dual voltage but it is not. Do not order this product if you need dual voltage."
2,Just Ok,"This curlers set is exact exactly the size I was looking for but the curlers themselves are disappointing. First the actual curler base is oval not round. Second the curlers have teeth which I thought was great at first but they totally get tangled in my fine hair when I'm trying to remove them. On a positive note, they do heat up quickly."
2,Did not work,"I recently had my hair styled and thought curlers would help me maintain the style--unfortunately the curlers were too small, they really didn't heat up as fast as the instructions said they would, I also had trouble making sure they were connected to the heat source--the casing is just too floppy for that I think--also, I didn't like the pins--the curlers kept on flopping around on my head and just weren't hot enough to do the job. I returned them and will stick with a curling iron."
4,"Small package, Big results","I was impressed with how quickly they heated up and the amount of curl it produced. Wish they came in a bigger size, the curl was a little tight for me and maybe it's just an adjustment of time in hair and amount of hair per roller. Overall, excellent!"
2,the pins don't hold well,you have to make sure all the rolles are pushed down on the heater. The way the pins hold the rolles isn't that easy.
1,Conair electric rollers,"The size of this set is great for travel and convenience, but the rollers do not get very hot and do nothing for my hair. The hair doesn't even curl (grey hair). No good for me."
3,They work,These curlers work ok. Just ok. They don't get very hot though. They are convenient for traveling abroad. My curls looked pretty but didn't hold very long.
2,Moderate Curling Ability,"I purchased these based on their compact size for travel. Unfortunately they don't seem to heat sufficiently to make long lasting curls. I debated whether to send these back, tried them 2 times, and this morning decided to return them. I made my decision based on how my hair looks today after using a standard size curling setter. My hair is much fuller, much bouncier, with much more long lasting curls. By the end of 3 hours with the Conair compact, my hair would be pretty much uncurled, with maybe some slight curling left at the ends. It just doesn't justify the price. I'll be looking for a replacement that heats better and provides better curling."
3,Travel hot rollers,"I was very happy with the rapidity of the delivery and the product works just fine, but was disappointed that the rollers were so small. Apparently, my idea of jumbo and the manufacturer's idea are different. If you have short hair, this is ideal, but for longer hair, it makes the curl too tight, hence the need for JUMBO rollers. With this said, the product itself is fine and it is indeed small enough to through in your luggage without taking up heaps of room. If you are looking for rollers that will give hair below your shoulders a nice bounce, these rollers are to small to do the job."
4,Great travel curlers,"I have fine, long-ish hair and these curlers worked really well for me. They warmed up very fast (I'd say 2-5 minutes), and gave my hair a nice curl, (though a little bumpy in places). But the size is amazing; it's tiny! It took up no space in my suitcase unlike the other travel models out there. Plus there are 12 curlers in the pack--also very unlike other models. For those two reasons I highly recommend them."
3,Size?,"It would have been very helpful if the size of the rollers was included in the description of the product. I wanted much larger rollers and from the description given, thought that they would be. The actual box the rollers came in was worn and slightly torn and looked like it had been opened many times. Luckily I was able to sell them to a friend so I don't have to deal with a return. Also, NO packing slip was included in the box."
3,A Mixed Experience,"I had these for about 2-3 years and I was pretty happy with them. The curlers are a nice design, the clips work well, and overall I liked them. The layout of the set was nice and small/compact but a little bulky for travelling--the new ones I just bought, Remington H-1015, have a more streamlined design for about the same amount of curlers and so I think will be better for travel. The main reason I am knocking some stars off this review, however, is that they recently broke for apparently no reason, just stopped heating up at all. I got a lot of use out of them, but a couple years is really not a great life span."
3,Tangles,"My hair is long, and during the unrolling process, these curlers tangle in my hair. The rollers do produce a good curl and don't cost the earth."
2,curlers small and cumbersome,"These curlers are quite small and the curls made me look a bit like Shirley Temple as a youngster (which probably dates me by the reference -- but let's put it this way, not becoming on an-at-least-middle-aged person) There is no way to know when the curlers are hot. The curlers stayed in just fine and are easy to keep clean. It is certainly compact for travel.If you want small, tight curls this is a good option for travel because you get more than the five jumbos in other travel cases. But it doesn't work for those of us that like jumbo and super jumbo rollers.Like other reviewers for travel or at home, I am looking for hot air curlers of sufficient number that are all super-jumbo or at least a true jumbo size!"
1,Conair Setters,"Too Small.... And made my hair Fuzzy! Recommended for short hair, or a Teen. I could not use them. Sorry"
2,Eh... not the greatest,"True, this book is full of great information. If that's your only basis for analysis, then fine, it's good.But it tries to be so politically correct that at some points it can't speak at all. Many of the paragraphs are phrased quite redundantly, + there are entire sections of expository text that are a waste of time.I'm just glad I had a good professor to teach me this, or I would have absolutely hated this book."
5,An excellent resource for any person studying theater.,"This is a [must have] for anyone who desires to study theater outside of high school and into college. Throughout my studies in college, I constantly referred back to this piece for references. It is an expensive book, but trust me. You will get your money's worth out of this one."
3,good book,"It is well written, easy to understand. it is a bit superficial, does not go to much deep. It is an esy to get an idea of the history of theatre in general."
2,Incomplete & Poorly Edited,"I'm required to use this text for the theatre history sequence I teach at a state university. I frequently have to refer to Brockett to fill in the missing historical information. On many occasions I've found information in the text that is simply not well-researched and out-of-line with even the most conservative theatre scholarship. Wilson & Goldfarb also need a decent editor. There is considerable repetition of information, and the structure of the text leaves much to be desired. In an attempt to make theatre history non-threatening, the book only succeeds in being inconsistently informative. Had I been required to buy this text as an undergraduate, I would have sold it as soon as possible. I still have my Brocket text from the 1990s--and it's still a useful reference..."
5,Ignore Mike Brown!,"Ignore Mike Brown's review! The animals were definately NOT tied down!Ok so this was filmed in the 1930's with that sort of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom Un PC format. If you get into that mindset and ignore the ""Aw Shucks"" kinda of matinee film making you are in for a real treat.The archery skill (long bow) of Howard Hill has never been matched. The man is a savant with lots of nerve! Shooting a charging she lion! A rouge elephant! and a man eater crocodile.If you are a fan of Capstick and Ruark and the tales of the safari days of Africa, this a must see."
4,Interesting Book,Quite a fascinating book to read. Edgar Cayce was quite the amazing dude.You will be entranced.
2,disappointed,"I purchased this book based on other reviews. for me it was just a rehash of so many other self help books . that said, I understand ideas that are true could be come across as that. I guess I was hoping for a more unique approach to this subject"
4,vintage and fantastic!,"These are a real winning pair of earrings!They are a great classic, vintage style and the hot pink adds a great modern, edgy style that draws that right attention up to your face!Really adore these!"
2,Minority Families in the United States,"""Minority Families in the United States"" is a required textbook for a class I am taking. Unfortunately, the professor requires A LOT of outside reading that we are expected to download and copy (wasting ink, paper, and the environment). Although there is required reading from this book, it is not the focus of her lectures. What I have read I find dry -- like a textbook! I am sure there are more interesting books that can be used for textbooks. I would not purchase this book to read for pleasure. On a positive note, it does cover most of the ethnic minority groups that we have in the United States. For a brief overview of each group, this book does cover the necessary information."
5,Best Workout Video,"Buy this one if you truly want to change your body. It will help you loose inches and change the way your clothes fit. It is work, but it is worth it. Stick with it for 6 weeks, working out 5 days a week and you will have results. I've bought many workout videos and this is the only one that gives you a long, lean body!"
4,A good work out,The work out is good especially for a 68 year old like me. It is just what it says - a basic training workout - nothing too challenging. I do it on the days when I cannot spend my usual 30 minutes on an elliptical machine but want to keep the muscles working and the blood flowing.
5,OLDIE BUT GOODIE,"This is an older workout from the early 1990's. I remember watching her workout show on ESPN. Just because it is old, does not mean it's not an effective workout. There is a good warm up,a low impact aerobic section, a separate toning section,followed by a complete cool-down. Total body workout!I love the aerobic section, easy moves that get your heart rate up. I love the fact that it is on a military base with Marines working out with you. That makes it different from other workouts! This is just a good one to have! Loved it!"
3,In a word; sticky.,"The product does exactly what it says, but getting it into the cat is the issue you'll probably face. It's smells like maple syrup and my cat liked the taste, but had too much trouble eating it with dry food. It's so sticky it will clump all the food into a ball. This made it far too difficult to chew on and it got rolled around until it hardened. A few drops always wound up on the bottom of the bowl and my cat disapproved. The bottle is also a constant problem, because there's always some of this glue-like paste that runs into and around the cap. Every time you unscrew the top you'll have a mess on your hands and will eventually need to scrape the stuff off. I didn't need to use much of it so the bottle might not bother other people. This product might not cause problems with other cats, but mine always looked like she was trying to chew peanut butter and learned to avoid it."
3,Okay I guess,I only used it once or twice. My cats did not like the taste at first but eventually ate it mixed with the food. Directions said to put a little bit on the cat's nose so they could get used to the smell. Some brands of cat food have high fiber and this serves the same purpose for hairball control.Since using the hairball control cat food my cats have not barfed up their food in weeks. One kitty used to barf up every day and was starting to look so skinny. She is fine now. I would recommend the high fiber diet for all cats.You don't really need the Laxatone to solve the problem.
5,Read All Of His,"If you like Gibson's work, well here is where he copied his ideas from. Well written and good technology. Read them all."
4,This is America,"Lots of interesting tales that take place in small cities across our beautiful land told by a little old lady who has learned much and experienced much in her ninety years. I loved the book, but I also read another book at the same time (i.e. the book is a good read, but reading about one town after another, after another, after another requires a break after a while)."
4,An American hero,"Impressive account of this amazing woman's walk from shore to shore, the heat in the desert, the cold at times, thefolks who invited her to stay in their homes, and her message of the very unsatisfactory way of funding campaigns,so candidates are not free to make the best decisions, but must reward their contributors. She is an inspirationto those older folks who have given up, and are content to sit on their chairs and piss and moan, and not do anything. She is one whose book urged me to write mine, PLAYLADY, Tales of a Recreational Therapist. She didit in her 90's, why not me in my 60's?"
4,What an inspiration.,"I saw Granny D's obituary in New Hampshire last year, and had no idea who she was. Wanting to be more knowledgeableabout this walking across America feat, I read the book, and behold! what a challenge that was for an 89 year old!She had arthritis and other ailments, but didn't let that stop her. I hope her campaign finance reform voice ishelpful in ending what is basically a bribe-reward system."
2,"Interesting catch, poor execution","I read this book as a recommendation from my school freshmen year in college. To be honest, this book could have been 10 pages long. The story was interesting for the first few pages but it became extremely repetitive. This book basically had two elements: stories about the people/cultures she encountered on her walk, and complaints about politics. The book never became specific with its politics, just general statements. If you're going to be political, then be political; don't be general. Second, the people she encountered were described the same throughout the book.Let me summarize the whole story with one short paragraph:""I met some amazing people today that let me into their home warmly. It always amazes me how trusting people can be. I also hate corporations and greedy politicians. We need change. Let's go walking again."""
5,ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY STAPLER,THIS LITTLE GADGET IS GREAT FOR STAPLING A FEW PAGES TOGETHER. NO METAL STAPLES NECESSARY. ALSO GREAT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. I LOVE THEM GLAD I BOUGHT 4 GAVE 2 AWAY ALREADY.
1,how can any body review . You don't provide any information,"Don't know anything about this cd. You don't provide any information,sound tract or who the musician,or artist in it. Imposible to do any evaluation feed back without it."
4,Interesting Book,"Kitty Ferguson gives a lot of info on Stephen Hawking's life and works, being a small book in size it is full of interesting theories on Universe and Black Holes. It is purely scientific book thus it tries to explain everything scientifically, eventhough Stephen Hawking sometimes accepts that science cannot prove some things that are beyond our reach, nevertheless he does not accept that the whole universe is a God's creation.""The Creation of the Universe"" by Hrun Yahya is an excellent book which explains scientifically how God has created the Universe."
4,Really liked it,I bought it as a gift for my mother and she liked it a lot. Its a sleek watch and I personally think it is better suited for slender wrists. Good dress watch!
2,More Like an Infomercial Than an Instructional Video,"VERY little useful content...maybe a total of 7-9 minutes of actual description and instruction. Mr. Nishioka's praises are extolled ad nauseum, and great things are promised for the additional videos in the series.Oh, and the sound was horrible as well! The narrator's voice was distorted and ""pegged"" to the right channel.So, based on this one, I'm just going to ""say no"" to the succeeding Judo volumes."
1,"I don't want to be negative, but...","Of course this is the 2nd and last album released by the post-Shane Pogues. ""Waiting for Herb"" had already given a clear indication that the band was spent. Shane played such a dominant role in the Pogues, that his absence is just glaring. I hate dogging the boys, I mean it was not like them and Shane had this heated split. Shane wanted to leave the band and the guys were tired of dealing with this drunken and erratic behavior. However, that drunkard is perhaps the greatest songwriter of all time and the boys should have tolerated him a little more."
4,Irish Punk! Makes me want a beer,"I've just recently been introduced to the pogues, but I will soon be getting more. I noticed that Pogue Magone only had 2 stars while Fall/Grace/God had 5. I have to say I cannot stop myself from singing along with Pogue Mahone, all the songs rock. My wife and I even played anniversary at our wedding! Grace/God is excellent but Mahone is far better."
2,Pleasant Surprise,"I resisted buy this CD for a long time cause I just could not imagine the Pogues without Shane. It's no the same without Shane but this CD is worth having. Great job on Dylan's ""When my ship comes in."""
1,Ugh,"Honestly-- anyone who thinks Pogue Mahone is better than the first three Pogues' albums (or is even in the same league with them), mostly likely also prefers the Corrs to the Clancy Brothers & Makem, Guster to the Rolling Stones, and a veggie burger to a prime rib. This is no exaggeration at all. A few songs would be decent if this were not The Pogues-- when you raise the bar high you need to meet it."
3,A solid lyrics-based album,"There are a few attention-getting tracks on the album, but most of it left me merely absent-mindedly toe-tapping. I was thinking of re-selling it, but then sat down and listened while reading the lyrics: there are near a half dozen strong songs (1,3,6,10,13) plus two outstanding tracks (5,8). Most lyrics are by band members (and Spider sings them understandably), but an extreme case is ""When the Ship Comes In"": unremarkable music made dramatic by Bob Dylan lyrics.So not as strong as other Pogues albums, but it's no slacker, especially if you usually pay strong attention to lyrics, and consider passing otherwise."
2,Not the Pogues!,"I've heard some songs from the Pogues before, and was very impressed. The Pogues come highly recommended and I absolutely love Shane McGowan's drunken Irish singing. Shane McGowan is a legend. He's a brilliant songwriter. Shane McGowan is the Pogues.But McGowan is not with the Pogues for this album. And it severely suffers as a result. I was not aware of this when I purchased this album. I was sorely disappointed. The new singer is mediocre, and the music is rather uninspired. Without Shane McGowan, the Pogues simply don't exist.If you're looking for classic Pogues, don't buy this album. You'd be much better off picking up such classics as ""Red Roses For Me"" or ""Rum, Sodomy, and The Lash"". That's what I'll be doing.I only hope I can forgive myself for wasting money on ""Pogue Mahone"". Maybe it'll grow on me in time. But I doubt it."
3,pogue mahone,"It's not a Shane ! I saw a lot of people crying because Shane has left the group.Ok, I agree it's not exactly the same thing but it's not unnecessary bad. For sure this album miss some of Shane' witty and outrogeus lyrics but as well it's not spitting out songs at 100 mph, sounds and arrangements are cleaner, and Spider shows the world Pogues are still alive. Somehow ordinary but good listening"
3,Swan song.,"Just listen to 'Four O'Clock In The Morning' to see just how desperate for inspiration the Pogues had become by this time. It's no wonder that the best tracks on this album - which could hold their own on any previous Pogues release - are covers: Dylan's ""When The Ship Comes In"" and the obscure but brilliant Ronnie Lane single, ""How Come.""With three new Pogues in the lineup, this album has a level of energy lacking in its predecessor, and it could stand on it's own if one wasn't familiar with the Pogues from '84-'90, but it can't compare to the music this band created in its heyday."
1,Not the Pogues,"Shane MacGowan, for better or worse was the heart & soul of this band. A true irish shanachie in the tradition of Brendan Behan. Spend your money on either of the 2 post-pogues albums by ""Shane MacGowan and the Popes"" instead. They are far superior to either of the 2 Pogues recordings (Waiting For Herb & Pogue Mahone) made after Shane's departure."
4,Don't roll your eyes just yet...,"Okay, so it's not Rum Sodomy and the Lash (honestly, why people go looking for an album in other albums is beyond me). Pogue Mahone is a good album in it's own right. It's got some gems such as: ""Where that Love's Been Gone"" (which almost has a Cajun feel), ""Bright Lights"" and ""Oretown"". I'll admit that the album as a whole isn't an instant classic, but every once in a while I just have to listen to at least my favorite tracks on it.It's not better than Rum by any means...but it's just as good as Red Roses For Me. And if some of you pretentious Pogues fans don't agree with me...you can just Pogue Mahone."
4,"finally, JEFF BECK !!!",Some of this compilation is a bit stretched... I mean Chuck Berry and Alic Cooper on the same cd takes some getting used to.The absolutely best thing is finally hearing Freeway Jam included on this kind of set. Always one of my favorite songs and you must turn it way up...
4,Quirky Packaging but a Keeper.,"This is one of those strange, offbeat European releases--who knows where they got the tape? The major two quirks about the CD are the title (since ""No Greater Love,"" a tune Sonny often performed, is not on the album) and the sound of Eddie Lockjaw Davis' unmistakable tenor sax on two of the tunes (""LAX"" and ""Four""). Besides the unannounced Lockjaw, an unidentified trumpet player solos on the aforementioned cuts.As for the music, it's fine late Stitt and characteristically heated Lockjaw. The trumpet player's presence is minimally felt (possibly Harry Sweets Edison, since one of the tunes is a Sweets' original). The rhythm section is on fire the whole way (few drummers swing like Duffy Jackson; few piano players can match Eddie Higgins' chops and ideas). The sound is very ""present,"" capturing the ambience of live performance but also balancing the instruments very tastefully.At the right price, this one is definitely a keeper."
5,Hysterical.,"Ellen is a classic and this CD proves she was funny from the beginning. If you enjoy her comedy, you will love this CD."
3,"Funny, but some of the ingredients were left out.","I really like this ""early Ellen"" monologue. However, the gaps between each track contain jokes that I thought were hilarious. Seems that someone else decided it was okay to cut them. If there is a DVD or video of this monologue, I would love to get my hands on it.Furthermore, this CD is dated. Besides the standup, there are also downloadable files for both PCs and Macs. Whatever those files are, the Mac version will work on OS 9 but not OS X."
5,Love Atlantis,"I think this was a great spin off from stargate sg-1 which was starting to get stale even though I love watching it still.Love being able to download them all, just wish they'd get updated quicker!Honestly, when I left 2 weeks ago I saw the last episode available and I've missed the next 2."
1,Amazon Unbox a Mess,"Amazon Unbox needs to fix their video download application. I am unable to run it on 512mb of RAM. It completely hogs all memory locking up computer. I ordered this season and was unable to download even one episode. When I requested customer support, I was sent an email with computer specification info after I had already included my computers specs and that they met minimum specifications.Stay away from Amazon Unbox."
1,Episode Great....this service SUCKS,"I can't begin to tell you how annoyed I am with NBC Universal for pulling their stuff off of iTunes. iTunes works...this service doesn't. I downloaded the episode but it doesn't play correctly. At first the color was off and I had to disable the ability to adjust brightness and contrast (hello..those shouldn't affect color). Then about 10 minutes in the episode won't play any further. So, I am sure the episode itself is great because Atlantis is awesome but this service is a waste of time and money."
5,"Best Scifi out there, but remember to watch it LIVE too!","Stargate Atlantis is in my opinion, the best Scifi show out there. The look and feel of the show is amazing, and the characters have depth and appeal. Remember to watch the show LIVE in the U.S. too, that's the only way the ratings will count! Remember, we have to keep the ratings up to get the show renewed for further seasons!"
2,great show - poor quality video,"I bought the first episode of season 5 in the video download version because I wanted the cliffhanger from season 4 resolved. I might even buy more versions, but the quality of the downloaded video is quite poor. The lighting, even when adjusted on my laptop, is odd and often things are not quite in focus. It may just be my laptop, but I have no problem with instant play on Netflix. I think I'll wait until the technology is a bit more perfected to spend my money on anymore unbox episodes."
4,Magical sounds from Escandinavia,"Aftre you finish reading this, the next thing you have to do it's buy this CD. It's not chill out, it's not ambient, it's nothing but great electronic music, naive sounds made by intelligent people from a cold place. The electronic scence in Escandinavia has a totally diferent focus and with Future 3 you will realize that. If you like Bjork's ""Vespertine"" this records will blow your mind.If you find more music from April records, don't think it twice, buy it!!"
2,Blue Hamsa Necklace,"The necklace arrived exactly as it was shown and described. Attractive, colorful yet it generated feelings of coldness rather than warmth for me. In fact, my body rejected the energy which the necklace emitted.I contacted the seller, explained the situation, and had absolutely no problem in returning the item. The seller was polite, cooperative and honest."
4,Very clean performance,"This is not the most brilliant of the recordings that I've heard of Prokofiev symphony no. 5, but it is the second on my list. First belongs to New York Philharmonic conducted by Kurt Masur. Even so, Bravo! Slatkin."
1,What a let down...is it just me?,"What can I say about this movie from Israel with English Subtitles? Oh yeah, there are no subtitles I can bring up. Is it me? It looked interesting as I watched a foreign film trying to work out what the hell was going on...and a lot was going on. It did look interesting, for instance one of the boys (hustler) was with another young man in bed. He got out and went into a drawer and was caught...then handcuffed and abused and his body sold to some old guy, then let go... When I CAN watch it, IF I can watch it I will tell you more.Don't want anyone else disappointed...and as I say, it could just be me."
5,Brilliance.,"The first game in the Soul Reaver story. I couldn't really grasp the genius of the game at first, but after playing Soul Reaver: Legacy of Kain I went back to this game and could understand the effort that was put into this game. This game made the path for its predecessors with its dark, gothic enviroment and puzzles. You are Kain and the hatred that boils for the people that killed you is unfathomable. You have been brought to life through black sorcery to take vengeance on those who betrayed you. This is a great story line and the carnage that is incorporated into the game only adds on to suspense and fun. Like a vampire you need blood for sustenance and obtaining it is always fun. The puzzles are good and so is the game. So if you are into the dark games like me get this game."
5,Love it!,I am tired of everyone saying the people in the band look like Pirates! Whats up with that? Matchbox 20's cd is beautiful. Every single track is full of emotion and I love it! The lyrics are great and actually have meaning. I don't see how anyone could sit down and listen to this cd and hate it.
1,Sailing the Seven Seas,"In watching matchbox 20 every hour on TV have come noticed something, that they dressed like pirates. I am noticing a trend in poular music today, evry one with a hit dresses like a pirate, to an extent. Whether it be Puff Daddy, Eagle Eye Cherry, or Rob and his maties they all can be compared to pirates. I think record company execs have noticed this trend, and they like it. I applaud these execs for packageig in radio friendly music with a halloween/Captin Kid Motif. It seems that no matter what talent these so called musician have, as long as the look the the seafarers of the 1700s they'll have a multi-paltinum album. This album, is horrid, it's too radio friendly for my tastes. anyway there is no need to buy the album, it seem that Rob and his maties have ""pirated the air play to get more exposure than ""Jagged Little Pill"" by Alanis Morisette ( remember the summer of 96). If I could I'd give this album no stars and the band a wordrobe change."
1,this type of music should be illegal,"I am an advid music fan and it makes me sick to believe that such unoriginal, zero talent, complete recycled polished puss is packaged onto a disc and sold. I don't see how anyone could possibly take this band seriously. I give it 0 stars. Matchbox 20, thrid eye blind, and these other similar ""bands"" should be exterminated like roaches. The people who signed them should go to jail. And those of us who feel the same way about them as I do should have the memories of their ""songs"" erased from our brains. It is these types of bands that are corroding the music industry. Matchbox 20 is to music what Dominos is to pizza. All of the songs sound alike and the lyrics are the same 'ol laddy daddy."
1,Sickening,"This could seriosly be the most disgusting album ever made. That's right if you heard one song you heard them all, so, what's the point. Please people Mr. Thomas is a joke. The video to ""3 a.m."" just makes me sick, but I leave it there because laughing is good for your health. And if I ever here another person say this album is the best first album for a group since Pearl Jam, I'll get sick, literally. They are not even close to Pearl Jam and never will be! It should have gotten a 0!"
4,"Rob can sing in only one key, but the lyrics hit home","Like many others, I bought this CD because of ""Push"". And while I immediately liked ""3 am"" and predicted the release of ""Real World"", I noticed one thing - after a while, ""Kody"" and ""3 am"" were very alike in beat and arrangement. Then the rest of the songs on album started sounding all alike (save for the rather interesting addition of oboes and woodwinds on ""back 2 good"" - well, perhaps the down-home acoustic ""hang"" falls out of the alike category too) with very similar guitar licks, etc. But the lyrics save the album - no real hidden meanings, but exactly what every good songwriter does: relate to the rest of (the much less talented) us the common folk and turn it into art."
1,Shiver Me Timbers,"Aaargh, matee. This pirate looking quartet from Florida have inspired a new craze in the puffy shirt and hoop earring scene. And to accompany their latest craze is their lack luster release. This radio friendly wonderband is well on its way obscurity and obesity, the same fate Ginger Spice is now living out."
3,A group that doesn't have much to say in titles,"This is probably one of the most interesting phenomenon to happen where the words in the title of a song are mostly one or two words long. Well the production is fairly sparse, and the guitars are not too fuzzy sounding, but it qualifies for adult alternative. Mostly an alright collection of songs, but it's alot of hit and miss with miss winning more. ""Real World"" and ""Push"" will probably be my all time favorite M-20 songs, the rest are either in the deep realms of my memory, or I just plain hated them. ""3 A.M"" is one of them. A passible beginning, but I would've wanted them to continue in this vein before releasing Mad Season."
5,Lots of energy throughout the album - MAJOR talent,I just bought this yesterday. Very impressive vocals. This album will keep your head moving and fingers tapping the whole time- lots of energy. I like how it doesnt seem like they are trying to copy the trends.
4,"Great, Finally someone gave us a break from teenyboppers...","This is a great CD, if you take out the profanity (which isn't that bad compared to most CDs nowadays, but still). I love ""Real World,"" ""3 AM,"" ""Push,"" and ""Back 2 Good"" and I'm glad that a real band who write their own songs and play their own instruments and are an all-around great band finally got some songs on the radio. Now I can listen to the radio again."
2,Good?,"This CD, after coming out with their epic hit ""3 am"", hit the charts at number one. Right now though, they are awful. Their repetitive tunes are getting old. Songs like Back 2 good and Push don't cut it anymore."
2,About that singer...,"On paper, this could actually work. If only the singer didn't sound so constipated all the time. This is pseudo rock for 13 year-old girls. (I admit that a couple of songs here are kind of catchy, though)."
2,Hate them so much I'm writing a second review.,"Anybody who says that Matchbox 20 is their favorite band and that Rob Thomas's lyrics are the best they've heard so far obviously quit school because they are not educated to not like them. People who never quit school or are still in school like me are educated to know that Matchbox 20 is not a band to be admired. Check out The Goo Goo Dolls. NOW THAT'S A BAND TO BE ADMIRED! ! ! !P.S. Rob Thomas can't sing, either! I mean, have you heard him scream his vocal cords (If he has any) hoarse in Back 2 Good?!"
2,This CD just doesn't measure up to par.,"Yourself or someone like you is just not a very good CD. It does not seem that bad the first time you listen to it but it quickly becomes tiresome. There are not any great musicians in the band and the singer does not have an outstanding voice. This band just doesn't have enough talent, its destined for mediocrity."
3,It's OK...Not as great as what people say.,"Matchbox 20 seems to do a better job with songs that have an upbeat tempo (Real World & Girl Like That), but some of the other songs are just to slow and not well composed.This is not to say I don't despise this selection of songs by the group - I just think it could have been better with what they seem to do best. Hopefully on their next recording, they'll pick up the pace a little bit.All in all, not a bad debut... It's just a bit overrated."
3,Matchbox 20 is a typical Top 40 Pop group and not a rock gro,"Matchbox 20 is your garden variety Top 40 pop group like Hootie and the Blowfish, Counting Crows & The Wallflowers There were many such groups in the 1960's; The Rascals, The Turtles and Gary Puckett and the Union Gap come to mind. The aforementioned groups from the 1960's were adept at churning out singles. Few people bought their albums. The large sales volume of the Matchbox 20 CD owes more to the death of the single rather than to the quality of the music on the CD. It doen't make sense to group Matchbox 20 in with AOR groups such as Pearl Jam. As a pop singles group Matchbox 20 is about average and gets a three star rating"
4,definetly a cool CD!,"With Any Matchbox 20 song, you either love it or hate it, there isn't a lot in between. i personally like almost every song on this CD. there is enough variety to have a song for any mood. after listening to the CD over and over, many songs to start to sound alike, and fade into each other, but this is one of those CD's that you miss listening to if you put it away for a while."
2,a bunch of sorry pop-rock,"this cd has some sorry pop-rock on it, the only reason it gets two stas is because of ""Long Day""."
5,Classic album!,"This is definately an all-time classic album. Tracks like Real World, long day, 3 AM, Push, Girl Like That and Argue will be on the radio for years to come."
2,Hootie revisited,"Hey does anyone out there remember Hootie and the Blowfish? If you do, would you actually admit to having bought their CD? Trust me, Matchbox fans: about 90% of you will no longer be interested in this band by the time their third album rolls around. Before you know it, most of you will have jumped on the next bandwagon and you will have completely forgotten about MB20. Just like you forgot about Hootie."
2,It's all so dull,"How many alterna-clones like this can you get? It's just the latest in the string of guitar bands with an offbeat vocalist who puts strange inflection on his voice because he can't REALLY sing. Plus, it is overplayed on the radio, especially 'Push' which is one of the most irritating alternative songs ever (the lyrics are moronic). I'm actually not sure why I gave it two stars. I guess they deserve credit for not being rap music. Not reccomended at all."
1,Decline of Western Music as we know it!,"Just when you thought alternative music could not get any worse, this band comes out. Alternative music has now become what metal became in the late 80's. This is the alternaive equivalent of Poison, Warrant, (insert any other Hair band). When alternative music becomes unpopular, this band will be back where they belong, working at the Waffle House. Backstreet Boys are actually a step above these guys."
5,Brilliant,"The readers of Rolling Stone magazine were right when they chose Matchbox 20 as the best new artist of 1997. With exquisite instrumentals and ethereal vocals, this band has blown away critics and music lovers alike. The incredible songs on this album have a definite profound quality, and one can find so many different meanings in the layers of depth that Rob Thomas (lead vocals, lyricist) has created. Not to mention the beautiful guitar melodies and crashing drum beats. Unlike other albums, the songs on Yourself Or Someone Like You actually sound independent from each other. Compare the soft ""Back 2 Good"" to the pounding ""Busted"" and you'll see that this isn't another cookie-cutter band. Matchbox 20 may be popular, but that fact shouldn't discredit them. This album is a gem, one of the few that never leaves my CD player. I found someone who seems to understand me in this music. Because I'm not the only one who's ""terrified of no one else but me""."
4,It's a good CD to have if your depress,"I haven't heard all the songs.But 4 of them like ""PUSH"",""Back2Good"" ""RealWorld""and ""3AM""I might get this CD."
1,Dead Boring,"This album should be titled 1001 ways to rip off Hootie and the Blowfish, with one half the talent. The music is dead boring. And the melodies are brain dead. The lyrics are at most average. This is the kind of album that makes you wonder if rock is truly dead. There was some controversy over whether the song ""Push"" is about abusing women. Who cares. A song that horrible doesn't deserve controversy."
1,corporate lame mainstream music,this cd does NOT deserve the four stars awarded by fellow amazon surfers. matchbox 20 play unoriginal wannabe pop alternative that tailors itself to the wants of Mtv.buy the verve's urban hymns because you'll get the hit as well as a perfect album
1,"Lacking strength and energy, pure and simple","I am glad to know that some of the old rock bands (DEF LEPPARD.....EUPHORIA!!), as well as one of the 90s better rock bands PEARL JAM ('better' is not a strong enough word for Vedder and the boys; more like EXCEPTIONAL) are coming back with new stuff. This band just doesn't have what it takes. That's all I can say."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY.,"I definitly made a big mistake buying this CD for recomendation. I listened to it just once, and I haven't listened to it again. It's just so boring. I wouldn't call this ""music"". I'd call it garbage. (with no ofense to the band named ""garbage"" which is great). Don't buy this disc."
1,Garbage,"""I wish the real world would just stop hassling me.."" Get out of junior high school and grow up."
1,Most over-rated band of the 90's.,"And that's saying a lot because there have been a lot of them. The lyrics are either overblown or pointless, and the music is pedestrian. I find the vocals annoying too."
5,The Best CD Ever Made!,"This cd is absolutely the best cd ever made! Seriously! I first got it just because of Push and that was back in September and now it never comes out of the cd player. I mean never ever. If you want a really good cd that you could listen to over and over and over again, then this is definately the one you should own. The music is such a variety and the vocals of Rob Thomas are outstanding. Also, if you ever get the chance, go see them in concert. I have gone twice and I would go a million times more. This band is the best and they will be around for a long time. This is one cd you have to buy!"
4,Good intial effort,"Although this band has been played en masse in top 40 radio stations and does not exactly appear as real alterna-rockers, they appear to be having fun along the way in a non-mean spirted way.Even myself a devoted Alternative fan (Nirvana, Bikini Kill, Hole..etc) found the tunes catchy enough to stick in my head and subsequently bought the album. While I suspect (unlike the other bands mentioned above) some of the anguish might be manufactured and/or molded, I'm willing to look the other way."
4,I like this C.D. pretty well.,"It is a great C.D. but after a while you have to put it down for a little bit. Still I can honestly say it can really pick you up while your feeling down. I really like real world. As long as you don't over play it you will love it for a long time. Also if you ever get a chance, their concerts are awesome."
1,Used it as a frisbee,"There is a couple of mediocre songs on this album, but you wouldn't believe how far you can launch a cd if thrown properly. I would have to say that along with ""Tonic"", this was one out of the two most fun and exciting cd's that I've ever owned!!!!!!!!"
2,A major dissapointment,"I bought this album with the hope that Matchbox 20 would be something new and fresh that could change rock music. I was wrong. The major problem with Yourself or Someone like you is I know what's around every corner. As a listener, I want the music to chalenge me. This does nothing of the sort. Another problem, which is not the band's fault, is that all the singles were destroyed by FM radio. I've heard the song ""3AM"" so many times I want to puke. It goes back to the repetiveness. With the first single ""Push"", I thought they had something going. The the next single ""3Am"" came out and it just didn't chalenge me. Rob Thomas's voice, however strong it might be, has an annoying hitch to it that makes me think how yet another standard rock band made it this far. This album is worth one listen, but for god's sake, don't buy it!!"
1,Warning this CD contains an irratating repetitive voice,I bought yourself or someone like you when a friend told me what a great cd it was but how wrong he was instead the cd just shows what an annoying and irratating band matchbox 20 is if anyone can listen to the whole cd non-stop for over 60 minutes then it is a great achievement I have never heard such an irratating voice in my life and if this band can pass as a rock group then I should have my try and it might sound better.
4,"At 3 a.m., they r not lonely; I am listening to them!!",My two favorite groups: 3rd Eye Blind & Matchbox 20. They are sooooooo good! My friends think that I have a good taste of music. They r all right!!!!!!!
5,The Best Ever,Matchbox 20 has to be the best band I have ever heard. The lyrics make you think about your life and at least one song on the album fits your mood. The music is wonderful and Rob Thomas' vocals are incredible. His voice is enough to buy the album. I have already worn out my first copy. BUY IT IMMEDIATELY!
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,THIS CD BLOWS. THIS BAND BLOWS. THERE MUSIC BLOWS. THIS ONE OF THE WORST BANDS I HAVE EVER HEARD. DO NOT WASTE $15 DOLLARS ON THAT PIECE OF CRAP. ANY BAND THAT HAS BAND MEMBERS THAT PAINT THEIR NAILS ARE DESTINED TO BLOW AS BAD THIS BAND. TRY LISTENING TO SOMETHING GOOD BANDS LIKE GUTTERMOUTH OR THE VOODOO GLOW SKULLS. TAKE MY WORD ON IT.
2,hmm...a classic? I doubt it.,"Real World - great song. I thought, great, this sounds like a quality album. However, the rest of the CD didn't really match up to my expectations. After a few listens, the singer's whiny voice becomes very irritating, and a lot of the songs sound very similar. So-I don't hate it, but 11 million sold? Americans tastes must be worse than I thought. Oh, and thanks a lot for Britney Spears."
1,Please go away!!,"This is the sort of band that you just wish would go away. Sure they may have some radio hits, but they got SOOO old REALLY fast! A terrible album."
1,The clock is ticking on their careers,Can anyone say one hit wonder? Chances these guys will still have a music career in five years: zero. It won't be long until you can find this cd in the discount bin with Grand Funk Railroad.
1,abosolutely pathetic,"There are endless reasons of why this music is so worthless, but I would like to make one thing clear. Matchbox 20 is not ""rock and roll."" The guitar playing is so weak, the singing is whiny, the lyrics are corny, and the rythyms are so bland that i find myself laughing (or wanting to punch something) whenever i am unfortuneate enough to be subjected to such torture as listening to this trash. To call this rock is a mockery. Who do these guys think they are fooling? They are a blatant void of talent and play with such an obvious lack of passion, not to mention they are completely unoriginal. This band is a bunch of rock and roll wannabes who would be disgraced by the true great bands they pretend to sound like. Generic, repetitive, boring, pathetic. That about sums this band up. By the way, thankfully, I never wasted my money on this cd."
1,huh?,"Where the hell did this come from? To classify this as ""music"", putting it in the same category as Slayer, Pantera and Sepultura is nothing less then an insult to those three great bands (and many others as well)"
1,Matchbox Schmatchbox,"Remember those ads on the inside of matchbox covers that promised that, through their courses, you would ""learn to draw and become a skilled artist in no time at all, with little effort""?These guys must have taken a ""learn to play and make it rich as an alternative band in no time!"" course. Man, are they lame. A Whiny, tuneless vocalist; songs that sound like they were written in two minutes; instrumentation that consists of stupidly simple chords and lame solos; well, you get the idea."
1,Sucks.dont buy it.gay,"EEEEEEECCHH! this is the worst music ever! I dont know how anyone could ever like this cd. The stupid, annoying songs are for losers.I would have given it zero stars, but what are you gonna do."
1,Just another lame alternative band.,"I will just tell you that this is just a band, that without the help of a recording studio to cover up all of the missed notes and Rob Thomas's pubetic voice would just be a lame alternative band playing at JR. HIGH DANCES."
1,THIS IS THE MOST OVERRATED CD IN HISTORY!!!,This CD is a complete waste of time and money. If you want to hear every song on this CD just tune in to your local rock station (like 96 rock) in Atlanta. They play this crap constantly. I can't turn the radio on without hearing this garbage. If I hear 3am one more time I'm going nucking futs.
3,"My name is ""Kody""!","This CD is alright. I wouldn't buy it myself, but I don't like this kind of music. I just liked that they used my name ""Kody"" for a song! No one spells it that way. The only problem is I am a girl and the song is about a guy! Oh well."
5,This is a great CD for your collection!,"I absolutely love this CD! It has so many great songs on it, and I always listen to it. It's great to listen to while you study, clean the house, hang out with friends, whatever."
1,This might indeed be the worst band of the 1990s.,"It's really fascinating to see a band with such an incredibly small amount of talent become so successful. I admit, ""Push"" was catchy, but after hearing it two or three (or eventually, two or three-thousand) times, it became very annoying. ""3AM"" and ""Real World"" (nice try with the camel in the video, guys, but it was quite dumb) are absolutely awful sequels to ""Push,"" in that they sound EXACTLY alike. And one more thing: Have you heard the lead singer talk? He talks like a normal human being. Perhaps the most annoying thing about this band (and there are plenty of annoying things) is that he completely changes his voice when he sings--whenever he hears the band in the background, I guess, he has to start grunt-singing. Get rid of the eye-liner, get rid of the black spandex, acquire some testosterone, THEN we might listen."
1,Myself and Someone Like Me,"To be frank, I really wanted to give this album no stars. After giving the album countless chances, I was quite perturbed by the lack of talent that this band seems to possess. The freshman quartet seemed to be overdoing their chops with ""hits"" such as 3 in the a.m. or push. This very generic rock is a ""mall-ternative"" type of applesauce that makes a mockery of modern rock music. Although the pirate-looking foursome did come up with explosive-like guitar riffs such as ""Real World"", the songs were just duds."
3,Interesting Work,"Very similar to the early work of Barry Manilow. You can almost hear the lyrics from ""Mandy"" in each song. I also detected the theme song from the original Captain Kangaroo in many tracks."
3,It's alright.,"When I bought this CD, a long time ago, I absolutely loved it. My favorite song was 'Push'. Now I can't stand it. I mean, it's a good CD and all, but trust me, you get sick of the songs REALLY FAST after you get it. It's also really anoying to here Rob Thomas's voice over and over again.Also, it doesn't really matter weather you get the CD or not because they play Matchbox 20 on the radio a lot. Despite all this, I'd say it's worth getting because they do have some pretty good song on the album."
5,The best CD I have ever bought.,"All of the songs I had heard on the radio were, of course, great. The rest of the CD was great, too."
1,Pure Puke,"This album is musically no worse than a lot of the Top-40 fare one typically finds on the radio. What sets it apart from the pack is the vocal contortions of Rob Thomas. This guy's gutteral croakings and alternate whinings -- which some have described as ""heartfelt"" -- will almost induce vomiting. Self pity has never been so wretchedly on display as on this grossly over-played CD. Avoid at all costs!"
5,My favorite band,"This band really clicks. I mean, they have great instrumentals, a singer with a great voice, and above all, a passionate undertone in all of their songs. It is clear that they not only enjoy what they do, but that their songs are important to them. To those of you out there who criticize Rob Thomas' voice, I think that the inflection he sings with helps carry the importance and gravity of his songs to the listener. And to those of you who are wondering when the next Matchbox20 cd is coming out, I heard that it is schedualed to be released sometime around May."
2,typical alternative crap,"I'm 15 and I bought this CD shortly after it came out. I liked ""Push"" and ""3 AM"", and even the other stuff seemed pretty good. Then about a year later i started listening to a lot of '80s rock and realized that alternative rock sucks. Van Halen, Def Leppard, Billy Idol, and Motley Crue rock, and Matchbox 20 seems pretty weak in comparison. They have no attitude, and their songs aren't very original either. If you want to get alternative rock get REM, but not this crap."
2,DISSAPOINTING,"""PUSH"" IS THE BEST SONG ON THE CD. ALL THE OTHER SONGS GET BORING AFTER A WHILE. ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME AND THE LEAD SINGERS VOICE GETS ANNOYING AFTER A WHILE. IT'S REALLY COOL FOR THE FIRST WEEK YOU HAVE IT, BUT ON THE 2 WEEK IT JUST BECOMES JUST ANOTHER CD. THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT IT."
3,I agree wholeheartedly,"The opinion of the reviewer from New Caledonia (below) is SPOT-ON. Only Rob Thomas himself could have said it better. Rob, if you're reading this, man--keep on showing us how to get that ""funky high off a yellow sun."""
3,Let me offer my Two Cents...,"There is nothing really wrong with this album. A lot of the songs are extremely catchy, and Robb Thomas' voice inflections accurately display the heartfelt emotions in many of these songs. That said, however, this album is nowhere near the fringe of Rock n' Roll greatness. The guitarist is so weak I can't even believe it. Most of the songs involve nothing more than acoustic strumming. Nonetheless, this music is easy on the ears and should find a place in your permanent collection."
3,Okay,"There are some pretty good songs on here, like Real World, 3am, Long Day is pretty good, even though his vocals are really messed up on it, Push, and the best song on the album is Hang. Not a great album, but a few good songs"
2,"Dictionary definition of ""mediocre""","I read a review of this album that described it as a masterpiece. If this album can be considered a masterpiece, then the state of rock music is in a sorry state as we are on the cusp of a new millenium. This album is not horrible - although I've grown to hate Matchbox 20 after the excessive radio play they have received - it is simply mediocre. 'Push"" and 'Long Day' are alright songs, but the album as a whole is pretty dull, and it doesn't get any better after repeated listens, either. Also, no matter what the fans out there say, the lyrics really aren't that deep - they're pretty simple. For instance: ""I wonder what it's like to be the head honcho...I wish the real world would stop hassling me."" I'm 23 years old and these lyrics even sound pretty immature to me."
1,it s*cks,"This CD is bad. Bad singing, bad music, bad everything. If there was a rating less than 1 star, that's what I would give it. Save lives--tell your friends not to buy it."
5,If it hadn't been for Santana,"I never would have discovered Matchbox 20. The songs on this CD are great, I love the lyrics and the tunes, my favorites are Long Day, 3am, and Push. Perfect soundtrack for our busy days, stuck in our cars commuting wishing we were driving to the beach with the top down. Am looking forward to Mad season, whoo hoo!"
4,Good Cd. Nice job Rob.,This is a good cd. I like it. Rob Thomas is a great singer and I hope he comes out with a new matchbox20 cd. If there second cd is better than there first I will be impressed. Its a good cd and an even better one would blow me away.
3,The rest of this album isn't as good as the singles,"I'll preface this by saying that I generally like harder, more sophisticated, less mainstream music than Matchbox 20, Third Eye Blind, late-era Goo Goo Dolls, Creed, etc. (you know the list as well as I do).But sometimes I have a soft spot for a good, catchy single. Something like ""3 a.m."" Or ""Push"" or ""Real World."" So, after hearing those songs (over and over again) on the radio and on MTV, I broke down and bought the album.Well, I still like all three of those songs quite a bit. Unfortunately, they're far and away the best on the album. A diplomatic way to put it would be to say that the singles were chosen wisely. A more blunt way to put would be to say that after the three gems, the rest of the album is pretty much faceless and mediocre.So let me reiterate -- the three singles are great. They were popular for good reason. Just don't buy this album hoping for more of the same. It's not there."
5,One of my favourites!,"It's no secret that Matchbox Twenty is my favourite band. After listening to this album, can you blame me? This was MBT's debut and it is absolutely flawless. Rob's voice is rough with a hard twang and the overall sound of this album is gritty. That would drive a lot of people nuts, but it is perfect for this album.This album includes some of their biggest hits like ""Push"", ""Real World"", ""3 AM"", and ""Back 2 Good"". Anyone who lived in the 1990s remembers when Matchbox Twenty took over the world with these songs. They're just as good now as they were then. The album closes with ""Hang"", a heartfelt acoustic. It brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes gritty alternative music."
3,A good CD,"When I first heard the song ""Wanna push you around"" I thought I have to have this CD. But now that I have it I don't listen to it that much. It's not that it's a bad CD, but I just can't stand to listen to it for long periods of time."
5,This CD is the best in the '90s,"Matchbox 20's Cd, is so good, i bought it last March and i still continually listen to all the songs on it! All the songs have such a variety which makes it easier to listen to them all. The songs emotions range from angry to just plain excited! All of their songs tell a story, which is fantastic. The vocals are great! Its just a great album!!"
3,someone's jealous...,"To those of you bashing Rob Thomas, (and I am sure you are all male), I've got news for you... I am a 43-year old female with two daughters in college. We ALL think Rob Thomas has about the sexiest voice around. And ""Smooth"" is at the top of the charts because women LOVE that emotional, powerful voice of his! Yes, this is not the best CD, but give me Rob Thomas any day!"
3,Not my style,"This was the first CD I ever bought, so it has a bit of sentimental value attached to it, but that's about it. Now, I want to be fair--it's an okay album--if you like the Matchbox 20 style. I used to like it more a few years ago, but my tastes have changed since I bought it and I don't care for it much any more... When it all comes down to it, if you really like their radio singles, you'll probably like the album. If not, you're probably better off spending your money on something else."
2,yeeeeech,"I bought this CD for ten bucks off a friend. It got real, real dull after a while. If you buy it, which I'm sure that you will, regardless of what I think, don't listen to it more than once or twice a week. It gets old fast."
1,If a tree fell...,"Dear mr record executive:I know that at this point in time you may not be catering to my demographics (post-teenage), but please give me something I can listen to. I bought this disc on the good word of a friend who's word isn't so good anymore. I was told that it wasn't the typical 90's disc. That it wasn't a much tired ""Grunge"" crossover. Nor did it have a singer that sings like Elmer Fudd. He told me the songs didn't all sound like they were recorded in a plastic bag under the ocean in a hurricane. And speaking of horrific production I have this qustion for you. Why is it that in the 1990's we have made all these technologial advances in the music industry yet ""Sherryl Crow"" still sounds like she recorded her discs in the 60's? Can we move forward please?"
1,Uninspiring and Unimaginative,"I'm so glad I bought this cd used and didn't shell out twenty bucks on such a uninspiring cd that is called ""Yourself or Someone Like You"". Has rock and roll music been reduced to such bland, unimaginative dreck like Matchbox Twenty? My problems with this band is that their music offers nothing special to me. Rob Thomas's songwriting abilities is as average as the lead singer from Hootie and the Blowfish. The songs may be catchy but not enough to convince me enough that they are anything special. I may dislike teen pop and rap/rock but it is bands such as Matchbox Twenty that I can't stand the most. This band can't be anymore banal, white bread, average and dull as they already are. I'm sorry I own this cd."
1,Please read this all of you people who actully like MB20,"I really liked Matchbox 20 three years ago, but hear latey I really have started to hate them. I like there songs Back to Good Push and Real World but all of there other songs are pretty bad. Also, they show that they don't really care about there fans since they are taking so long in releasing another album. It don't take three year the make an album. If they keep up at these rate then they will have like four albums by the time they are 50. Maybe they have ran out of song ideas. I don't know. During these time of waiting I have found a really good band Collective Soul. They have a really good cd ""Dosage"" so check it out if you are sick of waiting on Matchbox 20 too.(Oh, and next time guys, turn up the guitars some. They are very weak.)"
1,shiver me timbers,Matchbox 20 continues to commit unforgiveable crimes against nature and humanity. And the radio stations that continue to flood the air waves with their vomitous radio friendly jingles deserve bankruptcy in the worst way. Please go away Matchbox 20. Please.
1,It's time for this album to walk the plank,"(I would have given this album no stars but I can't.) When Rob Thomas and his first-mates aren't singing yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum, these maritime mariners are crooning stories about staying up too late (3 in the am) and watching mtv (real world). The jangly compositions compliment their jangly jewelry and keep those on board this sinking ship anesthetized. This album is musically peg-legged and sure to drown. So please, if you don't want to end up in Davey Jones' locker with the crew from SS Matchbox 20, throw yourself overboard and don't buy this record."
1,No stars,"This is the most disposable ""rock"" band out there. And that's saying a lot considering it has Tonic and 3rd Eye Blind, Our Lady Peace and such and such to content with. In fact, you could probably interchange songs by these 4 bands and not know the difference. The state of rock music is on it's way down when people are buying into albums like this. It's very suffocating music. Keep away from these boys who are devoid of talent and originality."
1,Matchbox 20 smells.,"Matchbox 20 stinks. Why? Because who the heck would come up with a asinine name like Matchbox 20, or a half-witted album name like Yourself or someone like you? I can only think of one type of person that would come with something that stupid; a pirate. Ah yes, after listening to the album, I concluded that the music was applesauce as Rob Thomas uses his constipated-like voice to make sounds. These pirate look-alikes are bound to hit rock bottom of the ocean."
2,Pretty cool cd,"I thought that this cd was pretty cool, but it gets annoying after awhile. I mean you hear the songs on the radio all of the time, and listening to them again gets on your nerves. The songs in the beginning are the best, especially ""Real World,"" and ""3 am."" If you like screaming, buy this cd."
3,Getting Old? Definately!,"I used to listen to MB20 ALL the time. They were my #1 group, I went to their concert and everything. I mean the songs were good but get old after listening to them so much. Real World was so over played and so was 3am. I think the cure would be to get a new c.d. out. I mean the c.d. does have some cool songs that haven't been worn out, like Busted and Cody. And I still like the #2 song (I forget it's name). So over all I think if you buy it you will be satisfied for maybe a month or two but then you will be ready for some new stuff. Maybe try some Green Day!"
2,This is considered Alternative?,"Since when is typical Top 40, radio friendly tripe considered alternative. Lumping this in with bands like Pearl Jam, Offspring, Nirvana and many other great ALTERNATIVE groups is insulting. Sure, some of the songs are alright on first listen, but it takes about 3 plays to get sick of the songs. Of the 30 million that bought this CD(impressive if I do say!), how many are played regularly still. 75% are probably used to level lopsided tables right now."
5,Great CD,I listen to all types of music from country to rap. I love this CD. I've lost it once and bought another one. I love every song on this CD. I have never loved a CD as much as I love this one.
4,A Whole Lot of Good,"This is a good album,with few songs that you skip.They eventually all grow on you and it turns into a really great CD.My favourite song is still Long Day,but Kody is just one of those songs.It has all the ingredients of a fantastic album, great vocals,deep lyrics and catchy riffs. I bought it years ago and will always like it,however,once you've had it for more than 2 or 3 years and you hear it,you want to chuck it away sometimes or swap it.Don't, cos one day when you've virtually forgotten all their first songs,you'll give it a listen and fall in love all over again.kadu81@hotmail.com"
3,Yawn...weak...,"Why did I buy this album again? Right, it's large amount of hit singles, most of them really unoriginal. Come on, I was raised in Florida, people, and you can find much better material from the state than this diamond-selling slosh. I found the singles okay, if a bit annoying after hearing them on the radio a million times, but, sadly, they're the best stuff on this album. ""Push"" is disappointing, disguised feminist nonsense, and the best tracks on this album are the juvinile ""Real World"" and the actually fine ""Back 2 Good."" ""3AM"" is okay, but one of the better songs on this album as well. It's good that with ""Bent"", from their next album, they seem to be advancing from this musically unexciting album...this is not southern rock at its finest, or even close, it's just mediocre..."
5,WOW what a Hit,This c-d is well worth the money and in my opinion deserves more credit than it has actually received all the way over the atlantic
4,One of the best new groups!,"""Yourself or Someone Like You"" was surprisingly good! I bought it because I liked the song ""Push"". The first five songs are really good, and the rest aren't anything to sneeze at, either. This is a good buy, I'd recommend it if you like the new age music, such as Third Eye Blind."
1,Music for the Tone-Deaf,"It is both amazing and sad what is passing for music these days. My 16-year-old cousin thinks this is the greatest band in the world. Oh my god...what a depressing thought that is.These guys are fronted by the most grating, annoying singer in recent memory. (Well, come to think of it, he sounds pretty much like a lot like the lead ""singers"" of many other lame-o bands out there like the Verve, the Verve Pipe, the Verve Tripe, etc.)All of the songs sound exactly the same. There is no imagination, no musical prowess (unless you like endless chord-bashing), no innovation, nothing. Nothing. Music by and for slackers!"
2,ROB THOMAS DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO WRITE GOOD LYRICS.,"This guy can't write good lyrics and he can't sing them either! Gives alternative rock a bad name. It's got some good songs on it, but they swear so much and insult God (In ""Long Day"": ""No, Lord, Your loving hand won't stop it, just keep You trembling.""), it only deserves two stars."
1,"Bad, Very Bad.","This Cd is very slow with there music witch is all the same, and boring with short titles."
1,Arrrrrrrrrrggggggghhhhhhhhh Mateys!!!!,Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. You'll definitely need the rum while listening to this CD. Rob Thomas and his merry band of Buccaneers called Matchbox 20 sailing the ship S.S. Yourself and Something Like You for the past 3 years. Basically I want to say we are tired of this album!! They have been living off of it for the past three years robbing us of our money like the pirates they pretend to be. This Cd is awful!! If the radio didn't play this to death nobody would ever buy it they'd be stuck playing their talentless garbage they call their music in in 3rd rate clubs to 10 peopole who aren't even listening. Stop buying this album and maybe they'll release a new one and bomb out of music forever!!
5,Every song is a good one!,"This is a great debut CD, you cannot go wrong with buying this, even 4 years after its release. Every song is good. I got into this CD when it first came out in '96, but got sick of it because of all the airplay. When Rob Thomas and Santana came out with ""Smooth"", I pulled out my Matchbox twenty CD and got reacquainted with all the songs, liking it even better the second time around. ""Push"" is a classic song, and if your looking for a song that was never on the radio, try ""Hang"", a great ballad about breaking up. This is a must have for any collection."
4,great 90s rock,"This cd is one of the best rock CDs i've ever bought, Titles such as 3 AM, PUSH and REAL WORLD have topped the US charts for more than expected.It has been a multi-platinum record selling album. The music in the Album is one of a kind. the lyrics are meaningful and heartfelt. the beats and ryhthms are catchy. Buy this CD if you are interested in great easy listening to Rock."
1,Can 10 million fans be wrong???,"I'm tempted to answer the above question with a resounding ""yes,"" having endured the facile sentiment and unimaginative arrangements of Matchbox 20 for the past 2-3 years. Reading the glowing 5-star reviews by Matchbox 20 fans has hardly convinced me of the merits of this band either, especially when the praise consists of such well-developed thoughts as ""The best CD I've ever listended too, even better then Third Eye Blind."" Crap like Matchbox 20, Goo Goo Dolls and Third Eye Blind are driving nails into the coffin of rock music. No wonder rap music is exploding in popularity - it is much more imaginative (Puff Daddy excepted) than the bland claptrap that oozes out of the rock radio airwaves these days."
1,I could always use another jewel case...,"What a piece of junk. Is this what American music has come to? Has the music scene gotten this bad? I would recommend getting a good album instead, like REM Up or something like that. These guys should give it up, take the money and run."
1,Another 3 Chord Band Becoming a 1 Hit Wonder,"Wow. A bunch of middle class white boys who know three chords. How original. How much talent they have. Seeing the crap like this and Turd Eye Blind is being called a great album makes me want to vomit. Compare this to a band with real musical talent, like Pink Floyd, Black 47, Bauhaus or Portishead, and you'll see that these talentless hacks are nothing."
1,Someone needs to take a match to this CD,"Whether it's lead singer Rob Thomas' annoying, look-at-me-I'm-young-hip-and-angst-ridden persona or the misogynistic lyrics of ""Push"", everything on ""Yourself or Someone Like You"" s***s. I firmly believe that the continuous play of the single ""Three A.M."" is responsible for 80% of the cases of road rage that have occured since it's release. Please, don't contribute to the decline of pop music by buying this hackneyed CD."
1,I'm sorry,Matchbox 20 is bad. Very bad.Accept my sincerest condolences if this is your favorite band.
1,Dont listen to these pre puberty toddlers,"Guyz, Girlz, this is madness. It is a whiny flaming gay guy, with 4th class musicians, what is all the hype 4? Real bands like sepultura, pantera and testament use real percussion and drums, this guy just does a 1-3 rimshot or a simple beat with no good fills. There is no good guitar, the reason you girlz are so turned on is because rob tomas sound emotional and caring. he is also gay. I hope this band is killed in a plane crash. By the way, i did not buy the cd, i just heard it ont the radio. Long live pantera, dismembered, entombed, slayer, metallica, nevermore, testament, sepultura, soulfly, dissection, possessed, and iced earth"
5,A fridge full of laughter,"The book is so good I'm surprised it wasn't written by an Italian. Mamma mia, che ridere! The author must have some Latin blood in him, like Francesca, the main character in the story. If my wife does the same things Francesca did with the photographer, I hope she too will meet Perry the Cleave (so he might even fix my fridge for free!). You out there, photographers and not, stay away from my wife... but not from this book! It is a must-read for anyone having a wife or a fridge (also for those being a wife or a fridge). I cannot recommend it more strongly from this far away. If you want a good laugh, while pondering at the profoundness of life, look no further. But if you saw ""The Bridges"" then not reading this book will make you miss out on a big slice of reality!"
2,Short battery life,"Being in the remodeling/handyman business, I use my Makita cordless nearly every day. The drill itself is almost indestructable. The batteries on the other hand leave much to be desired. I am on my 4th pair of batteries in just three years. The last set barely made 6 months before they quit holding charge. As they are now they may drive 4-6 screws before they quit.The majority of my tools are Makita, they are tough to beat. However, I am having a hard time justifying buying these batteries so often."
1,Poorest Battery Life of any MiMH Battery I've Had,"I'm NOT a contractor and use my Makita drill only periodically - no way close to contractor use - but still have gone through a couple batteries in a couple years. Love the power/weight ratio of the tools, but the batteries are lame , esp for NiMH's."
1,Short Life,"Two of these batteries came with the new Makita drill I purchased about three years ago. I immediately noticed that they didn't hold a charge for as long as my old 12v Makita batteries. Now, like someone else said, I can only drive five or six screws before the battery goes dead. Both of mine exhibit the same horrible service. I've never left them out in the cold and treated them as instructed. Very disappointed."
5,Replacement Battery Pod Works,"When I received my 1434 battery and read the packaging (Virgos always read the packaging), my DC1414 battery charger was not listed as one compatible with the 1434 battery. However, Makita assured me it was, so I opened the package, charged the battery, and hoooray! My Makita variable speed leaf blower is working like new."
5,Great OEM Battery!!!,"You can't go wrong when you buy OEM. These have been working great, in fact better than the original batteries that came with my Makita drill, so don't hesitate with this battery. One suggestion: always rotate your batteries. I know some technologies say batteries don't need to be discharged then recharged, but it's still a good practice. It prolongs the life of any battery, because the service life goes through less charging cycles. You should buy these if you need them, and don't worry about generics."
5,makita battery,"A pleasure to do business with Amazon.com . Battery expensive, but comparatively speaking, a good price on this site."
3,Mixed Review,I have owned my Makita Drill for about one year now. I have used it extensively for remodeling projects. I just ordered a replacement battery. Of my 2 original batteries one works great. It holds a charge longer than any battery tool that I have owned. The other battery is totally shot. When it comes fresh off the charger it will barely drive a screw. I have treated both of these batteries the same and always tried to take good care of them and make them last. No explanation why there is so much difference between 2 batteries.
3,barely worth it,I agree with other reviewers that these batteries have a short lifespan. They were hyped by the factory reps as being just the opposite. They are no better than the old nicad. I hope the electric car makers will be using superior technology to this lousy stuff.
3,Life could be better,"I love the quality of Makita tools overall and especially the power to weight ratio compared to other Pro tools. BUT, I also have had to replace this battery every 12-18 months, even cycling two batteries with moderate-light use as a homeowner."
4,14.4 Makita NiMH Battery,"The new battery works great, but the old NiCad Makita Charger (Mod.# DC1410), is not compatible with the new NiMH battery. Had to buy a new charger."
3,Store carefully,I purchased this battery as a replacement. I needed to replace batteries because I left the original batteries in my hot car while working at a remote job site. The result was high output impedance and insufficient torque to finish the job. New batteries cured the problem. More prudent behavior will prevent a recurrence.
3,Makita 2.6 Ah 14.4volt cordless tool batteries,"I recently bought a pair of these batteries to replace the original batteries which came with my Makita cordless drill/driver. I haven't got any complaints about the batteries but I do wish that there were more tools which I could use them in, besides the drill and a flashlight."
4,Pre-Foo Fighters Dave Grohl!,"The great thing about this CD isn't necessarily the Nirvana songs. Heart Shaped Box can be found on In Utero (a must buy), and can be heard in several different collections, live recordings, etc. The gem on this single is the song ""Marigold"", written and performed by Dave Grohl. Although technically a Nirvana song, Marigold is a good example of Dave Grohl's musical ability, and a soft, eerie sneak preview of the Foo Fighters to come. Buy it."
1,"""Don't Stay/Test Me""","Wow! The only Nirvana single to feature a David Ghrol original is Kurt Cobain's shining moment!And the lyics to Milk It actually are:""Don't Stay/Test Me"""
2,Nothing special,"Okay, the ratings for this product are stuffed with reviews from the spoken CD and from the novel itself. Obviously, those should be ignored - they were put out by the publishing company and they are only here to prop up the book's rating on Amazon. I have the hardcover edition. This novel is very ordinary. There is nothing wrong about writing about the ordinary lives of ordinary people, as long as it is well-written. This is not. There is plenty of setting description about the small town lifestyle in Vermont, but I found the sensory descriptions weren't especially vivid, even though they seem like they should be. And the characters weren't terribly well-developed either for me to care much about what happens to them. I do see that this is the author's first novel - so I suppose we should give him a break."
5,Big Hit,"My little Veggie Tale fans loved this collection. We've watched it countless times, and I love the moral and biblical lessons it provides. Well worth the price. You get 3 movies and 4 shorts in one pack. Big hit with all of my children, ages 7 and under."
4,All good except for 1,The one disc with the Larry Boy cartoons is very hard to sit thru. The villians are kinda demonic looking. Not as many veggies on the cartoon disc.
5,veggie tales- the bumblyburg superhero value 4- pack,i have always loved veggie tales but these 3 r my favorites. i liked them more then my kids do lol ty soo much for having them
1,Shocking unsuitable content for children,"I watched ""Dave and the Giant Pickle"" with my child. I was shocked by its political/religious content and would never show it to my child again. I was very disappointed that there was no disclosure on the DVD cover warning parents about the propaganda contained in the movie."
5,Money well spent!,"This collection has been on my 4-year old's list of favorites since it arrived five months ago. The good thing is, I enjoy watching them with her. Having the four CDs in one package, we have lots of enjoyment for a great price. Having the 2-D cartoons is nice, and it introduced us to new villains and new superheros. This is a fun way to teach or reinforce lessons about teamwork, egos, anger, and other subjects that help good kids grow up to be great adults. As the mother of a true VeggieTales fan, I must recommend this one!"
5,"Wow, What a Treat!","I couldn't find this set on Big Idea's web site, and was surprised to see such a thing existed here. A good collection, and a great price for it. Larry Boy is a mighty cute hero, and the video from The Fib from Outer Space is a treat."
5,LarryBoy is Our Hero!,My 2 1/2 year old son fell in love with LarryBoy so this four pack was a must. He loves it.
5,Veggies R Great!,"Veggie Tales are fantastic, but the price was phenomenal. I've referred friends, the price is too good to keep a secret."
5,Typically great Veggietales videos,This set of videos are typical of the great work that Veggietales does. Having all the DVDs in one set is really convient and the price is great. Larryboy is a superhero I want my kids to watch!
1,Zero Stars but they make you pick one,I ordered a cordless mini mouse. What I received was a surge protector. This was supposed to be a present for my mom.
3,Good,"I expected more of this CD. Some songs are good for dance but not all of disc. I understand that today some music is different that years ago. However, is good."
2,"Too Quiet, Even for a Dentist","I'm a smooth jazz fan, and love the formula over the past decade or so--the sounds of a sweet sax to the beat of an old R&B; song. More recent Brian Culbertson CD's follow this formula, but this CD is so caught up in the ""Quiet Storm"" motif that I longed for the ""storm""--this CD is all about the ""quiet.""First of all, there is not a single song with a discernable beat.Second, many of the songs are so self absorbed they have ""introductions"" as a prelude to the song. Dude, just play the song, I'm not impressed by titles and labels.I would pass on this CD. Brian Culbertson has some excellent CD's and tracks--but this isn't one of them. Unless of course you are a dentist--you might find the CD useful."
5,adult pop with sultry torch singer vocals,"Los Angeles resident Katrina Parker has the most amazing voice, and plays the piano like a fallen angel. Here she has assembled a collection of ""broken but hopeful"" songs which demonstrate that she belongs in the company of today's best female singer / songwriters. Visit her myspace page and listen for yourself, or just buy this little gem already."
5,Definately NOT a cover version!,"I'm a bit of a traditionalist, I think the original versions of films, songs and musicals should be left alone. Obviously I'm totally converted now! Not only cause the original cast album was a bit old and scratchy but the singing on it seemed so precise and unfeeling, like a singing lesson. This broadway version is just unspeakably outstanding!! Each and every character comes through just on the soundtrack it makes you wish you'd seen the actual show. (ok so I was only 9 at the time!!) Obviously like every other person in the world I was in Guys and Dolls at school which means I really wish I could have sang like Josie de Guzman or Faith Prince instead of the awful squwaking my fellow chorus members were subjected to!! Also, who could have guessed that the coma guy in ""while you were sleeping"" could sing so wonderfully? Go buy it! It's a no risk purchase cause if you don't like it you must be insane and therefore losing a few quid is the least of your worries!!"
2,Mediocre performances of great music - get the vinal,"Our family fell in love with the Frank Sinatra / Marlon Brando movie of Guys and Dolls. Imagine our delight when we found the CD. Imagine the looks around the dinner table when even our four-year-old said ""This isn't as good as the movie, is it?"" In fact, after hearing the movie, it's almost unlistenable. We did unearth an old scratchy copy of the vinal record from the 1950's, and though it's not as good as the movie, it's very close, and it blows the doors off of the CD."
3,If you loved the Movie -- YOU WON'T GET ADELAIDE,"Sorry, I didn't get to see the Broadway show. I really loved the movie --Frank Sinatra & Stubby Kaye are spectacular. Brando can't sing, but tries to sing and dance. One of my favorite songs NOT AVAILABLE ON THE BROADWAY ALBUM is ""Adelaide"" ... is taking a chance on me. That was disappointing.Love Nathan Lane generally, but he just brought a new and satirical twist, Gallagher is OK - sounds very voice trained Broadway singers.When you start with the movie -- the music from Broadway is disappointing.Sure you get ""Marry the Man Today"", but ""Adelaide"" will be missed."
2,Las Vegas meets Broadway: a slick lounge act,The style is smarmy and over-produced lacking the tightness and character Runyon intended. You can almost visualize the cigarette haze and bored showgirls of Las Vegas with every musical number. Old Broadway types may like this CD but anyone under the age of 50 will probably be nauseated.
2,Adequate at Best,"A long-time fan of ""Guys and Dolls"", I found the recording of the 1992 revival to be something of a let-down. While Nathan Lane is great as Nathan Detroit and Faith Prince is divine as Miss Adelaide, the rest of the cast is a surprising disappointment. In particular, Walter Bobbie is an absolute let-down as Nicely-Nicely Johnson -- his delivery on ""Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat"" is anti-climactic with a far-too-fast tempo and a less-than-stellar singing voice.The only real thing this album has going for it is to hear Faith Prince's superb ""Adelaide's Lament."" If you can only afford one ""Guys and Dolls"" recording for your collection, my recommendation is the all African-American revival recording from the 1970s, starring Robert Guillaume as Sky Masterson and a rapturous Ken Page as Nicely-Nicely Johnson."
2,Product was good but service was poor.,I was very disappointed. It took almost 2 weeks from the time I ordered the cd until I received it.
2,Lifeless,"My only real frame of reference is the movie with Sinatra and Brando. Maybe not the best to campare with, even so I have to say that, with the exception of Nathan Lane and Faith Prince, the performances on the CD lacked the life I would have expected. Maybe it's the effect he was going for as the suave, worldly gambler, but Peter Gallagher's Sky Masterson just came across as bored. His voice was also not the quality I would have expected from a Broadway-caliber performer. I almost hate to admit it, but I even prefer Brando's rendition of ""Luck be a Lady"" over the one on this CD. The movie version of ""Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat"" was also far superior. Some of ""Sky's"" songs (complete songs, not snippets/samples) can also be found at Peter Gallagher's web site.I found the CD at my local library, so I avoided having to pay for the disappointment. I would recommend you try to borrow a copy before deciding whether it's actually worth buying."
2,Go for the 1950s version if you like the movie,"Love the movie, loved the play in Washington with Maurice Hines as Nathan Detroit. This 1992 version is lifeless, in my book. The spoken parts on this CD seem wooden (and not in the gloriosly stilted manner of Damon Runyon's characters--just flat) and the songs lack punch. For my tastes, Sanatra (in the movie) was the ultimate sad sack Nathan Detroit, while NO ONE beats Stubby Kaye (original Broadway play and movie) as Nicely Nicely Johnson."
1,dissappointed,i was very disappointed in the car charger it did not work at all and the other one that i bought had a short in the wires and then eventually broke after a weeks time
2,Why is this named for Montauk??,"Nice pictures but has not much at all to do with Montauk NY except for a few shots of local landmarks, the majority of the book is basically a teen clothing catalog,pretty people scantily clad,not much to taking pictures of beautiful 22 year olds?? Very disappointed using the name Montauk because there is too much natural beauty in this place to waste it on a book of pretty people that could be on any beach."
5,Excellent Meat Tenderizer,"It took me a long time to find a metal meat tenderizer to replace my wooden one that I had decided to discard because I couldn't sanitize it in the dishwasher. After trying out a few different ones, I chose this Henckels Euro Meat Tenderizer. It is weighted just right, and I am able to pound out meats to proper thinness quickly without losing my grip."
2,Good production...Same old music tempo and movements...,Pros:Very quality production and presentation.Pretty clear instructions that go with the flow.Very pretty and professional costuming that doesn't obstruct the movement and present well and feminine.Clearly very much sweat and hard work has been poured into the making. Kudos for all.Dancers are really good in executing the movements.Cons:Poor workout efficiency: I don't see how someone would gain cardio+muscle strengthening from this level of work.The music are very similar in all 8 workouts.The tempo never really picks up.The movements never really pick up to pump your heart.Very similar feet and isolational movements are used which gets boring after a while. It may be some value if you are learning some combinations as a dancer.Not so much different than their previous DVDs... :(
5,not kidding -its hard,"Having bought all of Neon's pretty ""flow dance"" videos this is most definately the top of the cake for challenge"
2,Quite a disappointment,"The Chicago Symphony Chorus is famous for its excellence. Former chorusmaster Margaret Hillis was truly one of the greatest choral conductors of our time. She was a taskmaster, demanding precision and perfection, which she usually received. I counted myself lucky to sing a local ""Messiah"" concert under her direction a few years ago. What a tremendous experience to learn from this master. Imagine my disappointment when I bought this cd of Brahms' choral gem. The choral singing is incredibly insensitive. It's more of a scream-fest than a requiem. The only redeeming factor is the solo work. Kathleen Battle shines in this chestnut for sopranos. The sound is thrilling: clear and expressive. She spins a line of gold. For a satisfying listening experience of this work, I resort to Shaw's recording with the Atlanta Symphony and Chorus. Sadly, the solo work is not on the same level as the choral singing! If only we could merge the Chicago solo work with the Atlanta recording!"
3,If you really like Kathleen Battle,"This is not athe most inspired recording of Brahms' Requiem. Kathleen Battle is great here. So,if you like her then it's worth it. Ms. Battle really shines here!!!Of course the recording is not based around her... so we have a mediocre performance bordering boring.....Good Luck!!"
3,If you really like Kathleen Battle,"This is not athe most inspired recording of Brahms' Requiem. Kathleen Battle is great here. So,if you like her then it's worth it. Ms. Battle really shines here!Of course the recording is not based around her... so we have a mediocre performance bordering boring.....Good Luck!!"
4,IT is a big and nice book,it is like a dictionary and you can find every ship you want to know in this book
3,Confusing Mistakes,"While this book holds a wealth of information presented in a humerous and fun manner, it also contradicts itself on how to calculate important numbers. (see pp. 296-297 vs. the orange insert on figuring challenge numbers for one example) I found this very confusing. Perhaps a revised version is called for?"
5,Numerology is Awesome,"I read this book in a matter of days, it was great, I figured out my numerology as well as several others. This is the best beginners book to numerology ever! It was so easy to use and understand. I am very glad I decided to purchase this instead of having some new age-y numerologist make me a report, now I can make my own. Thanks!!"
4,Fascinating book,"I love this book. However, in the first edition of this same title, the characteristics of each number are listed, both positive and negative. This book would be better if it also had lists. A friend of mine has the first edition, which I was unable to get as it's out of print."
5,Alexandra [...],"This is the first numerology book I've purchased and it was very useful! It is very easy reading (hence the title ""the IDIOT's guide . . . "") and I was able to get a lot of information on different areas of my life. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it went in to a lot more detail than just a simple 2 sentence-long definition of each number. Instead, the book included references to the tarot, and how each number affects different parts of your life. There's a chart included in the back of the book for keywords about each number. If you are new to numerology like I am, I highly recommend this book. One more interesting note to point out before I end this, the book was dead-on about me and my numbers. My family, however, didn't experience the same thing. Some parts were ""on"" and some weren't. The book worked for me though so I really enjoyed it."
4,Looking for a Word from God?,"If youve found yourself in the wilderness waiting for a word from God, you may find His special message for you within this unique book. Believing the Bible is a ""love letter from God to His people,"" Cloninger has dramatically personalized and paraphrased key portions of Gods Word and placed them in the context of a poignant postcard from the Father. Each of the 60 readings is preceded by the Scriptural inspiration, assuring accuracy to Gods original intent. At times when your walk is so weary that reading more than a few words seems an impossible task, one of these brief readings will provide an overwhelming reminder of Gods intimate love. Word Publishing has also packaged the book as a spiral desk calendar, with perforated postcards that you can actually send to a friend who needs a word of encouragement."
5,Richell Pet Spindle Bed,"I obtained this pet bed for my friend Molly, who is a sweet little kitty cat, and she loves it! The pet bed looks gorgeous in the office room! It was easy to build, and it is sturdy. I can't get over the impressive quality of this pet bed. It is a great acquisition for the home, and it makes Molly very happy."
4,Nice grass,"If your looking for straight traditional bluegrass this may not be the CD for you. If you like a mix of traditional and modern you'll enjoy the toe tapping tunes with Danny and his friends have created. Good players and tunes. Not all hits, some fillers but for the most part it's a great CD with great players. I listen to it often."
1,Don't get this.,This pin holder can maybe hold 20 pins before they start to fall off. I'm currently looking for something better.
3,"Weak, but does its job","I originally got this because I've always used pins straight from the box, not a pin cushion, but those were always a mess and would fall over, etc. I was hoping to replace my box with this magnetic pin cushion, but the magnet isn't strong enough to hold all the pins in one of those little boxes they come in. However, it still works well with a lesser amount of pins."
3,Magnetic Pin Cushion,This is much lighter than I expected-- although it is exactly as advertised. It will probably be on the floor more often than not. It is just that I am used to the heaver mag. pin cushions.
5,Easy to use,"It was easy to use, I put it next to my machine and it was easier to drop the pins to the magnet than to look over to make sure I made it into the box."
4,Rhythm & Energy,"I just returned from Venezuela a few weeks ago and set out to find some recordings that would approximate the amazing music I heard while visiting. So far I've come up with this album and ""Music From the Orinoco River"" by Cheo Hurtado. I usually don't purchase CD's anymore unless I can hear them first, however this album was an exception because I was so impressed with Hurtado's solo cuatro playing (from the album above). Gerson Garcia is absolute virtouso on the bandola. Not much more needs to be said. The hemiolic rhythm flows effortlessly between 2s, 3s, 4s and groupings of 6 while continuing to drive forward. The only down side to the album is the relatively narrow spectrum of tempi and instrumentation. (Bandola, Cuatro, Maracas) Nevertheless, every single robust track is packed with drive and unflinching energy."
1,A good book BUT....,"This book is an excellent source for the CISSP exam and any one interested in computer security BUT it has problems. I gave it a one star because of the way it is poorly written. The errors in the book are too numerous to count and the formatting of the book makes it hard to read. I hope the next version some one will proof read it for grammical and content errors. In one page alone I found 6 glaring grammical errors. In several cases the graphics are so messed up they are hard to follow. I believe the part on firewalls was not even check for errors.Even though this book was hard to read, I still got a lot out of it."
2,More errors than any English book I have ever read!,"I think the content is OK BUT there are numerous errors, even typos, through out the book. The editors simply hadn't done their job. Why didn't they use any spell-checker?!"
2,Jumbo English-Thai Dictionary,"I took a chance and ordered the as yet unreviewed Jumbo Thai dictionary. My Thai friend and I were both pleased with it and conversing well, until I wanted to know the Thai word for truth. I then realized that 17 pages were missing from the book. Other than that obviously unacceptable flaw, it seems to be a great resource for someone just beginning to learn Thai. The online catalogue gives no info about the book so I'll supply some: More than 10,000 useful words, (maybe less in mine) and phrases, shown in English-phonetic pronunciation and in actual Thai-language writing. I was worried that it might be too large to be practical but it is similar in size to most soft cover dictionaries. The copyright date is 1997."
4,Jumbo,This dictionary is an excellent dictionary as far as it goes and in my copy there does not seem to be any missing pages. I would prefer the tones to be represented at the end of the word and have employed this in my language studio with students who seem to find this more comfortable.What a pity there is no JUMBO Thai-English dictionary. If anyone knows of a Thai-English dictionary with transcription of Thai characters into Latin letters I would love to know. Perhaps Jumbo does one?
3,"If you want a product to last a lifetime, this is NOT for you","I have really enjoyed using this timer, regardless of the fact that it rings before it should. It's been really practical for me to have two alarms on one timer. However, in my opinion, a product like this should last forever. There is no reason why it shouldn't. Mine lasted just over seven years, and now the only option is to throw it in the garbage where it will go to some landfill. Only because of this, I cannot recommend this product."
3,Great timer - if you know someone who can fix it,"I LIKE that the timer goes off BEFORE the actual time has elapsed. That way, I have a minute (or 30 seconds for the 20-min timer) to get to the oven and take out my cookies (or whatever). Once I understood how this early-warning system works, I came to appreciate it very much. I also like the two-timers-in-one approach. The timer is solid and looks great on my counter.2011 Update: Uh-oh. The bell stopped ringing. Fortunately, I have a handy husband. He took it apart and fixed it. See his review below. Unless you have a Tool Guy/Gal in the house, you can count on this timer only lasting a couple of years. I'm dropping my rating from five to three stars."
1,attractive-looking piece of junk!,"I was drawn to this timer because of it's somewhat retro, stylistic look. Unfortunately, only one of the timers on it worked. After reading ratings in Cook's Illustrated, I have decided to go with a digital readout thermometer which they recommend. Save your money and get a digital timer!"
2,"looks okay, but defective","To my disappointment, this attractive timer doesn't work reliably. I'm hoping I have a bad one and can get it exchanged, but I do advise testing both timers several times and using it for a few weeks before discarding the return form."
3,"amco two timer,nickelAmazon","Got this timer a while ago and did not want to be negative, but the timer does not ring at the end of the time cycle, disappointed as I had another one years ago, but one of the timers, as there are two, sprung a spring and does not work."
3,Fine timer but doesn't last,"I just bought another of these. We like the analog double timer and they just seem to work for us. That is until they don't. After 4 or 5 years both timers stopped dinging with in a month or less of each other. I couldn't find a better one so we replaced it. By the way, the picture is not correct. They've changed it so it's all ""nickle"" it used to be mostly black as the picture shows. Not a big problem just a difference. Finally, we rarely have to wind it more than to the time we want, maybe a little over winding but not even a full turn."
2,Book review,This will be a gift . I was a little disappointed in the size and content of the book. Also I thought it was way over priced. On the sleeve of the book it was #30.00 and I paid over #100.00 for it. I will let you know what the gift receiver says.
2,flaking,Not what I had expected for the price. I think that I feel better about using the $.99 plastic scoop. The coating has been flaking off since receiving the scoop. It was a gift that I would like to return or exchange.
3,Decent CD,Definetly far away from trash. I like this CD but i have to give bias to the first 2. Its a good touch putting superstars like Corinne Bailey Rae to balance things out and its fly.. but I don't see how she gives compliment to the Afrique part of the CD.... shes from England by the way (Had to wiki it before getting E-Kicked for ignorance) Still not worth a bootleg... buy it Amazoners.
3,Good starters guide,"We used this book for manual muscle testing and it gave the basics, but had bad stabilization of the patient. We ended up changing a lot of what the book said. It does have thorough information on muscle actions and innervations."
3,Complete guide to muscle testing,"The format is user friendly and the information is complete (although my teacher disagrees with some of the details.) The DVD woudn't load on my iMac, but others had no trouble and found it helpful."
5,Delivered as expected,I needed this book for school. It came within two days and was brand new. Couldn't be happier.
1,Background noise,"This would be a great set of CDs if only someone had removed the loud background hiss from these recordings. If you don't wish to hear the loudest ""tape hiss"" you can imagine hearing, do not purchase this set of CDs. The CDs are recorded in monaural sound as well."
4,Fun little combat system,"I had just spent the last two years discovering that there was something really odd about the way the D&D game system worked, and in particular its combat system. Then Metagaming published Melee. Melee is a simple, fast and fun arena combat game system. Players are given rules to create and equip fighters and send them out to fight in a variety of situations (though the players would need to design, or buy, most of them). It soon became something to do at school during lunch and as a replacement for the system of other RPGames. It is not the last word in simulation detail, or even realism, but works well."
1,design and build,I was disappointed in this book because there is a serious lack of view information and the cost is way over what it is worth. I will not buy any other books by this author since I believe it is a scam.Blaine
3,"a MIXED BAG, er... BOX, of Gospel Tunes","Discs 1 and 2 of this wide-ranging box set are just what I expected; classical ""soul"" gospel music. Much of it was new to my ears, and my ears liked it! By contrast, (in my opinion) the third disc would be better classified as ""contemporary Christian"" music - heavy on the artificial piano synth sounds, rather than Hammond organ and tambourine. A little too ""smooth"" for my personal taste - I would prefer more of that shoutin' music, as on 1 and 2! The box (designed to look like a bible) and accompanying booklet are clever!"
1,The first edition is much better,"The *first* edition is an excellent text ; a bible, right up there with Horowitz & Hill's ""Art of Electronics"". This edition is an apparently unauthorized, butchered, ripoff of the first. The added material due to the new author (Sieger)is certainly not of the same quality. Buy the first edition (new or used), and know you're getting an indispensible book to the credit of the real, *original* authors, Joe Jones, and Anita Flynn."
3,The Director of the MIT AL Lab has this to say...,"If you look at his FAQ page Rodney Brooks the MIT AI Lab director says that ""However, I do not recommend the second edition. It has an inaccurate list of authors and contains many errors."" This is the guy that taught the guys that wrote the book. You milage may vary..."
5,A must have book for Hobby Roboticists,"If you're thinking about building robots for fun and pleasure (the autonomous kind, not the battling kind) then this is the first book you should buy. It covers all of the basics and gives completely worked examples.Once you've mastered this book you will be well on your way to building robots that will amaze your friends, enchant kids of all ages, and reward you with hours of entertainment. There is no greater ice breaker at a party today than, ""The first robot I built had some really interesting attributes..."""
4,Good Investment,Purchased to use with my Garmin GPS w/Sat radio. Love the range of frequencies - you can always find an available channel to use unlike my previous unit that only had about 4 frequencies. Interface could be better - hard to see channels when plugged into cig lighter receptacle - have to bend over to see which means you have to pull off road. Otherwise - good stuff!
1,bad frequency!,it worked fine the first two times i used it after that it would shut down for 10 to 15 seconds and start working again a minute later the same thing over and over
2,works OK but audio quality poor,"This item works and is easy to use however I was somewhat disappointed in the music quality. Sometimes it is OK but most of the time the audio quality is so bad I have turn it off.In defense of the product I am picky about sound quality, however my Saab radio makes it extremely difficult to integrate an iPod into the stereo so I thought this might be a solution. If you don't care about the sound quality it will be fine, else find a way to integrate the player directly."
4,Very convenient,"Works very well. We have four TVs running off one Channel Master over-the-air DVR and antenna. We don't mind having every TV in the house play the same channel as we rarely have them all on at the same time. I put one of these with each TV (basement, upstair bedroom, kitchen, and family room) and they do a great job. Sometimes I'll have to punch a button twice, but it's usually pretty responsive."
3,reveiw of Escali large display bathroom scale,"THE FIRST SCALE i RECEIVED DID NOT COME ON UNLESS YOU LIFTED THE SIDE AND THEN DROPPED IT. i SENT IT BACK AND GOT ANOTHER WHICH SEEMS TO WORK, i like the big numbers on the readout. I don't like the size of the platform. Very hard to be steady on."
1,Reading was off,I had to send this scale back since the reading was quite a bit off. I doubled checked my weight with two of my doctor's scales...
4,Good Scale,I have only been using it for the past few days. I find it highly accurate though. For a big guy like me it was hard to find a scale that would read over 300. Being just shy over that I would need something better. I will update this review if I find I have any trouble over the next few months.
3,Non-flat surface,"Positive features include the large display, light weight of the scale, and high weight measuring capacity. Negative features include a somewhat small width and converse surface, making it difficult for a steady stance while on the scale, which was slow to respond with the weight. Returned this item.Made in China."
3,great when it works,"I deleted an earlier glowing review because like another reviewer, this unit stopped working in six months. While it worked, it was great. Easy to use, repeatable and with a great display. It actually stopped working after a month, but I opened it up and found a lose wire, soldered it and forgave it. But six months later, I could only get it started by reinserting the batteries, I can no longer give it a good review. Its internal construction is chinsy and the case is thin plastic. However, it was so much of what I wanted, I ordered another. If the next one fails, I'll have to find one less enjoyable but more reliable."
5,Excellent scale,"I had to return one scale because it didn't register the initial 00's. The second scale - BTW the return was handled excellently - works perfectly. It is accurate and has large numerals easy for me to read, even with my defective vision. It holds the weight for a few seconds after you get off the scale, so you can catch the reading. I would buy the same scale again - and the price is right."
2,Escali High Capacity Large Display Bathroom Scale (400lb/180kg) Review,This scale is just okay. I don't like the way the display gets stuck because the person may be extra big weighted and I have had to work with the battery section to get the display to be unstuck. It is so irritating.
1,This scale is a piece of trash!!,"If I could give this scale a negative number that would be better. My boyfriend bought this for us a couple months ago and it does not work at all. When you step on it, it gives you some random weight or will just keep counting down to zero. I am very unhappy with this product and I WOULD NOT TELL ANYONE TO BUY IT EITHER, SAVE YOUR MONEY HERE AND GET SOMETHING GOOD!!!!"
4,Scales,"These scales are the third set I have bought to weigh myself. I am a big guy (360) & these are the first that will weigh me the same two times in a row. Yes, they do kind of have a small space to stand on but I believe it makes them more accurate. If you weigh too much in pounds you can always switch them to kilos & weigh half as much! The other scales I tried would not weigh the same twice in a row & they sounded like they were breaking to pieces when I stepped on them.If your big like me I can recommend these scales."
3,slope,"The scale is attractive and consistent in the weight it shows. Also it has very large numbers. These are two of the reasons that I purchased the scale and are positive attributes.HOWEVER, I AM A LARGE MAN AND THE SURFACE OF THE SCAlE IS SLOPED TO THE SIDES. I HAVE TO USE MY CANE TO KEEP FROM SLIDING OFF (THE SCALE HAS A NON SLIP SURFACE WHICH SHOULD HOLD FOR UNDER 250 LB)."
4,Bathroom scales,"Scales were as described. Very large dislay, and seems to be accurate as compared by another set of scales. Would recommend to others. Locks in the weight for about 5 seconds after stepping off scales, for those with low vision or those with big bellies that you can't see over."
4,Seems accurate,"I am very happy with this scale. It gives the same reading no matter how often you step on and off. The last electronic scale I had required numerous weighings until you got the same reading at least three times in a row. I've checked it against my doctor's scales, and it is within one pound of his. The reason I didn't give it five stars is because of it's slightly slippery and rounded surface. I don't really feel unsafe using it, just a bit uncomfortable."
4,Escali High Capacity Bathroom Scale,"This scale has some great features including a huge display panel that is very easy to see, a large enough platform on which to stand comfortably (even for big-footed critters such as myself!), and a surface that is easy to keep clean. My only complaint is that the batteries don't last very long. There are two of us who hop on and off the scale each day but the batteries had to be replaced within 7 weeks.Escali High Capacity Large Display Bathroom Scale (400lb/180kg)"
4,Excellent Book to Read to your Class,"I currently teach first grade. I was looking for a book that was something I could read to the class that had chapters. I found Danger Guys and was pleasantly surprised to see how well it worked as a read-out-loud book. There are lots of sound effects and action that keep first graders interested. They have begged me to read them the next books in the series, because they got very attached to the characters Zeek and Noodle. Over-all, its a very good book."
2,1st graders will miss the weaknesses of the book,"A good children's book should be, to some degree, rewarding and enjoyable to children and adult readers. This one wasn't. It reads like a story being made up as it's told with the pieces not well thought out. It's good practice for the beginning reader but there are many series of better quality."
3,Detailed and a fun read.,"On a technical note, the author needs a spell check and to have syntax checked in this book. It may have been translated incorrectly.The history of the planes and missions was interesting to read. The history is not as in depth as in other books of this genre, but the author seems genuinely interested in this topic."
3,Wings of the CIA,"""Wings of the CIA"" has good untold stories and rare photos, but Frederic Lert needs to work on his English literature mechanics. It comes across as lack of Aviation knowledge."
5,IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE GREAT S.R.V.,"listen guys stop buying crap like Johnny Lang or Kenny Wayne Shepperd ,we are talking about a real blues guitarist here ."
2,1 track wonder,"Scott Henderson is a phenomenal guitar player, however, a blues songwriter he is not.The opening track, a funky bluey instrumental, is a grooving masterpiece of dynamics, phrasing & just all out guitar cool.The solo is one of my favourites of all time.The rest of the album is incredibly unlistenable.Super hokey ""blues"" songs that sound like some burned out session musician penned junk ie. souless & empty.Sure the performances are clean & Henderson pulls out some cool guitar moments, but whatever. it's dreck.The opener is the bomb tho..."
5,So glad I could get this!,"The book was a great purchase and arrived in perfect condition. It is well written, insightful, inspirational, and made you want to grow so much as an individual."
4,Insight,An excellent book with a surprisingly intimate view into the life of an amazing man. Shows what God can do when a man's heart is humble toward his Creator.
4,"Excellent product, excellent service",The Man Who Talks with the Flowers is amazing reading about a man who overcame racism by walking peacefully with God through the problems.As far as Amazon service is concerned - it is excellent - as ever.Sandra
5,Great read,Excellent book was very glad I made the purchase. Explains how God always listens and answers prayers in mighty ways
4,Useful for a special purpose,"The POWERMID works very well for the specified purpose. The transmitter gets the IR signal from the control and the receiver reproduces it in the remote location. The receiver must ""see"" the sensor of the equipment being controlled, but it works from a reasonably long distance and wide angle of view. I placed the receiver inconspicuously on a shelf 10 ft away, about 15 degrees above, and 75 degrees on the side from the satellite tuner and it worked perfectly. I bought this device to control from my bedroom a satellite receiver that was located in the living room. Because the receiver simply reproduces the IR signal that control sends to the transmitter, one can use it with any IR control. The only problem I experienced had nothing to do with the POWERMID: because the satellite control was multidevice, sometimes I inadvertently turned on the TV in the living room."
4,It's a very good book if your just begining.,"This is a very good book if you are just starting out. If you don't want to read alot and want to get started fast it's perfect. If you are a intermediate user, stay a away from this book it's not for you. Try Master Windows 95 Visual a much better book, if your an interediate user or higher."
2,USED FROM ACCESSORY ONE,"This is the actual battery from RIM Blackberry. This product works, but shows obvious signs of usage when purchased from Accessory One. It does not hold charges like a new battery, and thereby shows another sign of wear and tear."
1,Very Disappointed!,I have yet to receive the product via UPS . Very disappointed. Really needed the battery immediately. There is a ZERO rating.
1,This battery does not fit 8350 Curve. Its too big.,This battery does not fit 8350i Curve (it is listed as one of the compatible devices). Its too big. This battery does not fit 8350i Curve (it is listed as one of the compatible devices). Its too big.
4,Big,Very good product. Great price. But battery was a bit bigger than the original One. Need more force to move it in and out.
5,Blackberry Batteries,It arrived quicker than expected and it worked well. It was identical to those that came with my Blackberry phone.
4,"Engaging, memorable","Susan Carroll can write, and write well. If you're looking for depth, characters that really live and breathe for eachother and a stpry that twists ans turns until the last page, the Courtesan is for you. If you want a love that lives for more than the moment. For a story that you will carry inside for days after, than the Courtesan is a read not to miss. Though too wordy in some areas ( where are these author's editors??) the pacing is generally in keeping with the time period of the book, i.e. antique and medium paced. But that's a small thing, overlookable to be sure. A good here-comes-winter-and-I-need-an-engrossing-read book."
2,Very dissapointing read,"I love to read historical fiction but this was a real dissapointment. There was no flow to the story. It seemed all the love scenes which were far to many and all alike, were just tied together loosely with extra verbage. I would have liked to see the characters more fully developed. More of a modern romance type book set in another time setting."
5,RAVE REVIEW!!!,"I fell completely in love with the second novel by Susan Carrol in the Cheney Sisters Trilogy. Her use of imagery makes the reader feel as though they are experiencing every thing the characters are. She uses strong women as her main characters, and by the end the reader can't help but feel sympathy for even the villians of the story. In her novel Susan stresses that everyone is in control of their own lives and not mindless cratures bound to follow some destiny or path in the stars; that humans aren't meant to sit back and just let things happen, hoping all will play out as they wish. Her Characters take action, decisive or not. They don't fret and do nothing, but act, and live, and love."
2,Not Historical Fiction,"This book was recommended to me as ""historical fiction"". Fiction is a perfect description, but historical is but a loose term used to describe this book. The few chapters I could tolerate were well written, however, I felt deceived in that the book was described as historical fiction, and I expect with historical fiction that the story is based mostly on fact. As far as I know, there was no place called ""The Fair Isle"" where women lived as ""witches"", in this time period or any other. That is the stuff of Arthurian Legend, and I was not under the impression that this work of ""historical fiction"" had legend and lore included in it. I don't mean to nit pick, but I was expecting a work of fiction based on fact, not legend. If you are looking for a good novel based on fact, try Sharan Newman, Sharon Kay Penman or Ken Follet."
1,Pedestrian Novel,"This novel is engaging, I must admit; but as such an unchallenging read, it seems to have been written for thirteen year-olds. The writing does not flow well, and the author really struggles to get the novel started. As a college graduate, I am a bit embarassed at having read this book, which I only finished because I paid fourteen dollars for it. I agree with the previous review that suggested this book should NOT be categorized as an historical novel, but rather as a romance. Among those who may enjoy this book are women who read ""chic lit"" such as ""The Devil Wears Prada"" etc. Unstimulating, though somewhat interesting, similar to TV shows like ""Date my Mom"" and ""ElimaDate."""
4,If you like the first one. . .,If you enjoyed The Dark Queen you will enjoy this piece. I always seem to think the first one is best and hence the second installment is still wonderful and exciting. It still has adventure converged with a love story and a sense of healing. I love the themes of the book.
1,Boring,"After reading the first book in the trilogy and loving it, I eagerly started this one. It was so bad I read about 1/3 and haven't picked it up again."
3,not as great as i thought,"this is a good wind chime, but i thought it would be a GREAT wind chime. it's not as impressive as it looks in the photo. mine is on my front porch, it's not usually exactly level, and it doesn't spin often. it'd be a good buy if it was more like [dollar amount]. you can find a lot more jingle for your buck with another wind chime or at Target. i still like that it's red, and i'm not sorry i got it... but the spinning part just ain't there."
4,interesting and entertaining,I'm reading this book for a class. It is interesting and gives one much to think about.
5,Glorious,"Love the selections (with only a few exceptions, Dietz, Bernstein, Kern), love the performances. Some rarities."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!!!!,if you love reggae then this is a must have! steel pulse delivers the mellow style of reggae with some powerful lyrics. praise jah! - natty dreadlocks
4,A comeback album,"This is truely a comeback release for the group that was expected to carry the mantle after Bob Marley. They acknowledge in their prevoius releases that the drive towards commercialisation made them slip away from their leadership role in reggae but this album brings them back on tracks, the militant reggae style that prompted Bob Marley's ""endorsement""."
4,It's good...has all the hits plus some songs from the 90's...,"ABC was a guilty pleasure for me back in the 80's. Very stylish band with amazing production and strong hooks...sort of Roxy Music lite. They only toured twice, and this CD is from their second tour in 1997. It's good...has all the hits plus their songs from the 90's which were not as strong as the earlier hits, but not bad either."
3,Not Conjunto Bernal,"Consumer please be advised that the band on this cd is not Conjunto Bernal. The songs are interpreted by another band. Los Imperials do a nice job of playing their versions of Bernals songs, but are missing the vocal ranges, and the mariachi sound that, to me, made Bernal unique, and who they were. As for the song selection, it is a very nice compilation that includes Lo Lindo De Ti, Punalada Trapera, Buena Suerte, and one of my favorites- Destino Cruel. All-in-all, a good CD that I would purchase at a very reasonable price."
3,Graveyard Rats and others,"Howard sold these stories to the detective pulps, but there isnt much detectin' going on. With some minor changes the heros could be any of Howard's big beefy characters.All of the stories have some supernatural elements, african ju-ju men,or evil orential Fu Manchu types.""The Tombs Secret"" is pretty good,as not too many stories revolve around dental work. ""Graveyard Rats is fairly creepy, but the biggest mystery is what the title ""Fangs of Gold"" has to do with that story. The other four stories are pretty standard pulp fare. Howard's detective stories are hard to come by, so if you are a fan its worth it, even if its kind of pricey.If you are just getting interested in R.E.H., start elsewhere."
2,Not what you think,"When I ordered this, I thought it would be like an omnibus style of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, but it's not. There's no synopsis of each character, just basic stats and issue # reference of appearances."
4,whats old is new again!,this is a great book.it describes powers and history on most of the marvel characters and much more. the previous essential marvel handbooks were great to.if you are a marvel fan and want to know about your favorite character then this is for you.nuff said true believers!!!!!
2,It's in black and white,It's great that editions 1-7 are collected here but it would have been MUCH better if the illustrations were in color.
1,Should be prescription only.,This will chemically scorch the entire alimentary tract of your dog. You may have to treat with pro-biotic supplements for months after to cure the diarrhea . It will kill off healthy bacteria colonies necessary for normal digestion. Nutrition can not be derrived from food without bacteria colonies. I worked at a Vet Clinic when this first came out. If your pet has tape worms treat specifically for that alone. There are other wormers that are not as harsh on the dogs system. I accidently ingested a tiny amount of this. I cut the dose in half on a wooden chopping block and the next day residue still there got into food that I made for myself. This was like having labor pains all through my stomach and bowels for 2 days. After experiencing this- I threw the rest out.
1,bad!!!!,this almost made my dog die. i was iffy about buying this online but its the same thing my bet would give him... i have it to my dog... and i can swear we threw up everywhere the next day and started convolting.
1,Horrible!,"Not only did this product make my dog ill (vomiting, diarrhea, listlessness), but the worms came back within a month!"
5,Works like a charm,"My dog had tapeworm segments in his stool and my vet had a 2-week wait for an appointment. In that time I ordered this, gave him the full series, and had him fixed up. Definitely recommend if you're certain there are worms."
5,Great product,"I was concerned about my dog's health because he was having mucus every few weeks. I took him to the vet and they performed a fecal test but found no parasites. After another 3 months passed, I finally decided that I should buy a dewormer just to be on the safe side. It turned out that his problems went away after administering this medicine for 3 consecutive days. I strongly recommend this product if your dog has symptoms related to worms."
4,Panacur C Canine Dewormer 1 gram,Product worked well and easy to mix it with food for my dog. I will recommend use of this product if your dog has worms problem.
1,Powders Suck!,"this is difficult to mix, difficult to administer, just plain difficult.Next time, I used Horse paste. it is way better, just push and the dog likes it!"
1,HORRIBLE ALLERGIC REACTION TO PANACUR!!!,"We gave our 4 month old puppy this 3 day panacur dewormer given to us by our vet. Well the first day she was hyper, would not settle down at all, the second day worse, hyper-hyper-hyper, crying and would not; could not sleep at all, biting and biting her tail and acting crazy!!! Today I am about at my wits end with her and thank God it's her last day on it and am hoping the poor thing will now get a little rest and recover just fine. I have read online about loads of reactions the same as ours from this medication!! I know it only happens with some dogs, but I wanted to let everyone know so that if they have a sensitive dog like we unfortunately have, that they can choose something else!!"
3,Read the fine print before buying!,"Wish they had spelled out the dosage for my dog when I bought these. You need the 6 gram x3 dose for a dog around 55 lbs, not the 4grams that I ordered here! Not sure it worked since my dog avoided eating it in her food since it's a powder unfavored and she just ate around it and I had to reorder the rest of the dosage for my dog and this extended the 3-day dosage rule.So, it's cheaper than the vet route for de-worming but I can't say I know it works."
3,Dewormer,"The powder makes it interesting to use, but I mixed with peanut butter and my dog didn't hesitate. He was acting like he used to when he had hookworms, but after a couple of days he was back to normal, so I believe this stuff worked."
5,Great,"Excellant product for the money, my dogs Thank you and so do I . Just a good product, worked very well."
5,amazing,a puppy wandered in my yard and had a really bad case of ring worms. so i did some research and this had great reviews so i ordered it and while i was waiting on it i rubbed the puppy down with jock itch cream like the vet said. so when this came in i gave it to the puppy for 3 days like it said and the worms were gone within a week and i was able to find the puppy a great home.
3,Not too useful for fish,"Based on a recommendation as a cure for cammalanus worms in aquarium fish, I used some of this in my tank. Ended up killing a bunch of my fish. I'm not blaming the product for it, but just letting any future buyers know that this won't work."
5,Worming,Panacur dewormer was easy to put in our dogs food. And best of all...was the fact that there was no tummy upset for our dog. So no embaressing accidents!! Great product and will use again when nessasary! Thank You
4,Dragon,"Great looking case, nice and light. Also like the rpm fan readouts, and temp monitor readouts. The slide out motherboard tray is a +. Draws lots of compliments from everyone that has seen it. Found mine without the power supply, which was a plus for me, as I needed a high powered, power supply to run SLI. Bout a Corsair 620. For the average user the pwer supply that comes with most of these cases seen for sale is OK. I only wish it had 2, 120mm fans instead of 4, 80mm fans. Just a personal thing. The side port vent is nice."
1,Not available in Australia,I can't view this on my iPad and it is not supported in Australia!!! I hope I am not going to be charged the full subscription when my free month is up!! Not happy
5,Army Wives Season 5,Army Wives is my number favourite Show from a america! I cannot wait to see season 7 to start! Army wives is the best
5,Purchasing DVDs online,"Buying used DVDs is always a chance when you order online...one of the discs could be scratched or damaged, and nobody really wants to go thru the hassle of returning an item. In this case the DVDs were in excellent condition and we relied on the performance of the seller in previous transactions to make our decision to purchase. The product was delivered in a very timely manner and were exactly what we were seeking. Kudos to the seller and amazon for facilitating the purchase, we expected no less."
5,Army wives,I have not been disappointed in any of the Army Wives seasons! Can hardly wait for season 6 to come out.
4,Army Wives Season 5,I ordered the Army Wives Season 5 & was delivered sooner than expected which is always nice. However the first DVD would not play in my DVD player or my XBox and the only device that would play the first disc was my computer. During the second episode it would not play about a minute in the middle of the disc so I had to skip past that part. Other than that the DVD was package appropriatley and the rest of the set worked perfectly fine in my DVD player.
5,Love Army Wives! - Great Season - wish it was longer,"Love Army Wives! - Great Season - wish it was longerAlso love: Desperate House Wives, Grey's Anatomy, Lost, Damages"
1,I never ordered this.,"I never ordered this, so am confused as to why it is showing up that I did. Please look into this & let me know why."
4,Passionate rock opera with a Christmas theme,Enjoying much since my purchase three weeks ago. I plan to go ahead and buy the Orchestra's interpretation of Beethoven.
5,The best Christmas CD I have EVER heard.,"I had heard ""Sarajevo 12/24"" on the radio and instantly fell in love with it. This CD has it all...from the manic ""Mad Russian's Christmas"" to the heartbreaking ""Ornament"". Truly a modern classic. The blending of hard rock guitars with classical orchestration is phenomenal."
4,TSO=Christmas,Such a magnificent album. If you get a chance see them live or watch a DVD of their concerts..Classics and new songs in a whole new mix with electric guitars is perfect way to celebrate
2,Some good,"There are some good songs on it, but overall I didn't care for it. I like playing Cristmas cd's over and over, but not this one."
5,I love this music.,"I bought this CD to replace one I had lost. It just is not Christmas without the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Although used, the CD was in great condition."
2,TSO review,I was a little disappointed in that there too many vocals on the CD when I expected more intrumentals. Might recommend another CD by TSO.
2,Stick with instrumentals,"I've been a fan of TSO for a while, owning their Beethoven's Last Night CD and having heard their christmas music off and on for several years. I had read the reviews here, however, and listened to the CD with no expectations. What I heard was good instrumentals, but horrible vocals. The vocalists are trying very hard to sound operatic, and failing. The average punk band sounds better than the vocals on a few of the songs, which is a real shame consider the spectacular show that they put on live.To anyone who asks, I recommend going onto one of many sites where you can purchase individual songs, downloading all of TSO's instrumental songs from the three christmas CDs, and burning a CD with those. Save yourself the grief of the poor vocal performance and buy what's really worth listening to--rocking christmas music."
3,Not just instrumental...,"This is a wonderful CD for the holidays. However, I purchased this cd under the pretense that it was strictly instrumental; it is not. There are several songs on this album and they are somewhat disappointing. The singer's range and pitch take away from the enjoyment of the songs.It is unfortunate that this cd is not just instrumental pieces as they are the highlight of this album. This is the reason that this is a worth while cd. Besides, modern technology has provided us with the option to skip the songs that are not enjoyable."
2,Not what I expected!,"I was very disappointed after listening to the samples of this CD. I was looking for instrumental Christmas music. The samples with singing, just isn't what I was looking for."
1,As subtle as a freight train derailing into a brick wall,"I'm absolutely confounded by reviewers citing the ""amazing musicianship"" on this pretentious CD. These guys slam their way through an hour of agonizing, overly loud, and over produced noise. Each time they approach a subtle moment the guitar players make sure to crush it to death with overbearing metal riffs that were already long worn out in the 70's. If I could give this disc no stars I would. It is the most unfeeling and emotionless Christmas ""music"" I have ever heard. Save your money!"
1,Yuck!,"Listened to it once. I'm going to give it away as a White Elephant gift. Only a couple of songs were worth listening to. The rest were over-produced, contrite, boring, painful, or all of the above. Don't waste your money."
5,CHRISTMAS MUSIC LIKE YOU NEVER HEARD BEFORE,WHILE WORKING AT A CHRISTMAS CRAFT FAIR I HEARD AN INSTRUMENTAL VERSION OF O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL/O HOLY NIGHT . I ASKED ONE PERSON AFTER ANOTHER WHO WAS PLAYING THIS PHENOMINAL MUSIC. MY SON CHRIS CAME IN AND I ASED HIM IF HE KNEW WHO THE CREATOR OF THIS MASTERPIECE WAS. HE SAID HE THOUGHT IS WAS TRANS SIBERIAN ORCHESTRA. I WENT ONLINE AT AMAZON.COM TO SEE IF IT WAS THERE AND SURE ENOUGH I GOT TO LISTEN TO IT AND WAS THRILLED THAT I LOCATED THIS CLASSICAL ROCK GENRE. I HAVE SINCE PURCHASED EVERY CD THEY HAVE MADE AND HAVE NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED ABOUT SUCH A TALENTED GROUP. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO BUYING THEIR NEW CD NIGHT CASTLE. I HOPE TO SEE AND HEAR THEM NEXT TIME THEY ARE IN OR NEAR PENNSYLVANIA. GOD BLESS AND THANK YOU ALL AND KEEP US THIS MAGIC.
4,A Must Have Christmas cd!,If you love Trans Siberian Orchestra you'll love this cd but even if you don't know who they are this is a great place to start. You might find this one at your local library or might be able to listen to tracks here on Amazon.
5,My favorite of them all,"This is the first, and in my opinion, the BEST of the Christmas CD's. The Carol of the bells rendition is the most well known song they have, and The nutcracker medley is wonderful. I love the ending of the third song when there are two different sets of people singing, and how the first song is finished in ""an angel returned"" and the ""kyrie among nations"" at the end of an angel returned is really pretty. I had no idea until I saw them in concert that there was a story to the CD and how each song got its name, and now that I know, it makes the CD even better! If you can only get one of the CD's, this is the one to buy!"
5,Awesome music,"I am a huge fan of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. As somebody that enjoys both classical music and rock music, I would recommend it to anybody that likes either genre, and even to people that don't. I saw them in concert last year... The Flying V Electric Violin says it all. For year-round listening, check out Beethoven's Last Night. This music can be enjoyed by all. Both my 70 year old grandmother and I (21 year old guy) enjoy the music. You won't find too many bands that can please that kind of variety of people.By the way, why is everybody that dislikes the CD simply identified as ""A music fan"" and why do they all have the same pattern of speech?"
3,Music is wonderful,"The CD music is great, but took many (4) weeks to get. I feel like they recorded the CD for me, not sure why it took so long."
3,Christmas Eve and Other Stories,"I had heard so much about the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, but since I had not heard their music, I picked an album that was popular. The music was not what I had envisioned. It seemed to come across as though it was being played with anger. Christmas music is telling the story of the one who came to save the world out of love, not anger."
2,not for me,"It isn't that the music isn't good,it just isn't my style. I took a chance to see if I might like it. I am a traditionalist when it comes to Christmas. I will stick to Bing,Perry,and Percy!"
5,It rocks!,"This is one of my favorite CD's, and you don't have to listen to it just at Christmas. I especially like the instrumental songs, some of the vocals aren't my favorite, but it's still great!"
5,Unique Mix of Classics and Metal,"This is a great CD! I would recommend this to anyone who wants Christmas music with a little bite. Check out song 2 as a great example. I am not typically a big Christmas music fan or a big heavy metal fan. But, very surprisingly, these two go together well."
5,A full album of great christmas music.,"Nearly everyone is familiar with the Trans Siberian Orchestra rock medly of Christmas carols from Sarajevo 12/24, but the whole album is full of music that is equally as good if not better. Obviously a lot of talent was involved in writing and performing this music. This MP3 album is a great way to get a selection of TSO performances from a few different albums.The audio quality is what I would expect from an MP3. A more clear and full sound can probably be had from the ""hard copy"" CD, but for casual listen on most devices, this MP3 album is great."
1,"Sorry I bought it, big time!",Christmas music? You got to be kidding. Borrow this CD before you spend the money. I am sorry I bought it. Big disappointment I will pass it along to someone I do not like very much as a pre-opened gift. The samples provided on this web site do not allow one to hear a proper sampling. Someone with group must have written the high rating reviews.
1,Painful Noise - A Muscian's Opinion,"A co-worker let me listen to her copy of this cd. As soon as the electric guitars came crashing through and destroyed the beautiful sounds of the other instruments, I changed tracks. Give me traditional orchestra music. Music should ""soothe the saveage beast."" This ""music"" is not pleasing to my ears. I wouldn't waste my money to buy it. There were three songs on this cd that I would listen to and enjoy and that deserves one star. Electric guitars can be used without sounding offensive. At least some of the vocal production I heard went beyond the point of good vocal quality. If you like ""heavy metal"" sounds you will probably hate the three songs I liked."
1,Garbage,"This is not Christmas music, it's hard rock and that is not music. Give me traditional Chrismas music. Give me classical music. Give me Manheim. This cd wouldn't be a bargain if they gave it away."
5,Progressive Rock meets Christmas,"All I can say is this: the only thing better than this CD is the live show. As someone who is not Christian, and who, frankly, despises this holiday, I am impressed. Musically, vocally (especially vocally) this is one of the best Christmas albums I've ever heard. The story itself is especially poignant in these times. Listening is not enough - you have to read the liner notes. Blessed be, Happy Yuletide, and Merry Christmas."
3,"Good album--not very Christmasy, though","I actually got this album when I bought its sequel ""The Christmas Box"" and ended up playing it more! Good, rocking tunes, interesting arrangements (particularly ""First Snow"", my favorite track), but if you didn't tell anyone it was a Christmas album, they'd never guess--I play it all year long! Nice to hear the traditional tunes mixed in with some hard guitars as well. A good album for those of us who like our metal a little more melodic, but slap Nat King Cole on your CD player come Yuletide with the family. On the other hand, if it's just you and your friends getting loaded on eggnog and bemoaning the commercialism of the season, then fire away!"
2,Purchased the Wrong CD!,"This is not the CD that I wanted. I cannot rate it fairly, because of the fact that I made the mistake of ordering the incorrect CD. Some may enjoy it, but it is not my type of Christmas music."
2,Not my kind of music......,"I just didn't like the noisy chaotic sound. Even though I've heard them before on T.V., I was truly disappointed in this one, but others may enjoy it."
5,Love the closed-minded,"I love all the closed-minded people who gave this only one star!! It just shows how really closed-minded you are. I also love the review the one lady gave about how it was too religious for her Christmas tastes....hey lady, what do you think Christmas is? It is a religious Christian holiday (Notice the word Christ in the word Christmas). This CD is absolutely incredible!! And their concert...the best I have ever been to. I have been to many different types of concerts...Country, hard-rock, R&B, 80s bands, etc, and this concert is the best I have ever seen and cannot wait to see them again this year! If you ever have the chance, see them live!"
4,Great change to the traditional Chrismas album,"If you put this CD in, you are sure to get some very different reactions. The music is excellent and the singing is good. Each song is very unique in flavor. There is a very strong mix of hard rock or metal with the traditional Christmas songs and choir. I do listen to it throughout the year. The ""Carol of the Bells"" release is incredible."
4,rock guitar meets the orchestra,"Powerful, oom-pa orchestra with lots of strong 80's style electric guitar, plus some pretty acoustic guitar work. I bought it for the rendition of ""Carol of the Bells,"" and was pleased with the rest of the album. Not the very most suitable voices for some of the songs, but the instrumentals were incredible, emotional, exciting-- everything Christmas music should be. By far the better of their two Christmas albums, in the musical excellence category."
5,Trans-Siberian Orchestra,I have really enjoyed listening to the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Their music is very powerful. I even bought anextra to throw in my car when the season rolls around next year!
2,Not want I expected,"While some of the selections on this DVD follow the traditional version of the carols, others are a vast departure from the original. Not for old-school listeners."
2,Rock for Those Who Used To,"If Styx and .38 Special had gotten together to record a Christmas album in 1983, it would have sounded a lot like this. For some of you, that is a good thing. For me, not so much."
1,Horrible,"Any one who likes anytype or rock or desent guitar playing shouldn't get this CD, it's just so Cheesy, it ruins all these Christmas classics."
3,"Great music, not so enamored of the singing","Again, purchased this album with the Lost Christmas Eve album and was not expecting vocals or speech. This is also a themed album, and the music and lyrics match the theme well, just not what I expected."
4,Another Trans-Siberian triumph,"For all those who liked the ""The Christmas Attic""this is a great go-with. Altho it seems the Christmas Attic had a bit of a better storyline, this is a very nice cd to have."
5,Great music for year round.,I had been wanting this for several years and finally bought it after Christmas 2006. We could listen to this year round. My favotite is Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24. Enjoyed going online and reading how the Trans-Siberian Orchestra came about.
5,A favorite!,"Seriously, can Trans Siberian Orchestra do anything bad? Fantastic as always and well worth the cost. Ultimately, I ended up buying the boxed set after just hearing this cd."
4,As promised,"This CD was shipped very quickly and came neatly packaged. I have not yet listened to all the songs because it is a gift, but I have heard the demos and I think they are great!"
4,Trans-Siberian,"The music is very good! We've listened to it a couple of times this Christmas season, even though it arrived between Christmas and New Year's. We listened to it immediately upon delivery. A slight shaking of the package indicated there were broken pieces inside the bubble package. In fact, the entire CD case was smashed. Our fear was the CD might be damaged, but we were happy once we listened to the entire CD without incident. This CD will be part of our Christmas rotation for many years, something to energize us while we prepare for the holidays."
2,Disappointing,I'm a fan of TSO but the singing on this CD is bad. I thought I was buying an instumental CD. When I listened to the disc for the first time I felt like I waisted my money. I made myself listen to it again and realized that I was right the first time. The singing ruined it for me. The only reason I gave it a two is that they don't sing on every song.
3,not too impressive,"Robert Payne has certainly done a fair amount of research and studies in producing this book. There are not too many books about Chiang, hardly any written by Chinese authors.This book is not very stimulating. I can't see anyone avidly reading it again and again. Chinag's life was fascinating but you don't realize it by reading this book. I prefer the book 'The Man Who Lost China' by Brian Crozier"
4,Not the Usual Home-Front Tales,"The essays in ""Guerrillas, Unionists, and Violence on the Confederate Home Front"" run the gamut from the stodgy and academic to enlightening and exciting. For the most part, the various authors do a good job of uncovering dissent and pockets of Unionist sentiment throughout the South and examining the role such discontent played in the downfall of the Confederacy. They also note how home-front sentiment shifted over the course of the war.Among the stronger essays are Noel C. Fisher's look at Unionism in East Tennessee before, during and after the Civil War and Victoria E. Bynum's look at the ""Free State of Jones,"" a South Mississippi county that was a hotbed of Union sympathizers. Other essays cover dissent in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas."
2,2 Stars for Flutists; 4 for those who enjoy listening to it,I am a huge fan of Sir James Galway but was bothered by this disc. His playing is enjoyable if you can tune out everything but his flute. I didn't care for the arrangements at all.I'm more into James Galway doing traditional flute repertoire- like his cd of Mercadante Concertos- AMAZING... skip the fluff recordings where his label has been mixing past performances and including them on new releases...
5,One of the best,"""William R. Van der Zee is one of the best religious writers around today. His biblical commentary is always incisive and pragmatic, bearing a remarkable relation to life as people know it. [...] Rev. Van der Zee writes about these weighty subjects with theological exactitude, and occasionally with wit and humour."" Paul Matthew St. Pierre, in The BC Catholic, July 5, 1998"
1,Softwar expired,Do not purchase. Software expired. the cd needs to be register to install and there is no site any longer to register the software.
4,Reader Rabbit Math Adventure Ages 4-6,"It has been a great help in making learning math fun for both my 4 and 5 yr olds. They can't wait to play the games and their knowledge has improved on numbers, shapes, and colors in patterns and problem solving.I highly recommand the ""Reader Rabbit"" Line of products to everyone who has pre-k thru school age children."
5,2011 Posting - Use On Windows 7,"My 6 year old used this at 4 and is top in his kdg class for math. Wanted to use for my second son (4 yrs) and yes, it does work on Vista/Win 7.Installing Reader Rabbit:Insert CD into the computerOpen ""Computer""Right click on CD ROM drive where the program CD is locatedSelect ""explore""Open ""Install"" folderDouble click on ""SETUP32.exe""Follow on screen instructions to install programRunning Reader Rabbit:Insert CD into the computerOpen ""Computer""Right click on CD ROM drive where the program CD is locatedSelect ""explore""Open ""Install"" folderRight click on ""SETUP32.exe""Select ""Send to""Select Desktop (create shortcut)Double click on ""SETUP32.exe"" on the desktop to run the programNote: this only has to be done once. Every time you wish to run the program just double click on the ""Setup32.exe"" on the desktop. CD must be inside the computer's CD ROM drive to run program."
1,Beware -- the good reviews are for other software titles!,"I purchased Reader Rabbit Math ages 4-6 based on the excellent reviews listed here. The software was so awful that I had to come back to see why everyone thought it was so great. Then I noticed under each review ""for an alternate product."" Maybe other Reader Rabbit products are good but this one jumps from counting objects in Level One to adding three numbers on Level Two. I would think that it would make sense to stick to 2+2 before jumping to 2+3+4 which is what this program does. My five year old was immediately intimidated and confused by the software when she tried Level Two. Definitely not worth the money!"
1,Installation is a Pain,"Can't figure out why on two separate OSs the installation of this software has issues. The installation SW can't see all the file on the CDROM because they are hidden, Oh and that isn't obvious. you get an error message during install and when you go to the website their solution are incomplete and it isn't the right one for the error message. I have worked with computers for 20 years, and it took a good hour+ to figure out what was really going on....Oh and phone support for this product is disontinued."
1,have not been able to install it yet...,"well, recieved reader Rabbit Math 4-6 most recently along with a few other Stuart Little Math & Writing CDs and have had the worst time installing.Tried to install on Win98 and it failed, indicating it required a ""wing"".exe file. Same problem with a brand new WinXP operating system.Sent inquiry to Broderbund to fix the problem and received a response of instructions the size of a small novel! This is without a doubt the most difficult software program I have ever tried to install. Whenever I should get it installed (reading page 78 in ""resolving the Wing.exe issue at the moment) I will return for a review on this program..In the meantime, my little on is enjoying the other 12 children's learning programs, including Stuart Little."
1,Softsert,After purchasing it I can understand why these things are not used more often.No issues with the company product shipped like it was supposed to howeverit is way over priced and does not work very well
2,No Clear instructions,No clear instructions upon how to use it I think it's a waste of money unless you know how to use this thing!
3,Not sure if it's me or this item,"I had a really hard time with the learning curve on putting in contacts so I thought I'd give it a try. So, after a couple of weeks of trying with this thing (as I thought it may help based on some of the reviews here) I thought I'd give it a shot. Well, sadly I don't believe it helped at all and I eventually just learned to use my fingers."
2,"Not necessary, don't waste your money",I was new to using contact lenses and had a difficult time inserting them.I watched the videos on this product and was convinced it was what I needed.The truth is this product makes it even more difficult to insert your contacts.You lose feeling and don't know when it's about to press onto your eye.I feel it was a waste of my money and added zero benefit to helping me with my contacts.I continued to practice and insert them by hand.
2,lensvue magnifying and insertion aid,"This item didn't work well for me either. First of all the hardest thing for me was to be certain the lens is positioned just perfectly on the center of the top of the device and soft lenses stick to everything! Then even if I was lucky enough to finally get the lens positioned correctly on the device I couldn't see through this and had to run to get glasses which didn't help much either. I had no luck using it as an insertion tool at all but this might be an overactive ""flinch"" or fear of poking my eye too hard with the device. Finally it is quite overpriced for the flimsy cheap piece of plastic that it is. I thought it was going to be glass and a real good heavy magnifying aide but I didn't find it helpful in that respect either, mostly due to difficulty positioning the dang lens just so on the vue device. Save your money!"
2,Didn't work for me,"I really wanted to like this product, but it just didn't work for me. I could see how others might like it, but I decided against contacts after numerous attempts to get them out (getting in, no problem). This, I thought, would help, but alas, no go."
5,LensVue2 Review,"Product is great! Magnifies the lens so that you can see if there are imperfections (and not just your imagination). Grips the lens and allows for easy insertion of the lens onto the eye. Compact, easy to carry. Cool device!"
1,you cant improve on the original,"the reason i searched for this cd is because i have it in the originalvinyl L.p. and while i think the new version is just o.k. i cant helpbut think why did ms. laws re-record this when the original was perfect?the original is ""the bomb"" its smooth while her voice on this is shakie.i would love to perchase the original in form of CD. and if the originalwas re-released it would certainly sell out!."
5,Awesome! Used every single day!,"We have a little drummer who drums every single day. He went through all the fisher-price and other ""toy"" drums very quickly because they couldn't handle the daily use. These drums are fabulous! They are real, colorful, perfectly sized, beautifully sounding drums. The mallets are perfect and great to have around the house with small children. We have drum circles with any friends or visitors that come over. We've even had junior high boys come over and drum with my three year old for over an hour. LOVE these!!"
4,Little twisters,"Excellent collection of strongly observed songs about human stress, set to spare, tough music that draws on dub, funk, and noise. It's missing ""Armagh"" which is a bit surprising, and ""Pretty Boys"" which is just a pity, but otherwise a great place to start if you can't lay your hands on the first album ""Playing with a different sex"" which has been out of print for some time. Buy this before the remastered version of the second album, ""Sense and Sensuality"""
5,Exercise your brain!,"Research shows that the brain should be exercised just as the rest of the body is exercised for long-term health and function. English crosswords do more than test your trivia knowledge; they make you look into word origins, puns, anagrams, and regional language, as well. The Daily Telegraph puzzles are challenging and amusing, giving you 2 clues to each answer so you know when you have found the right word or phrase. One really gets better with practice, but they remain challenging for me after 40 years of doing them. Carry them around in your pocket for those times when you are waiting for an appointment, and see the time race by!"
5,I love my mixer,"My husband and I both do a lot of baking so a good mixer was essential. We found a jewel with our Cuisinart. We love it! We needed to replace our Kitchen Aide mixer. We researched mixers before purchasing this one. The reviews for the Cuisinart were very good from experts and people who own one. It mixes and kneads well. I love the timer feature on it and the beginning slow speed to start mixing. The shield really protects the area and attaches to the top so it lifts out of place when the head is lifted. It was easy to clean up after I was done using it. It is a nice steel gray color and looks great on my countertop. We will get years of good use from this sturdy mixer. It was packaged very securely and arrived several days after purchase. It is a bit pricey, but will last for the rest of our lifetimes. This was a Christmas gift that will be used weekly. The best kind of gift, something that will be used often.Cuisinart SM-70BC 7-Quart 12-Speed Stand Mixer, Brushed Chrome"
2,total disappointment,specifically bought this mixer with 1000 watts to use for bread making. First time I went to use it it overheated and shut down every 2 minutes..Would not buy another nor recommend anyone else waste their money. Purchased in the US but live in Canada. Hassle to return so will chalk up as abad experience.
1,"Three Words: ""MADE IN CHINA""","Given the recent problems with KitchenAid mixers, I was interested in this product until a friend purchased it and I looked closely at the label: ""MADE IN CHINA"" ... I CANNOT and will NO LONGER support ANY company who has switched manufacturing form their Country (Be it the US or Europe) to CHINA. I would rather pay more for a quality product built in the US or Europe than support Chinese Made Crap. Aren't the CEO's of these companies RICH ENOUGH ? These are NOT cheap products we are talking about. Buy QUALITY NOT Quantity. KitchenAid it is, especially since the recent gearbox problems seemed to have been resolved. In addition, Cuisinart has TERRIBLE customer service."
3,Not really brushed chrome :(,"The mixer works great and has a lot of very nice features. The only issue with it is that it is not brushed chrome as listed. The finish is nothing like my brushed chrome toaster, coffee maker, or microwave. It has a silver/grey painted finish. It is not brushed chrome."
2,a weak mixer,"Let me start with the awesome features of this mixer before I tell the terrible things. The built in digital timer that shuts off by itself was great. The ease of cleaning was great. The bowl was a great size. That's it. Now, the worst aspects. This mixer was weak as far as horsepower. It did not mix well, just okay. It left clumps of flour on the sides and bottom. I owned this for less than two months when all of a sudden it just ceased to work. There was no warning. For this amount the 7 quart bowl was great, but not worth it. I had a Kitchenaid for 10 years before it gave me problems. I had this Cuisinart for a month and a half. I will be replacing it with another KitchenAid. This mixer is great for a person who bakes small batches of stuff on occasion, but if you love to cook and bake buy something else with horsepower."
1,motor burnout,"I have owned a KA for 12 years before I decided that I needed a bigger mixer to accommodate a growing family. I read about the reviews that says Cuisinart has a more slender bowl that makes it better to mix bigger batch of bread dough. So I decided to buy the 7qt model. I owned this mixer for 4 years, and it has not been heavily used, occasional cake, and holiday cookies until 2 months ago I decided to start making bread. I made 2 loaves a week, after a 1 1/2 months, the motor burnout. I NEVER have the speed over 2 when mixing bread dough because I was afraid to burn out the motor. The recipe I use doesn't make a heavy dough either. So now I have to pull out my old KA until I decide what I want to do with this burnout motor. What a waste of $450. If you are in the market for a mixer, KA makes better quality mixers than Cuisinart."
5,Another Convert from Kitchen-Aid,"Just like so many others. My kitchen-aid broke, I bought this one and I LOVE it. Magnitudes better."
1,Great as long as there are no problems!,"Purchased this for Christmas and is stopped working within 30 days. If there is a problem, you have to pay for shipping both ways and they will ""repair it, not replace it though it was recently purchased. In addition since we did not keep the packaging, Cuisinart recommends you take the unit to a UPS or Fedex store so the shipment can be packaged effectively and they tell you it will be a minimum of $10.00 to ship their product, that malfunctioned but they have repaired back to you. Very disappointed with someone with the name recognition that Cuisinart has cultivated. Other than breaking, the mixer worked okay for a couple of weeks."
1,Customer service lacking,"Well, I called the customer service line 3 times to get some info BEFORE I purchased this mixer. Each time the estimated wait was 10 minutes or longer. Just shows me they don't put much emphasis on service. I make it a habit to call the CS number of any company, before I purchase on-line. While the product might be good, I'm not taking the chance. Moving on to another brand."
3,Iffy whisk attachment and poor customer service,"I purchased this mixer for a small business I have making chocolate confections. I used my mixer for not even three months when the whisk attachment started coming apart. I was making marshmallows and it would literally snap from the top of the attachment. I contacted Cuisinart to request a new one be sent to me as soon as possible because the machine was still under warranty. They first informed me that I had to buy a whisk attachment for $32. I was appalled. I then told them my machine was still under warranty and that a new one needs to be shipped free of charge. They then informed me that those specific attachments are out of stock and they do not know when they will be back in stock.While Cuisinart gets their stuff together, I am losing money because of their malfunctioning attachments. I am very disappointed in the quality of their whisk."
5,Love my new mixer,"I have had this mixer in previous incarnations starting with Kenwood and going on to Di Longhi. I have had this one for about a month. Now it has been completely redone with an on/off switch and timer. The splash guard finally does not fall off and you don't have to remove the beater first. The power is really great for large batches of cookies. I love the brushed chrome look. I do not have any accessories but am very impressed with the power strip on top if I want to buy them. All told, I am completely delighted with this purchase and would never go back to a pathetic kitchen Aid wannabe.I bought the mixer through Amazon and did much better in price. It arrived the day after I ordered it."
1,Enemic plastic!,"I just received this mixer and promptly put it to work. I made a bread dough recipe that I usually make with a Kitchenaid Ultra. Please note that my faithful Ultra is the 2nd smallest mixer made by Kitchenaid. The Cuisinart failed half way through the kneading process. It evidentally blew a thermal overload switch and just stopped. This is supposed to be a high end unit meant for heavy mixing but this mixer is mostly plastic and the wattage has no relivance to it's ability to knead dough. If I had to do it over, I would purchase a Kitchenaid Pro and save $150 in the bargin!"
1,Weakling,"I just received this mixer and promptly put it to work. I made a bread dough recipe that I routinely make with a Kitchenaid Ultra. Please note that my faithful Ultra is the 2nd smallest stand mixer made by Kitchenaid. The Cuisinart failed half way through the kneading process. It evidentally blew a thermal overload switch and just stopped. This is supposed to be a high end unit meant for heavy mixing but this mixer is mostly plastic and the wattage has no relivance to it's ability to knead dough. If I had to do it over, I would purchase a Kitchenaid Pro and save $150 in the bargin! There are reviews on other pages for this mixer, and they praise the mixer for the large capacity bowl. There is a world of difference between mixing cakes and kneading dough. I find praise for the timer mechanism strange. I cannot imagine a circumstance where I would leave a mixer unattended so why have a timer?"
3,Not for the serious baker,"This was my first stand mixer, and it was purchased after a lot of research. I purchased the 5 qt and the listed capacity of 12 cups of flour is nonsense. With a double loaf (6 cups) the dough flies right up into the turning mechanism. It hardly handles a double batch of oatmeal cookies - I agree with the other poster that the problem probably is the narrow shaped bowl.The timer is handy, but hey, I've got timers! It's pretty and for small jobs is fine - but so is my hand mixer that cost much less and stores easily. Actually, in my opinion, I don't think it does the crucial creaming of fat and sugar step in cookies as well as my hand mixer does.If you're looking to do a single loaf of bread on occasion and a batch of cookies now and then, this will do fine. If you want to crank out some serious goodies, though, keep looking. I don't know what my next step will be - but the search continues."
2,Mixer worked for 7 months only,"I bought a mixer in Nov. 2009 and 2 months ago the motor stopped working and smoke came out. I hate the fact that just because I live ou side of the US, I can not make use of a 2 year warranty. I left my mixer at an authorized shop and I am still waiting for them to get parts for the motor, It's been 2 MONTHS WOW!"
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this for my wife. I looks beautiful and worked well for 2 months then it just stopped working. No power at all. The return policy is difficult and extremely slow. Returning the product to Cuisinart and then returning it to me is my responsibility. Forty dollars in shipping, six weeks without the product, and rude customer service are not what I expected from product like this. All around I would not recommend. Breaking after 6 uses and to deal with customer service that I had was really disappointing."
2,Buy a KitchenAid,"I have this 7 quart model, and the hinge is loose so that the top bounces quite significantly when mixing heavy dough. Today the dough hook separated from the threaded pin that is inserted into the mixer - the threads stripped on the cheap aluminum dough hook. I called Cuisinart, as while this is an obviously defective part / design, they essentially blew me off - 2 1/2 years after purchase - so ignore the purported better warranty....I have used KitchenAid mixers extensively in my culinary training, and in spite of their own issues, they are much sturdier, overheat less, bounce less, and I've had better warranty experience with them"
5,My Cuisinart 7 qt. mixer review,I have been looking at 7 qt. mixers for a while to purchase. Then at Christmas my husband surprised me with the Cuisinart 7 qt. mixer and I love it. I do a lot of bread and have had no problem with the mixing of large batches of bread dough. It handles it very well.
3,New address.,"I have previously written 2 reviews further down on this page. Read and believe only the latter, written on April 11, 1999."
1,This book is a joke,"Power Factor Trainging is a waste of time. First they use a lot of fancy math to show what bodybuilders all ready follow, they use a rep range of 6-10 to increase size and strength. Using partial reps in bodybuilding has it's place but not every workout. Of course they take partial reps into static holds in their even worse book Static contraction training. If you are looking for quick results take roids otherwise real muscle gains take time. Champion bodybuilders usually take about 9 years of traing to reach their peak. Like wise get away from ego lifting. Strength for a bodybuilder is a means to an end not the ultimate goal. If you care so much about your one rep strength you are a powerlifter. Nutrition and cardio info from this book is seriously lacking and not helpful if you are interested in being a bodybuilder. Overall save your money and don't buy this book."
2,Flawed reasoning,"While alot of their ideas are revolutionary and extremely interesting, their essential foundation -- the indexes -- are based on faulty logic and invalid assumptions.I'm not saying that you can't gain on this program. But, because the theory is some aspects simply invalid, you may have an incorrect view as to how you made your gains and stay at plateaus.Look for Andrew Baye's article on Power Factor Training at this site for a more in-depth explanation."
2,Don't throw away your money!,"This book was an absolute waste of money. I don't understand how all these people are giving this book good ratings. I've been bodybuilding for a number of years, and I am also a certified personal trainer. I'll just ask you one question, does only making little 2 inch movements instead of a full range of motion sound normal to you? This is supose to ""strengthen"" your tendons. Give me a break."
1,Sounds good but there is no benefit from this.,"Like the review underneath me I tried this for a few months and thought I was the hulk with these huge numbers I was getting but in the end I didnt look any different and when I went back to regular weights I hadnt improved at all. When your only doing partial reps it is what is, partial. You need full range to benefit,pure and simple. This routine was garbage so please people dont even waste your time."
4,Protracted Rest Periods,"I have read with interest some of the reviews of Power Factor Training - most of them are favorable. However to those still entrenched in dogmatic bliss, I have the following:Some of the people who address the shortcomings of the training method address in PFT will find that these limitations are discussed if one is to read the book carefully. A few points are: You will avoid overtraining and stagnation if you increase your rest time between workouts as your intensity, i.e. Power Factor and/or Power Index increases. At the beginning, the authors recommend a schedule of somewhere around every 3 days to a week. But you CANNOT stick to this schedule! As the authors explain throughout, more and more rest will be needed between workouts."
5,The number 2 bodybuilding book in the world!!!,"This book is very very good almost exceptional. High intensity training is the best way to train, traditional volume training simply doesn't work except you eat all the farmacist's drugs and groth hormones.POWER FACTOR TRAINING overloads the muscle with the most important thing, huge weight.Mike Mentzer's theory isn't fully correct because he backs up full range of motion.I have seen in myself that range of motion doesn't mean anything,my muscles have grown like never before, and i am defenitly much stronger.The musclefibers contract and respond only on huge stress,high weights.This book lags behind only to Peter Sisco's and John Little's new book STATIC CONTRACTION TRAINING.For me these 2 bodybuilding experts have changed the way of training for ever."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Narrowly-focused weight-training book. Recommends partial reps while disregarding every other weight-training technique. Mathematical formula used to measure workload requires a lot more record-keeping than most lifters care for. Narrow, not revolutionary and certainly, not scientific."
3,Maybe this is for you,"I am not going to get overly technical in this review. If you are in the beginner or intermediate stages of weightlifting, then I would not recommend this book. Go buy Beyond Brawn. If you are really thinking of buying this book though, consider the following points. Point one is that you really need a power rack. If you dont have one then this workout is dangerous. Poiint two is that you really should have a strong partner. This is not a necessity, but it will make things a lot easier. Point three is that the authors recommend doing your reps quickly, and say that the ability to do reps at a fster rate means you've gotten stronger. I dont know about all that but I do know that the faster you do your reps the more likely you are to get hurt, so be careful. Overall I would say that this is not for beginners, if you are already strong and are lokking for something different then you may want to try this book. It is interesting, but keep the above points in mind."
5,Get it if you can,"Quetin Crisp at his glorious best. The first CD is all dry witt monologue. Mannered and very amusing. Some side splitting moments of humour. And he's just so gosh darn likeable- bitchy but with such niceness about it that its fun and wit.The second CD is the best of the two, where Quentin answers questions put in by the audience at half time.If you at all liked his writing, this performance just adds that extra dimension of hearing the right voice reading out the words.I imagine, Quentin Crisp sitting in an arm chair, in a glorious velvet suit, waving his arms and rolling his eyes during the whole story telling.So I am a Quentin 'Fan boy' of sorts. But this was a find in the back of a dusty bin in a record shop, and is one of my favorite CD's."
1,CHEEP IMPORTED CRAP AVOID !!,It is cheep and imported crap it has a hum buzzzz all the time it runs with the car on avoid this junk and spend some money on a real unit .
3,pyramid car stereo,"I got this pyramid car stereo three weeks ago, above all is working fine but the only problem it has is that the tuner changes from its set position to another and sometimes if you insert CD into its compactment, it will not enter properly and if you try to eject it, it comes out half way. Besides all these, the unit works fine."
1,Surprised Amazon.com sells this,"Pyramid CDR49DX AM/FM/MPX CD Player/Receiver with Detachable Face. I gave this a rating of 1 since it is least that can be given or I would have given a ZERO. I have this POS simply because it came in my Travel Trailer, man what a let down, the camper is awesome then hey lets listen to some music, OK there I got the station now to sit down, just get sat down and you have to get up and reset station because it moves on it's own---developers hay if you are going to sell such a POS at least send a remote a long with then you won't get bashed quite as bad.PLEASE RUN AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THIS UNIT AND IF POSSIBLE FROM THE ENTIRE COMPANY LINE, THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THEM STEP UP AND MAKE A DECENT UNIT. M2CW."
4,At last,"We had organ and chime music every year at home, and as an adult I've missed it. Finally, I've found a close approximation."
5,SensuousTrumpet Playing,"Purchased this album because of the great Album cover, was I surprised when I popped it into my CD player. I hadn't heard of Rick Braun before but after listening to this CD, I ran out and purchased everything he has ever recorded. Never have I heard a trumpet sound so beautiful. Share this music with someone you love."
5,Classic Braun Smooth Jazz,"Rick Braun's ""Body and Soul"" is one of the best smooth jazz albums ever recorded. Smoky, sensual, and restrained, Braun's muted trumpet is the centerpiece of an eclectic mix of sounds ranging from funky to romantic. His technical expertise is amazing, and Braun is light years ahead of Chris Botti. If you love the trumpet, and you're a lover of smooth jazz, buy this CD. It's an essential purchase from a musician who is vastly underrated. Five stars and highly recommended!"
5,Body & Soul --- MIND & SPIRIT,"I highly recommend this CD. Such exquisite trumpet playing is sure to touch your soul, soothe your body, and put you in touch with your mind and spirit. Consider yourself blessed to be touched by someone with this much talent."
4,Body & Soul,"Again another great album by Rick Braun. So easy to listen to. Particularly like, missing in venice and hymn for her."
3,Snooze Jazz,"I was hoping for something in the jazz vein, with something a bit more up tempo. This CD is very quiet very slow and is perfect if you are up late and can't sleep."
2,Not for medical students...,"I bought this book recently and opened it, full of enthusiasm, ready to read. However I found that it's more a pathology than pathophysiology book. It tries to mix the two subjects and as a result it does not cover sufficiently either of the two. It is nicely organized though and may be good for other health sciences, but NOT for medical students!Many of its pictures are ""borrowed"" from Robbin's Basic Pathology 7th ed. by Kumar, Cotran et al."
4,material fairly user friendly,"Breaks down diseases into Pathophysiology, etiology and clinical manifestations and for some diseases the diagnosis and treatment as well.I have had the book for about 2 months and so far i have found it to be very helpful. The context is understandable and provides tables and diagragms for clarification."
4,perfect for all aspiring tenors,"If you love opera, and on top of that, Domingo, then this album is a must-have. Every selection is dazzeling, from an explosive ""Una furtiva lagrima"" to a melodic ""Il mio tesoro"" you can't go wrong. And if you are a tenor looking for a sound to emmulate and music to study, look no further."
3,Expensive,"I have been buying from Amazon since they tend to offer the lowest prices, and have come to trust them. However, for this item the price is too high. I checked at the corelle site (stupidly AFTER buying from amazon) and the price there is less than half the price I paid here. I am disappointed. The plate looks great."
5,One of Gerrold's best!,"An excellent tale! The reader is swept along by a compelling story, interesting characters, and Gerrold's wonderful writing style. Through the tale's twists and turns, the reader is eager to find out what happens next. Read it. You won't be disappointed!"
1,Dangerous!,"Our cart was delivered in a timely fashion by UPS in an unopened, factory sealed box containing the components of the log cart, each which was covered with a pungent toxic residue that induced headaches and nausea in three individuals. Only after the parts and packaging were removed from the house and the floor mopped did the odor dissipate. Our NEW NorthernTool Log cart is now in the trash."
3,Read comment below,My wife read this book and we do not have a abusive relationship if you were in an abusive relationship this would be a very good book
5,Need help in your marriage?,If your relationship is in trouble . . . Start here! This is a good book to help you compartmentalize your relationship. What is the foundation ? What is the problem? How can we improve it? A good read . . .
5,FANTASTIC!,"This book is over the top! It is sooo practical and do-able. EVERYONE needs to read this book. After I read mine, I ordered ten more to give to friends and family--no special occasions,just because it is so great. I've never done that with any other book before. Great for parents, couples, singles, engaged couples, grandparents, and older children!! GREAT!"
5,Biblical counsling,"The DNA of Relationships is one of the best books i have ever read.It is a strong book on relationships. When you understand that you are made for relationships then, you will work on your relationships. I strongly recommend this book!!!"
4,Practical and Useful Tips for Healthy Relationships,"This book is an easy read and gives practical advice on how to stop unhealthy behaviors that impact relationships. Requires individuals to first take responsibility for their own fears that lead to destructive results. If you have not read lots of relationship books, this would be a good primer. The survey you can complete to identify your greatest fears will uncover some ""aha""s"" for why your conflicts sometimes are difficult to resolve."
3,Don't play the blame game!,"I got this book to help me with relating to my mother in law as well as other significant people in my life. I heard Gary Smalley on Dobson and I have gone to a seminar 15 years ago to hear him. I liked the idea of taking charge of your own self and not blaming the other person for negative relationships. That is something we all do and it does not help get on with one's interaction and bad relationships. I have learned alot from this book and highly recommend it as a tool for helping you get out of the ""blame game"" and look at yourself to get on with your relationships in life."
5,A Deserted Island Book,"This book is one of my very few deserted island books. (Had I only space for ten, this would be one of them.) It has changed the way I relate to others in many ways. I know that my marriage and other important relationships in my life are already improving based on Smalley's principles. It is, as he suggests, a ""Marriage Intensive"" in book form. I'm learning, with practice, to create safe relationships, take good care of myself to bless others, and take personal responsibility for my relationships. It's amazing what this book has done for my perspective, and that, my friends, is worth 5 stars. It is well written and well organized, sprinkled with personal experiences that are particularly applicable. I intend to give this book to others, which is rare for me, since I feel reading material is a very personal choice. I hope I've conveyed how strongly I recommend this groundbreaking work! Thank you for your time."
3,Mediocore,"I was not too thrilled with this book. I have other books from this author that I find to be far more helpful than this one. Yes, it did have some very valid points & I don't want to take away from that. I wasn't happy with the flow or the structure of this book."
5,Very helpful!,"This book is the best thing to happen to my relationships with my wife, kids, co-workers, friends and parents. The lessons taught will help with any relationship!"
3,Fair,I am giving this book a fair review because it is a bit repetitive. It is an easy read and I love that it uses Godly principals.
1,very disappointed!,"Was so excited because I thought I found a fun math games program for my kids, but I can't install it on our computer and am now sending it back. I guess it only works on really old computer systems... so frustrating as this was a Christmas present! They were so disappointed as well... I'm sure if it worked on our computer it would be awesome as we have other reader rabbit games that do work and my kids love them."
1,Stay away unless you have a very old Operating Sytem,"This software does not work on my Mac (OS X 10.5) or my PC (Windows XP). Very, very disappointed. Not as advertised!"
1,Beware OLD Reviews,"This may have been a great product at one time. However, take careful note that some of the best reviews are from 7 or 8 years ago. When I attempted to install this on my Windows Vista, I got an error message that it was incompatible and no other options to install it."
1,Not What You Think!,"I purchased this product in July 2009 for my daughters. I have a Mac OS-X. This version of Reader Rabbit is supposed to work with MacIntosh System 7.1 and higher, but it DOES NOT. I tried online help to no avail. I agree with the writer of Beware Old Reviews. This product is not compatible with newer computers! Buy at your own RISK!!"
3,Cute,This is a cute game for kids. It takes them on an adventure while learning some basic math skills. My daughter likes it and I have bought one for my 6 year old nephew too.
4,Your child will learn math!,This is a great math game. The colors are bold and music is entertaining. It can be a little fustrating swimming through the stream to get the right answers for younger ones.
1,Math Ages 6-9,The graphic are very mediocre and the product was basically designed for non Windows platform and doesn't work very well. Waste of money and time
1,does not work on VIsta or Win 7,"OK so it just dies on Vista and even with Win 7 (great OS btw)Lucky I have a top notch machine still running XP so was able to try it out.....First off it was poorly planned, the problems are far far far to easy and bored my 7 year old within 4 seconds, which happens to be about how long it takes to see anything happen.THere are much better free sites to use then this very dated old hack..Normally I dont slate a product but this is real junk wrapped up in a dvd."
2,Not that fun for 6 years old.,"I bought the game for my sister. I was watching her play and the game itself seems dull compare to jumpstart series, and the pace was waay to fast for a six year old to follow. It's good to introduce the child to new types of math so they can acquaint with it sooner, but this was just straight out hard for a six year old. The fraction part was introduced too early in the level of the game and the game itself didn't show her how to do it the problem even once nor provided any visual cues. How is a child suppose to play and learn when all they do is get frustrated?"
5,Great Game,Was very happy with this game. My son just loved the fun characters and would play it for hours if I let him. And he's already moved up several levels. I like how the levels automatically get harder or easier depending on how they do. Great way to reinforce what they're already learning in school.
5,Math Adventures is Great!,"I bought RR Math Adventures three years ago, and my son who is now almost 8 has used it off and on ever since. When he was younger I sat with him and explained some of the easier concepts, and little by little, he has finished the disk. I'm especially impressed by his understanding of fractions - which they haven't had in school yet, and currency - since we don't even live in the U.S. and he's never even seen U.S. money. Not to mention that English is a second language for him. I think that speaks very well of the teaching methods of this program. I've also run it on Win98 and XP with no problems. We've enjoyed this disk very much."
3,My kids liked it,My daughter liked this. She enjoyed playing the games and it seemed to help her math skills even when she didn't know it was.
1,Does not work on newer computers,"When the title says ""Old Version"" it means it will not work on newer computers. More specifically, it will not run on a 64-bit operating system. Normally, old 32-bit software runs fine on a 64-bit Windows or Mac, but I could not find any compatibility tweaks that would allow this to run. If you have the means to build a virtual machine, that would probably work."
1,"New, but not improved","This program won't fully load on my computer. Problems with Windows 7? Unlike the original programs, this one needs to be connected to the Internet to run. Duh! It's for kids. If I have to look over their shoulder all the time, it defeats my purpose. I'm returning it."
1,eye tuck anti-bag technology,I felt that it made no change in my appearance at all and canceled any further purchases.
2,Nothing happend so far,"My wife is using this product more than one month but nothing happend so far.I think,i wasted my money."
5,It works for me!!!!!!,This product is a blast! I got terrible-looking eye bags at the age of 29 and they made me look like a 50-year-old woman. So old and tired-looking. After using this product for a week (I bought it somewhere else) my face started to looked dramatically different! So much younger! I will keep on using it for 60 days - that's what they advise. I'm excited already. It think you should try it!
4,Recommended,"Have been using this product for two years. Haven't found one that takes all the puffiness out, but this one does a good job and is the best I've tried so far (I've tried a lot.). Moisturizes the eye area without leaving an oily residue."
2,Not about real blondes,"This book is not about blondes; it is about brunettes who bleach their hair. Real blondes - those who got their hair colour from their genes and not out of a bottle - will be disappointed, as there's nothing in this book that relates to them. There is a lot of interesting information about the bottle blondes like Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe and Madonna but real blondes are quite something different."
1,cheap...cheap...cheap,"i recived that belt was very disapointed...poor disign,leather pealing off the loops, cheap matirials been used for it...plus its uncomfortable and so stiff...other words cheap crap"
5,Angelina Ballerina: The Big Performance,Gave this to my granddaughters for Christmas and they enjoy it while playing with their Angelina Ballerina Dolls. Thanks!
1,poor biker movie,save your money movie was poorly done not as good as above the law or stone cold not on the level of easy rider
3,A mixed bag,"First of all, the cover on this dvd has nothing to do with the story, so beware of that. However, bikers still may find something to enjoy, because that tends to be the focus of the plot. I found it an enjoyable 90 minutes, but it could have been a lot better. Best part is subplot of two hit men chasing Casper Van Dien across the southwest, including their encounters with truckers and a Native American jewelry salesman. Both are clever moments.The main plot, involving a corrupt government official out to cover his tracks, starts well but falls flat by the end of the movie. I did enjoy the scenery."
4,"Saw the premier, I liked it","I went to the showing and met the writer. I actually liked the movie and so did my fellow bikers. I found some humor in the movie and a good balance of action and a decent plot.It is a fun movie in a complex and crappy world in which we live. I know the writer and his associates put ten hard years in making the movie a reality. It is more than a movie, it is an accomplishment of one man's dream to put a story into a film and make it a reality."
4,Chilled Man,This album is a very good mix of Indie and Alt Dance. Would recomend for those people who like to relax on a sunday morning listening to quality music
4,Useful supplement to Harvard Negotiation Program's new book...,"This book offers articles on negotiation and conflict resolution, but has no overarching theory to it. The individual chapters are all well-written, however. I especially liked ""5 ways to keep disputes out of court"" and ""the team that wasn't."" These kinds of chapters make the book poignant and show how groups operate under conditions of conflict and high-intensity emotion.THis book is a useful supplement to the groundbreaking new negotiation bestseller ""Beyond Reason: USing Emotions as You NEgotiate"" (written by Roger Fisher, who is probably the most influential thinker in the field of negotiation and conflict resolution)."
5,It's embarrassing how much I like the pot,"... because it's a pot for god's sake. Anyway, it is as billed. A heavy cast iron enamelled dutch oven that you can stick in the oven. Too obvious? For a non-cook like me, the whole braising concept was only an emerging idea. But it works. Things turn out so good, and it has nothing to do with my skill level. Every meal should basically start with tossing bacon, a bottle of wine, and some meat into a big pot and coming back four hours later. You can't go wrong. And... I'm going there. It's pretty. It's red and shiny and I like it the way I liked matchbox cars when I was a kid. I don't even put it in the cabinet. It sits on top of a shelf in full view. So go ahead, spend too much money on a pot. You'll justify it with occasionally cooking pasta sauce in it, and say, ""See! It was worth it! We use it all the time!"" It's not just for braising!"
3,haven't tried it yet,"I researched the product on Staub's website before purchase and thought that I wouldn't have to season it. Once the product arrived and I read the instructions, I was mis-informed. Seasoning is required before use. I've not had the opportunity to season it and therefore haven't used the product yet."
3,Takes longer than 1 flight,"This CD is just for Basic dutch, but that's quite alot to learn even on long flight. Maybe I'm retarded, but after about a week of listening in my car daily, I retained about 80% of the phrases and words.Ironically, people in the Nederlands speak English as a second language. So Listen to chapter 2, ""Sprecken ya Anals?"" (you speak English?) is all you need. I did pretty well talking dutch and it did impress my fellow travelers. I did introduce my buddy as my girlfriend a bit too many times, funny though."
3,A Good Primer for Beginers,"The book begins with a history of cable exercising. The 2nd half offers a wide selection of exercises for almost every muscle group. You probably will try these exercises and then pick several to use consistently. The book is not a must-have, but if you're just starting out with cable exercising, you'll find useful and easy-to-understand examples and information."
4,Must have for Wes Anderson fans.,My favorite thing about this screenplay is being able to read scenes that did not end up in the movie or the deleted scenes. I would recommend this for any Royal Tenebaums or Wes Anderson fan.
2,Not the same as the photo,"I purchased this bag because of the photo, which has big white plain adidas name on the side. What i got is the same logo from the sides, not the adidas name in big, as the photo shows.It might sound like a minor detail, but i chose this bag because of that, and i'm kinda dissapointed.I have to travel in tne next few days so i can't return it."
5,Funny as hell,"Before listening to Back in Town, I listened to his latest CD, You Are All Diseased. I then listened to this CD and laughed twice as much as I did listening to You Are All Diseased. This is a great comedy album and reccomend it to anyone who likes Jerry Seinfeld or Joe Pesci, the person George Carlin prays to."
2,Disappointing,"George Carlin is one of the most clever comedians of out time, but he really starts to lose it in the 90's and Back in Town is a good example of how he's replaced clever insightfulness with bad language. With the exception of the track ""Abortion"", the album lacks wit displayed in his other classic routines like Class Clown."
1,this sucks,"Carlin used to be funnier. He has no delivery. He has quit being a comedian and just makes observations. However, the crowd in the backround seemed to enjoy it."
3,Not his best,"George Carlin is much more than a comedian. He is also a poet, and not the least, a philosopher. Back in town really not Carlin's funniest work, but it is worth checking out."
5,An excellent way to start listening to GC,"I bought this cd during a business trip in the US, with the suggestion of a colleague of mine who found Carling incredibly funny. And incredibly funny he is, to say the least !Knowing how things happen ""the American way"" might be of help, and listening to him talking requires a certain knowledge of daily American English, but again for non-US residents that's also where the fun lies.As it happens with such situations, I found myself laughing and going back to listen again to what I missed because of the laugh...Definitely a necessary voice to make us laugh and think about the contradiction of this life. Even those who don't agree with him on things like abortion or death penalty will find parts as ""Family expression"" funny and right on the point.Cds like this are the blue chips of comedy !"
3,"The second-best of ""Air Marshall Carlin""","Call it the ""Air Marshall Carlin"" period. Far from the days of the hippy-dippy weatherman, this is George Carlin the statesman of digusted cynicism. By taking the foibles of American culture and exaggerating them, Carlin has hit on a winning brand of topical humor: witty, on-target, and ruthless... In the liner notes, Carlin claims this is his best album... But for my money, his previous JAMMIN' IN NEW YORK features the best balance of harsh social commentary and timeless humor. On this offering, ""free-floating hostility"" upsets the balance and makes for an album angrier than it is funny. But it's still pretty funny."
3,Solid Running Shoe,"This is a solid running shoe for big runners. It can take pounding with no problem, and I will say it will last you for a long time. My complain is that this shoe is on the 'motion control' side, so it feel a little too rigid for me. But it's possible that I haven't broken in the shoe yet. I can't comment on the normal width of the shoe because I ordered W width, and it turned out not very comfortable to me. The length of the shoe feels all right."
1,WARNING!,These songs do not go with the CD pictured. This CD is actually techno-beat and rave crud. Do not purchase!!!
1,These are junk. Mis-leading software.,I bought one of these to use in trucking and after you buy it you must buy more to add on for it to work.Junk.
4,Not missing out on Dessert,"The desserts in this book are sinfully decadent. My only concern is that a lot of sugar and oil are used in many of the recipes and therefore they are not low in fat (and are high in calories).BUT desserts aren't supposed to be low fat etc. so go ahead, if you are missing having GREAT desserts due to a milk allergy, then this is the book for you!Be sure to try the carrot cake, it is the best I've EVER HAD!"
2,Wayyyyyy too simple,"I do NOT recommend this book to anyone, regardless of your skill level. What I was hoping for was a legit pocket guide to aide in my inspections. I am just an everyday homeowner, and have basic understanding of mechanical and electrical systems. This book may serve somebody as an introduction to home inspections if you have absolutely no idea what goes into a house. If you are in this category, it may help you understand what a home inspector is doing. It does not help at all in completing your own preliminary inspection. To be clear, I was NOT expecting this book to teach me how to inspect a home; I was expecting it to provide a convenient reference during an inspection. I would recommend The Home Inspection Book: A Guide for Professionals by Marcia Darvin Spada, but it may be too detailed. At least it has a checklist. However, don't buy the Pocket Idiot's Guide - the first crappy Idiot's Guide I've ever bought."
2,The Pocket Idiot's Guide to home inspections,"If you have never bought a home before and never considered the aspects of a home inspection this book would be OK. I am going on home number 10 so this book was too basic. Frankly, I bought it because it was cheap and I got what I paid for. That aside, for first timers this is not a bad introduction. It does cover all the bases. My one suggestion is don't be passive in the inspection process. Take part from start to finish in the actual inspection. Ask questions. The roof is always a key area and some inspector won't go there; they should. Water and power issues are big money if problems arise so make sure they are thoroughly inspected."
5,Great Book for Home Buyers,"This book was recommended by a real estate agent. If you are looking at buying a home, this book helps you to weed out trouble. Although it doesn't take the place of a home inspector, when you finally decide on a home, it helps you make informed decisions based on a homes condition.I am reminded of friends buying a home, then replacing the carpet and finding out that they needed to replace the subfloor. They didn't have this book or use a building inspector before buying that home."
5,Very pleased,I was very pleased with the book which was in excellent condition as stated by the seller and it was a very good price. I have been wanting this book for years. Ordered one in 2005 which went missing in the post. I live in London and someone sent it to me. The same book in the UK is a LOT more expensive and much harder to come by.
4,Small Potatoes by Michael Witt,"...Mr. Witt does a good job of placing the reader in the front row roller-coaster seat as SMALL POTATOES gives you one thrill after the other. The plot is fast-paced, and a great cast of colorful characters as you view the story from the criminals' point of view and Ramey's, all which keeps the reader, glued to the book. Witt also gives you a wonderful flavor of Ocean City, eating hard crabs, shopping and fun on the beach. People that know it will love revisiting some of the treasured spots. Once you start the book you can't put it down. SMALL POTATOES would make an exciting movie!"
5,Surprise! Works better than expected.,"I've used this gizmo now 4 times - 3 chickens and one small turkey breast - on my gas grill. When I first got it, I didn't think the so-called ""non-stick"" coating was going to work very well, but I was surprised to see that I could scrub off the baked-on crud with an ordinary dish scrubber and some soap and water pretty easily. I'd say it takes about twice as much effort as, say, a Silverstone pot used for spaghetti sauce.Stores pretty neatly too - just lay the smokestack on its side and it fits on the shelf in less space than a fry pan.As for how it works, I've never used any other kind of vertical roasting device so I have no idea if there are better ones out there. But this one seems to work just fine! The cup capacity is only about 6 ounces, but there is always leftover beer or orange juice (my favorite) still in there after the bird is done cooking so I figger the cup size is big enough."
5,A Beautiful Voice in Fiction,"I first read the work of Sonya Taaffe in the pages of Caitlin R. Kiernan's Sirenia Digest. It was a reprint of ""Constellations, Conjunctions"" and after reading it, I immediately ordered Singing Innocence and Experience. This book is gorgeously written in a very lyrical style. Many of the stories read as a sort of prose poetry, while the poems included are equally affective. I strongly recommend this book to all. And for more and previously unpublished works by Sonya Taaffe, check out Sirenia Digest here: www.caitlinrkiernan.com/sirenia.html."
3,good Polish film,"I don't know what movie the editoral review is referring to but it isn't this. This was an early movie directed by Wojciech Has (The Saragossa Manuscript). A man (Tadeusz Janczar) takes a girl home from a bar. The one night they spent together changes the course of their lives. The man prospects alters with the war. When he comes back he comes back penniless finding the girl married into wealth to spite him. She isn't any happier than before. Even though this makes a statement about the social classes, it has enough soap opera to make it more than just a statement movie. Janczar delivers a great Bogart like performance."
2,disappointed,"I bought this CD because of another Amazon review, saying this CD would appeal to NIN and Metallica fans alike. Give me a break, NIN is a hell of a lot better than these guys. There songs are not really that great, and there certainly isn't enough heavy music to even compare them to Metallica. If you want real music, do pick up NIN:The Downward Spiral, Type O Negative, or old Metallica. get the real thing."
4,Tastes Really Good,"This soup is very good. It's easy to fix--just add water--and olive oil if you want. It's done cooking in 30 minutes. What could be easier. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the soup seemed a little thin compared to the home made bean soups I make. The flavor is really good, however. I might add a can of red beans to the mixture next time to give it more body."
2,A Hassle,"You can't add or remove filters when this is in place, which is expected, but it's really hard to put it on and take it off. If I'm in direct sunlight, a just use a cheap reflective umbrella (black on the outside) to shade the camera (and myself) during long exposures."
3,"Two Good Tracks, Two Not So Good","Usually, you expect that when an artist releases remixes of their own stuff, it should be better than when other people remix it. But here, both the 28 mix and D-Scape mix (which also doesn't resemble the track D-Scape on part 1 of this single) are drawn-out tracks that don't really go anywhere, and might not even be remixes of On (not that this would be new for Aphex). But the remixes by others are good. The Reload mix by Tom Middleton is a nice laid-back version that appeared on the US version. The u-ziq remix (which was actually the first remix he ever released) is similarly laid-back, but has a building up feel to it that works quite well, and is almost as good as the original. Definitely get this for the remixes, but if you feel the need to download them, the u-ziq mix is actually over 8 minutes long, as opposed to the 6:44 version that pops up on the internet all the time."
5,Favorite Antihistamine from an Unlikely Source,"It may be unusual, but I have had asthma and hay-fever allergies since I was 18 months old and the best medicine to alleviate the symptoms has been Clemastine, which is the generic name for Tavist.. I had previously bought it at major drug stores but they have all stopped carrying it. When my local small town druggist told me he couldn't get any form of the medicine because ir was no longer on the lists, I turned to the internet. Up popped Dayhist Allergy by GoodSense and I was excited. Then I realized it was being sold for pets and I became dubious. After ordering and receiving the product I found it was identical to the product my druggist had been getting for me.The price is good and the delivery is fast. Great product. Good source."
1,Not a good learning tool,"I put this away after 10 minutes and won't use it again. The English narration is too distracting and the Turkish phrases are spoken in a way that it's hard to retain them or develop your own pronunciation. The words and phrases presented are random and do not build on each other.Audio courses in a language lab have a 'repeat' button so you can jump back repeatedly until your pronunciation matches the audio. A language cd like this one, which of course doesn't have this feature, should compensate with more repetition. And the repetition should not be intermixed with English so that the phrase you are learning remains in your mental ear. As it is, I did not find myself retaining anything from this audio course.If there is a better cd audio course for Turkish out there, please let me know."
3,not bad-not great,"I like that I can read the words along with the CD, however there is more english speaking than Turkish. This is a short CD and I doubt that most people could learn more than Hello and a question or two while ""in-flight"". I should have spent my money on a more in-depth CD. One definatly needs to try to learn before departing and use more than this book/CD set."
4,Talking Turkey,Well organized and easy to follow.The book is thin and can easily fit in a back pocket.It would have been better if the Turkish was presented twice.
4,Fascinating,"Even those, such as myself, who are not remotely interested in theater or the British social scene in the 70s should read this book. Tynan's diaries at times read like a novel...tart, clever, bitchy, and occasionally venomous. Tynan seems to have known everybody and has something interesting to say about all of them. But his most interesting character is himself; he pulls no punches and really excavates his soul. That is the true joy of reading this book. At times it's painful to read, at other times it's hysterical. But it is never boring."
1,worst artist and dvd on the planet,"I really dont get why so many people like this trash , all his songs are horrible , he's just a one hit wonder an everyone will forget this bastard soon hopefully"
1,Poor sound quality on both ends...,I bought this device and waited 2 weeks to get it. I was extremely disappointed with the quality and am returning it back to Amazon. The person on the other line could not here me clearly. I had a cheaper one from Samsung that was much better.
4,Good quality.,"Common sense (and in some enlightened places, the law) demand headsets while using the cellphone in the car. Many are flimsy and fit poorly, with questionable quality. Not so the Body Glove. With a moldable, over-the-ear piece, it is pretty comfortable. It also has 3 interchangeable boom covers (a frill) to match your decor/outfit. Sound is 5 x 5. The small in-line pod allows for answer, volume and mute functions with 1 finger. All in all, it is a winner."
2,Good premise does not quite deliver,"The best part is the answer/end pod which works swell with my Samsung sch-a670 phone. But the ear piece is nearly overwhelmed by ambient noise, and the mic makes you sound ""distant"", making it difficult to hear or be heard. The ear hook is almost impossible to put on one-handed, but fit the shape of my ear quite comfortably, so I ended up using it more at the office rather than on the road. Overall it could be better, not recommended for driving because of interference from external noise and difficulty in putting on. Voice commands did not work with this product, but to be fair they worked sporadically without."
1,Best part was destroying it with a hammer!!,"This headset is the worst I have ever owned. The over ear arm will not hold its position. The earpiece fits over the outer ear,does not stay in place, constantly slipping out of position, making a normal conversation impossible."
1,BEWARE - Limited number of uses!,"I purchased this item in July and it stopped working for me the last week of September. So, it lasted only 3 months and for maybe 12 uses in that time frame. Even when it worked I had a hard time hearing anyone because the unit was so quiet and muffled. People on the other end said they could hear me fine, but it doesn't do much good if I can't hear them.Now that it is past 30 days, I can't return this item to Amazon for a full refund. And even if I could, would it be worth spending $8 in shipping to get a refund on a $15 item? There is a reason this item is reduced from $30 to $15. Buyer beware!"
2,Comfortable but too quiet,"I too had to wait a longer to recieve this item. I figured, what the heck, it's not too expensive. It's stylish and comfortable, but in the end, to darn quiet. I double checked to make sure my phone was cranked up, but this headset is just not loud enough. I couldn't see using this while driving in traffic, you wouldn't hear the other person. The packaging says it's compatible with many brands of phones including Motorala, but the end/answer button didn't work in my Motorola 120x. I'll be returning this to Amazon."
1,The last of the Swashbucklers - Stewart Granger,"It is all too obvious that Don Shiach's book `The last of the Swashbucklers' on the life of Stewart Granger is nothing but a critical attack, He probably tried to accomplished his endeavor to write this critical attack on the autobiography, `Sparks Fly Upward', written by Stewart Granager which he quotes often. It is not a `vivid portrait'. It must stem from Shach's background that continues to haut him in making an effort to be condescending in order to blow his own horn on the lives of others in order to seek some acclaim to bolster his own ego as an author. The only true quality of the book is the insert of pictures leaving the written description set aside. What people don't do in order to make a buck!"
5,just like in the old days,it smells like cloves but taste like wintergreen and it was purchased to help me quit smoking although im still smoking the gum is ued every day for me to enjoy. i guess im going to find something else for my smoking problem.
4,Great Xmas Gift,"Family loved getting several packs of these in their stockings! Created lots conversation with adults and enjoyed by young folk, too."
4,Mild wintergreen taste,"Reminds me of teaberry ice cream, a little like Pepto Bismol (without the chalkiness). It's a mild wintergreen flavor, but loses the flavor pretty quickly. I used to LOVE this gum when I was little. It probably hasn't changed much since 1900, so it's a little boring. Not sure if I will ever be able to finish 180 pieces. 4 stars because it's nice to know you can still get it for posterity's sake. . ."
4,Old Time Favorite,"Love the flavor. It doesn't last a long time like Black Jack, but it still very enjoyable."
1,Another ripoff from Masterplan,"Seems that Masterplan makes their money by trying to make money off bootlegs by packaging them nicely. Aerosmith will never see a time of this.That said, the audio and video is crappy. And so is the packaging."
1,BOOTLEG ON A SILVER DISC !!!!!,THIS IS A BOOTLEG. I OWN ABOUT 100 BOOTS AND SOME COMPANIES GET CREATIVE WITH THE SILVER DISC'S. DON'T BE FOOLED. THIS IS NOT AN OFFICAL RELEASE. THE QUALITY IS MARGINAL AT BEST......
1,This DVD Does Not Compare To Aerosmith Big Ones,The reviewer on here is correct the dvd was not correctly made. Aerosmith Big Ones To Look At.I give It a +10.******************************
4,Get some Ocean Colour Scene into your life!,Ocean Colour Scene are very successful back in England. Their Paul Weller type sound has made them household names. With the release of 'One From the Modern' OCS show their true class and ability to write great tracks. From the political 'Profit in Peace' to the emotional lyrics of 'July'. This album is a must for anyone who liked 'Moseley Shoals' as this album is just as good. I highly recommend that you invest some dollars in this album because you wont regret it.
2,Not so impressed!,Not as nice as I thought; Exhaltation of Larks is a much better book; lots more words and word history included.
3,Another scumbag turned snitch ..and tiring movie.,"This gentleman did this to his own people,and with the excuse of money, then he turned snitch, this movie is just trying to capitalize on all the recent so-called gangster genre movies. I wish they would stop."
4,An Authentic Look...,"This is a good DVD that chronicles the life and rise in the drug game of Nicky Barnes, who appeared on The New York Times magazine cover at the height of his heroin empire with the title MR. UNTOUCHABLE. Not a smooth move on his part as a criminal investigation prompted by the magazine cover, which was seen by President Jimmy Carter, ensued. But Nicky Barnes was an intriguing and mesmerizing figure as his portrayal by Cuba Gooding Jr. in the American Gangster film showed. There is rumored to be an offshoot movie starting Cuba Gooding Jr as Nicky Barnes in the works. There is also a book out by the same title and Nicky Barnes was interviewed and his story profiled in F.E.D.S. magazine also. But check out the DVD it is nice and tells his story and was directed by the famous director producer Marc Levine. The DVD captures the story perfectly and also is a good look at the era when New York city was a virtual crime zone and open air drug market for Nicky's heroin brand"
3,lily pons,"Pons died in 1976. I wasnt aware of her death during that time. In the 1980's I became really interested in collecting as many of her recordings that were available. I think she was the greatest coloratura soprano who ever lived and if you read Sills & Peters comments about her they too agreed. I found this recording which was probably issued about the time of her 100th birthday. Only the ""Shadow song"" sounds like the Pons I loved. The other recordings are old,and tinny sounding some of them are recorded back nearly 80 years ago."
2,Not quite as expected,I guess I rate this as 2 stars only. I expected the movie with Grace Kelly more -- this is quite stupid - waste of talent by GK and AG.... and waste of my time watching it.
5,Wonderful!,"This is one of my favorite movies. Charming, funny, elegant, whitty. If you love Grace Kelly or Sir Alec Guinness, you have got to see it."
1,IO error reading the movie.,"This does not look like a completely professionally produced DVD. The DVD looks like it is made on a rewritable DVD (puple on the DVD side not silver). It got an IO erro about 2/3s of the way through (maybe where the layer break occurs).Since it's sold by Amazon LLC I don't think it's a pirated movie, but it looks like one."
3,Not as great,"When ordering the book, I anticipated something different, a book that describes a situation and how the kid deals with it (similar to role playing). I found, our kids respond well to that sort of teaching. This book however, is more an enumeration of things one can do ""I can do this...."" and ""I can do that..."". I personnally found it a bit boring, and it didn't seem to reach out to the reader."
2,Could've been more specific,I really hoped to use this story to give ideas to some of my students on how to handle conflict. I wound up making up a story as to why they were arguing over the ball because the book itself is so basic and lacks creativity. I love the illustrations and it does open up the floor for conversation for the kids to add their own creativity.
4,Very entertaining,"The sound is fairly good and all the tracks are very entertaining. Includes a version of ""Gloomy Sunday"" (without the cop-out third verse)."
3,Victoria at Table With Family and Friends,"This cookbook is wonderful in many ways, but I do wish there were photos with more of the recipes. Her Butterfly Fairy Cupcakes recipe was a disappointment in many ways, but I think they would at least have looked prettier if I'd had a photo to guide me with the applying the wings. However, as a book to sit and down and read, it is truly delightful. And I do plan to try more of the recipes."
5,Gonzo travel adventure,"Well, move it on over Phinneas Fogg. Around the world in eighty days just doesn't cut it anymore! Join these two lunatics, the intrepid Chalmers and Valvur, as they tear around the planet in a 17 day pursuit of glory and cold beer, not to mention hundreds of arcane tasks which must be completed to win the most unique scavenger hunt of all time. These guys are nuts: highly adaptable, courageous, stupid, cunning, energetic, and numbingly exhausted as they wend their way across 4 continents, stubbornly refusing to admit that winning this race really nets them nothing except for the richly deserved bragging rights they earn as perhaps the craziest tourists many parts of our world have ever encountered. Put them up there with Stephens and Catherwood, Lewis and Clark, Stanley and Livingston, and Laurel and Hardy. Funny, insightful, irreverend, and ultimately charming. I had a blast reading this book, and you will too."
2,good watch. very poor light,"i wanted a watch that i could wear for dress occasions, that had both analog and digital features. after searching through amazons five thousand watches i found this one. the plus feature is that is one of a handful of watches that has a stainless steel case and bezel, many watches are just all plastic, and i dont like that. the first drawback is that the hands can only be adjusted by pressing a button and watching them spin around in one direction. the second is the light feature, which is very poor. it illuminates the dial on both sides but doesn't show the digital clock.its a good watch, but im very disappointed in the light"
3,"Pretty, water proof watch, but hard to read at night","I bought this watch for myself since it had the 3 features I needed: an analog display, digital timers and a lighted dial.Unfortunately, the watch is very difficult to read in low light situations. The edge-mounted internal LEDs not provide enough illumination of the light colored dial face, the chrome hands or the phosphorescent materials. The provided molded band is sized for large wrists. The mode indicator has such tiny, low contrast segments that it is very difficult to determine if alarms are enabled.I bought another model Casio watch with the same features, which had better mode indicators, but its LED illumination system has the same inadequacies."
5,Beanbags,These beanbags are very reasonably priced. Their construction appears to be solid for long lasting use. It is an added bonus that they have states and their information on them. My only recommendation would be to fill them a little more so they are a bit heavier.
3,"Yes, it's long, but is it any good?","Musicant's book doesn't really bring anything new to the table. He has done little research among the original sources, and none in the Spanish, Filipino, or Cuban source material, and has written what is largely a rehash of secondary source materials. This isn't to say that it's a bad book. Musicant's grasp of things military is very sound, and this is the strength of the book. The book is well written, although there are some jarring uses of words or phrases that simly don't match the tone of the book. Overall, I came away with the feeling that I had read a detailed overview of an important event, to which the author applied little analysis or originality. In particular, the book is very weak in its portrayal of the Cubans, Filipinos, and, to a lesser degree, the Spanish. Yes, it's an American story, but that doesn't mean you leave out the other protagonists in the drama."
4,"Very lively and thorough summary of a ""short, sharp war""","This book tells you everything you will ever need to know about which US soldiers and sailors fought where and with what weapons in 1898. If it has a weakness, it is in its treatment of the ""why"" questions. Certainly, there was strong pressure from the popular press, public opinion and several key figures in Congress and President McKinley's administration to sweep away the decrepit Spanish Empire in the Caribbean and Pacific. But it was one thing to intervene in Cuba, quite another to annex the Philippines - as was shown soon after the war when a popular revolt broke out against the US takeover. Musicant could perhaps have devoted more space to exploring the impulses behind US empire-building, and a little less to the rather confusing details of military campaigns whose outcomes were, let us face it, hardly in doubt. That said, it is still elegantly written and a good read."
5,holy mindblow,"A real acid trip! This novel reads like searing poetry. I don't know if the author is a novelist or a poet, but whatever he did, he had me thinking about his book for days afterwards like a weird dream I couldn't shake. Jeremy Needle has just joined the forefront of the novel noir vanguard of on-the-edge writers like Will Christopher Baer. Highly recommend if you are interested in the bleeding edge of new fiction."
3,hide and creep,"I got the movie for my son, and his friend. They loved the movie,I haven't seen it. It's not my type of movie."
4,this is worth seeing,"i really liked this movie. there wasn't much gore. there wasn't anything scary. but there were very funny lines. it was made on a low budget [well, at least they didn't use the money on the film]the acting was very good, throughout. good charactorization, and the camera work was always well done. they had no great f/x and the back drop is just a little town.zombie infestation hits a backwater town on a weekend when the sheiff is away. this means that the characters have to handle the problem themselves."
3,Someone in AL watch Shaun of the Dead,"A dark comedy and satyr poking fun at zombies, red necks, and fans of zombie movies. Not the best in speacil effects, scripts, or directing but worth the watch."
3,Spanish playing cards,"These were the cheapest Spanish playing cards I could find online, and even though they weren't inexpensive, I was disappointed with the quality. The pictures and colors are rudimentary (nothing in comparison to a deck of Bicycle cards). I probably look a little harder next time I'm in the market for some cards."
1,Dangerous Pseudoscientific Hogwash,Marrin isn't the only author of crap-tastic pseudo-scientific fantasies like this. But don't buy this. Don't waste your time on it. It's not entertaining. It's not useful. It's a waste of money.
2,Car Emblems: The Ultimate Guide to Automotive Logos Worldwide,"When a book contains ""ultimate"" in the title you expect it to be inclusive of the entire subject. Ford ""crest"" emblems were not even mentioned or illustrated. That was about 32 years of emblems not covered. Also, more history about the reasons a company chose an emblem or made a change to it would help."
3,Grey Card,"I am the purchase agent not the end user however, my order with Amazon was easy, informative on the product and delivery arrived as promised."
3,Good but could be better.,I found this book to be a good starting point but by no means comprehensive. It really could use a more complete treatment of the logistical aspects of creating an RMS. It gives a good overview of determining your needs but lacks when it comes time to set up the actual system.Table of Contents: Introduction. Why Your Company Should Start a Records Management Program 1.Getting Started 2.The Records Management Evaluation 3.Analysis of the Data 4.Your Recommendations for Change 5.The Report and Your Presentation 6.The Records Inventory and Retention Schedule 7.Disposal of Old Records and Protection of Essential Ones 8.The Off-Site Records Center 9.Effective Filing Systems for Today 10.Forms Management 11.Image-Reduction Options 12.The World-Class Records Manager AppendixA.Sample Records Management Evaluation AppendixB.Procedures for Developing a Records Retention Schedule AppendixC.Feasibility Study for Optical Disk Image Reduction
3,"Okay, good for young readers but very simple plot","I found this a very quick read. The characters are a little too predictable. I read this in one evening, very fast book to read. It does slow down in parts and the main protagonist is saved a little to often; but hey its science fiction/alternate history. I did enjoy it and recommend it to folks who want a little light reading. More serious readers may want to give it a pass."
1,Very average,"For most part John D. presents boring, soulless pounding with no sign of intelligence,style or even pattern. He had a couple outstanding moments in his career, but last couple of years have been disappointing..."
3,Average,"John Digweed, one of the biggest pioneers of dance music as we know it has finally released a new dj-mix compilation. However, after a few listens, I want to know, ""What Happened?"" The main problem I see with this mix is that it doesn't flow. Digweed weaves together a bunch of different house genres that just don't flow together. We have minimal techno, glitchy house, dark electro, some progressive/trancey house. I wasn't expecting another Global Underground: Los Angeles, but I was expecting something more. I recently saw Digweed in New Orleans, and I left that set with the same feeling. Digweed is changing his sound--I don't blame him, and its just going to be a matter of time until he falls into place with it. This isn't a horrible CD by any means, but it definately wasn't worth the 20 dollars I spent on it."
3,not quite,"well i really like most of the mixes from digweed that i've heard, in particular (of course) the norther exposure series and he's done some very decent global undergrounds indeed. Bedrock is also very decent. of course when i found out digweed was releasing a new mix, i pretty much went out and bought it straight away. whilst i wasn't really dissapointed, i wasn't really impressed either. the cd starts out very promising, and ends very well but it's the main part of the cd, the middle, which seems somewhat lacking. some of the tracks are repetitive, some are repetitive and annoying. many of the tracks are just a repetitive beat with a few sounds thrown in, and an annoying vocal or something. there are times during this cd when you may ask yourself ""what was the producer of this track THINKING?"" but yeah it's not all bad. if you like Digweed perhaps you should chek it out...but I won't recommend it to anyone."
4,Almost Flawless,"If you have ever seen Digweed live lately then you would know the route he's been taking. I think this is an unbelievable mix. The way Diggers can drop the most random tracks one after another is like no other. The first time I listened I was not sure what to expect, but after listening to it for a couple of times I think it is absolutely genius. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because I dont believe a ""perfect"" mix exists. Highly, highly recommended."
3,okay.....maybe,"I love digweed and essentially everything he has done. I also love the way progressive has been going. What I don't like is this boring album. It lacks feeling. Okay for a mix, but not what I would expect from the man on a major release. His KISS 100 show is generally better than this."
2,"This is Digweed, you sure?","I personally love John Diggers and most of his audio, but, this is where it goes down hill! The recent albums had nice dark rythem to them, this is lacking in that dept! I thought it would be a nice set with crazy texture but apparently its not! I dont suggest getting this album if you were into the LA and Hong Kong set, for better music try the new hernan Renaissance 2, that was a killer set!"
4,This is True Science!!!!!,"FABRIC 20 stunned me! I never know what to expect from DIGGERS. I have listened, dissected, and analyzed this mix, trying to discover Digweed's secret formula. My result, True Science! Again, Digweed leaps past all barriers, pushing house music to a new plateau. This mix intrigues, hypnotizes, and engulfs rich electronic frequencies that flow all the way through. Weird and haunting soundscapes combined with driven bass lines. Digweed's track selection is sweet. He starts with a fresh vivid track called ""Strive to Live"" slowly blending his way towards the dimness of Billy Dalessandro's track, ""In The Dark"". Here, I really start to dig the mix. ""In the Dark"" grabs your attention and starts the momentum of Digweed's venture. Digweed pushes further with Martin Solveig's ""Rocking Music"" and gets into heavy rotation with Slam's ""Lie to Me"" and Infusion's ""Better World"". Excellent TRACK! Digweed blends a stunning set, once again distinguishing himself from the rest of the world."
1,Doesn't work well,"It looks very nice and is pretty easy to load, but it doesn't keep the tea in the ball. Tea leaves fall out as you're steeping and they end up in your tea. Doing some cleaning and I just tested it again and decided to throw it out. I use one of these most of the time nowFORLIFE Extra-fine Tea Infuser and Porcelain Dish Setand occasionally one of theseHIC Brands that Cook Snap Mesh Tea Ball Infuser"
4,Lots of colors and shapes!,"My sons recently started liking Barney, I think because he is a dinosaur which obviously makes him cool. ""Barney Shapes & Colors All Around"" is a great DVD for all young kids because it goes though the colors of the rainbow and different shapes kids see throughout the day. It really does make learning fun and is very visual which is great for kids. There is lots of singing of course and even dancing! I love that the DVD not only includes Barney but also Baby Bop and BJ because I think it makes the show more exciting. It is almost an hour long DVD which is nice because it is not too short nor too long. I like to play this for my 2 year old when my older son is at school, hoping that he will get a good start on his colors and shapes! Its funny how when Barney talks about colors and shapes, my son listens and enjoys it as when I try to work on them with him!"
3,Giving it 3 stars for this VCD,Too much dialogue and not enough songs which my grand daughter likes. She is bored with too much dialogue. Will look around the other Barney VCDs
2,Scam,"Got the DVD sealed but really looks bootleged. CD covers look like they were printed from a computer and vary in shade. This DVD looks really fake, some episodes wont even play or have chunks missing."
2,"pretty good season, horrible packaging","here we go! finally comedy central decided to do like adult swim and cheap on their dvd sets. like some people before me state, the packaging is much cheaper. i wouldn't go as far as to say it looks like a bootleg, but the cardboard case is slimmer and my disks came SCRATCHED in PLASTIC BAGS. anyone else have this problem? in any case, i'm returning mine and i will not, repeat WILL NOT, buy another cartoon collection is comedy central and adult swim want to be cheap."
1,Unlucky 13,"This show gets dumber & dumber with each passing year. I mean a superhero with a racist name,An American Icon:Mickey Mouse bring branded as a villian,an episode with girls passing gas,a boy clueless about his ""kissing company"",an episode that uses the ""F"" word,a tsunami caused by pee and dumbest of all,an episode that spoofs the Smurfs. The only episode that I sort of like is the wrestling one but that's because I love wrestling and they spoofed it in a predictable way. We know that wrestling's like soap opera. Big Fat Hairy Deal! I give Season 13 a 1 out of 10."
1,CRAPPY BOOTLEG.,They sold me a crappy bootleg copy of southpark. The second and third discs didn't even work!
3,LOVE SOUTH PARK,NOW I COMPLETLY LOVE ALL SOUTH PARK BUT IF THIS DVD WAS EVER THE FULL PRICE I WOULD NEVER EVER PURCHASE IT FOR NEARLY 60 DOLLARSTHAT IS WAY TOO MUCH FOR 2 DISCS
3,Be Careful,"I bought mine brand new from Amazon, shipped by Amazon too. They came sealed, however, they did not come with the flyers/Comedy Central ads/Code for South Park: Tower Defense Play that another person who bought it the exact same way did."
3,The worst of South Park,"This is by far the worst season of South Park to date. There are only a couple decent episodes in this entire season... and those that were the most popular, like ""Fishsticks,"" were also very overrated. The Coon, WTF, and Pinewood Derby were all especially bad. Coming after the also-weak season 12, and season 11 which was pretty hit-or-miss... I was starting to think they had just simply run out of good ideas. Season 10 was one of their best ever so I'm not sure what happened to them after that. But so far season 14 has been great... so I guess this one was just a temporary lull. Hopefully they'll continue pushing the envelope and poke fun at Muslims and Muhammad some more in the future so that this show remains relevant. As for this season... well... honestly this is the first season of South Park that I'm buying because I'm a completeist, and not because it was truly exceptional TV."
5,South Park 13th.,"As far as the content, you either like South Park or you do not. I will say that Amazon.com had the best price on this product and the shipping was fast. The DVD`s arrived in great condition and I am completely satisfied. I will definitely buy from Amazon again."
3,southpark season 13,"i love south park very much but i can not watch it on any of my dvd players or consol systems, disk one only worked once and i had to change lots of setings on my coputer to make the disk work whitch was very time consuming. I will probly buy from amazon again but will make sure it works in my rejon befor i buy."
1,South Park DVD,False description on this product did not get what I oredered and did not have any infomation on what type of DVD continental player it would work on.
3,This is a Non Review,"I can't review this item because it was a gift to my son. I've never actually seen any of the episodes. But if you like South Park, you'll probably like this."
5,everything it says it would be,"You saw the show on tv. You could watch them all for free on their website. but the dvd offers you something tangible. Say they censor or remove videos from the site. You'll always have a copy of how it really was. nice to hear slightly longer commentary tracks, and anything else it says it has in the description rest assured its there. Lets hope season 14 dvd will give us the proper version of everything."
1,This is not the traditional Box Set,"I'm giving this negative review based on the deception of the product description. The product states that this is a box set. However, when my order arrived I received a single plastic DVD jewel case that consisted of three DVDs. I called Amazon and explained that I did not receive the standard DVD box set as advertised. I sent it back and they indicated they'll send the box set. Once again, they sent the same single plastic DVD jewel case. After contacting Amazon a second time they stated that they do not have the standard box set.If you are an avid South Park fan as I am and looking to enhance your South Park collection, DO NOT BUY THIS SET. If you're not looking for the traditional box set and don't mind the plastic single jewel case then this DVD may be for you."
2,Cheap Knock-Off Version Received,This is not the standard box-set that South Park has used for seasons 1-12 and 14. This was a cheap plastic 3-DVD case with the episodes printed on the inside of the single-page cover that is completely different from the one pictured in the Amazon ad. I am returning it and I'll go to a brick-and-mortar store to get Season 13 to be sure I am getting what I intend.
4,An Enjoyable Read,"The hero is a rich, suave, handsome and gorgeous hunk and the heroine ( as always in Lynne Graham's books) is a sweet, beautiful and wimpy virgin. There is a misunderstanding which prevents the hero from openly admitting his love for her and instead, treating her with cold disdain because he hates the idea of being forced into marriage with the heroine although he's in love with her. The chemistry between them is actually very strong and there is great sexual tension. Later, the love scenes are very passionate. The plot is more refreshing and credible than the writer's other stories and mosre satisfying."
5,I've read this book a dozen times and never tire of it!,"This was the first by Lynne Graham that I ever read. I immediateley began searching for more! From the very beginning I was enthralled by Leigh (the heroine)and Nik,the sexy Greek husband she fell for the moment she saw him!At seventeen, Leigh marries Nik Andreakis thinking that he is marrying her for shares in her father's shipping line. Five years pass and Leigh, now in love with another man, decides it's time for a divorce. After all, thier marriage isn't a real one and he lives the adulturer's dream existence. Leigh then finds that there never were any shipping shares...and after five years, Nik has other ideas for this marriage than divorce..."
1,Wow...talk about bad!!!,"I really hesitated in buying this book and the reviews were almost all depreciating but, I just had to see what it was about. Yes, this book is actually painful to read and the actions of the h/h were definitely cringe-worthy. Normally, I enjoy Lynne Graham even the older books, however, I cannot emphasize enough NOT TO PURCHASE this story!"
3,The Unfaithful Wife,It was a very interesting read. The characters had great personalities. Once you start reading it is hard to put down.
1,Poor Copy,"Buy The Cutting Edge and The Cutting Edge, Chasing the Dream. Don't bother with this one. It is, at best, a very poor rewrite of the previous stories. That doesn't begin to convey the disappointment you will feel while watching this movie."
4,Ice Skating,I enjoyed this movie it was more like the first Cutting Edge. Have been waiting for this to be on DVD since number 3 came out.
2,why so much bickering,Very disappointed. SOooo much bickering and fighting and not enough skating. It's worst than a reality shows. Why there cannot be movie about a sport (Especially figure skating) that my daughter can watch and people are actually nice to each other.
5,CUTTING EDGE; FIRE AND ICE,"Loved it better than the first Cutting Edge! I saw this one first and then several days later, then the 1st one was on tv and I watched it. Brendan Fehr put more excitement into playing the part of the hockey player than the other guy. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie."
3,rating for cutting edge: Fire and Ice,this DVD turns out to be the same story with different actors as the other Cutting Edge movies. Reviews were misleading.
2,A disappointing addition to an otherwise good franchise.,"This movie simply lacks connection; the characters themselves have no real rapport and the storyline lacks depth and does not engage the viewer. The casting has a lot to answer for. Very disappointing. However, if you like the other three movies in the franchise, you should add this one to your collection for prosperity."
4,Refreshing new product,"Although I have not yet seen the product ""in action,"" I am told my the parents of the children that the 3 year old loves this toy as much as the one year old--for whom it was intended. That speaks well to me for an interesting push-toy. Having sent many of these types of toddler-walking-pushing wagons or cars, it was really fun to select a product that was different and from a newer manufacturer."
4,readable for a text book,I bought this book for a class I was taking. Interesting book and fairly easy to read and understand for a text book.
5,college textbook,"The bookstore was sold out, and I needed this book for my homework. Amazon got the book to me just in time."
5,THE Essential Resource on Musical Theatre History,"This book is a must-have for people who work in, study, or love the musical theatre. When did a particular musical open? Who wrote it, and what else did he/she work on? What was the chronology of a performer or director's stage career? Were there revivals, London productions, tours? Who starred in a given production? While there are many books that can help find such information, no other book does it as efficiently. As a Broadway producer's assistant and as a life-long theatre buff, I have found this one-volume Encyclopedia a vital source of information. While all of Stanley Green's books are informative and entertaining, this is the one I turn to when I need the facts or figures fast. If musical theatre trivia is your bag, this is one of the motherlodes --I recommend it highly!"
3,Easily pleased,"So, the encyclopedia is great for music theatre knowledge. It gives great, to the point and concise answers to people, shows and songs of the theatre. I also enjoyed the comparisons between what happened on West End and what changed or continued in the Broadway seasons. The only issue I had was that it was written in 1975 and has not been updated so any show or song written after that recieved no mention but it's great for anything before that"
5,Noah,"The Ninth Generation: Conquering the GiantsWriting a novel set in the pre-flood earth is a daunting task with few historical resources other than the Bible, and not much said in Genesis to describe this epic period. Ellen Traylor has done a masterful work of imagineering to transport the reader into the lives of the early patriarchs and into a world of such evil that it had to be erased, later forming the basis for many legends. I was particularly fascinated with her geography of the early earth - ""Adamlanda""[or ""Atlantis""]- and the genetic alteration of creation, which I have also written about in a somewhat similar novel, The Ninth Generation: Conquering the Giants. After five years of personal research into this Biblical period, I agree with other reviews - Yes, it could have happened!"
5,Bible comes alive,"Novel based on the biblical story of Noah.Presents a world full of mythical, mystical creatures and the world of the Bible. It really comes alive with her storytelling."
4,Great intro to mcluhan,I found McLuhan difficult to follow. His ideas are spread on his thick books and sometimes it's hard to make sense of all of them at first. This book was a great intro to his work. It gives a good overview and reading the books afterwords becomes a fun pleasure.
3,Better off reading _Love Medicine_,"Louise Erdrich is a fine, accomplished writer. Somehow, it seemed to me that this novel exhibited signs of subject exhaustion. I believe that _Love Medicine_ is proof that Erdrich should be held in high regard as a writer, as the talent is truly there. That work also served as a template for some of her later works, a fact which I am a bit disappointed by since I feel that none of them have achieved the same level of poetic impact. _Tales of Burning Love_ is well written, but I feel that the story drags in places, and can be tedious to sit through; it helped that I read the majority of it while riding the bus. I was sorry to see her using the same characters again. They are strong, worthy, and well-developed characters, but in the context of this particular story they seemed more contrived."
3,Odd...but good,"This is a really odd book. I went from being bored to the point of putting it down, to leaning forward in my chair with anticipation. I'm glad a hung with it. I love her words and her style and she does a good job of telling a story from a man's point of view, but some of the scenarios in this book are just kind of out in left field! I thought of John Irving more than once as her characters found themselves in bizarre and embarrassing situations. Overall I would say that it was a good book, but The Master Butcher's Singing Club is still hands down my favorite by Louise Erdrich!"
2,Like wading through a snowstorm,"I usually enjoy Ms. Erdrich's writing. In fact, I enjoyed the her phases, sentences and word choices throughout Tales of Burning Love but I had a real difficult time with this one. At times (very few times) the book had me rivited to my seat. -Jack Mauser trying to meet an old love in a convent. A house burning with Jack inside. A snowstorm.But too often this novel bogged down. Patching together the stories of the wives become difficult for me. If you've never read Louse Erdrich try The Beet Queen or Love Medicine."
3,Routledge Portuguese dictionary,"I am an English>Spanish>Portuguese translator and Portuguese dictionaries are hard to find. I had been using the Larousse which is somewhat limited, so when I saw this dictionary on Amazon I thought I had found something much better. I was dead wrong, this dictionary is just adequate and certainly no better than the Larousse, which costs a fraction of the price I paid for the Routledge. All I can say is that it is grossly overpriced--I would advise others not to spend $64 on this dictionary when you can buy the Larousse for $17.95."
2,Frustrating.........,"Let me begin by saying that the camera is the most frustrating thing I have ever experienced. Every time I wanted to do something I ended up looking up her skirt. The only gold in Red Ninja is the story. Electronic Gaming may have mocked it, but I can actually see it becoming a movie. Gameplay is a bit stiff and wall running is difficult to get started sometimes. RIght now I am in a level, where I have no idea what to do. I may be forced to use a walkthrough with this game. I would suggest to you people to buy it when it when the price comes down to $20."
3,Needed polishment...,"I think that if this game had more time to be developed it would have been great. I think that if the developers could make a remake with better graphics, a better camera system, a harder gameplay and more options it will be much better."
2,So Frustrating,"I tend to play a lot of x-box games, and ninja ones at that. They are generally fun. This one is definitely not. I just want you to know that I join a website just so I can let you know of my frustration. The camera angles are so annoying its hard to see what you are doing. The action is so so bad, but its pretty bad, because you die really quickly. It is also not a consistant game play, you can hit someone one moment, and do the exact same thing the next moment (while the enemy responds the same way) and not hit them, and then get hit. The play is not consistant. it would be so bad if maybe you could save when you wanted, after you get passed a hard spot, but you can't, they take you back and you have to do it all over again and again. This game is so incredibly frustrating, not even a fun frustrating, because I like a challenge, but just a horrible frustrating. Good luck."
5,Great modern-day samba from Brazil,"Leci Brandao ""Somos Da Mesma Tribo"" (Movieplay, 1996)This is a great album from Brazilian samba traditionalist Leci Brandao. Brandao's career dates back to the early 1970s, but this late-'90s album shows her in top form. Recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
3,Could be better,This book is pretty good except for the fact that there wasn't enough action in it. It was all one mission that went to hell with the SEALs beating back the odds. (We all knew that they wouldn't all be killed.) This is the most boring book in this series.
3,"This is a good book for a flight, but lacks true insight.","I travel a lot, so quick books of this nature are welcome. The plot and the characters are a bit shallow but there's enough depth there to make the story work. If anyone is looking for real insight into the Seal community I strongly suggest any of the books by Chief James Watson, Gary Smith or the original Rouge Warrior."
5,Welcome to Ancient Greece!,"This book constitutes a superb visual tour of ancient Greece, beginning with the earliest artifacts and continuing through the Roman period. With abundant pictures, maps and drawings it is a feast. The text should not be slighted; it is up-to-date and highly informative, yet an entertaining and enjoyable read, and interposes many quotes from ancient sources to add depth. The book serves at once as a reminder or the glories of Greece, a reference for much of Greek culture, and a doorway to further inquiry. It is not an in-depth scholarly analysis, but a wonderful excursion through Greek culture that will lead you to greater understanding and a thirst for more. Finally, the book itself is a pleasure to see and hold. It will serve for many years as a reference and a place to browse through history."
4,"A basic, watered-down, beautiful illustrated Introduction to Ancient Greece","If you want a great coffee table book on the Ancient Greeks, this is it. The information is distributed in small, easy to digest chunks - there is nothing that will offend the senses. It is beautifully illustrated with amazing photographs, illustrations, and maps.More serious scholars or those who want to learn more about Greek culture than the bare minimum - this would be a pass (well, the pictures are *really* nice)."
2,Nice but boring,"My 3 year old is a big fan of The Cat in The Hat so I was thrilled to find this software. While it's amusing both he and I were very quickly bored. The book is ""read"" to you and then you get to interact with the images on the page, but there are very few actual ""games"" and even those are uninteresting. Objects and characters move, speak or do silly things when you click on them but nothing is challenging or requires any thought. There are a few exceptions (on one page you can rearange a portrait on the wall, on another make the cat balance more items...) but it's just nothing interesting and there's not enough..."
3,Products works but could have been thicker,Received everything in a timely way. Was satisfied with the company. So far the pads seem to be ok. The plastic barrier does not seem to be breaking down as others I have owned did. I am a little disappointed in the thickness of the pad but so far it works. I use them under my bedridden husband who is incontinent. If I order again I will buy a larger thicker pad.
1,Rough on skin,These pads absorb but are the most uncomfortable pads I have ever used when the skin directly touches the pads as it will if you are wearing shorts or short robes. I would never purchase this brand again.
4,Works well,"It works for the purpose, as intended. It is a useful item, can be moved to chair or bed when needed."
4,"Flicka, Ricka, and Dicka and the New Dotted Dresses","I sent the book ""Flicka, Ricka, and Dicka and the New Dotted Dresses"" to a grown-up daughter who loved the story when she was a child. She had worn a Dotted dress, and so did her 3 sisters and her neice. I made dolls with their faces on them, and dressed the dolls in dotted dresses made from their dress. The story is a memory gem, and I was glad to find it, even though it was out of print. Thank you."
5,"Flicka, Ricka, and Dicka Back For Fun","Flicka, Ricka, Dicka books have been republished. The classic Swedish stories from the 1930s bring wonderful tales of three Swedish sisters and their adventures together. Charming and always have a sweet lesson. Classic drawings will make it fun to read and discuss with children of this generation. In this adventure they have new dresses, but during the day's work helping another, they find they should have worn work clothes."
4,Swedish Triplets,"The Flicks, Ricka & Dicka books are a bit old fashioned but the adventures of these winsome triplets are still popular with my 4 & 5 year old nieces."
4,Great inexpensive vintage watch,Received it few days ago and love it. I think it is a great watch for the price. I purchased it in silver color and would love to get one in gold because I love that vintage look.
3,Casio digital Watch,"Watch is a very thin digital. Besides time, it has a an alarm and a stop watch function. The only limitation is that although the case looks like metal (chrome) it is plastic. If the case hits something hard or sharp, the band bracket breaks."
2,Small,"This watch is very small, I am 5 10' and 180 pounds and it just looks weird for me to were. For any MAN buying this watch it might look weird on you and you should look at a ruler and the size before buying"
4,great retro watch,"Awesome watch... had this one when I was a kid. Saw @ target during a roadtrip and bought it @ amazon when I got home. Quality is fair, not as heavy as I thought. The light in it is also pretty weak, unlike the stock pictures. But the overall value is very good, affordable, and it looks sooo freakin good. At this low price it is a steal.cheers"
5,"Excellent, just as advertised","Bought when my simple Casio with plastic band broke. New band cost close to the $10 watch. Found bracelet watch for not much more. I have small wrist and this is great. Bracelet easily adjusted w/o tools, just a paper clip. My wedding present 55 years ago was a small Rolex oyster with latch over type bracelet (now selling at $6,000!.) At $15 this one is just fine. I admire it many times a day."
3,casio watch,"This watch will be a Christmas gift for my husband. It's replacing a Casio he's had for 10 years which is getting to the point the buttons don't always work to set the time, date, etc. He likes the old watch, so I hope the new one suits him. I would give it more stars if he were using it now and could give his opinion. Casio is a good brand."
3,Not WR to 99 feet,"This is a decent watch. However, I bought it from Amazon based on their description that it is water resistant to 99 feet. It is not. It is minimally WR to splashes, but they do not recommend wearing it e.g. when washing a car. So....if you need something more water resistant, this is not the watch for you. Guess I will have to be very careful."
3,Casio A158W review,"Pros: classic watch, has light, inexpensive, band is easy to adjustCons: band is not steel, does not display month, not water proof"
3,pretty good,"this watch looks good, and works well; being a very inexpensive watch, perhaps one should expect something lacking--that something is the bracelet: it is very uncomfortable; so much I actually cut half of it off, and have the watchsitting on the dash of my truck, where it serves my purposes, without irritating me. dwh"
5,REALLY RETRO WATCH,"I searched high and low for a Casio watch like the one I bought many years ago that finally gave up the ghost. I had no success till I searched Amazon and there it was: a virtually identical watch. It's comfortable AND accurate; I'm wearing it now. It's a nice casual-dress watch that can go dressy in a pinch. The price was retro, too!"
3,Casio Men's A158W-1,"This watch is as described by other reviewers--perfectly adequate for the price--light weight, easy to set and read, and comfortable on my husband's wrist. I had not noticed that the clasp is not the standard fold and snap-on clasp usual to men's watches but a latch more often seen on women's bracelets--he finds this a drawback. Otherwise, not a bad watch for the price.NB: less than 2 months later, the latch has fallen off the bracelet rendering the watch useless as a wristwatch. A better clasp would improve this product."
5,Perfect,"I just bought it because of the retro look, i like Casio watches and this one is rellay nice.My other watches are bigger but you get use to this one. No regrets at all!The light is good enough to see the time, you don't need to illuminate the whole room. The other are just standard features that every watch should have."
4,Best gift,My nephew loves it. I don't know why we have to have a minimum amount of words to write a review.
1,casio watch,It is Hard to set the time and date. quality of watch not that good. Would not recommend the watch.
3,Casio Watch great buy,Portrayed exactly as described and pictured. The only disappointing thing was that it was a littlesmall and snug on my husbands wrist. Other than that he loved it.
2,"Ok it's cheap, but price is ok compared to the quality of the watch","Let's say that you'll have what you pay: a 15$ watch whose backlight is crap. And by crap I mean that you can have light just in the top left corner.Except for that it's ok, it works, but still unusable at night."
2,Disappointed,"The watch itself looks more like a child's watch than something a grown man would wear. It appears to work so we will keep it, but we certainly would not buy it again."
4,Childhood memories,"Quick delivery. Upon receiving the watch I realized why I was drawn to this watch. As soon as I put it on I realized I knew all the buttons and that it is the same as my first watch I ever owned as a kid back in the early 80's in Eastern Europe. Brought great memories of being proud of that little thing. However, it is much smaller than I remember and much smaller than anything I wear now. It feels like a lady sized watch. Still a good throwback though."
3,For price and expectations - great,"I've always wanted light up digital watch like this since I was 7. And that's exactly what this watch is.REMEMBER 3 stars means ""It's okay""pros:- tells time, day, and date- has an alarm clock, hour chime, and stopwatch- water proofed enough to stand being on the wrist while washing the hands, and up to 30 meters. (eg. no scuba-diving)- despite what other users have said, I've run the watch under a tap, and noticed no water- but it wasn't for very long.- it has a light- the band is easily re-adjustablecons:- the metal feels cheep and flimsy- the light is only one side, not evenly lighting the face of the watch.- and finally - this is a personal one which won't apply but to guys - if you're a hairy dude, the watch links will catch and pull every once in awhile, so be sure to not be too touchy about it."
5,Casio watches are accurate with long battery life,A great watch for a fantastic price. It's an accurate time piece with exceptionally long battery life. I have several Casio watches and like them all.
4,"HOP, STOP & SLIDE","This Video is best suited for families, mainly, parents who want to exercise with their children. I love the music!"
5,187 on yo a-hole,"Probably one of the best soundtracks ever made, period, when it comes to a genius masterpiece of music combined with the scenery of the movie. I reccommend getting the movie and the soundtrack cuz the movie really is a have to see film and after you see the movie you really understand the music and how good it goes together."
3,Not quite hard,"""Not easy but not really hard. It is a step above the Green Belt which is what you'd want in the progression."" Thus saith my husband, doer of Sudokus."
4,Good place to begin on hard sudoku's,"I've never played Sudoku until a couple of days back when I picked up this book. I'd heard about the game and I just picked this up to test it out. With the result that I've been stuck with the book since I got it!The game is fun, challenging and can keep you busy for hours, especially if you have a book like this that has hundreds of them. To be sure, the brown belt Sudoku is not easy; it says ""hard"" on the cover, so depending on your taste, you may want to start with the lower ""belt"" version in these series. If you think you can handle it or are familiar with the game, then go ahead and get this one.Would have been nice if the book had more history or facts on the game. There could also have been more tips and strategies listed in the beginning to get you started. This book however gets down to the tacks: its a collection of puzzles and thats all. I still ended up liking it though; its a great passtime."
4,informative,Lots of information about the history and all things you will find on the island. A great reference. Great color photos of shells to use with the kids!! So much info!
5,Fantastic guide to the Islands!,"I love this book! My family is planning a second visit to Sanibel this summer, and we have gotten so much helpful information from this guide. The information and reviews are quite thorough...the pictures are awesome! We can't wait to go back to the Islands and try out some new sights, restaurants, and much more...Thank you, Neal Family!"
5,Didn't know there was so much!,"Excellent book! We have been to Captiva about 10 times and just love it there! The statement in the book regarding crossing the causeway is so true, I giggled to myself. I'm heading to Captiva in 4 more days and wish it were sooner! . I'll be on Captiva for 14 days and as I go through the book, I'm not sure I'll be there long enough to accomplish all of the things there are to do on Sanibel and Captiva. I'll be planning out our days, but also making sure there are some days of just sitting on the beach enjoying as it states in the book. Thank you for sharing your secrets with us and for the insight you provided regarding the islanders feelings. It's important for those of us who come visiting keep the island the way it is meant to be kept. If you are planning on going to Sanibel and Captiva, this book is a must. So much more to do than sit on the beach like we have done and enjoyed for the last 10 visits. We'll be looking for those buried treasures!"
4,Well worth the money!,"Wow! This is a really great book. We're going to Sanibel Island for the first time and couldn't find any travel books that would give us the lowdown on where to go and what to do - until this book! It gives you a ""must do"" intinerary if you are planning on staying 3 days, 4 days, etc. It also includes tips for shelling: when to go, where to go and a comprehensive guide to help you identify what you find. I really enjoyed this book and it's now packed in my suitcase ready for the trip."
1,Just Confusing....,"I found this book very diffucult to follow. The steps are either incomplete, inaccurate, or improperly explained. Sometimes I couldn't figure out how to perform a particular pagemaker function, or I didn't understand why certain steps worked out the way they did. I have a fair amount of computer experience, and even a fair amount of pagemaker experience, but after reading through the first 4 chapters, I couldn't help but feel that this book was just put out to make money on the popularity of pagemaker and not better explain it. I wouldn't recommend this to users of any level. Pagemaker Adobe Classroom in a book is an excellent book for newcomers to the program. As for an good advanced pagemaker book, this isn't it."
1,Large book....but not very good,"There is a lot of text in this book, but that is as close to compliment as I'll give this book. Someone who has never used a computer before may find this book useful for the first hundred pages, and then will likely, like I did, become very frustrated with slow pace, and constant repetition of the basics. There was no need for this book to be 900 pages. Pagemaker, including all of its advanced features, could have been explained in far more detail in far less space. Reading through this book is a waste of energy, I'm sure some of the other pagemaker books out there are better than this one."
2,Doesn't look like a Lake Country backing plate,"This doesn't look a bit like the Lake Country backing plate that I bought from a well known online auto care site. Although neither of them have a manufacturer name on them, the one from the specialty site is thicker and has 6 rivets. Since that site is recommended by people who are really into car care, I'm pretty sure they are selling the real thing and that this is a cheap imitation. I gave it 2 stars because I suspect this will work OK, but it sure appears that it was misrepresented and I don't appreciate that one bit."
5,new fav,this is our new favorite game . I bought it for my son ina his wife. I have already bought another for my son in law. now I need one for us!
4,"Heartfelt, historical romance","If you like a good historical romance at the time of 15th century chivalry, this book is for you. This book has everything in a good romance novel... passion, longing, desire, villans, heroes, life-long vendettas, revenge. Even though the ending was somewhat predictable, it still held my interest and curiousity from the very first page."
2,didn't fit,"Ordered two of these for my laptop. They should have been so easy to install, but they didn't fit! They were off by a mm or smaller and just couldn't make it fit. Had to return items."
5,good product,"i asked for a computer geek -friend- to install and everything works how it should, great.....i will add more memory later in the year.. same brand..."
5,Plug and Play,Plugged this stick into my Toshiba Satellite A70 series and booted right up. Huge performance improvement over the orginal 256MB of RAM that was being shared with the graphics card. Great purchase!!!
5,Works great!,"Delivered on time, works as expected in an old Dell notebook. Speeds up operation going from 0.5GB to 1.25GB on Windows XP. Great value, would be happy to buy from this vendor again."
4,Portable Style,"I'm hardly flush with cash, so an Angela Adams wool rug is almost out of the question. But notebooks? Yes! I carry one in my handbag at all times for taking notes and planning schemes. My only gripe? I wish the covers were a bit more durable."
3,Good Watch,Good Watch overall. I like the digital and analog combination. Quality band. Con: the crystal seem to scratch easily.
4,Great Casual Sports Watch,"I use the watch for timing sports events. The count down timer is handy. The large numbers are easy to see and don't get hidden by the analogue hands. The face does scratch, so don't wear it while doing heavy work. Overall it has a lot of useful features for the price."
5,I am wearing it right now,I like the watch. It came in record time. I am at the age that I would like to be able to read the damn time with out having to put on my damn reading glasses. I can do this with this piece. It is also not soo complicated that I can actually figure it out. I have nothing negative to say about it
4,Great value,"I'll keep it short, I'm no watch expert.Pros: modern and light, water resistant to 100m is awesome.Cons: Plastic on metal band watches looks a bit cheap IMO and the buttons and accent above the band are plastic."
3,Enjoyed it while it lasted...,This watch is decent and rugged but the deal breaker was the rubber link at the end of the stainless steel band to the watch's crown which broke 11 months into continuous use.I couldn't find any one to fix the link so the only alternative for me was to either get a leather wristband which I loathe or reduce the wristwatch into a pocket watch which isn't fun.I ended up purchasing another watch on Amazon from the same seller (shopemco).
2,"it look good, but that's it.","it look very good ,but you have to extra careful , because it gets scratched-up very quick.and it is hard to setup."
3,Battery,I gave this a 3 rating because the battery lasted only a year. You cannot change this battery by yourself. To bring it it a jeweler to have the battery changed would cost as much as the watch cost.
4,Good watch for the price but a bit too small,"The watch looks pretty good with all the features I wanted, but the dial is a bit too small for my taste. Plus, like many reviewers' comment, the face ""crystal"" is easily scratched (on my first day). Well, I can't really complain for the price I paid."
2,Amazon lead me the wrong way,"I was shopping for a wrist watch that was auto setting time from Colorado Springs atomic clock. I was to Amazon, one of my favorites, and brought up watches and read the reviews. Amazon listed this watch as similar and I bought it. It is both analog and digital and has the date and day. It is not calibrated by Colorado and therefore shouldn't be catagorized with those that are. I got the watch and it looked good but setting it up was almost impossible, so I paid $5 to have it set. It is back lit and when I tried to read the time it would barely light up and the lost the day and date. Too finicky to wear it went to the bottom of the drawer. My fault for not reading every detail, Amazon's fault for grouping it with the right group of watches."
4,Awesome!! Super watch,This is great watch at throwaway price. I like it very much.Specifically the watch gets lighted up when you tilt it to look at the time
4,great watch,"Great watch for the price, has alot of features you'd expect if you were paying double or more for the watch. very happy with it, although I had to find a very small hole punch to adjust the watch band to fit."
4,Good stuff,"I love the watch. Looks good ( I like the look of an analogue face), feels good, and the back-light is great. I like having more than one alarm."
2,"Looks good, but no instructions on adjusting strap size","This watch seems to have all of the things I was looking for, especially a repeat alarm so I can log my activities during the work day. Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to adjust the (metal) strap to fit my wrist. I called Casio Customer Service, and spoke with a nice lady who assured me she would send me the neccessary instuctions via email. That was over a month ago. I guess I should call again..."
3,A so-so dual time watch,"I bought this watch because it looks similar to the Seiko Sportura watch. The quality is much lower, the background display is gittery at times and while it's fine for the price, it's cheap. So you get what you pay for (again!).For the money it's not a bad product though."
2,Not what is described,"I purchase watches with full metal cases because I am hard on them. The product description says it has a stainless steel case. This is misleading. The bulk of the case is plastic with a thin layer of metal over the plastic. Not a plating, but a thin metal case with the plastic case on the inside. Also there seemed to be a large amount of plastic and rubber involved with the watch band to case connection. The watch only weighs a few ounces, but is on the large size giving the impression of a very cheap watch. The kind you get for free when you order something from a catalog. This watch might survive a white collar lifestyle, but anyone that works with his hands would destroy this in weeks or shorter.As for the timepiece itself, it is legible, but I only had it for a few minutes before arranging for its return, so I have no idea how accurate it is."
4,Awesome Technology and functionality,"I would rather break my review in sub parts to make it easier for you guys :-Looks :- 4 / 5 : the metal strap and the overlook look is awesome But i must say , the green lights put me off in a way , i expected a silverish sort of light , so apart from the light display , no negatives at all for this watchFunctionality :- 5/5 : YOU CANT beat Casio when it comes to Funcitonality . It rocks !!Technology :- 5/5 : The auto light sensors and some of the other stuff in this watch is mind blowing ! this auto light sensor works in way that you just need to tilt your hand towards your eyes , and the watch lights up automatically for you to see the time......AWESOME !"
3,Casio Men's Ana-Digi #AQ160WD-1BV,"Not bad for a $30-40 watch. Aside from most common features in this type of watch, the countdown timer is a ""must have"" for any watch I buy. I have always like the dual analog-digi this one is good because the hands are small enough and the LCD digits big enough that the digits are never hidden. I often set the digits to GMT with the hands on local time and works great. The crystal is fairly cheap (obvious for the price paid) and will scratch over time. The alarm and timer sounds have reasonable volume. The hands are actually set through button menus (no rotating dial) and there is no analog second hand which I haven't really missed. My main complaint is the readibility of the digital display in low light. The picture makes the digits appear almost sky blue when they are, in fact a dark bronze color. The best readibility is either bright light, or using the illumination feature which is a little weak although I've seen much worse."
1,"Great features, terrible watch","The connection between the band and the bezel broke after barely a month. Casio's return policy isn't clear-- but boils down to you have to return it for them to evaluate whether they'll cover it. I refuse to pay money only to be told I have to repair an item that is almost brand new. It's too bad-- I really like the display but the quality is poor (too much plastic, I guess). I've since purchased a Timex that doesn't have as nice a display but is a metal case and seems more robust."
2,"Thick, unversatile","First, I didn't expect a skinny watch, especially at this price, but it looks/feels thicker than any watch I own, including my Casio WaveCeptor (atomic) watch. Clumsy and unattractive.Second, I expected the digital display to be a little more versatile. It appears the top (smaller) line can be either the day of the week, or the month and day. The second (bigger) line can only display the time. Well, that's stupid, as there's no reason to have the time always displayed both digitally and analogically. I'd like to have the top line give the day of the week and the middle line give the month and day. But that's just not an option.Finally, the only change you can make in the size of the bracelet is a one-time change making it 3mm smaller in circumference. Any more adjustment than that and you need jeweler's tools to remove a link.I expected better from Casio."
4,"Nice watch, bad belt","I have one purchased since 2006, it's very nice, I've never replaced the battery and I love the functions it has, the only problems is that it gets scrached easily and the rubber that conects the belt with the watch is very breakable, It happened to me and I was about to lose the watch in the middle of the street for that reason, for now I had to put it a belt with a diferent design that doesn't look very nice but at least I can use it, I'm still hoping to find a shop with a similar rubber"
4,"Great watch, especially for the price","I've had this watch for over a year and haven't had any problems. I haven't experienced any scratching of the face but it isn't my only watch and it isn't worn all the time. It is, however, my favorite style of ana-digital watch and would love to see more of this style, Something in more of a dive watch style with a rotating bezel would be very appealing. I had no problems adjusting the band; it's the usual mild pain in the posterior but doable. Setting isn't difficult. All in all, I'd buy one again if something happened to this one, and I'd buy this full-face ana-digital in other styles if I could find them. This style watch as a Casio Waveceptor would be irresistible. Please, Casio?"
4,"Almost a five, But great for price","Pros: It's an excellent watch, great alarm, chronometer, and count down. Also great looks and light!!Cons: Easy to scratch, plastic face, plastic body, but excellent metal risk band.Overall: For that price and all what it does!! Is just fine!!!"
1,nunca me llego este producto,mi criterio fue que nunca me llego el producto quisiera saber que ocurrio y gracias espero una respuesta no llego no llego
2,Disappointed!,"I liked the looks, general appearance and features (large numbers, time zones, multiple alarms, etc).However, within a year of purchase, and normal (NOT rough) use, I found that the lens scratched easily and the bracket (plastic) broke, allowing moisture seepage and, of course, releasing the band. The watch appeared to be all steel, but is in fact a mixture of coated plastic and steel.This is my second Casio to break in such a manner. I used to buy only Casio, as I loved its styling and features, but I am now avoiding the brand. This promised to be a good traveling watch (multiple time zones, etc). But having a watch break overseas is no fun!"
2,Didn't prove to be enough strong,"While snowboarding i fell and the watch-chain went completely separated from the main body. It is irreparable, because the plastic, which holds the chain and the main body got scratched and even if new bolts are placed they can't hold the chain and the watch firmly toghether.Quite dissapointed I am from casio and probably would never buy another watch from them."
2,Nice but too dark,To read the watch you have to position the display just right. It's Not a quick read for my old eyes! So I returned it and am looking for the Tic - Tock of
4,Not bad for the money,"The watch looks more expensive than it costs. It's nice to have both digital and analog displays. The digital display is actually quite subtle, so someone looking at the watch from the side won't notice it. The watch is fairly easy to learn how to use and has a lot of useful features (time zone, alarm, stopwatch). Also, keep in mind you will have to get the band adjusted somewhere, which can be rather pricey (we paid $12). We gave the watch only 4 stars instead of 5 because the face scratches rather easily."
1,This watch is far from electro-luminescent by me!,"This is false advertising at it's best. The analog hands don't light up and you can't see the digital part at night (the reason I picked this watch.) Electro-Luminescent is a joke. Shopmeko would take it back if I had all the packing and it was like new. I expected it to work and as far as I am concerned, was falsely represented and defective. You get three seconds to push the right button and read the digital time. This thing is a rip off. Don't fall for the lighted watch feature."
2,Good for a year,"I got this watch almost exactly a year ago. The metal parts are sturdy and dependable, but the plastic joints were what let me down. After a while one of the hinges snapped off and rendered the watch useless as there are no replacement bands for that. Also, I am still unsure how to get the analog interface to line up with the actual digital time. I read the directions several times. Perhaps the error occurred when I set the watch to NYC time, however they still get no points for ease of use.As for the people complaining that the watch is too big, you're either going to have to get a remover tool or take it to a jeweler and pay the $10 or so for the service. I'd honestly recommend something with all metal parts. I work my tools pretty hard, but I almost never blow out a watch in a year. My Timex Iron Mans always lasted 2-3 years before their bands blew out."
5,excelente producto,"excelente producto, envío muy rápido.buena atencion, tamaño ideal, lo recemiendo por completo a todas las personas que lo deseen, compra segura."
4,Perfect but quite small!,"Quite good watch with useful features, two small cons till now:1. Very lightweight, and quite small.. kinda childish :)2. Setting the analog clock takes some patience, not much though .."
4,Buena compra,A favor: Combina muy bien lo digital y lo análogo. Luce excelente. Super precio.En contra: Su carátula y rebordes se despintan con cualquier golpe. Debe cuidarse.Para el precio que tiene el balance es altamente favorable.
4,Great watch!,I bought this watch for my 17 year old nephew for Christmas and he loves it. I liked the fact that it looked sharp and was very well priced. I knew Casio was a solid brand and I had no hesitation in buying it. He loves it so it is a win/win situation.
4,Great watch,"This is a great watch. It looks cool, works well, and is pretty rugged. All for less than $35. My only complaint is that you can see the day of the week, or the date, but not both. The band is a little rough to adjust, unless you have a special tool: I found a push pin from my daughters' bulletin board was perfect!"
4,Nice,I brought this watch about 3 months ago and I liked it. I had to take some efforts in order to remove the unwanted links to shorten the belt but it has been working well.
4,Absolute value for money,The watch is absolute value for money with:Uber cool looks (Dual display: Analog/Digital)Pros:Fantastic finishTimerStop Watch27 Cities - World time5 Alarms with Snooze and Hourly SignalThe auto-light function is amazing where you tilt your hand to see the time and the back-light turns on.Cons:The Watch Crystal is plastic and not glass making it prone to scratches.I have removed one star for that.
3,"Cool watch, horrible crystal","I bought this watch to replace my Timex T56371, needless to say I was disappointed in the quality of the crystal. It scratched very easily and I couldn't read the time easily within a couple of months. The overall look and feel of the watch it very cool just not as durable as I would like."
5,Nice Watch,Its Value for Money. Watch is looks awesome & easy for set to your size. If you buy from Amazon & want set to your size than don't worry go to WALMART they will fix it FREE at jewelry department.Also great durable. Here is the example. By mistake within one week time of purchase I drop this watch on solid floor & hit badly but nothing happen to watch.Love the all features in watch.100% recommended.
4,Great Product,This is much more attractive product than it looks like in the image. This has having lot of features but yet simple to operate. Always recommend this product.
4,Good Sturdy Watch,Well made with good features. My only complaint is that the date doesn't appear on the face--only the day of the week.
3,Adjusting the watchband is a challenge.,"It comes way too big for the ""average"" man's wrist. We had to go online to find where someone posted how to remove links and it wasn't simple. We had to remove 4 links, two from each side. I think it would be better to send the watch to fit a more average wrist and then include extra links and detailed instructions to add them if you have a larger wrist. Or at least make it easier to remove the links, perhaps a special tool? Otherwise, the watch seems fine so far. It was a Christmas gift for our adult son and he seems to like it."
4,casio mens aq160wd 1bv ana-digi electro watch,I bought this watch at first to use then decided to use it as a gift for christmas to someone the face is a little small but its manageable. hard time figuring out how to change the analog without the wheel to do it.
2,casio watch,"to bulky and very heavy,difficult to set up, band does not fit.have had the watch only a few weeks would not recommend this watch"
3,Good,"Aesthetically the watch bracelet vee but its the only thing good was the glass that has been scratched very fast, but their roles very well. -"
2,Could do better!,"Lighting of numerals seemed kind of dim, changed battery and the results were the same, band kind of thin and felt cheap and not hefty like other watches I own, consider price and you get what you pay for. I think there are a lot better watches out there for around the same price range.T"
3,Casio Men's Ana-Digi Electro-Luminescent Sport Watch,"From the moment I opened the box, I just loved the look and feel of this watch. The only problem I have with it (along with alot of other reviewers) is the fact that the watch face is not crystal, it is plastic. This thing will scratch if you look at it the wrong way. I soon will not be able to see the hands on mine. I can't stress this enough, I scratched the face when I was putting my jacket on, and there were no buttons or snaps on my jacket. Anyway, other than the easy scratching, I love the watch. Get what you pay for I guess."
4,Great watch!,"Great watch with many great features. I love the size of the digital layout and the metal band is durable. To resize the band, push out the pins from the side that looks like screws.Pros: Accurate, good looking, multiple alarms, timer, and stop-watch.Cons: Metal band latch sometimes deforms, making it hard to latch. You have to bend it a certain way to make it work. The analog hands sometimes get out of sync with the digital time. You can fix that easily, but annoying sometimes. Lastly, at night you can't use the watch features. There is a light, but it occupies a button used for setting alarms and such. So if you are setting your alarm, you can't see the display. Timex has a night feature that, once enabled, turns the light on with every button press. My former watch had it and it was a very handy feature.Great for the price."
2,Good watch but disappointed,I was looking for a watch with both analog and digital outputs. I found this one that fit the bill. It wasn't very expensive so if it bit the dust at work I wouldn't mind too much. The only problem I found was the dial window. It's plastic. Soft plastic. Unfortunaly only a week after buying the watch I already had several scratches on the face that made it more difficult to see the face. If the dial window was more resilient I would be very happy with the watch and give it 4 or 5 stars but as it stands it gets a 2... barely.
2,Cheap construction,"Strap is either too loose or too tight, because the links are a little too big. Its hard to adjust at home and needs to be taken to a watch repair shop.Material used for construction of the body is cheap painted plastic that gets scratched very easily. The dial window is claimed to be ""Mineral"" but it certainly doesnt feel like that to the touch, and again scratches very easily.Seems to be showing accurate time so far, but then casio electronics are generally reliable.I would go for a more expensive casio model in the future which have better construction."
1,not too happy.,I did not know that the face was covered with plastic instead of glass and the silver paint around the face is already fading in jus 2 weeks of use.
1,What happened??,"I bought this watch looking forward to the fact that it had both analog and digital options along with a metal band. I received it and not a week later, it died. I thought that it must have been the battery and took it to get the battery replaced. The technicians replaced the battery and nothing happened. The watch had literally died. I looked to send it back because it was still in the 30-day return timeframe, but since I had worn it and because I had thrown the packaging away after it worked for a week (about the day before it died) it did not meet the qualifications of being returned ""unworn and in the original packaging."" I do not recommend purchasing this item due to its unreliability when it comes to actually working."
4,Good watch,Watch is quite good. Only problem is its big dial which I think is not much suitable for a person with small wrist.
2,Smaller than I thought,This watch is small. I though it was bigger. It also feels a little bit cheap. Well... it is cheap. I guess you get for what you paid.
4,"Nice functionality, but not built to be pretty for long","I bought this watch to hold me over until I can find ""the"" watch to replace one that died on me. So far, I love the functionality of this watch -- the timers, the automatic light, etc. All in all, it works really well and has a lot of neat little features.What keeps this from being a 5-star review (and, honestly, almost bumped it down to be a 3-star review) is that it's not built to last. The ""stainless steel"" band is, as others have noted, actually not steel at all, but rather aluminum. As such, it scratches very easily. After a month, it looks more worn than the stainless steel band of my previous watch, which I wore every day for ten years. Likewise, the plastic face scratches very easily; I don't even know how it got scuffed already, since I haven't bashed it into anything.For $25, it's worth the price. Just know in advance that it won't stay pretty for very long."
2,"Worth what I paid, but not more","This watch feels fragile and light, not at all strong and firm like I am used to from Casio watches"
3,Not a everyday watch.,"I bought this watch about 8 months ago. Love Casio as they give you a lot for little money. However just recently the case broke where the band pin fits in. I honestly think its a design flaw with the model as its made from a very brittle plastic and the pin hole is right where the mold is joined together. Like I said, I love Casio but I would get another model. Sooo sad that its broken. I have Casio watches much older and they still work."
3,Moderate,Nice lite but weak after getting i start to use but ten days later the pin which is used for watch strap dropped. That is the only thing that i can tell about it for the time being.
4,easily scratched,"I bought this watch for my son for his birthday, he's had it for 5 months and wears it everyday, it's very stylish and is also very functional, however the the glass and the entire watch except for the back and band are plastic, the band of the watch is stainless steel however the rest of the watch is plastic so it is very easy to scratch, overall its very nice but after a few months you will find the watch covered in scratches and paint from accidentally grazing walls and such."
4,Great Watch,"This watch looks great. It took me just a couple of minutes to figure out how it works, although the manual is pretty friendly as well. The watch fulfills all my needs and more, the back light is just great. The only thing with it is that the plastic cover is kind of delicate so it can get scratched pretty easy. Other than that, the watch is awesome and for a very low price. I'm a happy customer."
4,"Good Looks, Works, Buldgy","it's decent quality, works just fine, it's looks good, but the images are a little bit deceiving; it is bulgy, with the front part being smaller than the base, it forms a cone shape, that makes it look a little bit cheap."
5,Too Good,Its really too good. Perfect for men. Both analog and digital with being luminous. Silver color chain. Professional as well as casual.
4,Found it!!,"Okay I had been searching for the ""perfect"" watch for the past three months. I figured that if I wanted to buy something like this I had to take my time. (Plus I hate returning anything) Let me just start off by saying that this watch is a beauty. It had all the functions that I had desired in my watch hunt. However, future purchaser of this watch, I want you to know that their is a tremendous different between the watch that you see online and the one that you receive in the mail (by the way delivery is swift) The display and design of the watch online is relatively smaller than the one that you receive. The functions are very easy to learn. The display lights up very nicely. This watch has been in my possession for about a month and, could be that I am a careless person, but my watch has small scratches on the display. But you can hardly see them, so they do not bother me. But purchase this watch, it's inexpensive, a very light watch, beautiful display. Good Luck."
4,Need A Tool To Adjust The Watch Band,You'll need to buy a watch band pin remover tool to adjust the watch band. I bought one on ebay for $1.99. Otherwise a good watch.
4,Casio men's watch,Good product. Seems well made and accurate. The digital parts are poorly visible in ordinary room light unless the display is turned on. The delivery service was fast.
4,sencillo,"aunque de apariencia muy compleja, es de fácil uso, el manual en español esta muy bien presentado, aunque por el costo, la caja donde se vende debería ser un poco mas presentable."
3,Inexpensive watch bought for trip to Rome,I bought this watch because of its' multiple time zone and dual display function. For the price it was a good deal and at a price point I won't mind if it get's stolen in Italy by the gypsies or pick pockets. It is a combination of plastic and very light metals which equates to something easy to wear. Setting up the time function and dual displays was not an easy task but I finally got the key functions working. My only complaint was the ad made it look like the face was blue and it is actually black. One other issue is the size of the analog hands. They are just a little too thin and it makes reading the time difficult in the sun. One other thing to note is it is only water resistant so you can't wear it swimming !
4,bueno,"Excelente lo recomiendo, el producto me llego a venezuela en perfectas condiciones, y cubrió todas las espectativas ; lo recomiendo."
2,difficult to set up,"I'm having trouble setting the watch up; the back light, or lack of, is the problem. It doesn't help that the owners manual is tiny even using a magnifying glass. It's 2""x3 1/4"" and some dolt though folding it in half was a good idea. I pulled it up off the casio web sight and they have it set up so you can't enlarge it. I copied it out and cut it up and used a copy machinr to enlarge it 200% The type is about equal to a 10 point font but easier to read than the original."
4,Sticking with the Basics,Scanlan's book really helps students with little or no journalism experience build a foundation for news writing. It is the kind of text that students can keep and refer to throughout their collegiate and professional careers. It has sound exercises for students and good tips for teachers and writing coaches. It is an excellent book for introductory news writing classes.
3,Alert-Things Aren't What They Appear To Be,"NOTE: This is not the actual textbook. It is the workbook that accompanies the textbook. If I had known that before, I wouldn't have bought it. This book is pretty useless on its own."
1,BOOOOOOOO-RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!,"For some reason, I really HAD to have this game. Boy, was I in for a big let down. The single-player mode is boring, and you can't have any CPU controlled opponents. It's probably only fun if you have friends over. Nuff said."
2,Stay away Windows 2000 server users,"Although SMC states this product works well with all operating systems, I have attempted to install it with 3 different Win2K Server boxes to no avail. However, when hooking up to my laptops running Win98, and WinME, it runs superbly, throughout my two story home and even in the garage."
4,Great product that does what it promises,"Great connectivity, performance, and value.Out of 3 products I've tried, this is best. (Linksys was too weak on signal strength, Sohoware was too entry level).The only qualm I had was with it's wireless hub configuration utility. Utility does what it is supposed to do but I'd much rather have it working off of serial port or usb port for configuration (or somekind of internal webpage) rather than being restricted to wired network. (You can't configure it when you are on wireless notebook which kind of makes sense but simple USB or Serial connection could have saved this problem)."
1,No grey here--these are predators,"I cannot imagine who would find this delightful. Watching layers of losers try to take advantage of another group of losers was not fun, it was disheartening. I felt sad when it was done. If I was supposed to laugh at the inept and delusional musicians, I sure couldn't. They were mostly well-meaning and earnest people, sometimes overbearing but generally just young and not wanting to wait tables for their whole lives.No need for a long review. I felt soiled at the conclusion of this film. Not amused. Not entertained. Not informed. Just slightly bored and overwhelmed with pity for those vultures who prey on their weak and needy neighbors."
4,"Not a comedy. A great, touching, grim movie.","I really don`t get how some people considered this movie ""hilarious"". Maybe the first 10 minutes have funny spots, but after that don`t wait for laughs - unless you`re laughing at other people`s sadness.A grim movie, quiet and that develops slowly and smoothly, making little things seem so important and sometimes devastating - as they are in life, I guess.I don`t see this as a movie about ""the music industry"" either. it`s so much more than that. They could have written it to take place anywhere that it wouldn`t make that much of a difference (but probably would weaken it a little). To me it's about life, how people have hopes, and how others take advantage of that in so many ways.As I said, a sad movie, but moving, subtle and beautiful."
4,Bloody Brilliant,"In a word, this movie is very authentic. The audition scenes were performed by real people (not actors) without knowing it was actually a film shoot. Hidden cameras recorded the interactions between the lead actors and the unsuspecting musicians. What a great idea, and the end result is thought-provoking and worthy of all the praise this film has gotten. This is particularly going feel impactful for people interested in music and/or sales. My highest recommendation, and I would give it 4.5 stars if that was an option."
2,autogenic training,"If you are unable to get a grip to Autogenic Therapy by J. H. Schultz and Wolfgang Luthe (the original six books), you have to read Micah's book. But, remember: Schultz and Wolfgang Luthe are the masters. Their books were published between 1930 and 1973.I read those and are fresh and full of insights. Why copy the copy when you can go to source. If you are really interested in the subject, the book to acquire is the original Autogenic Training published in 1959 by J.H. Schultz and Wolfgang Luthe. Always, go to the source."
4,"Best ""Beatles"" retrorock","This cd-along with ""live at the Adelphi"" presents Pete Bests band performing a number of 60's standards live. The music is a fine trip down memory lane--or a good introduction to music from that era if it's new to you. Pete and his brother both play drums-so it's never quite clear which one you're hearing--so what? Is Pete a better drummer than Ringo? I don't know-they're both better drummers than me!!! (About the only way to clearly here Pete Best on the drum is on the Tony Sheridan/Beatles album or on the Decca audition tapes--on each of these-his drumming sounds fine to me) Actually, just listen to this for what it is--a good live performace of some great old songs."
3,Average Recording,The Pete Best Band is definitely ALLOT better than what this recording sounds like! It's rather ECHOy for lack of a better word.it sounds Ok but the echoing is on the annoying side.I can Honestly say they sounded really Fab in the Winchester Club in Lakewood a month and a half ago.If you are debating bout seeing the band from this recording DONT~Go See them!!!!!!!!!They are Allot of FUN!and really good!I told Pete it was a Great show! I knew I'd enjoy it I like the Beatles from 64 on back. But I really didn't expect to have that much fun!Was Up dancing with some of the other folks on the side for Twist & Shout.Pete asked if I'd come again!YES!!!!!!!!!!!Just wish that the CD sounded as good as they did in person!
1,Rip Van Winkle in a less-than-perfect world.,"Loftons' knee-jerk reactionary tale of black versus white, in a conspiracy laden immediate future, rides the crest of the Waco, Ruby Ridge, Oklahoma City bombing tide with Pat Robertson /Louis Farrakhan-esque jingo-ism for any shade you view yourself as. Written on a level barely suitable for a high-school senior, it's a good book to read on a flight when you have to choose between being bored to death, or just being bored to the point of drooling."
5,Amazingly good,"Impressive both with the detail in the beginning and the quality and fun of the story, I read AD in a single sitting. It's the type of sci-fi that scares you because of just how possible it is. It 's the kind of story telling that has you wishing for the hero to win in the end. I recogmend it to everyone."
1,Dud!,"You don't need a rebounder for this one. But you do need strong knees. It's mostly squats & squat-jumps on or off the rebounder. Then some very repetitive floor work. He stops constantly to 'check-out' his crew, complains about sweating, and has a very noisy crew member. Boring, dull, and rebounder-less!"
3,a OK book,"This book covers all useful topics about the UNIX, which is what I like. However, this book has many programs and command which are out-of-date. The author need to update new programming styles in the UNIX. The author does not give detailed explanation of the regular expresstion which is very powerful in vi, grap, ed and awk utility."
1,???,"I have not started receiving the St. Louis Magazine. If I begin to receive it, I will let you know how I like it."
1,Outdated and Ethnocentric,"This book was published awhile ago, and needs to be updated. I was particularly interested in the Middle East section, which this book called, ""The Lands of Islam."" The language was ethnocentric, with an orientalist attitude (see Edward Said for an explanation of orientalism). I do not recommend this for anyone interested in info for this region of the world; I have lived there and the information presented in this book is now incorrect, as the book is outdated."
3,Needs updating,"Overall, this book could use some updating. I think if I'd looked at the date of publication I might have thought twice about putting it on my wish list. It was published in 1997 - in other words, pre-9/11, and before it was common to use websites as resources. There are several chapters that are just plain common sense.The climate towards Americans has changed world-wide, the risks have increased.... and this book lacks links to Internet sites for the resources and agencies listed as helpful.It is, however, good for listing general customs and things to watch for in various countries. It isn't bad - it would just be a lot better if they did an updated version."
3,Do's and Taboos Around the World for Women in Business,Interesting for young very unexperienced women.
3,There are much better Toquinho collections,"I am a Toquinho fan since long ago and I say that there is no argument : Toquinho's technique is superb.Although I like some of the tunes in this CD, I like it better when he is playing and singing. This album is merely a basket where a few songs where tossed in.Also, the last track on this album is wrongly named. The correct is ""Revendo o passado"" by Freire Junior (Reviewing the Past)"
5,Great Read,"Being a lifelong fan of baseball and its history I loved this book for it's content about the National Pastime and one of its' greatest players. I also enjoyed the history of vaudeville and show business in the early 20th century.Mr. Hynd loves his subject matter and that comes through loud and clear in the book. He brings these two legends to life and paints a vivid picture of them as individuals, professional entertainers and lovers. I found it very hard to put this book down and highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good story as well as history.For me, if a book is well-researched and well-written it is a joy to read. Marquard & Seeley is a first rate book on both counts."
5,Entertaining Education!,"I purchased this software for my 4 year old son because I was getting tired of renewing it over and over again at the library! He would sit at the computer playing with this software for hours, if I would let him! A juice box and a bowl of goldfish and he'd be all set. :-)As big fans of all of the Learning Company titles, we knew we would love this one, too. Besides the wonderful rhymes from the beloved Dr. Seuss, there is sheer enjoyment to be had clicking all over the screen. The results are hilarious!To show you the software's appeal, my 10 year old daughter always seems to find an excuse to be near the computer when my son is playing this game, and the next thing you know, they're sitting in the chair together, having a wonderful time.An excellent piece of software, and I highly recommend it!"
5,Great for Dr. Seuss Fans!,I used to read my son the book since he was 2 years old and now that it's on software he reads/plays it himself all day. He really loves it.
1,Note to MacOS Uers: Requires Classic Mode (does not work with Leopard!),"Please note that the Mac OS version requires use of Classic Mode, and it does NOT run under Leopard (10.5 and later). Fortunately I test-installed this before putting it under the Christmas tree and discovered it's now truly non-functioning.I remain unclear as to why manufacturers don't do simple OS updates for popular titles, particularly when attached to such classic figures as Dr. Seuss, but it is caveat emptor for kid software. I think I've had about 50% of the titles we've bought over the years actually work."
1,Horrible edition,"The description says ""remastered edition."" It also says that it is in widescreen. Wrong! It is formatted. And it is not remastered. It is so blown out, pixelated, and dark that I turned it off. This is a horrible, cheap bootleg copy from a generic company. The sleeve is flat color printing on thin paper and the disc is a dvdr. $15? I'm not very happy right now, as I love this film, and I will he returning this asap."
3,James Earl Jones in ......Blood Tide (1982).,"the movie takes place in modern times (which is to say when it was filmed in 1982). An American and his wife travel to Greece so that he can be re-united with his estranged siter whom he hasn't seen in years. He fears that she in emeshed in some religious cult, or worse.As the American digs deeper, he learns some information about virgin sacrifies that took place on the island in the past, according to local legend.I don't wish to give the plot away, but the rest of the film unfolds in how the American finds out the truth about his sister as he digs deeper into the mysterious activities of the locals on the Greek isle.James Earl Jones' character is something of a alcoholic treasure hunter, fortune seeker.this action mystery movie is effective, despite the low budget."
5,Good Movie for its Time,"Visitors curiosity while on a Greek island unleashes an ancient creature upon unsuspecting island goers. This very low-budget film suffers from poor lighting but has a solid cast (James Earl Jones, Jose Ferrer, Martin Kove and Oscar-winner Lila Kedrova) with good acting and an intriguing enough premise that it draws you in."
4,Very Cool,This book has tons of new options for any one wanting to give a new flavor to their d20 game. Magic is rare but you wont be short on options with all the new game features.The only down side is it has only a few color pictures.
5,An Absolute Must Buy,NOTE: The name for this product was changed from Iron Lore to Iron Heroes.Iron Heroes is an absolute must buy. This is the best D20 book published to date. I cannot say enough about it. The game mechanics and the overall flavor are almost perfecct. Kudos to Mike Mearls.
5,Retro-cool 110 film in a digital world.,"Even in this digital age, I still love using my Pentax Auto 110 SLR, and Kodak's 110 is a wonderful film. So much better than 110 used to be back in the 70's. The grain is miniscule, the colors are bright, true and beautifully saturated. The photos look like 35mm pics. It's hard to believe you can get these kinds of results from tiny 16mm 110 film, but you can with a great film and a decent camera. Break out that old Pocket Instamatic again and starting shooting while Kodak still makes this film. Hey, it's retro-cool!"
3,Just a Lightening McQueen...,"My son had to have this toy. We searched all over town to no avail and I finally broke down and paid a ridiculous price for it. Anyway, it's just a regular Lightening McQueen car with ""bugs"" stamped into the white of his teeth. (I could have done this with some small tools, black paint and a tiny paintbrush.) But my four-year-old is fascinated with this car so he gives it five stars -- it's definetely a favorite for kids."
4,JUGUETE,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT! FACINO ME, I HOPE TO MAKE PURCHASES IN THE SAME FUTURE SHOP, RECOMMEND OTHERS TO BUY THIS TYPE OF TOYS IN THIS STORE, YOU WORTH"
2,Not what they used to be.,"I was a fan of these, but they're not what they used to be. They're made by Frankford instead of Jelly Belly, and they're artificially flavored and waxy. The Gravy, Onion, and Pizza are authentic enough, but none of them are very tasty: not even the Blueberry or Pear. Recommended if you like artificially flavored and waxy jelly beans."
3,Best Jelly Beans Ever! Worst Price Ever!,"These beans are very impressive and some of them pack quite a punch! I was surprised at how well they captured the flavors. Nearly everything tastes exactly like what it's supposed to! Personally, I'm a fan of the vomit flavored bean(call me crazy!), but they also have more pleasant flavors such as popcorn and bacon. Soap was also very impressive. Grass doesn't really taste like grass(I was a kid so I know!!!). This is a great product for parties, throw em in a bowl and watch the funny faces haha! The best way to go about eating these is to take the flavor guide and throw it in the trash. The point of these beans is to surprise you, that was there purpose in the movies and books. I give this item 3 stars simply because of the outrageous price, you can just as easily go to a candy shop and buy a box for under $2. Overall, this is a very fun product and I highly reccomend it to any Harry Potter fan"
3,Flavors are not the same as the originals,"The flavors have since been changed. Unfortunately, Bertie Bott's does NOT include the soap, dirt, earwax, sardine, and vomit flavors anymore. BB has toned down the flavors (which I think takes away from the appeal of these jelly beans). The current flavors are: Watermelon, Pear, Ketchup, Blueberry, Cheese, Pizza, Banana, Marshmallow, Sausage, Onion, Wild Cherry, Mashed Potatoes, Cinnamon, Gravy, Fish, Cranberry & Apple, Peach, Pink Grapefruit, Pepper, and Lemon.I saw these at the local mall candy shop and they only had the new assortment of flavors as well. I decided to try purchasing these online (and pay the premium asking price) since I really wanted the old flavors and because some of the more recent reviews indicated that this seller had the original flavors. Of course, I should have e-mailed the seller first to confirm, but I don't really mind that much... It's still a fun gag gift, but not as crazy as the originals."
3,Expensive Beans,"Very good product, but very expensive for the actual amount that you get. Shipping cost was outrageous."
3,"Wow, yuck!","Wow, I didn't think they'd actually have those flavors. I thought it was a joke. Then... ewww! But, I got mine on clearance at a local store for $1.25 (and now I know why they were cheap). I tossed the candy inside and filled it up with regular Jelly Belly beans, which I love. It'll be perfect to stash in my purse to eat at the premiere of the next film."
2,ticked,the shipping was as expensive as the product. not happy about this at all. annoyed! will not purchase from them ever again!!!!!
1,What a rip-off!,"I bought these for my nephews for Christmas thinking that they would enjoy them. They started eating them and both said ""These are gross!"" Not only are they gross, but they are horribly over-priced."
4,GREAT RELAXING MUSIC!!!!,"The first time i heard this group was a week ago in a restaurant in Puerto Vallarta. The moment i came into the restaurant i asked the waiter what was being played there. He told me it was Willie & Lobo and the album ""Caliente"". The moment i came home i bought it and loved it!!! It has great rythms with a beautiful combination of guitar, violin and percussions.If you want to relax and transport yourself into a different place this CD is the one...great for your car, office, home, etc."
2,"""Frio"" is more like it","Dull, Spanish-inflected elevator music. I bought it mainly on the strength of the title, but ""Hot"" is hardly the adjective I'd use to describe this snoozer."
3,Everybody had a screamin' ball.,"Here we have a compilation CD of doo wop Halloween songs. Some of the songs are old, some of them are new, although in some cases it's hard to tell which is which. There are some good songs here and some mediocre songs, too. 27 doo wop Halloween songs is a bit much."
3,hart hat,"the color that do you send me is not the same ,,,,,,like the picture please review that and explain what you send those wrong"
3,So so,"Ok product, hat was really light tan unlike the dark tan one's around that are also labeled natural tan. Hat had descrepincies, had flat ground off spot on rear of hat. Other than that it was all in order. Gave three stars because it was actual carbon fiber."
1,missing ratchet suspension,"I ordered several of these hard hats but one of them did not have the ratcket suspension included, I am very disappointed."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I bought two of these hardhats ... one for myself, and one for my boyfriend. We're both union construction workers, just different trades. When I ordered them, I wondered why they were so much cheaper than the very same ones other vendors were selling. When I received them, I found out why. They were dusty, one had a small crack in the rim, and both were expired. (Yes, hardhats DO expire. Look at that barely visible calendar on the inside of your hardhat.) My bf and I still ended up keeping them and using them ... it wasn't worth the hassle of sending them back. I've wacked my head a few times with this hardhat on. I've been accidentally hit with falling nuts and washers. My hardhat hasn't shattered, so it's doing what it was meant to do. I'd buy the MSA Skullguard again, it is the gold standard as far as hardhats go, I just would not buy from the same vendor. (And I'd ask for the expiration date BEFORE making the order.)"
2,Not thrilled.,"Only hard hat I would consider wearing, I think I'd rather purchase in person due to the inconsistency in the hats these days!"
3,Store bought one's don't fit,"I was very disapointed, the store spice bottles (jars) are too big to fit into shelf. Need to be 2 inches taller and half an inch wider (out) shelf, etc. It is a great shelf, thou. I might be forced to buy new empty jars and labels that fit, now."
2,Cute but small,"The spice rack is nice looking (except for a small chip on the side) and was easy to hang, but unfortunately the space between the shelves is quite small and I can only fit small to medium bottles in it. I still have no place to put larger bottles of spices!"
5,Wonderful for our Kitchen,"We received this item really quickly and set it up as soon as we put spices in the spice jars. We bought these spices jars to put into this rack:J.K. Adams BCS-16 16 1-1/2-Ounce Spice Bottles, Caps, Sifters Set.My wife really is happy with it and people have complimented us. It holds 6 of the jars we bought per row, so a total of 24 spices. We mounted it on our wall for easy access (it comes with holes drilled in and screws).If you're look for a spice rack this one is great. One thing to note is that the wood on here is sealed, so if you're thinking it is unfinished and want to stain it, you won't be able to. The wood is nice though, solid and strong. It also is a tiny bit darker (tanner) than the pictures."
4,Very nice!,"Very nice spice rack...well made and a nice color.Since I was expecting to live in my Class C motorhome for some time, and I like to use a lot of herbs and spices when I cook, I bought this spice rack to attach to the wall by the range/oven. Fits the space perfectly and holds 24 of my favorites. I have standard size jars from different spice companies and have no trouble getting them to fit, but larger ones won't. The bottles go in and come out easily. The only problem I had was that the bottles flew out when I went over a speed hump or a rough railroad track too fast. That was easily fixed by cutting pieces of thin cardbord and inserting them in the racks while I was on the move. No more flying jars."
4,Very nicely built,"Very nice spice rack, unfortunately I have too many spices to fit them all on it. Still, I am happy with the purchase - I just keep the spices I use most on the rack."
1,This is a Fake book.,"Readers,Please be aware that this is not the original book by Mr.Paul Palady. I am his student and have followed his original book. The original book is well illustrated and the examples are very helpful for using the quality tools in a day to day job.Thanks."

4,Cokin lens cap,The one I received does not look anything like the photo. In fact I wasn't sure I ordered it. It does serve its purpose to protect the lens with the P holder mounted.
3,This has to be the most worst purchase I've ever made,"I have absolutely no idea why I bought this -- it doesn't serve any real purpose. It's a solution searching for a problem. It was bundled (but priced separately) with the Cokin graduated ND filters.I can't see why anyone would ever use this cap. After all, dust is going to come in from the slots. And you're not exactly protecting a $1,000+ lens.The price dropped 50% right after I bought this useless, unused piece of plastic. Shame on me for buying for the sake of buying."
1,fragile,I USE IT COVER BREADS AT FARMERS MKT. AND THE BREAK FREQUENTLY VERY LIGHT AND THEY BLOW OFF THE TABLE
5,The Saga's Turning Point,"This DVD Collection is where everything changes. During these episodes, you get to really know the main characters and all of the plot lines are twisted. The episodes on these DVDs really brings new hope to the humans aboard the SDF-1. I don't wanna ruin it, so i suggest you go out and buy it."
4,Pretty good first book,"This was my very first bonsai book. It helped inspire me into the hobby, and the book is great for a beginner, but I thought it was just a bit short. Says 128 pages, but feels more like 50. Overall its okay."
2,Too HOT,I ended up returning this product because the flap material is too long and too stiff. It always seems to end up bunching up and poking you. After awhile it just gets to be an annoyance. Plus the hat and flap combo tend to really hold heat in near you head and neck making you even more uncomfortable.
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"The reason I bought this is because I keep getting sunburned on the back of my neck, and this item takes care of that problem. It's big and comfortable; my headphones fit under it. The only slight problem is it tends to ride up at the back, leaving some skin exposed until you fix it again. Perhaps a little added weight at the bottom would solve this problem."
1,"Good idea, but too hot","I purchased this cap for my husband who wanted an alternative to putting sunscreen on his neck when he mowed the lawn wearing his baseball cap. We live in Louisiana, so it can get pretty humid outside. He said he hated this cap. The heat from his head and neck had nowhere to escape, it stayed right under the cap and neck cape. He's back to wearing his ball cap and sunscreen."
5,Works for me.,I live in Hawaii and this hat works great. Even on the tractor with a small roof I need sun protection. Mowing the pastures is much less of a chore while wearing this hat. I did soak the flap in water and fabric softener overnight to make it softer.
5,Love it!!,My little girls love this little bag. It help teach them how to pack their own bags....great item would buy again!!
2,Pity it doesn't run on any modern OS,"Just don't make the same mistake I did - only 2 of these Arthur games actually support NT/2000/XP. So unless you have the archaic 95/98 OS, fuhgedaboutit. Pity, because our son loves to play these at our local library."
1,if you have windows xp - don't waste your money,"my daughter is interested in the game, but as we have windows xp, she cannot play the game. i have contacted the learning company and have tried to install it using the windows program compatibility wizard and the 16-bit version. nothing works. the learning company's reply is that it will not work on windows xp - end of story. and i'm out of luck!"
3,Correction - doesn't run on XP still...,It turns out I was wrong.... the 32 bit version definitely doesn't work on XP and the 16 bit version starts but faults in several places on XP even with the compatibility settings to run like 9x .... if you want to use this software seems 95/98/ME & NT4 seem to be the limit for now. Sorry !
1,Piece of Junk!,"My son was dying to play this game. I can't install it on ANY of my operating systems and I have them all! I keep getting an error. What's worse is it installed it's Brodcast dssagent on my computers and it won't let me delete the file or folder. Every time I log off, I get an error that the program isn't responding.Saying that it is Windows compatible is very misleading. What a waste of time. Don't get this CD!"
3,Righteous Indignation,"Paul Hellyer loves Canada and he is seeing George Bush and Paul Martin intent on destroying it.He proves his points by quoting those who would destroy Canada.Bush, it turns out, is far worse than your worst nightmares. He must be stopped.Hellyer methodically makes his case, building to a crescendo of righteous indignation."
2,"No text to speech, out of date maps and bad routing.","The GPS352 does not support text to speech. It will not call out the street names of the turns or exits. It only calls out the distance and the direction of the turn.The maps are out of date. Roads that have been in my subdivision for 3 years are not on the map. As well as well known grocery stores. I would not trust this unit in unfamiliar areas. Of course that is the only reason to buy a gps unit...The routing determined by the unit is very poor. It directs me to take local 2 lane roads the cross several railroad tracks (which are always busy) instead of the main 4 lane road which leads straight to the main highway. The unit ignores the fastest route and prefer highway selections.The unit also replaces saved routes which are painstakingly created to avoid certain roads with the original calculated routes.The windshield mount allows the unit to vibrate and shake making it difficult to read. When not shaking, the display is good."
3,Do I need to know where I am going?,"The item itself is very nice and helpful tool, however for a young person of 75 years, it is more than I need. I liked the product, but not who I purchased it from, as they would not allow me to return it because I found that it was too complicated for me when I opened the packaging."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS GPS UNIT,"Uniden sold these GPS unit with the thought of making map updates available. They have never made an update available. As a matter of fact , I still have the original 2006 MapTraxx NA database. I feel very disrespected by Uniden's position with this unit.I rated it a 2 only because it's a fast and friendly GPS unit. Uniden support is a ZERO."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"I have used all the different brands of GPS and they all have their faults but this one was not even in the race. Confusing, user unfriendly and couldn't find our location most of the time. The instruction book gave the impression that it was badly translated from another language. I must say bought this from a store, not from Amazon, and the abysmal service from the store did not help, but that is still Uniden's problem as they should be more careful who they let sell their product. I would not recommend any Uniden product. it's the Yugo of electronics."
2,"No reset button, same case as many other units","This GPS is the same case as the Delphi GPS 200. My delphi completely quit after 1 month. If you look at other GPS models, you will see that many use this inferior case, NO RESET button? Excellent satt reception though, but longevity questioned, especially if it bugs out"
5,Surprisingly good.,"I was given this album by a friend, and I didn't know what to think because I had never heard of Marshall Artist before. When I put it into my CD player I was in for a surprise. Each song is catchy -- good music to get into on a summer day ... yet with a deeper message if you listen closely, too. And, unlike a lot of CD's these days, it doesn't wear out its welcome after a couple of plays. All around, I'd say a great pop album by a band that (I'm betting) will be really popular in a couple years."
4,Everyone has a birthday...,"Bear and his friends at the Big Blue House really know how toparty! They love to give SURPRISE parties, and teach about keepingsecrets and making a plan. Tree-lo feels bad about wishing it was his birthday instead of Tutter's, and Bear explains why getting to be one year older is important. My only gripe is a minor one... Bear tells his friends he just wants to do 'nothing' on his birthday. But they surprise him with a party anyway. I'd like my son to respect what others express to him. But you gotta love the Big Blue House Birthday Song... ""Happy Happy Happy Happy Birthday Birthday!..."" We still can't stop singing it!"
2,Disappointing,"This is an old-time favorite that I haven't been able to find since moving to WY.It's disappointing to have gotten ""irregulars""--stale, brittle nugget; faded (and spotty) dull chocolate coating, and semi-filled wrappers.This candy bar should be pull-apart chewy and the dark chocolate coating should be justthat--dark and glossy. I'll order directly from maker next time; I'm not about to trust this company again."
4,Nice lunch box-My son loves it!,"I bought this lunch box for my son to carry to school. He loves Thomas and is really happy with the lunch box. The bottle that is included with the lunch box is not practical for anything. The lid won't stay on straight and it leaks. But, since I didn't buy it for the bottle, it really doesn't matter."
4,Klaus Malling Olsen is the King!,"Tha author is one of Europes best and most experienced field ornithologists, and especially gulls, terns, skuas and jaegers is his domaine. Nice pictures, tremendous text - God buy it!"
2,Six remixes for cash,"2 1/2Mildly maintaining, mostly mediocre un-Ventolin like display which goes way beneath standard levels of quality for James but does retain enough signature kick to warrant just the slightest of ganders."
4,Sweet,The book has wonderful pictures. The story has captured a whimsical view of a wolves family life.
2,Old and outdated!,"This book may help historians, but offers virtually no help to the aquarist in 2013. All the information and products are very outdated!"
1,worst programming book I've ever worked through,"Well, suffice it to say that the guy who gave this book 5 stars was a grad student in Virginia Tech where the author of the book is now the Head of the CS department.I just don't know how to even classify the book It almost sounds like an attempt to popularize some semi-working GUI library which sounds like somebody's pet research project. A good 80% of the book talks about it. All the rest are banal truths about what OOP is. Half of the code in the book doesn't work either, with older or newer or any other version of the GUI library which is presented there. I still wonder what the point of the book was. To add another publicaton to the authors list?"
1,"Poorly constructed, trigger broke after 2nd use!",This item is not covered under Rubbermaid's warranty. It is manufactured by a 3rd party using the Rubbermaid brand name. I called Rubbermaid after the trigger broke after it's second use and they gave me a 1.800 number for the 3rd party that did not work! I'm looking at other nozzles now and looking for one that is not made entirely of plastic!
4,Very good for everything but watering delicate plants.,Four of the five nozzles are powerful to very powerful. One nozzle almost rivals an electric power sprayer. The shower nozzle is good for watering plants that are NOT delicate. Bushes and normal plants should be just fine with the shower nozzle. I wish that there were more nozzle settings though.
2,"Spray nozzle works, but the hose connection leaks","The nozzle works just like your average everyday spray nozzle, but the hose connection part leaks. My other nozzle works just fine, so it must be the new nozzle. Bought it because it's cheap, now I know it's just a waste of money no matter how cheap it is."
4,Great Deal for the Price!,"I've been through a LOT of hose nozzles this summer and so far, this one keeps working. It's lighweight and comfortable in hand. Only thing it's missing is a ""mist"" setting. You get your money's worth though!"
3,"Good, solid, but",it has only 5 pattern and all of them are strong or very strong.Good for a washing your car but not watering delicate plants.The weakest of them is a shower pattern so go figure.
2,Not very sturdy,"This one fell apart after 3 uses. It can not be that I used to much pressure, my hand is weak and damaged, so I htink it was the design. Everyone else seems happy with theirs, so maybe I got a lemon."
5,Gotta have my (Henckels) garlic (press).,"This a wonderful manual tool to have in your kitchen. This garlic press is solidly made, well-balanced, and feels good in the hand due to a clean, functional design. It is true that some garlic pieces will ooze out the sides, but this usually happens if the grid compartment is overloaded. I so enjoy this tool because the removable grid slips out fast and is easy to wash. Immediately after using I give it a rinse under running water to remove the small garlic particles. This is a tool I have come to depend on almost daily. Last week in the rush to evacuate from hurricane Isabel I forgot to pack this favorite kitchen tool and now I am about to order another one to use in my out-of-state sanctuary."
2,Bride and the Beast Is Not,"I was disappointed with Teresa Medeiros' latest, The Bride and the Beast, it was not one of her best. The characters nor the story line were not fully developed. The ""magic"" that is usually in Medeiros' books just wasn't in this one. I hope the next one has more substance, as Medeiros is usually one of my favorite authors."
2,For Teenagers,"After reading the first 100 pages of this book, I came to the conclusion this book was written for teenagers,and young teenagers at that, and am mystified by all of the 4 and 5 star reviews."
1,silly silly silly (and not in a good way),"First, a disclaimer. I am not a reader of romance novels, and so judge this novel as a story on it's own merit. That being said, I found this drivel almost totally unreadable. The *twists* (which I will not spoil for people who have yet to read it) were obvious from page one, and the characters, dialog, and ""plot"" were all haykeyed."
1,A huge disappointement,"Teresa Medeiros used to be a good writer. Shadows and Lace is one of my all-time favorites and although, in my opinion, she has never equaled that book, her subsequent efforts were good enough to remain on my keeper shelf. But lately. . .I don't know what to say. I'm sure I'm in the minority here, but Charming the Prince was awful. And so is this book. A silly plot, contrived partings, heavy-handed attempts at humor, the stereotypical sisters, I could go on and on, but I won't. Suffice it to say, I was terribly disappointed. Ms. Medeiros has shown such talent in the past, I can only hope she will show it again. Until she does, this is the last book of hers I will ever buy."
2,A Disappointed Fan,"The atmosphere of the story was so dark and dreary. The plot was depressing. Gwen & Bernard could have been exciting figures but they seem boged down in the history of the village. Bernard as a shadow lover was well done. If Gwen had some vitality and was a caring thoughful person she would have insisted they leave the hateful, cowardly people of the village and move on to a brighter future. Not a keeper!"
3,Wait for the paperback!,"THE BRIDE AND THE BEAST is Medeiros' version of ""Beauty and the Beast"" meets ""Cinderella"". There are a few good points--the bride is a larger-sized woman with a good heart and a strong personality, and she's intelligent to boot. Unfortunately, the book lacked that certain something that either makes or breaks a book for me. I also felt the bride's motivation for allowing herself to be ""sacrificed"" to the beast (which we discover at the end of the book) was totally out of character.Not one of the author's best works. Wait for the paperback, as it's not worth the hardback price."
4,A nice Versian for an Old Classis!,"Yup, Beauty and the Beast. A great love story but an ok remake. Although we all know what was going to happen but Teresa just added a smidgen of susspense. Although there as no Mrs. Pots and a senile yet intelligent father, there is still the 'Beast's best friend named Tupper and a traitor/senile father for Gwendolyn (Beauty). Althoug there were a lot of similarities, it was still an ok read."
3,It was okay.,"I would not read this book more than once. I cannot compare thisbook to the other three books I've read by her(Charming the Prince, Whisper of Roses, One Night of Scandle.).I must say, the only reason I bought this book because I liked its' prologue. The rest of the story seemed silly to me."
4,Keeping with author's style...,"This latest offering from Ms. Medeiros proves that humor can make or break the novel. As is typical with Medeiros' novels, this one has a snappy plot, fast-paced dialogue, and is chock full of the author's trademark humor. It is not, however, her best character study, as the hero is not as strongly developed as he could have been. Overall, this is a very good read; but, unless you are a Medeiros die-hard, do wait for the paperback."
2,Dragon in the 1700's?,"I am not going into the plot as many reviewers had already done so. Even though the book is nicely written, I had a hard time believing that the setting was in the 1700's. With the belief in dragons and mythical beasts, I thought the setting was in medieval times. I just can't believe that anyone in the 1700's, even in a remote highland village would still believe in dragons.The 2 stars are for the unbelievable setting."
2,Not her best,"I love Medeiros' other novels, however this one just didn't cut it for me. I just couldn't understand how the herione could fall in love with ""the dragon"" so soon, they didn't talk to each other hardley at all, it was just like, this is a romance novel and so these characters are going to fall in love and then guess what? They are now in love, even though I wasn't sure how they got there so quickly. The whole book moved like that, you are just supposed to take it for granted that they ""love"" each other, when you're not even sure how this could be. I didn't feel anything for the characters, I didn't relate to them at all and couldn't make myself care about what happend to them. Read Medeiros' other novels, but skip this one."
4,"Wit, wisdom, and spellbinding love","On a dark and stormy night in 1761, the superstitious Highlanders of Ballybliss receive yet another demand from the Dragon that prowls the shadows of Castle Weyrcraig. To break an old curse laid upon them 15 years ago and to satisfy the demands of the Dragon, the villagers decide on a sacrificial offering that comes in the form of Gwendolyn Wilder, the village virgin. She is bound, staked, and left in the courtyard of the ancient fortress of Weyrcraig to die at the hands of the Dragon. Gwendolyn, however, does not believe in dragons, and the Dragon does not have much of an appetite for virgins. Or do they?THE BRIDE AND THE BEAST is a sensual romance that centers on revenge and betrayal. This tale is a satisfying page turner, with enchanting lead characters and an emotional storyline. Though it ends somewhat dispassionately, this Teresa Medeiros book is a pleasure to read.Kerry Atkins"
2,"3 stars for first half, 2 for the second","I loved the hero. I love dark, tortured heroes in general, so he attracted my attention at once. The heroine, on the other hand, was something completely different. She was stubborn and childish. It is all right that she isn't a typical beauty, but it really isn't necessary that she is referred to as being fat. As for the story, I liked the whole dragon idea. It was fresh, and had me interested in a minute. But, unfortunately, only for a minute. I don't know what the heroes saw in each other. They didn't even know each other. There was only passion. And from the moment when Bernards identity was revealed, things went downhill."
2,WHEEEERES THE BEAST??,"Hero--tortured, yes. Beast, No--and for that, I was very disappointed. I guess ""beast"" was what the townspeople thought of this unknown, unseen ""dragon"". The heroine was quite spunky--that I liked; however, I never quite understood why she was the only one who could read or who had any semblance of intelligence in that town. This story was not what I would call a beauty and the beast type tale, although the reader is lead to think it is throughout most of the book. Shame, shame!!! Romantic interludes between the heroine and the hero happen very near the end of the book, and you MUST use your own imagination--nothing explicit here. What should have been a dramatic coupling for them was a real let down for me. For those who like this type of tepid, sweet, kisses type of romance, this will probably be a good book. For those who like their romances on the steamy side, forget this book. For those who want a true beauty and the beast story, skip this book. For me? Not my cup of tea."
3,"3.5, OK For a ""Dragon"" Story","This is another one of the odd stories. This book focuses on a ""dragon"". I didn't really like it very much. Seemed a little too stange. I didn't like the characters."
5,The bride and the beast,"I absolutely loved it!!! Another great read from Teresa Medeiros. I found I could not put it down. I was sad to have it end. It was a refreshingly new concept and kept up the pace from beginning to end. I loved all the characters and they were all well developed. I loved that it had a mysterious air to it as well as a beautiful love story. I could really relate to Gwendolyn and her sisters,as well as the other characters in this book. It was sexy without being raunchy."
4,Fairy Tales Come True,"I really enjoyed this book, and this short series (Fairy Tales). I wish Medeiros wrote more along this line. This was one of her first books, but well written."
5,a creative historical romance,I really enjoyed this book. The female lead is strong and enduring and the plot is unique for a historical romance. Highly recommended. The story will suck you in.
4,Sweet,"Love Medeiros!My favorite quote from the story:""How could I have let you do any of those things when I've never even seen your face? When I don't even know your name?""""That may be true,"" he said quietly, ""but for just a moment there, I would have sworn you knew my heart."""
3,Overall decent/good.,Good story line on the power forgiveness but a little unrealistic for me. Stephen Baldwin is the reason I rented this. His part was a little slow and kind of bland.
1,Not sure,"We were just not sure about this movie? In fact we did not even finish it, so I can't comment on the whole movie. But of the portion we saw it was odd to say the least. I think I would choose a different movie to spend time watching!"
4,Could you forgive?,"What happens when your life is turned upside down by the thoughtless actions of another?In this film we follow the main character who is raped, and then gives birth to a boy.We follow as she copes, deals with and learns what it means to truly show forgiveness..The story is very good, the filming is excellent... the acting does leave a bit to be desired from a couple of the characters.Baldwin's character itself seemed forced and fake.Yet the key two characters did a great job at leading you through their emotions.This is a great film. You will be challenged about how you react when someone hurts you and we don't forgive..."
4,Loving the Bad Man,"It was a little akward in parts, but overall the movie was a very positive experience. Reminds us that forgiving someone isn't just for the person who has done wrong, but very important to ourselves. Very good movie!"
3,Great movie but....,"The movie was great. I enjoyed the courage and faith of the main character. The acting was good. The only downside to this movie was the cinematography was not good. It looked like someone taped the movie with a home video camera. I got a headache trying to watch the movie, I would not have completed watching, but I really enjoyed the story and wanted to see what the outcome was. I would recommend this movie, but be aware of the quality of the film."
3,Loving the Bad man,"The movie, Loving the Bad Man was not what i built it up to be, from commercials of it, and the actor who was the main star, isnt who i thought it was, as they show on the cover."
