5,My Kids Love This DVD,"I bought my two children, 5 and 2 years old, this dvd because they love Jack's Big Music Show on Noggin. It has become their favorite and they play it constantly. Lucky for me it also comes with and audio cd that we have playing in the car."
5,Great DVD,My daughter is 17-months old and loves this DVD; she watches it at least twice a day. She loves all of the songs. And the best part is that I can tolerate the music also! The songs are silly enough to keep kids attention but not so annoying that I can't listen to it.I would recommend this DVD to any one looking for a great music DVD!
5,THANK YOU LAURIE!!!,"About all I can say is this...when my first son was young, he watched a Raffi video over and over and over...it felt like nails on a chalkboard. Thankfully my younger son who is now three has laurie Berkner to listen to with songs that are far more catchy and fun for children to listen to. All of her favorites are on the DVD including We are the Dinosaurs, Victor Vito, and Pig on her Head. My son just loves marching to We are the Dinosaurs. Her band are all solid musicians who seem to really love what they do. I'm glad my son knows how to work the DVD player himself because it's one he's going to be watching a lot. Great DVD and great value too!"
5,The best,My daughter is 20 months old and is not really interested in watching t.v except when it is Laurie Berkner. She loves to dance and has learned so many new words from singing along with the songs. It is nice music to listen that does not drive the adults crazy.
3,its just ok,I have the original one with most of these songs and my kids like it much better -- seems like the best songs are in the bonus
3,Prefer the CDs,For some reason my daughter prefers the CDs to the DVD. I think there isn't much to keep her attention. Can't explain why but that seems to be how she feels about it.
5,Excellent screw extractor set,"This is a superb screw extractor set. I bought it today to remove a 6mm screw shaft that I accidentally sheared off in a toy I was putting together for my son. I was in a hurry so I paid $52 for it at the hardware store... the Amazon prices are much better.At any rate, these are great, you don't need a tap wrench or a separate drill bit; just put one of the heads in your power drill like you would any other drill bit and it'll bore a hole down through the screw and then extract it in short order. The one thing the (well written and comprehensive) directions said to do in addition to making sure the bit is centered is to stop regularly to remove the metal shavings that come out of the screw as you're boring through it (which I did and it worked great)."
2,"I really wanted to love this set, but....",I purchased this set because I needed a bold extractor set. Problem is that I've tried to use it now on a half-dozen occasions - all were unsuccessful. All it did was make the worn out screws involved having a bigger gapping hole. This set has not worked for me at all - but you don't know until you try it.
2,Boring! Don't waste your money.,"I bought this video because I'm working with my son to try to get him to start saying some words. This video got great review, thus being the reason for my purchase of this specific product. It was so boring that it put my son to sleep! We watched it after he had gotten up from his nap, actually. It's no better than Baby Einstein - which is a great concept for the little ones - but not good for toddlers. My son can communicate very well receptively, which might be the reason for him not having any interest in this video. We bought a Baby Babble video which seemed to engage him much better."
3,it's okay...,I think these are probably a little better made then the baby einstein videos however my active 2 year old wouldn't watch more than 5 minutes of this at a time. It just couldn't hold his attention.We also just bought The Leap Frog Letters DVD and he is actually really enjoying that one.
5,Brainy baby english,"I am such a fan of the brainy baby dvds and own six different types. My two year old loves them and will watch them over and over again and knows how to place them in the dvd player himself. By just watching and participating with these discs he has learned all his ABCs, letter sounds, shapes and colors along with how to count to 100 which is great for his age. I would recommend these dvd over baby einstein because they go into more depth and are more enjoyable and educational."
1,Not animated enough to keep baby's attention.,"I like the Brainy Baby line, but this video, although has great information, did not keep my one year old interested at all. At least with the My Baby Can Read and Sesame Street series she gets a little animation and songs while she is looking at the words."
3,Smaller than it looks,"The 8"" drop makes for very comfortable shoulder carrying, however the bag is too small and narrow to be fully practical. Cannot fit more than a tiny cell and thin wallet. I wish they made this full-hobo size, but couldn't resist buying it despite the stated proportions because it IS really cute."
1,Alpha is a POS.!,".....Ya, Ya..Some guy Steve bought Alpha and promised better releases..""DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT""..My copy has bottom horizontal roll through out the whole 92 minutes..worst print ever..If it say's Alpha Video..RUN..NOW.! Ripoff City.!"
3,he forgot to mention something :(,"It's a very good movie, but what irritated me during its vewing was that the director had ""forgoten"" to mention in the credits that he'd made an adaptation from a book by one of the greatest Soviet SF-writers - Alexander Belyaiev. The book's title is ""The head of professor Dawell"". It was first published in 1925 as a short story and lated was rewritten in a novel.The adaptation is a very close one, even such details as the birthmark on the girl's shoulder were taken from the book. Maybe the motives of characters are somewhat changed, but that doesn't excuse the director, who, being of Russian origin, obviously had read the book."
4,"Has this version of ""Monolith"" been remastered?","Has this version of ""Monolith"" released been remastered? Please help. I can't find out if this version has been remastered or not. It says it was reissued in early 2008, but no mention of remastering or expanded artwork.Thanks."
2,First Sub Par Effort!,"With the exception of track one and the rocker ""Stay Out of Trouble"", this recording falls far short of the production and songwriting quality of previous efforts (Especially Leftoverature and POKR).A lot of pointless riffs and bombastic noodlings make this a hard listen, except for the most dedicated ""can hear no wrong"" fan of fans."
4,"Great album, but not a remaster!","This is a great album from the latter days of Kansas' stardom, but don't be fooled by the 2008 release date. This is the same CD that's been available since the late 80's. It's just a lower priced re-issue."
3,Strike 1,"This album was not the end. It was not the end of the beginning. It was most definitely the beginning of the end. There's nothing very extraordinary here, and this is the first Kansas album that consists entirely of short pop songs without a single long masterwork, in the Journey From Mariabronn / Song For America / The Pinnacle / Magnum Opus / Closet Chronicles tradition. One reviewer here said that people who dislike this album are of the Dust in the Wind/Carry On crowd, but the opposite is true: it is the hard-core fan who appreciates the too-big-to-play-on-the-radio masterpieces who will be most disappointed with this effort. I certainly was."
5,"Love it, works perfectly","I bought this to solve a problem I was having. We have just one SmartCard for our digital camera, and it's always nearly full. Most of our pictures get stored on the family PC, but we use those 1-hour kiosks at stores to get prints made.I had been burning CDs, but that's time-consuming and uses up CDs. Plus, nobody else in the house knows how to do it so it was always my chore.Now that we have the Dazzle, I'm done burning CDs. When we want to make a few prints we just flip through the pictures on the computer and drag the ones we want over to the Dazzle folder. They get stored on the SmartCard, and from there it's a snap to get the prints made.For this price, I can't imagine why every digital camera owner doesn't already have one of these!"
2,shallow,"it an OK story. it has a conventional plot, not too hard to predict. If you're looking for big Meanings or great literature, this is not the book. ""If he hollers , let him go"" is a much more telling story than this."
2,Confusing sort of ramble....,"I'm not a mason, but over the last several months I have had the opportunity to read several books on Freemasonry. C. Bruce Hunter's is *not* one of the better ones. It seems to be a disjointed book making questionble connections in history and passing over some key points. It's not a pro/anti- mason book - but for those looking for a good book on the history and background of freemasonry - you'd be better served by reading something like Robinson's Born in Blood....."
4,Vas Deferens Organization - 'Drug Bubbles' (Tekito),"This Vas Deferens CD has three tracks, each run between eight to fifteen minutes a piece - plus they all have at least five different 'segments'. Even though this VDO title is basically a mini-album, I do think I might actually like this CD more than any other disc I've ever heard of theirs. Third cut ""Candies And Confections"" is probably the best song here, hands down. Maybe weird psychedlic to some, but to fans who possess a true appetite for this genre will likely get as much out of this CD as I did."
5,"WOW! Fantastic product, fantastic sound","The only problem would be memory but it's so easy to download different music I don't mind. I love the fact that I can, in minutes, pick out my workout songs and have a player so small and so light that I forget that it's there. I am absolutely nuts about this product."
5,The Value leader & Boy was I impressed,"First the weight. It's awesome. It's so light I don't even know I am carrying it. Second the sound. It's awesome. The Cure never sounded so good. Third, it tapes voices. Yep, it's a tape recorder too. Nothing this cheap does all three. Yea the software isn't the most intuitive but it does a good job & is easy to figure out withinall of ten minutes. Yep, yep, yep. It's a great little thing. Whatever piddling things people complain about, remember, NO ONE can match this price WITH THESE FEATURES. Yep, yep, yep. Buy it."
2,Not impressive at all,"This product has a very buggy and awkward user interface.Downloading a song to the device should have been very easy.Unfortunately the interface is very confusing and it makesa simple thing very difficult to use.The player has no off-on switch, so you can not turned it off.But it exhausts the battery in less than 2 days if you leavebattery in without playing.The other problem is, I constantly run into ""battery low"" eventhough the battery is still at 80% of capacity. Sometimes, itdoes not work with certain brands of battery even brand new.You have to take it out and back in several times before it""may"" suddenly decide to accept it.I would recommend not to buy this. It simple gave me too muchfrustration."
2,Not worth the money,"The Good:Small, lightweight, inexpensivedecent soundThe Bad:The battery life on this thing is awful. In under two hours the thing is completey drained. This is made worse by the fact thateven when it's ""off"" it still has an active display, furtherdraining the single AAA batteryInterface is not intuitive (then again what do you expect for something this small)Headphones. Simply put, they stink. Those people with large ears may find them perfect though.Memory size is limited, and not upgradeable.Conclusion:The mini-yepp is an expensive, decent piece of equipment. Howeverit's not worth the money. Its performance does not meet the specifications that are outlined in the product description and Iwould advise anyone looking for an mp3 player to avoid this modelunless they have money to burn."
3,beware... the software sucks,"The device itself is a cool little gizmo, although the memory size is small and it burns through batteries pretty fast. Otherwise it's perfect. It's tiny, the sound is great, and it's one of the cheaper mp3 players on the market.But be warned, the software included with the player is absolutely horrible. ...Just absolutely horrible! It's very difficult to use, and it doesn't get any easier with experience. I had to install it twice to get it to work, and now it keeps locking up...."
4,Solid if not Spectacular Performer,"Got my Yepp Mini-Yepp several months ago to take to the gym 3 times a week. I've been very pleased with the performance in a very practical way - I take it, it plays, it doesn't ""skip"" and I don't have to listen to the (bad) music at the gym. The downsides are (of course) the batteries don't last too long and you only get about an hour's worth of music to load on (w/o upgrade). But i manage to get about 3 hours of operation (w/ rechargeable batteries - I recharge 2 batts once a week). I found initial loading of software not a problem, and changing mp3s is not a big deal. If you're an audiophile or extremely picky about things, don't get it. If you just want to go to the gym & ""tune out"". This will work fine."
2,disappointing in terms of memory and ease of use,"I bought this when Amazon mailed me an e-mail advertising it...I've recently gotten into mp3s and was impressed by my friend who bought one of those mac-friendly Ipod devices. So I bought this after reading some positive reviews. Basically, here' the skinny: 1) the memory is tiny. 12, 13 songs, tops. 2) the software is clumsy and hard to use; it takes some tinkering to figure out. 3) It does burn through the single aaa battery pretty quickly; I use rechargeables (and so should you), so it's not that big a deal. 4) It is very tiny and portable. 5) it's short on buttons...you have to use 4 buttons (play, left-right, and a function button) to navigate every command. this is irritating if you want to shift to shuffle mode in mid-jog.So, if you don't mind having only 12 songs or so, and are comfortable with the software interface, I'd say go for it. Myself, I wish I'd bought a cd/mp3 player, despite the larger size."
4,bought it to work in a loud place,My 1st MP3 gadget. I work on a large network and some of the closets/rooms are extremely loud so I bought a set of Sony MDR-NC5 Noise Canceling Headphones and the YP20S. The headphones significantly help (don't expect too much) and the YP20S fits unnoticed in my shirt pocket.It's loud enough for me.It eats batteries but is good enough for my 1-2 jobs in a closet.The poor controls are only surpassed by the poor manuals/software but you don't need to use the controls all that much.
4,"Very nice toy, however battery sucker",I realy like the small size of this player. It's a great toy. I bought the player without the usb cable. Ouch! The cable cost me [$$$]. I can barely listen twice the 12 songs I downloaded and I have to change the battery. Don't buy this if you don't have a charger. I wish there was a 128Mb player.
4,Great,"Had another mp3 that was confusing, so after reading reviews on Yepp-20s in Amazon sight, purchased and only have the complaint of using so many batteries and only 12-15 songs. The sound is certainly loud enough to hear while I mow the lawn and do excersise activies. Can hear it over stero system at the skating rink. It was so easy to load songs into computer and download into mp3. It's so light and handy. Have recommened it to anybody that will listen..."
3,Yes and no,"I love the gadget, but the software is incomprehensible. They tried to get cute with it, but ends up being all but unusable. And it locks up my system to the point where the only way to reboot is to literally unplug the CPU."
5,"Really small, good mp3",This mp3 is really small and handy. You can exercise with it pretty easily. The price is good.
4,"Great for a small, light mp3 player.","If you want a small mp3 player that's easy to take on the go, get this one.As always, there are some trade-offs in getting a player that's this small. The interface is not very easy to use - it's not very intuitive how to change the play settings and use the buttons to navigate through the menus. The equalizer is ok, but not that great. There are not a lot of extra features (e.g. progamming a playlist).This does not bother me, as I use mine at the gym and during my commute, and am not interested in having a lot of features. What I want is something that is small, that is light, and that I don't notice. For that, this is a good product.One other thing - the software you use to load the songs onto the player is atrocious. It gets the job done, of course, but you'll fine it's not easy to learn to use, and it's not too flexible."
4,Love this little player- new to MP3's,I travel a great deal and was looking for a tiny MP3 to take on trips and workout with. I have the 64MB model and have roughly 2 albums worth of music on it. I'm new to MP3 technology and found the software very easy and intuitive. After roughly an hour I had started copying my CD's to MP3. It does come with an armband and pouch and the only downside is that this little sucker is a battery eater (to be expected because of the size) and the earphones fall out of my ears easily. I'll likely have to get a new set if I run or ski with it. Love the price. I'm very satisfied.
2,"Not the ""Dybbuk"" DVD to get","I saw this film several years ago in NYC when it was first restored by the National Center for Jewish Film, and it was an incredible job. Their DVD is the one to get. I bought Bel Canto's VHS version, and it had the same captioning (rather, NON-captioning) problems that their DVD here apparently has.The movie is simply incredible and powerful. Highly recommended. But NCJF's version is best. Fully captioned, and contains all extant footage.www.jewishfilm.org"
1,"brilliant film, disastrous transfer to DVD. buyers beware","The Dybbuk is one of the great classics of the Jewish theater, and the landmark film, made in prewar Warsaw in 1937 is a haunting and beautifully rendered version. But don't buy this DVD. It's genuinely awful: no subtitles for the first 10 minutes; scratchy musical score, and poor images. Go the National Center for Jewish Film where you will find a restored version with new subtitles."
1,Great Film - BUT DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION...,"... unless you are fluent in Yiddish.The subtitles are horrible; they are from the original print. It is literally unwatchable (again, unless you're Yiddish is exceptionally strong, in which case - knock yourself out).If you don't speak Yiddish, spend the $36.00 for the NFJC version.And just to be clear, I do not work for the NFJC, I don't know anyone who does, and I have no vested interest in promoting their products.I do, however, have a vested interest in preventing other people from getting ripped off by the company that is distributing this version. Amazon should pull the title."
3,Slip Sliding Away,"I bought this pedal machine to help me exercise. My biggest complaint is that it will not stay put. One a wood floor it will slide far too easily. Even when put on a sticky mat, it would not stay in place. On carpeting it is not much better. So far the only options I have found to make it work are to put it on a sticky mat on carpeting (and even then it will push out slowly) or to put it up against a wall or furniture. Still, when I can get it to stay in place, I can work up a sweat and get my heartrate elevated. I wish the manufacturer would find a way to get the feet from sliding forward as you push."
4,Good value,"I have this under my desk at work. It provides a nice distraction from the work day. It is noisier than a magnetic resistance unit but not too noisy. You can carry on a conversation while using it. The resistance is adjustable from extremely easy to pedal to not very difficult to pedal. This is OK with me because I'm looking to burn some calories while sitting at a desk for eight hours, but I don't want to work up a stinky sweat. I have not used it above desk with my arms, but the pedals are small enough to grap with your hands. The unit can tend to slide on the floor if you let it get too far in front of you.It is easy to assemble and comes with all necessary tools. The LCD readout gives you an idea of what you have done, although I doubt the accuracy of the distance and speed. Still, it performs just as I expected. This is a good product at a good price."
1,Falls apart,"Right pedal continually falls off (about once every 50 rotations), slides on the carpet, tension isn't changeable despite turning the tension knob, feet stabilizers fall off, doesn't pedal smoothly. RETURNING THIS PRODUCT SAME DAY I GOT IT!"
1,"slides, then dies","They slide around on the floor because they don't have enough traction on the feet compared to the resistance, and after a very short period of use, something in the guts of it breaks and it goes *clunk* with every turn. We've gone through 2 of them."
1,Broke First Day,Unit came very poorly put together. I had to personally tighten a few screws and the pedal nut seems to be stripped & useless after an hour of use. I'll be calling to return this item.
3,Not Quiet Enough For Cubeland,While this seems to be a good exerciser the fact that it works with a tension band makes it much too loud to use in the cubical farm I work in.
3,Nice for under desk.,I purchased this for use under my desk since I seem to spend more time working than anything else. It works very well due to it's low height and as others have stated it does have a tendency to creep forward during use but not to the extent that it is unuseable. The machine is pretty smooth and doesn't make much noise during use. The only main problem is that the tension adjustment doesn't seem to do anything. I can turn it to either direction and it does not make the unit easier or harder to pedal. I still use it since the tension is at approximately midrange. I cannot compare this unit to others since I have never tried any other machine.
2,Not heavy enough to stay on the ground..,I have a wood floor and this thing just kept moving around. I think if it was weighted down better it would work just fine. I ended up having to trash it. If I was able to keep it from moving around against a wall it would have worked great.. I just didn't have a place to put it against the wall unfortunately.
3,Color matters?,There are 3 nearly identical models of this product. They differ only in cosmetics. How can user ratings differ among colors? I believe that all of the ratings should be merged in order to get a better picture of the products value. (My rating is irrelevant. The text was not accepted without one.)
2,The Good News--It's Nothing Like Yola,"That's good news, because it's important for song writers to grow. Unfortunately, with the exception of the jazzy first cut and number 10--Days Roll By--this album is padded with plebian music you can hear any night, any where. If you're looking for a folksy, fresh set of songs, buy Eleanor's first record, Yola. This one is an also-ran."
2,You Get What You Pay For!,"I purchased these plug cutters recently to plug top screw holes on my floor installation. A plug cutter is a plug cutter right? Well not exactly.The hardwood floor I was installing included a White Oak border that was top screwed and plugged. I had a heck of a time making high quality plugs. The plug either broke off in the plug cutter (too short) or they burned leaving a visable ring on the floor.With my drill press set at a very low RPM I was finally able to make plugs that didn't burn but only when I used very tight gained plain sawn stock. By the time I figured out exactly which speed and which stock was best, the cutter was dull and produced burned plugs again. Argh!I ended up going to a local Woodcraft store and buying another brand of plug cutter. With its 4 cutting surfaces this cutter worked like a champ. Had I only spent the extra money on a high quality plug cutter I would have saved myself hours of aggravation. What's your time worth?"
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased a set of 3 which included the 3/8"" advertised here. After setting my drill press to the recommended 1000 rpm, I attempted to cut plugs in a variety of soft & hard woods. All of them came out with burn rings. I changed speeds on my drill press and also varied the amount of pressure. All attempts came to the same result. I ended up purchasing a 4 pronged set from Rockler and am very happy with the results. General Tools messed up on this one."
3,Chili pepper hat,I bought this for a Halloween costume and it worked perfectly. It was more durable than I expected and fit comfortably.
4,Could do without the tote and tiny sponge,"I love California Baby products and this one especially. Works great for clearing up congestion. However, the tote and tiny sponge that come with the product are pretty useless. If I didn't get them with the product for free, I wouldn't order this product in a tote otherwise."
3,Pool Basketball,Seems to be made of cheap materials. Not worth the price I paid. Instructions were poor. Ball is very cheap. However me and my kids still enjoy playing with it.
4,My kids were dancing!!!,They've never danced before but this video seemed to get them charged up. I have noticed that they are really happy after we have seen this video. I don't play it before bedtime - I do it at the start of the day and it really cheers them.There are parts that can be slow for a younger child (my twins are (14 months) the talking about instruments etc could make a younger baby bored. There's sort of a tempo skipping sequence and my daughter who prefers to loll around was actually attempting to skip.
1,I can sum up this book in one word...,B O R I N G...I wish I had listened to the reviewer who said NOT for anyone over age 12... I wholeheartedly agree. I have 2 kids who wouldn't enjoy this either. Wish I had my money back. I feel ripped off.
4,Really interesting book!,"This was a fun and interesting read for me of the goings on of what happens in a cemetery. My dad is a sexton and he is the quiet type, so this was fun to read and learn all sorts of information out."
4,A fun romp through the neighborhood cemetary.,"Chad Daybell's graveyard romp was a hoot. While not meant to be a serious work, it was none the less fun and informative. I passed it on to my friendly neighborhood funeral director."
5,American Dreams - Season 1 - Extended Music Edition,"American Dreams is such a wonderful series, it brings history of the 60's into view. I was raised in the 60's so it brings back a lot of wonderful memories. And the music is great."
2,What!? No Widescreen version!!!,"There is NO EXCUSE for not releasing this Amazing Series in its original widescreen format!!! NO EXCUSE! This was one of my most favorite television series, and I was really looking forward to being able to purchase this on DVD. I would never have guessed in my wildest dreams that this would only be released in the old 4:3 aspect ratio - they're only giving us a small part of the picture! My other favorite new series is Alias - it was broadcast in HDTV and the DVD series was released in the original widescreen format (anamorphic for those of you who know what I'm talking about). I almost bought this series today, until I realized it wasn't in its original format. One of the greatest new series, but the lack of widescreen kills it for me! If I'm expected to shell out nearly $80 for the whole season then I expect to be able to watch it exactly as it appeared on my TV when I watched it!!! This is unacceptable!!!"
5,Excellent writing!,"If you are 35 to 60 years old and a little nostalgiac, you will love this series. I really like this show! It is very well written, and the actors give excellent performances every episode."
4,An Excellent and Accurate picture of the mid-60's,"This was by far my favorite drama series on TV for three seasons. I was in high school and college during the same time period as the series portrays, so it is like deja vu with many scenes and story lines. This series is extremely well written and acted perfectly by all the charachters.As well as an excellent depiction of the major events of the 1960's, the music is spot on with each time period for each season. The stars portraying individual music greats like Brenda Lee, Eric Burdon, Nancy Sinatra and many more all do a very convincing recreation of the individual American Bandstand appearances. The mixing of original AB film clips into the story and scenes of Meg and Roxanne on Bandstand really make this part of the story come alive.VietNam, Civil Rights movement, student protests and arrests are all portrayed perfectly, at least from my recollections.I can highly recommend this AD Season One set for everyone, regardless of age and background.GD"
5,Aaaaah (heavenly host of angels. Obviously),"I've always loved this show and and wanted it, ever since it went off air unexpectedly years ago. It's great, love the extras, love all the way around."
5,Just wonderful,"What a great family program. It's so nice to enjoy this too short-lived program. The extended music and behind the scenes interviews add to the whole scenario. If you enjoyed ""American Dreams"", this is a must for your collection."
5,Still missing this show very much!,"Yes, it's been a while since this has been off the air but it's still a shame that this show was never given more of a chance for it to survive longer than it's 3 seasons. This was a wonderful, wholesome family show and I firmly believe that NBC pulled the plug on this one way to soon. A show like this is just what is needed during these uncertain economic and political times. To go back to a time when life was more structured with good old fashioned family values, something that is so incredibly lost today. A time where all American's fully believed in their country."
5,irritated,"i liked how ""ANOTHER FAN"" says that theywere shocked and irritated when the serieswent off the air. well i was irritated thata show THIS GOOD got clobbered by the station...first by pulling the show from it's sundayviewing time (killing it on wednesday nights)...and second by an incredible lack of promotion!!!"
5,American Dreams - the best show on tv!,"This is an amazing show with an extrodinary cast! This dvd set has great music and tells an interesting and heartfelt story of a family in the 1960's. It will make you cry and laugh and make you feel like part of the Pryor family. It takes you back in time and you are able to relieve some tragic and poignant moments in our history, but it also takes you back to a time when are nation was full of optimism and hope. It is definetely worth buying this dvd set! I cannot wait till the second and third season come out!"
4,I Live The American Dream,"American Dreams is one of my favorite shows on TV, the whole family can watch I wish more and more people would tune in this is one of the best shows on tv.The DVD is fab I suggest you buy it as maybe a xmas gift for someone they will love it!!."
5,Fantastic show !,"Possible the best show television as ever created. I was mesmerized. I'm 54 years old and I didn't think I would ever find another show on TV worth watching. It is simply wonderful, a show for all ages. A future classic. I really can't wait for the other 2 seasons, hope there out soon."
1,Only a partial set,It was only PART of season one..not the whole season.I had to go to ebay to buy a complete set.Sellers should be more aware of what they're selling or at least make an effort to properly list things.Very deceptive.
2,Not much so far....,"Almost done with my first bottle and i have to say I have not noticved any significant gains to speak of. I'll most likely move on to another product. I'm 47, 217lbs., avid weight lifter, been working out sing i was 16. I'll keep everyone posted on the next product I decide to try."
2,No effect,I took the entire bottle and saw no difference with anything. I work out regularly. No change in the sex drive or any other boost. I was bummed and would not recommend this.
3,What This Set Contains,This set contains the following films:1) Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959)2) Beast from Haunted Cave (1960)3) Beast of Yucca Flats (1961)4) Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter (1965)5) Monster Maker (1944)6) Secret of the Loch (1934)7) She Demons (1958)8) She-Beast (1965)9) Snow Creature (1954)10) Track of the Moonbeast (1976)11) Night Fright (1968)
2,Let's talk Turkey,"In time for Thanksgiving...you can get ""The Greatest Songs Ever:Turkey"" from TIME-LIFE! Play it alongside the cranberry sauce and stuffing.Turkey is an interesting place,at the crossroads of Europe&Asia.Its; music has ancient roots.However,this album is generic Middle Eastern music at best,it would make good background music for a restaurant that serves hummus and falafels.Nem,Cengiz Teoman and Sukriye Tutkum provide the few highlights,blending Turkish traditions with modern sensibilities.The Esin Engin Orchestra,which has alright instrumentals,might be good muzak--or exotic music,depending on one's mood.If you're interested in Turkish music,seek out Tarkan (the Turkish Ricky Martin),Ilhan Ersahin (who makes smooth Turkish jazz)or Putumayo's ""Turkish Groove"" instead.That's genuine Turkish Delight."
4,IN FOR THE RIDE OF THEIR LIVES!,"He's fast. She's furious. They're in for the ride of their lives. If you are into NASCAR and want to get a glimpse of the real ""behind the scenes"", this is your story. The ending is a little rushed and the ""bad guy"" isn't hard to figure out, but the overall story is a good read."
4,WOW what a great read,"I rely a little bit on other readers reviews to help me make reading choices and lets face it, sometimes the 4 and 5 star ratings do not live up to the rave reviews. This was not the case with this book! I read this in a day, and now I will go back and read it again, cuz I was so caught up in the story I feel I need to go back and do it again... slower this time. You don't need to be to a NASCAR fan to enjoy this book, it has romance, drama and suspense, all the things I enjoy in a book."
2,Doesn't Fit,"I bought the lapidary kit, which came in a very impressive box, but was not, itself, very impressive.I never got a chance to use any of the wheels as they were too small for the dremel bit. When Icompared them to the wheels, etc., that came with the dremel, their shaft was approximately one-halfthe diameter of the original dremel shafts. In fact, I bent one by using it in putting in a new shaft.I think they may be fine if the shaft fit, but I cannot be sure since I cannot use them to find out."
2,Pendulum of War,"I have read numerous books dealing with the Western Desert campaigns of WW2, and this is by far the most revealing of some of the individuals involved and the manner in which the various stages of the conflict were waged. In particular the battles of El Alamein, all 3 of which, in their own individual ways, overall proved the turning point of the campaign. This book provides a detailed, but easy to read account of these battles, the commanders and troops involved, and how they fit into the desert campaign as a whole between 1941 and 1942, culminating in the final swing of the pendulum of war and victory from the 3 battles of El Alamein."
4,Hot Wheels Beats That,My son loves this game. He likes racing and a hot wheels collector...so this gives him the best of both.
3,NO BALLADS ON THIS BABE,"A real rocker for Speedwagon, nothing but straight ahead rock and roll. On their ninth album, the group puts out their hardest rocker to date. Before they became tied down with sugar coated slow songs, and syrupy production to go along with it(not that there is nothing wrong with that).Back on the Road Again is the stand out on this cd, written and sung by newcomer bassist Bruce Hall, this would be his best song for the group. Only the Strong Survive and Meet Me on the Mountain, are also great songs. Rest of the cd is good, group sounds like they are having fun on this one. Rock and Roll Music is weak, dosn't really fit into rest of the songs.Production is stong and gives the songs a raw feel to them. A good buy over all."
4,"Great album, bad conversion","This is REO's best album. A great rocker. The song Easy Money is one of the greatest unknown songs that I know of.Notice I said Album though, because I must warn you that the CD is a bad conversion. I really hope that someone remasters it. I noticed that on my cd that some of the guitars were hard to here and some seemed to be missing all together. So I played it in a different player with headphones and discovered that about a third of the way through that the left track was kicking out. So, thinking that I had a bad copy, i ordered another and was bummed to find the same problem.I cant praise the album enough, BUT if you know this album you will really notice the missing sounds."
3,Living on the Edge,"With two selections - Back On The Road Again and Only The Strong Survive - that became signature numbers for the band, this July 1979 release solidified them as a mainstay on the arena rock schedule.The nine cuts on the ninth release of the group clocks in at 34:24 and includes a cover of Chuck Berry's classic, Rock & Roll Music. Drifting back to the past with a more hard rock sound, the band's tour to support the album included the songs being played in order, note-for-note.Known more for the live performances, REO Speedwagon comes very close in capturing that energy in arguably their best studio album."
5,REO Rocks!,"Probably one of REO's top albums. You can't go wrong with this one. If you are an REO fan, this is one of their best! Buy It!"
5,One Hard Rocking Album!,"This is by far probably the hardest rocking albums of the band. Every song has a different flavor to it. From the opening of Heavy On Your Love to the fun hook of Easy Money with a great organ solo, this album really delivers some rockers.A really nice album cover with big cats and some really sexy felines as well. A definite for REO fans, considering we'll probably never hear anything of this caliber again."
4,My Son Loves It,"I just bought this book recently for my five year old son. Wehave enjoyed reading it together several times. I have always foundthat Ruth Sanderson books are a joy to read and the illustrations are wonderfully done, and best of all there is always a lesson to be learned. I would highly recommend not only The Crystal Mountain, but also The Enchanted Wood by Ruth Sanderson."
4,second hand,"I was so pleased when I found this book.. The book ia a little bit worn, but in good shape.. suites this Grandmother's needs."
5,More damn good service from Amazon,"This book arrived about three to four weeks earlier than stated, was in better conditionthen offered in the advert and is exactly right for what I wanted.It may be an old work (1978)but it has all the right ingredients for what I want it for.#Once again - excellent service.Thank youPeter West"
5,Allows me to reuse parts I already have,great product and nice to be able to find replacement parts so tath i can contunie to use them
4,Good,They are just refills.It is not like there is a brand except for 3M.3M now makes clear versions instead of these white-paper ones. But they do not yet come as assorted packages like this.
1,Glue not very robust,The glue did not adhere to the wall very well and sadly the antique porcelain plate which i had hung up with this mounting method fell and broke.
3,Glossy and gorgeous...but not much content.,"I had harbored high hopes for this volume. As a publication of LIFE I was prepared for a bevy of amazing, beautifully-shot photographs...and was far from disappointed. Stunning pictures of European villages, Asian scenes, and American Yules cover each page, thrilling the beholder with views of how Christmas is celebrated in various locations across the globe.However, I was very displeased at the lack of prose. Explanations of what makes a Czech, Italian, Korean, Australian, or Chilean Christmas unique would surely have enhanced the photos of them. Apparently the dearth of text also called for the absence of an index or other locator tool, which I consider a grave weakness for any non-fiction monograph.Besides dazzling the eye with the highly glossed gorgeousness of its color pictures, I would recommend LIFE to make their books more worthwhile to readers by actually placing within them something to READ."
3,What Can I Say?,Torn cover. Tear went across the front cover. Beat up .... What els can I say :- (Not my best experience with a book purchase.
4,Great Book for kids and adults alike...,"The great thing about this book it that it's fun to read. It has a lot of pics about legends that are somehow similar to the events depicted on Star Wars. If you are a fan of the Star Wars films, or just a fan of mithology, you will love this book.It's a great gift for children who are beginning to read, and are somehow familiar with Star Wars."
4,Everyday Folk Art,The book arrived on time and undamaged. It is a fantastic book with lots of wonderful projects inside. It has given me inspiration to start some new projects
3,"Great key rings for our lacing projects, but they're slightly expensive!","I purchased these for our childcare lacing projects. They are stylish rings and easy to handle, but they are a little more expensive than I had hoped (and found elsewhere). They are solid and the clasps are convenient."
2,a few gems and a lot of junk,"there's a handful of great songs, but they are all either on the first album (worth owning on it's own) or on the soundtrack with ""free me"" or the ""under a raging moon"" album. problem is this comp doesn't include many of the keepers off the first album or raging moon. at least the list price is pretty low."
5,Inspiring recipes from London's best Italian restaurant.,"The River Cafe is a chic place to eat delicious and earthy food on the wharfs of London. The modernist design of the restaurant is in contrast with the simplicity and heartiness of the food. The recipes in this book are terrific, simple and unusual. The appetizers and pastas are particularly excellent. Try the grilled calamari served on arugula with a hot pepper vinaigrette. It's a signature dish of the restuarant and has become a favorite in our own kitchen. I hear that some of the cake recipes are hard to execute in US kitchens, but who cares about cakes when the other offerings are so delectable? By the way, the restaurant is always booked weeks in advance, but you can get a table if you're willing to arrive at 7:00 p.m. and release the table by 9:00 p.m."
2,Game okay but mechanics poor,"I liked Zoo Tycoon but the dinosaur Expansion pak constantly crashes. You work an hour on it and get a black screen and lose all your work. The dinasaurs are constantly breaking out and causing it to be a hard game to keep moving. I mean they ate my scientist,then they ate a maintenance man. I like the original game and believe they could add more animals to it and forget the past."
2,Not worth the money at all....Dont waste it!,"This game is awful. the dinosaurs are VERY picky. they like a lot of plants, but then they run over them and get mad about the rubble. It is very hard to keep them happy. also, i hired a crew that catches dinos if they escape. when my spinosaurus got out and started eating people, they just stood there! all my guests were screaming and running from my zoo. Very frustrating, and a money waster!!!"
1,OBSOLETE!!,If you purchase the Marine expansion you get this included as a bonus. This is now obsolete when you purchase the Marine Pack.
4,An Interesting and Informative Read.,"Picking up where the first volume left off, The Early Asimov - Book Two continues to showcase the growing confidence and talent of a young Isaac Asimov. With these 14 stories the talent continues to grow. In some of the stories we see ideas that will turn up later in his Galactic series. As with part one of this two book collection, Asimov continues to write introductions and literary histories of each story. Once again, they are intriguing. As with any short story collection, it is unreasonable to expect that you will enjoy every single story. However, most of the stories are good. Loyal Asimov fans should like this book. It is definitely a worthy addition to the legendary collection of science fiction books written by a true legend himself."
2,Get What You Pay For,"I purchased these plug cutters recently to plug top screw holes on my floor installation. A plug cutter is a plug cutter right? Well not exactly.The hardwood floor I was installing included a White Oak border that was top screwed and plugged. I had a [hard] of a time making high quality plugs. The plug either broke off in the plug cutter (too short) or they burned leaving a visable ring on the floor.With my drill press set at a very low RPM I was finally able to make plugs that didn't burn but only when I used very tight gained plain sawn stock. By the time I figured out exactly which speed and which stock was best, the cutter was dull and produced burned plugs again. Argh!I ended up going to a local Woodcraft store and buying a [other tool] plug cutter. With its 4 cutting surfaces this cutter worked like a champ. Had I only spent the extra money on a high quality plug cutter I would have saved myself hours of aggravation. What's your time worth?"
3,OK for softwoods,"These are fine for pine, but I am ussually making plugs for hardwood items. Although they cut a plug, they foul quickly and must be withdrawn (using a drill press) and cleaned off 4-5 times for a 1/2"" plug. They also heat up and can scorch the wood, so the process is very slow. Lastly, when used on hardwoods, they dull quickly."
5,Wonderful!,"I have owned the cassette version of Orca Suite for over 10 years and I never tire of the soothing music. I use to own a Bed & Breakfast Inn and I played Orca Suite for my guests as ""breakfast"" music. It always got compliments. In fact, I'm going to buy the CD version incase my cassette tape wears out."
1,Not a cute gingham,"I ordered these curtains for my daughter's room b/c her quilt to her crib set and the bumper has squares of different colored gingham, but I was very disappointed with these curtains. The gingham squares were relatively large and the yellow was pretty bright and not a soft baby colored yellow as I expected it to be. I'm sending them back and I'm very disappointed."
5,Great for teachers,"My grandkids loved these!! I got a set of three of them, so we have nana and the gopichand band. The sound reminds me of a mouth harp only without the hazard of knocking out teeth. For ""real"" musicians, the sound is interesting, get a pick up and scoot especially bluegrass, alternate country, and punk. For music teachers, I think this is a must have for what it costs. Demonstrates nicely several basic concepts. I have all three, the soprano, the tenor and the bass. Changing strings is not easy on the soprano. Requires needle nose pliers or taking the thing apart."
4,A handy product.,"Great item and works great can't beat the price, and fast shipping. Thank You and GOD BLESS!!!!!!"
5,Great oppertunity to buy great book!,"The book is very expensive, could get it for a very good price and the book is in great condition!"
5,"Go, Entreri, GO!","Entreri is one of my favorite character in the Forgotten Realms, with Elaith Craulnober and Arilyn Moonblade. He's cunning and brilliant, and whenever he shows up I can't help but be drawn more into the story. His role is most important in that book, so that's why I chose this one. Although, he better be fine in Silent Blade... o.O Anyhow, I think he is much better than Drizzt >:) and the Icewind Dale trilogy was possibly the best. Now only Silent Blade remains for me to read..."
3,fingers?,"Well up until the part Artemis sends Drizzt Regis' finger, I enjoyed it. The finger bit urked me though, because the same thing was done in Escape from new york with the president's finger..."
2,Lackluster finish,"A disappointing finish to an otherwise fine trilogy, 'The Halflings Gem' attempts to wrap up some plotlines that began in 'The Crustal Shard,' but it fails due to a terribly anti-climatic ending.All would still be well if the meat of the book was up to par, but sadly, that is not either. Gone is the fast paced, non-stop action of 'The Crystal Shard,' or the roving adventure and excitement of 'Streams of Silver.' There is no suspence or anticipation as in the other novels - you know where the story is headed at all times, and you know how it will turn out. It's just a matter of trudging through the pages to get there.A stale ending to an otherwise fun and enjoyable fantasy adventure series...still the best of the TSR line of books, but the poor ending keeps it from getting on any other ""best"" lists."
2,The Back-Up Plan: Belly Laughs: Making the Back-Up Plan,"Save your money and wait when it's free. Loved the actors, but too bad the movie was not worthwhile to go to theatre."
1,Never ordered nor received this item,"Not sure where this came from. I have never ordered this movie nor received it. If for some reason you error-ed, but billed me for this item, please credit me. Thanks."
1,didnt like it,i disliked it. i started to watch it and it just was not interesting to me so i found something else
3,Liked It! And I'm not a JL fan.,This movie was laugh out loud funny. They both did a really good job and Alex O. is so handsome with a knack for comedy (who knew after his serious and stealthy looks on Five-O). Get it and enjoy it.
1,Not a movie,This is not a movie but a documentary about making the movie. I didn't watch much so I can't describe anything.
3,Jennifer Lopez-Meh!,I was ok..no big deal! I saw the movie and that was 'meh' as well. She needs to make BETTER movies..Period!!
1,"""MOVIE"" The Back-Up Plan","I agree with other reviewers ... these look like free ""movies"" at first glance and if,like me, you're not real attentive , it turns out to be an annoyance. Please note AT THE BEGINNING of the title on your web page that it's a trailer!! Not much effort on your part and will save YOU the negative comments. Thanks, Dave"
1,Not worth bothering with...,Too short....I saw no merit for me... I would rather have been able to view the movie. Movie not available in Prime.
1,Boring,I thought this was the movie. Never would have downloaded it If I had paid attention to the Headlines. Making the Back-Up Plan.
2,Waste of money,"Wow lets have women portrayed as neurotic, b****y, and crazy yet again in another movie. Yes we know hormones go full swing during pregnancy, but they didn't even bother really trying to make this funny."
1,wouldn't play,"Wouldn't play. I have an up to date new Mac, the video just wouldn't play. Waste of time.I need to add seven more words or my review won't post. So here's more than seven."
3,Turn off the sound and just watch Alex O'Laughlin,"The story was good, the script seemed okay, production values were fine... just seemed like the interaction between Lopez and Alex was awkward, stiff, wasn't believable that they were in love. Not Jlo's best performance and low chemistry between the actors, but a tolerable movie."
5,The Back-up plan is the best movie,The Back-up Plan was a romantic comedy that everyone will enjoy trust me I watched 1 million times and can't get enough of it and will nevr get enough of it! Trust me you will LOVE it as much as i do!
1,Pssssh!,I was like omg it's free :( swore this was the movie -.- psssshhhh but whatever I watched it anyway
1,I thought it was the movie,"I mistook this for the movie, and I was disapointed with what I got. I will read more careful next time."
1,not what I expected,Not exactly what I expected it to be. I thought there would be more information to it than there was.
1,Absolute junk!!!!!!,This item is terrible. I ordered two and both wont clear the wood out of the bit so it does not function properly. If I could rate it zero stars I would.
5,Both my 6 year old and 9 year old loved it,I wish I had bought 2 or 2 similar of this type. They were both discussing who could have what parts and loved being able to make these small vehicles. They love making small car type lego creations and this was a big hit!
4,LEGO: Simple Toys that DON'T Tear-up...,"As a Child not growning-up with these LEGO sets I must say that I really missed-out on alot of fun. This set is quite a treat, even to me (mid 40's). My 6 yr. old son likes his awfully well, and there's nothing to tear-up about them. This is his 1st LEGO set, so it took him awhile to understand the booklet showing the different steps involved. Once he got it, there was no stopping him...I'll definitely be buying my Kid's more LEGO kits in the future.This kit gets 4 Stars, simply because I'm not sure if others are better or worse (if there is such a thing w/ LEGO's)"
3,Pretty entertaining,"Totally implausible film noir but complex & entertaining nonetheless. Bear in mind its a Wade Williams release which ain't exactly Criterion. Picture quality is good; sound is so-so. The 4-star, rave review on the box is written by....Wade Williams."
2,"Starts out 40s noir, ends up 30s melodrama","Impact shows great promise in its first half, when industrialist Brian Donleavy's wife (Helen Walker -- the psychologist in Nightmare Alley) gets up to some homicidal duplicity. It's hard-core noir all the way, especially when push comes to shove on a dangerous mountain road. But then Donleavy ends up in Larkspur, Idaho, apparently suffering from amnesia, and falls for a girl mechanic. From here on in the tone grows sentimental and ""women's-picture""-ish. When the climax comes, everybody seems suddenly to start behaving like imbeciles. There's enjoyable moments in Impact, but it's too compromised to be vintage noir."
5,Nice core workout with cardio intervals thrown in,"This workout is all about the core. However, in true Jillian style, she still gets some cardio intervals thrown in - which I really loved. It's a great core workout with enough cardio intervals to get your heart rate up and a little sweat happening. It's not your Momma's core workout either - these moves are tough. It's nice having the 2 levels so you can work your way up."
4,Effective workout,"This video is effective and gets me sweating right away. I feel like I have had a good workout when I'm finished. HOWEVER, there are only 2 workouts on this dvd--level 1 and level 2. If you are doing this workout 5 days a week for 6 weeks you will get INCREDIBLY bored. I was bored with the workouts after a week. Also, I feel like the level 1 workout is a more effective workout than level 2 for some reason.If you aren't the type to bore easily with your workouts--read: same workout every day-- I recommend this dvd. It does work if you can push past the boredom barrier and make yourself do the workout."
3,"Good for Cardio, not so much for Abs","This is a great DVD if you want to sweat, burn calories and build cardio, however I felt nothing in my abs. I was looking to feel soreness in the abs, and I know you have to shed fat to build muscles, but what happens if there is no fat to shed? I would recommend this if you are looking for a full body core work out, not specifically abs."
4,We'll see,"Good, but I didn't feel my abs burn as much as I would have liked. I was definitely sweating though!I think I need to work on my form to feel the burn more.Just started it, I'll let you in six weeks if I have a six pack!"
4,good work out.,"i like the workout. some exercises are hard to do especially if you are older. i also have my ankle fused, therefore i cannot do some dynamic exercises like jumping where ankle flexibility is required."
3,Its not as good as her 30 day shred.,"Not as good as her 30 day shred, but still like & use. I mix it in with her 30 day shred & it works well having different routines."
3,"six weeks , six packs.","I gave this rating because even though Jillian is a great trainer and I love her, this wideo needs more cardio.but other thatn that I like it and would like to see more. I recomend this to begginers."
2,Too easy to get hurt,"My husband and I have been doing 30 day shred as well as Ripped in 30 for several months so we aren't new to Jillian Michaels or beginners to her grueling pace. We wanted to mix it up and maybe focus more on abs so we bought this DVD. After the VERY FIRST workout I ended up getting my very first exertion migraine and put a lot of stress on my neck and my husband pulled something in his knee which has now slowed him down in all of his other workouts. This workout is WAY too easy to get hurt doing and we won't be doing it again. We switched to Jillian's ""No More Trouble Zones"" to add some variety to the mix instead. This DVD is going into the resale pile immediately."
2,blech...,"I so much wanted to love this DVD- especially after all the reviews, I have all three of her DVDs from last year (30 Day Shred, Boost Metabolism and Trouble Zones)and LOVE them. I enjoy her circut training/philosophy in those videos but she breaks from that in this video. She does repeat but it isn't until you are half way done and you repeat the first half. She moves from moves to moves to moves not really allowing you to master them. I did not enjoy this DVD and have a feeling it will collect dust- I will stick with her first three!"
4,"I would give it 5, BUT...","I would have given it 5 stars had it not been SOOOO very hard to start for a beginner. I'm not even really a beginner either, I workout regularly and consider myself in shape. But my word, this was HARD. I can't make it through the first video. Which I love that it is challenging but maybe could have been slightly more geared towards an easier ab routine? But then again maybe it has to be to get a 6 pack in 6 weeks!"
5,"tough, effective, and fun","I love working out with Jillian Michaels, but this video is killer! I think it's harder than the 30-Day Shred or No More Trouble Zones (haven't tried Ripped in 30 yet, but it's next up). You do have to pay attention to form with some of these exercises, as it's possible to cheat and make them easier, but if you do them right, your core will be burning and aching the next day! This is not just an abs workout--in best Jillian style she combines cardio with strength and uses other muscle groups for a fuller workout. Really tough and effective, but also fun. I used to do Pilates for my core, but I like this workout better. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a great workout combining strength with cardio exercises, with a particular focus on ab work."
5,Just what I needed,"Jillian kicks my butt every time with this DVD. I prefer level 2 since I love that I feel like I worked hard afterwards, and after only 30 minutes. I've tried a few of Jillian's DVDs and this is the best one since it is challenging and short. By pushing hard with Jillian after just a few times I really felt different and noticed changes in my body. While you are doing the workout it doesn't seem like you are challenging your core/abs (there aren't lots of crunches), but that is the area on my body where I've noticed the most improvement right away. Because of the quick results of this DVD I am motivated to keep working out at home (with a variety of DVDs)."
3,Good except for.....,I like the basic exercises but she is lying when she says she has 400 pound people doing jumping jacks. My knee is swollen to point where I cant exercise and can barely walk on it... I am 250 lbs and read review of people who are in shape and have injured their knees.... Please modify the jumping jacks and any other impacting moves that will cause injury.... I will try this dvd again when my knee gets better but will march in place of the high impact moves that will affect my knees.
2,Not an ab workout!,"I bought this DVD because Jillian Michaels is known to kick your butt! I wanted to work my abs into shape but halfway through the video my arms and legs were burning and my wrists hurt so bad I had to stop the video. I understand why Jillian likes to add cardio into every workout, but when I bought the video I wanted an AB workout not a cardio workout. I get my cardio in other ways. If you want a hardcore ab workout, this is not the video for you."
2,not just abs,"Maybe this is Jillian Michaels' style, but this ab work out includes a lot of aerobic movements and a light weight. I was looking for something solely ab-focused and mat-based, like the abs of steel I had when I was younger, and this is not it."
1,Disappointed! Not what I expected,"I LOVE Jillian's workouts, so I thought that this video would be all about abs and it would be great. It's NOT! It is fast paced cardio with some ab exercises. Not like her 30 day shred where she explains what she is doing, helping make sure you are doing the exercises correctly. You can EASILY get hurt with this video. I would send it back but probably not worth it if I have to pay a shipping fee. This one will definitely collect dust."
3,Not true,Well u can achieve it if u dun eat any meals at all. Most of the works out we're the same routine. Just longer in duration or shorter..
4,Looking Forward to This,"I sat and watched the video as I always do when I get an exercise video. I like to sit and watch it all the way through, then the next day I begin. Looks challenging and I look forward to the workout. Definitely going to stick with it for the entire six weeks and see exactly what results come out of it. I recently gave up my gym membership. The group classes started too late, I was getting bored and therefore achieving no results. I think this DVD is going to make a big difference for a lot less money than my pricey monthly gym membership."
4,Alternating Sides,"I like this DVD, but my problem with this workout is that it's kind of scattered. There isn't the usual 'do this side of your abs, then switch and do the other.' Instead you do your 'right side' or whichever you choose and do a move and then go do a completely different exercise! Then about 5 moves later you return and to this move and she says 'now do your opposite side' --as if I can remember!?!?! I think she's trying to keep it interesting, or perhaps it was poor editing, but instead I just think it looks like there wasn't really a plan going into these routines.Some moves she does more than other moves. At some point she says 'Now take it from the top!' and I can't figure out which 'top' she's talking about because we've circled around so many times!All in all though I think it's getting results. :-)"
3,Tough workout!,"I have done the tape once and although I cannot say anything in terms of the results after one workout, I will say that it is incredibly difficult. I am not unfamiliar with hard work. I ran 3 full marathons last year in 2 months as well as a handful of half marathons, 10k's and 5k's. It has been a few months since I have exercised regularly since I am taking a break from training for races so that may have something to do with it. Still I found that it was more cardio based than ab centered specifically... which I like because it is an all around workout. The workout does a warm up and then goes through a set of circuits/intervals and it is repeated twice. If you are level one the workout is modified by not using weights and by adjusting form. I couldn't even get through the second set of circuits for level 1. I will keep trying it but if you are new to exercise I think this DVD will discourage you. I love Jillian's power sculpt and Bob Harper's yoga for weight loss better personally."
5,Terrific*****,I buy this video because the reason you have time to see results.Jillian is specified with the exercises and change is good! Combined with good food is a SUCCESS! I'll buy kickboxing dvd to give more strength to my body that is almost ready for summer!
3,Just not feeling it in the abs!,"This seems to be a great cardio workout and I guess I'm burning fat. I know I've built stamina and have stronger planks but from the get-go, I've not felt sore in my abs (although...come to think of it, I may have felt a teeny bit sore w/ part 1 but not at all with part 2). It feels like a good workout and I'm always sweating when I finish. My fitness level is high -- jog 3x/wk (3-5 mi), 2x/wk - gym for strength and/or yoga/pilates classes and have been doing this 5x/week for almost six weeks. I did notice that while in the beginning, I couldn't do all the mountain climbers/burpies, I can now do them all. Sadly, I am not seeing anything! I am definitely sore in my quads (esp. just above my knees) and gluts but I don't see/feel any difference in my abs... Pretty bummed about it as I've got one of those not-so-lovely c-section pooches!!"
3,NOT GOOD FOR BAD KNEES,"THese workout look pretty basic and easy to follow.. but once starting them I am convinced that the only good workouts for someone with bad knees are ellipticals and similar machines.. jumping, bouncing, squating with weights are no good for bad knees.."
2,Disappointed,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE Jillian Michaels and her DVDs. I own 6 week six-pack, 30 day shred, No more trouble Zones, Ripped in 30, and just purchased Body Revolution. I wanted to love this DVD, and I tried so hard to like it. I gave both workouts on the DVD several chances. Jillian seems a little rushed or distracted. She flies through the exercises with little to no explanation. Some of these moves really should not be done super fast because they could easily cause injury and she does not go over the proper form. Some of the moves are just strange and ineffective. I am just really disappointed and will probably never do this workout again. The first few times I did workout 1, it left my lower back very sore and borderline injured."
3,Sorry to say I was disappointed,"I love 30-day shred but was looking for something to really target my abs. I am sorry to say I was disappointed. I love Jillian but as some others have said, I felt nothing really in my abs. I was looking for my abs to feel sore the next day like they do when I do crunches on the fit ball, but I never felt anything in my abs. This DVD focuses a lot on cardio but doesn't make me sweat or work as hard as I do in the 30-day shred, so I will go back to the 30-day shred. Also I found it hard to follow some of the moves and when she cranks it up, some of the moves just seemed too hurried/fast. I was somewhat afraid I'd hurt my knees with all the lunges and quick transitions from move to move."
2,"Good but Jillan can be annoying,","We get it Jillan you are awesome and have awesome abs. Don't get me wrong this is a good workout but if you are the type of person like myself that gets annoyed with go to phrases trainers use don't get this dvd. Or do what I do, put it on turn the volume down and turn on your own music. You will be sweating and soar if you are a beginner trying this video for the first time. I did not last the six weeks because I got bored and honestly listening to Jillan tell me not to ""phone it in"" was ANNOYING. I use this dvd when I can't get to the gym and have very little time. Good work out just turn the volume down."
4,Great Video!,This video was excellent. Great exercises and fast paced. I own almost all of Jillian's videos and she has yet to disappoint me.
3,"Good cardio, ok abs video","I wish there were a way to give half a star, because I'd really like to rate this video 3 1/2 stars. As is customary with Jillian's videos, there is a lot of cardio in this one. I think this is a great cardio workout, and will use it as such. That said, I didn't think it was such a fantastic abs video. There were a lot of interesting and unique abs exercises in this video, but to be honest, I wasn't even sore the next day, and I worked hard and am far from in shape.I think this video will deliver abs results because it will certainly help peel fat off the body which will make all muscles, including abs show better. But don't buy this video without realizing that it is a cardio workout as much as, if not more than an abs workout.This is an edit: I should clarify that I only did level one of the video (way not ready for level two in terms of my cardio conditioning), so maybe I would feel the abs more if I could do level two without having a heart attack. :-)"
2,DVD wasn't really helpful,"DVD wasn't really helpful, I wanted more of less intense and concentrated. Might be great for some people but this product wasn't just for me."
5,jillian michaels 6 week six pack,if you really want definition and want to feel great . i stuck with and worked hard but saw amazing results absolutely worth the money.
5,Jillian Michaels: 6 Week Six-Pack,"This is a great DVD, it makes at home exercise easy and it feels like you have done an effective workout. I recommend this product to all."
5,Jillian Micheal's 6 wk 6 pack Abs,"This is an intense workout, I'm fairly advanced & I did mostly the beginner's positions -even on level 1 !! So if your a beginner just realize you may need to take breaks or slow your count down - but what a burn!!"
2,Expect a sore butt/thighs but little actual ab workout,"This is the 2nd Jillian Michaels DVD I've tried and once again, I'm not impressed. This workout left me sore, but not in my abs like I expected. My butt and thigh were sore from lunging and squating but my abs didn't hardly even feel fatigued. Also, my this workout left my neck sore for a couple days - I was not impressed with the safety of this workout. I consider my self in fairly good shape, as I'm training for a 1/2 marathon and am very active. But there are very few people, myself included, that will purchase this DVD that can safely swing a dumbbell around as fast as they can and maintain proper form and not injure themselves. I plan to but this DVD right in my rummage sale box. Another waste of money on a Jillian DVD."
4,Very Intense,"The workout was very intense, wish there were more than two worksout videos Some days I was dreading doing the same routine over again"
5,Just get it!,"I alternate JM's killer buns & thighs and ripped in 30 with this one. If you love her other options, you will love this one, too. There are lots of new moves. I tried level 2 yesterday and it was very challenging. You will sweat and feel awesome after finishing it. If you are a fan of JM's DVD, you will love this."
5,THIS DVD FREAKING ROCKS!!!,"Jillian is the real deal people! I've done this dvd twice so far, and I feel the difference in my body. I love this so much becuase Jillian has you all over the place with core strengthen and cardio wrapped up into one. I have neck pain when doing certain ab excercises, but this workout didn't aggrevate my neck at all. You will not get bored while sweating your butt off. My stomach is the last frontier of getting my body into shape, and working with Jillian will make it happen. The best part of the DVD was at the end as she talked to you during the cool down. She really made you feel proud of yourself, and wanting to work even harder next go around.I'm on level 1 at the moment, and can't wait to see how challenge level 2 will be on week 4. I was always skeptical of her on the Biggest Loser, but now I'm a true fan :-)"
3,Not one of JIlian's best,I ordered this DVD because I loved Jillian's Trouble Zones and Boost Metabolism workouts. I like how Jillian focuses on controlled movements in those workouts. I was looking for an ab specific DVD. I do not like these workouts because the movements are very jerky (more so in level 2) and I get a strained neck after the level 1 workout. I don't have the best balance to begin with and the faster she goes the more I lose my balance and correct form. I will still use the DVD but will likely stick with level one. Hopefully she will come out with another ab workout that will work better for me.
4,I am a believer,"This is a killer workout. I made it 10 days with level 1 and 3 days with level 2 before having to stop. My knees are killing me; I could barely walk afterwards. Sweat like a pig and no weight loss or inch loss. Will probably need a very strict diet to see any results.Jillian is very pleasant to listen to and very motivational. I believe in her workouts... just not for anyone with knee issues. If you are young, strong, can take constant pounding on the knees, then this workout will do you good. It is a challenge and a very difficult workout. But if you have any issues with high-impact workouts, or workouts that are killer on your knees, then avoid this one."
5,Good Luck!,"If you want a lying on the floor, easy ab workout, this is not for you. This is a tough workout (level 2 anyways) that will burn the fat off of your body. Sure, it has some awkward poses that are difficult, but I take that as a challenge and am loving the results. It is a cardio workout, which some people seem upset about. Cardio burns fat people! You cant just do abs and get a flat stomach, you have to burn the fat off as well. Be sure to start with level one, unless you are already pretty fit. I will admit that even with being comfortable with insanity, this was a tough workout."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,I bought this dvd because I thought it was helpful to improve my core. I'm 28 years old and I usually go to the gym 4 times a week. I started to use the dvd for 1 week but it is very hard and I'm not able to make true some of the exercises...the results at the end of the week was my body over-stressed and no results at all. I started to use exercisetv.tv (Cindy Whitmarsh) and after two weeks I can see the results!I don't recommend this dvd at all!
2,Distracted by the Hair and Makeup,"After having mastered the 30 day shred, I wanted to continue in the vein of Jill's 123 strength training and bought this DVD... it may sound awful but I was so distracted by the hair and makeup that it made me feel as though this DVD wasn't serious....who works out with a full face of makeup? really ..... Anyway, going to actually do the DVD and get past the foo foo that isn't Jillian Michaels.... stay tuned and in the future ... and just so you know, you can't go wrong keeping it real!"
3,hmmm...,"to tell you the truth I have not tried this DVD out yet, I have been too busy doing the other DVD's.But I am sure that it will be a good one like the other ones she has.I don't have alot of time during the day to work out so the short workouts she has are awesome to use for every day..And you do need to do it every day or else you will not get the full effect on your body like she promises.."
4,It works but hard on the knees,"This is definitely not a DVD for a beginning exerciser. The moves are effective, but some are pretty hard to do and require some muscle to begin with. I did notice a definite improvement doing it consistently but I also noticed that my knee was extremely painful - I thought it was from running, but then I realized it was after every time I did this DVD. The cardio moves (burpees, mountain climbers, etc done really fast) really hurt my knees for days afterwards. I'm in fairly good shape and not overweight. I stopped doing the cardio moves on the DVD - just the ab moves and then it was fine."
5,"Excellent! Definitely get your money's worth, and then some!!","This video workout is excellent. Jillian is easy to listen to, and although a lot of the moves are challenging, she demonstrates them in a simple and easy-to-imitate manner. I got the hang of it in no time! I am currently in the middle of my sixth week, but I started noticing results by the end of the first! It really works. Also, I am not really athletic by nature or an exercise enthusiast, so for me to really get hooked by a workout and keep it up for longer than a week, is saying something. I found myself LOOKING FORWARD to my workout, which is new to me. You will feel more energized and healthy, and if you keep at it, you will see results in no time! Definitely worth it!"
3,"It's a workout, but that's about it.","I'm lukewarm on Jillian's workouts. Her personality grates on my nerves, and the workouts aren't particularly fun. (And in general, I do think exercise is fun.) But, it is a workout. I have 3 of Jillian's DVDs, and of the 3, this one is my favorite. I don't see a whole lot of difference in the levels of the workouts on this DVD, so if you get bored with one level, you can probably switch to another without much effort. One thing I don't like about her videos is all the talk you're forced to either watch of FF. I think that was fixed on her latest DVD, but this one still has the crap at the start."
2,Eh,"I'm a big fan of Jillian Michaels (I own 3 other DVDs of hers), but this one is just awkward. The last few times I've done it I've pulled or hurt weird muscles, the last one being my left calf. I'll keep it in the roataion, because the moves seem good for cardio, but I'm not really a fan of this one."
2,Jillian Michaels-No more trouble zones CD,I bought fourJillian Michaels CDs from this seller and today I was exercizing for the first time the No more trouble zones CD. When it was showing the mat exercise right before the stretching...this image of the CD became very shaky and got totally frozen for a couple of minutes then jumped to the end of the stretchexercise. I haven't started the other CDs yetbut I'm afraid that this situation can happen to the other CDs as wellI...after I watch the other Cds I will keep in touch with Amazon and a seller to see if they can replace the problematic CD. I hope the other ones are okay.I'm a little upset by the inconvenience.I hope to Amazon and the seller to fix the problem for me.I will keep you uptated with what will happen.
2,This is Not the JM I Expected,"I purhased this workout on Amazon instant video, I was so excited since I love the results I get from my other JM videos ( 30 day shred, no more trouble zones, boost your metabolism & extreme shed) but this video is my least favorite of all the ones I own.I can't quite describe it but something about this video feels awkward, and I could not wait for level 1 to end, not because I was drenched in sweat but because I was bored and pondering getting a refund for this video. I will try Level 2 today and see if my attitude about this video changes but for right now this is a no go for me.On a side note there were walkouts in level one which I have done plenty of times from 30 day shred but for some reason I hated doing these, I think they do them too fast so for the safety of your wrist I would ignore them and go at your own pace. I also hope this is not the future of what JM is going to be making, just churning out videos just for the heck of it."
5,This video kicks my butt!,"I am relatively in shape - so I remember thinking that Level 1 wasn't actually that challenging. However, the next day? I FELT IT! And even if you think ""I'm totally in shape, so maybe this isn't for me"" - you are wrong! Level 2 is a challenge for EVERYONE! It's a great combo of cardio and ab work - and only requires one dumbell, or one water bottle, if you're away from home a lot, like me. :) Worth the money many times over!"
4,Great DVD Love Jillian,"I have done several of Jillian's workouts and I have yet to find one i didn't like. i have 30day shred, Ripped in 30, Shred it with weights andYoga meltdown. I really like this one."
4,Jillian Michaels: 6 Weeks to a 6 Pack,"This is another great Jillian DVD but definitely falls short of the 30 Day Shred and No More Trouble Zones. That being said, it is still a great killer DVD. Don't be fooled by the beginner label as opposed to the intermediate. I am a fit individual who needs to work out more than I do and when I do this DVD it is exceptionally taxing in the area of muscular endurance. The cardio part of the DVD does not compare to the other DVDs and I hardly broke a sweat at the end of thirty minutes. The other DVDs offer a far better cardio/toning combination. This does not mean the DVD is not valuable. It is and when combined with the other Jilliam DVDs for a weekly variety it is a nice diversion."
5,Excited,This is an amazing ab workout! Jillian gets your abs burning in the first two minutes of this DVD workout
5,Great! I'm beat!!!,"I don't know what this is going to do for my abs, but I'm hoping they will look as good as my body feels bad right now!! Definitely a good workout, I've only done it twice now, but if i can keep with it, I think i'll get results!!!"
4,It's a great workout!,"Two levels, both of which push you. This works the abs and also provides a cardio workout. You get a good workout."
5,Great workout!,"Love this workout, which helps to shape up the midsection. All of Jillian's workouts are very good about chiseling the inches off."
5,"Fun and Tough All-Around Workout, Not Just Abs","6 Week 6 Pack is a great workout - I had fun doing both level 1 and 2, found them both very challenging (especially level 2) and I switch up between level 1 and 2 with other workouts. I often tack on 6 Week 6 Pack to a Ripped in 30 workout and find that I get a great 45-50 minute workout that leaves me feeling energized and accomplished. Something that I like about both level 1 and 2 is that they seem to go by really fast and I never get bored. Unlike the Shred workouts and other JM DVDs, the longer circuit keeps things interesting and doesn't feel repetitive. The only downside to this setup is that sometimes I'm dreading one move knowing that it's coming towards the end and I can't get it over with 'til then.I also felt that these 2 particular workouts added a new definition to my body (not just in my abs) that I hadn't had before. I use 4 lb. weights, and find that it provides me the right amount of resistance to the moves.Thanks, Jillian!"
4,6 Week Six Pack Video,"I've only been using this video for about 2 weeks, which isn't long enough to see results, but I can definitely say that I end this workout sweating. It includes both standing & floor exercises, and several variations of the plank position without the typical static hold. I am a runner and I wanted to incorporate more abdominal exercises into my routine. Although I doubt that I will see a ""six pack in six weeks"", I would recommend this video to someone looking for something new."
5,Love it!,I work out five days a week and found this to be a great work out. I really enjoy Jillian's training style and own 30 Day Shred as well.
4,Love to hate her :),"At first I was really put off by this dvd, it wasn't the ab workout I was expecting. But the ""hiit"" aspect of these workouts really rock. I had gotten to the point where the ""No More Trouble Zones"" dvd was getting easy and this one kicked my behind! It will probably never be my favorite, but I do use it often because the results are there. It's a great way to get a serious workout is a short time, too. It's that classic Jillian we a love to hate, while she's making you hurt, she's making you feel great."
5,Great workout!,Now into the forth week of the 6 week 6 pack. Fabulous workout! Would recommend the video if you enjoy a good workout. I do the level 2 workout and it makes me sweat bullets every time. My core is getting stronger but my abs will not look like the ladies' abs in the video after 6 weeks as I am 25 lbs over weight.
5,Ouch,"I read the reviews for this DVD and thought I would try it. The only other Jillian Michael's DVD I have owned is the 30 Day Shred. I liked it, but the 3-2-1 wasn't my favorite. I recently started the 6 Week Six-Pack and it definitely works. After the first time I finished the workout, the next few days my abs felt a little firmer. I decided to watch ahead and see what moves will be in Level 2... big mistake. Some of her moves are very scary looking. I'm glad I watched ahead so I won't have to take as much time to adjust when she switches moves as that seems to be a common issue with the DVD, but at the same time, I think I would have preferred dying after 3 weeks instead of having to dread it now. Definitely recommend buying this."
4,Great workout,"I have not tried any of Jillians other workout DVD's... but this one kicks my butt. I made it halfway through the first time, 5 minutes farther the second time, and now I'm trying my best gradually to just make it all the way through. My inner thigh muscles are much weaker than I suspected.It's a great workout, and I could feel the results the first week in both my abs and thighs. This video has made me want to try her others as well... And at $8, I probably will."
5,"great workout, it's a challenge, get ready to sweat","I love this workout because it gives you a challenge and allows you to get even stronger. Anyone who has done Jillian workouts knows she means business in the gym. This dvd is no different. I have done several Jillian workouts and I personally think this one is the toughest just because it is so rigorous. This dvd is not for beginners. Like I said, I do Jillians workouts on a regular basis and it was tough for me. If you are looking for a challenge, check this one out."
5,Wonderful workout,"Jillian, once again pushes us to the limit in this video. She encorporates both short cardio intervals to keep your heart rate up with the strength training of various ab moves. I do this video about once a week along with her 30-Day Shred and I'm seeing results!"
5,Really loved it!,"As I said in the other reviews, I'm a big fan of her videos. I'm an intermediate to advanced exerciser. I usually hate ab videos. I get bored and tired of crunches and situps. I really enjoyed this one. She has some different moves for abs that are fun.It's actually a full body workout. I was really feeling my abs the next day, which was a good sign. It is short and easy to fit in your schedule. My favorite ab video!"
4,It kicks your butt!,This definitely kicks your butt! I just started it but it kicks my butt! I am in shape and it wears me our! I love it! I can't wait for the results!
3,not for beginners or bad knees,"Don't get me wrong I love her workouts but with someone who has bad knees, wrist and back and a beginner this is not one for you. I couldn't get through the first ten min as I had my daughter and son trying it out they gave up also. It was funny we were all on the floor just watching instead of working out lol. I wish she gave a little time to be able to move into different workouts as it was way to fast for us. Over all she is a good trainer"
4,Satified with purchase,"I enjoy Jillian's ab DVD! It is a good variety of core strengthening exercises. I don't do it everyday, but when I can fit it in my routine I also feel good afterwards."
5,Are you up to the challenge,"Ole JM will work you and work you hard, if you can keep up. Wow, we started out using this and on day one we had to be picked up off the floor and we were covered in sweat, head to toe. Folks, you get exactly what you paid for! Men, be careful of some of these exercises, take it slow and steady. We started out thinking this would be daily, but I think maybe 1-2 times a week is best, unless you are already conditioned. If so, you probably have moved well beyond this CD."
4,Works like I planned,"I had used a friends before buying mine. He had purchased his over 20 years ago. It was packaged different, but it was the samee thing. It worked really good, but you almost need a drill press to work one. I was trying to do it with a hand drill and the work is hard to hold and it catches a lot. It works great with a drill press."
5,Cute and Great Introduction to Instruments,"This book is so sturdy and that is why it appealed to me in the library. But the story is super fun. It teaches kids to identify both animals and the instruments they play, with a fun rhyme that makes you able to hear the wonderful music in your imagination. My daughter, at one year of age, really seemed intrigued by the illustrations and I think she enjoyed the flow of the story."
1,Poor recording quality of a great song,"The poor rating is not for the singer, but for the quality of the shoddy product. The company didn't bother to listen to their cd! If they had, they'd had gone back to remove the annoying artifact noise in the song, ""Quizas Si, Quizas No."" If you're looking to get this song by this artist, look elsewhere. Hell, I recommend downloading it and not supporting such bad workmanship."
3,A disappointment,"I have been reading and enjoying the book, God Will See You Through, but I was dissappointed by the amount of under-lining and written comments in this book. Other second-hand books I have purchased through Amazon have been in much better shape, and I have thoroughly enjoyed them. This one did not live up to my expectations (based on previous purchases of used books) and although I will continue to use it in my devotional times, it just isn't what I expected. I think the seller should have mentioned that there was underlining and written comments on nearly every page."
5,God Will See You Through,"I recently purchased this book for a friend that is going through a rough time following the death of his wife...I purchased this book for myself, years ago, when I needed help and support for my own grief. To this day, I read it several times a week because the different articles are so uplifting in my everyday life...Throughout the years I have purchased this book(usually in the soft cover) for friends or family that were going through difficult times. I was so happy to be able to purchase the hard cover version...Thanks again Amazon for making products like these available and affordable."
3,works,This works fine hose is plently log for most applications. Was suppose to have sealer for gas line and this was not included.
2,does not fit Mr. Heater out of the box,"does not connect to Mr. Heater with out buying a cupeling piece. Purchase the Mr. Heater one, it also has a quick release valve."
1,Remember to pressure test,Mine leaked upon arrival... from the swivel on the regulated pressure side. DANGER!Also the sealant that came with it was horrible... I bought my own.
1,poor quality control,"received item in two days as requestedamazon package was sealed very wellthe product in side box was making loose soundsthe hose box was opened , parts inside amazon box was loose ,had to use , was missing valve that connected to propane tankno time to return items needed for partystay away from red draagon hoses shows red in ad but was just another black hose"
1,10' propane hose,"I ordered this hose and thought is was a quick release type, it comes with a regualtor and was not what I expected. I should have sent this back for credit but probably waited too long."
3,A useful book to have,I bought and read this book and there is lots of useful information here but I wish that the authors had gone further.May I also suggest Untapped Wealth Discovered by Jeff Marquis and Kerry Harrison as a good book to go along with this one.Untapped Wealth Discovered is good reference material and readers would do well to buy and read it after reading Daily's and Laurence's book.
3,Light weight use only,Will not double as bedside commode ( not expected to anyway ) and is not heavy duty. Will not help if infirm larger person. Puts so much strain on commode I expect it to break under any heavy load.
3,They're ok for what they are,"I got these speakers as part of the package when I bought a Dell pc a few years ago. They are attractive speakers that do produce a good amount of volume. The downside to these is that there are no controls to adjust the bass/treble levels. On some sound recordings this results in lower sound quality similar to that found in a cheap rental car stereo. But then again, they are very inexpensive. If all you want to do is listen to an occasional cd and hear the usual computer ""ding"" noises, these are a decent choice and good value."
3,Good information but poorly organised.,The Vedic knowledge provided in this classic work is as expected - a worthwhile reference. My only criticism of this must have book is its lack of an alphabetical index to assist in locating a particular Yoga.
2,Atwill plays the invisible keyboard.,"This little thriller is an early effort of Monogram Pictures, sturdy purveyors of cost conscious film. Lionel Atwill stars as a deaf-mute accused of murder. As in most low budget efforts, unintentional humor is prevalent. Atwill uses sign language to communicate. He wiggles his fingers while holding his hands palms down at waist level. This makes it appear he is vigorously playing an invisible keyboard. Once or twice wouldn't be so bad, but this takes up time through much of the film. Only his assistant, a real red herring, can interpret Atwill's thoughts. Packaged as a horror flick, the little scenario is a murder mystery with typical plot twists. A snappy newspaper couple, '30s style, trade verbal barbs as they work to solve the mystery. Luigi the janitor swears the deaf mute spoke to him as he left the crime scene. This serves as comic relief and an intriguing plot twist. The DVD transfer is average. The audio is about the same. ;-)"
3,CHARISMATIC ATWELL STARS IN COOL MURDER MYSTERY,"From 1932, Lionel Atwill stars as Jerome Breen -- stockbroker, philanthropist and possibly a cold-blooded serial killer (although that term had not yet been popularized). What's weird about the killings is that witnesses describe Breen as speaking to them moments before the murders although he has an alibi of being a deaf mute. The charismatic Atwill is remembered (if at all) for his roles in Mystery Of The Wax Museum, The Vampire Bat and as Professor Moriarity in Sherlock Holmes And The Secret Weapon."
2,This is NOT the original collection!!,"These are worth a look, but rent them if you can find them. As far as the acting/action/Kung Fu goes, they are not even close to the ones in the original Wu Tang collection. As far as the quality of the tapes goes, no attempt was made to clean the film, so there are a good deal of scratches and ""hairs"" on the film. The aspect ratio is goofy on most of them, making everyone look stretched out. Some of the tapes even run out before the movies end! All in all, not worth the money - even at the good price they have here. This set contains: Hell'z Windstaff, Faster Blade-Poisonous Dart, Wu Tang Clan, Invincible Armor, Iron Man, Killer Priest, Wu Tang Swordmen, Godz of Wu Tang, Son of Wu Tang, Shaolin vs. Wu Tang 2, and 'Ol Dirty Kung Fu."

1,"playset worthless, magnetic spidey fun until it lost head","my niece loved the magnetic spidey, though we paid alot for the playset, it was absolutly junk. My niece loved sticking magnetic spider-man to the metal door edge and refrigerator, until the head fell off outside when she was running around. the whole family searched for two hours but we never found the head. This spider-man would be worth it to buy without the playset--Marvel should release a better made spider-man with magnetic hands and feet--I'm sure it would be a big hit."
1,Got this as a gift and I am ready to return it!!!,"This is definatley not a well made toy - very cheaply made and falls apart easily. What is the fun in constantly having to stand the city up when it falls over?? WAY too much money -- even $5 would be too much, this is just junk!"
2,DON'T BUY,This was one of the top request from son for x-mas. It was either this or the web-blaster. I wish Santa had given him the web blaster. The skyrider set is poorly made and he cannot play with it without it falling apart. Right now it is sitting in his toy box in pieces. It seems that when you pay that much for a toy it should at stay together past the first 5 minutes. Save your money.
1,Falls Apart Constanty,My son received this as a birthday gift from me. It falls apart alot. The magnetic spiderman is the only piece that is played with. The set sits in a toybox
2,Save your money!!,I bought this for my 6 year old for Christmas. It was broke within two days. Extremely flimsy!!
2,Big Disappointment,"My husband and I bought this for our 4 year old son last year for Christmas. My son tried to play with it several times, but it kept falling over or falling apart. He loved the Spiderman movie so much that this was a huge disappointment to him. Don't waste your money."
1,This Sucks !,"What a waste... I read the other reviews but was still sceptical .. until I got my own ...The magnets don't work, the pen falls apart and Spidey hasnt actually killed any criminals yet. I'm going back to my Indian outfit - Sean."
1,Disappointing,"This was at the top of my son's Christmas list and boy was it a disappointment.It's basically a hunk of junk.The only good thing about it is the spiderman figure. It is magnetic and works well with the refrigerator and car,but not the playset itself.I feel like I bought [an expensive] magnet because the rest of the playset is worthless."
2,What a piece of junk!!,"Do not buy this toy. My son received it from Santa and it fell apart on the first day that he had it. It is flimsy and poorly constructed. When I called the company to request a part, I received it 6 weeks later. The set is a complete waste of money...just go out and buy a spiderman character and save the 30 bucks!"
1,What A Piece Of Junk!!,"This toy is a huge waste of money! My son wanted this Spiderman playset so bad for Christmas, when he opened it he was so excited. However,when we started to assemble it and play with it we found out what a piece of junk it was. It does not stand up and stay together at all. I feel so bad for him because he had the idea that it was going to be so much fun. This toy is nothing but a total frustration for me and my son. Do not waste your money. Toy Biz should be ashamed of themselves for disapointing so many little Spider-Man fans."
1,Horrible!,This toy was impossible to put together and use. My son quickly lost interest in this waste of $ because it took so long to set up and then did not work as adverstised. Buyer beware!!!
5,My 5 year old loves it!,"I read some negative reviews here, and was hesitant to get this for christmas for my son, but he _really_ wanted it. I'm glad I did, b/c it really is a fun toy. I myself have been playing with it too! We are having a great time with it, it's cool!!!"
1,"Not worth a dime, Not worth the time","My 5 year old son got this for his birthday from his grandmother. I couldn't believe how cheaply made it was. It was very unstable which frustated my son and myself. Because it is a spiderman toy my son won't give it up, otherwise it would have been in the trash by now."
3,Not Worth It,Save your money. My 7 year old son was bored with it after about ten minutes. The web trap is already broken as well. Go for the Power Rangers Megazords. My son and nephew both love them!
1,Seeing is believing,"I read the other negative reviews for this toy, and thought, ""I'll play WITH my child and have fun together."" That way I figured I could get it put together properly. But guess what, the other reviews are right. Even with an adult sitting right there, this toy falls apart...not to mention needing quite a bit of assembly in the first place. PLUS we also were not able to get Spiderman to ever launch right, which greatly reduces any fun of this toy. After just a few minutes, my child decided on his own that we needed to send this toy back and get something different."
4,^^,"Overall its a good watch, band is easy to adjust all u needs is a paper clip and a hammer. Alarm and stop watch is extremely cool. Though it takes a while to sync the time and date. Other than that its pretty good for the price i paid."
1,Dissapointing...,"If you want to see what Mr. Harding looked like before he died then you can buy this.But if you want to know what he taught buy his books. This DVD is poorly produced, boring,and will probably inspire almost no one... Douglas was a great teacher whose books speak best for him."
2,The nostalgia is finer than the reality.,"I bought this out of a desire to reconnect with my childhood. Blackstar was one of those shows I warmly recall getting up early on saturday mornings to watch. Having watched the episodes again 25+ years later, I find them a little nostalgic...and more than a little annoying, to be honest. The music is ultra-cheesy, as are the sound effects, the dialogue, the animation, the characters, and the plot. On the upside, my five-year old son seems to like them, and there is a sense of satisfaction that he enjoys the same sort of thing I did when I was young. My advice, buy the DVD for children under the age of 10, but don't buy them for yourself....just cling, cling like mad to your fond childhood memories of the show!"
2,"OK your going to hate me, but this just didn't hold up that well for me","I was a fan of this Saturday morning show when it came out,but when I started watching this I found that it wasn't near as good as I thought it was. The stories just didn't grab me like I thought they would and I found the animation to be very lackluster. I guess somethings should be left to memories. I give it two stars because my boys do seem to like it."
3,It's good but just made me want Thundarr the barbarian that much more,"Blackstar brought back a few fond memories but it reminded me even more how good Thundarr the barbarian was. I kept thinking, Thundarr had better plots, better scripting and much better animation. I was watching the first episode of Blackstar with the sorceress Amber. This chick had claws on her left hand instead of fingers and it was covered by a long red glove. The funny thing was that nobody seemed to noticed her left hand. I kept hoping someone would ask her about it, ""Hey Amber, You're a cutie but what's up with the claws?"" Oh well, I guess everyone knew about the claws except for me."
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this because of good reviews and because of the horrible reviews on the RCBS and Hornady models. This scale is .2 grains off right out of the box and won't calibrate any closer. During use, weights fluctuate anywhere between .2 and a full grain off. Just glad I didn't get rid of my beam scales. This thing is dangerous if its all you have to rely on. Don't waste your time or money."
3,"Not bad, not bad at all...","So many Star Trek books really...well, they really aren't very good. It was a pleasure to read one where there was actually a bit of character development.As per other ST books, there are lots of typos, misspellings, and obvious spell-check grammar mistakes - can someone PLEASE actually read these books before they are published! But this writer is head and shoulders above other ST writers who are often barely readable. This novel was well written, had flow, and an interesting story. Worth $ for a paperback."
4,Entertaining Novel.,"""What Price Honor?"" (this title sounds more appropriate for a Klingon-themed book) is entertaining. It is a fast read. The author does a nice job of fleshing out the Lt. Reed character.Yes, the so-called mystery is no mystery at all.The core of the novel wasn't plot but emotion: Lt. Reed, Alana Hart, regulations, duty to Starfleet, loneliness, and communication - be it human to human or human to alien.Recommended. Like I said, it's a fast read."
3,Earlier Editions are Better,"Still a good standard text--especially for beginning students, but the choices seems to be less driven by illustrating the practice and more about staying ""current"" with themes and authors whose stock is on the rise. Wallace, the original author, stressed the craft and was firm, but gentle in insisting that it take precedence. Recent editions seem to soften that stance, to the detriment of the book. Edition 3 or earlier would be my choice."
3,slks320,This book was aquick read but I wish it had more current examples of poetry. Thre are a lot of artists out there that they could have included to give a more diverse understanding to poetry itself.
5,Brother 1 Inch Round Paper Label (DK1218),"Good price - delivered quickly - exactly what I wanted. I have a Brother QL 570 and love it. Quick, easy and I use on both my Mac (OSX 10.5.6) and Windows (XP) machines and both work great with this product!"
1,"Must have item, with big caveat!","This item is an overpriced P-O-S. It is fused with an irreplaceable low-amp fuse that is designed to fail, as the plug end for the talkie has exposed conductors that can easily short out. You will soon be left with a worthless cord."
5,The Bi-Coastal Brooklynite Seal of Approval!,"This book makes an excellent gift for that displaced New Yorker friend of yours who gets all misty-eyed and nostalgic at the thought of slogging through slush while chewing on a greasy slice of pizza.I purchased this book for just one such dear friend. She really, really enjoyed her gift (which of course made me very happy) - enjoyed it so much, in fact, that she called me not once, but twice to read it aloud to me on the phone in her inimitable Brooklyn accent. She seemed to really feel that this book gave her a taste of home. And for that I will gladly give the book five stars.The little snippets of overheard conversation are brief and easy to read, making this a potentially great bathroom book. Enjoy!"
1,Depressed People with Poor Vocabularies,"If I had never been to NY, I would never want to go after reading most of this book. I read on for too long, hoping for a change of tone which never came.The quoted conversations were the words of people you would not want to meet. They were shallow, uninformed, mean, and long on the repeated use of common scatological and sexual terminology.I have been to the city many times and overheard thousands of more interesting and print-worth conversations.I always keep or give away books. This book went into the garbage!"
1,This book is so impractical,"""How to save money and time, don't but this book."" This book is useless to the average person. It only deals with the 1 or 2% of people that need to hide their assets. And his methods are so impractical, renting out a broom closet in a building for a mail slot? He even says that you might need to lie on a postal application, which is against the law, do get what you need. And there are too many stories from newspapers that are the most extreme circumstances. He had one good chapter about identity theft and shredding your documents, but the rest is realy far fetched. Do not buy this book even if you needed kindling...it's that bad."
2,Not of any real use.,"After spending very little time with this book I found it of no real value. It was full of 'filler' and not much on practical solutions or information. There are a few good ideas, but not enough about them to act on.I have been thinking about and acting upon security measure for years, mainly in the computer/online realm. Even here this book is lacking on any useful suggestions. Just enough to make you paranoid, but little else."
4,Getting a privacy education,"My brother gave me a copy of this book over a year ago, and I only got around to reading it within the last few weeks. While I hope there will be an updated edition soon, I think it has been worthwhile reading anyway in that it has made me think about how to start paying more attention to my privacy (or should I say lack thereof!), and how to start thinking more creatively about how to protect my privacy. Planning ahead is clearly important so I am glad I haven't waited until an emergency before starting my education. Also, I looked up the author's website where I have found more timely discussions of current privacy questions and topics that would probably be out of date before a publisher could get another edition out anyway. I'm the kind of person that wants to read a number of books on a topic in order to have a good overview, and I can definitely say this one has successfully got my attention pointed at this subject."
5,This book is a MUST READ!,"Tons of great information and varying levels of application explained....beneficial for protection from identity theft, personal privacy, mitigation of frivolous law suits, steering clear of stalkers, etc. Not only is the book fantastic, but the author also maintains a website with DAILY interaction with his readers --www.howtobeinvisible.com -- I highly recommend this book!"
5,Freud 9 inch Ripping Blade,This blade is awesome. We used it to rip 2 x 12's into 2 x 4's and it cut through them like a hot knife through butter.
4,Excellent Product,"In keeping this breif. I have an old model DeWalt that I have been struggling with hardwood rips on. Since I got this Freud blade the problems are gone, cuts are smoothe as can be. I will buy this product again."
5,Works great!,"I had trouble finding a local source for a 9-inch blade to go on my old Craftsman model 113 table saw. I use a radial arm saw for cross cuts, so the table saw usually only comes out for ripping. That made this blade aseem like a great choice, and when I set it up and tried it out it turned out to be a great choice indeed. A Rip cut on pine 2x4s ends up so smooth that looks like the piece has been sanded. So far I've also used it on poplar with equally great results."
5,Hard to Find Blade,"Anyone who has a 9"" saw knows the blades are not easy to find. This blade is for my older Craftsman tablesaw. I use it mostly for ripping (as designed) and for some light cross cutting. It does run quieter and with less vibration than my previous blade. I liked the Freud design and it's performance, so I bought a smaller Freud for my circular saw. The only drawback is the packaging is just cardboard, but the blade is mounted (stored)on the saw arbor, so that doesn't matter to me."
5,Great Cover and Easy to install,Shipping was fast got it in three days. I was headed out of town on a trip received the box at work and pulled over in a car wash and had it installed in the rain in under 20 minutes. Good product good seal and looks nice
4,A Modern-Day Pilgrim's Progress,"""The Legend of the Sky Kingdom"" is a subtly funny and visually creative account of several kids escaping their orphanage life and journying to the Sky Kingdom. The use of junk for the characters, backgrounds, etc. is unique, and the story follows a basic ""Pilgrim's Progress"" theme."
2,Customer Service,"I have been satisfied with this product, however, customer service is the worst of any company I've ever dealt with. I ordered a replacement charger and it took over 3 months to receive it. I received a card from them about every 4 weeks repeatedly stating that ""due to overwhelming demand the product is out of stock"". The card didn't even state that it was from Euro-Pro or what I had ordered. I would never buy another product from this company again because of their customer service and looking at some of the other reviews, I am not alone."
1,Poor useability,"I echo the rest of the reviews on this site. I want to add one thing. I wanted a sweeper for hardwood floors, and the Shark seemed like a good fit. However, the handle has locking detents in the base, so I was constantly pulling the head off the floor, mashing down the handle to get it back to the floor, or stepping on the head. Took about 10 minutes of that frustration to get it back into the box and back to the store."
3,I love the concept,"I've had our Shark Cordless Sweeper for almost 4 months. I love the concept of the product, lightweight, easy to story and it was great for a quick vacuuming around the house every day. It worked perfectly for about 1 month.At the 2nd month of ownership, I started experiencing battery life problems, but persisted in plugging in every day after use. It has been getting progressively worse. Today, I realized after a closer look that the product contains Ni-Cd batteries which have a memory and DO NOT like being constantly charged when the batteries have NOT been completely drained (contrary to the production instructions).Finding a replacement battery from the Euro Pro website is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. If I don't succeed in the next hour in finding a replacement, I will try to find a similar product out there with a Ni-MH battery or simply go Hoover based on other reviews."
2,"Works great, but does not last for long","I have gone through 3 shark sweepers in the past 2 years. My mother gas gone through 2 since Christmas of 2004. The shark works very well. It picks up dirt, crumbs, anything with ease. The problem is they are put together horribly. The first two I had the handles broke off. They were plastic and when they broke they could not be fixed. The last one I had was the new one with three speeds, but the battery would not stay charged and eventually it quit totally. Which is disappointing since I owned it less than a year. My mom had the same problem they just quit on her. I would not recommend this since it will not work for long."
1,This thing really blows,"I got this for quick clean ups for my apt, which is all wood laminate flooring and limolium....they show this vac picking up nuts and bolts, but it can't even pick up cat hair....it worked okay on the cat litter for a few months and now it won't work for more than 2 minutes without stopping....not worth it, this is a piece of junk, I threw my out, you are better off with a broom and dustpan."
4,"If you have a lot of hardwood in your home, this is it!",I saw this vacuum being used at a restaurant and went right away to buy it. We have around 1200 sq feet of hardwood and cleaning it was always a problem. This is great. I would not use it for any carpet area - not enought weight to work there. But it works great for rugs too. I gave it 4 stars because I don't know how long this machine will work but so far so good. I love the telescopic handle. I am pretty tall and I don't have to bend over to clean. I also love the little side brush but I wish it was on both sides. It picks up all the dirt by the baseboards and the doors.
2,Disappointing,"This sweeper is OK for cleaning up crumbs in the kitchen, but not much more. Its abysmal battery life makes it especially frustrating. It has 3 power settings, but I don't see why you would ever want to use the lower speeds. On high speed, I usually get about 5 minutes of use before the battery dies. If you are looking for a useful cordless vac, keep looking."
2,Terrible battery life,Good sweeper when it works. Battery life makes this sweeper a mistake to have. Replacement battery costs as much as the sweeper making this a expensive general sweeper. Don't wate your money.
2,Works good But??,The Shark worked great we use it for picking up the food my young kid throw around.. But the battery does not last lond and is all but dead we have had this for about 6 months I liked it while it lasted but I don't know if I would buy another?
1,worthless!!,I did not even get one full use from this product. It broke the first time I used it - just died. I flipped it over to try to fix it. It ran if the battery was placed in a specific position in it's holder. Once I flipped the unit back over it stopped. Unfortunately for me I did not keep the receipt so my loss. Don't waste your money. This is a disappointment and a waste. It is piece of GARBAGE!
1,not up to speed!,"This worked OK for a few months-then died. Too little use for this price, or ANY price!"
2,waste of $,After about 2 weeks it stopped working. I called the company and they said I needed a new part which they wanted me to pay for but I argued that after paying $60. I am not paying another dime. They sent me the new part and it worked for about a day.I do not recommend this product at all.
1,Don't waste your money,"Luckily I bought this sweeper on sale with a coupon. Otherwise, I would be very upset. This product started out fine: it's cordless and did run well on both carpet and vinyl. But after maybe half a dozen times of using it, it would work for 30 seconds and then the battery would shut down. I had charged the battery fully, so I know it was full of juice when I started. I was just very disappointed with this and frustrated every time I had to use it. Plus, it was too wide to get in the tight spots on my floors and it wouldn't go right up to the edges. I bought a Swiffer Sweep + Vac and couldn't be happier with it. True, it doesn't work on carpet, but I just use my vaccuum cleaner for that anyway. It's much cheaper, cordless, and has a swivel head to get to those hard-to-reach places. I was not impressed with the Shark brand and probably won't by anything from them again."
2,No bite,"Won't sweep anything from my rug and it's low pile. Keeps shutting off because of what is supposed to be a good feature, keeping rugs from being caught . Drives me crazy, on/off/on/off but when it tried to eat my bathroom rug that feature didn,t prevent it from trying to eat that rug and it doesn't hold a charge for more than 20 minutes and the swival feature has to be pushed into working. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I should have paid more attention to reviews."
5,Wonderful.,"I bough this when I saw it on sale for $40. My girlfriend vaccuums her house just about every day, and her previous cordless vaccuum which was also a shark died after about a year of using it almost every day. Her previous shark was a cheap one I think it sells for $30 regularly. This one is far superior to her old shark. It picks up more and stays charged longer. I would recommend this vaccuum at $50 or less. Its an overall good machine."
2,Too weak to do any pickups,"After reading all the reviews, I thought I'd give this a try. Going in I already have ""low"" expectation. It's not a vacuum and it's not going to pick up a lot of dirt. But I figure, it's portable and cordless so in a pinch it's not so bad.I followed the direction to charge it first before use. A full 24 hours just to be safe. Right of the bat, I was disappointed. We have laminated wood floor so it's easy to see the lint and dust getting push around by the sweeper. I even tried the highest setting and still no noticeable result. All that's difference between the speed levels is the noise volume gets louder!This fish is getting thrown back!p.s. As I clean it and packaging it for return, I notice that the dust clings to the plastic surface of the sweeper like mad. You'd think they design it so that it's easy to clean - inside and out. My 10 year old vacuum cleaner doesn't attract dirt like this!"
1,I too was bitten by the Shark,"Sad to say I did not listen to good advice, since I had owned a Shark many years ago and it preformed very well for a few years then finally died.I since had purchased a new vacume and had been useing it. After realizing I was getting tired of dragging out the electic vaccume I searched for another Shark, well I got his one and it worked for about two weeks. It looses power very quickly, about 5 minuteds after starting it up. I have tried charging it and putting it away, it looses all power within a day, then if I keep it plugged in it still only holds up to a very short running time.I am pleased with what it picks up. I am throwing it away because, no matter how well it picks up if it will not stay running it is of no use to me. Wish it would have been as good as the old one I purchased many years ago.From now on I will listen to reviews. Thanks for the warnings.Refused to listen, Janice Kirkwood, Gary, IN"
2,Not worth the money,"I've had this for some time now. Maybe it's just me. For the $60 I paid the only good thing was the large container. But the container is very messy I think. It says you need one hand, but it gets stuck in there in this corner. It doesn't pick up dust bunnys, it actually pushes them away from the front as I get closer to them. It's the strangest thing. I find myself chasing them around. If it does catch up to them it will just push them out the back. So now I have to go back over them again and again. I'm going to buy the Swivel Sweeper again & it's half the price."
4,Great Grabber,I have both wood & carpet floors & this puppy is so easy to use & clean out & I love it. I've had two over the past 7 years & they are amazing. I wouldn't be without it.
1,battery replacement,The sweeper itself is a pretty good sweeper as long as the original battery works. But try to replace that! I placed an order on Jan. 7th and ordered two battery packs. One must order the battery replacement from the manufacturer- it is not available from any other source. it is not until the order is made that you learn that it will take 3 to 4 weeks to fulfill the order. In my case over three months have elapsed and still no batteries. So my sweeper is permanently out of order. I am furious and will never again order any other euro-pro product.
2,"Ok, it's a SWEEPER , NOT a Vacuum!","For the negative reviews, you should have bought a vacuum. This is a cheap sweeper. It works for simple sweep-ups. You should own a vacuum for decent carpet cleaning. Handle broke fairly easily. Battery life got very short after several months. Even used as it should be I'll give it only two stars. But it is better than nothing."
3,Not much scrubbing power,"The brush kit works fine, but if you are buying this with the idea that you aren't going to have to put much muscle into cleaner your care, you will be disappointed. The connectors are also made of plastic. My first one snapped in about 30 seconds."
1,Find the true Truth,"The Martyrs of Columbine is a much better book, and it is based on fact rather thansuppositionThe Martyrs of Columbine: Faith and the Politics of TragedyThese ""martyr"" stories, no matter how well meaning the authors may be, are basedon falsehoods."
3,disappointed,I thought I would have sume laughs with this one as I read other people's reviews but no. I found George at this stage of his life coming off as a bitter old man about a lot of things. Still I love him!
2,George Carlin Jammin In New York,Wasn't as good as I was expecting. I didn't find his material to be that humorous.
5,Excellent work - More politically balanced,"By '93 - Carlin is much more openly angry in his rhetoric. Losing his overt liberal overtones from 70's and 80's. Skits included here are Desert Storm commentary, and a biting attack on White Liberal environmentalism.But his creativity is clearly on display here in a way that had been lacking before. Like many comedians, Carlin is best when he has some large issue in the public eye to discusss.Skewers darlings of the left and the right.But there is also a middle skit about small everyday occurences that bring people together. This adjoining routing tempers and balances the overt anger of the other two main skits, making the flow much more even and natural.Similar to his famous Driving skit (Carlin on Campus, What Am I Doing in new Jersey) Carlin here includes a wonderful skit on airplanes and airports that has gotten me through many an awful flight."
4,Perfect travel toy.,"Does just what it promises, in a very compact unit. The included extension cord fails to work with some computers, without consistency to OS. Can't figure that one out, but otherwise very pleased."
5,Good Product.,"I have the middle age disease, I can't see as well as I used to. This really saves me time and accuracy!"
3,Ted Nugent - 'Scream Dream' (Sony),"A semi-memorable catalog release,but certainly no classic.Originally released in 1980.It's okay as I've heard Ted do better.One factor about 'Scream Dream' is that Ted is now full time vocalist,taking over Derek St.Holme's job.I didn't mind it so much,but I've heard several fans state otherwise.Just basically decent Detroit-style hard rock with the better tracks being ""Wango Tango"",""Hard As Nails"",""Violent Love"",""Spit It Out"" and the somewhat funky ""Terminus Eldorado"".I saw Nugent out on this very tour with the Scorpions and Def Leppard as support acts.A show that I remember people talked about for many years to come."
1,This really deseves no stars,"I can't believe this album was ever made, what a waste of talent.The lyrics on this one are some of Ted's worst. Unlike earlier works, he REPEATS words and REPEATS words and REPEATS words and REPEATS words and REPEATS words. I could go on repeating myself, but then you wouldn't read the rest of this [just like you wouldn't listen to this album].Don't believe me?Then buy it and find out for yourself. But you will be having one big SCREAM DREAM if you do [haha].This one shows how Ted really needed Derek St. Holmes to help him sound good. He finally figured it out, but way too late. The legacy with these last trashy albums killed his potential as a great artist.Buy his earlier works [the first two or three] and save yourself from a nightmare. A real SCREAM DREAM!No stars for Ted on this one."
3,The old Epic records version...,"Good album, most anyone will agree that this in not Ted's finest work, but very far from his worst. I thought I was getting the remastered version due to the product description, so when I got the old Epic cd with no remastering and very limited liner notes, I was a little disappointed."
4,jeremy holloway,a fun album. i knew wango tango as the only song off this cd when i decided to order this cd i was not disapionted. i wish he would have done more like this. this cd includes arange of songs wangotango scream dream and dont cry this is a very hard rock album buy this cd you will not be dissapontedi give it five stars
2,"wacky uncle ted,s not so good scream dream","i think by the time this album came out wacky ted got a little too carried away with his wildman persona, for me, not too much of this album is good.i really liked 1975,s ted nugent album,free for all,cat scratch fever,weekend warriors and state of shock and double live gonzo. for me this album really began a downward slide for uncle ted!! if you are a rabid nuge fan and must have every cd he ever made get it here amazon has the cheapest prices around and the best online selection!!"
5,Excellent,"Bought this candle as a gift. We often have it lit on evenings together. It is an outstanding product in all regards. It is large and long lasting, with an attractive color and jar that make it suitable to keep out when not in use. The scent is potent but not overbearing. It quickly fills the area but never becomes too strong. It smells exactly as you would expect it to, like a bouquet of fresh roses."
2,Great scent but weak wick,"I love the scent of this candle but not the wick.Somehow, Yankee Candle's wicks are becoming weak. As a result, the flame was very small, generating insufficient heat. After burning my candle for two hours, the wax pool is still making its way to the glass jar. As a result, some wax never gets to release the fragrance it contains. I would estimate a loss of 50% of the candle that could not be burned because of the weak wick. I experienced the same issue with several of Yankee candles over the past 5 years. This phenomenon seems to be random. I wonder if there is a batch to batch variation with the wicks that Yankee Candle sources from its suppliers. It's a serious quality issue that Yankee should address.In summary, I love the scent but am very disappointed with the quality of the candle."
2,yankee candle large,this candle has a very strong wax in the air. it smell good though. if you have a big room like maybe 20x20 it might be ok. but my room was 13x12 and it was overpowering with the smell of wax.
3,Can't really smell it too well,"My sense of smell isn't that good, but I can't really smell this as well as the other reviewers say. I just kind of smell burnt candle. Not bad but not mindblowing."
2,Live recording,I didn't know it is live recording version. I don't like to hear audience's voice or clapping. I got I paid for. At least it was inexpensive.
3,This house is hell during the 40-year eclipse.,"A family of 4 have moved into a new house in Spain. The mother, Maria (Lena Olin ,Fanny och Alexander [1983]) and the father, Mark (Iain Glen) try to keep the spirits up for the children. Regina (Anna Paquin) is having a diffucult time adjusting to life in Spain. She wanted to finish school in the states. Hr brother, Paul (Stephan Enquist) is excited about the new art pencils his mother gave him. His grandfather taking notice of his grandson, Paul.

3,I was not amuse!,"Hey you Horror lovers:First let me say, that who ever liked this movie I'm happy for them..But for me, Being a horror lover, and have seen all of horror movies..from 1920's up till now, can savely say that for me, and others like me..do not think this movie was all that.I like the ugly gost they had, but not enough of them, and we don't know who are the adults in the picture. nothing was really explain, except that they wanted to sacrifice 7 kids, so that evil can conquer the earth. The ending was real lame...The movie (13Gost) was by far ten times better than this...infact..it was fantastic...so if you want a movie that from the beggining is confusing..all the way to the ending..and a lot of talk, but no action..and can put you to sleep, than this is the movie for you."
2,"No more ""Dark"" movies !","The movie was terrible.The acting wasn't a big problem but everything else was.Don't buy this movie and the unrated version is no ""cooler""."
2,What's with that PRICE?,"A below average film, o.k. but weak in to many areas that have already been reviewed in the other comments.So why is a mostly weak movie being sold for such a high price by Amazon? My reccomendation? $14.99 !!"
2,Good Plot but weak Characters,The plot of this movie makes a lot of sence. It has a nice and shocking ending. It just lacked the necessary character development. I really didn't care what happened to them in the end.
1,Needs an ending...,"I didn't like this. Shallow it might sound, but the ending is ludicrous and makes the remainder unworthy. Others have problems with the script. Maybe. But, even a valuable ending could have saved this fearfest."
1,"Horrible Movie, don't waste your money","This movie was so bad, it was a rip off of the Amittyville Horror (which wasn't the best either) and Stanely Kubrick's The Shinning, (which was awsome). I Loved Anna Paquin in the X-Men movie's, but in this movie she along with the rest of the cast overacted their parts. There was no suppense whatsoever, you could see it comming from a mile away. In my most humble opinion do not buy or rent this movie, if you want to see a father go crazy and want a good horror flick watch the shinning again."
3,"Very confusing and blotted everywhere, but ok","I didn't really understand this much, but somehow i liked it. It was creepy, not scary. I wasn't following the movie much, just looking at the picture."
2,"Great concept, poor delivery","I will try not to be too specific here so as not to ruin the movie for those that have not seen it.I was so disappointed with this movie. Anyone interested in seeing this may want to wait until they can get a used DVD for under $5.00. The plot hiccups through the entire movie as the characters bumble about trying to convince themselves that ""everything is okay"". Then, all of a sudden, they are magically aware of the problem and what is going on after stumbling onto a clue that reveals all. Also, the breakup of the movie into ""days of the week"" segments seems like the director was trying to bank on the concept used in ""The Ring"". Things don't even pick up until the last day and then, just as things are starting to get interesting, it is over. In other words, the movies starts with a fizzle, and ends with a plop. The acting was good, however, with Lena Olin giving a first rate performance. It was a shame to see such good talent wasted on such a dry movie."
2,Confusing but Best Effort,This movie was very confusing throughout the story. I have to give them gratitude for parts of the movie being fairly scary.The ending was very unclear and I did not enjoy it at all.It made me think that there will be a sequal. It left so many questions unanswered.
3,Darkness,I was so excited when I got this movie because it looked like it would be a good thriller. I got very disappointed the farther into the movie I watched. I guess it takes a lot more to give me a good scare or make me shiver because all I got was bored.
2,dissapointing,"After the hype for this one I was excited to finally see it since I missed it at the theatre. I'm glad I saw it before buying the DVD. It was slow to get going. Half the movie was over before it got good. It would have been salvaged had it not been for the ending. I don't mind good or bad ending or even ending that leave it open, but this offered nothing. Very dissapointing."
4,Be Very Afraid of Darkness,"I think it's a late release in the States. I saw it last year, and I've one advise for you horror fans, Be Very Afraid of Darkness. This is one of the creepiest horror movies you'll ever see. Forget Dawn of the Dead, They, Cabin Fever, even the new Texas Chainshaw Massacre, this one tops the ""scream chart"".There're some questions still but hopefully they'll make a sequel to tie the loose-ends. I can't stop praising of this movie, just go see it."
3,"One ""Thumbs Up"" and One ""Thumbs Down""","My husband HATED this film. Although I didn't Love it, I have told people it is worth seeing.The beginning/character build up is rather slow (actually I think the whole film needed to pick up the pace a bit)...and I was disappointed with the ending. However, I have not had many movies give me the creeps the way this one did. The ""scary parts"" are truly haunting. I didn't realize how much it had affected me until I found myself thinking about bits and pieces of it afterward.Darkness is in the tradition of the Old School Horror Movies, like Rosemary's Baby: it's not just what you see on the screen, it's what your mind keeps rolling over after the movie has ended."
4,DVD version is well worth seeing,"Guess I'm lucky I didn't see the theatrical release (quite a mess by the sound of it) because I thought the DVD version was just as effective in the 'creepiness' and 'dread' categories as Ringu or Ju-on. And director Balaguero thankfully eschews the cliche happy ending that undermines many North American horror films. His use of sound, light and shadow is incredibly assured for someone making only his second movie. If you are at all a fan of classy, well-made scare films, the DVD version of Darkness is well worth your time."
3,Doesn't have to scare you death to be fun!,"I enjoyed this movie in spite of the nods to ""The Shining"", ""Darkness Falls"" and ""Amityville Horror"". With the exception of ""The Shining"", in fact, I enjoyed this movie more. Visually, it's artsy, which adds to the moodiness conveyed in the film. Unlike some reviewers, I did not see the scenes coming...try to be in-the-movie, it's more fun.The ending was clever, and I really didn't see it coming.I think this film deserves attention. Certainly it's worth the price of a rental or dish-download. I plunked hard cash to buy it and don't feel I wasted my money the way I did with ""Open Water"" or ""Cabin Fever"" both of which I gave away."
1,I Hope Someone Somewhere Is Very Ashamed,"'Darkness' is hands down the worst film of the year. It is boring as all get out and probably the least scary horror film I've ever seen. The script is laughable and the acting horrid. Not to mention that every person in this movie is horridly ugly. I don't know if it was the makeup, the lighting, or just the fact that a bunch of uglies were cast but this film will cause erectile disfunction. A little piece of me died watching this movie. I want $9 and two hours of my life back."
1,"Awful, hard to follow movie","I was unfamiliar with 'Darkness' when I happened to pick it up at the video store. Seeing it said on the back, that it was the 'thriller of the year' I decided to rent it. Boy was I ever disappointed. The movie got off to a VERY slow start and the movie only seemed to get started somewhere near the middle. After that, it just went downhill. The characters never seemed to actually connect they just spoke at one another as they passed through scenes. None of the characters came off as sympathetic. I felt like actually rooting for them to be killed off. The ending is equally anti-climatic. Overall, a boring, not at all scary movie. Pass on this one."
1,0 stars not an option? A WASTE!,This movie was absolutely dreadful. Don't waste your time or money. The story line was a dud and the acting was far from mediocore. The story really didn't go anywhere and it was quite predicable. Not at ALL scary -- Not one bit. People were talking through half of the movie due to absolute boredom.What a waste.....I heard the movie company had this on their shelf about 2 years before they got around to making it. There was a reason! Better movies were made first.... this one shouldn't have been made at all.
3,slow and confusing ... but very scary,"this movie is about some evil beings that want to cross over into our physical reality. To do it, they need help; certain conditions must be met. And until that happens, they wait in the darkness. The acting wasn't as bad as some of the other reviewers said. the story was a bit confusing, it would have been a better as a novel with more room to tell the tale. And it wasn't action packed.But it was scary. One of the most frightening movies I can remember. Watch it alone, late at night. It's not a fun light horror film. There's a weight to this film... It has problems, mostly with the story and pacing. But I'll never forget it."
3,A good dark film and great effort!,"Ok - not sure when good films get negative reviews, what the viewer was hoping for... but I for one, enjoyed this release for many reasons. For one... great use of lighting ..hence the title ""Darkness"", there was some creepy moments thru-out and creepy characters that werent overused... great job with minimalism. Without giving it away the ending was very unexpected. This films leaves the viewer with the impression of a really ""dark"" film. Often films get too formula driven, where as I didnt feel that way with this one. I've seen the other release by this director and didnt care for it, but this one got my vote.(Eyesofchaos dot com)"
1,sucked thats all there is to it,it sucked so much. do not watch this movie. it may have had a some what good plot but it is a huge waste of time. does not explain much and has huge holes in the plot. I mean how am I supossed to be scared of a bunch of kids who just stand around. its just stupid
3,Creepy,"This movie may only have a little violence, but more terror. What sucked: There was not a twist in the end! Why, why, why!?"
1,One of the Worst Movies on 2004,"Darkness was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is horrible, the story sucks, and it is NOT scary. Do not see this movie."
1,B Rating would be a stretch,"This is THE movie that defines 'stink' to me - and I've seen some bad ones. I'd recommend not watching it when it comes out on cable. Really, it's that bad. I think there's better acting in ab-stretcher infomercials, more suspense in the Sponge Bob movie, and better cinematography, well, anywhere! I hope the original silver is lost before it can be burned to DVD."
1,I wish I could get my money back,It sucked on ice. Nothing was scary. They would set you up for something but nothing ever happened. The camera work was horrible. The only scary part about it was that I actually saw it. It was that bad. It was the worst horror movie since the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***Spoilers may follow!!This movie gets worse as it goes on... not that it starts great, but... Anyway, instead of relying upon real creepiness, they've chosen to use sound to make you jump (didn't work once for me), whether it be a slight burst of music or thunderclap, it gets to the point where you can expect it and predict it before it happens. They've also chosen to borrow a scene from The Shining (mother with a knife in the bathroom with young son, while crazed father is trying to break down the door)."
2,What can I say!,"I can describe this movie in one word - disappointing. The trailer looked so good as well as the synopsis, which is why I felt cheated after I watched it. A convoluted story, poorly defined characters, and a less than stellar ending makes this movie a dud. If you have nothing else to do and want some background noise while you do your housework, then this is the film for you. If you are looking for a thriller with chills I suggest you watch ""Hide and Seek"" with Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning."
1,huh?,"OH MY GOD!,just shoot me for looking at this movie.I still cant figure out what this movie was about.All i saw and heard was screaming, lots of door banging,and a whole lot of the the word ""mom"".You cant blame the actors/script-writers for this one, just yourself for looking at it."
2,Unoriginal in every way.,"When will filmmakers learn that if you populate a movie with annoying characters the audience could care less what happens to them?An irritating family moves into a haunted house and strange spooky things start to happen. How original. I honestly tried to watch this movie, but within 20 minutes I had lost all interest and just stared blankly at the screen until the snoozier of a climax.Anna Paquin, who's usually pretty good, does absolutely nothing to save this movie from the deep discount bin. Avoid at all cost.Also how is this movie ""unrated""? There's no nudity, very little cussing and just a little blood at the end. Wow."
2,Interesting Movie ruined by an idiot plot.,"Darkness would have been a great movie if not for the fact that the plot is ridiculous. It suffers from what Roger Ebert calls ""The Idiot Plot"": If any character during the course of the film says or does one thing, then the whole film will stop.Numerous times the Anna Paquin character could have done something simple to stop ""The Darkeness"" (including using a flashlight at times). In fact, all the characters act like they are on Ecstasy. And why would the police not know about this house??Also, the movie is supposed to be about a haunted house, except that the ghosts seem to like traveling on trains and driving around in old Volkswagens, alot.A very strange horror movie failure .."
1,Very disappointed....,"I saw this in the theatres when it came out. While the cinematography is impressive and very inventive in places, I didn't enjoy the movie at all. I rented this version hoping that it would clarify the muddy plot, but it didn't - it just adds cursing and some stupid swim club scenes. The actors and actresses are shrill and irritating, but most importantly, the plot makes absolutely no sense at all. There are three mysterious women who seem to be present only to scare the viewer - NO explanation is ever given to who they are. And when the villain tries to explain WHY ON EARTH he would do the things he's doing, his only explaination was ""it's science."" All of the characters do idiotic things and the movie is MUCH less scary because it's just downright stupid. It's obvious that the filmmakers only cared about making the movie LOOK scary than coming up with a decent plot."
1,"I usually love bad horror flicks, but this was awful","This movie was truly awful. The material given the actors was very weak, the plot had a ton of holes (which can generally be accepted in a bad horror movie, but these were GAPING!), and it was very predictable.So much was left unexplained - there were some things that would have been great to develop, but most of them seemed like a good nod to other classics (the shining, rosemary's baby, house, ringu, etc.).The art direction was great and the tension-builders were nice but they lead nowhere at all.The ending was perhaps the worst part."
1,"Great Plot, But ended up in the dark..........","The plot of Darkness was great, but they somehow screwed it all up. It was never scary, and it never made sence. The acting was very bad as well. I wouldn't recommend seeing this in the theater, or on VHS/DVD. The only time that would be a good time to see this movie would be on a 10 hour flight to England."
1,Horrible,"this movie was so aweful. I was expecting it to be a decnet scary movie but it wasn't. Their are a couple of scenes that shows some children in the darkness staring at one of the characters and instead of being scared you laugh because it is so ridiculous. At the end of the movie when the credits were rolling people were either laughing (because it was so bad),or just plain saying how much it sucked. It was total waste of my money"
1,Doesn't deserve a star!,This is just bad! Doesn't deserve any stars but I had to give it something because Amazon wouldn't let me give it no stars! Anna Paquin sucks at acting! I wish she died earlier! She is hideous! And she ruined Rogue! She should die just for that!
1,Just didn't get it!!!!,"I am sorry I purchased this DVD. It was vey slow moving; and after it was all said and done, I still don't understand what happened!! Very disappointing!!!!!!"
1,"Can you give a film negative stars? If so, this deserves it.","Please spare yourself this piece of garbage. Like some reviewers, I am forgiving when it comes to horror films. Couldn't forgive this. I don't care about the poor editing, the bad acting, the shoddy camera work, etc., I WANT TO KNOW WHO WROTE AND DIRECTED IT! It would be better for someone that actually does not hand over money to homeless people on the street/by the interstate with a hungry sign to GIVE them the money instead of paying for a ticket/paying to rent this film. You'll be mad at the waste of money and time. This film is trash, but at least I didn't laugh at ""Darkness"" the way I did at ""White Noise"". White Noise at least made me laugh at how bad it was. YOUR TIME IS TOO VALUABLE!! RUN! SAVE YOURSELF! IF I CAN PREVENT JUST ONE INDIVIDUAL FROM WASTING THEIR TIME & MONEY, MY WORK HERE IS DONE..."
1,Someone is selling this on amazon for 65 cents. reasonable when you could use the dvd as target practice,"There is only one thing I can say about this movie and I can describe it in three letters""L O L"""
1,Almost as bad as 'White Noise',"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen many, especially bad horror movies, I almost removed it from my HUGE horror movie collection. I bought it on blind faith that it would be good, was I wrong! This movie doesn't even make sense! I could not follow it at all! It's not scary at all. Believe me, nobody I know even saw it, don't waste your money buying this, or even renting it."
2,DARKNESS - DULL AND POINTLESS,"I really wanted to like this movie. Haunted House movies are always fun if they're creepy. The story is extremely stupid. Filmed in Spain by a Spanish director and crew I assume to save money ala Clint Eastwood's Spaghetti westerns. How they rangled Anna Paquin in to this is a mystery to me. There are some interesting moments that are creepy but nothing you haven't seen before. This film fits nicely among films like The Grudge.It looks good but that alone can't carry this film.If you want to see a creepy haunted house movie, check out ""The Legend Hell House""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005LIRD/qid=1115138382/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-9364400-1725445?v=glance&s;=dvd"
1,Darkness Unrated DVD review,"I just finished watching this movie and I tried as much as I could to love it. There aren't a lot of horror movies I don't like, but this is pathetic. Darkness is boring, confusing, stupid, and a waste of time. It's a movie that the filmmakers want to be smart, but turns out to be too confusing for a lot of people."
1,"Darkness lightless soulless, zero rating stars +1 movie star","The movie has no value as story, as cinema, as suspense, as anything, It is worthless. The dubbing is pre-Godzilla level, causing what little dialogue it has to be truncated.I give it zero stars but to post a review I have to plug in the minimum 1 star.I went to see Anna Paquin whose work I have loved since 1993. It is her talent I love, none of it given a chance in this disaster.Now 22 she is a robust beauty like Scarlet Johansson is, but without the unnecessary glamour component; and as contrasted with fragile beauties such as Nicole Kidman or Cate Blanchett.Why she selected this flick, dunno. I read she's a student at Columbia U. in NYC and maybe she wanted the trip to Spain. Who knows. It is often true that the artist in question is not a good judge of his or her work.I am pleased to read that she is a vegetarian."
1,Possibly the worst horror movie ever made,"I'm going to jump right to the facts, this movie is a mix of, THE RING, THE OTHERS, and THE SHINING. I would highly recommend that you DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE ! The only time you should even bother to see this movie is if they are handing out free movie rentals at blockbuster !"
2,DARKNESS TOOK OVER THE PLOT!,"In this weird, hard to understand film, a girl tries to find out history about the house that they just moved into. But learns that the past of the house had connections to her family tree and that a strange event occured to one of her family members.Now even though this movie was pretty dumb, while watching it, it still kept me thinking. It was kind of mysterious in a way which is why i gave it 2 instead of a 1 star. But horror fans, you will be disappointed."
2,DULL DARKNESS,"Filmed in 2002 but not released in the US until 2004, DARKNESS is a disappointing ghost story. While the movie is visually impressive with atmospheric and brooding tension, it does little to serve the muddled script and the acting is hysterically inept. For toppers, why and what is the DARKNESS? Why did seven people sacrifice their children for it? What were they trying to accomplish? And as talented as Giancarlo Giannini may be considered, why was he given the crux of the story's plot when he has such a thick accent that unless you turn on the subtitles, you have no idea what he's talking about. And the ending is so anticlimactic, you have to be a little ticked off you wasted your time with it. I keep hoping that the horror genre gets some new life in films that don't end up being so dull and lifeless as this one."
2,Failed potential,"What is wrong with the DARKNESS is that there is nothing to be afraid of. It seems that everybody on the screen is, but when we see what the reason is it ellicits more of a shrug than a shriek. This movie carefully builds up its premise with a spooky legend of a cult that sacrifices children that was unable to complete its ritual to ressurect an ancient demon. But when the story should climax with a hair raising finale it simply fades to darkness. Also the restrained lanquage in light of the horrific situations was laughable. A case of style over substance."
5,good buy,got this at a good price :) this a good horror movie if you didn't see it you should check it out.
1,Should of stayed shelved...,"I now see why this film sat on the shelf for two years before the studio finally decided to release it. It's ashame too, because they could of done so much more with it. Good actors, good cinematography, great setting and feel, but the script and dialogue made no sense whatsoever. Do yourself a favor and watch the Grudge instead."
3,it was ok,"i liked the special effects and the idea of the movie. the ghost or demons whatever they were in this movie were pretty creepy and smart. i didn't like any of the main actors in this except for the kid, grandpa and the crazy fellow who built the house. if they didn't have that paquin lady in this, it would have been better. oh yeah, and the scene where the father and son were stuck in traffic was just plain stupid."
3,Good idea; bad sound recording...,"I'm sure this film was scary. It was well acted and well presented. My problem was that I couldn't understand a lot of the dialogue that moved the plot along. The sound recording was weak, and doesn't come across on this dvd. It's always good to see the great Giancarlo Giannini, but his major scene was a little too contrived. Anna Paquin is fine, as is Lena Olin and Iain Glen. I don't know the name of the young son, but he was great. I hate bad kid actors; he was very fine. Also, Paquin's boyfriend gave the best performance of all. (The credits were so small on my screen I don't know the names.)The plot was simple, and I really wasn't that moved. I LOVE a good ghost story. This one was only so-so."
3,Worth a look see,"Okay, I did like this movie. Sure it's predictable, you know what's going to happen until the end. It was still a little different though. Now whether you'll like it or not really depends on whether you can take the ending, and the acting. That was my one problem with the movie, actually: The Acting. Most of the cast seemed more like high school stage actors than professional actors. Even Anna Paquin didn't do her best in this movie.The ending is kind of abrupt and remains somewhat open, but you still know what happens to the characters in the end. Luckily, and somewhat unfortunately, the script didn't allow for enough character development for you to become too fond of the characters before the end of the movie.Good mindless entertainment, don't analyze it as anything more though."
3,Not Enough Darkness...,"The main problem I have with DARKNESS is that it feels so incomplete, as though half of the story was left out. I love the blackened mood and overwhelming sense of doom and dread, it's just that it seems to lead up to a disappointing finalé. If more time had been spent on developing the history underlying the house, the cult, and their child victims, the strength and depth of the story would have carried the horror elements. Of course, the movie would have been longer by maybe 30-60 minutes, but it would have been a lot better for it. As it stands, DARKNESS is a half-baked film full of untapped potential that never quite terrifies. I wish people would stop trying to cram everything into 90 minutes, even when more time is absolutely necessary! AAAARGG!!..."
2,Great production values but no story....,"This is another case of a beautifully done film falling way below expectations because of a weak script. The cinematography, set design, lighting is all wonderful. The acting, such as the script allows, is also pretty good. The script however leaves much to be desired.There really isn't a plot other than the standard - House bad. House wants to eat you. House wins because of stupidity of actors. And the only time you have any sort of clue as to what is going on is when one of the actors gives a speech (thank you Mr. Exposition).If you really want to see the film, rent it once since that's more than enough times to see it."
3,Scary,"but it has a weak plot. It rehashes every horror movie ever made, like Amityville Horror and The Shining."
3,"An OK movie, but nothing really scary or special","Darkness is worth a watch if you buy it for cheap. I had the entire movie figured out after the father had his first ""breakdown"", and I am not the brightest when it comes to figuring out where things are going, so that doesn't bode well for this movie.The grandfather, the mom and the father all do fairly decent acting jobs, but i never bought anna, and i really have enjoyed her in other films.All in all, something decent to watch, nothing too graphic or gruesome if kids happened to see it...and nothing really scary if watching movies ruins your sleep=)"
2,Just wasn't impressed,"I'd have to say maybe back in the old days when this film was first released it could've passed as a decent horror film for me, but this film just seemed rather poorly put together for me."
3,Decent but Slow Nunsploitation,"Satanico Pandemonium (a/k/a El sexorcisto) is a very short (87 minutes) but satisfactory film. Shot in spanish, subtitled in english, there is very little dialogue and some critical scenes are hurried while other unimportant ones drag on and on.This flick has plenty of blood and nudity to temporarily satisfy gorehounds, but the special effects of 1974 simply weren't special. The acting is surprisingly fairly good and I wonder if the main character had roles in other obscure titles.While there is very little creativity and originality with regards to Horror coming out of Hollywood these days (read: bad re-makes aplenty), Satanico Pandemonium has enough solid potential to BEG for a GOOD remake!"
3,be careful,I apparently did not read the decription correctly because they do not have anything at top to keep them up. they fit my legs well and make them feel better. but I have had to buy a garter belt to keep them up
2,More bologna than Saucisse Minuit,"It comes as a surprise that Rex Stout, the master of dialogue and characterization, could have written this book. Simply put, Red Threads is dull. The writer tells us too much and shows us too little. The protagonist is little more than a bundle of mannerisms, lacking the spark of reality which enlivens Stout's more famous creations, Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe.I was disappointed, and I don't recommend this book."
1,Wait for Nero and Archie,Rex Stout hadn't hit his speed yet with this one.Even though he was one of my 2 favorite authors I see he had to learn the trade better to be one of the greats. Inshort - he hadn't met Nero Wolf and Archie yet.
2,You should look at the LA Times Book Review of this Book.,"Take a look at the LA Times Book Review review of this book, published Sunday September 28th 1997. It provides a comprehensive critique of everything that is wrong with this book at the same time as giving you a full synopsis of the story and the controversy."
2,"Disappointing, fits up to a SMALL 7 year old","As one other reviewer mentioned, the fabric is quite thin and unexpected for an apron. It is reminiscent of a thin table cloth or cheap cloth napkins. Also the size of this item is too small. It would fit my 5 year old for maybe a year or two, but definitely not my nine year old. I won't bother returning this due to the cost. If my five year old won't wear it I'll end up donating it."
3,More info please.,This apron is nicely made but I was surprised by the material's lack of heft. I expected something more than thin sheeting. Cotton Duck would have been the typical material used. Including a very nice chef's hat was a plus. I don't think the description mentioned that.
4,Perfect,Fits my wanna be 4 yr old chef. Made nicely looks like it will withstand many years of kid abuse
5,One of the finer things in life,"This collection is excellent. Eight classic movies, beautifully packaged and transferred carefully to DVD.One point to note - in fact, something I hadn't read anywhere else: With the exception of Manhattan, all the DVDs here are double-sided, containing both a standard and a widescreen version of the movie in question.The Manhattan DVD is one-sided, containing only the widescreen edition. I personally think this is no bad thing, as you lose a sense of panorama when you see a panned-and-scanned version. However, I know widescreen isn't for everyone."
3,Some good--some below par,"If you love Woody Allen, no matter what he does, then this set is for you. It is only partially for me. ""Annie Hall"" and ""Manhattan"" were great. No disappointment there. ""Bananas"" is an early Allen and I thought it was stupid, not funny. ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex"" with its many vignettes is bottom-line vulgar. I teach English in college, so you would think I might be attracted to the neurotic, endless soul-searching of the three daughters in ""Interiors."" I was merely bored. ""Love and Death"" is one of the better choices in this. The humor is much more mature. So, in the future, I plan to buy Allen only in singles. I loved ""Midnight in Paris,"" not a part of this set."
2,Intellectual Crap,"If I hadn't had to view this film for a course, I probably would have never watched it. I think Woody Allen movies are a love/hate thing, and I am on the ""hate"" end. The humor is pseudo-intellectual the way Woody Allen movies are known to be. There is also some ridiculous slap-stick humor, that I think may be attributed to the era it was filmed. The one memorable scene is at the beginning of the movie where Howard Cosell gives a play-by-play of the assassination of ""El Presidente"". Otherwise, this movie is good for one thing - discussing political humor for a university course. For pure entertainment purposes, I'd take a pass."
1,not able to run them in European dvd-s,"Totally disappointed!!!I love Woody Allen, love his filmsBUT - dvd-s are coded for US market and are not possible to be viewed on our European dvd -stotal waste of moneyyou should have warned me on thatBarbara Kalas, architect from Croatia"
5,Chris Williamson Changer and the Changed,"I've been giving ""The Changer and The Changed"" CD/cassette/LP to women friends for over 25 years and continue to do so. One of the best records ever made and certainly the best lesbian CD. Chris is the original pioneer of womens' music and this CD is a ""must have"" all these years later. Buying another one to give away today!"
2,Poorly Written!,"One of the ingredients of a good book is how well it is written. If it is in a confusing or illogical format or doesn't hold attention, there is no point in producing it. It is very clear that Sylvia didn't use a ghostwriter for this installment of her Journey of the Soul series. The writing is tedious, plodding, and lacks transitions and a consistent tone. I'm still slugging through the book, but it's not as easy as it has been in the past when Sylvia has used a professional writer to assist her. (Message to Sylvia) You're a lot of things: A talented psychic, a natural humorist. But Sylvia, you're no writer. If your regular one is busy, hire another. You owe your readers more than this delivers."
3,ok,In this third book of the Journey of the Soul series I feel that Sylvia got a little off track from the title. But still enjoyed the message. I throughly enjoyed the first two books of the series and gleaned much enlightening information and a new found understanding of myself. Overall I feel it was a Journey of MY Soul!!!
1,Deterioration and a disappointment....,"I have been following Sylvia's books and have read all of this series and others. This series has deteriorated, since the first wonderful Volume I. The book is disorganized; repetitive, rambles; and the familiar and soothing voice of Francine has changed dramatically. Much of it is blatant advertisement for ""her church"". Sylvia is pumping out books too fast and the readers are paying the price. There are MAJOR inconsistencies among the books and in this book particularly there are references to issues ""discussed in previous books"" that were never addressed in previous books. This is a very disappointing book and my marks for these books get lower and lower. I have to say that Volume I was an overwhelmingly wonderful experience in contrast to this volume."
2,Good acting but the story is too somber and gloomy.,"This 2002 film is set in an unnamed dark outpost in Borneo in 1924. The small group of Brits there run an ivory trading business. Into this outpost comes a young man and his fiancé, played by Janet McTeer. The fact that they are not married and she is quite a bit older than him is not lost on the small group which consists of a matriarchal woman who runs the business, her demented adult son and his aging and slightly crazy former nanny played by Olympia Dukakis. There's also a priest who seems to have spent too many years there and a criminal-type nephew who would like to run the business. The setting is dark and mysterious and the story is somber. There's cruelty, murder, insanity and suicide without one bit of lightness in the constant gloom. Yes, the acting is excellent and that is what made me keep watching, but it's such a dismal view of the world that there is no way I can recommend this film to anyone. See it at your own risk."
4,A goood film.,A very different kind of film.It shows what people will do for money.but great acting from the actors and actresses.Janet and Tony Maudsley and JJ Fielding great in there roles.
3,Extra carry space,Works very well for the stuff I don't want inside my car. Have a 3 wheel scooter I use to shop with and works well back on this.
5,This book is salt-of -the Earth great!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book; so much so that I bought the ""100 Edible Mushrooms"" also written by Michael Kuo. The photography is excellent, as is the description of the mushrooms. He writes with a sense of humor and avoids getting too technical. If you are lookng for a keyed identification guide, I would not recommend this title; there are many others more suited for that. But if you are looking for a fun, yet practical guide, this is a wonderful choice. The author understands the passion involved in finding morels......"
2,Not as promising at is looked,"I was really excited when I saw this book. I love the pictures, love the concept, but was disapointed in the product. I felt that often the bible verses chosen did not link well with the devotion. Several times there was a great concept in the devotion, and several bible references that could have easily been used, however the bible reference chosen did not seem to relate well at all. I currently reading my children ""The Jesus Storybook Bible"" by Sally Lloyd-Jones or the ""Big Picture Story Book Bible"" by David Helm over this devotion."
4,Circle Cutter,"If you need a big hole but lack large industrial tools, the G.T. circle cutter is a good tool for cutting circular holes in wood and thin metals (aluminum, copper sheet etc.). Good accessory tool for use with a drill press, but takes some expertise to safely cut round holes. I would not recommend the circle cutter for use with a hand-held drill."
4,Good hole saw for the price,"It is a good thing I read were it said only to use in a drill press. It worked well for cutting 1/4"" plywood."
3,"Hard to adjust, doesn't go deep","This tool did what it was supposed to and cut a hole but it was a lot of work to get that done. It is very difficult to set the width to a specific hole size. It needs some kind of scale etched on the tool or a stop to rest a ruler to set the width. I finally made test holes to get it set to correct width. It also doesn't go very deep. It did 3/4"" wood but probably wouldn't go much deeper. Maybe the center drill could be replaced with a longer one. The drill with the tool has a flat side for the set screw but it might work ok without that. I bought a similar drill that goes to 5"" width at Menards for $6.99 and says it can be used in a hand held electric drill."
5,A book for anyone who wants greater understanding,"Although ""Eyes of Desire"" is subtitled ""A Deaf Gay & Lesbian Reader"" it shouldn't be thought of as a book ""only"" for the deaf or homosexuals. This is a book for anyone who wants greater understanding, or just a good read. For me, it gave me some small insight on how ""they"" think and feel, gave faces and voices to people I hadn't thought much about, and reminded me that people have more similarities than differences.Some of the pieces are more oriented toward gay issues, some more toward those of the deaf/hearing impaired community, and some both. Some are more more explicit than others. Like any collection of works by various authors with pieces in a variety of styles, every work may not appeal to you equally, but all are worth the time."
1,wrong cd,"the person who is selling this item has the wrong title, she has the best of Rodgers and Hammersteinthe actual cd 101 strings sound of magnificence is currently unavailable"
3,OK,"I love Suzanne Forster's work, but this is not one of her best. It's just a little too predictible, and a few holes in the plot."
4,Heavenly!,"This book is surprisingly deceptive. You expect something light and instead end up with something deep and meaningful. Edwina Moody is finder. She's undergone a career change to support her mother and younger sister after her father disappears from their lives. Her current job is to find Chris Holt, who disappeared from home 20 years ago. If she can find him, the finders fee will allow her to save her family home from being foreclosed on. She enlists the help of a biker named Diablo to find Chris Holt, and is taken on the ride of her life."
3,Pony shoes,"Good for around the house, not much support but I dont plan on running a marathon in them."
5,Much better than keyspan,"This remote is the best one I have found on the market. I was using the keyspan for a while but honestly it is way overkill for what most presenters need in a remote. If for some reason I need to use the mouse I will go to the computer and use the mouse there... the little mouse button on the Keyspan is too slow to be efficient. This kensington has the right buttons, an amazingly great ergonomic design, and it just works when you plug it in. Definitely respect the fact that in this case less is more and go with this remote."
5,Great pointer,This device feels good in your hand and makes presenting very comfortable and easy. It is also stylish. It would be ideal if it were bluetooth instead.
4,"Great remote if you're using PowerPoint, Acrobat, or Keynote","This remote is extremely easy to use. It has four buttons, forward, back, laser, and blank the screen. The laser is bright enough, reception is excellent, and no setup is required on a PC, apple, or Fedora linux machine. My one complaint is that the remote sends the signals pageup and pagedown to move through slides. If your presentation program uses these keys then this remote will work for you. Otherwise it won't. My own experience is that it works for PowerPoint, Acrobat, and Keynote, but not Impress(OpenOffice) or Preview."
2,Does not work in Presentation View.,"Yeah, they claim this thing works with MS Powerpoint. But what they do not tell you is that it only works with PART of Powerpoint. It only works in Slide Mode. It does NOT work in Presentation View mode. Of course, most of my presentations are run in Presentation View mode.SO the remote is useless. And they have no fix for it. They cannot even document that this is the case.I am going to look for something else. Maybe the Microsoft Remote.***UPDATE***It's true, this presenter has problems with PowerPoint's Presenter View because in that mode PgUp and PgDown keys are used to scroll the notes. However, here's a neat trick I discovered that makes it work again:- Start the presentation in Presenter View- Pres ""B"" on your keyboard to show a blank screen- Click the mouse (anywhere in the blank screen) once to resume the presentation and then AGAIN to advance to the next slide- Magically, from this point on the presenter buttons work flawlessly."
4,Works like a charm!,"This presentation remote is exactly what I wanted. It plugged in with zero fuss, worked instantly, and navigated my slides with ease. My only complaint: the laser pointer is so underpowered as to be laughable. The $.75 laser I bought as a cat toy is brighter."
3,functional but crappy build quality,"First of all, this remote really works as many testified. Even on a computer that I don't have permission to install new hardware, it worked flawlessly despite the popped up warning messages.However, the built is really crappy. The battery cover is not shaped right, or somehow warped. The paper label on the back is about to fall. Also it's wide but light. I wouldn't mind if it's a little heavier.I would estimate the cost to make this thing is less than $1. Having this said, there's no regret in buying this remote at its current price."
4,Kensington Wireless Presentation Remote Control,"I am satisfied with the Product. However, I am extremely upset with the reseller, Tiger Direct. The purchased was shipped to an address I have not been associated or onsite for 5 years. It was LUCKY that the person who received the package was able to deliver it to me. Otherwise, I would never have received my purchase."
1,Maybe this is a good item but I never got the chance to see...,"I ordered this item and spent the extra money for rush shipping, as I wanted to use it for a lecture that was coming up. But the remote never arrived and I never received anything from the seller (GizmosForLife) about why this product was not shipped. So I emailed them several times and even left a phone message. Eventually (two weeks after I posted my rush order) I got an email excuse that was poor at best. The customer service for this company is a joke."
5,Perfect,"As a student I wasn't sure initially if the money I invested in this was going to be worthwhile. Having just given my first presentation using it, it was 100% worth it.I've plugged it into 6 or 7 computers at this point, it has worked on every one. Works with both Microsoft office and OpenOffice. I have not tried it on a Mac however.My class was doing presentations and everyone that I could talk into using this thing did very well with it, even with only a 5 second intro into how to use it. Two people in my class are looking to buy their own now.I hate public speaking and having something like this where I *know* it will work as it should makes it just a little bit easier. No fumbling or confusion, no fancy buttons you don't need, it has what you need and it works exactly as it is supposed to."
5,Like no other,"Two quick reasons why BTNH are exceptional at what they do:First, their rhythm tracks feature eclectic instruments rarely heard from rappers, such as flute and piano. Rhythms are highly original, rarely too repetitive, and multi-layered for a sensory experience unique to rap music.Second, the vocals feature notes--as in music notes. Each rapper has a distinct pitch and range; and the vocals are quick, crisp, and rhythmically complex as well as musical. Too often rap is just bad poetry set to a repetitive beat. BTNH are successful at creating music as well as gangster appeal.Multi-layered and eclectic rhythm tracks combined with clever (and not to mention very, very fast) musical vocals make Bone Thugs 'N Harmony the best rap group in history."
5,BONE THUGS N HARMONY COLLECTION V.1,I LOVE BONE THUGS N HARMONY AND I THINK THAT THEIR CD IS SOO COOL. IT IS THE BOMB BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL THEIR GREAT SONGS BONE THUGS ROCK!
4,Tha Collection,"I think this is a good CD, they extended some songs, they have the original mix of Crossroads, I actually think I like that version better than the version they have on E. 1999, and a couple previously unreleased tracks.I like it."
5,lovin it,i know this isnt a real bone thugs album...but more of a rare gems colletion..the original mix of crossroads is fantastic...take tha crossroads an make it depressing...POD is absolutely amazing...wowi still listen to 1st of tha month when i get my pay check..F**k tha police is a great remix of a great song..the only song i hate is war battlecry remix...its definately a skip...this is a good collection...go buy now!
4,Great Album,"This is a great album for all Bone Thugs n Harmony fans. However, if you want nothing, but new music from Bone Thugs n Harmony, this album is not for you. Most tracks in this album are old tracks. Even though most of the tracks are old, they're still great."
4,A Little of Everything,This CD is tight. Whoever put together this compilation layed it out real good. It all flows together nicely. It has mostly the Bone songs that are great to just sit and chill to or drive to. Tight CD for those rainy days. I would recommend buying this if you like the Bone songs that are best for just chillin.
4,"Pretty good CD, lotta good old bone favorites...","Lotta old hardcore hits and some rare stuff, like BNK with eazy e, and the bonus track P.O.D..... Great CD... If your a Bone fan, get out and get it, else you either slippin or just plain stupid.. :)"
3,Blast from the past,"CD was a gift for my husband. He likes it, I'm not so crazy about it. CD quality was as described from seller, but will stick to my music....."
5,addicting,"This album never ceases to bore me. Despite them doing song's with gimmicks like Akon now, atleast they had these memorable song's under their belt."
5,Cuts so smooth that almost no sanding is required,"I bought the Freud LU88R009 for use with a 1965 9"" Craftsman (Emerson Electric) Radial Arm Saw. I am rebuilding a deck and I need to cut lots of pressure treated 2x6s, 2x12s, and decking. I wanted a blade that would not cause chipping and that would allow me to butt the deck boards up against each other tightly to minimize visible seams and water intrusion. This blade cuts through the lumber like butter. The cuts are so smooth that you would barely need to sand them (in my case I don't need to sand them)."
3,I'm not sure how far to trust this book,"This book is quite intriguing, and the author's credentials certainly seem to be in order. However there are a few faults to the book which trouble me. There are a LOT of typographical errors -- so many that sometimes the instructions aren't clear. Sometimes words are weirdly out of order, or there are footnotes about ingredients which aren't included in the recipes above. Also, in terms of authenticity, there are errors. I am quite sure that a 14th century French sauce wouldn't have had tomatoes in it. The biographies of the women seem accurate, but they aren't written with any difference of personality. Also, although the recipes do look very interesting and yummy, many of them really require the reader to already understand a lot about cooking. The little inbtween steps which make recipes accessible for the novice are missing."
5,The definitive 280/300ZX guide,"This book has pride of place on my bedside table at the moment. Patiently waiting on the real thing (a 1990 Twin Turbo 300ZX to ship from Japan). It's the sort of book that an enthusiast can read and refer to time and time again.Mine was a second hand copy but virtually new condition. Brian Long does an excellent job on the history of Nissan/Datsun. And for 280ZX and 300ZX owners lots of interesting photos, period advertisements and background info."
2,Waste of Time and Money,"I received this as a Christmas gift at my request... after receiving it I tried to charge the battery to find that it wouldn't take a charge for more than 20-30 minutes at a time. Although the insturctions suggest leaving it on the dock for 2.5 hours. Also leaving it there when not in use...The power button is so small that it is difficult to turn on and off. I was able to use it successfully for one day, returned it to the dock for 28 hours and was not able to use it the following day. Very disappointed.I had received the package that included the printer which arrived with no instructions. I also received updated software for the first 3 days of ownership... making me wonder what could possibly have become out dated in such a short amount of time.Needless to say, I've sent it back for a full refund."
4,Good camera,"I thought that it was very well priced and well designed. I like the docking cratle, if it only had a lock on it, it would be nicer. I think if the camera came in alot of different colors, it would make the product more appealing to the younger crowd also:)"
3,good camera but,it's a good camera. the resolution of images is very good .but it's worst for taking pictures at night without light .
1,bad camera,this camera is horrible. the quality is horrible. the screen is small and the zoom is not very good
4,Great Value for the money,"I bought the camera as part of the christmas rush and got an excellent deal in the prorcess - camera + dock + 32MB card. The camera is very easy to use and the LCD screen is good(though a bit difficult to read in sunlight). the slideshow feature is cool and my family really enjoys watching the photographs on the TV with the included A/V cable. The connectivity to the PC is decent and quite fast through USB (although sometimes the software fails to find any photographs on the camera, but seems to work after reboot). Please buy the camera only with the dock as it comes with rechardgable batteries which are a necessity. the normal lithium ion AA cells don't last even for 10-15 photographs with the LCD preview on."
4,What you see is NOT what you get.,"Through the viewfinder, that is. It isn't aimed properly. It will take a while to figure out just how to aim it to get the subject layout that I want.Another gripe: for a camera that doesn't come with a case, they should have at least included a lens cover.The camera does take a little while to power on but that better than a camer that turns on accidentally and runs down batteries.The first time I put the batteries in, it was a little tricky. I managed to have some patience ... didn't want to force it and break it ... and I eventually got it to go in. Since then I've had no problems in this area.All in all it's an OK buy. If you tend to be techno-greedy or can afford it, buy something with at least 2Mpixels and 3x zoom but this camera is not bad for the price."
1,Bad customer care,"I purchased this camera and the battery pack wouldn't charge at all. Tech support told me to return the camera. Three weeks after contacting customer service through emails in an attempt to have the battery pack replaced, I was told to call customer service. I bought this camera for the dock that recharges the batteries. Now I have no battery pack and a dock I don't really need. It's no more convenient to use the dock than it is to hook the wire to the camera and only the battery pack is recharged by the dock. Regular rechargeables still need a separate charger. If you want this camera, skip the dock and just buy rechargeables and a charger. That's what I ended up doing anyway."
2,Oh my...,"I've had this camera for... 3 years now. It was great at first. My very first digital camera, and I'm glad it was this one. But, gosh.. if you look at this camera now from when it came out, it's complete crap!1.3 Megapixels? Come on, now the normal is at least 3. If your planning to use this camera now, look away. Though it is a great first digital camera, it is now was to outdated and crappy.Go ahead, and go for a 3 megapixel. Heck, go even farther and get a great 4 megapixel!"
1,Save your money for another camera,"Purchased earlier in year and returned in less than a week. I must say in theory the dock is a great idea, but they don't quite have it right yet. I found the battery life to be non- existent. The dock did not work properly. It would stay red as if to say it was still charging for over 24 hours. I returned and purchased an Olympus D-510 Zoom . It is great well worth the 50 extra bucks"
5,kodak 3215 dx camera and dock,"This gem is a dandy .... I never had a camera before so i was real green to this camera business. After getting it here on amazon and reading the book. It was easy to use, so the pics are great but i'm new too"
2,Get what you pay for.,"I had been looking for a digital camera for some time, and when I saw this camera/dock I thought the price was right. Even though the reviews were mixed, they were positive enough that I bought it. After turning on the camera, which took almost 30 seconds, I shot a few pics and quickly downloaded them into my computer. The dock was very easy to use, although I did have to install the software three times before XP accepted it (XP users must download new software from Kodak's website). The pics looked a little dark for day shots but still they were okay. That night I took some shots inside and I knew I was unhappy with the purchase. The pics came out extremely dark (even ones from close range). I tried again and got the same results. I don't know if I had a ""bad"" flash on the camera or if that is just the way it was, but I wasn't at all satisfied. I returned the camera and decided to spend a few more dollars on a better quality camera."
5,Lessons about animals,"This book tells the story of some valuable lessons that Annie learned about animals. One day, her cat started acting strange. Then it went away. Annie was lonely, so she tried to find herself another pet by attracting wild animals with corn cakes. Indeed, a veritable menagerie of wild animals was soon hanging around her door, including a moose, a wild cat, and a bear. But none of these animals were friendly like Annie&#65533;s cat, and soon the corn meal gave out so she couldn&#65533;t make any more corn cakes. Just then the cat appeared again, followed by some new kittens. Animal loving children may be fascinated with Annie&#65533;s tale, although some may be a little frightened by the press of wild animals at her door. The illustrations by Brett, as always are intricate and very attractive. The book has about 375 words."
5,My 6 year old daughter loves this book,"My daughter loves horses so I knew she would enjoy this book because it's about horses. She really enjoyed the story about Fritz and appreciates what a good pony Fritz was in the story. She is very lucky she has her own little ""Fritz"" pony to ride and the book made her appreciate her not-so-glamorous pony even more."
5,WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE ABOUT THIS LOVELY BOOK!,"A heartwarming story of a misfit pony who proves the proverb to be true: ""Beauty is only skin deep."" One falls in love with this dear little pony, his sorrows and his gentle ways. As the author describes him, ""Fritz was very gentle and kind. He was sure-footed and always willing to work."" His physical appearance of short legs and tangled mane did not win him an invitation to live with the other gorgeous horses in the beautiful walled city. He lived outside of it and alone.The text is perfect. The illustrations are unique in their intricacy. The author excels in variegated designs of the clothing of the characters, especially the children in the story.I won't give away the ending, but it is heart-winning and satisfying. Jan Brett has here created the perfect children's book, with love at its heart."
5,We love this book,We love this book about Fritz. The illustrations are beautiful. This is one of our favorites.
4,wonderful,"This is another beautiful book from Jan Brett. The only reason I did not give it a full five stars: the illustrations did not have the borders that Jan Brett is famous for trimming her illustrations with. Those border illustrations are so beautiful and missing from this book. Other than that, wonderful & beautiful book!"
3,Scary message?,The art work in this book is fabulous. But one of the messages - wild animals are very scary I am not sure I like. I bought it but will donate it to the library rather than giving to my 3-yr old granddaughter. She is being raised with a love and yes respect for all of nature's creatures and I think this went just a little too far for little ones.
3,Bored of Stupid Interviews,"Bored of the interviews given on the disc. I purchased it for the strippers. Just shut up and take your clothes off, no one cares what you have to say. Erica Campbell is so hot, she is the only reason for the 3 stars."
1,Senseless Acts of Violence Against Deer Provoke Anger.,"I was appalled at the horrific and cruel death of the mother deer in Bambi. I find it in poor taste to exploit poor, innocent, animals in this way. It is a disgrace to show these Hunter-oriented values to young children. People wonder why children think it's alright to be violent with classmates and friends. Well, I blame Walt Disney himself. It is no coincidence that all of his movies contain senseless acts of violence. It is the Disney corporation's plan to corrupt the minds of America's young people. I, for one, will not stand for it!"
5,My lovest book,"I like all the characters in this story but the dearest one is Bambi. When I was little, I asked my mom many times to read the story. Then when I grew up I read it by myself. But I liked it very much because the story is about a baby deer. It's very funny when Thumper thumped. The moment when Bambi met Faline was so touching! When Bambi and Faline were grown up it was their turn to have babies. I warmly recommend the other kids to read this sensitive book."
5,Thanks,It was in great shape.My nephew loved it. And it also was better than what I was expecting. Thanks a lot!
5,One of the funniest books I ever read.,"I found this book on my shelf while packing to move. I've saved it since the early 80s because at the time I first read it, it was one of THE funniest books I ever read and I remember laughing out loud reading it. I find it interesting to see that another reviewer finds it seriously outdated now and gave it a low rating for that...because there are lots of books that are ""period"" books. I mean, Dickens would be outdated now too, but he's still a great author. I'm not comparing this to Dickens, mind you, but while throwing stuff away for this move I also found a gob of those little necktie bows we wore in 1982 and spent a moment reminiscing...I may reread this for oldtimes sake -- those bows are even funnier now, I'd like to see how the book reads now too!"
2,Was probably better in the '80s.,"This book would probably have been better left in the '80s. Or prehaps it could now be read as historical fiction? The story revolves around Jill who was born a triplet. Her brother is a work-aholic with a ninny for a wife. Her sister is going crazy trying to be super woman. And every man she meets wants to sleep with her. Ok if you don't have anything else to read, but seriously out of date."
5,"""Puppy""","We love this toy! He's been with us everywhere. All over Europe, United States and Asia. I wanted to get a spare for us, and a couple more to give as a gift. My husband got this beagle w/ 2 other pups in 2007 for $5.99 so I'm shocked to find out he's priced @ almost $70! That's just too much. Not cool, seller!"
2,Reading Zero Just Isn't My Style,"I tried but I could not get into this cd. The musicianship is perfect and I like the music and production. But it is the vocal melodies and, in some ways, the vocalist that doesn't do much for me.I remain objective, though. I'm not as adventurous as other progressive metal/rock fans are. I do like the fact that Reading Zero avoids technical over-the-topness and focuses on songwriting. If you are into the more unusual aspects of prog, you will probably like Reading Zero's The Actual. As a previous reviewer stated, comparable bands MIGHT be Rush, Metallica, Fates Warning and Queensryche. I would add Megadeth (the vocals) and Damn the Machine (the music & vocal melodies) to that list."
5,A book of Narnians is a beautifull guide to the Chronicles.,"If you are planning to read The Chronicles of Narnia this book would be an excellent guide. It describes each of the enchanting characters such as Puddleglum, Aslan and the White Witch in detail to help you understand them more. It really brings what you read in the Chronicles... together, and with a map and timeline it really helps you to understand what Lewis is writing about. With beautiful illustrations and an enchanting text with quotes from Lewis himself, it is an excellent book even on it's own."
2,A book that should be left alone.,"A big downfall for this book is it takes so long before it has anything suspenseful. You can read the first half of the hole book and not want to read another page. It has no action scenes to speak witch would get your attention and give you some hope the book gets better. This truth to this is that it does not get better and there are no action scenes to be seen in the first half of the novel. There is some hope that there is some type of moral message or something that would educate you in this book but there is not. After your done reading this book it leaves you thinking ""What was the meaning of this story"". You may ponder that for a while then you will come up with a answer ""What not to look for in a book"". There is really no moral message to the story and you learn nothing."
3,"Get it, maybe...","The single is great, the B-side is one of S.P.O.C.Ks best tracks ever, BUT they also appear on the US version of Assingment Earth. So if you live in US get the album, for everybody else, this single is a MUST!It only gets 3/5 because of that all the tracks appear on Assingment Earth US editon."
4,As you would expect,Works well with our n scale layout. Holds firmly. With styrofoam and wood. Highly recommend. This product for your own layout or other hobby applications.
4,Very real,"This is a touching book... The stories are told with a clear, very real, voice. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for some perspective, hope, or insight into the joy and sorrow of life."
4,well made,good product. Ultrasonic works well for many years. But eventually not. This one is very good. Alternate methods actually heat the water to create a warm mist. I like this one for the size of the water tank and the convenient digital controls.
2,Small output. Small tank.,"This was my second humidifier from Amazon. This humidifier had an output smaller than the crane penguin, and a tank that was also smaller capacity then the crane one. There were white noise while it was operating, but the irregular gurgling noise was a lot less than the crane one. And the humidity sensor was a nice addition. However, the smaller output and higher price was a deal breaker for me."
3,A step backward,"I'd had a durable Toshiba ultrasonic dehumidifier for maybe 20 years, but it finally stopped, and it appears they're out of that business now. This unit has some more bells and whistles, but I'd still rather have the old Toshiba because this unit: has smaller tank capacity; instructions say I must disconnect the unit and move unit to a sink to pour out standing water in the base; and after every disconnect and refill, I must very slowly reset the humidity setting digit by digit back to my desired setting. On the other hand and relative to what's available now, it seems like a comparitively good deal so far after 2 months of use."
3,An ok humidifier,"I used this humidifier for about two months then it broke from me moving it while it was misting. It doesn't have a filter so algae and white stuff builds up inside the reservoir. I would consider another humidifier, preferably one with a filter. The night light on this model is a nice addition though and the humidity control + sensor seem to work ok with this model."
3,User manual is awful,"The user manual for this humidifier is very poor. Obviously written by a non-English speaker. It refers to buttons that don't exist, so that the user must decipher which button is being referenced by the particular instruction. Case in point, the user manual specifies a ""+"" or ""-"" button and they are actually ""up"" and ""down"". There are other similar mis-representations, leaving the user to translate the manual prior to being able to use it. Other than that, the product appears to work as advertised. It is larger than I thought it would be. There is also no mention in the write up that both the ionization feature and the night-light can be turned off. Someone mentioned that the ionization process hurt their dog's ears. Unless there was something wrong with the machine, that feature could have been turned off."
2,"functional, but not satisfactory","My spouse frequently has minor colds and sniffles and has been bugging me to buy a humidifier for some time. This last cold was the last straw, so I searched on amazon for a reasonably priced humidifier of reasonable quality. This one seemed to fit the bill.The fist night was fine, though I was concerned that the sensor never varied from reading a relative humidity of 61%. Even so, the unit humidified the room and my spouse commented that it seemed to help.The second night, my spouse said the unit had started emitting a high-pitched whine. I couldn't hear it, but that didn't matter.The person I bought the unit for was not satisfied, so I have decided to return the humidifier to amazon. I am replacing it with a highly rated humidifier from Lowe's. Hopefully I will have better luck with the new one!"
2,I'm a clean freak.,"It works perfectly fine, but it's impossible to clean in the tank. Literally impossible. I don't like to think about what it's spewing up into the air with the humidity. We ended up buying one of the Vicks 99% germ free warm air humidifier. Oh, and this is supposed to be super quiet. Not so much."
1,poor product,"The first unit delivered was defective - did not work at all - and was replaced. The replacement works somewhat. It makes water vapor, but the hygrometer control is nearly useless. If you stick the sensor into the vapor plume, the humidity readout will rise until the unit shuts off as it should. Otherwise, it seems stuck on 20% even when another hygrometer, itself of questionable accuracy, reads more than 50%. I could have purchased locally a unit without a hygrometer for much less. So the unit is at best disappointing."
1,"worked ok, for 2 months","This humidifierSPT SU-2081B Digital Ultrasonic Humidifier with Hygrostat Sensor, Blueis much smaller than I expected, but it worked OK, after I figured out how to program it since the directions don't match at all. The hygrostat was a waste because it ran the same regardless of the humidity level. However, two months after purchase it just stopped working completely, both the light and the fan stopped, despite the fact that I only used distilled water in it and followed all directions for care. Since it's more than 30 days old, I can't get a refund so I'm not at all impressed. I'll send it back to see if I can get at least a partial refund, but I don't think this was worth the expense. The last $25.00 one I bought at Walmart lasted 2 years and worked just as well."
1,Worked one night,"Although this machine would be perfect with the bells & whistles, small footpring and the right price, it only worked one night. Than none of the control buttons worked and it would not mist at all. Save your money and do more research."
1,don't waste your time,"down after turning on 3 times. It's good that I don't need to pay the shipping fee, but don't waste your time"
1,3rd one in 3 weeks,As a humidifier it works well but I'm on my 3rd one in as many weeks. The first one had a malfunction in the LCD screen and the 2nd one constantly shut on and off while it made a horrible growling noise. We'll see how #3 holds up. When its working it performs well but I am having doubts about the quality control. I'm sure it's another quality Chinese product. Amazon has been terrific to deal with.#3 had a defect as well. The indicated room temp stayed at 32 degrees no matter what the actual room temp. I tried blowing warm air over the sensing unit but it stayed at 32. I think I'll live with it because the reviews on the other humidifiers are not very good. At least this one does not leak and performs well.On 5-15 the third one failed. These things are junk.
2,Little Tikes Side-by-Side Kitchen,"So I got this for my kid who was turning two before her b day and as soon as I put it together she was playing with it and it was on top of her, this has no center of gravity and even with 25 lbs of sand inside it that I placed in side it still falls over easy and really should not be hold at all its poorly made and unsafe for any child. We couldn't return it because my kids damaged the box when we were opening it. And the seller I got it from on here has some policy so I just got stuck with it.[...]"
1,Some Soul To Keep,"This book is very depressing, I bought it two weeks ago and I am only on the first Chapter. I pick it up and put it down, because it is hard to read. I believe that black people came out of this state a very, very long time ago. Unlike ""Church Folk"" which was humoring and relaxing. I can't wait until the author writes another book. I have searched the book store often, hoping to find something else. I never had time before or thought I had time to read a book, however since reading Church Folk my reading has expanded greatly.Gladys Gravely"
4,Some Soul To Keep,"Some Soul to Keep is a great book to read. It has many true things that happen in life and people can learn about them. I liked this book because it's really in teresting and it has a lot of drama. This book also makes it easy for a person to understand how the author feels and is talking about. I rated this book a 4 becuase everyone can relate in a way to her stories and it's not boring at all. I got into the book fast and I think who ever read it will, too."
4,Great Read Aloud!,"This book is great to read to kids! It has suspense and it also shows kids how doing the right thing can seem bad, but soon you'll get something back. I liked the moral of the story and I like the way they illustarted it to look just like ancient Japan."
3,Good general purpose blade,"I have the TKR407 on a Dewalt 12"" double bevel compound sliding miter saw. The TKR407 is a good blade (better than the 60 tooth dewalt that came with the saw by a long shot) for general purpose work and mdf etc, however recently I have been using it for hemlock trim and the amount of tearout is too much for my liking, tearout seems to be less in harder woods such as oak and maple. If you are looking for a blade for finer work I suggest you look seriously at higher end blades instead, such as the Freud LU85 or Forrest chopmaster, they cost twice as much but perform better. I am a fan of Freud's blades in general, they may cost a little more than some, but I think they offer good value when you take into account that these blades last longer than the cheaper ones."
2,"Unsafe, smokes.","I'll give it 2 stars because the material is solid, however even at 620RPM while cutting through plywood the blades heats the wood and it smokes. The tool itself feels as if it could fly off at any moment. The distance markings are way off too. I'm returning this tool. Perhaps all such circle cutters are similar."
2,Heavy Duty Circle Cutter,"It works ok if the drill press speed is down to almost nothing. It's a dangerous tool if the workpiece is not securely clamped, and then, it works very slowly even on plywood. If there were hole cutters of 6 to 8 inch diameter I'd use them instead of this device."
4,fly cutter,"The product worked just like i needed it to. the measuring part was a bit off, but with careful measurements I was able to get it to close tolerances."
4,Circle or Wheel cutter,"Nice tool, but I thought that I was getting a wheel cutter and instead this is a ""hole"" cutter....it makes a difference whether the tip is on the outside of the cutting path or the inside"
1,Wrong Product Description,"The DY1054 is a ambient air temperature sensor used to detect the outside air temperature, not an engine coolant temperature sensor. This was verified at my local ford dealer."
5,Mixed-up Toby,"I am writing to inform you that my 3 year old son, Kevin, alerted me to the fact that he believes Lego Toby is not snapped together correctly in your photo; the number ""7"" needs to appear in the center of the tram engine. The rear piece is misplaced. Thank you! Does he get a prize??!!! Sincerely, Beth King and Kevin King (age 3)"
5,Informative & Fun,"I thought this would be a dry fashion book but these two women have written it, not only with humor, but with a true understanding of what a woman feels when she opens her closet each day. It fulfills a broad range of needs and satisfied everything (and more) that I wanted from it. And the great thing is that I can ask them questions on their website. This book gets my vote for understanding the needs of every woman who ever looks in a mirror."
1,Less content than most magazine articles,"I bought this book because of the positive reviews and was astonished when I received it. I pored over every page trying to find some useful nugget to make the purchase worthwhile, and couldn't find a thing. Poorly written, irritating and inane, save your money."
5,The Runners Bible,"This is spiritual food I take it with me when I fly, at sea at home lots of wisdom and well written for those not ready for Old and New Testament."
2,Boring,"How many cop shows does the 70s/early 80s need? And why are they all the same? I reviewed Starsky and Hutch and said it was terrible. It was. But this show was even worse. This one was laughable. Shatner's delivery of his lines was laugh out loud funny. And the boring story line. How about those strange people playing cops--that skinny dorky looking guy that played ""Romano"" was just so miscast. Not worth your time. Skip this one and go straight for Adam-12 if you want to watch a first rate cop show."
5,Excellent Sax work AND Excellent Horn Arrangement,"I have to rate this CD as Maceo's best to date. The first two songs will blow you away, and I have never heard horn arrangements like this from Maceo before. My favorite is Basic Funk 101, which should swap names with Advanced Funk because there is nothing 'basic' about the song. It has everything. Keep those sixteenth notes a comming."
2,Missing a key text,"I was very disappointed that Vickers decided to leave out NOVUM ORGANUM, one of Bacon's most important work, with one of the first descriptions of the scientific method, empirical science, and his key critique of the four ""idols."" Vickers says that he decided to give only the works in English, and NOVUM ORGANUM was written in Latin. There are translations available, however. The title of the book, THE MAJOR WORKS, is deceiving."
4,good book with thick notes,"The book arrived sooner than I expected. Although the delivery of amazon was as bad as before and the cover pages of book was broken by the turbulence of delivery as before, the first touch of the book still gives me comfort.the book begins with a long preface, and two pages of chronology. The content was about 2/3 of book, and the rest 1/3 was the note. I am familiar with author's name Bacon, and I have recited the essay 51, of study, but I never expected such a long note at the end of the book. It indeed need such a long list of note. The English author used was not modern and the grammar was strange, let alone the anecdotes and jargon.It is a good book, and it costs time to comprehend it, and it worth the time."
2,Ugh,"A few well-turned sentences and phrases do not rescue this effort. The heroine is a singularly unattractive character (only her children are worse) and it is difficult to imagine anyone falling for her. It is, however, terribly easy to understand why the pastor disappears after reading his last encounter with her; a protracted whine that belongs on an analyst's couch, not in fiction. The telling is better than the tale."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this novel when I read of its religious themes and satirical voice, and I was further excited by the Gogolian beginning. But, apart from a few laughs, the book is really nothing more than pointless fluff for bored, middle-class suburban housewives. The author could've done better."
3,where were all the great songs ?,"Im sorry but i was not feeling this tape. i was very disapointed that some of the better songs not get on the albulm, endless love w/luther vandross, anytime you need a friend, butterfly, breakdown. i mean come on sweetheart w/ jermaine dupri, didn't even make it to #1, at least not where i'm from, neither did i still believe. and how many times must i hear that damn ""hero"" song."
1,TOTAL CRAP,"Such an overated singer. Whitney totally killed the sl*t on WYB. The only reason why she came out with that pathetic excuse of a cd is because she was being outsold so badly by Celine Dion. Mariah's so scared to become the second biggest selling female artist of the 90's that she will come up with anything she can to keep her tiny sales lead over Celine. Celine outsings her and WILL outsell Mariah. Mariah looks more and more like a cheap prostitute. Thank God for classy, amazing Celine!"
1,please behave urself!,"the best thing for a real singer to do is to let fans focus on her music, but dress and news!!! so behave yourself 'cuz it's not sexy, instead, it's stupid!"
1,My first and last Mariah album,"I was really expecting more from Mariah. I actually got bored from this album and skipping through most of the tracks. I enjoyed songs like ""One Sweet Day"" and ""Hero"" but that's about it. I haven't listened to the CD since the day I first got it. Big waste of money. If you want quality buy a Celine Dion CD."
2,"pass on this one, too many misses, not enough hits","I love 99.99% of Mariah's music. Her rap selections I do not care for. It is too bad the songs I really, really love, are mixed with those I really dislike. If rap is not your choice, leave this one on the shelf."
3,"Hate Her, Like The Songs","I pretty much cant stand Mariah Carey (not enough clothing in my opinion),but unfortunatly I like her songs. As long as I dont have to see her face, or any other part of her for that matter, I can quite comfortably listen to this album. Its quite pleasurable to listen to infact. Always be my Baby and My All are great songs and Without You is still one of my all time favourites. I really dont approve of what ODB did to Fantasy, but then Mariah seems to have fallen in with that type of crowd, hasnt she?Anyway, I like the album but a thousand Number Ones from Mariah still wouldnt make me like her."
2,A useless christmas gift,"I got this cd as a Xmas gift from my friend who is a big Mariah fan. Some of the tracks are good, esp. the earlier stuff notably - ""Vision Of Love"". But the rest of the album sinks into homogenous balladry and soul-less r&b. Ballads are done better by celine. And R&B is most certainly done better by a host of other people. Overall,I found this album to be very disappointing - once you pop it in the cd player - it kinda seems like you're playing the same song a number of times - since they are quite similar. Nothing striking in this set at all. Skip it."
3,Good but not that good,"I knew Mariah had to put out a compilation cd, because she is losing sales over her Butterfly album.Overral the album is good, but the new tracks are rubbish, her singing is a let down these day and are not as good as music box or Emotions. Mariah is no longer that lady we saw in 1993.Now she is turning into dirty Madonna. I would not bother with new release in the future as her singing is no good. Sony should drop her contract."
1,BOOOOORING,This is a collection of what has been wrong with radio in the last couple years. It's a good laxative if you are constipated.
2,Over it,"First of all this is not a greatest hits album- it's an attempt for her to make twice the money on songs people have already heard. I got this cd for Sweetheart and was dissopointed that I got a watered down edited version instead of the much better version on Jermaine Dupri's album. As for the duet with Whitney on Prince of Egypt, it is much like the movie- overblown, overhyped, but sappy, and a washout in the end. If you listen to the words, it doesn't even make sense. And Whitney was singing much better than her, although she doesn't realize it. I think she needs to pay more attention to her music, and less about what she's wearing and movies. If you want to hear a good Mariah album, buy Butterfly and skip this."
2,Put a fork in her! She's done!!!,"When Mariah came out in 1990, I was hooked on ""Vision of Love"" and ""Love Takes Time."" I loved everything she did until she divorced her producer, turned slutty, and started doing songs with the help from Puffy and Bone Thugs. All you have to do is look at the cover of this album to see how in love with herself she is. The only fans she has now is the ones that are so brainwashed that they don't see originality when they see it. Whitney outsings her on ""When you Believe,"" by the way. Her voice just sounds so weak and airy compared to what it used to. I also thought some of my favorite songs were left off the cd because they never reached #1. I loved ""Without You"" and it's not on there. Well Mariah, I think you need to take a couple of years off and go back to what made you famous. Quit trying to sing R&B."
1,Bombed!,i didnt like the content of the c.d. i didnt care for the lyrics. her voice was harsh and hoarse. i didnt care for the arrangements either. arent these all old songs?
2,Not worth buying,"If you bought all of her previous albums, it is no need to buy this album. Only one of the new four tracks(I still belive) is good. Duet song with Whitney Houston was incredibly insipid as well as duet song with Brian Mcnight. After this album, she should take some rest and try to be more humble."
2,She Was Full Of Promise,"I can't say I liked this collection of Mariah's big #1 singles, although I do love her earlier work from her self-titled debut and ""Emotions."" After ""Music Box,"" around the mid-90's, Mariah's work became laughable, vanilla and unsoulful R&B filler."
3,It's pretty good,"This is pretty good, but I wouldn't say this is Mariah's best album. I agree with a lot of other people that Mariah should ditch the rappers! They ruin the song and I think the CD would be a whole lot better without them."
4,"#1s is good overall, but missing a few favorites","#1s is great for the ""fair weather"" Mariah Carey fan. Yes, there are the classics, but I would have further enjoyed the album if some other songs were a part of this compilation. Her song ""Forever,"" for example, would have been a good pick for this album. I also prefer the original ""Fantasy"" to the remix that's on the album. I hate to be critical of Mariah, because she is very talented, but she should have rethought this album's content."
5,Is there anything Mariah Carey can't do?,"Mariah Carey is my all-time favorite singer. This is one of her best albums. It's got some of her greatest songs ever, including Hero, Always Be My Baby, Vision of Love, Emotions, and countless others. Plus, there are great new tracks like Sweetheart with JD and I Still Believe. Any Mariah fan, music lover, or greatest hits collector should not be without this cd."
5,this is a very good album,"Mariah Carey returns with a new fabulous album. This album features Mariah's best selling singles of all time. Also, this album also features some brand new bonus tracks including When You Believe - a duet with Whitney Houston. This album is perfect for everyone not only Mariah's fans. You'll love this one."
4,Overall this is a great CD,"This CD is great because it has most of my favorites on there like ""I'll be there"" and ""My All"". The duet with Whitney Houston was great and so was her duet with Brian McKnight. The only thing I didn't like was the way she ripped apart ""Fantasy"". Mariah took a great song and just dubbed it with way too much rap. It didn't sound like a song at all! Other than that, though, if you want Mariah's best songs, this is definitely the CD to buy."
2,"""so-so""","I like a few of Mariah's songs, so I took a chance and bought the CD. To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed...many of the songs sound a lot alike, there's not much variety. Yes, Mariah does have a great voice, but she should get some more original material to truly make use of her abilities. By far, the best track is ""Hero"", a great song! ""Always be my baby"" and ""When you believe"" are pretty good, too, but after that, I'm at a loss for examples. Bottom line, if you're a fan of Mariah, you'll love it, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it too highly."
2,Didn't we hear this stuff already- why would I buy it again,"when your popularity is falling fast , the next best thing is to rehash all the old songs that were hits. Nice try but I ain't falling for it. I don't want to hear old songs that I heard a million times already. I already have those old albums - in the attic somewhere."
4,Mariah is one fire,I have never really like popular music until recently. She has more talent than other pop artists but sometimes she sticks to showing off less than an octave range on a song. I like the upbeat songs and ballads where she soars on the high notes. Being a singer myself I know noone that can sing that high. Probably an opera singer can but no other pop singer.
1,"Mariah rocks, really?",This album trully is ingenious--if you're still living back in 1991. Mariah has collected several catchy tunes... sadly though they all sound alike. These are Mariah's best for the nineties--and that's where they need to stay.
4,I like the songs but they're not the best....,"I like the songs but they're not the best because I think her voice is gettin' kind of old. She has a good voice but the songs just aren't cuttin' anymore. I know ""Honey"" is supposed to be hip-hop but I think it sounds more like pop to me only with Puffy rapping on it. Maybe if she went back to the way she was before when she made pop songs she would be really good again. That's why I like some of her older songs like ""Emotions"" and ""Dreamlover"" and ""Someday"". ""Sweetheart"" has a good beat to it and I still consider ""Honey"" an okay song. I also love ""Always Be My Baby"" and ""My All -Maria"
4,Great range of Mariah's hits!,"I bought this album when it first came out, and i only had the albums 'Butterfly' and 'Daydream', so for me this was a great album which inspired me to buy all of her earlier work. But if you already have all her albums you would probably find it a waste of money. There isn't anything really different apart from 'The theme from mahogany' which i think is only available on certain types. If you have all her albums only buy it if you're the kind of fanatic who would lose sleep over it."
2,Same old songs all over again,"If you have Mariah's other cd's, you might want to skip this one. The new material on it is mediocre and I hate to say it Mariah, but Whitney Houston out does you on ""When You Believe"". I think that Mariah has become more interested in a movie career and wearing short dresses than she is with her music. And it is beginning to show."
5,YAY! YAY! YAY!,"This is NOT a greatest hits album, as Mariah herself has said. A collection of her greatest and best hit songs (hence the title, #1's) and I find it very sweet to dedicate this album to her long and devoted fans. Every song (""Hero"", ""Dreamlover"", ""One Sweet Day"", ""Emotions"", etc.) is familiar and is comforting to hear them again and again. But what pulls the album together from being exactly what is was dreaded to be (the greatest hits LP) is the batch of fresh new songs, like the light ""Sweetheart"" and the ultamite ballad ""I Still Believe"". So I urge you to share the joy and buy the album and listen to it again and again. And that, my compadres, is the sweetest thing of all."
5,Someday,"the only thing that really bugs me about this album is that they didn't put the video version of ""someday"". instead the album version was put on ""#1's"". the video version has never been released on any of her albums or singles on anything else. they did release ""someday"" on the home video ""the first vision"" but it was an extended version. it's driving me nuts that you can't get it on a c.d."
5,Lisamarie do you like Mariah Carey?,LIsamarie how are you i found out how to do e mail sorry I can not come to your birthday party maybe i will see you in a little while.Until i see you bye.
4,good,"I was going to give this 5 stars but then I stopped to think... where did the original Fantasy mix go? ODB's is ok but the original is much better. Also adding to my 4-star review was the fact that that song with Jeramine Dupri was boring. But why I gave this 4 stars? Because ""One Sweet Day"" is the most touching and truthful song I have ever heard. This CD is worth all the money."
5,"Excellent, that's all I have to say......","For all the jealous boys and girls who have been disrespecting the name of Mariah Carey: The only thing I'm going to say to you is that she's better than you, more beautiful than you and hell yes she sings 100x better than you!!!!!!! MARIAH YOU'RE THE BEST"
2,Marginal,"Jeez, you guys, this wasn't that much work for Mariah. She just took a bunch of old songs which everyone who's been alive for more than 13 years has heard of and put them on one CD. Add a few blurry snapshots and voila. A couple million."
1,TIRED,"Mariah should just give it up. This album, as all of her work excepting the _Butterfly_ album, is tired. Come on, Mariah, instead of reliving the schmaltz that most of your songs are, how about putting out more jams like ""Breakdown,"" ""The Roof,"" and ""Honey"" (which is luckily included on here)."
1,Sounds like a wailing sick bird,The problem with Mariah is that she does not know the meaning of restraint! It's impossible to find any non-vocal parts in any of her songs because she fills all interludes with screams and wails. I am so over her - she is more interested in showing off her legs than making good music.
3,So-so,"I used to really like Mariah's stuff. Her older albums were pretty good. But I do not like her newer songs at all. She does have a good voice, there is no denying that, but she has gone too hip-hoppy and oh so [bad]....those clothes, my God! Is she trying to sell her body or her music? Not the latter, me thinks! There are a few good songs on this album, but once 1995 has been covered, then they stop and become so monotonous. Stick with her older albums and give this and her post '95 albums a miss."
2,Not #1,"Mariah Carey does have reason for a hit's album. I mean she has had many hit singles. All singles in this CD are good, but by the way she sets it up its like listening to the same song over and over again. It would be better if Mariah mixed up the songs on #1's but instead you have to listen to the transition in her voice backwords. Definetly not #1."
1,Who signed Mariah Carey to a recording contract?,"Did anyone else besides me notice that she can't sing? Her voice is pure cacophony and agony for the ears. The songs are all about love and sound exactly alike. People go on and on about how Mariah writes her own songs...so what? They are absolutely awful! To be honest, I don't listen to much adult contemporary music, but Mariah's voice is untrained and off-key much of the time. She always feels the need to screech in a lot of her songs, which only makes it worse. I would highly recommend any Mariah Carey album...that is, if migraines and splitting headaches sound like fun to you. If you don't, then quit buying her albums so her record company drops her!"
5,More than just #1's,An absolute unequalled collection of deserved chart toppers which covers a span of 6 albums. All of the songs on this album are beautifully crafted gems which will stand the test of time and shine on for years to come.This album is more than just a collection of #1's. It is a soundtrack to the 90's!
1,bland,"I can't deny Mariah Carey has a wonderful voice, it's just a shame she doesn't put it to better use. Clearly designed to succeed commercially rather than have any artistic value, ""#1's"" is boring, and has an incredibly smug title to top it all off. Of the so-called ""divas,"" Mariah Carey's certainly got the attitude, but she lacks the musical talent of her peers."
4,It's great stuff,"Too bad you Americans won't be getting the cover version of ""Do you know where you're going to""- it's available on the asian release. Overall, the album has a few new songs, and duets and the old #1 hits (notably the cool ""Fantasy remix.)I think it's great value for money especially for Carey fans. For casual listeners, there's nothing more golden than the voice of this truly talented singer (who also writes her deeply personal songs- starting from Butterfly)"
5,Listen to the lyrics...,"When I first heard that this C.D. was coming out, I was really excited because I love her songs. My favorates are ""Always be my baby"" ""Whenever you call"" ""One sweet day"" they all have great words and when you are in a singing mood it's a great C.D. to put on. GET THIS C.D.!"
5,Mariah is great,"This album is terrific, all her number 1 songs in one album, a truly worth buying compilation, her voice is still as great, and we can actually see her maturing throughout each songs, all her number 1 songs r worth a listen and this album is so wonderful that i recommend to everyone! the best buy this season"
5,Best of?,"This is not a best of, a Carey states herself. But the songs did not all go to number one by accident, now did they? I agree that some of Carey's best songs were the ones that were never even singles, but if you want a collection of great songs that made it big on radio, can it be better than this? And there are some real good stuff in among the bonus-track as well. Johanna"
3,I don't know if I like it or not.,"Mariah Carey has a beautiful voice, but personality matters, also. Sometimes fame can go to your head. We've heard enough, Mariah. I think it's time to stop."
5,The perfect gift - for anyone and everyone!!,"The album of a lifetime! Pop diva Mariah Carey has out done herself! This compilation of her 13 #1 singles, with 4 new songs is an extrordinary look at her incredible 8 year career. With all the great songs like 'Vision of Love', 'One Sweet Day', 'Emotions', 'I'll be there', and much, much more! The album also hold 4 new tracks. 3 of which are duets. There is 'Sweetheart' with Jermaine Dupri. There is 'When you believe', a powerful ballad with Whitney Houston. And there is the song 'Whenever you call' with Brian McKnight. The other song is a remake of Brenda K. Starr's hit 'I still Believe', which in my opinion is one of the major highlights on this album.This the perfect gift for any music lover. DO NOT LET IT SLIP THROUGH YOUR FINGERS!!!Ryan Barrowman"
3,a great voice in premature decline,"ten number one's in less than ten years is quite an impressive feat in an industry of shifting trends and loyalties.unfortunately, this album also shows how a great voice like hers,this early in her career,is already in decline.just listen to ""emotions"" and ""i still believe"" - the difference is as stark as night and day."
4,why not call it mariah's greatest hits?,if you're a mariah fan and wanna hear her number 1 hits like someday this is right up youyr alley.
4,This compilation of her #1 songs is worthy...,"After almost a decade of performing to the world, it's about time to put out an album like this! One remark though, in ""I Still Believe"" (off her latest), her faint and cracking voice is highly noticeable even in her songs from the previous CD, Butterfly. It seems as if she's not taking care of her once-mighty voice. Also, at her concert this past year in Hawaii, she had to lip-synch a few of her songs (i.e., Emotions). It was evident that she could no longer hit those high-pitched notes that were heard in her earlier songs. What's happening, Mariah?"
2,Why should a person buy this cd?,"mariah, mariah what can i say to your fans? All I can say is skip this album unless you want to buy the same songs that you already own. The new songs on this album are a complete waste of engergy, time, and viewing power of the listener. Mariah did not put much time or effort into these songs and it clearly shows to everyone listening. Next time Mariah put more thought into an album before you release it and give your fans more to look forward to in the future."
4,"This CD was a great idea, and it has a great mix of songs","This album was a great idea! Because she has SO many songs out, you really get the ""cream of the crop"" in this album. There are some of her old songs, and some of her classics, like ""Honey"" and ""Butterfly"". My favorite by far was ""My All"", and yes that too is on there. She even has some bonus songs. . . .soon to be number ones??"
2,Only thing good about this is the cover,"The cover is very nice but the songs aren't good. I got this for a birthday present and I only like two songs, the first two: ""Sweetheart"" and ""When You Believe."" The latter dosen't belong in this CD anyway cos it's so rhythmical and grand..something Carey is not. And I'm sick of all the humming when every song starts -R&B wannabe. Sick of the extremely high pitched screams/shreeks too. Again, I liked the cover..."
2,"same old, same old","look some of these songs are okay, but man this is the 90's! People are into korn, jay-z, foxy bronw, ect.! ""Breakdown"" is cool but ""My all"" is too sappy for me! She needs to put more rythm into it and more beat. and it might be nice if she would sing every once in awhile instead of having her backup singers do it for her!!!!!!!"
1,Mariah Carey is no diva,"oh, excuse me...i didn't bother buying this album but i thought i'd put my two cents in. mariah looked slutty on her cover and she HAS gained weight. come on, did you see her at the oscars? she looked so fat, i wonder how she fit into her dress. the dress was in poor taste too. mariah sold out when she came out with butterfly and started passing herself off as R&B. whatever. and people say she's a role model...do us a favor, mariah, and try singing, not screaming. and put some clothes on, you don't have much to show for it. and please don't dis other singers like celine dion to make yourself look better...it just makes you look bad."
1,Very disappointed,"Look I like Mariah Carey but really what is she doing. I only liked two songs out of the whole tape. The two songs are Fantasy and Dreamlover. I hate Emotions, My All is ok, Whenever You Call sux. I'll tell u y I only like those songs. It's b-cuz they have a catchy tune to them."
1,WHAT A JOKE!,I'm very tired of mariah carey. she is completely unoriginal and her songs are so boring. By the time she reaches 40 she won't be around i guarantee it. the only reason people like her is because she wears as little clothes as possible in her music videos. she's not a real musician.
5,She is my hero!,"I love this CD most of all because her songs touch my heart like no one else can do. I especially like her duets with Brian McKnight and Whitney Houston. ""Whenever You Call"" makes me cry every time! Even though ""Butterfly"" never hit #1, she should have added it to her spectacular collection because it is a heart-warming song and deserves to be #1!!! Thank you, Mariah for touching my heart the way you did!"
2,at best this cd is mediocre,"there was nothing to really move me on this cd. The overall quality was not on par with what i hear coming from other musical artists like celine dion,the content on this cd. was not up to par either , neither lyricaly nor musically, mariah should take a much implied rest ,rather indefinitely"
4,Not the smartest thing to do,"Mariah Carey is very talented in alot of ways, but ""# 1's"" isn't the best thing she's ever done. I personally like her songs that didn't go to number one better than the ones that did. For example ""Emotions"" is not a number one sounding song although it is on ""# 1's"", and "" Anytime you need a friend"" sonds like a number one smash hit. I guess it's all in the timing in which she released the songs as singles. The first single on every album has landed in the number one spot, while the fifth single makes only the top ten. Probably because whoever wanted the record already had it. What she should have done is waited a couple of years and released a greatest hits album with all her comercial and non comercial songs on it. That would have made the perfect combination of songs. I have to give her credit for adding the four bonus songs though, they really make the album worth buying."
2,at best the cd was mediocre,"it wasnt a big leap from what we're accustomed to hearing. I personnaly wouldnt invest in the cd, cause its at best, fair to average. I felt let down or disappointed, no big whoop here"
4,Christmas present,this also was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she was very surprised and happy
5,WHAT!!!!!,am i looking at the price right.almost 3 hundred dollars for this cd.yeah right.i won't pay that much for one cd.
1,This is her best?,"What a horrible bunch of crap this is. I bought it because I wanted to see what I was missing. I'm generally a fan of female vocalist, but this material is trite, saccarin, and uninspired. This is music for people who don't want to (or can't) think about their music too much. In the same vein as Streisand, Houston, Deion, etc. There's 50 girls at every high school that could sing this stuff."
5,5 stars are not enough!,Five stars plus five stars might be enough to describe this 1's CD. Someone let me borrow this one a couple of years ago and I went straight out and got my own. I also bought and gave a couple of these away as gifts. This one is definetly a keeper and a giver if you know what I mean. I love every song the slow ones and the spunky ones too. I once told someone that this would be one of those I take if I was stranded on a deserted island.
2,Uninspired,"Ho hum. Although there are a couple of cuts I appreciate, there are WAY too many hip hop numbers for my tastes. Have you ever heard her sing ""Jesus, Oh What A Wonderful Child"" from her Merry Christmas album? With that kind of voice and talent, why waste it on relatively ""melodyless"" hip hop? I don't dislike hip hop, but when I think of Mariah Carey, I think of sweeping vocals. The four included ""bonus"" tracks were no bonus. I would have preferred some of her #2 hits instead. If you love Mariah Carey, you'll excuse this album. However, if you REALLY love her voice, the ""Merry Christmas"" album is a far better choice (besides being inspirational)."
1,Worthless,"Yes, she can sing, and yes, she's been successful. However, it does not hide the fact that she is quite possibly the most worthless popular entertainer today. She'd even give Cher a run for her money. The songs are glib, over-produced tripe. As Bill Hick's would have said, ""ball-less, soul-less, spirit-less"". Hellish."
1,Lame commercial pop crap,"Here's the recipe for success: Wear tons of makeup, dress in skimpy outfits, come on to the president of Sony, have sex with him several times a day, and voila - you're an instant star! Of course Mariah Carey had to screw her way to the top, because she can't sing, she can't write, and all her songs sound exactly alike. The only thing there is to like about her is that she is living proof that there are ways to become successful in the entertainment industry while having no talent at all. Slap yourselves for buying either this or any other Mariah Carey album."
5,The Un-diva.,"My girl Mariah has gotten a bad rap ever since she broke from her svengali husband and ever since she did that VH-1 ""Divas Live"" show, in which two of the ladies were obviously hogging the show and the stage--hint: one of these two was not Mariah.(Guilt by association? Who knows?) In fact, Mariah has been the most un-diva like, in my opinion. She's with us, not above us, dig? She acts as if she is geniunely suprised to be where she is and she always gives her fans their props. So when she says this collection is for her fans, I believe her. Although she coulda sneaked on my favorite, ""Breakdown"", this is as complete as it could be with them wall-ta-wall hits. Mariah also seems like a person you can have a fun time with on a date, she is that real. So, all you one star reviewers, stop stressing the girl and let her bask in her well deserved spotlight...this is the best from one of the best singers, one of the best celebrities out there now."
5,A Must For a Fan Of Music,I believe Mariah is someone that everyone should listen to. This CD I think shows her talent very well.
4,"Four stars for the old songs, 1 for ""When You Believe""","The old songs on this album are really good, like ""Hero"", ""Someday"" and ""Vision Of Love"". They ruined ""Fantasy"", however. The original is much better. The duet with Whitney is good because Whitney is on it. ""Sweetheart"" is not that good, and ""Whenever You Call"" is better as a solo number. ""ISB"" is a showcase of how Mariah's voice is going. Old songs are good, new ones aren't!"
1,GARBAGE(WHICH IS WHERE IT BELONGS),wHAT KIND OF ARROGANT SHALLOW UNTALENTED BROAD WOULD BE SUCH AN ARROGANT IDIOT AS TO BRAG ABOUT NUMBER ONE SONGS. Mariah has done just that. She is the worst singer in the history of this planet. The album is boring and undanceable. If you purchuse this album buy a hammer to break it with later.
2,Mariah-How about singing other people's songs?,"Mariah Carey-great voice but after listening to these songs, many of them seem to run together and sound the same. Also, her constant leaps into the upper reaches of the vocal stratosphere tend to get annoying. Less vocal gymnastics would defintely help many of these songs. And finally, what an annoying cover for the CD. Please, have some taste! My suggestion to Mariah going forward--how about trying to interpret other writers songs? Take a lesson from Linda Ronstadt, Mariah--listen to her ""Cry like the rainstorm, howl like the wind"" CD. Linda doesn't write her own songs but knows how to pick good material from a wide variety of writers both old and new."
3,Excellent Compilation But Trite,"Mariah's vocal talents are well showcased on this album, however we have all heard these songs before. I got it because liked all the ""#1s"" and wanted to have them on one CD. What I didn't know was that the songs would get trite after only two weeks in CD player. Most CDs last atleast 6 weeks in my player. I can only stand to listen to her music one song at a time...however, Mariah is an execellent singer and songwriter. She deserves much more credit thn is given. Also, she may have married a record company executive but she didn't marry success. mariah worked hard to get where she is and no marriage could've done what hard work did for her. As for her fashion choices...they're irrelevant. We're living in the 90s. Women don't need to be so defensive anymore, we can be sexy, talented, and intelligent."
1,I do not like this CD.,"I don't know how you all got hooked on Mariah Carey, but did you see her dress on the cover of her #1's? Her songs are not good, she barely sings at all in her songs. She just makes a high throaty voice. I used to like Mariah Carey, but now I think that I was foolish to think that hse had an incredible voice........"
2,2003 old data and thinking.,"Although the general conclusions are often right, the data is now old, and old solutions are no longer valid. Ways of thought that are invalid are still prevalent, like Mason's thinking that it is a direct link between poverty and over-breeding, when in reality it is intelligence. It is already too late for many solutions to ever work, because immediate 2003 steps had to be taken and were not.The arctic has heated up enough that by 2009 it was reported at the tipping point for methane self-release, for example.I had erroneously thought that the book was new, and wish I had not bought it. Too much has changed to make the book really of much use."
3,"Cute, but too small","I got this for my 2 & 1/2 year old daughter so we could start a Sweet Streets collection. She loves the little dolls, but can barely put them inside this store because it doesn't open wide enough. I plan to buy the Victorian home or the hospital for Christmas because at least they open wide enough for dolls to fit inside. I would not recommend this piece, however."
2,Long winded and outdated,"As a student, the book was okay at best. There are many real world stories and cases but they are outdated. The book references the sources of these real world examples on the same textbook page as the story itself so it is easy to notice how old some of the information is. Some date to the late 90's, and even though the publishers added some newer information to the stories and referenced the updated information, the update may also be a number of years old. The chapters are long winded as well. It made for long and tedious reading."
3,Hard to use in studying,"This book was in my opinion really hard to use for class. It has tons of text that is overwhelming and not broken up very clearly. Every time we had a list of terms to look over it was really hard to first of all find them in the book and then to grasp the true meaning of them because nothing was bolded. It had good information and nice case studies, I just wish it would have given more focus to the fact that as a textbook it is meant to be studied and it was studying was very difficult to do with this book."
4,Textbook,"International MarketingThis was a book I needed for class. What can I say, it was required."
2,"a good coverage, but...","I used his book as an MBA student 15 or so years ago. Now as an adjunct professor, I am using this newest edition in my undergraduate classes. Although my observation may be biased, the book is a bit too encyclopedic, a bit superficial in coverage, and fails to excite the students. I wish it were more up-to-date."
2,"Wordy, poorly organized, requires significant supplements","I used this book in an MBA International Marketing course. The text is a very cumbersome read. While the book contains adequate anecdotal information, the information is poorly organized and often fails to engage the reader. I routinely found myself searching for more concise supplemental materials for concepts the book failed to develop. The narratives are extremely wordy and consistently obfuscate salient points. If I were using the book as an instructor, I would use the country notebook section as a course guide and scrap the rest."
3,Knowledgeable authors-boring writing,I took an International Business class for my MBA. I read every chapter in this book. There was a lot of knowledge included but there is often too much wordy writing and the book drones on. The definitions need to be in the margins. The last chapters are more of a cross cultural study of doing business with Japanese. It was a boring read-but good before bedtime for those that do not fall asleep easily.
3,unusual knitting stitches and projects,"This book is a bit dated, and the styles are somewhat old-fashioned looking, but the unusual stitches that are described are great. That is why I bought the book, and I want to use those stitches in another way, such as a scarf. It does not describe any of the modern yarns very much and is not really the best book if you like to use fun, colorful, textured yarns. If so, find another book. In my opinion, this is for relatively plain yarn kintted up with a very textured appearance."
2,now what I'd hoped/expected,"Somehow from the title I'd expected some good ways to use up one's huge collection of different wonderful yarns. Instead, I didn't like much any of the sweaters, and they seemed to be pretty yarn-specific. If you want to use up lots of odds and ends, try Kaffee Fassett."
4,I thought this would be a good memoir..,"I found this memoir in one of my favorite bookstores and thought it would be good. The copy I found was very creased in the spine and the jacket looked worn as well. Inside I found pink highlighting, blue ink underlining and some handwritten notes in the margins. I thought the cover looked interesting..covers can (sometimes) tell you a lot about the book..and in this case that is very true. The author, Louise, captured my interest in the author Virginia Wolff--so that author goes on my list of authors and books to read. As memoirs are so good at doing I have gotten another whole set of books to read from reading just this one memoir. Memoirs have a way of doing that. :)"
1,Does Not Last Very Long,"I am posting this review after about 5 months. I used this battery in a Panasonic TGA271. All I can say is that it simply does not last and no longer holds charge for more than 5 minutes. I have second handset where the battery is still good after 2 years. I will not buy this again. Cut me off unexpectedly last week, so it died quickly."
1,Cheap batteries,"These batteries are unbelievably cheap. I purchased three of these to use in my cordless phones. Very cheap, thin plastic. They didn't even come with the labels attached like in the product picture. The seams on 2 of the 3 batteries has already started to split open after 2 months use. One battery shorts out from time to time and continually causes my phone to cycle on and off. They barely last two to three hours when the phone is not being used and just in stand-by mode. I learned a lesson: You get what you pay for. I've since ordered the more expensive brand name batteries to replace these. Buyer beware!"
3,Almost a battery,"Hitech has undoubtedly packaged an off brand Chinese ""equivalent"" set of cells for these Panasonic replacements as the behavior is rather inferior to the originals, bot in terms of longevity of charge and rebound time charging from dead."
5,So far so good..,Going on two months now without a flaw. Batteries stay fully charged and bring new life to old phones. Recommeded
1,Fake battery,The name says: PANASONIC HHR-P103 NiMH 700mAh.But it is actually a no name brand battery. It does not even have the name of a manufacturer or any sort of contact information. You have no way of tracing back to any source. Some people are selling this using Panasonic name. Fake stuff.
2,Short-Life Batteries,"These were cheap in cost but unfortunately they were also CHEAP in substance too! They simply DO NOT hold a charge for long or even at all for one of the batteries I got. So DO NOT buy these at all. Look elsewhere if you're wise, indeed."
2,not recommended,I purchased this microwave 6 months ago. It is a very large powerful unit that takes up alot of space on your counter top. Also if you are used to the 1100 watt microwaves you will fry everything to a crisp the first 2 months or so. In 6 months this thing just went poof and burnt out like it blew a fuse. It costs so much money to send back in for warranty work I will use it as a doorstop. Keep shopping.
2,Not very durable,Worked for a few months and then burnt out. Will be going with another manufacturer for our next microwave.
4,Good movie.,"Funny movie! Jason Biggs and Dane Cook have a good chemistry and Kate Hudson is pretty funny in it too. I wasn't knocked out, but I'm glad it's in my collection."
5,Dane cook being funny again!!,Funny movie worthseeing. Dane Cook beinga crack up again with agood storyline.
5,Very funny,"I watched this over and over again. If you don't like movies like 'wedding crashers' don't bother, otherwise you'll probably love it too :)"
4,These actors together are too funny!,"I don't understand why this film got a 1/5 star review. It is a crude comedy with a love story twist. I laughed the entire time. I love Dane, Kate, and Jason. (Not a movie to watch with your kid's!)"
5,Great,"Saw this on the internet. Loved it. Clever, original plot. Just ordered a copy for myself. Probably not for the Sound of Music crowd, unless they also liked S.O.B.."
1,Crude and demeaning.,"Wow. Didn't make it much past when Kate Hudson and Dane Cook's characters meet. Kept hoping the movie would somehow redeem itself from being crude and offensive and demeaning to women, but gave up. If this movie were as negative and stereotyping toward men as it is toward women, I wouldn't like it, either."
1,Please erase this movie from my memory bank!,"I've never met a bunch of more worthless characters. Even if a story is about a serial killer or bums or drug addicts, the good writer will get you to side with the leads in the movie. I couldn't care less about ANYONE in this slow moving waste of time and money.If someone were to offer to PAY ME to watch these creeps, I would turn the person down. A rating of 1 is too high..."
4,"Dane Cook's Best Role Yet, ""Hitch"" In Reverse!","I didn't think Dane Cook could top ""Good Luck Chuck,"" but I was wrong. This movie, he is an a-hole to give women dates of pure hell in order to make them realize that they made a huge mistake to leave their boyfriends, let alone date Cook. The points for me were the counting, or countdown of the worst moments of the date, especially the wedding scene. I say to you, if you like a-holes, or if this makes you think of a close friend or co-worker, get this movie!"
3,Sweet but ...,"Unfortunately, the sweet little plot of this movie was lost in the constant explicit language and some of the ""over the top"" displays by Cane's character to prove he was bad boyfriend material. I am not easily offended by language but I do think the overuse of particular words and gestures will limit the appeal to certain audiences. There is; however, a sweet little love story in there but likely only those who can get past the language will be able to find it. Scan and preview before you invite someone over to watch it with you ..."
4,Good Ol' Raunchy Movie,"If you like Dane Cook, you will like this movie. It won't win any awards, the plot isn't all that great, but we really enjoyed the film.This movie is very raunchy so it's probably best to watch with some drinking buddies, not with your family.MILD SPOILERS WARNINGThe only thing I didn't like was how it ended. I just don't buy that anyone would do all the stuff Dane's character did at the wedding. It doesn't spoil the movie, however."
3,Could have been good but FAILED,"I love funny sweet chick lit movies and I was hoping that this would be another gem. Unfortunately, I was to be disappointed with this movie. I feel asleep for about 20 minutes during this movie, but managed to stay awake to watch another movie after this one so that gives you a clue as to how good it was.I love Jason Biggs, think Kate Hudson is good but I don't think I'm a huge fan of Dane Cook. None of the films I have seen him in seem to be very funny or good.Wait to rent this at the $1 movie places."
1,"If you like vulgar and juvenile, get this movie","I saw the tail end of this flick on TV during Christmas holidays and it looked a cute romcom. I can't imagine how they cleaned it up for basic cable because this movie is so crude, filled with obscenity and laced with ugly sex jokes (the male lead actually goes pants down in front of the face of his prospective mother-in-law). The F-word appears multiple times in just about every sentence and the c-word crops up gratuitously every few minutes. The plot premise is clever, but the development is so over the top that it is absurd. There is nothing that motivates the major romance, either.The only reason I watched this to the end was to see if it ever pulled back from drilling down to the lowest common denominator. I can't believe Kate Hudson trashed herself for this pointless flick. I wish I hadn't and you shouldn't."
3,Scathingly Funny First Half...,"When the movie is trying to be funny it is hilarious. Luckily that's about the first half of the movie or so. Then it switches gears (or screeches to a halt is a better way to put it), and it tries to be romantic and sweet. But trying to be romantic and sweet when you've just been wall-to-wall, balls to the wall vulgar for so long...it just seems pointless. Luckily at the end it has one more great jolt of comedy left in it, which in the end was worth hanging around for. If the fat was trimmed off this sucker, it could have been a classic. Still recommended, and highly for Dane Cook fans; he really runs wild here. If you were disappointed by his movies thus far (ex. Good Luck Chuck with Jessica Alba...horrible), don't worry, this one delivers the goods...albeit with the aforementioned and unfortunate ""shoe-horned in"" romantic plot which waters down the fun."
1,Disappointed,"The picture fades in and out, it's discolored and there are scratches on the disc. I was very disappointed when the actual picture disappeared during segments of the movie which totally ruined the flow of the movie."
2,Not Quite a Dane Cook fan yet...,"This movie had some funny and very crude humor...(We love Judd Apatow crude humor) there just seems to be something missing. My wife and I watched this movie on Blu-Ray(Which has horrible compression by the way, as she stated, ""This looks like we are watching it on VHS"") and we laughed here and there, but to be honest, after the first 30 mins, I was ready to go out and snow blow the driveway. I have tried to give Dane Cook a chance, and he just doesn't do it for me. Besides His role in Dan in Real life, his acting is rather unbeliveable and he often looks as though he is just trying too hard. And Kate Hudson, well, she is the same person in every movie, very one dimiensional. I would like to say this would be a good movie for a snowy day, but it wasn't. The only reason I give it 2 stars is that I do like Alec Baldwin in his very brief role."
4,Unique story line,"I liked the movie, the unique story line was interesting. The actors played their roles very well. It is the story of two people who fall in love without planning too."
2,"Foul, With Only Couple Funny Parts",I suspected this would be one of those movies with funny people and a lousy script. I was right. Biggs character is just a dud and a waste of time in the story. Cook is at his foulest and over the top most of the movie. There are only a few funny parts.Its just not very good. Save yourself the money and just rent it.
3,Wow the language,"Have to admit the idea was funny...but the language was awful, awful...love Dane, but language could have been cleaned up a bit and it still would have been funny."
5,Dictionary of Modern Star Names,a dictionary of modern star names is a good dictionary. I recommend it to other that would like to find out about star names. you can't go wrong with it.
1,Terrible Design,"The way their hinge is designed, there's a gap of a good inch between their visor and the car visor -- just what you don't want when you're trying to block glaring sun. The Trillium Sun Zapper is another one I bought and their design doesn't have this problem -- it fits snuggly against the car visor without a gap."
4,Pretty Good,"I bought this book after being a fan of Lachapelle for a few years- and i've already got Hotel LaChapelle.This book doesn't really compare that well to Hotel Lachapelle, but its a good book to have if u want to document his work pre 1996, and although it has some stunning photographs, i was more impressed by the (presumably bigger budget) photos in Hotel Lachapelle, so. in a nutshell; if you trying to decide between this and His second book, get the second one, but this isnt a bad book to have."
2,better suited for pre teens,"The second of the trilogy, this books is slightly more interesting with the addition of the Greek Gods as characters, but the storyline, characters and plot are still very simplistic and more suited for the younger readers. A large portion of the story involves the three children of Jarl as well as a young dragon, who constantly pops in and out of the situation. Some of the quips are amusing, but it gets old after a while. Pre teens will like this second installment, as it focuses more on the children, but adults will find it a simplistic and boring story."
5,"Lovely compilation, but missing some of my favorite songs","My introduction to Meg Christian's work was her LP ""From The Heart."" I fell in love with her music, and while ""The Best of Meg Christian"" is, without a doubt, full of beautiful songs and lovely vocals from Meg, I miss some of the songs that may not have been her most popular, but which I liked: ""Willing to Go"", ""Living in the Moment,"" ""You Got My Attention,"" ""Happy Birthday"" and ""Here to There.""My understanding is that Olivia records is so more; maybe that's why ""From the Heart"" never made it to CD form. I'm sorry it didn't; it was wonderful.But that being said, this CD is a keeper. I'm buying my second copy because my old CD player ate the first one and won't spit it back out :)I find Christian's songs inspirational. I'm sorry she seems to have retired. I hope that wherever she is now, that she's peaceful and happy. But it's our loss."
4,A definate pleaser...if you like this type of music,"I was impressed. Ben Folds put together a fantastic sounding album, and played most of the insruments himself. I am a HUGE Ben Folds Five fan and was drawn in mainly because of Folds's amazing talent @ the piano. I was expecting a BFF-sound alike on his solo album, until weeks before the release of this album, I heard it was going to have a techno sound. Bought the album, and found myself quite attatched to ""Avery M Powers..."" and ""slo jam 98"". ""In Love"" is probably the only song I do not like and skip over when its playing. Shatner just doesnt do it for me. Anyways, I am one to have an ear for techno music, so I guess that did a big part in the reason why I like FOP so much. If you're a Ben Folds Five fan and dont fancy the sound of techno, don't buy this record unless you want to force yourself to like everything Folds spits out, which I find to be pathetic."
1,Ben Folds Failed on this attempt,"I bought this album because I love Ben Folds Five, but much to my dismay this album had an electronic freakiness and a joking William Shatner in the mix. The lack of true alt-pop/ alt-rock that Ben Folds is known for makes this album a must have for all who need everything that has Ben's name on the label, but if you want to listen to the piano solos and harmonizing that I love BFF for this is not a wise purchase."
2,Let's hope the next effort is a better one,"I'm sorry, Ben Folds, but ditching Darren Jessee and Robert Sledge was a poor choice. After four incredible and incisive albums, BFF should have taken a well-deserved break and regrouped for a fifth killer album. Instead, we have Ben leaving the continent to pursue domestic bliss and recording this mess of kitsch, keyboards and noise. Not to say that these are bad ingredients, but that here they're formless and the ideas are undercooked. What made BFF a great act was the synthesis of wit, talent and musicianship. What makes this album a disappointment is the lack of focus, polish and practice. Ben Folds is a ridiculously talented musician, but not necessarily one who has mastered instruments beyond the piano. I hope he gets a chance to work with the trio again, some time in the future."
4,Ben Folds meets Fat Boy Slim,"This CD is a big change from the Ben Folds Five CDs we all know and love, highlighting the talents of Folds in a different light. Rhythmic bass and drum loops, a small touch of piano, and well placed vocal harmonies yield extremely catchy tunes. Only a few of the songs follow a traditional verse-refrain pattern. The rest resemble a Fat Boy Slim style with drum and bass loops carrying the song intermixed with sampled vocals and other instruments. The ending result is a great collection of easy-to-get into, fun songs."
3,a perplexing album,"I love Ben Folds, but always thought his best songs were his weirdest. These are usually the songs NOT on regular albums, but b-sides, etc. (Morgan Davis, Bizarre Xmas Incident, Morgan Lane, She Don't Use Jelly, Hiro's Song, [...], Why Does This Always Happen to Me, etc.).But this CD is very different. If you like fully formed, serious Ben Folds songs, this CD may not be for you. If you like the radio friendly AND the weird, bizarre Ben Folds, this CD may be a nice addition to your Ben Folds collection. For me, ""In Love"" with William Shatner is worth the price of admission.These flashes of brilliance from Ben Folds -- which most people will never hear -- are worth investigating."
1,What- I can't give this a ZERO???,I like Ben Folds Five- and this album was advertised as half pop/half comedy. I thought about buying it and should have taken a hint of the quality of this CD when it was being sold NEW at a store for 2.98 a month after it's release. I sold it back to the store after a week for a quarter- this just might be the worst album ever made- their are no catchy tunes- they almost aren't any tunes whatsoever- and it's not funny- just pointless- I'd rather watch paint dry for 45 minutes than listen to this cd.
1,"Keep Ben Folds, lose Shatner","I must say that this is a very ""different"" album with Shatner singing. I love Ben Folds and was willing to take a chance with Shatner being on this. (I had hoped he might be in the background banging a spoon on a glass or something rather than signing.) The song ""In Love"" has great music and vocals by Ben, but Shatner ruins it. I wish there was a version I could by that didn't have him in it because it really is a good song.Matt Zarnstorff"
4,"funk, and jam","Can we say Funk, well thats the word that comes to mind when i first heard ""Kops""(track 2). this track is action packed with a 70's karma, cop chasing, superfly, bell bottom, afro sporting excitment. the ability to create a great track that can capture all these images is hard to do, this album contains great creativity and not to mention a beautiful title, if u like complicated funky sounds, this is a must to have! Adios Kops!"
4,Whazzat?,"I purchased Fear of Pop because it was amongst the last of Ben Folds CDs I had yet to buy. I dig the man, and heard this CD was different, so I went ahead and bought it. With that aside, the CD is different indeed. This disc takes a more electronic approach, to say the least. Whereas most of the BFF and solo works have roots in 70's era pop (ala Billy Joel), this goes with a more 70's ""groovy"" sound; somewhat danceable funk. You really don't realize it's Folds on a lot of these tracks, you sorta get [dragged] into the whole concept more than listen track, then track and so on. Keep that in mind. It does in fact take an open ear and mind to really appreciate it, but don't take the title lightly, this is NOT a pop album like his others. The anti-pops might dig this one. Some Bjork-esque elements (well, a lot) are in this too, which might appeal to some also. Plus you can't go wrong with William Shatner, c'mon people."
2,A Strange Departure for Ben Folds After the split with the 5.,"Well i am a HUGE fan of Bens and have loved everthing he has done, but this one is a little out there.While i didn't hate it, i know i wont be listning to it over and over again, but it will get a few listens.But if your a Ben Folds Fan you have to at least check it out."
4,"Different, but cool.","You can definately tell that Fear of Pop is the work of Ben Folds - I think the CD is just plain awesome. There's never a dull moment, and I absolutely love ""In Love"" with William Shatner ""singing"". :-)"
2,Not that impressed,"I really wanted to like this product but after two weeks, I'm tossing it. It does a great job at keeping liquids cold which was the main selling point for us. However, it leaks way too much! This is the leakiest sippy cup we've ever owned. Another con is that the fluids get stuck around the bottom of the mouthpiece. Not a huge deal if you have water in the cup, but when you have milk, it gets gross after a few hours. There needs to be a tighter fit."
2,SUPER Leaky...,"I was excited about this product until I realized that the thing leaks not only from the spout, but the sides of the screw-on top as well. Once the purple top spout is removed for cleaning, you can forget it - it doesn't snap back into the pink top and it leaks everywhere. It's almost as if it's not supposed to come out, although it must. It didn't leak the first week because I didn't realize that the purple spout was a separate piece. I'm definitely bummed, as they aren't cheap and I bought three. I'll use them when she gets a little older and isn't prone to flinging the cup across the room. BTW, I just received the Kleen Kanteen 12-oz. sippy in the mail. After testing it right away, it leaks from the spout too, although not nearly as bad. Don't use it on your carpeted areas, parents!"
2,leaks!!,"I was so excited to get these cups, but the leak like crazy. There are 5 parts to the cup: the cup, the lid, the spout and 2 pieces to the leak proof valve... what a pain! It would be worth it though, if it didn't leak, which it does. I would not recommend this cup, in fact mine are in the goodwill bag."
2,Could have been a lot better,There are 4 dvd's in this set I unfortunately own 2 of them Volume 1 and Volume 2. The price is nice considering you do get 8 episodes per disc. Thats about the only good thing I can say. The quality is horrible. The bonus feature has got to be somebodies idea of a joke. And none of the episodes contain the original theme song. Anybody with a TV capture card and a dvd burner could have made a better collection than this.
5,THE BEST DEAL EVER EVERYTHING ABOUT JORDA IN ONE PACK!!!,"EVERYTHING U NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE BEST PLAYER EVER IN ONE COOL PACK FOR A LOW PRICE, MICHAEL JORDAN IN EVERY STEP OF HIS CARREER IS IN HERE, U CAN'T MISS THIS IF U ARE A BASKETBALL FAN!!"
5,Stunning!,"So glad I bought this, what a gem of a disc set covering one of, if not THE, greatest sportsman to grace this earth! Definitely get the 3 disc collector's edition, just to witness 5 complete games of His Airness in action!"
4,A man above all,"The Ultimate Jordan collection is a rare find; a raw compilation of Jordan's life on and off the court that - convincingly - reveals the man beneath the player. It is a must see as it features successive documentaries--from his early childhood to the six and final NBA championship title, topped off with his 5 all-time games. His determination and creativity will be forever remembered in the Bulls 23 singlet. However his personality; charisma; and optimism are why he remains so profoundly loved today."
5,All You Could Ever Want,This DVD is amazing and it has so much jordan stuff that it will take you forever to see it all.
4,My brother in law loved this,He is a Jordan fan and we got it for his birthday. He LOVES it! I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com.
4,a fine giallo,"The opening ten minutes are a little rough, with an overdose of crash zooms, distorting lenses, clunky dialogue and poor model work. After the first story twist, however, the film becomes a superior giallo, worthy of comparison with Bava and Argento. Director Sergio Martino stages some strong set-pieces, displaying a visual flair only hinted at in THE STRANGE VICE OF MRS WARDH. It's possible Dario Argento saw SCORPION'S TAIL before making DEEP RED, as some scenes are remarkably similar (check out the murder in the theatre). There's even a bold female reporter, who helps unmask the killer at great personal risk. While DEEP RED is the better film, Argento owes Martino a debt or two. George Hilton is a solid lead - is it his own voice on the Italian soundtrack? - and spaghetti western regular Luigi Pistilli adds a touch of class in a rare good guy role. The plot twists are satisfying, though the photo blow-up trick was well parodied by Mel Brooks in HIGH RISK."
5,Nerve Test for Strategists,Wow!What an excellent simulation!! Nerve recking! Can't sleep withourt seeing the results every day. Better than the class room teachings and bag full of articles and books. Tests your marketing knowledge to the ultimate limits. Best part of this simulation is that no one losses and no one wins but every one LEARNS AND A LOT . This simulation is an eye-opener to the so called market strategists. The team spirit is revitalised and real leaders emerge. I recommend to all serious marketing strategists.
4,Solid Lego toy,"My son (who just turned 2) received this for Christmas. He also received a lot of other Thomas things. He enjoys playing with it very much - we obviously have to teach him how to connect the traks and build Knapford Station, Thomas, etc... It goes with his other Duplo blocks and another bonus is that his 5 year old sister also enjoys this toy. It doesn't have very many ""Bells and whistles"" which is why I didn't give it the 5 stars, but he still enjoys it very much."
4,Not too bad at all,"The music is pretty good, not the some ol', same ol' Puccini. And the recipes read good, so I can't wait to try them!"
3,Dylan is never really easy.,"""BOB DYLAN Made Easy for Guitar"" is more title than description. Featuring 22 songs ranging from the well known (Tangled Up in Blue), to the obsure (Man Gave Names to All the Animals), Dylan Made Easy doesn't give any hints or suggestions to accomplish that promise. This is simply a songbok featuring Dylan's material in their orginal keys; however, the songs are notatated with chords and rythm slashes. The songs themselves are not necessarily easy. Most songs quite often contain barre chords or would be easy to play with barre chords or capo's. I was hoping that this book would explain simpler, easier, methods to obtain the melodies and rythms that pervade Bob Dylan songs. This book is good is a fairly good songbook if your looking for a variety of Dylan material."
5,"Basia, ""The Sexiest"", ""Most Alluring"", Female Vocalist of all time!!","First time I heard ""Basia"" I fell in love with the artist and her music, I especially love her video ""Basia: A New Day"" (I wish and hope she will do more video). Finally this year Mar 24th 2009 a new CD release for Basia. I've waited for this new release for several years, ""It's that Girl Again: by Basia"". What can I say, if you enjoy listening to a, {In my opinion} a totally unique style of music, purchase this CD, or any of her material from Amazon.com, Basia's greatest hit's CD ""Clear Horizon: The Best of Basia"". Take care!!!"
4,Great to Have Some Live Performances,"More than just a collection of her previously released works, includes life performances as well. A must for any Basia fan."
5,Doesn't get much better than this!,"I love Basia and have followed her career for many years. This is a ""Greatest Hits"" album that really is GREAT - there's not a bad track on it. This CD would make a great introduction to Basia for those who haven't been fortunate enough to experience her tremendous talent yet. After you hear it, you'll probably run out and buy the rest of her albums - she's that good!"
3,I only knew one song...and still do,"I bought this disc because I liked her hit CRUISING FOR BRUISING. it was a great hit on the adult contemporary charts in the 90s. The other songs are very different. I know Basia is in a different genre but I thought there would be more songs that would be catchy like CRUISING.She is very talented but if you are looking for other songs like CRUISING, you won't find it."
4,Hawk Brake Pads,"I wouldn't , expect auto parts from Amazon, but why not? They came very fast. The pads were of high quality but I haven't really noticed any significant stopping distance from the previous Motorcraft pads on my 1992 Mustang. But they work. Thanks Hawk and Amazon."
5,"Had it for 12 years, just buying more!","We registered for this set at Crate & Barrel when we got married 12 years ago. What a fantastic product! The only thing wrong is I have lost a few pieces, so I am buying more :) We have formal fine china as well as every day plates, and this silverware perfectly goes with either one. I don't know why we would ever go with another silverware set for the rest of our lives until we just cant get more! And by the way, a set of 5 pieces (knife, 2 forks, 2 spoons) is $49.95 at other stores! This is a GREAT deal from Amazon!"
2,Not so great,My baby grew out of this fast. She could push her feet out the bottom and pull her arms out the top. I suggest the swaddle me works way better and they have a bigger size when they grow out of the newborn one
1,A must miss!,"This thing is basically useless for my baby. The velcro portion is positioned in such a way that it's impossible to get it snug enough. After rewrapping and going in to my crying daughter 5 or 6 times the first night, I fished my kiddopotomus out of the laundry, wrapped her up and haven't heard a peep since. This swaddler will be going straight to Good Will."
1,Suffocating,"Every child is different but my daughter hated this. She hated the swaddler, screamed and wriggled out whenever we put her in it, no matter how loosely wrapped. She preferred the sleep sack which is easier to put on."
1,"Missed A Lot, Too!","While Bird outlines how McCloy gained his proficiency at manipulating the law to further the criminal aims of his wealthy patrons, Bird also avoids telling us just how involved McCloy was in the multifarious treasons (both plotted and committed) by the Harrimans, the Rockefellers, the Bushes, the Dullesses and others before and during WWII.Nor does Bird suggest how deeply involved McCloy was in the paranoid spasms of (especially) Allen Dulles - in the destruction of Eastern Europe, in the anti-democracy coup in Iran, etc.In short, this is a great volume if you idolize treason and felony committed to enhance personal wealth and power at the expense of the national security of this country."
2,Disappointed,I purchased these boots on line and was a little disappointed with the size. I ordered a size 8.5 and they feel more like a 9.5. I ordered these boots due to the fact that Clarks makes the most comfortable shoes and I have purchased quite a few on line in Canada. With these boots it was diappointing and I ordered it from what I thought was a store and yet the address was supposedly from a gentleman's address. Don't think I will be purchasing anything from here again. Really a huge disappointment.
4,Good Naughty Fun,"Spicy and hilarious are two words I use when I describe this book to my friends. I picked it up as an impulse buy and was not disappointed. The story of this real woman and her completely messed-up personal life (an OCD mother and a hypochondriac husband, not to mention her quirky friend...) grabs you as a reader and makes you want more. This is the reason it loses a star, I wanted more at the end. The rest of the book was so great that the end was anticlimactic (I'm not giving anything away, don't worry). It was wonderful to see a strong woman in the driver's seat, both sexually and in the day-to-day. Margolis goes into heart-racing detail that will make you forget where you are because you just want to see what's next. ""Neurotica"" is definitely a book worth reading."
2,"Funnny, but very thin, and ultimately stupid","I laughed out loud multiple times reading this book, which is why it took a while for me to realize that ""funny lines do not a good book make."" The plot is far fetched, the characters are superficial, the ""erotica"" is crass and amateurish, and the ending is absurd. It barely qualifies as a good beach read, and I felt like I needed a bath upon finishing it. I gave it two stars for the humor. But really--dumb, dumb, dumb."
5,Loved it and still laughing....,A book so funny you laugh remembering it. If there is a movie Sue Margolis must write the screenplay and all the actors have to be British.
3,After reading her other two books....,"I wasn't that impressed with Margolis's first novel.I had attempted to read ""Neurotica"" about 5 times before finally sitting down and starting over again. Dan is a hypochondriac (who diagnosis himself in very unusual, hilarious ways) and it's driving his wife, Anna crazy.This book will share Dan's quest to find out the root of his sickness, Anna's adulterous relationship(s) and the adventures that Anna's mother has to deal with from a stalker.Neurotica has some very funny moments which include Anna trying to color her gray pubic hairs with ""Bush Magic"" before her first extra marital affair and Dan taking a poop in a pickle jar to take to a Gastro doctor.Unfortunately, I didn't start becoming involved with the characters until halfway through the book but I am glad that I followed through until the end.Margols has come a LONG way with her two latest books, Spin Cycle and Apocolipstic which are two of my fav's!"
1,Not worth the time,I wasn't expecting great literature when I picked up this book - but often even the most light summer reading has some redeeming quality such as a likeable main character. I found Anna to be an absolutely ridiculous character and the book not worth the time (or money).
2,An amusing disappointment,"This book is a bit on the absurd side, which I like, but it left me wanting more. I guess I like my heroines to be a little more realistic -- or a lot funnier. I didn't buy into the story-line, even though I did find some of the scenes amusing.Good brain candy, but a disappointment if you're looking for meaningful literature."
2,Didn't like it.,"Hateful characters, offensive plot, serviceable writing. Maybe I'm just getting old, but the pubic hair scene didn't even make me crack a smile. Toilet humor, too. Jeez."
2,disappointing,"I got about half way through the book, but just couldn't bother with the rest. There were some very funny bits but unfortunately, not enough to make a good read."
1,Wow! This book was sooooooo BAD!,I have read 3 other Sue Margolis boks and enjoied them all. This book was really really BAD!
4,Hilariously Funny,"Neurotica is a hilariously funny novel about tabloid journalist Anna Shapiro who is assigned to write an article about female adultery. This seems like the perfect assignment for Anna who decides to do a little hands on research after years of having her husband Dan, who is a hypochondriac, refusing to have sex with her for fear that he may have a heart attack. Anna's exploits are so funny that they will have you laughing out loud but even funnier is Dan's fear of...well everything from testicular cancer to spontaneous human combustion. These two paired with Anna's mother who is being stalked by a fellow obsessive compulsive group member and Anna's best friend Brenda who is by Anna's side through it all while getting into a little trouble of her own makes for a very amusing read.I haven't read a whole lot of British humor but after reading Neurotica I will definitely be reading much, much more. If you want an easy and entertaining read this is the book for you! 4 Stars!"
1,Boring and Ridiculous,"Both boring and ridiculous, didn't find this book worth the short time it took to finish."
1,Fluff -- and not even GOOD fluff,"When the ecstatic blurb on the cover is from People Magazine, that should be a tip-off! Speaking of magazines, this seemed like a book written for women who still think of themselves as wild ""Cosmo Girls."" The author tries way too hard to be risque."
2,Not so great overall,"This book is only 'okay'. I don't think Sue Margolis is a real person. There is no author info or photo on the book, so this is probably written by a couple of people. Overall, it's lame, but there are a couple of choice sections. There are too many other good books floating around to bother wasting your time with this one."
3,Saucy then Sizzled,"Being a big Bridget Jones fan, I read the book cause of the expert which said the book picked up from where Bridget Jones would have left off. Anywho, the book was good at first and funny but then all of a sudden it was over...blah...poof...done. I was hoping there would have been a better ending. The first part of the book was good, the middle dragged and the ending was just...well the end. Over all, if you need a summer book to read by the pool go ahead and pick it up."
1,Disappointing,"I loved Spin Cycle by Sue Margolis so I went out and got Neurotica right away. I could not have been more disappointed by this book. I thought it was totally tasteless, crass and unrealistic to name a few things. I usually really like these types of books (British Humor), but this one was truly awful. It was like I was reading a book by a totally different author than Spin Cycle, I couldn't believe it. I'd advise anyone to steer clear of this one, but that's just my taste."
2,Slightly Erotica..........,"well, it took me so long to get into this book that i had to start it over a few times to remind me what it was that i read. i finally sat down to finish it, but it seemed to drag for me. the characters seemed weird and superficial.i found anna's infidelities quite disturbing. it was very upsetting, since dan was trying desperately to deal with his own neuroses and idiosyncrasies to make the marriage work.i was, however, happy with the ending and the television show anna ended up on. there were a few cute one liners which made me smile.as far as anna's mother, it just didn't work for me. i found her character to be boring and contrite.all-in-all, this was a pretty blah book and i am glad that it is over."
3,"Interesting, but ending was bad","This was truly a funny, funny book, but I thought the ending was a bit of a let down. Also, at times it was a bit crude. I would recommend it to my single 20ish friends, but think it would offend some (most?) of my married/divored 30ish or 40ish friends. Yes, they have a sense of humor but this would cross the line: ""hair dye"" is one example."
1,Very dissapointing.,"I bought the book Stretch to Win first and then bought the video in hopes that the video would fill in the gaps in the book. It does not. The video doesn't offer any new information. The gap is that the book is supposed to give you the keys to developing your own sport specific program. There is a section in the book that details what different sports need in terms of types of stretches. There is another section that lists stretches, but there is no section that explains what stretches belong to what categories.The DVD just shows the ""sample"" stretch routines being done. There is a football player, a baseball player and a golfer showing stretches that they do. And a girl who demonstrates some specific stretches. The DVD is touted as giving you the ability to print off workouts. This is just a PDF file that again just replicates sections out of the book. I would strongly encourage others to look elsewhere."
4,Great first book about owls,"The barn owl is certainly a unique species, and is an excellent subject for a book meant to introduce young children to the world of owls, and birds in general. The illustrations are excellent, and the text for the most part is easy to read. The occasional advanced word is encountered, but this is hardly a problem. Overall, an excellent book."
3,A picturebook with factual information.,"Animal Lives: The Barn Owl is a picturebook with factual data, a genre I am generally pleased with. Given the picturebook format, I felt that some of the vocabulary choices would be very difficult for younger or struggling readers, i.e. superefficient sense of hearing, perilous flight. That said, the information about barn owls is well presented and researched, the illustrations are accurate and well-done, and the book includes resources and information about conservation. The author follows one barn owl pair as they raise their first brood of young-from courtship to leaving the nest. A nice insight into the lives of the owls."
2,Memory was better than reality,"My mom turned me on to Alba milkshakes in the '70s and I remember them tasting pretty good. I was thrilled to find them on Amazon after all these years. So I ordered this item, which is a massive quantity. Now I'm trying to find people to give them to since I can't force the fake, aftertaste-laden stuff down my throat. I don't know if it's different ingredients or my faulty memory, but the stuff is terribly disappointing, and borderline disgusting."
2,Too Much Echo!,"An otherwise great compilation is marred by excessive use of echo/processing.Joe is an ""intimate"" singer. This calls for an intimate sound. In some waysit appears that his vocal mic was somewhere near the ceiling. Another exampleof how some engineers can ruin a good product."
2,Maudlin Tear Jerker,"Maudlin tear jerker. Skip Applause and buy 1936 version of Showboat. Helen's versions of ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man of Mine"" and ""Bill"" in Showboat are brilliant and unforgettable. In addition to Helen's singing, the whole movie is a classic. It may take a few minutes to get over the black and white format, but it's worth the effort."
4,so you want to be a Master,I think should be the title of this book. I recommend it as a read thru of a step by step guide for those interested in line work and advancing in Masonary.
2,False advertising: does NOT have Photocell,"Be aware that, contrary to its description, this product does NOT have a photocell. It will NOT detect ambient light and will NOT turn itself on/off. After much time with customer service trying to figure out how the photocell worked, it was learned from the manufacturer that they discontinued the photocell line."
4,Great Product,"Good price along with a nice tool for extracting fuses, the only thing I would change is the box design to lower the risk of the fuses falling out of the packaging."
2,FUSE PLIERS TOO WIDE,"8 seperate boxes 1 for each sise fuse was ok (thought it was one box for all)The tester/pliers is a different story.I havent been able to get the tester to work and the pliers are to wide to pull the fuses from my Chevy Equinox.Needle nose pliers and select fuses are by far the way to go, not as compact but that works!"
4,works as advertised,"Works as advertised. Stick a 9 volt battery at one end, and you have 9 VDC at the other. What will they think of next?"
1,Odd...,"Ordered two of these, sent me the wrong battery clips and didn't send it through postage properly, had to pay the mailman when it came (which ironically, the postage ended up being more than the clips themselves) maybe just a fluke, but I was not impressed with the service."
1,Rip Off,This item was sold for $4.49 ea. There are several of the same item for .49 cents.Total Rip off
2,Sadly a requirement or I would never have purchased...,"Horribly vague with far too few examples. Not enough explanation of anything. Amazing that schools can sell such a worthless book at a premium. If you have a choice, do NOT purchase this book. Not if you really hope to understand and master the language, and possibly have a vague idea of how to use it. Not with this book."
3,Very uneven.,"The songs on this CD range from excellent to horrible. Black Blade, Monsters, Deadline, and Lips in the Hills are great. But The Marshall Plan, Divine Wind, Unknown Tounge,and Hungry Boys are ones that you should skip over. In the middle is Fallen Angel, which is catchy but gets boring quickly. It's a good CD, but definitely not the first one you should get by the BOC. I recommend Cult Classic, which is easily the best BOC collection ever."
2,very weak,"This is not a band that should be dabbling in jazz.As for the production I am listening to a very flat sounding (1980) album of very unmemorable songs.OK ""Black Blade"" is interesting.I am a fan of BOC but we all must fall from a mountaintop."
4,a rocksolid album,"tagged ""Heavy Metal"" or Hard Rock"" is not always a recommendation, in every sense. This 1980 B.Ö.C. album is neither, released after ""Mirrors"" which adopted a softer style. Powerpop describes this band more, but on stage it is somewhat different the matter. This album is more guitar orientated and therefore sounds heavier, although there are keyboards present on several songs. The opener ""Black Blade"" is an eerie tale, with strange soundeffects, co-written with SF author Michael Moorcock. A solid rocksong. The next ""Monsters"" starts in the same vein but is interrupted by a jazzy part, complete with saxophone, which is repeated a few times but climaxes in the rockmode. This goes for the other songmaterial, more leaning towards hard rock but recognisable as B.Ö.C. songs. All in all a good album, which hasn't lost any of its impact almost 3 decades earlier. I still find pleasure in listening to it."
5,Hosehead's Review,"This is my favorite BOC album! It got very little air play, but I think it's their most solid album of all time. I've seen them 11 times in concert, and I'm always hopeful to hear just one song from this album. What fantasy rock star can't relate to The Marshall Plan? What Sci Fi nut can't get into Black Blade and Monstars? And then there's the message to all the Muslim terrorist in Divine Wind. This is BOC at their best!"
5,This album rocks!,"Strange, but fascinatingly diverse and good. My favorite of all BOC albums, and I own every studio recording. It is also in my top 20 albums. And I mean albums, as in records, of which I have over 400. Even ""hungry boys"" which some disdain has some great guitar work. I will have to buy the CD, as I am afraid I will wear this LP out."
3,cd Annette Hanshaw,Good cd content but there were flaws in the recording (stalling out with repetitive sound in two or three places)
2,Jeanette MacDonald was great,"This was NOT a great musical. It was fun to see all these people when they were young,as I only remember them older here in the states. Maurice was his usual 'speak sing' and Jeanette was learning but great voice. This would not fit the title of 'musical' as we know them today."
3,Not quite as good....,"The Deception is not quite as good as others in the Animorphs Series. My son said it was O.K. which is not his usually enthusiastic endorsement of anything ""Animorph""."
3,complicated,"first of all,this plot,though confusing,is neccessary.Ax is showing signs of ruthlessness,so extreme he even knocked out Jake. even though people are right about this being the climax of the series, I want the series to never end."
1,What Happened!,"OK, write this one off. After I read book #45, I thought, ""Oh, wow! Things are really going to be moving now! I can't wait to read the next one!"" But, this? There was really no point in it. The beginning was good, but the story itself was a real put-down. I hope that the next one (#47, for all you math wizards out there) will be better."
3,Use for Fun rather than accuracy.,"My son got this product for Christmas. The idea of this bank is that it counts your coins so you know how much money you have. He loves this bank-it is durable and large enough to fit quite a bit of change.I have issues with the bank, though. It often counts pennies as dimes and it does not recognise dimes at all. We put them in and it does not register any amount.If you are ok with the inaccuracies in the amount then this is a bank that you would like to purchase."
2,Money Jar,I liked the concept of this toy if it actually worked past the 5 minutes my son had it. You should have seen his excitement when he first put his change in and then the disappointment when it stopped working after the first handful of change. I tried calling the company 4 times with no avail.
3,no dollar,"Seems to work fine so far. Does not accept dollar coins (but you can force them in) - counts them as quarters - so I guess it does not accept anything larger than a quarter. The mechanism is a bit unnatural - rather than simply drop your coins in, you must actually push them through the slot and resistance is felt. I think it uses a mechanical device to sense how large the coin is as it is pushed through the opening. My 8 year old daughter likes it anyhow."
2,Big hit with great disappointment,"This money counter was great for a short while, but the spring mechanism could not hold up to the use."
5,Simple and comfortable,"I was looking for a chair with a roomy seat (I'm a big guy, 280 lbs) and adjustable height and tilt. The chair was as advertised. It was simple to assemble and it is nice and comfortable. I recommend it to others.It was shipped the same business day and was delivered the next business day."
1,Piece of Junk,Wish I read the last two reviews before I bought this thing. I thought it was pretty decent when I first sat in it. Had the chair 2 months and I only weigh 180 lbs. The armrest has snapped in two places which makes it completely useless because the backrest is supported by only the armrest. It also wobbles like crazy. Do not buy this piece of junk.
3,too little cushion,The edges of the arms already have small tears. The leather feels like pleather and is not supple. The cushion is not plush and is down right hard.I would not purchase this chair again. Im hoping the chair last.But I know the arms will continue to tear then the flimsy wheels will break.
5,Pretty Nice,"This chair was pretty nice and sturdy. It lasted us about 2 years. It would have last longer if hubby didn't feel the need to lean back in it and cause it to be on only two rollers 90% of the time causing the back to finally snap off (I wish I had my video camera for when it happen. The look on his face was priceless.) If I had known he needed a recliner I would have gotten that instead, would have lasted longer. I am sure the chair would have held up better if it had been treated better."
2,Not an easy read while traveling,"This book had several small errors in text and maps, it was not fun looking for the hotel carrying your luggage around. Also the book is divided into unlogical sections, so you'll never find the info you are looking for unless you remember where it was mentioned. We bought it because there was also a short part about Whistler. That was also not that informative, nothing about the slopes or skiing. The book gives you basic details (except I could not find Vancouvers population) in a bit confusing manner, but nothing extra. It also has no pictures, what makes it a bit uninteresting. The layout and fonts are boring."
2,Mistakes not corrected,"This text, no matter how good, cannot be recommended. There is a huge mistake that exists with the letter: t', it comes off incorrectly printed as: afl. Thus, any occurance of a word which contains the letter t', reads as: afl.The Czech word: at' will appear as the nonCzech word: afl and the Czech word: vrat' will appear as the nonCzech word: vrafl.I wrote to the publisher four years ago asking for my money back. They only offered a corrected copy when it would be printed. I've never received one, and, these incorrect texts are on the shelves in book stores worldwide.Look at pages 205, 208 and 215 for some incorrect words.Once again, no matter the good and great things in this book, you will learn an embarrassing Czech that does not exist if you use this book. Buyer beware!"
1,"okay movie, but nothing like the book","I was so excited when I found out they had made a movie out of my favorite book- Love Comes Softly by Janette Oke. The book is so touching and so sweet and wonderful.However, I was deeply disappointed when I watched the movie. The movie is so loosely based on the the book, it's like watching a different story. The movie changed names, Marty's first husband was Clem and she named their son Claridge, which was her maiden name; ""Sarah"" Graham wasn't named in the book, she went by ""Ma"" and Missie was only 1, not 8, just to name a few facts they missed. I was also disturbed by the fact that they put in a few bad words and a scene that isn't clean or nice. The book is very clean.Overall, the story is pretty good, although not very much like the book. Bottom line, a pretty good movie about pioneer life, but please don't judge the book by the movie. The book is 50 times better than the movie."
2,Why?,"I recently read ""Love Come Softly"" and decided to check out the hallmark movie edition. What a disappointment. This is not Clark and Marty Davis from the book. Instead we have pouty-lipped straggly-haired actress playing the part of Marty- and a hefty middle-aged guy playing Clark. Sorry, Clark and Marty are both young- and Clark was NEVER fat. Nor that old. Missy was very young not a pre-teen, and Marty's husband was named Clem not Aaron.Many of the changes made to the screenplay were senseless and added nothing to the plot. (Such as the name switch). I found the film version disappointing and saccharin. Please read the book. Its much better."
1,Love Leads the Way!,I absolutely loved this movie. It was rich in values and innocence and at the same time it was real. The actors were superb!
5,excellent movie for all ages,love comes softly was an excellent movie that the whole family could watch together. i wish more of the janette oke books were made into movies.
3,Beautiful story portrayed with Heigl's mediocre acting,"As a long-time fan of the novel, I looked forward to seeing this movie. I enjoyed the film although I was distracted by Katherine Heigl's distracting lack of acting ability. This was before Grey's Anatomy came out, and I had never heard of her when I watched the film. Her speaking parts were very wooden, and she appeared to have come straight from a high school acting class. I had to take 2 stars off of my rating for this alone, since she's the central character. All of the other actors were wonderful, although their interpretations of the characters differed from my imagination, as expected when a book is made into a film. I highly recommend this series for Little House on the Prairie fans."
5,Wonderful movie,Bought this for my teenage grandaughter and she watched it and loved it. I loved it too and it is a movie that I don't mind rewatching.
1,Sappy to the max,"If you enjoy saccharine entertainment, this one's for you. Bad acting and weak plot lines do not a good story make. I'll pass in future."
5,dvd -Love Comes Softly,"""Oh my goodness!!!"" If you LOVE a feel good, emotional roll-a-coaster, family movie. This is it!! This is one of the best movies I have ever watched. It has all the elements of every emotion you can come up with. The actors are superb and you feel like your part of the scene. I have watched it 3 times and will watch it again. Just make sure you have a box of kleenex handy."
5,I cried AND laughed!!!!,"This is one of the sweetest,purest love storiesi've ever seen! Marty, a pioneer woman moves to the western plains and quickly finds herself a widow with no way to survive. Clark Davis offers her a place to live and promises to pay her way back home next spring if she teaches his 9 year old daughter to do things she is missing out on. They marry (because in the mid 1800's you couldn't live together unless you married) and by spring Marty learns lesson of love and religion and how sometimes love doesn't enter our lives with fireworks and excitement. Sometimes love just comes softly"
4,Good wholesome family film,"It's not just a chick flick, there are cowboy's in it too. If you like ""Little House on the Prairie"" series, you'll like this too."
2,Read the book,"I'm probably just a grouch, but I loved this book...and I'm sorry, this is NOT the same story. The names are the same...that's about all I can say. So if you are going to make a movie fine...but don't lie and says its based on this book. Its not and I liked the book better. I recommend going and reading the book and skipping the movie...unless you can deal with the fact that it has nothing to do with the book. By the way, the book is by Janette Oke - you can find it easily at any library to read."
3,"Clean, Predictable, but Disappointing","I probably should have seen this before I read the book series. There is so much more to Marty and Clark than what is shown in the movie, and the characters on screen seem so bland and two-dimensional. I missed the neighbors that Marty came to know, and how her interactions with them molded her into a different woman. I missed the tension between Marty and Clark as they learned to love each other. I missed Ma (even though she showed up twice).It's a nice, clean, wholesome movie that you should watch if you never intend to read the books. Once you delve into the pages of the world of Marty and Clark Davis, watching this portrayal will resemble eating cardboard - dry and lacking flavor.3 out of 5 stars for me."
5,Wonderful movie.,I never get tired of watching this movie. The main characters are so good. It is a very wonderful heart touching story.
3,Love Comes Softly,I found this to be a good movie but was not completely impressed with the changes that they made to the plot. It is hard for me to see Missie as a nine year old child in the first movie when the book had her as a baby of not yet two. Most of the changes were small but having read the books I was dissapointed in the changes they chose to make. I had dreamed of them making this into a movie and was just a little dissapointed that it was not more like the books. I am still looking forward to seeing the sequel.
4,"A great ,clean hallmark movie!","I have read Janette Oke's book Love Comes Softly, but i didn't like it as much as the movie. Its about a young girl whose husband dies when he falls off a horse. While she is still grieving another man comes and asks her to be his husband just so he would have a mother for his little girl. He promises to pay for her to go back East in the spring. She accepts knowing she needs a roof over her head before the cold winter arrives.This movie is a good, clean movie that every member of the family will enjoy.Funny at times, this movie will warm your heart."
2,Wholesome but not what it could have been,"The religous overtone was a bit too strong for me. An ok movie that could have been taken to a higher level. Marty's second husband was just too ""perfect""."
5,Good story about what is important in life. . .,"Title sums up the story very well. Would highly recommend. After watching it, I immediately looked for a sequel which I found and also recommend: ""Love's Enduring Promise."" Hopefully, more movies will be made as the author, Janette Oke, wrote eight books in this series. You enjoy the characters so much that you don't want the story to end."
5,Love Comes Softly,Loved the movie but I thought I was buying both of the movies in DVD and this one came in VHS. The sequel to LCSoftly came in DVD form but I was disappointed that LCS did not.
5,Finally a wholesome loving story,"It is so hard to find great movies with loving messages among the muck that is for sale out there. Well this movie and its sequels are all right up there. Your family will love them, from the kids to the adults. The Christian messages in them are what movies should be about. My teenage daughter loves them too."
4,...I'm a guy and I enjoyed it.,I have seen the others. This is the first so it's nice to see the beginning.Good clean story..values..romance etc. Family viewing.Katherine Heigl...looks great here...nice and wholesome without tons of makeup.I believe she appears in the first 2 of this series of six Video Oke's
3,Great series,If your looking for a series of dvds for those wintry nights this is one you will enjoy!
5,love comes softly,"this is one of the best movies ever, have watched over and over, no violence, and endearing...................love it.........looking for the one that came after this one, 2nd in series.haven't been able to find it yet."
3,sentiment and some Christian faith,Why do bad things happen to good people?This movie is a standard Hallmark tear jerkerabout love and loss and a healing with time.The lady is a bookish woman who has come to the frontierto make a new home only to lose her husband on the first day.A widower offers her a marriage of a winter for her teaching and companionshipfor his daughter.Something more blooms in the lonely winter months.
1,Bah!,"I might have liked this movie had I not been so into the book series. They ruined the story! Missie was portrayed as 8 instead of 1 (and a tomboy, when Missie turned out to be very feminine), Marty seemed a lot less like her character in the book, Ma Graham is not in the movie as much as she should be, and they felt the need to add dramatic things to the story, which really weren't necessary. The lost note from Marty to Clark, Clark walking in on Marty in the bath, Marty having her baby delivered by Clark instead of Ma Graham... just stupid annoying things like that. I couldn't even get myself through the other movies. The second one opens up with some dramatic scene... blah. Read the books! =)"
5,One of the best love stories...,I have waited a long time for this movie to come out on video. I saw this film on the Hallmark channel and fell in love! And so will you. This is a must have film for the whole family!!!
3,A wholesome movie lacking in depth,"My wife and family watched this movie tonight. The movie is very family friendly and had a nice plot. Unfortunately the movie strays from the original text and loses much of its flavor. It was very predictable and too hollywood. Otherwise, we enjoyed it. It was had a good message and was very family friendly. Wish more time was put into developing more realistic depth."
5,Quality family film! A great staple in my movie collection.,"The whole ""Love Comes Softly"" series is heart warming and inspiring. I would recommend any of these movies to anyone. Absolutely wonderful!!!Love Comes Softly"
5,My kind of entertainment,"This DVD was refreshing and heart warming! I happened upon as a rental in the video store. What a FIND! I watched it with my 13 yo son on a quiet weekend night and we BOTH enjoyed it! I would recommend this for any family. Where are more movies like this one? Congratulations Michael Landon, Jr.; you are a tribute to your father! - Katie Yates"
5,One of the Best Romantic Love Stories I've ever seen.,"I only seen the movie once and knew I had to own it. Now I see that part two of this romantic epic is coming out in February of 2005....and I can hardly wait. This story tells how a woman faces a tragic loss in a town where she knows no one. A gentle man provides her with a propositon and in exchange she gets a free train ticket to get back home. The question is does she take that one way ticket back home or does she fall in love with this gentle man in the process of their deal.? Watch and see! You won't be sorry.LOVE THIS MOVIE. Michael Landon, Jr. is following in his fathers steps."
5,First In A Series of A Family Settling In The Early West,"This first book in a series that follows a family moving west in early America, the hardships they endured, and the inner resolve they had to overcome obstacles and situations. A wonderful love story and picture of life as early Americans moved west. I gave this as a gift to a young couple, who really loved it."
3,Get the Book,It is not nearly as good as the book. It does not even follow the books plot except in a very general way. I was very disappointed in the movie.
3,pastel,"These erasable colored pencils are fun to work with, but their not like regular colored pencils. They are not very smooth when you draw with them, and they tend to skip. Some of the colors are a little more vibrant than others, but they produce pastel colors. They erase fairly well,but the black doesn't seem to come off as easily or completely as the other colors. If you're sketching and you want to erase the black go really light with your lines. The pencils are labeled by color and have their own erasers. There are enough colors in the 24 pack to cover the spectrum of skin tones. They come sharpened and have a nice long point.I use them to practice drawing skills. I bought them because they are erasable, and I wanted to experiment with them. I think they are good for adults and would be good for children."
2,erasable colored pencils,"These pencils were harder to color with than typical colored pencils. They stick to the paper rather than glide across it smoothly - very frustrating for younger artists, which doesn't make sense because it seems as though the ""erasables"" are targeted at younglings. they do, however, erase well. I returned them."
1,quit working 6 months later,speakers sounded great thought i got a good deal then six months later one of my speakers stopped working was very disappointed in product quality.
2,Disappointed,"I guess I shouldn't have expected a lot from speakers this cheap, but I am still pretty disappointed in the sound quality. I read all the reviews and thought I would give them a try. I should have listened to my gut telling me not to buy cheap no name speakers. For one thing, each speaker sounds fairly different, with one sounding more trebley and one more bassy. They do seem to have good clear high and mid range sound, but the bass response is terrible. The overall sound is very high pitched and tinny. I am going to replace them with some JBLs or Infinitys."
1,Boring!,"What a disappointment this CD is. Easy tempo should not be boring, but that's what I heard when I played this. Sorry."
2,wordy and boring,My husband and I love Dave. We took Financial Peace University and follow his plan for budgeting while paying off student loan debt and a car. I really wanted to love these books and was so excited to use them as a resource to teach our children about money. The lessons in stories are solid but they are just so wordy and the writing rambles on and on and on and on and on and on. It does not hold my attention much less my kids. Huge disappointment! :(
5,Great Life Lessons,Thanks for giving me material to use to teach my kids about saving and a good work ethic!
1,Too well built?,"This blade looks good on paper. The plate flatness is nearly perfect with unmeasureable runout. This may be part of the problem, because on my saw, it burns hardwoods (oak, mahogany, etc.) You can't push the piece through the saw fast enough to get a edge without a burn mark, an that is on both sides of the blade. Cut quality is very good, but plan on planing away the burn marks."
5,Great choice for a 2 year old on up,"My 2 year old just got this as a gift from his aunt, and he adores it. Not only does it fit and work with his Duplo blocks, but it is much easier for him to manipulate than his wooden Thomas set. He adores Thomas, and while I wish this set clearly stated that it is an add-on set (now I have to go and get him some more track!), he has had a lot of fun putting the trains together and pushing them under the bridge.I love the open, creative play - the fact that it doesn't make sounds, flash lights, or require batteries. He loves having a larger choo-choo that is easy for him to play with on his own. We will definately be getting more Thomas Duplo trains in the near future!"
4,"Good,But","My daughter loves anything dealing with Thomas, we have been collecting the trains and I just brought this James set first, but you do need the Thomas set to really be able to run the trains around correctly otherwise it really doesnt hold any appeal... My daughter told me that we needed more tracks when she first got it. As soon as i went and brought the Thomas set she played with it notstop. I love da fact that is is so easy for her to put together and away without my help... Makes her feel like a big girl."
4,Lego Thomas & Friends James at Knapford Station 5552,"Thomas & Friends is enjoyed by both boys and girls. Also in our experience, ages from 2 1/2 to 6."
1,When ecology was called eugenics,"I read many parts of this short and bad book, here in Brazil.This book, wyth just about 70 pages has a general introduction and four chapters.The introduction was made by a reverend, called James Marchant.The chapter II - ""The problems of today"" has some informations , about author's eugenics in his times.Today, Eugenics got a new name:ecology.The racism remais there, but with a green mask."
2,taojoker,They are not kidding when they say you need a sifu and this is only a suplemental tool. For $50 I expected a ton more than what was offered. You are better off putting your money into extra class time with a certified instructor. I would not recomend this item unless your sifu has specificly told you to get it.
1,Terrible product,"I have a Motorola 6400 radio. When I received this headset I followed the instructions as to how to plug it in, including turning off the radio first. This headset overrides the VOX and keeps it on continuously. I am not able to turn off the VOX when the headset is in even though I turn off the VOX prior to plugging in the headset. When it's plugged in, the VOX control does not display at all, leaving it inaccessible. It also ""hot-mike's"" and causes high pitched noise. I required a headset for my work in the Army in Iraq and this one does not meet advertised expectations. I cannot use it at all."
4,Very Talented Musician,I've always Dug Lee Tienour's tone on Guitar. he has a Signature sound&tone that is showcased really strongly on this Collection. He is a very Versatile Musician&that works really well.his work has been showcased on alot of artists work over the years. this is a very good collection.
4,One of the few books for kids adopted at older ages,"There is such a need for books that are applicable to families that adopt children beyond infancy. It is a shame that this is out of print. I was able to find it at the library, though."
5,Insightful analysis on Oppression in America.,"George Jackson, a man imprisoned for robbery at a young age and given one year to life in the penal system. Self educated in jail by the works of Marx, Fanon, Mao, Che and many other revolutionary intellectuals. Powerful comments on Urban Guerrilla Warfare. A must read for anyone grappling with the question of How? How can we strike a blow at the Oppressors, read this book you will glean ideas, what you do with them is on you. peace!"
2,Mythology,"To place this book in perspective, it should be read with ""The Rise and Fall of California's Radical Prison Movement"" which gives a more accurate and less flattering portrait of Jackson as a petty hustler and con-artist. There are no subtle insights here, just overheated and dated rhetoric about ""the fascist beast"" and ""Amerikkka."" Prisons are not hotbeds of potential anti-capitalism but where the worse aspects of present day society are leached into their most destructive and poisonous forms. Only in exceptional circumstances, like Attica, do these circumstances get overturned.As Max Stirner pointed out more than a century and a half ago, criminals are those most dominated by spooks; even as they break laws, they worship property because they want to make it their own, a more profound insight whose validity anyone who spends any real time around petty street criminals can testify to."
3,Interesting polemic,"I have not read this book yet, but it seems to be an interesting propaganda piece (in the original sense of the word) by somebody serving an unjust sentence.Nowadays, with Three Srikes and you're Out in CA, this is being repeated no doubt.My objection to this book (why it's not 5 stars) is that it appears to be a derivative work by somebody who studied the original leftist agitators.Also, this book is likely to be admired by prison radicals who actually do not mind being labeled evil. By that I mean prison gang diciples. This is the modern 21st century trend--in other words, people who do not care for a reconcilation with their oppressors, but relish the opportunity to make trouble."
1,Worthless Junk,"I read the previous reviews, and thought I could overcome the problems that were listed by them. I was painfully wrong. The picture makes it look like it was designed for precision alignment, but the reality is that it's made from cheap plastic, and the clamp will not hold your chisel square, or keep it from moving when you start sharpening. Don't waste your money like I did."
4,But in the end...,"It pains me to enjoy an album that so blatantly rips-off Nirvana (c.i.p. the chorus to ""Mother May I"" and they sound like a less punky version throughout), but this is an undeniably good album. Listening to the lyrics and well-crafted musicianship, it's surprising how hard they are. Their material is also refreshing from the glut of love/relationships songs out there, though the oddly-named songs pertain naturally. Could've done without the ""cats & dogs"", ""pigs & hogs"" rain rhyme, though."
5,"Great Band, Great Album","I remember seeing these guys regularly at Pelican's retreat. There's a definite Beatles and ""Grung"" quality to their music, but they definitely have their own sound. The best part was, they knew how to write a good song! Awsome three way harmonies and dual guitars. This album doesn't do justice to their live sound and their stage presence. My favorties are ""Mr. Green"", ""Mother May I"", ""Last Man on Earth"" and ""Bulldozer"". I regret that they never released the song ""17"" which had a kick [butt], unique opening riff. Oh, well."
3,I knew them when....,"I remember going to see the Seeds at Pelican's and Montana's. Both of those places are gone now but as I knew then, the guys wouldn't be. The stage show was always fantastic and the music superb. I even had them autograph a check for me because I knew they'd be famous!!This CD is fantastic - Quicksand is my favorite - I've loved every song from the beginning. Way to go guys!!"
3,Just a quick clarification,"Bringin' on the Heartbreak is actually off of Def Leppard's ""High 'n' Dry"" album which was released in 1981 and again in 1984 with additional songs in the US.I'm curious to hear Mariah Carey's version of this. I used to be a big Def Leppard fan! Since I haven't heard it yet and I must give it a rating before I can submit my comments, I'll rate it an average 3 stars."
1,This is a remake people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,People need to get their head examined. This is a song by Def Leppard off the Pyromania album in the mid 80's. The song is supposed to be bold and exploding with emotion. Not whispered like you want to keep your Mommy from hearing it. Do a favor and get The Rock Of Ages greatest hits CD by Def Leppard or Pyromania and heart how it should be sung...with soul.
5,Gypsy... sittin' lookin' pretty...,"""Bringin' On The Heartbreak"", is my fave of all Mariah's songs. When I bought her album ""Charmbracelet"", I knew it was the standout all throughout the album, almost the last track and it's filthy great. The song is so mysterious and haunting with a very interesting video in which she plays a gypsy and fits her well. It is a revival, and it's even better than the original. I don't have the single but have heard all the tracks in the single and fell in love with it. Not a big fan of Carey, but this song tells my personality... gypsy... gypsy... the song rocks!!! get it!"
4,A Terrifc Giallo,"This stylish Italian murder mystery (giallo) from 1970 is surprisingly good. As a whole it doesn't surpass the mastery of an Argento or Bava film but it comes close. In fact, the stalking in the Vienna park in STRANGE VICE predates a similar sequence in Argento's FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET by two years and is quite scarier. There are some stunning images, a beautiful score, smatterings of nudity and gore and a crazy plot that actually caught me off-guard and had me guessing to the end. Edwige Fenech is excellent as Mrs. Wardh although the script should have indulged us with more of her vices and a psychological reasoning behind them. Those quibbles aside, this is a giallo that stands heads above others such as the ludicrous CRIMES OF THE BLACK CAT or SEVEN BLOOD-STAINED ORCHIDS."
3,worth a look,"A solid, well-crafted giallo that delivers the goods without achieving 'classic' status. Despite the title - and the opening quote from Freud - the film has minimal interest in character psychology. In fact, Mrs Wardh's vice is little more than a plot device, though the weirdly-scored slow-motion flashbacks are certainly memorable. The characters are interesting without being in any way sympathetic. The men are manipulative predators and the women play dangerous games. In the last act, the sado-masochistic undercurrents make way for a series of plot twists. While these are not too predictable, the final 'solution' is unremarkable. Sergio Martino stages some impressive set-pieces, aided by editor Eugenio Alabiso, whose credits include FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. While Martino lacks the artistry of Bava or Argento, he certainly knows how to make a movie."
3,"Not completely satisfied, on the first try.","I ordered a bouquet for Mother's day 2012. Sadly when they arrived, my mother sent me a text message saying they were pretty but that 6 or the 8 Irises were broken just below the bud. I contacted them through Amazon and was please that they offered to send a replacement bouquet. The second one arrived in a few days and was in perfect condition.I really appreciated their customer service, it was done mostly through email and they certainly made the situation better. I would try them again, but perhaps not for such a busy floral holiday."
4,long-lasting,The bouquets last a long time if given the proper care. I also add water at intervals even if the instructions don't say so and are lovely. Kay
1,"Ugh, I'm never going to buy Proflowers again","I would seriously warn anyone against buying flowers from this company. There products, service and prices come no where close to matching companies like FTD. The company is a nightmare.Save your money."
5,Beautiful,My mom got these and they were so beautiful and alot got the price. They were roses and my mom loved them!
1,Lost a customer,"I've actually used ProFlowers before, but I won't be any longer due to their ongoing support for Limbaugh. What girl would want flowers from a company who supports this guy?"
4,Vase too tall,"According to the recipient, the flowers were lovely multicolored stems of roses. The downside was that the included vase was a little too tall and didn't let the flowers spread out. She said she only cut an inch off the stems but that the vase would have been too tall even if she hadn't trimmed anything."
2,"late delivery, hidden charges, then lots of marketing emails","What seemed like a great deal on the first web click, but got worse every screen. At least four screens popped up, each with an additional charge for ""shipping & handling"" that needed to be applied. These all added up to no deal at all; yet every screen kept reminding me I was getting the ""deluxe"" vase for ""free"". $8 extra to get flowers ""delivered the day after tomorrow"" ? To add insult to injury, the flowers arrived late and clearly had been sent long distance. Embarrassed how bad the flowers looked."
2,General Tools 29 Plastic Protractor - Not great,"I agree with ""You get what you pay for"". You have to be fiddle just to make sure the arms are flush against your workpiece, and then spend time second-guessing the reading that you see. The size of this protractor is convenient, and it's easy to adapt from inner to outer angles, but again, it's just too cheap to be used for serious woodworking. After 12 cuts trying to achieve a perfect 30 degree angle, I'm going to look for something a little more (hopefully a LOT more) reliable, and pay the $ for it!"
1,"inaccurate, sloppy","You get what you pay for: there is way too much slop to make accurate measurements with this tool. Even after locking the tool with the thumbscrew, there were several degrees of slop."
1,This item is inaccurate,"I was very disappointed with this item. I am working on crown molding and thought I would save a few bucks. When I checked this unit against 2 know 90 degree set squares, it was off by 2 degrees. Its essentially useless.I should probably have spent more and got a more professional unit. I'm sending it back, but after postage I'll probably net very little as a refund."
4,"Accurate, inexpensive, easy to use!","We use these tools on several benches in our professional wood working shop and found them to be very accurate. Naturally, like the rest of our equipment we check for proper calibration often."
2,horrific smell,"Excited to buy this product, tried it once on myself and on the kids. Unfortunately, the smell is truly horrific. It smells as if someone vomitted up lemons. Seriously. Kids were gagging. Does not even come off with water, needed to take showers. Threw away the 2 bottles I bought."
2,Tastes awful,"My experience appears to be different than that of most other reviewers. While Bite Blocker may keep the bugs at bay, it smells rancid and leaves a lingering taste in one's mouth for hours. Two of us in our home used the product and had similar results. Our experience with Cutter Advanced with picaridin is much better. No smell, no taste and it keeps the bugs off."
5,Excellent & Natual Product,I love this product ... I live in the woods & to sit outside was just about impossible. Other bug spray's fragrance bothered my allergies. This product not only repels the bugs but it softens your skin. The fragrance is light & natural. Have told everyone about it. My friends love the children's version too.
5,music of the far off future,"Three virtual unknowns in the comercial music world can play batter than anyone on earth. Jeff Sipe has the chops of a recently released mental patient. His speed and musicality across the drum set make him one of the best Ive ever heard. Shawn Lane must be seen in order to be believed. Lane has the ability to outplay anyone in his field, and Jonas Helbourg holds down the group with mood setting basslines and killer slap lines. Listen to track six to hear the sickest chops on the market. These are world class musicians."
4,Shawn Lane tears it up!,"I am a huge Shawn Lane fan which is why I got this CD. It is not as good as his ""Powers of Ten"" which unfortunately is out of print, but it is good. My main complaint is Hellborg's bass tone and overplaying. If you like heavy progressive music with ripping guitar, this is for you. Few guitarists can keep up with Lane. He not only can ""shred,"" but he knows his music and has creativity (and sensitivity) for days."
5,this is awsome,"I don't have to say a lot. Shawn Lane is awesome. However, He must be seen to be believed. I have seen him live in Memphis. Trust me, even though you don't know me, this cd is worth every penny."
5,Easy to Understand and Follow,"This book is easy to understand and will make you second guess whether or not War is always the answer. As a student this book helped make reading easy and allowed me to understand some of the deeper and more involved concepts. You won't find yourself bored or struggling to get through the pages. The book flows so well from one chapter to another. As a student I must say this isn't my particular field of interest, yet I had to read the entire book and I am glad I did. This book opened my eyes to war and the Christian Conscience. I believe this book can make even the most pro-war advocates consider other options and methods to solve disputes. Dr. Fahey is brilliant. Just as a side note, his personal demeanor is as gentle and kind as the underlying message behind his book."
4,Good/ cheaper alternative to water cooled RAM.,"Does what it is supposed to, only problem I have is after about 3 days one of the fans developed a hum when turned up. Kind of an expensive set to be humming already... Coulda rigged a 120mm in the case blowing at the RAM for less and would have been much quieter. I give it a 4 just because I think for the price it should have been much longer b4 it developed any noise."
1,Worst every week,"This is mine experience with this fan: first week a nice product, second week so noisy, third week fans roar for a seconds, now this fans roar for two or three minutes after PC starts and then vibrate all the time."
2,Did I really need it?,"Nope, didn't really need it but it looked cool. Ran well for about 6 months but now one of the fans is sticking and is making a humming noise"
1,junk dont bother,Lasted for 2 days then broke. Was replaced by amazon promptly. Second fan broke 2 weeks later. This fan really makes a lot of noise and doesn't work so avoid buying
2,Fan Problems,"Well, its been about 8 months. I got a CPU fan error message at boot one day, so I open up the case, and low and behold, my Coolermaster V8 fan is dead after less than 3000 hours . Same time, I notice my Corsair memory cooler with three fans has issues. Middle fan is spinning at variable speeds from slow to medium, sporadically, and bottom fan is making an annoying intermittant buzz due to intermittant vibration. Thats two of three fans with problems in less than 8 months. Cant find warranty info anywhere, although I see tiger direct inplies that this product has a ""limited"" lifetime warranty. However, they want you to send a self addressed stamped envelope for the warranty. How clever. Simply a pain in the A to jump thorugh those hoops. Now, I laso boutg 12G of dominator sticks and a 1000w modular PS when I built my rig. I am having probllems with fans , 4 of them in less than a year, from ccooler master and corsair."
5,MUY BUENO,"Muy buena solucion para enfriar las memorias, es verdad que suena un poco, pero a quien le va a importar eso si estas jugando en tu pc con un buen sistema de audio, lo menos que vas a escuchar es el ruido del fan,lo que importa es que cumple muy bien con su trabajo, lo recomiendo!!"
5,Speaking for those who cannot . . . . says it all!,"There are no words to fully describe the depth of this book's scope in such relevant context of shelter work! The writing is excellent, the overall aura and ambience provides insight, inspiration and aspiration toward the goals encompassed in these stories! Every individual encounter in this volume will capture your emotions with hope and a desire to be a part of similar endeavors!"
1,Didn't work,The description of this product sounded promising but it does not work as advertised. I applied it and have allowed various amounts of time for it to dry. It always makes my razor grab/tug on the skin instead of gliding like it is supposed to. I have used other products that have allowed my razor to glide but was looking for something without alcohol. IMHO this product is over priced and doesn't work as advertised.
1,worse than nothing,"I generally like Billy Jealousy products, and got a sample of Lightning Bolt along with a purchase of other (better) products. Unfortunately, Lightning Bolt is a complete disappointment -- worse than using nothing at all. I use a Braun shaver. When using Lightning Bolt, there is no change in shave closeness or irritation. But there's a huge increase in facial stickiness, which makes shaving slow and annoying. Don't waste your money on this stuff."
1,Makes your shave more difficult,"I was looking for a product without alcohol, and I am already used to the quality of the Billy Jealousy Shaved Ice After-Shave which is a great product. This solution unfortunately causes your razor to get caught on your skin and you must force it to move, causing irritation. This also causes the shave to be less close. Back to the Lectric Shave for now - it's unfortunate that Billy Jealousy did not deliver with this product."
5,Very impressed.,"I purchased this after a recommendation from a co-worker. Normally just did the occasional dry, electric shave. After using this product I was genuinely impressed as I did not have to perform a touch up buzz 4 hours later, as is the norm.If you use an electric shaver, try this out."
4,"Good art, great story.","For those of you unsure who William Messner-Loebs is, he's the guy who wrote all that swell dialogue for the first few years of Kieth's inexplicably non-award-winning series THE MAXX (no, I did not misspell ""Kieth""). I originally hunted down and bought EPICURUS for Sam's art, but the writing threatened to overshadow the art at times... which is not to say that the art is sub-par, but rather that the story, although a tad uneven, is almost funny and engaging enough to make one forget how good the art is. Political satire tends to age quickly, but EPICURUS THE SAGE is one of those works that manages to remain timeless by not getting overly topical."
2,Overrated,This movie is very overrated. There are a few funny parts but not much. You have to sit through 15 minutes of nothing to get to a funny part.
5,A Must Read!!!,"This book was excellent! Every pastor, prayer minister, and church leader needs to read this book. Hurting people are coming into our churches looking for help. If we do not know how to help them they will turn, drugs, alcohol, or the occult. This book has answers. I encourage those loving Christians considering spiritual adoption to consider carefully the commitment they are about to make. It is so needed! However it is a life long commitment. If you tell someone you will be a spiritual parent to them and then change your mind because it turned out to be more of a commitment than you anticipated, you will damage that person as badly or perhaps worse that the abuse they are trying to recover from. Everyone should read this book."
1,WRONG-O!!!,"About 3 months ago, I tried out the idea of Satanism. Why? It sure wasn't any of the reasons expresed in the book. I bought it afterwards to see if he was ""on-target"", but he wasn't, of course. The only people who can understand Satanists are the Satanists themselves. anyone else trying to do so is a fraud.If you're trying to save someone from Satanism, get a Chicken Soup book. save this for when there's nothing left to read on your bookshelf."
5,Spiderman Spiderman What a Concept Spiderman,"This review I am doing with the assistance of my 10 yr old... This game is great. The only bad point is camera control is non-existant. You can only look where they let you. The graphics and scenery is stunning and the villians rock. The best thing about this game is that the 2nd player can come in and out as they please. Meaning, if little brother begs to play and then gets bored with it, you don't have to reset the game. Just let him opt out on the pause screen and you are back to the game.My son has completed the game twice and keeps playing it, He usually finishes a game and it is back to the video store, but not this one. Highly recommend for kids and adults that love Spider-Man and his Villians."
1,Game Problems,This did not meet my expectations because the game did not work! Every time I started to play it would freeze.
2,if you're into fighting...,"that's pretty much the majority of the game - fighting. I just wish the game creators would get a bit more creative. Sure, Spider-Man is a superhero who fights evil, but Spider-Man is also a character with an incredible set of skills one could apply toward problem solving challenges. Yes, this is a mother talking. My 9-year old loves Spider-Man. Is it so hard to put just a bit more role-model type stuff into these games? That doesn't mean it's not going to be ""cool"" anymore.Not far into the game, the bosses become a bit ridiculous to beat where it's not a matter of skill but a matter of how long can your hands manage from totally cramping up because you've performed the same moves for ten minutes straight now. To me, that's lazy programming. Let's just crank out these games... kids are mindless anyway and won't notice it's the same violent crap just wrapped in a different package over and over again.The graphics are great. And if you're into mindless stuff, this should do."
4,Spider-man Friend or Foe for PS2,"Promises met when dealing with Amazon and partners. Son loves this game, so it lived up to expectations."
1,2007 has not been good to Peter Parker,"First there was the colossal train wreck that was Spider-Man 3, and now there's this, Spider-Man: Friend or Foe; nothing but a bad attempt to cash in on the semi-popularity of the Legends games.You get one partner, one, that's it. So, if you get tired of doing the same moves over & over again with Spider-Man, hey, switch on over to the Prowler, or better yet Black Cat, good golly.The voice acting sucks something fierce and I don't think you even possess the ability to control the camera, which is fantastic.I played this to play as the villains, which I did get to do, briefly playing, eventually to my disdain, as Doctor Octopus, but the game's massive amount of monotony just lead me to stop playing after about half an hour.Here's a tip; just make a Legends type game with the villains as the main characters, no good guys, just villains, and maybe it won't be as huge of a disappointment as this (or Ultimate Spider-Man).Pass."
3,"Total deception, tracks are not digitalized or remasterized,","The selection of tracks is excellent. Even though you can get these titles from many other compilations, there are a few tracks that are unique to ""Dance Machine '91 `92"", and those were the ones why I bought this expensive CD. Surprisingly, when I heard the 1st track I new I was ripped. The tracks are not remasterized or digitalized, most of the cases even though the songs were originally available on CD format, all the tracks are recorded from their 12inch vinyl format and you can clearly hear the horrible scratches all over the songs. I'm totally disappointed and I feel ripped since the compilation is expensive and does not have the quality I expected. It deserves zero stars but I gave 3 stars considering that music and artists selected are more than excellent."
3,Delivery,"I can see there's a number of good reviews. Sure, the author knows what he's talking about. And what he talks about- matters. But if you are put off by bad writing, do not buy this book. I'm surprised that this distinguished M.D. can't write cohesively; he uses run-off paragraphs, unnecessary ""...and...s"" and all kinds of bad stuff.It is an exhausting read, and not in the good way."
1,Beware of how they ship your items!,"I never received it. They cancelled my order, and refunded my money. They said they needed a signature for delivery. I was never informed of this when they shipped it out, subsequently noone was home to sign for it. Dumb. I wish they would've told me and I could've asked them to deliver with ""no signature required"". Oh well."

3,"Nice music, would like to try recipes","I didn't mind this compilation at all. The music is fine, in fact, I rather enjoyed it. I'd like to try the recipes and perhaps a party based on this CD."
3,"The original was trash, but......","The original ""Sweet Sweetback,"" in my opinion, was nothing but a trashy prono flick masquerading as revolutionary mumbo-jumbo that appealed to the confusion of the times and nothing to celebrate. However, if you've seen that mess, then this would make sense to you. Good look on a historical level at the making of that piece of junk that brought on the nauseous wave of Black exploitation films and the overall confused thinking of that era. It's kind of odd to see Bill Cosby, given his recent denigration of the underside of Black culture, at the end of this film praising this. Makes you wanna say WHAAT?"
4,Very Good Film,"Props to Mario Van Peebles for telling His father's Stor through all the Struggles,Racism,Negativity&whatnot that went with Making this Classic Independent Film.nowadays Indy films are cool&Happening but back in the day it was a true risk&especially for a Black Man trying to call His own Shots.Props to the Whole cast for having patiences&Believing in Melvin Van Peebles Dream&vision. a true team effort.Earth,Wind&Fire getting a Hook up.that is interesting that a then unknown Band would get to make History with this film. the dynamic of Father&Son is truly something else. it truly captures the time period really well. you also get the Complexity of Melvin Van Peebles in this film as well.the extra features were cool.how the film started out &Grossing 15 Million Dollars was incredible.History lesson.Nia Long was on Point as well.the Whole Cast was Good&this should be required viewing for any Indy Film Maker."
3,Score Reading Book,"As a Composition and Conducting major, it's a nice, well-written book which reveals a way how to you read a score while listening to it. For real Score Reading purposes (""hacking the Orchestral Score on the piano), I wouldn't recommend it so much because although it consists of excerpts, it's not practical enough because of the format. Probably di Lassus, Bach Chorales and later the ""Kunst der Fuge"" are still the best way to improve your reading of the clefs before you can start reading a full score using the clefs for the transposition. For everybody who's not a conducting major, it could be a very useful book as an introduction to score reading or actually score listening"
5,A real gem of an album ~ fun,"Hope everyone is doing well. This is a cut above what you would expect.. very musical (funky tracks, rockers, anthems, reefer madness, etc.). You'll probably listen to it more than once, for sure dude/dudess!"
5,Malice in wonderland,The costume can be paired with anything to suit your own style and the costume. It is well made and even the checkered nylons with it are out of this world. The black and white costume is nice compared to the typical blue and white of most Alice cotumes found now. I would personaly recommend frilly undergarments for beneth the skirt to give it a fluffier almost doll appeal. Accented with maryjanes and pale foundation give it a gothic lolita sort of look as well. I myself am still attempting to find a flop eared bunny to remind people of who I am suppose to be. Its fun to work with but you may need a few more accesories as to remind peole of who you are as well.
3,Could be MUCH better,"The item arrived well ahead of it's delivery schedule. Unfortunately, the plastic cover was broken. It was replaced promptly with another broken plastic cover. After another call to customer service, that one too was replaced (customer service was excellent). The plow lift was not what was expected. The winch mounted easily, the handle had to have the paint scrapped off of it so that it would fit into it's designated location. The adjustment turnbuckle on the winch cable assembly pulled apart after 2 uses. The turnbuckle is probably one of the cheapest made and is too light weight for this application. I replaced it with a quality one. I hope the rest of the cable assembly holds up!! For nearly $100 I had expected something a little bit higher in quality than what I received. The winch does work fine and is a great option for somebody that doesn't want to install an electric winch."
2,half a book,"I recently purchased this book along with the set of cassettes. It turns out, however, that the book is only part II of the complete course. This isn't mentioned anywhere in the course description. The cassettes, however, cover the complete course, so that only the last three cassettes correspond to part II. In order to make use of the course and all the cassettes, you'd have to purchase the teacher's manual, which isn't available on amazon.com. Otherwise, the course looks to quite good."
3,Be forewarned,"This is a set of ten tapes. All are professionally done, but only the last three match the dialogue from the book. That means you better have a good background in colloquial Arabic (or be in a class) to make use of the first seven tapes.They all have solid material--ranging from simple phrases to detailed conversations. Each tape features oral exams that test listening comprehension.The only thing that prevents me from giving it a higher rating is a lack of a transcript for the first seven tapes. Some people might also wonder why this wasn't released in CD format.I did find these tapes useful preparation for travels in Syria."
4,give her a chance,"The girly voice thing sometimes plagues old Nanci Griffith work as well, but both artists have a lot more to say than their voices suggest. I highly suggest you find whatever local coffeehouse or intimate setting is featuring Stacy Earle. Their set was one of the most unusual, intimate, and intense experiences you may have. Stacy invited the audience to come around the corner to the piano, and stand with her while she sang ""The Note."" She thanks her audience with hugs. She's in your face when she sings about almost losing her son in an accident. Then listening to her album will make sense, girly voice and all."
3,A Decent Intro Guide,"The book was interesting for somebody wanting to learn and become familiar with canyoneering and dessert hiking. However, in terms of providing practical data on good hikes, it is far behind any of Steve Allen's books. If you're new to this, then buy this and Steve's. If you've been there and done this, no need to reread the basics."
5,A thorough guide to canyon exploration.,"The canyons of North America are among the most spectacular in the world, providing unlimited opportunities for hikers, photographers, climbers, and other modern day adventurers. John Annerino offers a thorough guide to the fundamentals of safe and well prepared canyon exploration. The natural history and earth science of canyon country, as well as expedition conditioning, preperation, and equipment are discussed in detail, as are potential hazards and how to avoid them. -The Adventurous Traveler"
1,Lacking substance,"If you know ABSOLUTELY nothing about canyoneering this book may be of interest to you. Don't waste your money, buy ANY other book about canyoneering. This one is complete fluff."
5,Perfect for a single bedroom,"This is perfect for a single bedroom... like a baby or kid's room. I set it on the lowest setting and run it all night and it increases the humidity in my baby's room (door shut) from 35% to 50+%. I end up turning it off if I go in there in the early morning hours to keep it from getting too humid (60%). There's water left over even if I run it all night on low. It's super quiet in my opinion, but that's not really a concern for us anyway since we run a white noise maker in his room, too. It took longer than the instructions said for it to warm up. I'm hesitant to buy one for my bedroom since we sleep with the door open and our room is much larger than my son's. I'm not sure, given it's size, it will be as effective."
2,Already broken,"I purchased this humidifier for my baby girl's bedroom. At first it was working fine, though I would sometimes find the carpet to be wet, even when I had it on a low setting. After gently cleaning it one day, it stopped working. I had it for only 4 months and it's already broken. Would have given it a pretty good rating but for the price, it should have lasted longer than four months!"
1,"Worked great first 2 months, and then it died!","Quiet and sleek design. I loved it for 2 months. Then I loaned it to a friend at work and she says it didn't turn on. I got it back and it didn't turn on. We were careful to make sure there was water in the unit prior to plugging it in and activating the unit; we followed the instruction manual. We are engineers!!I am past my return period. If you do buy it, be super gentle on this unit. I don't think it's built tough or ready to withstand moving it around too much?? Maybe my colleague did something, who knows!!UPDATE: I contacted the seller two weeks ago for advice and they have not written back. Not even a word. The seller will not stand behind this product, so be very careful with it or buy from a different seller."
5,Love it! Love it!,"After purchasing and returning a different brand of warm/cool mist humidifier because, contrary to the advertisment showing the uint in a bedroom setting, we discovered it was very loud. Much too loud for our 2-year old's room and too loud for our bedroom. Later we took a chance on an Ultrasonic and we love it.It's super quiet and very efficient."
2,Broken after 3 months,This unit quit working after 3 months. It is still under warranty but it cost me $25 to pack and ship it back.
1,Defective - wasn't happy with design anyway,"After unpacking this unit, I was immediately unhappy with how it is designed. The unit seems poorly made, and was clearly brought to the US as an afterthought. For example, the markings on the machine are mostly in Chinese characters with only English added here and there.The unit is somewhat of a pain to move around. The seal on the water tank is indeed leaky on my unit, however it is a very slow leak that would probably never cause a problem. It could be controlled by lessening the tightness of the filler cap as others have reported.My unit was defective ... Within an hour, I was still not getting steam even though there were glug-glug sounds. I lifted the water tank and found that the yellow balls/caplets that are part of the filter had come out of the filter and piled up in the water tray.Due to the cheap construction, odd design, and defective unit I will return this and not ask for a replacement. I recommend that you look at a different unit."
4,Very nice humidifier overall,"I've owened this for a bit over a month. It works as advertised and is quite compact and convenient-easy to transfer from room to room. My only issues are that it only holds a gallon of water, doesn't have an auto shut off, and that it is virtually impossible not to spill some water when removing and replacing the tank when refilling...my advice is refill it over a sink or tub. Other than that it works as well as anyother humidifier I've owned and is VERY quiet."
1,White dust,"The humidifier is easy to set up, and works well, EXCEPT it puts out a lot of white dust that coats everything. I did not realize when I bought it that it was that kind of vaporizer, or I wouldn't have bought it. I called the company and they said to use distilled water which would get expensive. Consumer Reports rated it well, and I was guided by that. I would NOT buy it again."
3,"Works well, but it is VERY small capacity","This won't make it thru the night if it's dialed to max or even slightly below max. It works well, with a nice mist (I wouldn't say it gets warm though) and is simple in concept to refill. I have somehow broken my nails several times trying to unscrew the filter to fill and I even leave it loose. I put off refilling it each night because it frustrates me everytime."
3,There Could Be Better Ones,"I purchased this humidifier about two years ago. It does put out a decent amount of cool mist, but the unit has recently become very noisy. I am unable to open up the unit to determine the cause of the noise, so to be on the safe side I've decided to trash it. I expected the unit to last longer than two years.This humidifier is also very messy when refilling the tank because water collects on the bottom of the tank and drips all over when removed from the reservoir. It is also more difficult to clean (I bleach once a week to kill bacteria/mold) compared to the Vicks model that I own."
5,Works great,"We purchased this for my 18 month old daughters room. It's really quiet to the point that if I didn't see the steam coming out I would think it was off! We keep it on the low setting, as her room is very small, and the water lasts for over 12 hours. We've only used it on the warm setting so far."
3,Steam setting 2 degrees difference.,"The warm mist setting is really only 2 degrees difference from the cold degrees setting. The directions read ""Do not touch the steam vapor. Steam can cause burns. But, 2 degrees warmer than the cold setting is not a detectable difference. Do not worry about the steam vapor burning you. The steam vapor feels cold on this unit. I called the maker and they gave me the 2 degree number."
5,"Best Humidifier, Ever!","We have owned several humidifiers, for our home, and for our yoga studio. We love this one because of:1. It's narrow, geometric shape which fits anywhere. Odd-shaped ones are always hard to fit neatly on shelves or in nooks.2. Adjustable low/high output of warm or cool mist.3. The built in filter is great.4. Very silent running.5. Great price.Compared to literally 12 other models that we have tried, this one wins, hands down. A night light hat could be turned off would be nice, but is not required."
1,Just Plain Did Not Work,"I don't review a lot of products, but I felt compelled to share my bad experience with this humidifier:1. It leaked within the first week2. The warm mist is not remotely warm3. Lastly, within the first week, the humidifier would not work, and the red light to add more water would not go off.I had a perfectly good Air-O-Swiss humidifier, but it did not have warm mist. So, I thought to trade-up, which was a tremendous mistake. I have bought dozens of products from Amazon, and this was the single worst, the only one I felt that I needed to share my experience. I would advise everyone DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
2,Worked great...at first...,"I've had this unit for a year now. At first it was amazing. It produced a thick cloud of vapor and was whisper quiet. But after a couple of weeks it began to hum fairly loud. I had to turn on a fan to cover up that noise, as it was a little annoying when I was trying to sleep.Today it basically died on me. It will not produce any vapor and just hums and gets unusually warm. I've just contacted SPT but they have no online support, which is frustrating. I'm hoping to hear back from them soon. If I don't, or if the unit can't be fixed, I will not by another."
1,short-lived functional period,"After I bought it, it worked very well for about three months, then stopped working. The engine would be humming, but no steam was produced."
2,I have a few problems with this unit,I have used humidifiers for years. I bought this one because of the reviews I read. The problems I have with it are the following:1) Perhaps the biggest problem is the unit puts out alot of steam and the floor is constantly wet (to the point of my socks getting wet) even though the unit is sitting on a step stool.2) The steam never seems to get warm even though I have it set on the warm setting3) This is the 2nd unit I have had. The 1st unit broke after 2 hours. I had no problem returning it and getting a replacement.It is very easy to clean and to fill. I do like that about it. Wish it worked more like I wanted it to.
1,Defective Product,"This is my second humidifier of this kind. I bought the first six months ago and it has worked well to date. Unfortunately the second, the unit in question, was defective straight out of the box. There is a knob on the side of the unit that controls the amount of humid air being produced. In this case, it's as though the knob were set on ""high"" even when the opposite is the case. In other words, the product runs on high continuously. I haven't returned it for replacement or repair because I've been much too focused on some personal health issues to be bothered, and because of course I discarded the shipping box before I discovered the problem. So be advised: It's a good humidifier when it works. Just be sure to put it through it paces first, as I should have done. I was careless."
1,Only able to feel a cool mist,"I may have received a defective product but this did not work as promised. I tried adjusting the dials, I tried using different types of water (spring, distilled, and sink), I tried everything but it only produced a cool mist that burned my nose. My son has terrible allergies and I purchase this in order to help him sleep a night. This item was a waste of time - it blew the mist to the ground instead of into the air. I also was not a fan of the fact that I was going to have to buy a new Ion Exchange Filter every couple of months (I believe it is every 3 or 6 months - please verify the duration of time). I returned this one and went with another that has worked fantastically."
3,No Warm Mist,"I purchased this as my grand-daughter has issues breathing when she visits, I think due to our gas heat. The unit is good, works well, nice & quiet with lots of mist coming out, just no warm mist at all, can't tell the difference between warm / cool. I use it in the living room -- medium size and the output is good and you can tell a difference.I spent some time researching before deciding on this particular unit and thought I had made the right choice, but I think I'm going to have to save this for the warmer months and purchase another that really puts out some warm mist, I will not however, return this as it does work very well, just not exactlly what I wanted."
1,Really misrepresnted,"This is by far the worse humidifier I have encountered. Not only is it extremely noisy, it produces some sort of vapor that clings to every surface. I have to dust all the surfaces such as TV screens, printers, other electronic gear, sides of cabinets and tables. I tried to contact their customer service and they refuse to respond. Obviously I used it beyond the Amazon 30 day return, thinking it could be something that would clear up. Not so. I removed the ION filter. No difference. The noise is a continuous dripping, like a defective faucet, and a loud gurgling noise every few seconds. I suggest you think twice before purchasing one of these."
1,I ordered 2 but 1 of them doesn't work.,I ordered 2 but 1 of them doesn't work upon arrival.SPT SU-4010 Ultrasonic Dual-Mist Warm/Cool Humidifier with Ion Exchange Filter
3,So-so product,"I bought this humidifier after doing a lot of research. I wanted quiet, efficient, reliable. It is quiet. It stopped working one month after purchasing. I tried cleaning the ultrasonic element with no success. We have RO water (reverse osmosis) so it it pure with no minerals. I unscrewed the filter and then it started working again. The dual mist does not produce steam from both ports if flow rate is too slow. The cool steam works well. No residue on furniture. I haven't tried the warm setting. It is easy to refill with water. One tank lasts about one day on moderate rate. Overall, it works okay. Would probably not buy this product again. About ten years ago I had a terrific ultrasonic that lasted and lasted, but I can't remember the brand."
3,"Humidifier works well, but the lid for refilling is VERY hard to open","We purchased this humidifier for our bedroom to use on dry winter nights. It works very well - it is very quiet, it adequately humidifies our room, and it does not leave any moisture or residue on any surfaces. I wish it turned itself off when it runs out of water (it only displays a red light), but that's not a big deal because it easily lasts thru the night with plenty to spare. My one big complaint is that it is *very* hard to remove the lid to refill the tank. I would not recommend this to anyone with arthritis or with weak hands - I have a large grip, and it still takes me several seconds to pry it open."
5,Best Ultrasonic For The Money,"After shopping around, this product seemed to fit my budget and needs. I have it being used on the first floor of a Cape Cod in a family room/dining room with a total amount of 460 sq. ft. It's keeping this living area at around 40% humidity with an inside temperature of 68 degrees while the outside temprature is around 30 degrees. The unit runs very quietly and I am very satisfied after one month of operation."
4,"Overall Great, But Small Leak","This humidifier works extremely well. On the downside, we've only owned it for a few months, and the poor design of the unit caused a small crack where the handle meets the water container. It doesn't leak when its on the base, just from the sink to the bedroom. Overall, works very well!"
2,Disapointed,"The Spt SU-4010 humidifier was a big let down after what I read about it. It used up a lot of water and it was only at 1/2 setting cool mist. The humidity in the room did not increase at all. I returned it and am wating for the refund, hope it comes before christmas."
4,Quiet and effective one-room solution,"Its quietness makes this a good bedroom humidifier. It can be a bit tricky to open the bottom for filling, especially if wet, but wrapping a towel around it helps. The filter doesn't have to be replaced so terribly often, but I do wish it was a standard filter instead of a custom design. Otherwise, no complaints."
1,Totally Disappointed,"Would not produce a mist unless it was on heated mist. I really like the cool mist humidifiers, but, purchased this one because it had both options. I have an old cool mist with the ultrasonic generator and it puts out a lot of cool mist. Really disappointed in this product. Gonna send it back for a refund."
2,Great when it works... then it doesn't.,"Unit works very well when it's functioning. The dial allows excellent control over the mist produced, which can be set very high for a visible steam trail that empties the unit quickly. Unfortunately, it only worked for about a month. It turns on now, but doesn't actually do anything.I'll update with details depending on what happens."
1,DO NOT BUY IT,"This is a very poor product. It broke after 30 minutes. Just stopped working. The power light went dark. Moreover, the design is also not good. The cap is big, difficult and leaky. No idea how people have given this high rating. Do yourself a favor and not waste your time and money."
1,Resin in filter leaked into unit on first use,"Plugged in humidifier, filled with filtered water, fired it up.Producing a nice quality vapor in no time (manual says 10 minutes I think). Went to check on it half an hour later and found no steam, and resin beads from the manufacture supplied, built in filter in the cap.I put in for a return and replacement. I'll update review after I get some experience with the replacement."
5,"Great Humidifier, Very quiet.","Just received item earlier today and set it up in about 10 minutes. Ran it for about 7 hours on medium setting and it made a noticeable difference in the the humidity level. My living room was very dry prior to placing this in there, and now i feel like i'm in a cool sauna. Amazon should do a better job of packaging the item, rather than sending it in it's own box....."
3,warm/cool mists are one and the same,"super super quiet and efficient. the only thing that's disappointing is the ""warm"" mist. there is no warm mist. it's the same temperature no matter what setting you have it on."
4,Much Better Sleeping with this Humidifier!,"This new Humidifier really helps my Wife and I both sleep better than without it. It makes a few gurgling sounds every 10-15 minutes but that's ok, we got used to it. The weekly cleaning with the brush and q-tips or a Waterpik-jet really are a must. No regrets. This really helps for living in Arizona! Very well made and easy to operated. The filters are a bit pricey but good for 6 months."
4,Great Product!,"We own two of these humidifiers. One we've used for two winters and the other was recently purchased for our daughter's room. Both are working great.Our home has steam radiators and in the winter the house is incredibly dry. This device does a great job providing humidity to dry spaces. We have used the cool and warm mist features and have no complaints with either. It is easy to fill and as long as you make sure not to tighten the cap too tightly, there are no problems with leakage.My only complaints are regarding the filters and ease of cleaning. I wish that there were either a cleanable filter or a more affordable replacement filter available. It is also a little awkward to clean, particularly if you're interested in trying to scrub the water reservoir. Otherwise, I have no negatives to report. We have experienced no issues with white dust reported by other reviewers. We use non-filtered tap water for both of our humidifiers."
5,Excellent room humidifier,"This is the second winter I have used this humidifier. I use distilled water and the ""cool"" setting. We also have a central humidifier installed with our forced air heating system. This system does not require water refills and has a humidistat to control the relative humidity. Nevertheless, I prefer the Ultrasonic room humidifier even though I have to buy distilled water and fill it every day. This room humidifier raises the humidity in the room I use most and also helps raise the humidity in other parts of the house. I seem to get sufficient humidity and do not have condensation on the windows on those extra cold winter day like I had with the central humidifier."
4,Good product,"This is a good product. Second one we have purchased. Don't know what went wrong with the last one, it just did not work when we pulled it out this winter. But we were happy enough to repurchase the same kind."
4,SPT SU-4010 Ultrasonic Dual-Mist Warm/Cool Humidifier,"We use this humidifier in our bedroom. My husband and I tried all the feaures, adjusting the humidity to find just the right settings for us. Some people seem to think the unit is defective after using it for a week, but you do have to clean it on a regular basis. READ THE DIRECTIONS! It's nice that you have a choice of warm or cool mist humidity. My housekeeper noticed it and asked about the reliability. I gave it high marks. I believe she also purchased one for her nursery."
3,it is fine but a little bit noisy,"I bought Crane Drop Shape Cool Mist Humidifier one year ago but it failed this winter. So I decided to try this one. Compared to the Crane, this product is noisy (I use it in my bedroom). I like that it provides both warm and cool mist."
4,"works well, recommended","Unit works well and is virtually silent, a definite plus. Filling the unit requires removal of the clear top by lifting the handle but one must turn it over, and unscrew the bottom cover to fill. The bottom of the container does have water residue so I carry it with a towel so I do not drip water on the rugs. Unscrewing a top cover to refill would make more sense but for some reason, this wasn't the design used. Other than the less than idea refilling procedure, it works very well, is extremely quiet, and easy to use."
1,LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE --,"The unit is noisy and since i ""missed"" the opportunity to exchange...i'm stuck $86! Seller does not stand behind products. If you are to purchase, purchase from reputable company with better customer service"
4,does the job,"I've had for about two months. i bought for my condo. looks good, easy to use, and most important it work!"
4,Quiet and efficient,"Good output, quiet, and has option for cool or warm mist. So far has ample water reservoir for several nights before needs refill. Would've been 5 stars if a better way to fill the reservoir. Have to remove and invert to fill, which can drip water and be a little messy. Not sure how long the ion filter will actually last (using distilled water) and how much it costs to replace. Bottom line, it does what it is designed to do and that is improve the humidity in the room and counteract the effects of that dry heated air.Update 1-23-13: Still using the humidifier a year later and couldn't be happier with it's performance. Just follow the directions to keep it clean and it should last a long time."
5,Great Product,This humidifier is easy to use and puts out a lot of humidity. It has taken care of the sore throats in the morning.
1,Worked right for 6 weeks... but no more.,"Item worked just fine for the first 6 weeks I used it. But now, its impossible to control the mist -- the control knob does nothing. Manufacturer says to return it at my expense, cross-country, right smack in the middle of the winter when I need it most. They also told me how to open the unit to make sure all the wires were right ... of the 4 screws that should have been there, there was only 1! And that one was installed in a way that I can't even get it out."
3,Don't believe you can use tap water,"The main reason I bought the humidifier was because of the ion filter that was supposed to allow for the use of tap water. Do not believe this claim. After five days of use, my bedroom was covered with white powder. The humidifier works great, but it looks like I am going to have to go back to using distilled water."
2,Poor Design,The unit leaks bad....poor design as the rubber gasket was too big and would not seat correctly. I tried a couple of different times and could never get a good seal to prevent leaking.
3,Lasted 2 months,"Unit worked fine for 2 months then quit completely. I called the manufacturer and they had me troubleshoot over the phone, which did not work. They then arranged to have a new base unit shipped to me and a return tag to send the defective unit back. The only part of the process I did not like was having to supply a credit card number to SPT so I could be charged if i didn't return the defective unit. New unit came and works fine."
4,"So far, so good.","After approximately one month of use, the product performs as specified. Subsequent investigation into replacement filters for the unit revealed the observation, by some, that use of a cleaning cartridge (not included with the unit) improves filter life -- and I have since purchased that, separately.Living in a high desert area, I run the humidifier 24 hours/day -- and find that the water reservoir is smaller, and requires more frequent re-fillings, than I would prefer, hence the penalty of one star."
1,Decent humidifier until it stopped working,"This humidifier worked pretty well for the first 11 months of its life. It has its drawbacks; it is kind of noisy, the white dust can be an issue, and the plastic tank smells like rubber cement for the first month or two of use. In my case, the humidifier stopped working right before the 1 year period for the warranty expired, which to me is unacceptable. I will try to contact the company about this but from other reviewers experience I hardly holding my breath. If I had to do it again I would buy another Air-O-Swiss instead of this cheap and longevity-challenged item."
1,broken right out of the box,"warm mist is not working, after 3 weeks of using the cold mist, there is a mold like smell coming out of the unit."
3,"Quiet, but needs improvement","I've had this for a week now and can confirm this is pretty quiet (but not silent, especially with the warm mist setting on). I wish it had a digital humidistat. Also, it's somewhat cumbersome to refill the tank. Water will definitely spill out when you remove the tank, so be sure to do so in the sink or bathtub. Also, if you have the setting on medium or higher, a full tank will only last 1 night (8-12 hours), so you'll have to refill the tank every night. I bought this model because it had better reviews than other humidifiers that had humidistats and were easier to refill."
1,worked great for 4 days then broke,"I purchased this item because it received a high ranking from consumer reports. It worked great for exactly four days, then it broke. I cleaned the unit and it starting working again but then died in a few hours. I bought this unit to replace my Vick's unit. The vick's unit isn't as powerful but its a lot cheaper and its dependable. I think I am going to buy another Vicks unit and use two of them to get the job done. This was a huge disappointment!"
1,Stinks of plastic,For an expensive humidifier one would expect it not to stink to high heaven of plastic.
4,dual mist,The unit does it's job but is a little clumsy to refill. Be careful not to drip when removing or inserting the tank in the unit.
1,Sunpen Spt SU-4010,"This humidifier worked fine for five days, then stopped putting out mist. It also completely covered the TV with a white coating. I would wipe the white coating off and it would be back within 24 hrs. The TV was ,located about 10 ft. From the humidifier. I returned the humidifier to amazon and got a full refund. It also is very drippy and awkward to fill. Huge disappointment."
4,No issues for me...,"I recall many mixed reviews on this item, but I have had this unit for over a year now and have not had any issues. I don't use it all the time, but when I do it works great. I don't use the heat option, just the cool setting. It makes a noticable difference to humidify my main living areas especially during the dry winter months."
2,Did not work when i got it.,"Did not want another I will go to store this is the 2nd time returning items on amazon. Not there fault mine for reading feed back., thought the humideifers I bought would be good for me but one was weak and the other didn;t work. I will keep trying. I do Love spopping on Amazon I must say Most wrok out fine!!!!!!"
1,WARNING- NEAR CORD FIRE,"Bought this unit to replace a Vicks unit. Seemed to work well, definitely raised the humidity in the room from about 16% to about 55% in a few hours (a mid size room). It's quiet, and I have no major issues with the design (the tank does leak if you don't carry it upside down after filling it).***HOWEVER***- we smelled smoke last night, and found that the cord started burning through. Good thing we found it in time. Needless to say, this could have gone VERY badly (thank God it didn't). Unfortunately, I must agree with the others who say that this product is poorly manufactured.We will either return it or will call Sunpentown (we don't really want another one of these in our house). We will also update this review after that. I have posted pics of the damaged cord on the product page above.I would be cautious about using this unit- especially if it's going to be in a kid's room. Buy at your own risk!!!"
2,should have believed the bad reviews,"i read all the reviews and figured i can be careful that the plastic seal is in place. and i was. each night i checked to make sure it wasn't curled up. then i made sure i closed it tightly but not too tightly. worked great for 2 weeks. i loved it. humidified the air silently. easy to clean. then one morning i got up and found it sitting in a puddle of water. ok, i thought, maybe i forgot to check that the ring was in place or didn't close it tightly enough. the next night i set it up a couple of hours before going to bed. i checked the plastic seal. i closed it reasonably tightly, made sure there was no dripping coming out before connecting it to the base. 2 hours late it was sitting on a lake. i'm done. returning it-- it's still within 30 days since i purchased it. so now i'm back on the market for a functional humidifier. it shouldn't be som damn difficult."
5,Well worth the cost.,"This cool mist humidifier is extremely quiet and the construction quality seems very good.Plenty of output for our bedroom, and very adjustable output, without effecting noise levels.Easy to refill and clean, it deserves it's high ranking, especially compared to numerous other brands I've tried over the years."
5,works perfectly,"I love this humidifier. Its really quiet, puts out great humidity, like the features and adjusting nozzle, I like the design as its non bulky, am planning to buy another. No problems at all with this unit. No cons only pros."
5,Quiet and really puts out the mist!,I love this humidifier because:- it very adjustable from light (can't see) to heavy fog blowing in the air- Very quiet. You can hear a small hum if you are stand right next to it- Dual nozzle lets me blow vapor in two opposite directions of the house.- small footprint. I can set it anywhere.- Easy to fill the reservoir that lasts all day at 3/4 dial setting.The only downside with it is you fill the reservoir through a port at the bottom so water usually drips on the floor when you turn it over to set it on the base.
2,disapointed,"We ordered this product because it was suggested by Consumer's Reports. We have been very disappointed. It does not hold very much water so it is always needing to be refilled, and the humidity in our room never seems to go up. A few times the humidifier just randomly starting chugging, and then started spewing water. Sometimes there will ever be puddles around it, so I am afraid to put it on the floor. Not sure if we ae just doing something wrong but it has been more trouble than its worth......"
2,Stopped working after 2 weeks. Tips Easily.,This thing was fantastic for a couple weeks although the warm mist never seemed very warm. Then it stopped working all together. It's also slim and top heavy and would tip over easily.
1,It's going back,"Used this vaporizer for 4 days. This morning (the 5th day) when I took the tank off to re-fill it, the bottom of the vaporizer was completly full of water. So, then I dripped water all over the floor from the bottom of the tank carrying it to the sink.I wanted a bigger sized vaporizer because I have a great room and the smaller vaporizers don't pump out enough steam or mist to moisturize a big room.So, I'll be shopping again for a vaporizer. Guess I'll shop locally - if I have problems it will be easier to take back."
1,It worked for a while...then broke.,"I was so excited and happy with this unit at the beginning. I used it throughout the first winter season, and stored it away in the closet for the next year. The second year was not the same with the first. It started to leak all over the place! Too bad, the 1 year warranty had just expired. I now know why it is only covered for the first year..."
1,Great.....then broke!,I purchased this in May 2012 and got 4 months use out of it. Last night the base cracked and dumped all of the water on nightstand and floor. It worked very well for a while but seems to be cheaply made. Literally the plastic just cracked around the ultrasonic transducer. Apparently the cheap plastic can't handle the stress that the transducer puts on it while in use.Buyer be warned!
2,The manufactory changed the steam to be very weak.,"The old version 8 months before was very good. But now, for this new version, the manufactory changed the steam to be very weak. The new version only has about 1/3 power of the older version."
4,Fulfills the intended purpose,"I bought this humidifier to deal with static being created by the forced air heat in my family room, which is approx 160 sq ft. Since the room is semi open to the kitchen and also has a hallway leading off it, I was concerned that enough humidity would be created to get the job done. I was pleased that it works as I had hoped. I have it sitting on top of a short bookcase and we have no issues with it leaking or getting things wet. I fill it once a day and put it on the medium setting, and I am careful not to overtighten the seal, I get it just barely hand tight. The only con is that the warm air setting is not really what I would call warm. If I put it on the cool setting, I can tell the difference though. I would definitely buy this humidifier again."
5,Operates as advertised.,I have nothing negative to write. The unit operates as advertised since I purchased it in November. The only recommendation I have is to use deionized water if you live in an area that has hard water like I do.
5,Little Work Horse,"Great thinner Humidifier will easily sit on a shelf.I have no complaints on this machine.It sends out 2 powerful streams of steam, which you can adjust the level to be put out.It's easy to lift up the blue section to replace the water. Then the blue section easily just drops back into place.I do have to refill this daily."
3,works ok,"It's quiet enough but two things: 1) I wish I could angle the vents up and down as well as sideways, and 2) It gets the carpet too moist when it's turned up but yet that's when it helps me the most."
5,Excellent Humidifier,"This humidifier works exceptionally well. The mist output is adjustable from ""barely"" to ""extreme"". The rotating dual nozzle can be adjusted to aim in one direction or two, regardless of the placement of the unit. It automatically shuts off when the water runs out. Compared to many products I've used or heard, it's much quieter ... with just a quiet hum and some water dripping noises inside the tank.The water tank is easy to fill compared to most products since you can rest it upside down on a counter or sink while filling it. In addition, the product has a built-in brush for cleaning the base of the unit.Overall, this humidifier is definitely worth a premium price given the outstanding features and operation."
3,"So, so","The product leaks a little bit so you get water all of the place when refilling, but otherwise it is a really good product. If you turn it on high, it will make the floor wet by morning."
5,Best available,"This humidifier is fairly quiet. You can hear the soft whir of the motor. The closer to your bed, the louder it is, but not bad at all. The filter should last 6 months with constant use per directions, with medium setting.So far the water has lasted 10 hours on a setting slightly above medium, closer to maximum range.White dust: I did notice SOME on the glass TV screen. This was after 8 or more hours of constant running. The unit was about 10 feet away and the vapor aimed 90 degrees from the TV. But, the dust was VERY light. I was using tap water. I feel you should not have to use ""special"" water.Overall, this unit is easy to use. Weekly cleaning is required to prevent alga or bacterial growth."
1,It started to sounds like a motorcycle after 3 months of use.,"I've used that in a daily basis for 3 moths and now it is emitting a loud noise which prevents me from using it, since I've bought it to keep in my bedroom. It's impossible to sleep with that sound! I will contact the vendor in order to try to fix that noise or get my money back, but I don't recommend this product at all."
1,"Great, when it works, which it doesn't","After about six weeks the unit just stopped working. We called the manufacturer, who sent us a new unit and requested we return the defective one. Then, after about three more weeks, the new unit stopped working too. It's too late to get a full refund from Amazon, so we may call and try to get another unit, though if it was an option we'd just get our money back and get a different humidifier."
4,Excellent Humidifier,"This is the best room-sized humidifier I've ever owned. It is well-made, very quiet, and easy to maintain/keep clean. The only down-side is the smallish (4 liter) water capacity; set at one-half output, the water tank must be refilled every 12 hours. I'd rate this unit 5 stars if a larger water tank was offered.That said, I like this humidifier so much I purchased a second unit."
2,Did not work,"It stopped working after initial fill up. It was not effective at all. Unfortunately , I had to return it."
5,Humidifier,"This is a geat humidifier. This humidifier put out cool or warm mist. I like the warm mist the best for right now. I have not tried the cool mist yet, but I will."
5,It really works!,"Before we got this humidifier I was suffering from dry eyes and sore throat every morning. I did some research and found out that one of the possible causes for my condition could be dry air and that humidifier could help. I checked out a lot of different humidifiers before I found this one. It had the best reviewes, decent price and dual mist. We've been using it for a couple of weeks now and I can't tell you how pleased we are. You can select either cool mist or warm mist, select the intensity of the flow and the watr in the tank lasts over 24 hours. One time we left for the whole day while leaving the humidifier on and when we came back past midnight there was still plenty of water. I would highly recommend this product. Finally I can breathe in my bedroom and my eyes are not longer dry!"
1,Leaks Terribly,Decided to take a chance on this humidifier dispite some of the reviews and it was definately a mistake. I followed the directions exactly as far as asembly and filling the tank and after about 30 seconds it began to leak from the base of the unit. After trying to find a solution to the problem I decided to just return it for a refund. DO NOT PURCHACE THIS ITEM.
3,"Warm air doesn't work, cool air good","If you want a warm air humidifier, don't get this one. It worked once, then stopped working. The cool air function works fine--is almost entirely noiseless, and I like the bi-directional spout feature. (You have to remember to remove it before you fill the tank or it falls out though.) The tank is pretty small, has to be changed 2x a day when run on a medium setting."
3,Good - could be better for the price,"I bought this to replace a Bionaire Warm Mist humidifier. What I liked about the Bionaire was that it had a heating element to kill any bacteria that was in the water or water reservoir. It didn't throw out a lot of moisture like the ultrasonic's do, but that was OK with me. This SPT unit claims to be a warm mist also, BUT... I do not see any heating element although the mist is kind of lukewarm to the touch after a few hours use, so something down there is heating the water up. That being said, I recommend that weekly cleaning, as mentioned in owners' manual, be performed. Someone else stated using filtered water like Brita. Very good idea - I use the filtered water from my refrigerator. Ion filter is a waste of space and money, and I removed mine to increase water capacity. Bottom line is that this will do for the time being, until I find a good warm mist/ultrasonic combo that Amazon does not seem to be fond of."
5,rkelk,I picked out this item after reviewing the item in Consumer Reports. We were very pleased with it as it performed flawlessly!! We did not see anything negative Per Se.
3,A little cumbersome,"The design could use a little tweaking as adding water is a bit of a challenge but my biggest issue is that the ""warm"" steam still comes out cold. When you turn the pressure down low you can feel a little warmth but it doens't output the level of hot steam that traditional ""old school"" products would."
4,MY FIRST MY BEST,I bought this product as I was well impressed by the other comments.I have no expertise with this type of product as I never needed one until I moved in a cold place.The use of the heater the entire day It dry out the humidity in the air inside the house. I started to suffer of sore throat and dried nose.Since I started to use this product with no noise at all during the night it keeps the right level of humidity in the room with the advantage that you can choose to have a warm mist that will keep the temperature of your room to the selected level.I would suggest to buy this product to all the people that needs noiseless humidifier capable to work across the entire night without problem.
5,very pleased,This was the 3rd humidifier I purchased while attempting to find one that would not disturb my sleep. This was the only model I could sleep with. There is a slight hum noise that is like a white noise and the gurgling of the water from the tank.I read complaints about these leaving white power around the area. I am on city water and I have not had an occurrence of any residue.The only complaint I would have is the tank cap is extremely hard to remove. I would imagine that some elderly folks could have difficulty or result to using a tool.
1,Terrible piece of junk,Accept the reviews. This is a piece of junk. Arrived DOA. Save your time and money and purchase some other humidifier.
1,Don't Buy! It's not a humidifier!,"This product is useless. It doesn't evaporate water into the air to humidify the room. All it does is spit out a mist of water that falls to the ground within 5 feet. It won't humidify the air, it will just make your floor wet."
4,"Expensive, but worth it","We bought this after trying - and not liking - a $30 drugstore-brand humidifier. This thing works great! It's pricey, but it does the job well, and when you have a sick baby who can't take decongestants yet, a really good humidifier is one of the few things you can offer.My one complaint - the reason for the missing star - is that when refilling, it is nearly impossible to remove the ""top"" (which is actually on the bottom of the top part...), no matter now loosely you placed it there before. Something about running the humidifier suctions that thing on, and I've really hurt my hands trying to loosen it. Even my husband, who is really strong, sometimes struggles with it. Perhaps a redesign would help."
5,Quite comfortable,"The bike I have is for daily commuting, and for that purpose this seat is comfortable and useful. I used it to replace a lower line Selle Italia and I don't regret doing it. And it's cheap, but remember this review is relative to the price."
4,Planet Bike ARS Seat,"Pretty comfortable seat, not quite as much cushion as I thought there would be, but it's much better than the seat that came with my bike."
4,Comfortable,This seat is quite comfortable and sturdy. It fit well on my Mongoose bike. I also like the sleek and stylish design.
5,Very Happy with this Saddle,"The A.R.S. Anatomic Relief Bicycle Saddle performs as advertised. My previous saddle (which came with my Trek bike), provided very little relief. Most of my riding is on bumpy rural dirt roads, so I would feel a lot of pressure in the perineum with my previous saddle. The A.R.S. Saddle successfully relieves that pressure. Highly recommended."
5,Best seat I've owned,"Over the years, I've owned everything from Selle San Marco to Specialized Body Geometry, and this seat is seriously the most comfortable seat I've ever owned. If you're looking for the lightest seat around, this isn't it; mine weighs 390 grams. But if you want to be comfortable for hours on end, buy this seat. I can't recommend it enough. I do my best to keep my mountain bike under 20lbs., so I've saved weight elsewhere to make up for the extra grams of this seat and it's totally worth it. I plan on buying the women's version for my wife soon, too."
4,deep channel a plus,"After miles of bike riding, there were no numb spots. The deep channel made huge difference. Seat was slightly wider than I'd like, but the trade off was worth having no numbness."
4,Nice!,"Great quality and very comfortable. I bought this to use in the winter when bike is on a trainer, but I just might use it year round!"
4,Upgrade from stock Trek saddle,"I installed this on my MTB. It is much more comfortable than the stock Trek saddle. For road (longer rides), I use a firmer saddle (Brooks)."
4,Very Comfortable Seat,"This is a very comfortable bike seat, I ride about 15-20 mins each day on it, up and downhill, and it is very comfortable. Some of the roads that I ride on have no been paved for a while, but this saddle is able to absorb quite a bit of shock and helps keep me from being sore."
5,Save your.. you know what,"Bought this and in 2 days I have ridden since, no aches, no pains. Great saddle.This seems firm when you first sit on it, but give it 5 minutes to adjust to your derriere and notice no pain. I usually do intense 1-2 hour bike runs and this saddle is a big relief.I have not tried other more expensive saddles but this is what I found on a lot of cop bikes in the area too. Recommended for the price / comfort. Shipped quickly as well. Just wish this was on Prime :)"
4,Comfortable Seat,I replaced an older Bontranger seat that came on my Trek 6700. My butt would be sore for days after a ride of only a couple of miles. I bought this seat based on reviews and the low price. I could not be happier. It is not quite as comfortable as the seat on my road bike but it cost about $50 less.
4,Good Seat,"Good seat,for the money,but still looking for a better one.It did'nt come silver/black,all black but looks good, less guady."
2,Cheap,"Cheap price? Yep. Comfortable saddle? Nope. This saddle is good for a short ride, a half hour or so. Longer? Forget it. I bought this saddle based on the reviews and sorry I blew $20 on it. I was out for my weekend 50 mile ride and after an hour my backside said no more. I found the nearest bike shop and bought a new saddle and finished the ride in comfort."
1,Bought this after reading positive reviews. Major Let-down.,"My roommate ordered this seat from Amazon on my recommendation, based on the good write-ups it's gotten here.She tried it and didn't care for it, so I offered to swap seats with her and keep it if I like it.Well after a five-hour ride (and I do a LOT of long rides) I have to say, this thing is coming off the bike ASAP. While there was some improvement in chafing when the seat post is set high, sitting on this thing is PAINFUL compared to my trusty Bell memory-foam seat. It made for a truly miserable bike ride.Sure, it may be a SLIGHT improvement over the original equipment seats designed by bike manufacturers that feel like you're sitting on a cement brick, but this IS IN NO WAY one of the more comfortable seats in the market.And if you're as disappointed in it as we were, you should know that should you decide to return the thing, you'll be out not only shipping but also a 20% restocking fee.Save your money and look elsewhere."
4,Confortable seat and good price,"I've had this saddle for over three month and it's very comfortable compared to other aftermarket saddles . When I firs began using this saddle, it was still somewhat painful to ride. However, after a couple of days ridding on it, my body began to adjust to it. I'm now glad that I purchased it. I recommend this saddle because of its comfort, construction, and very reasonable price. Spending money on more expensive saddles wont improve your comfort. I know this from experience."
5,A.R.S as in arse is very funny,"I think that this seat fits a niche of people looking for a comfortable saddle at a non-felonious price. I think it is good for those who usually ride without padded shorts. I finally bought some, but didn't have them for 30 years. I found it to be very comfortable, but it may not fit everyone, as everyone is built differently. I think the A.R.S acronym had to be picked intentionally, as in ""arse"", and I find that to be very funny. One small thing is that after 5 years, the black is coming off onto my shorts. Time for a new one is all. I would pay a little more for one made of all leather or something. Planet Bike seems to be a company that makes quality parts for the masses. Their lights are good too. Thank you."
4,better than the stock seat I replaced,"This seat does what I expected it's more comfortable than the seat that came with my bike.One thing to be aware of is that the amazon description is wrong!It says ""Ultra Suede cover is durable and weatherproof"" But the majority of the seat, the black portions of the black and gray seat, is Lycra. The packaging that comes with the seat, says Lycra, so it's Amazon's mistake and not that of the seat manufacturer.I'm disappointed because I wanted an all leather seat that wouldn't suck up by butt sweat. But for [...] I guess I can't be that upset."
4,Very comfortable,"I've ridden a couple of times on this saddle and I find it to be quite comfortable so far. It looks a little goofy if your used to sleek narrow saddles, but if you've reached that point in your life where comfort trumps style, this is a good option. Also, you can't beat the price! I priced other ""relief"" saddles in the bike shop and I really do wonder where they get off asking over $100."
3,The end of one pain but the start of another,"I have had this bike seat for a little over a month now and it isn't too bad.When I first received the product, I was pleased with the appearance. It was shorter, length wise, than the stock seat for my road bike but did the advertised job. There was no longer any pressure on my perineum. UNFORTUNATELY, like other reviewers have stated, it places a tremendous amount of pressure on your sit bones. This can be easily rectified by pushing your butt back but it does change the way you ride. Anything over 10 miles of riding tends to irritate my bottom a bit. Short distance riding is fine but I would invest in cycling shorts for anything over 15 miles.This seat also puts a bit more pressure on your wrists and hands so beware."
4,Nice seat,"After reading the other reviews, I was expecting a much larger seat....this was just slightly larger than my road bike's orginal seat. I was also not as soft as I expected. It was still softer than the orginal medival torture device that came on the bike. It did still require some butt hardening."
2,"Comfortable, not strong","This saddle has good padding and is comfortable for long rides. However, I can't recommend it for mountain biking as after only a few rides the mount for the seat post began to began to bend, rendering it unusable."
3,No where near as cushy as I had hoped.,"I am not greatly disappointed neither am I impressed in any way with the feel of this seat. The split in the middle makes absolutely no difference. The padding has a gel-rubbery feel to it but stiff for what is supposed to be a soft seat. OK so it has a bit of a squish to it when pressing on the padding but sitting on something is different than poking it with your finger. So I will use it until it rips or something damages it. Then I will gladly move on to something better. I will probably buy from my local bike shops next time. For something like this, comfort is in the use of it not the look or claims about it. My loss is your gain. If you want soft or comfortable look somewhere else."
2,couldn't use it,"If this saddle is comfortable to some people, great, but I found that it was too narrow for my sit bones. I was also surprised how small the seat was when it arrived. I tried adjusting it every which way, but to no avail. This seat was only my third seat that I have tried, so I will continue to look around till I find one that will allow an hour of comfort or a ten mile ride."
4,Good seat,Not sure exactly what the review who goes by Felix Sonderkammer is talking about. I have used this seat for 15 mile rides without any problems and I am over 300lbs. The sticker on the front sides of the seat peeled off after the first ride but I think it looks cleaner without it. I've got about 40 miles on this seat and I am still happy with it.
3,Good enough,"The seat did make a difference. I ride 5 miles one way to work a few times a week and with my old seat, after 2 days in a row I hardly couldnt walk. With this new seat the only thing sore are my legs. Want a miracle by any means but it did do the job."
3,Ball Buster,"I'm sure I haven't installed this seat properly, but I figured centering the seat on the mount (where the two metal bars are level) would be my best bet. But apparently it needs to be moved forward enough to tilt the front of the seat down because this morning's ride was pretty uncomfortable. I hope I can still have kids, that's all I have to say about that.On the flip side, the seat does have nice padding. It's still fairly firm but supports my bum enough to not cause bruises like my other seat. So hopefully I can get this adjusted and all will be well. I've given this three stars only because I think with some adjustments, it'll be a good seat. Minus two stars for possibly affecting my reproduction potential."
3,anatomic relief saddle from planet bike,"saddle is excellent, tough, and gives the bike a futuristic look"
2,Ok not as comfortable as other say,Cheap materials padding a bit stiff not much cushion.Didn't notice any gel padding.Need to shift around numerous timesAverage distance riding 15 miles a dayFeels like a stock seat and not an improved upgradeWould not recommend
5,Great Seat!,"This is a very comfortable seat. I had an older (2006) WTB Speed V saddle and it was awful. The neck was too thick. This neck is slightly thinner and more malleable. Gives your legs enough room/area to pedal fast but gives your sit bones enough cushion and support not to make you sore or numb during the ride. This seat rides very similar to my WTB Pure V, very comfy! (once adjusted correctly)"
5,Impossible to Forget,"Well, prepare for two hours of pure adrenaline, commotion and tears!You're in for a shocking, unforgettable experience, once you fasten your couch seatbelt and press play...there is no turning back on this one!The great thing about it for me, is that once you had seen it, it will be impossible to forget about it, it will touch everyone forever, because it really takes you there, to that day and to that especific flight, and into the lives of every passanger aboard. And that's good, because this ain't hollywood! This was for real!It's so well directed and performed that you don't even realise they are actors,it's amazing! it's one of those few movies that you'll have trouble with getting up from your chair in the minutes after it has finished..."
4,United 93,It is a well-directed movie and it keeps you at the edge of the seat.The events will unfold petty fast and the story is not dragging or lost the stream. It will still hold interest after repeat viewing. This is a must for good-stuff hunters.
5,Wake up America!,The USA and her leaders better wake up to the swaorn enemies of America and the Jewish people. The 12ers are on a mission
4,"United 93, movie and memorial","I 'enjoyed' the movie if that is the correct word. It was harrowing, of course, and sad. I do not agree the movie was made 'too soon' after 9-11. But it also made me angry to realize that because of a handful of right-wing lunatics in THIS country, there is STILL no suitable memorial to the true heroes of United 93. There are plans and construction is starting. But the original memorial design was attacked by fools and phonies who claimed -- beyond all reason -- that because it ""looked like a crescent,"" it was a ""shrine to Islam""! So instead, for nearly ten years, the memorial site is a damned cyclone fence and house trailer. Thanks, conservatives. Your hero Bush not only ignored warnings and then bragged about 'keeping us safe' -- truly amazing -- but you are truly this country's continuing disgrace."
2,AS A MOVIE THIS MISSED THE MARK!,"My rating for this film is as a ""film"". I am in no way trying to disrespect the tragedy or the families of the heroes on this plane. I just didn't think this was a very good movie. It's not well executed and when it was over, I was mad and ready for some revenge! Of course this is the intended response and the manipulation of the audience by the film makers is just plain shameful! This felt like a bad TV movie and the viewers can't help but feel sad and angry while watching this movie. It's the equivalent to making a film about Jonbenet Ramsey back when the crime was fresh and having a graphic murder/sex scene showing the poor child's horrible demise! The DVD transfer looks very good, but I liked World Trade Center much more than this."
2,"mom, this is Mark Bingham, you do believe me don't you?","""Mom, this is Mark Bingham... you do believe me don't you?""When I first heard this I wondered ""What kind of idiot writes this stuff?""Now I know."
1,A Bitter Disappointment,"I lost an old friend in this tragedy. Colleen Fraser was played by an unknown (name forgotten), who like Colleen, was short in height. Unlike Colleen, this woman was practically silent throughout the tragic film. We may never learn the truth about this horror, nor of the WTC/Pentagonlosses in life. I, too, saw the WTC movie, and I liked it far more than this flop. Doesn't matter if ithad big star celebs in the movie, or a bunch of unknowns within if the story was poorly researched and written up just to cash in on a horrible incident. Special effects helped some, but the plane in the film crashed into the ground while evidence discovered afterwards that the plane blew up in midair. I wonder if we'll ever know what REALLY occured on Sept. 11, 2001,"
1,Let These Poor People Rest,"You people should all be ashamed of yourselves lining these scumbag Hollywood producers pockets with your money. This was one of our nations greatest tragedies & of course leave it to Hollywood to try to capitalize on that. ""Oh, some of money will be donated to the families of the victims"", I know, I know, I heard that too, it'd be interesting to see just how much money is in fact given to the families. No matter how much is donated the simple fact is someone, somewhere down the line is profiting off the tragic deaths of these people & that sickens me. This only happened 5 years ago people; do we really need 10 different movies about this god awful event? Let these poor people rest already. As far as anyone having to see this movie, download it illegally, bootleg it, I don't care so long as not one person even down to the smut peddlers renting it makes profit off of these peoples deaths."
5,Very touching movie,"So glad to have this movie. It was well thought outand really brought the true accounts to life. Thepeople who fought back on that plane were so brave,they helped save this nation. They will always beremembered in our hearts and prayers."
2,"This Could Have Been Done Without the ""F"" Bomb!","The movie showed an excellent behind the scenes look at the mounting tension within the governmental agencies and the military on 9/11. Sad to say, I can't share this movie with the kids. They could have made this movie without using the ""F"" Bomb throughout. Take that out and it's suitable for children 10 and up. Just my opinion..."
4,Accurate portrayal?,"My husband and I rented and watched United 93 last night.Since when do Muslims say God? They always say Allah. They also portrayed one of the terrorists as unsure of doing whatever.Totally confused.However, the bonus features show some touching moments with the actors and the families which they were playing the son, wife, daughter."
1,SHOCKING MARKETING!,"Universal Studios clearly has no shame OR executives with common sense and decency.The release of this movie on Blu-ray on September 6, 2011 - to coincide with the 10th anniversary of 9/11 - is such an incredible insult and offense it truly leaves me at a loss for words.This vulgar profiteering is even more offensive since the movie - which is excellent - was deftly able to avoid causing offense when it was made and released.Corporate America truly is bereft of any soul.UPDATE - 3.6.12.I find it interesting to see that so many people have so little sensitivity. No wonder we live in a country where a corporation now is considered a ""person"". Well, not in my world.There are so many other days of the year this movie could have been released, so clearly this was a well-thought out marketing decision.To the person who called me ""ignorant"" for my opinion - I'm neither ignorant in general nor ignorant about the topic of 9/11 having lost a son in the second tower to collapse."
4,Great movie,Great movie about a very sad day. The only thing that I wish is that some of conversations on the plane were a let clear to let wacher in more on the action
5,SAD,"United 93 recreates the tragic story of the flight that fought back against terrorist hijackers on 9/11. It goes deep into the story of the people on board and the people on the ground trying to figure out what is going on. The movie is about 2 hours long and starts from the first hijacking to the hijacking of 93 to the brave midair battle of passangers and hijackers to take control of the plane. Although no one knows what really happened, United 93 does its best to re create it. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen."
3,so so,"T he movie was very interesting to see, obviously because of the devastating tragity of sept 11/01. The acting of the ground crew I thought was terribly bad, you think they were reading cue cards on the set. I mean where did these actors come from? The actors on the plane were't so bad. I'd advise you to rent this movie to give you some intake to this terrible tragedy that occured, but it's not a movie I would purchase before seeing it."
5,UNITED 93- SURREAL!!!!,"I think it is important that people NEVER FORGET this terrible Tuesday Morning. I hear so many people say...""enough , lets move on"". But we are still at war with these radical fanatics ....like it or not. Aside from viewing a Documentary on 9/11 I can't think of a Movie which better depict the events of 9/11 combining dramatic actors and actual footage so effectively. This is a well orchestrated, superbly directed and fast paced movie providing the viewer with a realistic view and accurate timeline of how the hijackings unfolded through the perspective of Air Traffic Controllers, their Supervisors, Command Centers and the Military Command. Also it addresses the frustration of unintentional misinformation, miscommunication which occurred between all of the agencies as well. All the while keeping what happened on board Flight 93 Central to the Movie and storyline. A SUPERBLY SURREAL MOVIE!!!!"
5,Great movie,"Truly realistic and heartfelt, and will break your heart and bring tears to your eyes. Really reminds you of that horrible, sad day. Yet you'll cheer for the heroic passengers who went on the attack and gave America the best example of how to confront evil: head on, and with everything you've got."
5,Where's the 10 STARS on the pull-down menu??,"JUST A TERRIFIC FILM - Almost a first-hand feel of the horror on that day .. .. About time HOLLYWOOD spends it's resources on a project that will surely be beneficial, rather than detrimental, to our country .. ..Strangely, it was the younger members of my clan (college age) that were most interested in this film and not the parents .. ..It's just hard to comprehend the bravery and clear train of thought by the 'pax' on UA93 to want to take the plane knowing what the consequences will probably be .. ..Even on this Sunday morning - there a lot of tears and sobs during the end credits .. .. as there should be .. ..PLEASE SEE IT & PLEASE TAKE SOMEONE WHO HESITANT ABOUT SEEING IT!!"
4,Terrorists in the Sky,Good flick. What it might have been like during that last hour on the hijacked plane.
4,United 93,"Emotional experience. Close-ups of passengers, terrorists and air traffic controllers put us in the events of 9/11. It comes back, planes flying into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. We recall Todd Beamer and ""Let's roll"" although his call to arms is subdued. This is a sympathetic portrayal. Even the terrorists are human. They are nervous and shown muttering prayers. They believe in their twisted mission. A picture of the U.S. Capitol is posted in the cockpit, so we assume it was the target of the 4th plane."
5,Smooooooooth!,"I bought this blade in order to use in my new table saw, based largely on the reviews here, and Freud's reputation. I was not disappointed. while working on a project, I used it in my miter saw, on oak. the cuts were silky smooth, and required almost no finishing. I was so impressed, I have replaced ALL of my blades with Freud and intend to buy nothing else in the future. Try it, You can't go wrong!"
5,Time Saver with Excellent Results,"Just completed some 30 odd feet of built in bookcases.The cases and removable shelving were 9"" rips of 3/4"" red oak plywood with applied solid edge banding on the shelving stock.I needed to crosscut the plywood to length and tearout was not an option.I found that crosscutting with my Festool T55 was less than efficient so I picked up this blade, put a 1/4"" layer of fresh plywood on the table of my radial arm saw (in effect, a zero clearance kerf on the bottom of the cut)set up my length stops and crosscut 60 shelves, 20 case sides and precut solid stock for field applied face frames.This blade produced cuts on par with my Festool setup, was much faster for this application and the blade performed nearly as well on my slidesaw in the field (there was a little tearout on the bottom of the cut with the slidesaw because I didn't use the zero clearance technique but nothing that a quick swipe with 220 sandpaper couldn't handle.)Very nice blade, excellent value."
5,The best guidebook for rail travel for over 2 decades!!!,"The Europe by Eurail guidebooks have been the essential rail planning and travel companion for the novice through the advanced traveler for over 2 decades. Ferguson takes you step by step from rail station to tourist office to offering wonderful suggested lodgings, sites, restaurants and events in the 17 Eurail countries.Her Base City-Day Excursion (tm) eases travel by getting the maximum benefit of the rail passes by staying in major cities or even smaller villages as a base and utilizing the pass for day excursions out and back. No hassles with heavy luggage! Just pure enjoyment of how Europe is meant to be seen! Europe by Eurail is undoubtedly the BEST guidebook out there for rail travel."
2,A total disappointment.,"This book was a total disappointment for me; there are NO maps (0), no route reviews (just day excursions from a base city), mostly old pictures. If you are looking for a real train guide to Europe (as I was) this is not the one. Try ""On the Rails around Europe"" from Thomas Cook. It hits the spot."
2,Better to spend your money on tour books.,"This book tries to be a tour book and a rail schedule. Buy a good tour book for the countries or regions you want to visit and use the train schedule you get with your Eurail pass to plan your travel itinerary.The book gives tips on how to travel in Europe. It think that the tips are generally not useful.The author's base city philosophy is sound, but in several instances, I would stay in smaller villages outside the large cities. You can easily commute to the center of the large city, but you will have a more ""native"" experience in the smaller towns. Trains run so frequently in Western Europe that you will have no trouble getting around."
1,This is a rip-off.,"I found this book to be just a big ad. forthe Eurail pass. It has hardly any schedules,hardly any maps, and I have just aboutthe same amount of information already. Igot it FREE from Eurail. This book isnot helpful in any way shape or form."
3,May not be what you're looking for,"While there is an impressive array of songs and great pictures in here, it is not really a fake book per se; there is no tablature or instruction for playing these songs, and if that't what you're looking for, this ain't it. Also some of the information in here about composers, performers, etc. is erroneous- if I can catch it, the author should have."
2,Not bad,"pretty good flavor not using it now, just using more natural stuff, but it was good with rice or soymilk and mixed nice and no yucky aftertaste."
4,A fast and easy Euro primer,"I bought this baby as the background for an advanced level international econ paper on the fluctuations of the Euro, and it is wicked good. It hands out the basic knowledge like the Rams hand out touchdown balls, and even though it was written before the Euro's current problems, you can easily piece together the reasons behind the malaise.The only caveat is that if you're really into the mathematical and graphical side of economics -- this puppy ain't for you. If you look at the overload of math that Krugman's International Economics textbook gives you, this pales in comparison. I wish it had more of that, if only so that on those nights I can't sleep, I have one more resource to use. But that's what I have my girlfriend's stories for.Anyway, go buy it. It's good."
2,Over priced,"Cool idea for an item, but much too expensive for the size (2-3""). I expected more for the price that I had to pay."
2,Was cheap,The quality of this product was not even up to McDonalds kids meal toy standards. Was cheaply made and not worth even the shipping costs.
3,Much smaller than expecting,"I still love this anyway, because how can you not love the Black Knight?? But it's smaller than I was expecting, maybe the size of a Barbie doll, which makes reattaching the limbs a little challenging. It's not worth the price due to the size, but it IS the only Black Knight plush I've come across!"
3,Decent Book,This was a decent book. It is especially good for graduate level students. I purchased the book to teach myself perturbation methods for my research project. I used the book in conjunction with Perturbation Methods in Fluid Mechanics. Together I was able to get a complete understanding. Overall this a decent book with a few examples.
2,Is Hed Kandi Over?,If you were waiting for Ministry of Sound to ruin Hed Kandi well then here it is. Thankfully I haven't brought this. After hearing this compilation it is very clear that Hed Kandi is over. The only CD that's any good is the 3rd one and that's cause it's full of Hed Kandi classic's which I've already herd a million times....Don't waste your money. If you've already brought any Ministry of Sound CD's this year then don't bother cause if you haven't grown sick of hearing the same tracks from the last year on radio then you will be after hearing this. Reserve your listening time for something worth while. Quality isn't a word I'd use to discribe this compilation at all...
3,Get this party started,"This is a really good party cd. Before I go clubbin, I heard these cds, they always get me in the mood. The coolest thing is that all the tracks are mixed out into one, so youll be peaking in the taxi on the way to the party. Great fun, buy this cd if you like party music!"
2,Poor quality,"This book is produced with very low quality materials. Some of the lettering is hard to read due to smudging in the printing process, mixed with the low quality paper and ink used. Some Telugu letters are hard to read since the letter's printing is not full and clear. The style is archaic. For instance, some vowel symbols that touch the main part of the letter are formed on the left side of the letter, instead of the right, indicating that this is a very old style and not reflective of current forming of Telugu letters. It would be recommended to pass on purchasing this. It is an exorbitant price for such a poorly printed and constructed book."
5,Well researched.,"One reviewer accused the the writers of this book as being full of conspiratorial right wing nonsense. This couldn't be farther from the truth. People who have read other books by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince, will know how carefully researched and how thoughtful and logical their conclusions are without any political bias.I highly recommend this book for any history buff who's looking for an alternative view on WWII rather than the mainstream History Channel type of redundancy that offers no real insight of the motives behind historical events of that time. (Yes, I know. Very long run on sentence.)"
1,Nope,"It scratched my belly button up, and it mad my belly button itch really bad. I wouldnt buy this ever"
4,"Cute, but a leaves red marks.","I bought this about a month ago, but only put it in a couple of days ago. Since I've been wearing it, the rose petals on the ring, dig into the lower part of my belly button, leaving red marks. Don't get me wrong, I love the ring, but I have to sit up all the time to avoid the redness. I love this ring."
1,Fell apart,"I loved this belly ring, but there are three things wrong with it.1. It arrived with sharp edges that I had to dremmel off2. The piercing part is very long3. The rose fell off and had to be glued back on.UPDATE: Completely fell apart. I know it was only $5, but splurge on something else."
1,25 Natural Ways to Relieve Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"I would not recommend this book at all. The diet is terrible and if I followed it, it would have caused my husband great pain! James Scala has no idea, as clearly he doesn't suffer from IBS. I would not recommend this at all, it is the worst book I have ever bought! I want my money back and I will be writing to him tell him this aswell."
5,Cute Story!,"What a cute counting story. The illustrations are cheerful and attractive, and the click clack adds sounds effects to the story."
2,Too Dopey to be Fun,"In VOYAGE TO THE PLANET OF PREHISTORIC WOMEN, director Peter Bogdanovich angled his camera to show Mamie Van Doren's buxum best as the leader of a Venusian woman cult of flying reptile worshippers. The plot is nonsense of course. A rocket from Earth arrives on Venus to explore. Many of the shots were stock footage of an earlier Soviet film, but in Bogdanovich's early hands, one does not see an iota of the genius that he would later show. The women are mostly blonde busty beauties who communicate telepathically. When they realize that their pterodactyl god is less powerful than a Robby the Robot type from earth, they gladly switch allegiance. This film takes itself too seriously for viewers to see any traces of camp. The sight of Miss Van Doren in sea shell bras and hip hugging capris palls pretty quickly. Pass on this one."
1,below bbbrrrrrrr.......,"Yes, I spent 10 bucks on this spoof after reading reviews and should say cover art looks good, everything else way below one star. the movie starts from lecture--did i pay money for a lecture or for movie? then, when their fake ship is on unknown location sea waves start rolling for kinda 20 minutes or so, and i have impression big chunks of film are missing. colors are appropriate for 1845 not later and as our cosmonauts struggling with nature some good looking chicks relaxing on friendly beach and once in a while catch fish and eat it raw. Fantastic!"
3,Really Cheesy Old Sci-Fi But Still Good Fun,"This Sci-Fi flick from the 60's is just about as cheesy and low in production as they come. Half the shots were filmed for another movie by Russian filmmaker and the other half (the prehistoric women part) was filmed at a later time in Southern California. I actually know one of the actresses because she was my high school history teacher. That's right, the actress credited as Irene Orton (the one who bites into the fish) is now a history teacher. She was working as a model at the time and got paid like a hundred bucks to act in the film.So anyways, if you like cheesy, low budget Sci-Fi this movie is for you."
2,"Fits a 24"" deep mattress? I don't think so...","I just received my queen size C & W mattress pad that I bought to replace one that would not stay on the bed because it was too small and not deep enough (Target's best). I bought it because the product description claims it will fit up to a 24"" mattress so I thought it would surely fit mine which is much less. While the quality looks OK for the price I do not see how it would fit a 24"" deep mattress, mine is 14"" deep which is not that extreme these days and this pad is barely bigger than the Target model, but we'll give it a try and see if it stays on the bed, if not it will be returned."
1,Belt Leather Belt??? AHHHH UHHHHH,"These have to be the most uncomfertable headphones I have ever worn. They look like they were supposed to be some kind of around ear headphones but the lack of depth for the speakers has them constantly pressing up against the ear. After about 30 minutes they become extremely painful. The sound quality is just mediocre. Turning on the SRS only seams to make it louder but doesnt rally enhanse the sound quality any. The only part that was good about it was the mic, and that quit working. The cords seam to get frayed quite easily and because of that the mic no longer works. These headphones are terrible. Do your self a favor and don't buy them. Infact even if they had phenominal sound quality that was unmatched I would still give it 1 star just for how uncomfertable they are."
2,"Looks good, but far from it.","I tried these headphones, and wow...I am so disappointed in the quality of the headphones. Altec Lansing is known for some good qualiy products, but this isn't one of them. First, the SRS ""boost"" battery clip is heavy and big. Why do I want this clip tugging on my wires while playing? Next, they are very uncomfortable for more than 5 min. Last, the sound quality is mediocre. The SRS isn't really SRS, just makes things louder. I ended up playing with it off. Anyway, I shipped them back this morning, and will stick with my Logitech for a while."
2,Thumbs Down,"First off, this headset is uncomfortable. As far as I know, there is no way to adjust it so it fits one's head better, and after twenty or so minutes, it starts to hurt one's head. I had to move it to different places on my head often so it wouldn't hurt. Plus, the earphones don't wrap around the ears, they just kind of push up against them, which isn't too comfortable.The sound quality is decent. The surround sound one can only hear if the volume is up, which is fine for me...I always turn the volume up loud. But, unless one is like me, don't bother getting these for the surround sound.The worst thing about these, in my opinion, is the remote for the surround/volume. After only a couple weeks, the sound only worked in one ear, and I had to fiddle with where the cords plug into the remote.The microphone, according to people I play with online, is good quality. Everyone could hear me find. It is nice that the mic is also flexible, so one can move it wherever.Don't get this headset."
1,Total junk,"The sound is very dodgy to begin with. The surround sound function seems to come and go. But that's not my real issue with these clunkers, my real issue is that they have to be the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever worn. I can only go about 30 minutes and I have to tear them off, for fear that they will crush my ears into unrecognizable pieces of cabbage. Previous reviews mention this problem, I ignored them, so my bad. But please heed this warning: they will crush you little ears to pulp."
3,not experiencing the surround sound,"so far im not experiencing the surround sound, tested it with 360 and pc. the srs just boost the sound volume and add a little depth but not surround, if you want to hear every sound effect you have to pump up the volume, which will make your ear hurt. so far im not satisfied."
5,Necessary staples for my stapler.,Arrow has been around along time and the quality and durability of their products make them the most suitable to use for whatever project you have in mind. Great for stapling plastic sheeting.
4,LOVED THE REVIEWS,"AN AMATUER AT ALL THINGS CAMERA, I WOULD NOT HAVE MADE IT IF NOT FOR READING ALL THE REVIEWS FOR THIS LENS. IT PREPARED ME FOR WHAT TO EXECPT AND HOW TO USE. IM SURE THERE IS MORE I CAN DO WITH IT BUT FOR NOW I AM VERY HAPPY."
2,Warning! May not be what you expect.,"I just received the Canon TC-DC58B and put it to the test. I took non-digital zoom shots, at full magnification, with and without the converter and was instantly disappointed. What disappointed me was that the extra magnification I got was a lot less than I expected. There was little difference in the two shots. In fact, I could get the same magnification by minimally employing the digital zoom feature. I am going to Alaska for the first time soon and was hoping the lens would help me get up close and personal with nature. I doubt it will get me much closer at all. I've read through the reveiws and would agree with the quality of the lens, etc. I don't see where those who rated this a 4 or 5 even mentioned the fact that you will not get much closer with this lens. I don't like spending over a $100 for something and being left with the feeling that I did not get much bang for my buck. Beware and think twice about buying this. Don't expect a lot."
4,Very nice.....,"Jim K. made a great review.....I just wanted to let you know that I agree. This is great. It is very light weight. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is that you need to zoom a bit or else you get a burnout effect (a circle where the corners are dark because it is getting the inside of the lens). That is annoying, and forces you to remove the extender when you want to take closer photos. At a distance though, it is great. Pictures come out great. I highly recommend this.....I would have given it 4.5 stars if it were an option."
3,"OK, but not around the edges",This extends the zoom lens of the Canon S3IS to about 650mm according to Canon. The image is good in the center but chromatic aberrations are very evident away from the center. I photograph birds in trees or in flight. The effect of the aberrations make the branches or wings have red or blue edges. If I confine my expectations to the center things look good but I have thrown away some otherwise decent photos when the desired image is not well centered. If you're photographing moving objects this is a problem.I will continue to use it to pull in the long range scenes. Overall I rate this a plus.
4,Good addition to my Cannon S2,This is a good Teleconverter that added 1.5x to the camera's native zoom. It adds a great degree of stability to the camera for taking those critical shots. Of course when the digital zoom is used it is very sensitive to shake and movement. Overall a good addition especially for the birds and nature shots.
5,Canon Teleconverter,"This is an awsome product. You feel like you're invading someone's privacy with this. Excellent resolution, great for sporting events, etc. for the long shot."
1,Do not worth the money,"Be careful, the result is not you expect. The sensation is that the magnification NOT increase 50% (1.5x)."
2,Not much bang...,Not much bang for your buck here. You still have to get reasonably close for this little thing to work.
2,not worth it,Does very little to improve objects in the distance. Save your money for another camera would be my suggestion.
3,too expensive,"I actually bought a similiar item online that includes the adapter, the wide angle, a 2x adapter, lens caps and cases. All were silver to match the camera, all works great. the adapter is for the IS2S but had 4 other adpater rings for other cameras. I usually buy the canon brand but for the price diff, it was a no brainer...I paid just under 70.00 for all"
4,Good tele,"It`s a good tele, but i feel a little dissapointed,about the material. it it plastic, so in my adapter made by Lensmate ( made on aluminium ) it`s feels like gonna loose the treads."
4,"so far, so good.","I've owned my Canon Powershot S5 IS since October and just recently purchased the tele converter lens and lens adapter (required). I love this lense so far and have been able to take some great shots that appear to be crisp and without blur. I had read other reviews that said the edges of the pictures were blurry, I have not had this problem. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you have to zoom out a bit in order to get rid of the ""tunnel"" the lens creates when you are taking pics. This is kind of a cool way to frame the picture, but not always ideal for every situation."
3,It is just OK,"This lens did not provide as much enlargement as I was hoping for. For as big as the lens is and the process to change the lens, I was hoping to get more out of it. I still use it, but sometimes it just isn't worth the bother. I think I would have passed on this purchase if I had tested it out before and just saved the money for another camera."
2,No way is this worth $50,"I put this on my son's wishlist for Christmas and was mortified at how flimsy this was. I don't recommend spending $50 for this item, it's just chinsy and seems cheaply made. The concept is great but it's just not what I was expecting."
1,crappey,THIS TOY WAS A WASTE OF MONEY...25.00 DOLLARS FOR A PIECE OF JUNK.IF I DIDN'T GIVE IT TO MY GRANDSON FOR CHRISTMAS I WOULD RETURN IT WITH A BIG BOW ON IT...JUNK.JUNK.JUNK
2,Very small not well made,Small and not well made. For the amount of cars we buy these companies should make some well made toys to go with them already.returning.
4,Fun Toy,"My grandson enjoys playing with this toy, He especially likes using the real water and true-to-life action of the carwash. It is best played with outside since it can create a mess."
5,This is a wonderful toy!,We bought this Car Wash for our little boy to go along with the Matchbox hero city playset. He got it for his 4th birthday and out of all the gifts he got for his birthday- the matchbox hero city car wash and the rest of the set is what he spends most of his time playing with out of everything else. We finally have a use for all the cars he has- he loves taking the cars through the wash and up the elevator to get dried off! I highly recommend the Matchbox hero city playset and the car wash by its self is a great product! I am so happy that Matchbox has came out with the awesome sets that you don't have to put together and they can be moved without pieces falling off of them. Its great to be able to use all those little matchbox and hot wheels cars we had stored in their box. Now they get played with daily and it keeps my little boy occupied on those rainy days!
2,"Not what i was expecting, disappointed but",my son does like it but i was expecting something better. happy i only spent 15 plus ship! any more is kind of a rip off
3,Fits Some Cars; Tough to Use as a Standalone,"Son received this as a Christmas gift.Car wash is designed to be used with other items in a city layout. Ramps are great if you have another piece of the set to which you can extend them; however, they don't reach to the ground/floor if used as a standalone. The car wash platform only fits some size cars. Longer or taller either won't fit or hang up. Although could use water to get full effect, we chose not to. Although it's neat to look at and play with a bit, it failed to become a favorite."
1,VH1 Metal Mania: Stripped Across America Tour Live FALSE ADVERTISING!,"first off....i made this purchase because it looked great...to my suprised...it was sent to me with a totally different cover on it..and in addition, don dokken as advertised. as you can see on the cover, ISNT EVEN ON THIS DVD!..AMAZON...WAKE UP!"
4,Nice Selection,This is a nice set of different size hairsprings for someone who works on clocks. They appear to be of decent quality.
2,A little problem,The instructions for programming don't match my car. I will have to pay to have someone program it for me.
4,Billie Holiday,"To Whom It May Concern:I just received the the Billie Holiday CD ""Greatest Hits."" It is a wonderful CD which included my favorite song of hers ""The Very Thought Of You."" The CD is very enjoyable and the service provided by the vendor excellent. I received the CD quickly and undamaged."
3,"Good sandpaper, but misrepresented","This is good sandpaper for bare wood as the product label says. However, the Amazon description says it's good for many different surfaces: it's not. Get it for bare wood only."
2,Wearing off too quickly,"comparing to other paper such as ""3M 120-Grit 9-in W x 11-in L Sandpaper Item #: 96165 | Model #: 20120CCG-SBP "", which belongs to Sandblaster Pro family, this paper wears off too quickly with a sander. Almost have to change every minute and can't get anything done in time. With the more expensive yet effective one, I can obtain much satisfied result.For 150 or higher grit, wearing off might not be so obvious."
1,"Does not work as advertised, sand comes off easily. DON'T BUY!","This must be for Balsa wood or dry rot. I tried sanding on a simple piece of 2x4 and the sand just came off like nothing.It feels like the glue is old, the product was a production reject or 3M is in the business of ripping off customers, but in either case I feel betrayed. Buying a new batch in a store might give me the answer.Don't buy this!!!"
3,"EROS quality is not good, so get Moserbaer one","There are only 2 manufacturers of this movie. EROS's copy had digital issues and pretty medium quality film itself (subtitles though were good and made sense) - therefore I do not recommend EROS's copy. But the replacement I got is by 2nd manufacturer - Moserbaer. Much better quality and no digital glitches (at times subtitles are a little on a wierd side ..) - I kept that one and love the movie. And for those how would like Indian version of Romeo & Juliet with Aamir Khan doing a great job playing Romeo's role - recommend to get this movie (very sweet, emotional and rememberable, with couple of very catchy songs!)"
4,It's Bear - he's always awesome.,"As usual, Bear and friends are wonderful. My 3 1/2 year old didn't like this one as much because there is less music and more talking. But as she gets older I'll think she'll be able to follow along more. As for me, I reviewed it and thought it was good."
2,We LOVE Bear! But this DVD was a dud.,"My 16 month old son and I love Bear in the Big Blue house. We have many of his shows and love most of them. But, this one was a flop. Not sure if it is the new format and music or the new, more mature themes, but it didn't work. My son pays no attention to this DVD, but loves the others.Opt for ""Dance Party"", ""Bear for all Seasons"", and the nighttime ones and skip this one..."
3,not what I expected,"My experience with Freud blades has always been excellent, however, I'm not impressed with this one. I'm using this with a new Bosch 4212L Miter saw. I'm getting a lot of kick backs with small pieces and the cuts are not any cleaner than I was getting with the 40 tooth Bosch blade that came with the saw. The blade appears well constructed and sharp. I'm not sure what the problem is, maybe it's just me getting used to a new saw... but I'm not getting the performance I anticipated."
5,great blade,Exellent blade. Thin and long lasting. Kind of pricey but WORTH IT!! Avanti is my favorite blade. Have used them for years...
3,Okay Biography,"Unfortunately, this is the only actual ""biography"" of Kim Novak available. Larry Kleno's book ""Kim Novak on Camera"" which is technically a critical filmography, is actually much more enlightening in portraying its subject. Kleno uses multiple sources and first hand accounts to flesh out his story, while Brown's book seems hastily written and researched. It is only saved by Novak's own written statements which appear at the end of chapters and often refute the information previously relayed in the chapter! All in all, it comes across as a rather slick and superficial look at this dignified and gracious woman's life. Likewise, it never really begins to relate the impact that films like ""Vertigo"" have had on the public, and Novak's extraordinary contribution to them. All in all, Novak deserves better, but at least we have a few first hand accounts from her in the book to begin setting the record straight."
3,Cheap!,"I bought this to add another moniter to my old computer. I bought the wrong size, but the item was in good shape."
3,Description is for ZEN NANO PLUS & not for ZEN NANO,"Hi all, as mentioned by other buyers also, description is not correct on this page. Amazon has mistankly printed NANO PLUS's features here & which has fooled me like others.Remedy - either return this product & buy NANO PLUS or ask for a 15% refund (for the people who have already bought it). Amazon does provide a refund.legendryleo.."
4,Incredibly small and light,"The only downside is having to use a USB cord to copy files from my PC. I own a muvo and you can just plug it in direct without a cord. Apart from that minor issue, it's a great little player."
3,Good but...,"The screen is very small. But overall it was good for its price. Although I ordered a Zen Nano Plus, but Amazon sent me a NANO instead!!! which does not have a radio. Today I saw the iriver video player which was cool! it was really small and easy to use. I recommend that one instead."
3,No FM radio,The MP3 player works fine but there is not FM radio in it. Beware of what they sell you. Other wise its ok.
4,Nice but Description Wrong - No FM Tuner,This is everything I expected EXCEPT I wanted an FM Tuner as in the description - which is for a PLUS. Be careful. If I didn't want it for a vacation I'd return it.
4,NO FM TUNER,"Contrary to the amazon.com description, the zen nano DOES NOT HAVE AN FM TUNER! Too bad I had to find out the hard way after receiving the item! Disappointing."
1,Creative Labs has no technical support for problems,"I purchased a 512MB MP3 player from creative labs in April of last year. Initially I loved the product - it stored a lot of songs, the sound was good, and it was light weight. A couple of weeks ago my MP3 player stopped working properly - and I went to the web site to try and get support. I was told via email that THEY WOULD NOT EVEN ADDRESS THE ISSUE because it had been 13 months since my purchase. The email goes on to state that I can PAY THEM FOR ASSISTANCE AT A RATE OF $14.99 for every 30 minutes of ""assistance"" they provide.I would recommend that anyone who values customer service stay away from all Creative Labs products."
1,My Old Dull Blade Was Sharper!,"I thought that this had to be a wonderful blade because of the Freud name. I put it on my trim saw and I thought I put it on backwards it cut so badly. I tried to use it once, then put my old blade back on with the missing teeth; if you're going to cut anything harder that hot butter, don't buy this high-priced coaster!"
4,"Nice blade, wrong arbor size","Unfortunately, this item comes with a 20mm arbor hole instead of the stated 5/8"", so I had to go online once again to buy a 5/8""-20mm adapter bushing. No big deal, just irritating. Otherwise a lovely blade."
5,Great stuff,This stuff is 10x better than any version of KY we've tried. It stays slippery for a long time and it isn't sticky.
