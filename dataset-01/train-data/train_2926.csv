5,Asian Rogers & Hammerstein Swings American,"This movie is somewhat dated now in the sense of San Francisco scenery and the tradition of Asian immigrants venturing into America for arranged marriages. However, it is a fabulous fantasy that works very well on the screen in the tradition of The Sound of Music. Of Miss Kwan, what can I say other than she is a great beauty and ""enjoys being a girl"". The other actors are excellent as the modern ABC (American Born Chinese) Asians clash with the cultural values of the old world.An ""Oceans 11"" attitude and film that at times reminds you of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" in between all of the great musical numbers make for a very entertaining film. Wonderfully acted, colorful and full of old time style make this a must see.Also the extras explain a lot about how the film was put together. Art work, actors, and direction are explained in nice detail. Worth the price!"
4,Great Old Movie,Brings me right back to rainy Sunday afternoon movies. R&H hits the right tone for me.
5,Seven stars,"Thanks, Michele & Bob for all the inspiration contained here. Five stars is barely adequate so I added a few extra. This was only possible because of your message. Only thru the power of positive thinking and music, am I able to enjoy the California sunshine in my life. Otherwise, I might be miserable in Chicago."
5,Be a Magnet to Money,"I have always dreamed of owning a Mercedes, living in a million dollar home, having all the clothes I could think of, and dining in the most expensive restaurants ever since I could remember. I still desire those things and I have wondered why I haven't attained them. After listening to Michele's tapes the answer was very simple. I have been reinforcing a poverty consciousness and overriding my desires of wealth. My poverty consciousness is so powerful that my desires of becoming wealthly were never allowed to manifest. That's what's so great about these tapes is they directly aim at changing the core of my ""poverty consciouness"" into a ""wealth consciousness."" I'm usually a skeptic of anything like this but this is so ingenious, effective, and powerful that I had to write."
1,Sing to get money?,"I'm sorry, I just don't get it. This tape had very little information and the whole idea of singing the song and let the money flow in just doesn't cut it with me. I understand obtaining money isn't all about working for it, this tape hints at how you have to change your internal feelings to allow youself to ""accept money"", but it just doesn't really get into any detail."
2,poor fit,the goggles didnt fit me very well and a lot of wind went around them. I they didnt fit anyone in my family either. I think the material is a bit too stiff to allow it to comform to one's face. Otherwise I would rate the goggles highly.
3,Okay goggles,The padding around the rim is coming undone after a couple of months. You get what you pay for.
4,Jack Benny volume four,"Very funny and like all the digitally restored videos, the quality of the picture and sound is wonderful!"
5,I loved the book.,"I thought Baker's Boy was one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. It ranks up there with Jordan, Goodkind, Anthony, and McCaffrey. It was exciting and interesting."
4,A Spectacular Combination of Romance and Drama,"This book is absoluetly fantastic! J.V. Jones' did a wonderful job of mixing the wonders of magic with the thrill of adventure. The book goes from one life story to the next, and eventually, they seem to collide."
3,"A reasonable book, but...","I found the story quite good, or at least not as bad as some I have had the misfortune to read. The plot was at times difficult to follow as the story jumped between the various sites within chapters: I feel to would have been better if Julie had kept the two main storylines (Jack/Melli and Tawl) in separate chapters. A vague timeline (eg five years later) at the start of a chapter would also have helped: at one point I was two pages into the chapter before I realised the nine-year-old Jack was now nearer 17!. I agree that the ending was a bit loose but it was always stated to be part of a series of books (after having read Piers Anthony and Terry Pratchett, I find a 3-book trilogy unusual). I certainly will want to read the rest of the series."
4,A very good and entertaining book. Worth looking for!,Baker's Boy is a very good book to read but the author's promise of powerful knowledge learned by the baker's boy is unfulfilled. If not for that this would be a 5 star book in my opinion.
2,Being generous,"I had a difficult time getting interested in this book. Many of the characters seemed too one-dimensional. Most notably the (main?) character, Jack.The plot and setting seemed to be 'make up as you go'. The most interesting character was Tawl the knight. His angst kept me interested for 2/3rds of the book.If you're looking for intrigue and depth, I'd recommmend the 'Wheel of Time' books.I'll not buy any other books in this series, because there was nothing in it to hook me."
1,yuck,"I really wanted to like this book. The storyline had promise, but the characters are about 1 inch shallow. Every scene with the archbishop has him indulging in some exotically decadent food. The female character is is moved tiresomely from one predicament to the next and never manages to DO anything. I won't be buying the rest of the books in this series."
1,I think Monty Python made more sense...,"This book is one to avoid...seriously. Keep away from it. Those people that gave it 5 stars DON'T know what they're talking about. If you've seen any of the Monty Python movies, you'll see that they make more sense than this book. And Monty Python isn't supposed to make sense. First of all, the book is endless. I could write a story along those plot lines in, like, four pages. Actually, four words: Rape, Murder, Stupidity, Nonsense. That's all you need to know. Keep away, that's all.The knight, Tawl, was okay...but he could have been better. And we don't need to know what goes on in a bedroom in this book. It's completely irrelevant. This book is probably good for 21 and older who like to read about rape, murder, and sex all in one page. And if you also like very bad grammical writing. IN SHORT: Worst book I've ever read."
1,ABC to Fantasy Writing,"I picked this book up primarily because I wanted to see what the fuss was about and partly becuase I'm a sucker for glossy covers. Drawing on almost every fantasy cliche and with dialogue that a four year old would comprehend this is really fantasy writing at its worst. Since the late eighties we have seen a glut of new writers jumping on the fantasy bandwagon. Few, very few are any good. For a novice to the genre I suppose this would be a good starting point as it is easy reading, but my advice is to stick to Jordan, Goodkind or even better Guy Gavriel Kay. Throw this one in the bin along with Eddings and the rest of the no hopers"
4,good start to a trilogy,"the baker's boy is a riviting and exciting book filled with deception, loyalty and intrigue. This book will leave anyone eagerly awaiting the next in the series."
1,"Insipid, banal, and badly written","This book was so predictable, dull, and uninteresting that I didn't even finish it. Like the juvenile novelization of a B-grade fantasy movie. I just couldn't bring myself to care what silly thing happened to those dull - not dull, downright *stupid* characters. Give me Robin McKinley or Tad Williams any day."
3,A NICE FANTASY BOOK,"I previously though fantasy literature was already dead because of the inexistent quality in most of the books I read. Mrs. Jones (and others -like Tad Williams-) give new life to the gener. They are not Tolkien but I am enjoying reading the entire series of ""The Book of Words"""
4,Funny Novel (Hehe),"Having read the entire series already, the first novel starts off a bit slowly and confusing. However, the series itself is well written out and very humorous. The charachters in the novel are very realistically portrayed as far as fantasy goes, tho the same cannot be said for many other novels in the fantasy genre. Memorable charachters in the series aside from the main charachters include the lil kid thief, the fat priest who constantly eats, and the two castle guards who have very humorous conversations about womanly affairs. Overall a very good series."
4,"Good Book, But have to buy the trilogy","The Book starts out strong.. the first book, the baker's boy is totally cool, it suprizes you,then you have to get the second.. that book is good too, but the third book, makes the series all too predictable."
3,ALMOST A WINNER,"The plot was there, the idea was great...but the execution sadly lacking. Language was sometimes difficult to believe as being in that world (e.g. atrophy a word mostly used in medicine). I thought Jones was a little crude at times and I was extremely annoyed at the ending which is designed to make me buy the sequel but which has put me off Jones for good. Also, her character development of Jack the hero was too shallow...I ended up being more sympathetic with the villain Baralis, whose rich character was skilfully crafted.A great shame. Such potential."
2,Ouch!,"My goodness this is a bad book. Poorly written, incomprehensible scene transitions, characters so similar it is impossible to tell them apart. And the story... the same, old fantasy tale of orphans that find out they have magical powers and the cabal of rich, powerful baddies out to get them. YAWN.Huh? This is a series that people fall in love with? What am I missing?"
2,"Enjoyable, but not great","The book was captivating, plot kept me interested, however the author's style was detrimental to my enjoyment. Jones adopts a very storyteller-esque style. I could imagine the book being narrated, however much of it seemed stylistically to be geared towards children, while the content was definately meant for adults. Also some of the interludes meant to provide humor serve more to further lower the quality of the book from truly impressive high fantasy, to a run of the mill pulp fantasy novel. The Baker's Boy was the most enjoyable of the three books in the Book of Words series for me, but that may be because the style hadn't worn me down yet."
1,A real waste of money and time,"When it started with a rape I thought it would get better. It did....NOT! Rape, rape and rape. That's the basic theme in this book. I skipped most of the book, cause it was dumb and nonsense. This is one of the worst book I ever read. Avoid it!"
1,"YUGH!!! Avoid, avoid, avoid....","I don't even know why I FINISHED this book, such a bore! Filled with gross remarks, boring characters that never really live (exept maybe the old man whose name I don't remember, the one that is killed by that boy who calls himself a knight). Don't bother to waste your time...."
5,It's all in the delivery,"As a long fan of fantasy, I would first have to acknowledge that the overall plot of this story is pretty standard. This, however, was not a deterrent with a cast of personalities that were interesting and (just as importantly) stayed true to form. The guardsmen were lewd, the evildoer was appalling, and the common people were ... common.The faults and simple actions of the lowly are as relevant to the story as those of royalty. The flashy scenes of your typical fantasy novel share center stage with mundane acts, humor and fate - all equally important and compelling.Although this book/trilogy does not break any 'new' ground in the fantasy genre, it is an excellent delivery of a solid fantasy story."
2,Uneven and disappointing,"Very uneven writing--melodramatic and cliched, obviously a first novel. The plot itself is interesting enough but most of the characters are flat renderings/caricatures and it makes it painful to read. Skip this one and try J.V. Jones' later works."
4,Very nice start to a good series,"Baker's Boy is a great first book by J. V. Jones. It is basically an average fantasy book with above average writing and characters.In this first book she concentrates mostly on introducting the reader into the characters and setting up the conflicts for the two books to come. But don't let that description lead you to believe this book has no action, because it has plenty. The book also has a snippet of humour here and there (two hilariously naive gaurds Grift and Bodger, come to mind) and in other parts the book is actually touching. I also liked how even the bad guys in the book had some redeeming qualities (Kylock excluded) and the good guys aren't exactly perfect.This book and it's ensuing series may not be the best fantasy written, nor is it in the top 20, but it is still a great read and I recommend them strongly. Hope you enjoy them like I did."
1,Not worth it,"I remember reading this book when I was younger and enjoying it, so I thought I would pick it up for my kindle. What I'd really like to do is rate the publisher for trying to sell this at such an inflated price, but I guess I'll have to just give the book one-star for allowing itself to be priced so ridiculously high."
1,Buyer beware,"Be aware that this is NOT a package of 20 as the website indicates, but a single lithium battery. It isn't even in formal retail pack, but delivered loose in a ziploc bag! Needless to say I returned it!"
3,Vibe oriented british progressive jazz,"I forgot to mention.... CD is 60 minutes long. There is no hidden track. The first track is a 30 second intro of Pierre talking to the audience. The remaining tracks are the eight tracks listed.This CD starts out pretty good and there are some excellent tracks. However, it slows down near the end. It is really rates three and a half."
5,Hamlet is a delight!,"Hamlet and his worrying friend Quince make a trip to the beach. Hamlet is determined to make the best sandcastle he can. Quince, decides to keep an eye out for trouble, but falls asleep. A storm rolls in and only thru teamwork and fast thinking do the 2 intrepid friends make it ashore.I sell books on Amazon to help w/ my kid's expenses, but this one is definitely a keeper!I was also delighted to see a reviewer mention another title featuring the same two characters. I'll have to check that one out."
2,Is this a game?,"I have not been able to even install this product. Nowhere in the decription does it say that this game will NOT work with any version of windows higher than 98SE. Googling only brought back a million different hoops to jump throough, but none of them for Vista. Even when I did chance it and jump through a hoop or two for XP, no dice, still didn't work. If anyone has advice hit me up at greenapples1@comcast.net. As for the game, I am sure it is really a great game, but it will not install easily unless you are a preofessional IT Personnel or have an ancient machine."
3,royal jelly,"I bought this when I learned about it on TV, but really would like it to be easier to use. More like a lip balm I guess."
3,Potent,Somebody please tell me how to tone this down so it would taste better because I've got a lot of it.
2,Meh,"Rather expensive for the quality of the product. The shafts are lightweight hollow plastic and the spinning flights easily become dislodged. The dart itself is unwieldy and less accurate than the inexpensive set I already owned.To be fair, there was some issue with the delivery, and the supplier was extremely helpful in getting the product to me. It's just that the product itself was disappointing."
3,Sexy male virgin.,"Compromising photographs, partly enhanced, are sent to Rachel Blair and Matthew Riordan for reasons unknown. Rachel has also been the focus of annoying incidents, but can't imagine who is behind them. Matt decides to defuse the scandal potential by announcing his engagement to Rachel.Not up to Napier's usual high standards. The premise has potential, but the application was weak. Usually I am engrossed from the first paragraph, but this time I found my attention wandering. If this is the first time you have read a Susan Napier, don't pick this book."
4,Bondage & Blackmail!,"A great story! Meet Matt - he's successful, intelligent, sexy and as mad as hell with Rachel whom he believes is blackmailing him...only she thinks that he is threatening her! Compromising photos get them both excited and it takes the two of them to solve the mystery! Matt is a complex, loveable character and Rachel is intelligent, independent and savvy. They make a great pair!"
1,Hard to believe.,"I found it hard to believe that this guy was a virgin. Wouldn't the other women that he dated have wondered about that. The whole contrived bondage pics were rather juvenile. Heck he came across as a spoiled, bully. Then the fact that they both just all of a sudden completely trust one another like that. Especially after all the things he spouted off to her at that party. I think he needed to grow up and FAST!!! Didn't really care for either of the characters! No real depth or anthing, couldn't connect."
3,Ms.O's Student Review,"Pigs Might Fly is a insprirational book too people of all ages. It can inspire you to do things that seems impossible. From the old saying,''Pigs might fly'',author Dick King-Smith wrote a tale about a small piglet named Daggie Dogfoot who overheard a convosation about pigs being able to fly ,trained hard to do just that. This book brings every animal of the farm and beyond to come together and help each other out just like we need to do for each other as humans in order to accomplish goals.If you love the story of Charlotte's Web,heres another good book about a young pig. Although im not a big fan of animal tales i do recommend this to people who are fond of these tales. This book has more action and takes you to a view of a animal's prospective than a human. The author shows humor between the farmer and the animal's interaction with each other which will have you laughing throughout the book.Andre"
4,My thoughts,"I just finished a great book called Pigs Might Fly. When I saw that Dick King Smith wrote the book I had no intention on reading this book, but I did.This book was a lot better that I thought. By the look on the cover, it looks like a baby story but once you read it you will relies it is a book for all ages. "" There is nothing worse than being the smallest, the shortest or the last."" It is not fun.I think being who you are is the theme in the story. I think even though it doesn't look good it is a lot better than you think."
4,It was a good story but was a little slow in parts,I enjoyed this book. The most exiting part of this story was when there was flood on the farm where Daggie and his family lived. This story would be good for kids from 4th-5th grade who like animals. I would give it a 4&1/2 if I could.
2,Battery application misleading,Purchased this battery for my daughters Samsung A650 cell phone.Battery arrived promptly. The sticker on the battery states A660. This battery phyisically snaps onto the Samsung A650 cell phone but the electrical contacts on the battery do not match up to the electrical terminals on the cellphone. This problem renders the battery useless.
1,It's broken after barely used for 3 months,"This is my 2nd review. I told amazon that it is decent hair straightener after I used once, however it turned out to be the worse! I bought this on amazon because I thought it will be cheaper and more reliable however not. It forst broke the circuit in my bathroom a few times and then the plug reject it constantly, so I tried it on a different plug that doesn't have a security on it to reject and it explode...I literally saw the flame and the electricity and whole apartments circuit became off! I will go and get a cheaper one from ross, which will satisfy me more probably...I'm considering to send it back to andis if I can! Horrible! It's not reliable plus it doesn't give the perfect shape and leaves marks on your hair..."
5,The best and most complete english grammar ever!,"...it covers almost everything you would ever like to know about English Grammar presented in an scientifical but very understandable language. Regional forms are also dealt with like American, australian or South African English! Clearly the best book in the field!"
3,Microsoft Sam,"I really wish that the voice actors were better! The man that played Yuki literally sounded like Microsoft SAM! If you can get over the awful acting, then this is a really cute yaoi anime!"
4,Be prepared to clean frequently,"These need to be washed out monthly. I recommend buying two, one to use, and one to wash/dry and prep for next month. Personally it seems like our furnace is working harder to get air to flow through this style filter rather than the paper/fiber traditional filters... no proof to it, just seems like it. We've been using them for about 6 months... and I think I estimated I'll have to use them for about 24 months to have 'saved money' comparing to the traditional filter. On another note - I usually take one filter in the shower and wash it out and let it set to dry in the tub/shower overnight --- but be careful if you have children because the filter is metal, can be bent if stepped on, (or in our case, my two year old fell down on it) There are some sharp edges inside the frame and the metal mesh covering the filter has sharp edges (inside the frame) that can 'pop out' of place if the frame gets damaged."
1,Bad Deal for a SGH A 707,Purchased this product and was very disappointed as it would NOT CONNECT with my phone as it said it would. I did purchase this item through AMAZON.
2,Does not work for all phones listed!,"I bought this to use with my A-707 and it didn't work. The cable was fine, the CD driver didn't work."
1,Broken CD/Poor Packaging,CD and cable arrived in a poorly designed package and the CD was broke in half.
1,"A piece of trash, and not in a good way","Right out of the self-loathing gay films of long ago, this piece of trash serves up a mixture of bad sex, bad dialogue, bad direction, queer stereotypes, and negativity. There were times I thought I was watching a Blaxploitation grinder flick from the 70s or a film by John Waters -- without the self empowerment, confidence, or humor. Those flicks at least were fun. This was just trite, boring, and absurd -- and an insult to self respecting LGBT viewers so beware. In the end i turned it off before it was finished. Big thumbs down."
2,Weak,"Kudos to the filmmakers for tackling the theme and getting this done and released. Yet, the end result is unconvincing and the film a unbelievable mess by the end. The movie starts well enough once accustomed to the production values, but beyond the first 1/3 it just falls apart. There is little that is compelling here, neither the out of nowhere love interest, the twists, or the violence which in a couple of scenes is choreographed in a way to make it look silly. Plot points happen without feeling genuine. Characterizations, dialogue and violence are amateurish.Not horrible acting, a compelling premise, and the effort raise this to two stars for an interesting take on the coming out story; and while disingenuous and a little silly, it is surprising. The film shows promise from the filmmakers, who I hope are very very young. Due the genre in need of all the content it can get, this film is getting a bit of a pass from me."
4,Hot xxx action for sure in Shank!,"Hot scenes for sure in this prison flick. Is in German with English subtitles, but the script barely matters. What does matter is the lead has an awesome body, and from scene 1 you get to see ALL OF IT !! Some serious wanking with full unobstructed view of his equipment."
1,Not What I Expected,"I thought that this film was going to be wild and meaningful, but instead, it went off its rails too much to make any sense of all of the over-dramatized acting and the awful plot. The gang fights were stupid and nonsensical, the main character had no chemistry with his boyfriend, the violence was gratuitous and unnecessary, and that rape scene was absolutely despicable. Overall, it's a terrible film. If you want to watch something particularly interesting, you should pick up Shelter or Brokeback Mountain. They're all around better films. Don't waste your time with this garbage, even if it is British. (British stuff can still be bad, people~)"
5,Great movie!,"This movie is in English, not German. It is also not a prison movie. It revolves around a gang in London and one of the members trying to break away to find himself."
3,Review,"On this movie it was just a little graphic on the gay bashing. However I would say it was as good as to be expected from this movie. The last bashing and rape sceen was a little much, but very true I guess in telling the story. Over all i would say it was okay. Worth the 15 dollars I paid."
5,Brilliant Look at a Brilliant Show,"If you think HAIR is a cute, silly, hippie musical, this documentary will cure you of that. This is a penetrating, intelligent look at the brilliant, ground-breaking, still profoundly relevent 60s musical about war, politics, love, drugs, sex, and our place in the world. The film includes interviews with the show's creators, producers, original cast members, and much more. When it's done the way it's meant to be, HAIR is a serious, important, shattering piece of theatre and this documentary explains why it still works. (Maybe it will help rid of us of all those productions of HAIR that try to make it into Godspell.) Having directed the show three times and written a book about it (""Let the Sun Shine In: The Genius of HAIR""), I can say that this is the best documentary about a piece of theatre I've ever seen."
2,Not the one,"I was totally disappointed. This is mostly photage from rehearsals of a new 2007 staging of Hair. Endless casting and rehearsals that are completely unengaging.I was hoping that I had found a documentary of the making of Milos Forman's film, but if this documentary had been done more skilfully it could have been interesting by itself. But the continuity is terrible, and it's just plain sloppy. Perhaps there is material for a 25 minute show in this, but then it is bloated up by nonsense to force it up to a length that can be sold on DVD.If anybody wants to help me: Where can I find the fantastic documentary about the making of Forman's film? It's mindblowingly good, and goes through all the casting of the film and the magic that made it possible to do the film on relatively low budget at just that moment in time. How the right people just seemed to pop out of nowhere, just when they were needed."
4,Let the Sunshine In,"Great documentary exploring the history of the musical, the creators and the life and times of the 60's."
2,It's not what I expected,I don't really like the smell..It reminds me a very strong smell of soap..nothing like flowers or roses.. I would not buy a full size of this parfume.
2,Don't believe the easy setup instructions,"The instructions and information on-line lead you to believe this is an easy setup and the unit just ""springs"" open -- NOT! It requires 7 interior rods inserted (supplied)into pockets built-in the unit and it is helpful to have 2 people. Once assembled, it will be ok as long as not subject to much wind. My intent is to use it occasionally for freezing temps overnight (with a heater) and it is probably sufficient for that purpose."
5,Five stars,"Awesome, roomy greenhouse - they really thought of everything. Two door with screens and super secure, heavy duty zippers. Velcro to roll and hold door and screen back while working. Small hose hole. Very roomy. Begin planting in So Cal in late November and all veggies are growing healthy! This is literally a snap to assemble! They provide you with stakes and rope and grommets on the outside for stabilizing. Again, I am very impressed as they seem to have thought of everything."
1,Low quality product.,"I live is Houston ,Texas. I have bought this one several years ago and used only one season (2 months). I have not used it again because I couldn't put it back together the following season. The frame somehow didn't fit very well together after just one season; so I gave up and purchase other greenhouse which I has been using for at least 4 years now."
3,not bad,"Not bad overall. Screen had a hole on arrival, difficult to set up, and zipper keeps getting stuck. But still not a bad item overall."
2,Seriously shocking video quality,"This looks like a poor copy from VHS. Brightness and contrast vary greatly. Subtitles are often white on white, making the plot hard to follow for a non-Chinese speaker - most irritating. There are no set-up options."
5,The importance of a this mathematical book,This book is very useful to those are interested in studying logic and geometry because it is very well written and easy to understand. I found this book to be incredibly helpful for beginners and also grateful for the knowledge that I have obtained throughout this book.
2,"A parent says ""Yuck""","My son used this series through junior high. I'm comfortable with math but I hated the way this series wandered from topic to topic in the name of ""integration."" It's a sort of like ""seeing all the capitals of Europe in seven days"" approach.A student could never learn to ""speak"" math with this book. The formulas and principles are barely explained.It's a confusing and shallow book with tedious problems that don't demonstrate the common mistakes or misconceptions.Yuck."
3,Integral Mathematics Course II,"I am using this book in my math class, and i have to do homework in it. It is not a very well made book because it does not explain answers in the back like other books and it does not explain how to do the complicated problems that they offer, they just give brief explanations and give complicated problems afterwards. If you do not understand topics in class this is not the book to buy, you should only buy it as a review, not as a learning experience."
3,Works but not well,"As a fire starter it is too runny,drips through grate to ash pan, and it does not start denser hardwood pellets without adding more gel which is a no-no. I have been using a cheaper (more soft wood) pellet to start the fire."
5,Great product! Great Quality!,Great product! Great Quality! I installed this on my 2002 Tahoe. Perfect fit and easy install. I also bought a airgun which made the install really easy. One thing. I was using a pickle fork to remove the old idler arm. What a workout. I would recommend an air hammer.
4,A must see for disco fans out there!,This movie was hilarious! Great music (though not original artists)! Filmed in Singapore. Well acted. A must see for disco fans! Relive Saturday Night Fever!
5,forget travolta,You will love this disco singapore version of Saturday Night fever. There is no bad language nor open sexual graphics.
4,Interesting,"If you grew up in the 1950's-1960's you probably saw Bill Gallo's work! This book brings back lots of memories of a simpler, better time."
1,bill gallo is not cool,bill gallo's cartoons are not funny. I buy the daily news everyday just to not laugh and be shock and awed by the utter stupidity and hideous animation. Hey bill................. arrows suck <---------- (bad review)
2,Too dull...,"This is really boring. The topics are presented in a really messy way, with way too many diagrams. Stick with the Barrons book. That one made me want to study."
1,A disgrace...,"I had purchased this book three months prior to the Biology SAT II examination; it offered a concise review of my 9th grade biology curriculum, perhaps too concise. Those who repeat my blunder of studying from this guild will, as I did, find themselves in an inept state as they ponder for several minutes on question ""X"", in a futile attempt to recall fact ""Y"".Too generalized!Ambiguous!Repository of useless facts!Harbinger of a poor grade!"
5,Great Book Overall,"This is a great book even for those taking the Advance Placement Course. I myself am taking AP Biology and this is a great, consise review book. Although it does not go into great detail, which these books are not able to anyway, it has a good source of review questions for both the SAT II and AP."
2,Came with water damage,"In the product description, it said 'new'. Ahhh....Not so much. :PA large watermark starts on the first few pages and had spread to the back cover, apparently; I know it's not the fault of the post office because the box it arrived in was perfectly dry, though obviously aged.Not sure what happened, but it obviously never dried completely out and is a little gross. I might end up asking for a return on this product.Not satisfied..."
4,sentimental six string favorites,Beautiful instrumental versions of favorite Christmas songs on Accoustic Guitar with symphonic accompaniment.Perfectly captures the spirit of the season in an intimate audio environment. Ideal as background music for gatherings of family and friends. Or listen to the CD in solitude as a refreshing meditative serenade. It will become a favorite part of your Christmas CD collection.I wish I could listen to the CD all year around...
5,I Got Shot By His Love!,"D:Ream is sooo D:Reamy!! He's holding a radar detector and singing lyrics like ""Shoot Me!!!"" In one picture he looks like Spiderman, just because he's THAT cool. And in this other picture, he's on the moon with a dog! A DOG!!! I used to have his picture taped to my friend's dashboard, but it fell off! I am D:Ream's biggest fan! And this one time, I got eggsummuhh!! Chi-Chi's had to shut down because I stole all their knives and forks! Pantaloons!!"
4,Makes travel easier for a handicaped person,This is an inexpensive but very useful product. My wife had a stroke and cannot use her left arm or hand. One of the problems she has when she travels is half the hotel bathrooms have the toilet paper and handicap rail on hte wrong side. Now we use a folding commode which can sit over any standard toilet and this toilet paper holder. The protable commode frame provides the raisl and the toilet paper holder attaches to the frame.
3,works ok,Ive found that i have to take the bottle off and shake it lightly to move the ball around inside because itll stop working. I havent had any problem with it leaking but at the same time when my sugar gliders goes to drink from it they aren't getting anything unless i shake the bottle.
2,cap cracks easily causing leaking,"I bought four of these bottles at the same time. One arrived w/ a cracked cap. I just discovered a second w/ a cracked cap. I either screwed it on too tightly (unlikely) or it hit the bottom of the cage as I moved it (most likely). If it fell, it fell only a few inches. The plastic used in the cap is a hard brittle type and not a more flexible type making it susceptible to cracking. I can't recommend these bottles.I've tried three or four other bottle brands recently and the one I've liked the best is sold under various names. It's an opaque white plastic 8 oz bottle w/ pictures of gerbils around the top in blue print and vertical blue stripes running nearly the length of the bottle. It has a rubber ring around the top of the bottle. I haven't seen this bottle on Amazon but bought them at my local pet store. The Super Pet flat bacs have been pretty good so far too."
5,David Fitzgerald's Oklahoma II & More,"Oklahoma II contains technically perfect and infintely rich visuals by Oklahoma's premier photographer. Oklahoma II is penultimate in Oklahoma travel genre. At the Smithsonian, David Fitzgerald's Cherokee work recently appeared, but the Smithsonian show will have been just a preview to the new book, which I can't wait to see. Fitzgerald's work is awesomely deep and intricate. A visual intellectual, with heart. The kind of photographs you want to absorb, every time you see one-- distinctive."
2,Bored and slightly Overdrawn,"I am currently a history major and took an Argentina class because I thought it would be interesting, this book was not interesting in the least. Sarmiento's book, Facundo, is during the revolutionary stage in Argentina. There is to much emphasis placed on trying to describe in great detail mundane things while not getting to the important issues at hand. On the parts that I thought would be of the utmost importance they were explained in very vague terms which half the time I did not know what he was getting at."
5,Crimpshrine - Essence of Punk,"It would be far too easy to say that Crimpshrine has no comparison to any other bands, but seriously, there are few bands that you can really use to draw clear distinct definitions from what is now the ubiquitous 'punk' meaning. Listening to this band without knowing their history or their importance to the entire 80's punk movement is like shooting yourself in the foot. I've been lucky enough to play a large part in the development of the mainland Chinese punk scene, and most of the music we've brought over was largely the punk classics, such as Crimpshrine. Luckily we gradually got people off the kurt kobain addiction onto something with much more substance... no pun intended."
1,Calling yourself Punk isn't an excuse to not be able to play your instruments,"I'm sorry, but this is no classic. It's not even music. Really. I've never received any amount of guitar training, but I do have a guitar I bought for $4.00 at the junk store, and I STILL sound better than these little (...) when I play. It pisses me off that people think being ""Punk"" is an excuse to make sh*t like this that isn't even music. Crimpshrine has no focus and no skill. But worst of all: They have no message (somebody tell me what these guys stand for, because I can't tell from their ""music""). That is unjustifiable, especially in the Punk realm. Want some hardcore or indie Punk from the Cali region? Then get The Offspring's self-titled debut. Yeah, it's raw, but it has amazing musicianship coupled with lyrics that actually fu*cking matter. Bryan & co. ought to kick these boys' asses for besmirching the name of Punk Rock."
3,east bay roots/no talent,"i bought this cd a little over a year ago and really didnt know what to make of it. its some of the first ""new school"" punk that we know today but the group lacks talent especialy the singer. his voice seems to go back and forth from a normal punk voice and a really annoying hoarse voice. the songs have no melody. the only good ones are pretty mess and free will. only get this cd if you want to see the roots of opiv."
5,Great product,"Tonneau fit great, looks great, installation was a breeze, won't own a truck without one ever again, quality and made in usa"
1,This thing is a piece of JUNK,"I have owned this for over 2 years now. It has been sent back to Celestron once ($30 shipping) and just died again. When it is not in use, it sits in the house in a plastic bin - charged every two months. Went to use it 2 weeks ago and it flaked out again. Celestron sent me a new AC adapter but that didn't do the trick. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!"
3,is Ok,"The power supply has many neat features, and it looks nice. It worked well for a while.At one point I tried plugging my scope to one port, and my dew heater into the other port. This blew the circuit breaker, even though the dew heater controller was supposed to prevent that sort of thing.Anyway, not only did it trip the circuit breaker, but it fried a wire inside the box... so the radio, the 2nd cig port and the red light stopped working. I had to take the whole thing apart, which is amazingly difficult! They're not kidding around with all those screws. I can see where a wire shorted, will have to go back in and do some soldering at some point.Anyway, it worked well for a while. It would have been better if the circuit breaker had prevented part of the machine from burning out, but is still usable in one port and may be fixable.I've not had any problems so far with recharging it."
5,HARD TO BEAT,"When someone ask me which first cd of LOUIS they should buy,i always answer buy this one,it's a perfect selection of LOUIS singing.There are other superb collection of his recordings available,but very few offer you 78 minutes of pure SATCHMO magic.There are the signature songs:ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STEET,C'EST SI BON,WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD,HELLO DOLLY;there are the funny ones:GONE FISHIN',MACK THE KNIFE,JEEPERS CREEPERS;The good book:NOBODY KNOWS THE TROUBLE I'VE SEEN,GO DOWN MOSES;The traditional:WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN,SWEET GEORGIA BROWN and finally,there are hits:WHEN YOU'RE SMILING,ONLY YOU,LA VIE EN ROSE,MOONRIVER.What else do you need?About the only complaint i can formulate is that they did not include the best version of BLUEBERRY HILL available.This is still super vintage SATCHMO.Get it you dog;you rascal you."
1,Nothing original,"If you like ""system of a down"" you may like this cd. I don't. The metal rapp thing has already been done."
5,awsome,this is one of the best tools i own it has a nice feel to it. the interchangeable bits is the best thing about the tool. the knife is extremely sharp and everything is placed in a convent area
5,A must for anybody that eats...,"get the straight poop on your poop! A must have for any health conscience person, but I try & get anyone I know to read it. Friends don't let friends have a clogged colon!"
3,12th edition desperately needs one more revision (13th),"This 77pg. booklet has some good info. but you can find similar info. in other quality colon books. I don't understand after all these revisions that there are still some errors. For example, the author explains how to make a rejuvalac with cabbage and then at the end of the explanation it makes reference to wheat berries but no explanation on how to make it with that. The climax of the book and the one that tops it all is the author explains which herbs that will help clean the colon but doesn't say how many milligrams needed per each herb or where you may find the source of this herb combination (if it's out there). Basically the book directs you to a dead end. Buy at your own risk! If the author can make these necessary corrections then I'll give a 5-star ..."
5,The best book on the subject I have ever read!,"Robert Gray talks about subjects such as ""mucoactive herbology"" and ""homeostasis"" that no other authors that I have seen explain."
1,One star as I had no other choices,Cure time was nowhere near what the package stated and nearly cost me a LOT more than the epoxy cost.
3,ripoff,"this is probably a good product, but the photo clearly shows a battery attached. When you get the delivery there is not a battery. Now I see it says ""flashlight FOR BSZ type batteries"" ..watch out or they will get you with this trick. Now I have to find one of these special batteries, which is really nice since I paid rush shipping to get the light. ..not happy."
1,JANET JACKSON 2nd tier,"i respect Jimmy Jam&Terry Lewis alot.and even Morris Day plays drums on this disc.but C'mon this disc is a reject Janet Jackson 2nds.Angel Grant can't sing.she Makes Janet sound like A real singer.the songs,music&vocals aren't even close to the standards once set by JAM&LEWIS."
4,Good first CD,I listen to this CD all the way through. So consequently I enjoy the album and I have kept it on rotation in my CD player for 2 weeks at a time. Her voice is a little bubble gumm-ish here and there but it doesn't take away too much from the music in general. She is the kind of artist who will get better with time.
5,Vows of Deception,"A true story. I personally know the neighbors of this family, and it rocked the community where they live. I believe this evil lady will stay behind bars for the rest of her life."
5,ROBEEZ PLEEZ!!!,"My little boy loves these boots and will have no other shoes on his feet now. They have decent traction and are nice and warm with some wool sox for out in the snow. We need to get another pair soon so we can change them out and dry a pair plus still have a pair to wear, as we have very wet winters here normally. Lars loves jumping in puddles and going out for a short play in the rain as well. From barefoot all summer to his robeez boots in the fall it was a pretty smooth transition because they go on and come off so easily. Now if the rest of his winter outfit could be so easy...."
4,A favourite in this house!,"I purchased these months ago in the size 2-3 for my 2 year old son. They fit great! He loves them an asks to wear his boots all the time. I actually had to put them away during the summer months he wanted to wear them so often. Its now November and he'll be turning 3 shortly. I can feel his toe near the tip of the boot. I went ahead and purchased the 3-4 sized ones, but they're too big! I noticed him tripping a lot wearing the newer ones. The wear on the smaller pair is to be expected. The soles are very dirty and he's got lots of scuffs on the toes and almost a hole in one. But, he loves them. Expensive as far as boots for boys go. Hopefully the 3-4 will start fitting him soon. I don't know what I'll do when he out grows that size!"
5,Great booties!,"Bought these for our little guy when he was an infant and he wore them all winter, from about 5-9 mos. They run big and go on easily, with or without socks, but he never took them off, much to our amazement! We bought navy and they looked adorable with all of his pants, which were either tucked in, worn over or folded up. Perfect to keep your child's feet and ankles warm through the winter months and comfy year-round."
4,Infant boots,"These are the cutest boots! They are super soft and easy to get off/on. Well worth the price for a pair of kids shoes."""
4,Very soft and cute!,"These booties are adorable! They are super soft on the inside and keep my daughters feet warm (when she leaves them on). I love Robeez shoes because they help keep her socks on and stay on her feet. When she has them on I'm never looking for a lost shoe. My daughter could possibly just be figuring out the shoe, but it doesn't seem these booties stay on as well as her shoe Robeez. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a soft boot for their infant."
2,not impressed,"While they are still leather and 'fur' lined, they are not the same as the ones I purchased 7 years ago. I know that is a long time ago, so take it as a grain of salt, but the lining is definitely not as thick or plush as they used to be and they are stiffer than they used to be. I bought these because I loved the pair I had/have but these are not the high quality I expected from Robeez."
4,warm and stylish,"Keeps those little toes nice and toasty. For an ""easy to get"" on those feet, buy one size bigger than current size. Elastic keeps them from falling off."
2,"Cute, prefer UGGs","Boot fits better without socks; however, after I took them off my baby, there was a ring around her leg. So obviosuly they must of been too tight."
2,Ankle elastic is too tight,"While the shoe sizing was as expected (12-18 months), the ankle elastic was so tight that I couldn't even get the bootie on her foot - in fact, I could barely get 2 fingers into the ankle opening. I was also concerned that the circulation to my daughter's foot would be cut off so they were returned. The Robeez Soft Soles Cozy Boot is an alternative bootie that fit as expected with the ankle elastic holding the shoe in place but not causing circulation issues."
4,Good boots for babies/toddlers,"They fit well; the band that fits above the ankle is cozy enough to fit a 9 month old or stretchy enough to fit an 18 month old, so these may be wearable for over half a year! (amazing, considering how fast babies leave clothing behind...) the 'fur' on the inside is thin but cozy enough for its purpose and it covers the inside sole as well. I don't think these would be great if you plan to have your child walking around in snow-they would soak through- but if you have a baby you plan to mostly carry around in wintertime when you briefly pass through cold outside air these are great. I gave them 4 stars and not 5 because i think that for what they are they are definitely expensive. They are definitely not snow-boots; just cozy autumn boots."
5,Perfect booties for boy OR girl!,I bought this in 6-12 mos for my daughter after she outgrew the 0-6 mos and they are exactly what I was looking for. They are a great all purpose winter shoe and very comfortable for her indoors and out.
5,best booties ever!,I looked at other winter booties and ended up with these because they are so soft and they fit my son's feet like a glove. They actually don't come off and he sure pulls at them. warm and adorable
5,"Very nice, soft and warm","These boots are very nice and warm, so good for a baby that is trying to walk, my baby wear them the whole day without marks of the elastic bands, they stay in his feet and look really cool on him - he was 15 months old when I bought them and they still have room for at least 2 more months (he is 5 in shoes for babies right now) - I really recommend them"
5,Great toddler shoe!,Love how easy these are to get on my active toddler! They keep him from taking off his socks and getting cold feet. They also look great with any outfit - we get many compliments on them.
5,Warm Booties,"Robeez doesn't disappoint you in these little booties for winter. Just like their shoes, they are easy to get on and off. The fuzzy lining goes all the way to the toes and fit easily over a pair of socks. I have a pair in blue and brown and find they go with nearly every winter outfit my son owns. Robeez is worth the money, in my humble opinion! :-)"
3,NOT Waterproof!,"I love these for keeping baby's feet warm - but they are not practical for playing in the snow or walking on wet surfaces. The soft soles do not keep feet dry.The main reason I got Robeez shoes was that they were harder for my daughter to kick off. They are great for that purpose, and for those shaky first steps. I'll still buy the shoes, but I probably won't buy the booties again except for non-ambulatory babies in winter."
2,Not great for narrow-heeled babies,"I bought these due to several recommendations received by friends and I was terribly upset with the fit. They seem to be made very well, but the heel was too wide for my daughter. I'm not sure if maybe she has a narrow heel or what, but the fit wasn't great at all. I'm hoping to try them again after her foot grows a bit since so many other mamas recommend them."
2,Great shoes - until you wash them,"We get so many complements on these shoes it is crazy. They go on easily and stay on and they provide enough traction to let our little guy get around on hardwood floors.EDIT - I wrote my review before washing these shoes. After their first time in the wash some of the stitching started coming out of the sole. Not irreparable, but not an easy fix and not something I'd expect or tolerate in a product this expensive."
3,"Very cute, but not watertight","These are nice enough shoes -- they're soft, easy to get on and they stay on. However, they are NOT outdoor winter shoes. They are basically a clamshell design with elastic, so they're open all the way to the sole. I was hoping for something my 13MO daughter could wear outside in the snow/rain and these aren't it. I still haven't found an early walker shoe that's suitable for wet weather."
5,No better Krautrock was ever recorded,"This little-known classic is probably the most playful record ever to come out of Germany during the Glorious '70. W & W manage to sound psychedelic while playing almost only acoustic instruments, charming even while speaking in German (the tale of the little dog Karlchen (""Charlie"") that crosses the sea in a smal boat in the track of the same name), and in general musically superb even while showing no pretentions at all. Not a dull moment in this collection of brilliant, diverse tracks."
3,Krautrock for people who really like German folk music,"Trippy cover, trippy name of album, rave review from Krautrock Sampler: this album seemed to be a no brainer, but I found it to be mildly adventurous acid folk (in 1966) and that's about it. This is one of those overrated much praised obscure records that we've all bought and been disappointed by when we hear finally get to hear it. If you are into zithers played in a conventional manner you might like this. I paid $14 when I bought it and felt mildly burned and I would be annoyed if I paid $28 expecting freaked out acid frenzy. The funny thing is I've seen photos of the band hanging out in their pad with hookas and other hippy paraphernalia looking like full on freaks, but I just don't hear it in the music it sounds like schlagger folk to me. I would try to hear the music prior to buying based on my experience. Amon Duul's Para Deiswarts Duul is a way better acoustic acid folk record."
4,Witthuser & Westrupp - 'Trips Und Traume' (Ohr),"Originally released in 1971 as this was the German cosmic folk band's second out of five lp's. I've heard a single track from this band on various artist discs, but this was the first time I got to hear an entire CD from them. A bit strange perhaps but quite entertaining, I thought. Cuts that truly stand out are the charming ""Last Uns Auf Die Reise Gehn"", the trippy ""Orienta"" (great flute playing) and the nine-minute epic ""Karlchen"". Line-up: Bernd Witthuser-guitar,mandolin&vocals, Walter Westrupp-guitar,zither&flute, Bernd Roland-bass&vocals and Renee Zucker-percussion. Might possibly draw in loyal follows of Wallenstein, Robert Fripp, Walpurgis, Third Ear Band and maybe even Faust. Not a bad pick."
2,Not about teaching,"As a writer tasked with producing content for Web-Based Training, I need a book that would specifically detail how this kind of content differs from other content and training delivery methods. This is not this book. This book is basically a rehash of the author's Web Style Guide. Now the Web Style Guide is probably the best book out there for designing Web sites, but it has nothing to do with teaching. So if you want to know technical details about site organization and technology, this book will help. If you want to know how to develop and tailor your training content specifically for the Web, this isn't it. If somebody finds such a book, please let me know!"
3,Good product but bad smell,"I used the shampoo a week ago. I had no problems with the odor. I used the spray right before we were going to go on a walk. My yorkies are tick magnets. I didn't find one bug on them after coming out of the woods. Maybe it was a lucky day or maybe it was the product, but I find that when I use neem products, they never come back with anything. However, the smell just about killed me. I didn't realize it had citronella in it. I have bad allergies and am sensitive to smells. Certain strong smells give me headaches. My nose is filled up today (a day later) and I have another headache. I'll use it again because I bought it and dont' want to waste it, but I'll wash them right after so that they aren't sleeping with me with the smell on them. This is a good company. I have liked the products I have purchased from them."
2,my dog got bumps and it smells strong,The product seemed to be working great but It gave me a little allergy so I make sure to spray her outside and then take her for a walk untill the scent isnt so strong. The problem I have with the product is that I noticed my dog started getting small bumps all over her like hives. She has never had allergies to anything so I think it could be this product. We are using it in conjunction with the neem shampoo. Also she still gets one or two fleas when using the product but anything is better than using those drugs or pesticides on her! Unfortuanatley I will have to find a different product since my dog and me seem to be allergic to this!I called the ark naturals customer service and they said they have a new prod. called flea flicker tick kicker so I'll try that. They suggested that the neem oil might cause an allergic reaction and the new prod. doesnt have it. very nice customer service.
5,Great product,"I really like the Neem spray, because it's not poisonous, but keeps fleas away. I use it only on the bedding, not directly on my cats. It's also good for people beds and furniture, because it has a very light and pleasant smell.I would recommend this to any per person with flea problems."
2,$37 down the drain,"I bought this film based solely on customer reviews on amazon.com. My expectations were really high after reading the positive reviews. I was left feeling disappointed and conned after watching the film. This movie is certainly not a collector's item or a masterpiece. Can't believe I actually paid $37.8 for it.Good points:1) Convincing performance by main characters2) Good picture and sound quality3) Good flowNegatives1) High cost - with the benefit of hindsight, I won't pay more than $4 for this2) Plot was very shallow3) No `English language' in the audio options - hence I spent more time reading than actually watching the film"
2,don't waste your time...,"i read a few reviews about this movie here on amazon.com, and it sounded like it might be worth my $$... definitely wasn't. i read that it was so graphic and extreme, loaded with gore, but it definitely fell short of my expectations. if there is a guy cutting someone up, i wanna see the body without the limb, not the bloody limb that they bought at spencer's for $10. the ""graphic"" gore scenes were mostly red syrup and you have to use your imagination for the rest. the only reason i give this movie 2 stars is because of the rape scene... although they only show him stabbin at nothing before the blood red squirts, i guess the idea of stabbing an innocent women in the snatch with a fistful of chopsticks is pretty brutal. but don't let that one piece trick you into buying this film, it was terrible."
3,not bad,Beginners will find this book very hard to follow. Mostly basic techniques. Pictures are not the best but experienced people won't have much difficulty in following.
2,Not very complete,"It doesn't tell you what each move is used for. Sometimes the pictures don't correlate, making it hard to follow. I suggest ""The Basic Training Guide""."
3,It's nearly complete but not quite,"There are a great amount of techniques in this book. There are even some rare joint lock techniques I hadn't seen anywhere else; however, they are not well organized. The techniques are scattered all over the place and one must hunt each one down through the pages in order to find them. If the material was separeted into more specific sections, I would have given it five stars. I don't think that the guide is incomplete as far as the techniques it contains but in its organization."
2,"An o.k. book, but somtimes the pics don't correlate.",It would have been better if they showed what each move could be used for. And it wasn't very complete
5,Geat item,By buying chain in bulk it allows me to change the chain on 3 bikes i own for less than buying individual chains. one of my bikes takes a 136 links.
4,I'm not sure which retail stores you're comparing this to...,"...but both lowes and HD have this same stuff INSTOCK for $10 LESS.Im a huge amazon prime user, so Im not trying to rain on the amazon parade here..."
4,good condition,"arrived a tad bit later than i expected it to. amazingly, it literally arrived at my doorstep hours before the class that i needed the book for started."
2,Feedback Sucks,I attempted to use this but there was terrible feedback through the speaker system while using them with additional audio cables plugged in. As soon as I unplugged the other cables - Feedback Free... Kind of defeats the purpose of the product if the sounds is buzzing. I will just use it as a single audio cable.
5,Cheap and Effective,"Does it's job simple and to the point and at a cost effective price.No distortion or looping, i would recommend this to people needing a rc stereo extender."
2,piggyback doesn't work,"I purchased this cable to connect two devices to a receiver/stereo which has only one RCA input pair. If I try to piggyback and have both devices (TV and record player) connected they don't sound good - lower volume and crackle. Disappointed b/c I thought it would work like a ""splitter""."
5,Does what it's supposed to,"I was originally looking to buy a couple audio splitters, but came across these piggyback cables. This cable seems to work just fine, I don't notice any loss of volume or signal. But I'm also not very picky when it comes to audio. I feel like using this cable simplifies the wiring because you can split the signal without an extra cable getting in the way between the device and the splitter(s)."
3,"A tale of adventure, growth and redemption.","This was an entertaining story with a fairly straightforward plot line. Young dwarf yearns for adventure, young dwarf finds adventure, young dwarf learns from adventure. There are a number of other elements, but that's the thousand foot view.The story was, for the most part, well written, although there were some parts that I found annoying. Some of the combat was over the top in terms of believability, but since it's fantasy, I guess you have to be willing to accept some unrealistic elements anyway. It would probably benefit from some realistic downsizing though, since some of the odds get pretty unrealistic and it really wouldn't hurt the tale to scale back some of the overly optimistic amount of bad guys killed by any one good guy.Overall, it was a fun read and I believe it would appeal to just about anyone who enjoys the genre."
4,Great Read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I could really connect with the characters. The details of this world made me feel as if I had been there. As Adams' first book, I felt it was a great start in the series."
4,"A Fun, Easy Read","Brotherhood of Dwarves was an impulse buy. I enjoy Fantasy novels and this did not disappoint. This coming of age story moves quickly and avoids becoming bogged down with too much detail on the mundane. While a plodding thousand page epic has its place so does this shorter adventure. Interesting characters, setting and plot make it all worth the time."
4,A Solid Start To A Promising Series,"While I've never been a big reader of fantasy lit, I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed this book, a first novel by D.A. Adams. The Brotherhood of Dwarves starts off well and gets even better as it goes along. Excellent descriptive passages and well-orchestrated action sequences abound, but Adams never loses sight of what really makes a book special: the characters. Anyone who enjoys a good, fun read should definitely give this a look."
5,I LOVED IT!,"I'm not usually a reader of fantasy, but this book goes well beyond what I expected. I feel like I've grown up with the characters. Great action, great drama, and a few unexpected twists puts this book near the top of my list of all time favorites. I just hope a sequal is in the works."
5,A Thrilling Read,"An engrossing novel from start to finish, ""The Brotherhood of Dwarves"" is full of rich landscapes, sumptuous textures, and easy-to-love characters. This is an action-packed story that manages to balance emotion and adventure. It is a gem among the stacks of newly published action/adventure novels and a great first offering from a writer who is bound to go far, and through his books, take us with him. Thank you, Mr. Adams, for a good story."
5,A Great Way to Get Your Genealogy Research Organized,"Emily Croom's Unpuzzling Your Past Workbook provides many forms for recording genealogical research. In addition, she gives examples of how to use the forms by filling them out herself to show what information should be noted and how to write it down so that you can refer back to it and not wonder what your notes mean. There are many sources of genealogical research information, but Emily does a splendid job of covering all the important topics. And the forms can be duplicated whenever new copies of them are needed. She has very thoughtfully organized her forms so that a person following her research suggestions will have, after any length of time, a great resource for turning the completed forms into a written family history. I wish that I had a copy of this book at the very beginning of my research."
5,Very nice companion to the book!,"This is a very nice companion book to ""Unpuzzling Your Past"" Geneology book. I am so happy this was also available!"
4,UnpuzzlingYour Past Workbook,Makes available multiple worksheets for recording your research if you do not have copying machines readily available. Offers means of organizing findings. Good investment to further one's research and companion to the text book of the same name.
4,OLiver Button is a Sissy It's a funny book,"Once Oliver did thing that girls did. He didn't play with boys or didn't play any spots. All he did was to play with paper dolls, pick flowers, jump rope, draw and dance. He asked his mother if he could take some dance lessons so he went to Mrs. Leah's dancing class with other boys and girls.My favortie part was when every one said he was a star at tap dancing because he has been practicing really hard at home and at Mrs. Leah's class. At home he was practicing when he got home from school everyday.Tomie made it for his mother named Flossie his mother is still alive. His mother is in her 90s.I liked it when he practiced with his black pair of tap shoes and when a girl told the other kids to leave him alone two girls said to five boys in the schoolyard."
5,Learning How Not To Be A Non-Conformist...,"When I first read this book to my library classes, I was a little curious on how they would react. Yet I was suprised to find that after the story was finished, the children cheered and clapped. There were many attentive children throughout the story and some(whom I personally believe)were wondering why Oliver was so 'different.' Maybe it could be that more than a handful of children could relate to this story. It was fun for me acting out the different parts, and the children enjoyed these visuals also. We also shared how we would feel in the situations Oliver was set in. I recommend this book to all!"
2,Apathy = Brave?,"Since when did apathy become brave and stoned self absorption become enlightenment. This book is about a woman who made one interesting decision (to travel at a young age rather than complete high school in a California suburb) and then spends the rest of the journey/book making poor and predictable decisions with the occasional foray into no decision making whatsoever. This author is extremely invested in her own image of herself as a ground breaking too-cool-for-you darling of the backpack traveling set. More like a bratty, lost, vain child."
5,The Ultimate Hip Mama,"In this memoir Ariel Gore (aka Ghost Girl, aka Hip Mama) tells of her wanderings around the globe in her teen years. The memoir is bittersweet and leads up to the birth of her daughter. Inspiring and intelligent any mama/poet/wanderer/questioner will love Ghost Girl's crisp prose and moving metaphors."
1,"My Opinion of the 56"" Westinghouse Ceiling Fan",The fan sent did not have white globes nor aged brass. I returned it and bought a Hunter.
1,Worst silcock on the market!!!,"Never, ever buy this silcock!! If you're lucky, it'll last one summer. I installed this silcock in spring of 2010 and it worked just fine for the summer. I disconnected the hose and insulated the silcock in the fall, but by mid-winter the guts had malfunctioned and I could not turn off the water. I called the 1-800 number for Mueller and they sent me a new cartridge, which was faulty. Called again, got another cartridge which worked fine for about a month. Called AGAIN, got ANOTHER cartridge which by some miracle lasted through the summer of 2011.Now that spring 2012 has arrived, I turned it on for the 1st time to water the grass and, lo and behold, it's not working AGAIN!! Only getting a tiny trickle of water when the silcock is fully open.So now I'm paying yet another plumber to get rid of this piece of trash and replace it with something more reliable.Never, ever buy this product!!"
1,crappy speakers! bad shipping!,"i bought these speakers thinking they would be good but to my surprise one speaker arrived at my doorstep broken!! the center part of the speaker, the tweeter had broken off !! i hooked up the speakers to my pioneer cd player NOT a high powered amp,,, the speaker that arrived broken was blown after about one day of use!! then the other speaker blew the next day!!! i did not even play the music loud!!! DO NOT BUY THESE SPEAKERS!!!!!"
2,Does NOT include grills as box/description state.,"I bought these speakers and checked BEFORE ordering to make sure they included GRILLS (description listed grills included.) Sadly, I opened the box and found no grills. I called Pyle and asked why the description AND box list grills as part of the product, but product packaging did not include them. The tech support guy could not give me an answer other than, ""No, they do not have grills."" I asked if they were available for purchase as an ""add-on."" Same response, ""No."""
4,"Great book, clear and concise","Government text, and writings, and so on, can be very difficult to understand, but this book clearly explains what the text means, it also is organized greatly, I would recommend this book to anybody wanting a little extra knowledge about US Government"
3,"Poor design, good quality","Stand came quickly and is high quality (sturdy joints). That said, the design pales in comparison to your classic upright stand with three legs. With this design, the guitar leans back anywhere from 30-45 degrees. It not only looks strange, but takes up more space."
4,OnStage folding Guiter Stand,"This was the easiest to put together. Just open the box, take the plastic off the Stand, unfold and place where you want it. No tools needed for this one."
5,Simple but Effective,"I bought this for my son who would always leave his guitar on the floor. It works really well and the price was a lot cheaper than from the local guitar shop. As was commented by another reviewer, it does lean the guitar back a bit so that it takes up a bit more floor space, but in my case that wasnt a problem."
4,great for acoustic guitars,the build quality is nice...i expect it to last at least 5 years with normal use.
5,"Sturdy, padded!","My son likes this stand very much! The guitar has no chance of tipping over or being scratched in this stand. Portable, sturdy, stable, and padded. Worth the extra money and glad I bought it instead of the cheaper brands."
5,Folding Guitar Stand,I bought this guitar stand for my husband. He loves it. He said it meets all of his expectations. It is very durable and will hold up nice.
5,Quality guitar stand,This guitar stand feels solid and well made. The prongs that hold the guitar are padded and there's a rubber pad at the top of the stand to keep the guitar from getting scratched. It has a wide base and is very stable so your guitar wouldn't tip over easily. I liked the first one so much I bought another one!
3,Guitar stand GS7462B,"I was looking for a small and sturdy acoustic guitar stand. This model serves my main purpose. It is sturdy and foldable.On the other hand, I would consider that it has a design flaw that could be improved. The guitar is slanted backward at an angle while being on the stand, instead of standing upright. This position creates 2 negative effects. First, the guitar and the stand together takes quite a bit of space. While the footprint of the stand is only 1 foot, the guitar has to be 2 feet away from a wall. Second, at this angle, the guitar face catches quite a bit of dust. And I suspect that more dust and dirt will enter the acoustic hole.Would I buy this stand again? Probably not because of its space hogging design."
5,It's Exactly What You Expect from a Guitar Stand,"This stand is sturdy, stable, displays the guitar nicely and protects it from marring. I am very happy with this stand!"
4,sturdy but larger than I expected,Stand is sturdy and well-constructed with quality materials. Only complaint is that it's a bit larger than I expected which inhibits it's portability. I was hoping to keep this in my backpack along with my laptop for daily use in co-writing sessions. It's too large for my Swiss Gear backpack but the stand has worked well for gigging. It works better for gigging than my older two-piece acoustic guitar stands because it's a single piece and folds flat.
3,"Quality Material, Leans a bit too far back",I like these types of floor guitar stands as nothing touches the neck. This one is made well with good material but it leans really far back. The angle the guitar rests at is further back than my other similar floor stands. It requires me to keep it further from the wall than I would like.
4,Simple and Sturdy,"This guitar stand gets the job done. It is easy to set it upbut also very portable at the same time. It's lightweightbut doesn't feel cheap and flimsy.I gave 4 stars not 5 because when you have an acoustic ANDelectric guitar on the stand at the same time, you have totinker with the angles a bit so that the necks don't hiteach other. Other than that, great buy for under 20 bucks."
3,Solid but leans back WAY too far...,"I'm not sure if they're all manufactured this way, but the leaning angle of this stand has more or less rendered it useless for me. I have similar a-frame stands by other companies, but I have to set this one 3+ feet from my wall in order to set my guitar in it. From the side it looks like it's leaning back at about a 60 degree angle!It's build fairly solid and would probably be nice if I had a ton of extra room. I need a stand that I can keep somewhat close to the wall so I'll be looking elsewhere."
4,Travel lightly!,"Before purchasing this Slik tripod, I was originally looking at another brand. The other brand cost twice as much and had no feature advantages, which made buying the Slik more sensible. In using it extensively for a five-day workshop, a two day hike and number of local outdoor shots, I've found it to be a great lightweight travel tripod. While I would not recommend it for consistent use with a Digital SLR with a heavy lense like a 200 or 300 mm, it is ideal for other lense and camera combinations. It is very quick and easy to set up, has great flexibility, and can accommodate range of locking positions."
4,umm..wrong consumer photo's,I believe that the photos supplied by a user is the Slik Professional Tripod with A.M.T. Alloy Legs...as clearly marked on the supplied images. So not so useful in evaluating the Slik SPRINT PRO 3-WAY Travel Tripod
4,"Fit my needs for a compact, solid tripid","I first walked down a line of tripods at B&H here in NYC to see and feel the real versions of the digital pics I saw on the web. Since I am primarily a video guy with several bulky but steady 'pods, I wanted something to fit in a backpack with my new Nikon still camera. This one fit the bill for me. While we would all like to find a foot-long, 3 ounce and STEADY pod - it just ain't in the works yet."
4,"Excellent product, little heavy",Really fast release and stable. My first use was in Disney theme parks and night photos was better than expected. It's little heavy because it has a metal body but not too heavy for a men. Some times you have to have special care to prepare this tripod to move the head horizontally because if you free the central tower then the head fall down.
4,A classic by a seemingly-forgotten band,"I love this album. It's bouncy and entertaining and just a little bitter at times. Bob Geldof before he got slower and more bummed-out sounding. I've had the US release of this CD before and hated the slapped-together song sequences (a mixture of their first and second albums - Mary of the 4th Form and Joey's on the Streets Again belong on their first LP, not here!). Nice to see the disc with the ""proper"" sequence! This and ""The Fine Art of Surfacing"" are Boomtown Rats classics!"
4,A Hybrid US/UK would rate 5 stars....,"...but for now, (especially since CBS in the US has deleted all the Rats' proper CD's) this will do fine. ""A Tonic For the Troops"" found the young Rats in sarcastic snide humor, willing to take on topics as timely as tabloids or as close to home as life on the dole in the classic ""Rat Trap.""So if you're willing to settle for 8 of the 10 songs that were on the US version of the CD (missing are the improved re-recording of ""Mary of the 4th Form"" and ""Joey's On the Street Again""), this is wonderful. Quite frankly, I could not live without the exuberance of ""Like Clockwork,"" ""She's So Modern,"" and ""Rat Trap."" Maybe one of these days, someone at CBS/Legacy will realize that ""Great Songs Of Indifference"" is inadequate and we'll get all the ""Tonic"" we deserve!"
4,"The original British version, not the U.S. version...","Missing (perhaps forever?) from this cd is the Rat's re-recording of Mary of the 4th Form (faster and better than the original) and, of course, the classic Joey's on the Street Again. Why the Record Company couldn't include these as bonus tracks seems unnecessarily inconsiderate and/or mindless.Nevertheless, here is the Rat's most consistent, most fun, album in all (or nearly all...) of its glory. Favorite track: (I never loved) Eva Braun."
3,This is very different from the original LP,"Two songs from the original LP have apparently been deleted -- ""Mary of the 4th Form"" and ""Joey's On the Street Again."" It wouldn't be such a big deal, but they're two of the best songs from the original. I also couldn't help but notice that the order of songs is also different, and there are more songs than the original. You can get ""Mary of the 4th Form"" on SONGS OF INDIFFERENCE, but ""Joey's On the Street"" is apparently gone for good. Sad. That was my absolute favorite Rats/Geldof tune, far superior to ""Rat Trap."" It was one of those anthem like gems with a Clarence Clemens-like sax solo that gave goose bumps. Luckily I still have this on vinyl and found the CD awhile back in a sale bin. Why do they tinker with this stuff so much?"
1,"another ""true"" story based on an unreliable account","i read this after being similarly disappointed by Keyes ""The Minds of Billy Milligan"" (i read them because i loved ""Flowers for Algernon"" also by Keyes). both ""non-fiction"" works are based on the accounts of people who have been diagnosed as mentally ill, and both accounts i feel are unreliable. in this book you learn that Claudia made up a story for police partially giving them what they wanted to hear. i believe she did the same thing for Keyes here. there is no way of knowing when she is telling the truth and when she is lying and there is no reason to believe that any more than half of what she says is true. at times she says she doesn't remember anything and at other times she gives conflicting information in great detail. either way, luckily the real killers were caught and spent the rest of their lives behind bars."
4,Good review of basics,"I bought this book, studied it, then took the EPA test and was universal certified. My average score was 94. The book's strengths are the many practice questions and practice exams in the appendix section. The questions did a good job reinforcing the reading material. The only drawbacks are some of the date and regulation (DOT and CFR) questions. I had only a few date questions and no regulation questions on the EPA test. I also think the book could do a better job explaining low pressure systems such as chillers. Overall though, I'd say this book did a good job preparing me for the EPA exam."
5,Very contemporary / unique,"I bought these candlesticks in both crimson and green and will use them at the Christmas Holiday. They are solid, heavy, machined aluminum, anodized in the aforementioned colors and made by Octate.I am very pleased with the quality, appearance and performance of these candlesticks. They could also function quite well as bud vases, although I have not used them for such."
3,OKAY,"The pic is nice, but there was a loose screw which held the fishing pole in place. We returned the first and received a replacement. Same problem. Picture is okay without the screw, but at close inspection you can see where it should have been."
5,One of the best CD's ever.,"I bought this CD from a friend used, and I have to say it is one of the best CD's I've ever heard in my life. With the molotic trance, to the happy hardcore beats, this makes the perfect trance, and raving CD. A must for all ravers, and a must for any techno collection."
4,Good Action Movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Big Brother (formerly Deodhar Gandhi) is a good action movie! Only Sunny Deol could pull this one off well. Big Brother is truly the 21st century Ziddi with lots of action (not as explosive as Ziddi but good anyways) and a different plot. Action is good for the most part (a little toning for special effects could help). This movie is a surprise hit at the BO as it really does carry a social message. Recommended for all action fans (especially all Sunny fans)!! I can give this a 9/10! Some things could have been different, but Sunny fans will like it! I look forward to many more great action movies for years to come. All the best Paaji!!"
2,Terrible...,"What happened to Sigh? After such fantastic releases as Scorn Defeat, Hail Horror Hail, and Imaginary Sonicscape they put out this trite.This is power metal. It is neither creative nor good. The production is also muddy and pretty abysmal in comparison to their past releases. All of the surreal elements of Hail Horror Hail and Imaginary Sonicscape have been replaced by annoying vocals and moronic guitar riffing. The instrumentals are bland and uninspired at best. Sigh has certainly made better music in the past, so what is the problem here.... Why did they settle for such mediocrity? If this was any other band, I would give them 1 star. However, since it is Sigh, I will give them 2 stars.Avoid this album like the plague."
2,... not that good,"The story line in this book was really good and I was interested enough to finish it. But I felt very let down by the ho-hum and luke-warm feelings in this book.I have read everything that Joan Wolf has written and most of them are extremely passionate, though not graphic. But the couples in her previous books had passionate feelings and you could feel the tension between the couples. With this book, High Meadow, I feel the story line got in the way of the relationships. There was no passion in either couple. Just like I said earlier, just ho-hum, yeah we are in love, ok that's nice. I really can not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great love story. It was a good book, because I don't think Joan Wolf knows how to write a bad book, but not anywhere near her best effort."
4,sweet but uninspired romance,"This is a sweet story about a single mom (Kate, actually she's an aunt) whose responsibilities have left her insulated and unattached and her son (Ben) who yearns for a father. The father arrives in the form of star pitcher for the World Champion NY Yankees. Daniel Montero is gorgeous, thoughtful and enamored of both mother and son. Kate is afraid of Daniel's intentions and of her attraction to this rich and famous ballplayer who may just be too good to be true. The story is too predictable to be great, but is a quick and satisfying read."
1,what was she thinking?,"How to take a good basic plot and destroy it 1) add in a shrill, annoying heroine, 2) add a beta male who is too nice 3) add a too grown/mature 7 year old child 4) add no mystery and weak villian 5) throw in an obvious ending - mix together, gouge customer with price and voila! Don't get me wrong, I love her historicals, but maybe she should stay away from contemporary novels."
1,Emotionally flat & somewhat annoying,"Joan Wolf has written some wonderful romances, but this isn't one of them. There are a lot of elements that could have been powerful and emotional - an unknown child, a mother's cancer, a kidnapping, the death of a best friend, the possible loss of a career - but except the cancer side story, all of the other elements are looked at impassionately and discarded in a few pages.I actually found this book rather annoying because of Kate, the unbelievably clueless heroine, and the long conversations that have nothing to do with the story. This book seems to ramble on about nothing. Not one of Joan Wolf's best efforts."
2,I normally love Joan Wolf but...,"This book is a rehash of Beloved Stranger, which she published in '84 (iirc). The names have been changed, but that's about the only thing. Ms. Wolf should go back to writing regencies, where she excels, and stop rewriting her old books."
1,Slow as Baseball,"Well it looks like my impression of this book agrees with the majority of the reviewers. The ending just dropped off, no good finish at all. How romantic the way the hero says to the girl of his dreams ""Shall we make love now?"" I didn't think anyone was as innocent as Kate at age 14 let alone 27. This was one of the slowest and emptiest stories I have read for awhile. What was good about it? Nothing I'm afraid."
1,Not a book that should have been sold,During reading the pages come out. The book totally fell apart and I am only half way through. Simply will have to buy another copy. This was not a salable item.
5,Clever & great illustrations,"Last year, I went to Hawaii and picked up this book for my Godson. I read it before I sent it to him and was enchanted by the story. The illustrations are so well done. Colorful and with humor. I regretted not buying more and went on Amazon to see if they had any for sale and they did! I immediately ordered another one for my nephew. Who loved his book. There is another book in the series called Popoki Incredible Adventure at the Volcano. It has been out of print. I check back every so often to see if is available. It now finally back is in print, and I just placed my order today. Can't wait to see what trouble Popoki got himself in to at the Volcano!"
2,Nice enough for a non-canonical work,"Wagner really doesn't get Wonder Woman or the Amazons, and plays too fast-and-loose with powers, attitudes, etc. Not a great piece of work."
2,Not for fans of the Dark Knight,"I am definitely more of a Batman fan than either Superman or Wonder Woman so I want to point out that this is not Batman. He's basically portrayed as a brute with a computer. And don't get me started on the kiss.It's not easy for writers to use Batman in Super hero team ups since he has no super powers, but I do get tired of him having to basically wait for Superman to come save him. I'd rather they just wrote Batman out of this story like they did in Obsidian Age.The story is ok at best but it's hard to sympathize with Al Ghul's plot. Superman is done justice. Can't really say the same for Wonder Woman."
3,"This was better than OK, but it wasn't great.","The most appealing thing about it was the Superman's characterization. Wagner captures Superman's essential nobility beautifully. Superman isn't just physically super in this story, he is kind, good, and tolerant as well...all without coming across as a goody two-shoes. Wonderwoman feeling as if she is in the presence of Apollo was a very apt comparison. Batman, on the other hand, comes across as a nearly out of control psycho. I'm used to Batman being portrayed as a grim, revenge-obsessed vigilante but here he's rude, brutal,and unlikeable. Batman fans may find this story rather offensive, in fact.This is something to buy if you are specifically a fan of Wagner's more than something you might want as a fan of one of the three main characters."
3,"Good---but short of a ""masterpiece""","3.5 stars is more like it. If you're looking for a good superhero read, with three of the greatest superheroes of all time, then snatch this one up. Wagner's writing is good, at times intelligent, at times a little campy, but this is a required combination for a story dealing with three ""gods"" that wear spandex.At times the art will blow you away, like Fleischer cartoons with highlights and more intense coloring. But toward the end you can almost see through the images, to where Wagner was pushing himself or rushing the book along. The story concludes a little abruptly, not leaving you necessarily thirsty but maybe a little disappointed.Overall though, this IS a good read, and few writers can balance these three characters together, while keeping each of them equally interesting.Bravo, Wagner."
3,Great Story vs. Man Art,"Matt Wagner's 'Trinity' was a fun story to read. However, being the avid Wonder Woman fan that I am, I was slightly disappointed in the female art. It seemed as though Wagner is making his first attempt at female superheroes. Wonder Woman turned out more as an akward man with breasts. His rendition of Artemis was also disappointing. So if you're buying this purely for Batman/Superman interest, go for it. However, Wagner's allusion to the Greek goddess Diana meeting the hunter Actaeon (replaced by Batman) in the forest was a stunning detail. I was pleased."
4,Actually Works,"Once you change out the batteries for Duracell, etc. it does a really good, quick and neat job. Bought two more after the first for different color polishes."
2,Think Twice before buying,"I let my son buy the gravedigger version in 1:24 scale...He used his own money and was very excited...It broke two days later. The truck looks tough and seems great, but the connection between the metal axel and plastic tire does not take much abuse. My son has two trucks and both have fallen apart at this same point. A plastic glue works for a few hours but then loosens again until the wheel falls off. Don't get me wrong, I love hot wheels, but these suck and all the micro toys don't work well either."
2,Madonna..you have talent....USE IT!!,"Madonna may not be the greatest vocalist in the world, but she always showed a lot of passion and personality in her voice, as well as wrote thoughtful lyrics. Unfortunately, we have not seen Madonna use her talents these past couple years. This EP is only there to remind us about the disaster known as American Life. Listen, I'm a die hard Madonna fan too...but I will NOT deny that she has gone off track."
1,Amateurish,"Madonna hit the wall long ago, but this just seals the deal. This EP makes me want to puke. I'd rather listen to Bert and Ernie from Sesame St. sing than Madonna. How dare she release such rubbish."
4,a good ep,"its good to hear these songs witha harder edge to them especially the first two tracks. i usually skip american life..its to metal for me. i love the mtv track even though most people dont. also i think ""your honesty"" would have been a great addition to betime stories..its fits in perfectly with the sound and mood of that cd. she needs to release a cd of session songs that didnt make the cut. i really think that would be a big seller for her. overall its a ep for the amount i paid. i still still american is one of her best albums ever. i think in a few years people will see that as they did with erotica."
5,I was shocked,"What a great collection of remixes. ""American Life"" is completey reworked as a hard rock song and it is tremendous! I also love what they did with ""Love Profusion."" It seems as though Madge could easily drop the electronica and go for a more hard rock sound and still be successful."
3,My Complaints With This EP,"1) Why only 4 remixes? There could of been a lot more. AL spawned a lot of awesome mixes! I wanted at least one ""Die Another Day"" remix!2) Why are all the remixes of AL material? She could have included some ""Don't Tell Me"" or ""What It Feels Like For a Girl"" mixes, too.3) There should of been an accompanying DVD of all the ""American Life"" videos- it would of made the EP sell a lot more, believe me.4) Of all the live performances, why did she have to include the horrible Britney Spears one? One from her Drowned World Tour would of been better.5) Lastly, what's up with the Gap song. Instead, she could of put the real version of ""Into the Groove"" on it, the version that has so far only appeared on the ""Angel"" single! It could of finally been on a Madge album!"
2,New Production Bring Madonna a New Sound,"Four songs from ""American Life"" get make-overs here. While they might be called radical, I wouldn't call them improvements, for different reasons. ""American Life"" is a bad song lyrically and stylistically - remixing it won't hide that. ""Hollywood"" isn't much better. ""Love Profusion,"" on the other hand, is a well-crafted song in its original laid-back, acoustic-rock-dance incarnation. The edgier rock treatment here neither detracts nor adds - it just provides another take on it, one worth a spin (in fact, I think if L. P. had been the first single, the album might have seen greater success). The rest is collector fare, nothing hit-worthy. Even her recap of ""Into The Groove"" (""Into The Hollywood Groove"") is a cheap re-do, thanks to a lazy dubbing of the original chorus with too much effects processing."
5,WOW!!! but for Madonna fans only.,"Up to this point, mixes from the American Life album have been disappointing. Remixed and Revisited has a little bit of everything.We are given some rock mixes as well a couple of dance mixes. The American Life mix is the best mix of that song. It's a very hard rock song. Your Honesty is refreshing, but I can see why it wasn't on the Bedtime Stories album. It doesn't quite fit in. And we have the Hollywood Groove which is basically an extended remix of the Gap commercial. Nice addition to the EP.Overall it won't gain Madonna new fans but will keep her old ones."
1,Your Honesty is the cut&Madonna you need Honesty nowadays,"this Re-Mix Project is flat&weak&very sad when you consider how much an Impact Madonna has had in the Dance Community.these Duets are corny to say the least.""Your Honesty"" is a cut that although dropped almost 10 years back sounds fresher than most things She has put out to Me since ""Bedtime Stories"".Madonna seems to have ran out of gas this year the Irony Her 20nth Year in the Business."
2,"...Okay, I guess","NOTHING FAILS REMIX- One of the better ones here; but not great. A tad generic-sounding. (3/5)LOVE PROFUSION REMIX- This sounds pretty cool-way more rock-sounding than the original....but not quite as good. (3/5)NOBODY KNOWS ME REMIX- They overdo it with the techno and computer effects...it sounds like a robot singing or something. (0/5)AMERICAN LIFE REMIX- This is way more rock, as opposed to techno, which was what the original basically was. It's okay. (3/5)LIKE A VIRGIN/HOLLYWOOD MEDLEY- On this track, Britney Spears is just plain embarrassing.....Christina Aguilera's powerful vocals positively put her whimpering wails to shame. And it sounds too raw; the sound quality isn't very good. (3/5)Okay, I'm getting bored with this. Anyways it isn't that great. Bye."
1,TERRIBLE,"I am a huge Madonna fan and I bought this cd. I had to go somewhere and write about it. As much as I love the American Life CD, this remix album is terrible. The remixes all sound like someone made them with their keyboard. The hollywood Gap commercial is remixed so annoyingly ...everytime the choruse comes on they put part of Missy's voice on it...they should of kept the original commercial version. The only track good on here is the Live Like a virgin/hollywood. I also here that M is using this Love profusion remix for her video...she is taking the only single that could of saved the American life album and again throwing it away like the first two singles. Dont waste your money and wait for the Nothing fails maxi single with some real remixes."
3,"Good, but could be better","I was a little disappointed in this CD...I was under the impression that artist's release CD's to release singles from that CD. I really can't see anyone of these songs standing on its own as a single. Don't get me wrong, I definitely think everyone should buy this CD only because it is Madonna but it is rather weak to me. American Life did not do too well on radio as it was, but a rock version? Nah...It just doesn't cut it. The other remixes are ok but I expected better. The unreleased song from the ""Bedtime Stories"" CD, ""Your Honesty"" is a good song for the time it was written. I do not think it would do well now. I could see ""Into the Hollywood Grove"" with Missy Elliot being played on radio. To me, it the best song on the CD."
1,Another extreme let-down,"If American Life wasn't bad enough, here she goes again!! I really wish I could get a refund on this cd, it was a complete waste of money. Only 7 singles, 2 of which were not bad. Terrible sound quality & terrible mixes!!Caution to all buyers!!"
1,Global WARMING should Melt Her Alway!,Global WARMING should melt Madonna and Britney Spears alway. This woman is making music knowing as an art form to a bunch of CRAP sounds and TRASH lyrics. Eletronic TRASH so called music by Madonna who can't sing at all makes the so called POP music a disapointmetn. This CD SUCKS and don't buy it because the now old woman MADONNA sucks in this CD. Damn I hate her so called MUSIC. GROW UP MADONNA! I wish I could give BELOW ZERO STAR to this CRAP!
3,3.5 out of 5 really...,"I enjoyed the remixes of Nobody Knows Me, Love Profusion, and especially American Life - I like the concept of hard-rocking Madonna! I really liked Your Honesty; it kinda has a retro feel to it. I hated the remix of Nothing Fails; the album version was so good, but the remix just falls flat. The Gap ad song is good as a one-minute jingle but is a waste as a full length song. The MTV performance with Xtina and Britney is just okay without the visual."
1,What A Shame,"This EP is totally disappointing from a fan's perspective. The tracks are only 3-4 mins in length and the new song ""Your Honesty"" is just bad. The bright spots on this mini-album are the songs from the MTV award show and the song Into the Hollywood Groove. The others are just edited versions from the upcoming maxi single. I suppose that M may have reached a climax in her career, especially if she thinks that the fans will appreciate this body of work. Only a hard core fan will want this so called ""art piece""."
5,Madonna Rocks!!!,"Madonna is no fool. When she realizes that sales for her latest album, American Life are slagging, she decides to release a remixed cd. Don't get me wrong, I love the woman and was very pleased with Remixed and Revisited. Here's a breakdown:Track 1-4 = these tracks are remixed with some very heavy guitar and drum work. The vocals mix well with the heavier rock music.Track 5 = the infamous kiss, this song was almost lost in the shuffle! Can I just say that Britney needs a vocal couch ASAP. Track 6 = duet with Missy Elliot (from the Gap commercials). Whoever thought of pairing the Queen of Pop with the Queen of Hip Hop is a genius...probably Madonna!Track 7 - this song had a retro feel to it, from the era of Into the Groove."
1,Madonna's Mantra: Release It and They Will Buy....,"As one previous reviewer wrote: This has ""Holiday Cash In"" written all over it. The dismal failure of ""American Life"" has sent Madonna scrambling for publicity. Hence, the ridiculous kiss with Britney and Christina. (Note to Madonna: Your ""American Life"" project was a huge failure. Get over it and move on with life. Yes, even the great and mighty Madonna CAN fail now and again.)It is interesting that one minute Madonna is kissing Britney Spears on national TV, and the next week is promoting her new children's book. Twenty years into the business, Madonna is more hypocritical than ever. Now, she is trying to cash in on remixes of a few throw-away tracks. Of course, she knows that her fan base will buy anything she puts out. Even the few hundred thousand morons who bought ""American Life"" will still buy this garbage. When will you people ever learn?"
2,Madonna Please Take Off Your Mask & Fright Wig,"Since when has Madonna turned into Herman Munster??? She's trying to look like her kissing partner Britney Spears, except Britney is far more talented and a whole lot better looking...She's become the laughing stock of the music world. Even botox can't save her fizzling career or this very embarrassing CD. Madonna can't just fart any more and sell records."
2,Oh Please! Help Me......,"Okay, first off, this albums cover is a little bit inticing you to buy such a rotten album. I don't know who gave madonna the idea of realsing such a ridiculous album. But it sure was a poor job of just putting a a few remixes here and a a few there and rather not putting som much work and getting a little more tracks into the album. I like Madonna but here, I think she's htting us all up for credits! Take my Advice it is not worth it. And I've heard better from her!"
4,"MADONNA, QUEEN OF THE REMIX","I must say, regardless of what Madonna puts out, I will buy it, and this was no exception. I always love hearing new and revamped versions of her songs, and the tracks from American Life presented here, sound rockier and edgier, which I feel is a nice change from the usual dance remixes. The remix rock version of American Life really gives the song more edge, and I would love to hear Madonna experiment more with that sound in the future. The GAP, Into the Groove, Hollywood mix I could live without, but its fun if you don't take it seriously, which I think is one of her best qualities. Madonna really can camp it up like nobodys business. You gotta love that! So this is a must have for any true Madonna fan; one that supports her always changing artistic vision."
3,definitely not an all time high for madonna,"The whole idea behind the album is really cool, but the album itself really lacks in that department. Jason Nevins' remix of ""Nothing Fails"" is much better than the original version of the song and, in my opinion, is the best song on the album. The rest of the songs really don't do the woman justice."
2,It's too late for Madonna to recover...,"It started to fall apart when thousands of tickets from the MSG shows were left unsold. That told the truth. Madonna is on the way down. The EP looked like a desperate ploy to make people forget about the terrible American Life album. It didn't work. One is worse than the other. If she could actually sing, then there may be a chance. She doesn't have a real singer's voice. A one octave is not good enough to overcome all the bad karma. It's time for Madonna to say good bye, cut her losses, and move on to another career."
3,could have been better,"The remixes here are for songs from Madonna's underrated ""American Life"" album (true fans know most of that album is a grower and is actually rather good). The remixes are alright but not as good as the remixes from earlier in her career (like Calderone's remixes for ""Frozen"" and ""Beautiful Stranger""...those are awesome). The previously unreleased ""Your Honesty"" is quite a treat. As for the rest, it's not so great. She sounds off key on the MTV performance and why on earth does Madonna want to work with far lesser talents like Missy Elliott and Britney Spears???"
2,Oh give it up!,"Madonna seriously give it up. AMERICAN LIFE was a flop, just move on. Don't keep releasing new singles, that you know are going to flop anyways. WE DID NOT LIKE THE ALBUM and very few people did. It was a failure, just move on. But no, she continues to release new singles and then this EP with remixes, which is just a reminder of what a joke her career has become. A duet with Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears? What's next? The remixes aren't even good, they show a more rock Madonna side, but since they weren't initially made to be rock songs, they certainly don't work as rock songs. Maybe next time Madonna, but you should just go away for a while."
1,Popeye The Sailor Man...,Madonna should have the second career as the popeye the sailor man impersonator.
5,MADONNA VS MOUNT SIMS!!!!!!!!,"I can't even recall how young I was when I fell in love with Madonna, true blue baby i love you.... then I liked Nirvana thenI first heard MOUNT SIMS, it was his voice that killed me, and wow! almost ten years later HE RIMEXED MADONNA!!!!! Anyone else ever remix Madonna? LEGALLY? I'll be the first to admit that the much slept on MOUNT SIMS debut ""ULTRA SEX"" is a bit wacky and it sound like a synthed-up punk disco album, but he is a sex god and funky in that jaded 6 am kinda way, so it's still hot! As far as MADONNA, she kicks album after album in a new directions... now she's touching on the HOLLYWOOD ELECTRO PUNK UNDERGROUND, cool, maybe it'll be grungy poetic hip hop next mp3.com/djvictim"
1,Madonna has Metamorphed into an Aging Cockroach,"I don't know how better to describe this annoying nuisance to pop. She's as irritating and just as dumb as this obnoxious, ready for the trash bin EP. The martians on the cover are more appealing than she is. And probably better singers. She's like one of those pesty cockroaches, you can't seem to kill. Are we doomed with her pathetic attempts to keep herself in the public eye. God, I hope not."
4,Only For Madonna's Hardcore Fans,"Hmmmmm. I don't know what to make of this EP. The rock remixes of ""American Life"" and ""Love Profusion"" is very good. But why include the corny Gap commercial ""Into The Hollywood Groove"" on this collection? And I didn't like the audio/live version of the 2003 VMA of ""Like A Virgin/Hollywood"". To me, it seems that Madonna is trying to keep ""American Life"" alive with this release. But what she should have done was remixed and reproduced that entire album and release it. But I can't knock this EP, especially the new song ""Your Honesty"" (even though she could have remixed it to today's style). I also really like ""Nothing Fails"" and ""Nobody Knows Me"" new styles. This is a good collection for Madonna's diehards. But there's nothing on this cd to make new fans."
2,Does she ever give up?,"A disapointing EP from Madonna. If AMERICAN LIFE wasn't a big enough flop, she had to release this druge. You get some average remixes and a live track, and a b-side from BEDTIME STORIES titled ""Your Honesty"". Well honestly Madonna honey, this should have stayed in the unreleased pile. You think she could just know when something is a flop and move on, but apparantely not."
5,TERRIFIC REMIX ALBUM,"I'm not a big fan of remixed albums, but I have to say this one blew me away. Madonna did it again by turning her accoustic songs from the ""American Life"" album into rock anthems. She also gives a fresh remix of her hit ""Into the Groove"" and named it ""Into the Hollywood Groove"" with Missy Elliot. The song also has lyrics from her song ""Hollywood"" and the song also appears in her commercial for Gap Jeans. There is also a live perfoemance of ""Like a Virgin"" with Christina and Britney. An additional song that was not included on the Bedtime Stories album called ""Your Honesty"". This is a must have for any Madonna fan."
3,huge madonna fan------a little DISAPPOINTED,"I always look forward to a madonna release...single, album, book...whatever...so needless to say I was pretty excited about this new ""Remixed and Revisited."" But I was let down. The remixes are average..all kinda rock remixes which makes the whole cd kinda bland. The only one that stands out to me as really fantastic is the remix to Nobody Knows Me.....it is a really great kinda retro remix...the live performance is not worth really listening to more than once and the unreleased song from Bedtime Stories cd is not really that good at all...another easily forgetable song. She shoulda stuck with the Box Set that was orignally supposed to be released!!Oh well..Hopefully the maxi-single for Nothing Fails can redeem her!!"
3,Hit & Miss,"I like the new mixes of the songs from American Life album. The song American Life got this heavy metal treatment. My main taste in music is Hip-Hop, R&B;, Dance, Jazz and Latin. So maybe I don't know what I'm talking about, but this new version of American Life is very good. Very driving and most of the lyrics are cut off, so just enjoy the ride. Other mixes are relitively better than original. Though I like the dance mix(Above & beyond) of Nobody Knows Me better.As for other tracks on this CD.....Why that VMA performance when there are so many other great sounding performances by Madonna? Without the visual? (Britney sounds horrible, but meybe like Madonna did 20 years ago) What's so good about this when you can't see the kiss?Into The Hollywood Groove is a plain joke. No worth putting through your ears.The never-heard-before Your Honesty is OK. I guess previously unreleased songs are always welcome."
2,It's too late for Madonna to recover...,"It started to fall a part when thousands of tickets from the MSG shows were left unsold. That told the truth. Madonna is on the way down. The EP looked like a desperate ploy to make people forget about the terrible American Life album. It didn't work. One is worse than the other. If she could actually sing, then there may be a chance. She doesn't have a real singer's voice. a one octave voice is not good enough to overcome all the bad karma. It's time for Madonna to say good bye, cut her losses, and move on to another career."
3,Wake up Madonna!,"I'm a huge Madonna fan. Unfortunately, 2003 proved to be one of Madonna's worst years in her 20-year career. Although the AMERICAN LIFE album became one of my favorites, it definately failed to be a success.Remixed and Revisited seemed like a really cool idea to me, and by knowing how great Madonna remixes had been in the past, my expectatives on this CD were pretty high. Unfortunately, this EP ended up being my least favorite Madonna album. There's not a connection between the tracks, everything seems misplaced. The only two good remixes are the ones for ""Nothing fails"" and ""Love profusion."" The VMAs performance, already looks dated and the Missy Elliott collaboration on ""Into The Hollywood Groove"" it's just stupid and repetitive. And well, ""Your Honesty"" it's not that bad, but not amazing either...Shame on you MadonnaHope you become more interested in your music than in your children's books or kabbalah bulls***."
2,"Works, but a little too well","This works exactly as the bottle states, but possibly a little too well. It took off so much skin that I now have painful oozing sores. Not to mention if you get even a little on any 'healthy' skin, it will take it off as well VERY QUICKLY. It was used on me in a nail place wrapped on the bottom of my heels for about 5 minutes. Unfortunately a little bit got on the top of my foot and took off that skin as well. One of the most painful experiences I have ever been through. But..now that my foot has healed (with a little scarring) the calluses are gone. So it works. But PLEASE proceed with extreme caution."
1,be very careful with this stuff,"my local nail salon used this product in a spa manicure, which meant it was on my feet for about 20 minutes, wrapped in warm towels. The soles of my feet started to burn, and now I have open sores on them which required an emergency room visit and will take about 4 days to heal. Very painful and difficult to walk. You're only supposed to use this on calluses, not the whole sole of the foot, and only for a maximum of 5 minutes. It may work fine if you use it properly, though PubMed has an article about nail changes after using it for a manicure...."
2,Nothing new!!!,"When I first heard about this DVD I was pretty excited. So I purchased it thinking it was a brand new, never before seen biography of the band. Since it was released in 2006, you would think that it would be new. Well anyway, when it arrived I rushed to put it in a watch it right away. Little did I know that this was a re-creation of something already released.This DVD is actually the Kornography DVD (the biography with the red cover) with a different name. Anyone who was looking into getting this and already has Kornography, save your money. Their is absolutely nothing new on this!I only gave it 2 stars because, even though it is a decent biography, i'm still a bit mad that I wasted money on something I pretty much already had!!"
4,definitely some hotness....,"All of the stories, thankfully, are written by women/womyn who know and respect the beautiful love (and sometimes lust) that only 2(+) women can share. All of the stories are well written and for the most part tasteful. A little more strap-on/trans tales than I was expecting, but I can look past those parts n enjoy the rest. Fun and sexy. Very hot book!! Mmmmmm....hehe. ;D"
5,Glad I picked this up ...,"I just had to read the story titled ""There Really Is a Kalamazoo"" by Therese Szymanski. From this author I figured it was going to be well written and sexy, I was right.A few of the standout authors -Aunt FannyAmie EvansCrystal SincoffKristina WrightWendy CasterRachel Kramer BusselRakelle ValenciaTara AltonI am so happy I didn't miss this collection of 30 stories by a wide variety of authors."
4,Good for touchups,"Bought the white marker (1 marker) for touching up minor nicks and scratches. My walls and furniture are all white, these seem to do a decent job. The tip is rather fat so don't expect to be able to get into corners. I used it on several of my white lacquer furniture pieces - you'll probably have to apply a few applications for it to hide darker marks but it dries within minutes so not that big a hassel."
2,"Be cautious, if you want to spend the money.","Yes, as claimed, comprehensive and easy-reading. BUT, a lot of mistakes and out of date materials. For example: Community acquired = nosocomial (Does he know English? Well at least he didn't proof read it.) 1st choise for community acquired pneumonia = penicillin (Wake up, this is 2001) AND, some useless topics. It is otherwise a helpful resource. But with all these mistakes, you have to be cautious. It may help you lose some points. And it is very expensive."
1,worst book in my life,"this book is worst bok with lot of out of date material....swason`s family practice is a good supplimentary book to other books.....especially the 4th edition,,go ahead and take it for step 2 and step 3 dont worry about money...u can always sell it ....You will like swason`s so much that u will be not willing to sell......"
3,Dog figurine,"The figurine of the Austrailian Shepherd was much smaller than I thought it would be. The description gave the height of ""about 2 1/2 inches tall"" when in actuality it was less than two inches. I thought it would be about the size of a lemon but it was actually the size of two grapes. I gave the figurine to a woman who had recently and unexpectedly lost her Australian Shepherd Dog during what should have been a brief illness. The figurine did look like her dog so it was a good likeness of the breed. I just wish it hadn't been so tiny."
5,ECCO shoes,"Great shoe. High quality. My husband, who has to walk a lot as a high school principal, likes them so much that he has them in both brown and black."
5,Only Dress Shoes I buy,I am on my feet all day in a professional atmosphere so it is important to have a dress shoe that is both handsome and comfortable. Ecco Berlin Bicycle Toe Slip On does the trick.
2,Meh,"Season One of Jericho was a wonder, full of human-interest, high tension, good writing, and a touch of conspiracy. Season Two failed to measure up, right from the start. Many characters from the first season are missing, and the show has a much stronger sense of claustrophobia, rather than the expansive solitude of the first. To make matters worse, the writers seem to fall into the ""didn't have a plan"" trap that plagues so many of this style of show.This is worth watching as closure for fans of Season One, but only just barely."
2,Where's the beef?,"This series met a tragic end, died before it's time. The secone ""Season"" is only like 7 or 8 episodes, and they had to cram so much into the few episodes they had the whole thing felt rushed. It really needed another 8 episodes to end correctly."
5,Great show... wish there was more...,This show was awesome. It was as addictive as 24. I couldn't believe they cancelled the show in the 2nd season.There were so many unanswered questions and so much on the coming war that could have been covered. It really kept us going to the end. I think they should revive this for a season three and promote it properly.
5,Great show -- gets better with each episode!,"Season 1 of ""Jericho"" had one of the most unique, engaging premises ever seen on TV, and I was hooked instantly -- as are dozens of my friends and family members. Then, along comes Season 2, and BAM! It's more power-packed than its predecessor. There are no words to describe how this show will pull you in and make you care about the residents of Jericho! If you haven't checked it out yet, don't waste another minute."
5,AMAZING...but short,"This season was good (though I missed Johnston). I wish that it was more than 7 episodes, but those 7 did not disappoint. It did feel a bit rushed, but under the circumstances it was great. They need to bring this back in the form of a movie or an extension of an ENTIRE season. I can not believe that this show got taken off the air! Overall, totally worth it."
4,Love it!!!,"Jericho is an awesome tv show that has all the elements of what a tv should be and more. Do yourself and favor and buy this I promise you , you will LOVE it."
4,Jericho,"This is such a great show - too bad it was cancelled. Still hoping one of the cable channels will pick it up.The final show was written in an amazing way - still open ended, but you at least have answers.I love Gerald McRaney, which is why I first watched the show - still crying over that loss. Skeet Ulrich is such a good/bad/good guy. Anything with either of these actors can't really miss. The bond between them was wonderful.I thought the writing and the sometimes-not-the-best-acting, were much better & solid in the second season than the first.This was a twisted, never ending, surprise around every corner, amazing series."
3,Jericho final season for good reason,"I enjoyed the first season of Jericho but perhaps it was because of the novelty of the story. The second and final season was not so good. I blame the directing and writing because the actors should have been great. The level of emotion was always the same no real highs and lows, absolutely no humor."
5,"BEST SHOW ON TV JERICHO,BETTER THEN MOST MOVIES!","CBS Is truly NUTS.. The first season was a masterpieceI mean anyone who does not have the the Season 1 box set GO GET IT.you will never see a better pair on the small screen then Jake and HawkinsBut here we are CBS canned the show again(WTF) whoever is in chargethere is really stupid Jericho is a phenomenon and CBS is plain stupid.JERICHO SEASON 2 rocks even harder , Season 2 is like season 1but high on steroids i mean what a fantastic showSEASON 3 needs to be picked up by another network"
5,All time Great TV series,"Absorbing storyline; Fast-paced, action packed adventure. Nice DVD with some good extras for one of the best television programs in years. Great cast - maybe a little too much for television."
2,"Great Show, but poor packaging","I'm not arguing that this is a great show, but this is a review about the product, not the show, people.Compared to the first season, which came in a nicer box set, this comes in a no frills plastic DVD case of which the CDs can easily float around and get scratched either during shipping or normal handling.Thumbs down on this one, but what other choice do you have if you want the second season?!"
2,jericho season 2,Didnt enjoy it even half as much as the first season but i just had to watch it for the characters. Not recomended.
2,2nd Season - what a disappointment,"The First season of Jericho was mesmerizing - well-written, well-acted, full of heart and courage. The truncated Second season, though, is full of paranoia, betrayal and corruption - and that's just the script writers; we haven't even gotten to the show yet.Seriously, the storyline here is like Bush Derangement Syndrome writ large: a private contractor Jennings & Rall (read Haliburton) comes in to town with its own private army named Ravenwood (Blackwater) headed by a Dick Cheney lookalike.Please, just because a network can write rehashed, leftist junk doesn't mean it should. CBS ruined a perfectly good show, a great show really, just to get their political licks in. Then they canceled it.Good riddance."
2,great series - but $40 for 7 episodes?!,Loved the show. Bought Season 1 and was OK with the price for 22 episodes.Season 2 has 7 episodes and the cost is $40?! Say what?!
3,Cancelled for good reason,"Jericho didn't suffer horrible ratings because it's the masterpiece these fanatics would lead you to believe, although season two was better than the first.Buyer beware."
3,Wish it was longer.,"First off, I'll fill you in briefly that I have been overseas for awhile and just returned, so if I'm missing something of why the second season was only 7 episodes, then I applogize in advance. I felt what alot of other people felt. I think the season was rushed, had way too many plot holes, and overall was a average season, not great like the first season. What happend to Dale? What happend to the seemingly huge plot point of John Smith? Maybe this was all part of the writer's strike I read about. I don't know. I bought it to complete my series, that's the only reason."
4,Everything but the band,"Just got my watch today in the mail. I read the reviews before making the purchase and I can say that I'm happy with the purchase. The only thing I don't love is that the band is a little flimsy. Overall, the watch has great weight, and it feels sturdy, but the band just feels a little light. Other than that it seems to be a really good watch. And I haven't figured out how to set the alarm yet, but I'm sure I will."
3,Almost a great watch,"I've had my SNA225 for several years now and have only one, but substantial, complaint. The watch looks great, has a heft and style that are comparable to watches costing 10 times the price. I use the chronometer function often - it has been an excellent feature and the quartz movement keeps flawless time. The face is simple and clean and even the small registers are easy to read. The lume on the hands on mine has begun to dim after several years.However, because the watch lacks a screw-down crown, the crown can and does pull out, stopping the watch. Numerous times this has left me in a lurch with a very nice looking bracelet and having to dig out my cell phone to know what time it is. If Seiko had given this watch that one feature, I would recommend it completely."
4,Very good watch,"This is a very good watch and I'm happy with it. The only issue I've had till now is that I've had the crown pop up by itself two times, which messed up the time. May have been caught by my clothes or I don't know what. But this is really a minor issue; I would gladly recommend this watch to anyone."
1,Beware Of Its Proprietary 21mm Lug-Ends!,"21mm lug-ends... well screw that!There's no good, only bad, corrupted, corporate, and not aesthetic reasons for not using a standard interval a 22mm lug-end for this watch!It really would be worth the purchase, and SEIKO might have actually looked as if they cared about the watch community if they had chosen lug spacing that accommodates industry standard lug spacing sequencing in even two millimeter intervals - 24mm, 22mm, 20mm, 18mm, 16mm, 14mm, 12mm et al. But rather than do that they put it all in the proprietary ""fashion"" watch category.What's next, rein stones on the bezel, or maybe some more of their cheep diver-look ""fixed"" unturnable bezels... what a waste of resources!"
3,Nice pictures,"Very nice pictures of a variety of cars. Not artistic photos like Dennis Adler presents, but clear photographs against a blank white background. Not a lot of substance in the written material, but the photographs are worth the price of admission.My one criticism involves the rather broad choice of cars. The cars are presented alphabetically, rather than being organized thematically. It would not have taken a great deal of effort to provide some sort of overview information that helped illustrate the evolution of car design within this period, rather than just present an apparently random collection of cars.Finally, I was hoping to see more of the glamorous cars from the 30s, and there were some surprising omissions (such as the Le Baron Cadillacs) from this period."
3,Danny Wood is back in action,"I listened to some samples of ROOM FULL OF SMOKE,and I think the music itself sounds great but why don't we hear any words. Maybe it's just because they are samples but I myself won't buy a C.D. with just music-we want lyrics baby!"
2,It's alright,"D:Fuse's ""Room full of smoke,"" is alright for sitting around with some friends but anywhere else it's useless. forget about this mix of Hip-Hop, latin, funk, etc. Just stick to one rhythm, because he doesn't have any of them down too well. I respect him as an artist, but the music doesn't touch a cartain feeling nor mood. Forget about this album, because it's nothing special."
4,Not exactly cinnamon.,"This will freshen the air. It does seem to remove,not just mask odors. But as far as smelling like cinnamon. Hmm, not so much. Smells more like plastic than anything."
5,Enter into an atmospheric mind trip through the void,"Sleep Chamber is one of the least known but most creative bands around. People think heavy metal is scary. This album will take you into ancient places of darkness. This music creates a mood and tears down the veil of reality. Active listening is required. Out of all the hundreds of cds I own, this one has been loaned out more times than any. People can't get enough of it from deadheads to metalheads to punks to pop music fans. This is an experience. Excellent for meditation. Dark meditation to the hidden realms of the human condition. Nothing is as original as sleep chamber. This is my favorite album. Think Buddhist monks chanting, tibetian horns blow, electronic noise, think Edgar Allen Poe's ""Telltale Heart"" read in the middle of this serene cacophony. You have to hear it to believe it! Music beyond any and all classification. Buy it and experience it today."
1,stinko,"This video was really bad. Get Emperor of the Sea instead, just check all the discs right away to make sure they all work. Mine didn't."
4,Nicely done,"A thoroughly entertaining romp through Santa Fe, from the local watering holes to the mayor's office at City Hall. Loads of laughs, loads of blood, and a great ending."
4,Great Talent,"Does the world really need another zombie movie? You bet it does! In an age of slick, ""corporate"" zombies, this locally grown movie captures the true essence of zombies. Don't miss the horror, great makeup and the spooky locale of Santa Fe as you have never seen it. Can there be a sequel? You'll want one by the time you get to the end."
3,ALWAYS KNEW THE MAYOR IS A ZOMBIE!,Great views of the local scene at 2nd St. Brewery and the Cowgirl - saw some faces we recognized - it's a fun little romp that locals and others who love Santa Fe will enjoy. Enjoyed seeing SFPD chasing zombies on Guadalupe St. Hope this flick encourages other independents to make films.
3,Zomedy,"This was cute. I liked it.It was budget, but any real zombie fan is used to this.It was sort of Seinfeld meets a Sante Fe Tourism public service announcement.Bottom line is, if you get the humor, you will like this. If you don't, you won't."
1,BEYOND TERRIBLE!,"I'm nearly speechless. After reading the great reviews, I was excited! This was truly the most pathetic attempt at a movie I have ever seen. I'm no critic and I can not only endure but ENJOY most ""B"" rated films. It ranked at about a Junior High School play level as far as the acting...and I have to say I've seen Junior High plays that were better! I sincerely believe I could have written a better script than this myself. I made it 20 minutes through, and it was a painful 20 minutes at that, but I knew after the first 10 I was wasting my precious time. But you know how it is...you always think it's going to get better. Well it didn't. I've now lost most of my belief that taking time to read the reviews is worth it. The word ""Pathetic"" is really the only word that best describes this flick."
5,Will not disappoint,"At 4 or 5 bucks a disc, this is quite a deal for performances of this caliber. The Prazak Quartet has been drawing accolades and might be the finest contemporary Czech Quartet (perhaps tied with the Panocha). Their style might characterized for its unanimity in performance, a lovely blending of sound, and a lyrical delivery with a 'rightness' in the ebb and flows of rubato. Clear modern sound doesn't get in the way of the music or offer many distractions of fingers rubbing on strings or breathing sounds. Hopefully more of their recordings will see a broader repacking/redistribution in the US."
3,good idea... but,"My cats were more interested in destroying this liner once they realized it's there. They moved all litter to one side and spent a while trying to rip the bag to shreds... in the end i still had to clean up everything manually. I think with the bag it's even worse. I'm sure it's great for some cats, but not mine."
3,Good but Could Be Better,"Pros:-Draw String-Large Enough to Fit Bigger Sized Cat Litter Boxes-Actually made for Cat Litter Box unlike Tidy Cat's product which is no different than a cheap 20 gallon garbage bagCons:-My Cat Rips the Bag Up and causes the liner to leak sand. Bags need to be made more tear resistant-Only 5 bags per box, why not 25?"
5,Jonny Cat,"Jonny Cat is the best litter box liner, if you have a large cat box. I couldn't fit my box with anything but Jonny Cat. Jumbo worked perfectly"
4,Pleats a problem,"These are excellent liners for all the reasons already stated. My one problem is that our cats urinate at the front of the box & the litter gets caught there & is damp or turns to ""mud"" & is difficult to remove, hence the odor is left. Is there any other way these liners can be re-designed?"
5,The best litter liners,I only use Jonny Cat liners because they are thick and sturdy. The other brands I have used tear or get holes in them when I scoop out my cats litter.
5,Good Product,"Had some trouble finding well made, heavy duty liners until I came across this one. Highly recommended!"
3,da brat,"dem franchize boyz are a really lame group from atl and are a poor representation of what atl has to offer. the beginning of the song is pretty bad cuz of dfb and their chorus is wack. but then bow wow comes on, hes ok but hes still young in the rap game. and then da brat comes in with a fu*king killer punchline and a great chorus its like comparing her to william hung. overall the song is good because of da brat but dfb is terrible go out and get something good from atl like t.i., ludacris, shawnna, and of course if you dont own da brat's music you have to get that."
2,not a bad club song,"best part is the remix and that's because of jd, brat and bow wow but that sucks too."
2,Graphic Artists Gone Wild,"Lots of photos and the pages look great, but the publishing house seems to have left the real writers out of the loop. If you want to compare hotels, find a good restaurant or an off the beaten path adventure, other guides are far better."
4,Not the best; but not the worst either!,"When I plan to travel to a place, I read more than one travel guide and learn everything I can about a place. Frommers and Fodors books are usually my favorite; some are them are not as great as others. This travel book has wonderful color photos throughout and lots of useful information. It isn't the best travel guide on Florida, but it isn't one of the worst either."
5,Best beans and rice ever,"For some unknown reason our local supermarkets stopped carrying the Sante Fe style pinto beans & rice. Luckily, I was able to locate them here and bought a case. They make an excellent side dish or add sausage for a hearty meal. Best beans & rice I ever tasted!"
5,does what it says,"No experience on how long it will hold up yet, but after spraying it on new exhaust wrap, it definitely ""seals"" it all together. It also allows me to touch it with my arm and not get it full of fiberglass."
4,Thompson is my surragate family.,"This is one of the ones I started with. Put to screen, fairly well I might add. All of Thompson is fantastic. Great ""cosy"" hard-boiled books. The only thing cosier might be Twin Peaks. Dig em'.After Dark, My Sweet"
3,A good intro to Thompson's dark world,"One of the most suspensful books in recent memory. Every time you get lulled into a sense of security, Thompson hits you with a haymaker square in the nose. The plot is clever and filled with so many twists and turns that you forget about the stereo-typed ""tough guy"" characters."
1,Problems,"I have had continual problems with this light. I have replaced the bulb, then the day/night sensor. The new bulb lighted once. After replacing the sensor the new bulb litup again. The sensor humms but no actions. I even tried the Regent lighting website and Cooper but could not get a drawing to bypass the sensor. Someone told me they had the same problem and it gave them fits until they put a timer on it and bypassed the sensor. That person is not available to tell me how the wired past the sensor for the timer. ???????"
3,HI I'M NOT DEAD YET,"SAW THE SCREAMIN ONE CIRCA 1988 W/ @ THE PROFIT BAR W/ REV. HORTEN HEAT AS BACKUP BAND. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT THAT NIGHT. BEST TO START WITH THE BASICS ""SPELL"" AND OTHERS."
4,Superb graphic adventures in WWI African Theatre,"Corto Maltese, worldy-wise adventurer, travels through the Africa during World War I in this neat set of tales by the late Venetian cartoonist Hugo Pratt.Corto rides with Lawrence of Arabia to Tuban in the first tale, where a group of British prisonners are being held by the Turks. Next he is at a British outpost in North Africa when it is overwhelmed by Arab warriors. His comrade from the previous adventure, the Danakil warrior Cush, rescues him and the pair travel to Ethiopia where an aged sorcerer - or fallen angel? - helps them resolve a dispute between the parents of a Moslem boy who loves a Christian girl. Finally Corto winds up in East Africa, where he avenges the murder of the brother of an old comrade with the aid of an African secret society.Pratt's style is not for everyone - the graphics are somewhat crude, but have a subtle appeal. The stories are little gems, however, and display an aesthetic unique in comic books."
4,DOESN'T FIT,THE LAMP IS BEAUTIFUL BUT THE BULB THAT WAS SENT WITH IT WAS ABOUT ONE-HALF INCHES TOO LONG. I HAD TO GO OUT AND BUY A SMALLER BULB. SEEMS LIKE POOR QUALITY CONTROL.
1,Poor Quality,This item came in a unpresentable state. I wouldn't display it anywhere in my home due to its dirty and dingy color and quality. The power cord it came with was smashed to pieces and unusable. I've seen similar lamps from other sellers in much better condition. Check out another source if you want a quality salt lamp. VERY disappointing
4,Meets expectations,"Good introductory sections. Helpful in establishing historical context. Professionally rendered. Intense and dense material, but appropriate for the topic. Glad I bought it. My first reading of Adam Smith, so I cannot compare to other editions."
4,Luther's Attack on Indulgences,"Luther's Ninety-Five Theses were written in direct response to the practice of selling indulgences in the 1500s. This book begins with an introduction explaining the circumstances under which Luther posted his theses. It does a good job of quickly explaining the main points one needs to know before reading the theses. There are sporadic footnotes in the text to clarify some points. I have a protestant background and found Luther's topics to be techincally Catholic. However, I did not feel lost in my reading. It would be of a great advantange to have some knowledge of the Catholicism of the time. The theses mark the start of the Reformation, and a read-through would be beneficial for any student of history or Protestantism. The book itself is very short (18 pages). Luther's Ninety-Five Theses are readily found from any internet search, and this may be a much more cost-effective option. The introduction may be the only benefit of actually buying this edition."
5,To understand the Reformation,"This book is a key document for all those (students, professors, ministers, scholars) who are interested in understanding the Reformation from its very beginning. Which were Luther's (and many theologians' and clerks') demands at the beginning of the 16th. century? The major answers to this question are in this booklet, written by the great Reformer's own hands."
5,historical and theological beauty,"The language of these is not easy to read, but beautiful to consider. We take most of these ideas for granted, or try to make more out of them than was included in these theses. The historical and personal risk Luther took to post these on the doors of his church should inspire and humble us all.The 95 theses began the reformation of the Christian faith. Up to the point of these writings, the Church had been largely unchecked in her errors. Debates may have stayed private, were it not for a courageous minister. Luther did not intend to leave his beloved church, but hoped to change the ideas and behaviors which distracted her from the word of God.These were posted on a church, for the church, but their impact has reached to the farthest corners of modern hearts."
1,I wrote a bad review and Amazon deleted it,"Since it is next to impossible to contact Amazon I will do this. I wrote a bad review, a very bad review for this book which is sent by Amazon. My review has been deleted by person or persons unknown. I charge Amazon with interference and expect them to contact me to explain this action."
3,sex pistols images,"sex pistols imagesthe photographer is not a great one here, most likely early in his career, but for a visual documentary of the pistols, this is a decent book."
2,"Death on arrival, had to get a replacement","The first one I received would not charge at all. I sent it back and Amazon promptly replaced it. The new one seems to be working OK so far, although I've only had it for a couple of days."
5,Great stuff to get lots of green,"This plant food will help your plants grow and get lots of green. However, if you are looking for blooms, once your plants get more mature, you will do better to cut the nitrogen and get more phosphorus.Miracle Gro Bloom Booster is the right formulation to feed already grown plants to get them to bloom often and with large blooms.I use both foods, but at different times of the year.The labels of each will give you the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash."
3,"Good product for peppers, house plants, etc BUT...","..... Buy this same thing at Wal-Mart for $8.95 Lowes sometimes has a good price too. My local Ace Hardware had this on special a while back for $7.99, don't know what it is now. In other words, if you only have a few plants-this will last forever and maybe the conv. of having it delivered is worth the price. But if you're like me and have more than a couple plants, pick it up when you're out and about.For any begining organic growers, this is fine stuff but its synthetic. But there is plenty of fairly reasonable, good organic fert. out there for you. DON'T be conned into over paying. I can't believe the $$$ some places charge for organic fert. You can make great stuff in your yard or even on your balcony or patio if you are a apt/condo dweller. Take care & Good gardening!!"
2,Good product - price too high,"This is a good product but Amazon's price is too high! Found same product, same size at 2 garden stores yesterday for $9.97."
5,feed your plants,This works great to feed all my potted plants and hanging baskets. Just a tablespoon or two in each can of water and I can be sure my plants will be well fed. Buying the large size is way more economical too.
5,It is a Miracle,I love this product. It makes everything grow so incredibly fast and lush. I use it on all my herbs and flowers.
4,doing the best we can...,"I loved Ariel's new book. It came just at the right time, as I mourn the loss of my ""baby"" and am learning to embrace this new developing woman-child in my house.Best:--Normalizing that the process of teen differentiation can be painful and difficult, as well as rewarding. We (parents) are not alone! It's not just me!!--The research to dispell fears & myths about teen, presented in clean and clear (and even funny) format--Reminder that the author is a ""human mama-woman doing the best I can"". It really helped remind me that I am too!"
1,Just Don't!,"The base is oversized and will not fit into an area that is sized for a standard outdoor flood fixture. There is no tension adjustment for the bulb arms. I had to wedge cardboard into the pivot area to keep them from always dipping down. The sensitivity is a three position switch not a potentiometer. No setting works well. Turned on falsely, repeatedly every nite. Photocell would periodically short out leaving lamp on in daylight. Motion sensor would short out periodically as well leaving bulbs lit all nite. Tried every setting, reading pamphlet over and over. Called company. (They make really good outlets and switches by the way.) No relief till I threw it into the trash and replaced it. You've been warned."
2,Cooper Lighting MS600W 180?,The range of the sensor less then 180 degrees.It deosn't turning off automatically after perselected time.
3,"great fuses, overcharged for shipping","These fuses are the exact replacement part I needed. However, they were glass fuses mounted on a cardboard backing. They arrived in a small box, which doubled the shipping fee. They could have easily been shipped in a small padded envelope."
5,Excellent value,"Fuse is an identical replacement for the original fuse that comes in the Fi-Shock electric fence product. Fuses arrived quickly, and delivered in perfect condition. Price is an excellent value."
1,Doesn't work with 3G,"EForcity has a serious problem with terrible descriptions.This charger absolutely will not work with a 3G iphone. The description is still not fixed, even months after people raised this issue.This seller is fraudulent in my view - leaving up this known wrong description."
1,didnt work,bulb changer didn't work. It would not fit around the flood light.Had to push really hard to just get one side of the product around the bulb. Didn't go any further in fear of breaking bulb. Would not recommend.Bought a step ladder for the same price.....worked.
3,Karen,Great idea. Good for emergency. We use it in our mountain storage shed where there is no electricity. Light is not the best but it serves the purpose.
5,"Been there, done that","""Travel Alone & Love It"" is a welcome addition to my travel bookshelf. I refer to it before every trip. From the ""idea"" of a trip to the arrival at destination, every question is answered. Chapters on Travel Insurance and Jet Lag are especially helpful. As a Solo Senior Traveler I found this book to smooth the path and I am eagerly awaiting the next book by Sharon Wingler."
4,Provided great tips on how to be prepared - for everything!,"I found this book to be very helpful - everything from tips on how not to look like a tourist, to packing and later - dealing with jet lag. Wingler is really straightforward and honest - not afraid to admit her mistakes and misfortunes so that others will not follow in her footsteps!"
2,travel alone and love it,"I consider myself modestly traveled but have never traveled alone. I found this book to be too basic, containing information that can be gathered easily with minimal effort in any bookstore, common sense, or by experiencing a minimal amount of travel. I would not consider it a valuable travel reference book."
2,Travel Alone & Love It : A Flight Attendant's Guide to Solo,"I would not want to say this is a useless book, but if you have common sense you do not need it. It tells you what to take with you , but if you sat down and thought things for 5 minutes you would arr8ive ate the same result . Medicine take what you usually need; and unless you are going to the back of beyond you are going to find a pharmacy. I bought this book and no I wonder, if this lady can be an author, any one can ."
4,Simmins Beautyrest Sleep Massager,The Beautyrest Sleep Massager is a quality product. The Sleep Massager is priced right.It is easy to install. It has multiply speeds and modes. It does a fine job of massaging you to sleep before it shuts it's self in 20 minutes.
3,Worth the price,"If you've had a Somnus Massage mate from AVANT and are looking for something like it...this is the closest your gonna get. Although it is not as powerful and has half the features it is the only thing available out there that would be something like a Somnus. I have a waterbed and ive read that if you use it on a waterbed to put padding under the wands or else they will be very noisy. Overall it is OK, but i do like it being that it has the same various massage settings and a sleep timer. I have a king size bed and you do need to buy 2 units. One set for each side.Overall...it's worth the price!"
5,best rest for an over work body that don't rob the purse,"After working graveyard for so many years I needed something to help me sleep doing the day after trying the massager under my matteress I could not sleep. So I went online to fine me another one. There was the simmons beautyrest sleep massager, it strong, powerful, and give my husband and myself just what it takes to put tried body to sleep with just enough not to make you want to live without it. In fact as soon as our money get beter we will be ordering another one so that we get the full effect of both of the massager on one side of the bed. In case you didn't get it they are well worth the money."
2,weak,I am disapointed with this product because it is not very strong. I can feel the vibration but it will not massage a cramp out or relax a sore back. Just a pleasant hum under the mattress.
3,Simmons Beautyrest Sleep Massager,Works pretty good but you need two for a full size or bigger if you want more than a hum on high speed.
2,It was a great idea!,"I had a built-in vibrator in my last 'water' bed and I loved it! Now I have an adjustable air mattress and I thought I would try this product in it and enjoy falling asleep surrounded by gentle motion waves..... well, it didn't work well at all. It was very noisy and the vibrations are very suttle through the air mattress and do not travel up your head and down your feet. I would probably like it if I had another water mattress, but not air. I returned it. I'm not sure what it can do in a spring mattress, might be worth the try."
1,FIRE HAZARD!! Vibrating wands melted.,Don't use under a memory foam mattress unless your fire insurance is paid up and you've got a smoke alarm. The plastic melted around both motors and they stink with that burnt ozone smell.
1,It's as gentle as a cats purr.,"The photo of this item isn't very clear. What you get are 2 plastic vibrator heads, each about the size of a cable TV remote, that you slip under your mattress and control with a little keypad. The effect is rather underwhelming. Very mild, not much more than a cell phone on vibrate. And that's when it's used on a not-so-thick innerspring full mattress. Unless you want something that's subtle almost to the point of being a bit annoying, skip it."
4,I LIKE IT BUT WASN'T BLOW AWAY WITH IT.,I LIKE IT BUT WASN'T BLOW AWAY WITH IT. IT'S KIND OF NOISY BUT IT IS NICE TO VIBRATE THE STRESS AWAY FOR A LITTLE. KIND OF LIKE PUTTING THE BABY ON THE DRYER TO CALM THEM DOWN. LOL .
3,Not bad,"This product works well, produces strong vibrations for one person. I'm not sure it does anything to make me sleep better, but it feels kinda OK. Makes a small lump underneath you, and some buzzing noise."
2,not up to the original mopes or the legendary mopeds,"These tracks are pretty amusing pop especially babydoll and she fell for me, but not up to the real mopes also known as the mopeds. An electric duo from the east coast usa broke up in 1987, blasted crazy punk rotted psychedelic grooves and ironic bombast. See a new site dedicated to their memory for free mp3's ( www.themopes.com ) and compare for yourself. The old dive bar heroes or the new fresh faced punk popsters."
4,WOWOWOW,"This is not a perfect game. The main flaw is that it is a short game. Some would say the other flaws are that the solo game is meh and that the game is too easy. This is probably coming from 30 year old men. kids will love this. It is light, and very fun. The action puzzles aren't too hard to figure out. THe game actually lets you play with two players at once throughout the entire game. This is perfect for siblings. Not unlike lego star wars for two players. Mr. Fantastic is by far more fun to play, but playing as Frozone ain't to shabby. Bottom Line: If you are looking for a fast paced great two-player game. THis is it. Buy it Now."
4,Great selection of different teas inside,"This sampler has a diverse selection of teas inside, so you won't get bored trying the different kinds. Plus they're organic."
4,"works as it said, good product.","This is a cheaper product, in fact is, As suspected, a chinese product, but the quality is OK, it owrks as it say, the best is this one no requieres batteries is only solar feeding in fact feeded with the arc light, so when you start to weld it activates instantaniusly, a very fast response, maybe not in a 1/25000 of sec. but faster enought, the inside and outside covers shields are made from polycarbonate and is good to ask for a internal and external set.I'm ok with this plastic helmet, not fancy as expensive ones but ok to do home improvements, hobby and time to time hardwork."
4,"Ok, but not variable adjustable on switch time/sensitivity","I paid aliitle more for this one because it has a slightly bigger window than the cheaper ones...What I didn't like about it is that the ""Switch time (sec.): 1/25,000 and Adjustable Sensitivity: Yes"" is only andjustable with a switch , not a knob, to only high/low...i guess in my research that feature might have been available on the cheaper models, but i would have lost a 1/2"" on view area....so it's a comprimise...I did like that they gave me an extra clear shield, and bought from them because i figure it would be able to get parts easier for it than the the cheaper ones (this is a real tool store), and they sent me a nice thick catologe"
5,SUPER AWESOME,"MY BROTHER LOVED IT WHEN HE OPENED IT! THE AUTO DARKENING IS AWESOME, IT EVEN WORKS WITH INSIDE LIGHT! AS A GIRL I DIDNT KNOW THAT."
3,Uncertain,I have not been able to use this product since the welder that I ordered at the same time is not going to ship. The order for the welder has been cancelled and no substitute was offered so I requested that Amazon credit my account for this item and have a call tag issued so I may return it.
3,helmet,this helmet works great the only complaint I have is the window is very small but besides that the helmet is well worth the money
4,Ok product if you know what to expect.,"The item works as expected...BUT...Let me start from the beginning, I went to hardwire a radar detector and had originally order the normal size fuse add a circuit. That item arrived with spare spade connectors and and a bunch of spare fuses. This was great until I popped the fuse panel on my truck and realized it took the mini low-profile fuses. Uh oh. So I ordered this item. It arrived, with nothing else. The picture shows fuses, didn't come with any. Problem? Well sort of, because my vehicle takes the low profile mini fuses which do NOT fit in this add a circuit, since the contacts do not extend down. Back to the auto parts store for some some regular mini fuses to replace the one I pulled, plus one for the new circuit. In the end it works as expected, but I wanted to point out to people what they should expect so they aren't running back and forth to the store for different fuses."
4,will make job easier,"I have used similar products before.When wiring aftermarket products in cars or trucks, this is the product you want to have."
3,Not for all vehicles,This looked to be a great product. But it would not fit in the fuse box on my 2006 Ford F150. The fuses in my truck are recessed well into the fuse box housing and the lead wire on the side of the ad-a-fuse would not allow it to be inserted.
4,Read product description carefully !!,"This was my first mistake,, always read!! I wanted the fuse holder that took the standard size fuse for older vehicles , but got one for mini fuses.. Not worth the time or postage to return, so it's in my don't fit anything pile now."
1,Poor customer care,wellll I would have been really happy if the customer service staff wasn't so well lacking knowledge I sent them a picture of the fuse I was working with just to see if they had a part or could make a part to fit since this wasn't the right fuse apparently there is a mini mini fuse now. They couldn't even forward the picture for me to the proper person to help me out. pathetic make sure you won't need customer support cause they lack it.
4,"Cheaper than local, but wish they would last longer.","Living in a very rural area, these replacements are very expensive at our local retailer. We're a little disappointed in how often we seem to change them. We run about 7 hours nightly on our lights and it's every few months it seems like when they give up the ghost. Not sure if that is normal or not, but now we always keep a stockpile!"
3,They work as expected.,We have not tried every bulb but so far so good. I'm prepared for some not to work but this is so far a good value.
5,solar light bulb replacements,i have a hard time finding these on line at home depot where i brought the lights glad i was able to get them from amazon now i know where i can get
4,Enjoyable Read,"I really enjoyed this book. It was very lively history, not at all dry. I thought the book was balanced in its view and not ""pro-British"" at all as some other readers have suggested. It made the soldiers' lives much more vivid than books that merely chart the major wars and minor disputes."
2,"A popular account, very Anglo-Centric and very disapponting","Having read Farwell's previous work ""Queen Victoria's Little Wars"", which I quite liked, I was expecting to like this book as well. Unfortunately, ""Armies of the Raj"" is an ill-researched throwback. It parrots tired old imperialist ""truisms"" about India, the ""martial"" races, and the Indianization of the Indian Army's officer Corps, and presents the British presence in India as the greatest thing since sliced bread. A much better book is David Omissi's ""THE SEPOY AND THE RAJ: THE INDIAN ARMY, 1860-1940"". Farwell writes well; if only his content had been as good as his style."
1,they did not work at all,"A waste of money and time. I took them out of the box put batteries , charged and one contol did not work, and the other hovercraft did not work, returning items is not a option for me as i live in the caribbean and get charge for sending and recieving items"
3,Great for younger people,"I bought this DVD to show to 9th graders with learning disabilities. The movie was easy to understand and since it was shown on TV, it did not have any inappropriate scenes. It doesn't perfectly follow the book, but was close enough. This allowed for a good compare/contrast lesson."
1,"overpriced, no adjustablility","It's difficult to see what this item offers that the 24 dollar items do not. If someone who likes and/or sells it could fill us in, I'd appreciate it."
5,"Crisp, clear, and incredibly helpful","This is the ultimate resource for a student of costume and fashion design, the key for readers of all levels to decode the jargon that fills this profession's books. The organization is impeccable, the language clear and concise, and the rare but sufficient pictures are crisply adept at illustrating the necessary word or concept.It covers everything from names of period pieces, accessories, and undergarments to modern terms in the fashion world. It has everything you'd need."
4,Book,Received in a timely manner. Nicely package. Book has torn corners as stated. Otherwise still in good condition.
5,An amazing life and man!,Absolutely amazing! I never knew there was an American in China who was that close to Mao and all his co-horts during that time period. I was so surprised that a foreigner was ever allowed to be on the inside track as much as Sideny Rittenberg was. My husband is Chinese and he couldn't believe it either. I loved reading an American's perspective on the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and comparing it to all the other accounts I have read. A fascinating journey through the formation of the communist party in China!
5,"Sad but encouraging, a MUST HAVE","Illuminating in terms of the information one is able to get from this book. Politics in the United States and China are the main element in this book, and of course, against the backdrop of a man who says he was never a US spy in China, but is captured and spends 16 years as a prisoner in solitary confinement in China.He gained his freedom, and the how or why, remains interesting to me. Great life story, happy ending."
4,The Man Who Stayed Behind,"This is a book written by a man who had experienced some incredible events, so you will learn a lot and have some insight understanding about the some history of a great country. You can also understand the certain conflicts between different cultures."
3,Life of Sidney Rittenberg - the man who stayed behind,"A fascinating bio of a remarkable man, Sidney Rittenberg, that found his destiny in Red China after WW II. His life story in China of Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution of 1966 gives a fascinating insight of China's politics and culture. Sidney is the first American to 'discover' modern China before the historical voyage of Henry Kissinger in the 70s to establish economic and trade links between the two super powers. A must read bio to anyone interested in modern China's affairs."
2,"Stay far, far away if you value your sanity","We bought the Polly Pocket Cruise Ship for our daughter's Christmas a year ago, when she was 3 1/2. Let me say this first...she was too young. This toy isn't durable whatsoever and so pieces are constantly falling off or falling apart. Since she can't fix them (she's 4 1/2 now) she's is always asking us to fix them. Or, if we don't, the toy doesn't get played with which is a shame for something that cost so much.I love all the Polly Pocket stuff we've gotten, so we thought the cruise ship would be great. But alas, no. After a year of fixing, reattaching, picking up parts, putting things together, etc etc etc, I'm finally putting it together one final time and taking it to goodwill. I pity the mom who buys it. Maybe if you have an 8-10 year old girl, who is capable of putting it back together herself, then it might be a better choice."
2,A Junky toy,The Polly Pocket Cruise ship toy is fun but when I first got it we built it and then the next day it broke. The slide fell off and the spa at the top fell off. I sure learned my lesson. I hope you make the right choice and not buy it. It`s just a way to take 80 dollars away. Make the right choice.
3,Not So Hip Cruise Ship,"This was the ONLY thing my daughter asked for again and again for Christmas...I was surprised to such a huge price difference between Amazon and Wal-Mart [...] which is probably the only reason we bought it for her. The Ship is kinda flimsy, the pieces don't stay in place, the slide doesn't fit quite right into the slots for it, and the pieces that hold the elevator in place snapped almost immediately. We did buy the accessory pack that comes separately, good thing or she wouldn't have had much to play with. It's interesting to watch a 6 year old play with 3 girls and only 1 boy, even with the accessory pack.Honestly I am not a fan of Polly Pockets to begin with, the pieces are easily lost (more so than Barbie or Bratz) and I don't like that the dreeses and shoes are made of rubber, they don't ever quite fit right. But it made my daughter very happy at Christmas, and the price was right. Thank you Amazon!"
4,My 4 y/o niece was verrrry excited about the PP Cruise Ship,The ship came in great shape and quickly. We are very happy with all of our purchases through Amazon.com!
5,Lots of Fun play,My daughter received this gift for Christmas when she was 5. She loves it. She has lots of fun setting it up and making sure everything is in its place. I love it because everything folds up and goes out of the way for easy storage.
5,Highly entertaining toy for a young girl...,"My aunt and uncle gave this to my 5 year old daughter last Christmas. She absolutely loves it! There are so many activities that are possible with this playset... the dolls can swim in the pool, climb the rock wall, go parasailing, shop, eat, etc. Tons of accessories to play with. I would recommend keeping this playset in an area of the bedroom where you can leave it ""set up"" at all times. There are some parts (like the railings and escalator) that fall off, but it isn't more than a minor nuisance. My daughter loves dressing and undressing the dolls... it keeps her occupied for hours. I know the price seems high, but I think well worth it."
4,Cute and hours of entertainment,"a little misrepresented on the outside of the box though.It is cute, but a little ackward in how the accessories fit together.My 6 year old loves it...just a note though, remind them to pick it up from the BOTTOM, because it will come apart if picked up from the stack on top of the ship. LOTS of little things to keep busy for hours.Needs more polly dolls though."
1,Over priced Junk,"This thing is flimsy...difficult to put together and keep together and not appropriate for anyone under the age of 8 even though the recommended ages are 4-8. The fence will not stay on, the hammock does not work at all If it was 25$ even 30$ I probably wouldn't complain, but fo 75$ I expected something a little better and more entertaining. My 6 year old daughter got this and the Theme park for Christmas and to be honest I found both to be the most disappointing toys of this Christmas, and the biggest rip off of the year."
5,WOW! Polly Cruise Ship entertains!,"My 8 year old and all her friends spend hours playing with this set. It is big enough for 2 to play with at once, has lots of accessories and folds up neatly for storage. The best of the Polly Pockets sets."
5,So Hip Polly,I bought this toy for my six year old daughter for Christmas. She has a lot of Polly's and enjoys playing with them. Some of the previous larger sets that I bought for her were hard to set up so I looked this one over carefully. It is easy to set up. Items stay hooked in or set up where they are supposed to. My daughter especially enjoys the pools. The accessories are cute and fun. It is a fun toy to share with a friend. I got this set for about $35. I had seen it listed for about $50 elsewhere. I felt I got a really good deal by buying through Amazon. I guess I lucked out on getting such a good price by buying at Christmas time.
3,"Love the look, but finish flakes off and bulbs burn out quickly","I love the way these look lining my flower beds and the light they give off. But after 2 years or so the finish is pealing on some of them. And the bulb life is not good, probably because the bottom is open to the elements. I have had Malibu cs140k lights (completely sealed bulbs) around my pool for 2 years and have yet to replace a single bulb."
1,"Watch out, not a complete product! Expensive return too.","I love the look of these, but when they arrived, there is no way to plug them in. The description doesn't say they are attached together by 3's, nor does it say you have to have some other part (what?? I couldn't get customer service to tell me) to plug them into a socket, since they are low voltage. In addition, you lose 33% of the cost, by the time you pay a 15% restocking fee and the shipping fee to you AS WELL AS the return postage. I would advise not to buy them. Another reviewer says the finish comes off."
1,Do not buy,"Not only is this soap painfully over priced but it is the worst shave soap I have come across. The smell is actually quite nice but it requires a great deal of effort to make a proper lather, and once made vanishes on your face within a minute or two. There are so many better cheaper shave soaps out there. Save your self the dissapointment and get something else."
2,picture is deceving,the picture made me think i was getting 6 sets of needles i thought it was a great deal but when i got the package it only had one set and the color was not of my choosing most companies put in your choice of colors but not this company and when i emailed the company i did not get a replySusan Bates Crystalites Yarn Needles
2,2004 National five digit zipcode and postal directory vol 2,"I was disappointed that it was only a volume 2 ---so only half of the US. I had not expected it to be such an exhaustive collection. No biggee, I just am being open to say I did not explore enough to know what I was ordering. The delivery was timely....and I take it as my error. Thanks for asking."
3,Jazz brushin',What a great set of brushes. They can handle the pressure as well as the wear outs. It sounds great on the cymbals and it provides delicious staccatos.
2,Not the best,"Its a pain when ever your electricity goes out and then comes back on you have to go out and unplug the fixture, wait a few minutes and then plug it in again to re activate fixture. Other then that its a standard light fixture."
2,Great while they worked...,"These floodlights were awesome, for almost a year, then they just stopped working. They have easy settings for sensitivity and how long they stay on, and they worked really well. They just broke way too fast. They didn't even make it to the one year mark. Wish I had kept the box :("
3,"Lesson learned, don't judge book by it's cover","I was hoping to learn a lot more about the Austrian method and it's interpretation of economics. Well, as the title states, this sounded like a good start but it's simply not a good primer for the subject. In fact, one of the lessons the author states several times is the lack of value in making predictions in economics. Well, making a prediction about what this book was actually about was a complete waste of resources. There are some nuggets of valuable information and it's a very short read but it's more of a philosophy book than an economic book. Just beware, it might not be exactly what you think it is and that was pearl of wisdom I attained."
4,Miles.,"This isn't the greatest Miles CD, but ""Round Midnight"" and ""A Night In Tunisia"" are good songs. Miles isn't at his best because of the drugs he had been taking, but he still does a good job. This CD also includes solos by Max Roach and Chet Baker."
2,Good story but full of typos,"Author and/or publishing company could use a proofreader, one who knows the difference between ""desert"" and ""dessert"" and ""draws"" and ""drawers,"" among other punctuation errors. Good story, but as a proofreader, I can't help but be distracted (and disappointed) by all the typos."
3,Think about investing in a real central A/C unit,"Overall, it is a great deal of money to spend on something that only cools an average sized bedroom for 4 hours tops. After that point, the heat generated by the unit overcomes the cool air it is generating and you can feel the room begin to heat up again. I would say if you have no other option as far as a window unit or a ductless central A/C system, which will set you back about $3,000, it is at least a small oasis in the summer heat for a few hours. In retrospect, I should have just sucked it up, worked an extra job for a month and paid to have central A/C installed. This is one time where the quality is more important then the price of the item."
2,"great well made watch, but very uncomfortable band","I really like the look and apparent quality of this watch. But...we got it for our 5 year old son, he was very excited about it, but hasn't worn it for more than 5 minutes at a time. He says it is uncomfortable, so I looked at it on him and the edges of the band cut into his skin when he moves his hand around. We tried wearing it looser, etc. but havn't gotten it to work for him."
1,wires,This wire set is priced way too high and can not be feasible to even consider as a wise choice to act upon. It must be shunned at all costs.
2,A real disappointment,"I found the information in this book confusing at best and demoralizing at worst. It contains advice for pregnant women to keep their BG below 120- almost double what is normal for non-diabetic women. There's some very troubling advice given to women who wish to get pregnant and have damaged kidneys (ie no mention of stabilizing BG first, reversing the damage) and the implication that it's OK to give in to cravings if you have PMS as giving in can release stress (so it's OK to give in a eat a bag of cookies....??). If you're a diabetic woman, I would recommend other books to reverse the complications of diabetes before you get pregnant, and generally to understand the disease better, without wasting time on this one. The Diabetes Solution by Dr Bernstein is a much more effective, much more specific and helpful book with a plan of action that works, even if it does require some effort."
5,Better than Boktai,"First there was Boktai, then Boktai 2. Both of these games were not so popular among gamers, mainly because of its difficult availability, and for the people who owned it, it was a large hassle to play, mainly because of the solar sensor. Imagine you are a child receiving this game on Christmas morning, and start playing immediately. But, alas! You cannot make it past the first dungeon without sunlight! So you have to wait until summer to play it. With Lunar Knights, you can control two characters, Aaron and Lucian, as well as an in-game weather system. Yes the solar sensor has been trashed! This is a great game for any gamer, with great puzzles and a well thought out story, if not a little short. A great addition to any gamers collection."
3,Bought this a long time ago...,"Don't compare it to Boktai 1. The first was a masterpiece (though flawed). This game is definitely more user friendly and geared towards a perhaps a more 'younger' audience (seems more cartoonish than the first). It has its upside, but die-hard lovers of the first game (who embraced the challenges) will find that certain spark absent from this installment. Buy it if its cheap and your bored for an okay title."
3,Repetitive and mediocre,"I bought this game after reading several positive reviews and a high ranking across the board on different video game sites. Which makes me scratch my head and ask, am I missing something? The RPG aspect of the game is not at all deep, and the mechanics are clunky. The action is repetitive and can largely be avoided to get through a map--which make dungeons quite boring. The best part of the game is the full-motion video clips that open the game and occur after defeating a boss--and even that becomes repetitive. The gameplay that requires the DS' touch screen and mic are clearly tacked on, and this could have easily been a GBA cart, even with the anime clips. It makes me long for the original Golden Sun on GBA, which would much better benefit from the DS' dual screen."
2,Compact binocular 8X24,I was disappointed with these bought them as a Christmas present.Not as sharp as I hoped. I have a cheap pair of Bushnell 7X35 WA that are much sharper. I would not recommend these
1,Maybe my moths are picky.,"I read pretty much every review on different kinds of moth traps. Most every brand had been reviewed glowingly by some and as disappointing by others. So, I purchased this one about a month ago. The moth problem in our house seemed to be under control, but we'd seen that before and then been greeted by polenta with moths (not my kind of recipe).The few moths that were left ignored the trap. Now I'm seeing a few more. Uh, oh. They too are ignoring the traps. I've seen them fly right by them! I guess different moths like different pheromones. Seriously though, I wish manufacturers would give more information as to why a product will work for some moth problems and not for others.Moths in the house. Check. Moths in the traps. None.Time to look for another kind."
1,Moths Mate around the Trap,The title says it all. Moths were joined all around the trap -- literally -- yet the trap remained empty. Pheromone baited?
2,Not very effective so far,"I ordered a number of these because they were well-rated and less costly than the ones I had been using. So far, however, the moths seem very disinterested. I found the Xlure RTU traps more effective in my home."
5,This simply works,"I bought these since I had those pesky pantry moths that I couldn't get rid of no matter how much I cleaned and put into the refrigerator. Putting these in the kitchen, 1 in the pantry, 1 over the sink window and 1 over the refrigerator and they were gone within a few days. The bait does work as I noticed when assembling the 2nd trap. I had moths flying right into my hands where I was handling the bait! After the winter I had to stock up on more since they still seem to come back. Hopefully I won't need these forever, but they work great."
3,it works...i think.,"I got rid of the source of the larvae, but over the past month it seems to have trapped some moths. I didn't have a huge infestation so its effectiveness is hard to gauge, but there are still some months that are flying around, and a few came to my room.I hope it keeps on catching moths, b/c I don't think it has, recently."
5,They work!,"These traps are pretty inexpensive and work as advertised. We use them to control the occasional outbreaks of moths we get from our bird's food.It is important to remember that, while you should see moths stuck in the trap pretty quickly, it will take a while (a couple weeks) before the population really dies out, because only males are attracted to it, and you probably also will have eggs to hatch. I usually buy at least two packs of these at a time and always have a trap out."
5,Great!,"We have a parrot, and there always seems to be moths attracted to his food. I set one of these traps up near his cage (but not where he can bite it), and one in the next room, and it keeps moths away for three months."
2,Poor Packaging,"These probably will work, but unless you plan on putting out both traps at the same time, pick another brand as the pheromone cubes are in one package. Once you open that, they will degrade. Other brands I have bought, put each cube in a separate package so you can use them as needed. I won't buy this brand again!"
3,"Works OK, better products available","It does work and capture moths but in the past I have bought ones from another vendor that worked better, but were also more expensive. It did the job but took about a month to get all the moths."
5,Best punk album this year,"This album is a revelation for at least one reason: We now know that a ""punk"" band can record a complex, widely appealing, and varied hard rock album without going wimpy on us. Gets better with every listen.Totally blows the Criminals, Queers, Green Day, etc. out of the water."
5,An inspirational guide to living with ovarian cancer.,"Once my mother was diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer, I began to learn about this terrible disease.Of all the books and internet sites I found, this little paperback is among the best. Brief, authoritative and written by a long-term suvivor. It gives you the good, the bad and ugly about treatment options and the disease with an upbeat undercurrent that science and medicine is becoming more successful in treating ovarian cancer.The author wrote this book from the victims perspective, which makes it a great introductory tome for anyone just diagnosed with this vicious disease."
5,Best luxury watch you can buy for the money.,Beautiful when I got it. I have had it for 2 years and still think it is a beautiful watch. Still thinking of getting a second OMEGA watch...
5,Classic Reference Bible NASB,I was very pleased with this Bible. I gave it to my daughter-in-law and she was very satisfied with it.
3,Wonderful,I found this translation of the holy Word to be both stirringly beautiful in its language and accurate in its translation. Highly recommended for people who want to know what the original writers were really writing.
5,Some of the best sleep I ever had!,"I have a bad case of ""The Princess and the Pea"" syndrome. Not with this baby. I recently slept 10 hours on this air mattress and woke up feeling great with no aches to be had anywhere on my body. I mistakenly tried the raised aerobed after getting this thinking it would be superior. Bad move. The baffles were vertical on the aerobed as opposed to horizontal like the Beautyrest. This feature made a huge difference in comfort, even to my boyfriend who could sleep on a jagged rock. It is very stable, unlike the raised Aerobed which nearly popped me off every time I would turn. I love it and am very happy to have made the investment."
2,this sucks,"Ive went through two bed in the past 2 months. It leaks without me doing anything to it. I havent done anything that would make it leak, only sleep on it at night. If anyone planning on long-term bed, i would not recommend this."
1,Air Leak Shortly after Using,I thought buying the recognized brand name...means quality. It doesn't on this air mattress. I have return defective units a few times. They all starting leaking air. I have had air matteresses for years.Never experienced them leaking within the first month of owning it.Most lasted 3 years of better. Buyer beware when buying this one.Made in USA? No way..guess where?
4,Better than Aerobeds,"After four Aerobeds (of various sizes), I am finding this inflatable mattress to be much sturdier. All the Aerobeds developed leaks right on the seams (where it's hard to patch and may be more indicative of workmanship issues). My only complaint would be that the in/de-flator is a separate unit that has to be attached and packed separately for travel."
2,"Same product, same problems","Like others commenting here, I purchased the Simmons Extraordinaire because I live in an apartment and did not want to buy a bed that would be difficult to move when I go to a new place.I used this bed for about eight months, and had a plethora of problems. The edge of the stamping on the pillowtop began to separate and create tiny holes. As a result, oftentimes I'd wake up on the hard floor because the mattress lost its air and flattened.The valve went bad in a short period of time, and the mattress required me to refill it after sleeping on it a couple of times.And like another commenter, the interior membrane busted, leaving a huge bump in the middle of the pillowtop. I tried to deflate it to lessen the bump and flipped the mattress over, but my back felt as if it'd be run over by a car.I strongly recommend avoiding this product. Unfortunately, it won't last long. If you're looking for an air bed, spend a little bit more money on a higher-rated brand that will hold up."
3,Easy to set up and comfortable to sleep on.,I used the bed only for three night so far and got three good night of sleep. Was super easy and quick to set up and to put back in its bag.
3,disappointed,"I purchased the simmons air mattress wit the asumption that a mattress company would produce a quality air mattress, and because the cost was more than your average queen size air mattress, I thought I was paying for a higher quality WRONG. Its just ok. Not as deep as I had hoped and still has difficulty in holding air."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"I read all the -ve reviews of this book and still decided to give it a shot. I bought the book and tried real hard to read the first 4 chapters. It is so confusing that after a little while I just couldn't study anymore. The so called ""Skimming"" technique made my head spin, as I could not get a handle of what the book is trying to teach. In the end I returned this book and got ""The offical TOEFL guide"" (ETS). I think that's all you need to pass the test. The layout is simple, divided into 4 categories: Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking. (exactly how the iBT is presented) I think the official guide is worth every penny, so get it instead."
1,Really messy book,"I am a person who is preparing for TOEFL after all the books i have revised, i just went through this book and finally thought i will not be capable to get a good score in TOEFL.This book cannot be read by anyone.After reading a few pages i thought i will not write my TOEFL exam., may be after reading some of reviews about this book, i belived that this is really a mess.Hey folks if you really really want to succeed in TOEFL my suggestion is that DONT READ THIS BOOKKK..,.,"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book with high hopes, but it does not have good exercises for building skills for the TOEFL IBT. There are practice tests on the CD, but the book does not offer helpful support. I would recommend the Longman TOEFL IBT preparation book by Phillips instead."
4,It is an excellent product,It is an excellent guide to prepare for academic lectures and mesuare your ability to understand them.
4,perfect,"I begin to read it. It seems to be useful so much. There are a lot of readings, writing, listening and speaking exercises in it. If I study very hard with this book and CD I can be successful in English.Thank you for shipping it on certain date."
1,DO NOT BUY IT simply messy,"i was trying to find out what they are trying to say ,i did not get it !!! i thought there might be somthing wrong with me !!look at what the other peoples wrote and you will know.i think who give this book 5 starts are trying to sell it !!!!!!!!!!"
2,toefl,"bought all kaplan line for GRE and TOEFL , they R VERY SUPERFICIAL .THEY r good for a very basic issues , to introduce subject but not study it in detailed"
5,Seller should highlight the brand name!,Excellent battery. Fits very nicely in both the camera and charger. Easy on the budget too. Recommendation to the seller(s) of this battery -- mention clearly that the brand name is DURACELL and not some off-brand. I was suprised to open the package and find a much better battery inside than I thought I was getting.I like everything about this item.
2,Boring,I have to agree with the other reviewer. This book was so boring. Nothing exciting happened. No drama...nothing! The characters seemed to exist in their own world and were definitely not in touch with the year 2001. Please skip this one.
2,Ther perfect wedding or the perfect man?,"This is not the most exciting book. It did however; keep me interested to complete it. You have to keep up because it does bounce back and forth to the present and past. In the end it's a sweet story. Does Missy give in and marry a man she knows she does not love, or will she smarten up and allow Jimmy to enter her life again. If you manage to make it past the slow parts of the book, you will be in for a pleasant surprise. It's because of how the book ended, it's staying in my collection."
1,Hated it.,I can't rememeber the last time I had to put a book down before I finished it. I couldn't get pass the sixth chapter. I got sick and tired of reading and right in the middle of the sentence they go back in time. I could keep up with what's going on now from what happend in the past. Very boring book
4,Makes the System work,Easy to install but Ford Explorer has two connectors and I am always wondering what the other connector did that it is not now doing. Otherwise it is a five star item.
1,WILL NOT FIT 04+ F150,well i bought this for my 04 f150 yaa didnt fit so just so u guys know. dont make the same mistake i did.
5,Great cable!,I soldered it to my radio power/speaker harness and it worked great! Definitely a great buy for Ford F-150 owners or any other Ford Mazda that it fits!
5,"Can't beat the price, worked perfectly",Great price for a metra harness... nothing but plug and plastic bag in the package... but it had the pinout printed on the bag. Feels well made with good wiring. Matched up well to clarion stereo and solid connection with vehicle mount. No complaints
5,2001 Ford Ranger XLT,Worked perfectly to replace the stock stereo in my 2001 Ford Ranger XLT. Wire colors matched the Clarion CX501 stereo perfectly. MUCH cheaper than going through a place like Best Buy ($20).
5,Very nice,great item at the price. Beats paying that high price in the stores. My mother is happy. Dont have much to say but I gotta type more lol
4,Perfect fit for 2003 Ford F-150,"I picked this harness up for an installation on a 2003 Ford F-150. It was easy to install but the instructions do have the ""dimmer"" wire labeled as Orange/White when it was Orange/Black on this harness. Most people will not use that wire anyway; the orange wire in the harness labeled ""illumination"" is the one most people will use. For most aftermarket stereos it's just a matter of matching the wires on this harness to the same color wires on your stereo's harness. It can't get much easier than that...The Good:Easy to installGood qualityPriceThe Bad:One mislabeled wire in the instructions"
5,Perfect Fit,"This product was a perfect fit for my installation. Directions were clear and easy. The wires are a little thin relative to the wires from the AVH-3400 radio harness. Works great.P.S. This product was $4 on Amazon. It cost $20 at Best Buy. Save the money, it's the exact same harness."
3,it worked,"it did work. it was hard to get the factory to go into harness. i had to straight pins several times b/c just trying to connect them, it would bend a pin or two. but once got it connected, it worked as advertised."
3,"I'm sure it works great, but","it does NOT fit in a 2002 Protege5, which last time I checked, is a Mazda made after 1998. Please be sure to double check that this is the wiring harness for you!"
3,Depressing,"It's so difficult to review a book like this, by such a good writer. The writing is superb but the subject is so depressing. Emma Roberts, 27 years old and studying to finish a thesis which will eventually be published, leaves her mother's flat for a 6 month visit to Paris, to study 17th century garden design. It's not a subject with which she is totally enraptured, but for lack of anything better, she ploughs ahead with it. This very slim volume is taken up with her interior dialogue as, wallowing in loneliness and introspection, she makes a couple of doubtful friends who use her completely...and she allows them to do so. If I allowed myself to become totally immersed in this book, I'd be so depressed by her feelings of the pointlessness of life, that I's never recover. Now on to something a lot livelier to cheer myself up!"
4,Worked Perfectly (After replacing transformer),"My home was built in 1992, and I wanted to update the wired door bell chime. I liked how this chime looked so basic, and it doesn't really stand out. Unfortunetly, I ended up having to replace my current transformer to support this new chime. It was easy to do, but it was an unexpected cost not related to this product. My original transformer only supported an output of 10-Volt Amp, and this chime needed an output of 15/16-Volt Amp. In addition, the front door and back door both have a 2-note chime. Still, it's highly likely that it was a wiring mistake on my part."
4,"Plain, simple door chime",It works well and easy to install. I agree with another reviewer that the cover is too plain. I just put my old door chime cover on instead.
2,Adesso Cyberpad not compatible with Windows 8,"The Adesso Cyberpad is great if you are still using Windows XP. I have been trying to get it to work with Windows 8. I downloaded the updated software from Adesso. The laptop sees the Cyberpad, but will not open the programs to use the Cyberpad. If you can get it to work with Windows 8 - send in a review. Please."
1,Major Returns Hassle,"Bought through Amazon from Factory Depot. I compared the Cyberpad against the Livescribe pen and decided that for me, the Livescribe is a better match. So, I requested a return for the Cyberpad on the Amazon site. Factory Depot has been absolutely awful regarding this return. First I had to respond to an email verifying the return. A few days later had to respond to another email describing why I am returning. Then, almost a month later I finally received an email with an RMA number and stating that I should expect another two weeks for the credit AFTER Factory Depot receives the returned product. STAY AWAY FROM THIS VENDOR!"
4,"Nice Package, USB Won't Connect","The Cyberpad arrived yesterday. The product design looks solid, interface simple and well placed. As other reviews mentioned, my Cyberpad also won't connect to a computer through USB. You can see power is supplied to the pad via the USB cable, with the LED light flashing and the LCD showing the right symbols. On the computer side, there was no recognition of a new device connected. Tried on another computer, the result is the same.It's a good product. I am not sure if I will ship it back for a replacement unit."
4,My only issue is the pen,Love the pad -- the only problem is trying to find refills for the pen -- these are not cheap or easy to find.
4,CyberPad and OneNote - good combo,"I am pretty happy with my cyberpad. Compared to the other digitizer options it is a pretty easy choice. It uses standard 8.5x11 sized pads, has a reasonable sized pen, and doesn't take special paper. I was unhappy with evernote (even evernote plus) and found some third party software called CyberConverter from Blue Euclid Software that imports the .top files into Microsoft OneNote. I agree with previous posters that OneNote is much more powerful. anyway, the CyberConverter fixed my only real complaint."
5,Great for Getting Organized,"I've been using the CyberPad for about a month now, and like it so well that I decided to rate it five stars. What makes it great for getting organized is its integration with EverNote, the note organizing software that comes bundled with the CyberPad. I have setup each of my work projects in EverNote. Whenever I go to meetings I take notes on the CyberPad and then put everything in EverNote at the end of the day. I also save notes form my Microsoft Office software and the Internet in EverNote. Now whenever I want the information on a particular project just click on its category in EverNote and all my related notes pop up. My supervisor liked the CyberPad/EverNote combination so much that she bought 10 of them so that everyone in our work group could have one."
2,Poor quality and usage model is questionable,"I bought this Cyberpad originally to use it as a notebook for work. Well, the product came in defective - usb interface didn't work. (I ended up returning it to Amazon for refund.) And then I found the usage model very questionable. 1) have to keep track of the page numbers so the physical pages and the electronic pages are in sync - not intuitive, especially if you need to tear off/retire the pages. 2) the pad is very bulky - didn't feel like carrying it around. I imaging this system is probably good for survey people or jobshop people who needs to fill out the forms but I don't see it being used as an electronic notebook."
3,Util pero con algunas observaciones,"El producto en general es interesante, pero tiene algunas desventajas en mi humilde opinión- A menos que se tenga una muy prolija y excelente letra, la migración de los textos a Word es deficiente- Es dificil de conseguir repuestos de los grafos localmente- El lápiz resulta un tanto grueso, espero en futuras evoluciones, puedan reducir el tamaño del mismoEn general, aceptable y útil."
4,Pleased so far with the Cyberpad,"I just got the Cyberpad last week and I have used it for a few days. The product is just as I expected, thin and lightweight. The software was easy to install although I agree with an earlier reviewer that they could have done a better job with the documentation (in fact they need to correct major typos in the ""manual"" such as change from ""lunch"" to ""launch""!). The pen is indeed a bit bigger than what I'd like and I hope they will come up with a thinner replacement. The notes are captured very well eventhough my handwriting is not very good (specially in fast paced meetings). For me one of the biggest benefits is the Evernotes software package which comes with Cyberpad. With Evernotes, I can catalog and organize all the notes taken and assign tags for specific categories which makes it a breeze to find my notes later on (which was a problem I was trying to solve with the Cyberpad). So, I would rank it a 5-star except for the pen size."
2,Gave it away,Thought this would be a nice tool for note taking but found it to be more of a pain then worth it.I gave it to my daughter so she could draw with it.Would not purchase another.DVG
3,"Good notepad, poor software","I think that the notepad does a good job and it comes with a full package: battery, cover, extra ink cartridges etc... The electronic notes are very accurate and give a real copy of what has been written.But the software package is really poor...In order to save the notes as pdf files, you must first use ritemail to convert them in picture format (BMP) then, in a second step, buy a software to convert BMP into PDF....Pricy and cumbersome. Also, the files format (.top) is not compatible with Microsoft One Note wich is for me the best software to take electronic notes."
3,Plastic,"The notepad is good, but it feels plastic. I like it because I can organize my notes with it. I use it with a Sandisk 1 GB ultradisk II card. It is much easier for me to transfer the files with the card than to carry around yet another cable.Problems:1. Evernote is not compatible with Vista, not a big problem, but anyway.2. Sometimes the notepad just shuts itself off. Probably because a loose connection with the SD card, I think. But it is annoying. Make that this is not happening to you when you use it by looking at the display once in a while when writing on the pad.3. It is a bit heavy and bulky.All in all, I use it, it works ok. Dispensable for me."
1,Poor Handwriting Recognition,The product OCR capabilities are very poor. If you intend to use the OCR feature only then do not buy the product. Very useful for drawings.
2,Cyberpad-Reasonable Value for Price,"The Cyberpad is a reasonable value for the price.Quality of the device is a little bit on the low side, but it is functional for most advertised purposes. It is ideal for taking notes, without the noise of a notebook keyboard - and without the risk of losing a tablet PC.Two negatives -The pen is terrible to use. The diameter is on the large side and the material it is made of does not provide for a comfortable grip.An advertised feature of the tablet is it's ability to expand the limited internal memory through the use of an SD card (not supplied). Despite trying two different cards from SanDisk (the recommended supplier) and contacting the support number, no such luck. One card would not allow the tablet to turn on at all. The other card seemed to work fine, but after anything from 15 to 40 minutes, the tablet would shut-down and fail to save your work."
3,"OK, meals, but arrive partly thawed","The meat-lovers meals are OK--nutritious, good veggies, low sodium, healthy, but not as tasty as other choices. I had thought ""meat"" might include chicken, turkey, or other choices, but it means mostly ground meat assembled into different shapes. These meals are a good idea, though, but have the serious drawback that they do NOT arrive fully frozen, dry ice is GONE, and partly thawed meals seem iffy to me. ConAgra, please add more dry ice to your generally decent, unique product."
1,somewhat pleased,i wasn't happy with the size . sleeves were too short. and the material was rough in the blouse. some of us girls have long arms but our torsos are slim. . buying blouses by mail is always a gamble. for me anyway.
1,"It's Really Simple, Overly Sweet, and WAY Overpriced","This ""book"" consists of a series of nine short essays. The essays are sweet and poignant. However, there's nothing more than you would expect to find in a good local Little League newsletter. If this ""book"" sold for $2.50 and the proceeds went to a local league, I'd buy it in a second. Be forewarned; it's not worth $7.95!!"
3,"Great information, rough read.","Lee presents great information, however, sifting and assimilating it into a cohesive program takes some doing. If you know your stuff it's worth the struggle."
4,A good book about an interesting front,"This is a very good book about a little known naval front in WWI. This book covers the channel struggle during WWI. The author is well informed and has a captivating style. The text is somewhat biased towards the british side and I also missed some more technical data about the ships involved, but I enjoyed it very much anyway. I do recommend it to any body interested in WWI naval history."
4,Red Recovery,"Like it. Glad I got a copy of this out of print CD. Cafe Jolie is a song I remembered in fragments and searched out. Good CD, worth the money. I should have bought it when it came out."
5,SUPERB,"This is possibly the most worthwhile item I have ever purchased through amazon.com! If you like anything similar to this, you'll certainly love it! Before you buy, however, be sure to check out related merchandise as this piece can be quite a shock to newcomers. It's well worth the cost though!"
1,wired door bell,"the good thing is that it is wired, not wireless.the bad thing is that it is not loud enough.just about any noise will overpower it and make in ineffective: the tv, the dish washer, my sewing machine.Since I installed this bell to hear customers ring the bell when I am sewing, I would have to say that this bell is ineffective. I am very dissappointed."
5,Heartbreakingly Beautiful,"What everyone else has said here, I wholeheartedly endorse. This is a hauntingly beautiful album, and every real jazz fan knows this. Pepper bares his soul and breaks your heart, and everyone involved--pianist Tommy Flanagan, bassist Red Mitchell, drummer Billy Higgins--seems to have recognized that this session was something special: None of these great musicians has ever sounded better or more committed than they do here. This is Art's cri de coeur, his tragic lament for a wasted life, his proud determination to make amends. He reaches deep and gives us the most moving performances ever. Thank you, Art, and may your troubled soul rest in peace."
2,Incomplete,"The life of James II is extremely intriguing: flight from England early in life, prowess as a miltary commander, conversion to Catholism, and eventual ouster in favor of William III and James' protestant daughters. Sadly, this biography does not cover in detail any of these fascinating events. Rather, Miller's focus is solely on the relationships between James, his brother, his chief advisors, Parliament, and Louis XIV. A reader unfamiliar with the political climate of the later 17th century will have difficulty enjoying this book.In my opinion, the political intrigues (clearly important in understanding James II) could have been interwoven with a personal study of James to produce a more compelling, and well rounded, biography of a largely unknown monarch."
4,Quality!,"If you have heard any of Ann Beretta's other stuff, or their first album, then there is no doubt that you will fully appreciate this record. It's on that level of just below perfect, some of the songs a bit softer, but most are on the punk level I'm sure you've grown to expect from this group. And its finished up with a sex pistols cover. hmm... interesting....."
3,3 suggestions for improving this book,"It's got a lot of songs in there, but I'd like to suggest 3 improvements:1) Drawings of the physical activities like ""head, shoulders, knees and toes,"" which can be easily followed when working with kids. The book is nearly all just TEXT with very little illustration. Hard to use as a reference when you're actually DOING these activities.2) Include a CD so we can hear the tunes.3) A spiral binding would allow us to keep it open on the floor when we're with the toddlers."
3,Leaky!,"These are great for replacing the canning lid once you open a jar, but be careful with liquids because they leak!"
2,the lids don't seal all the way,"i like to put liquids in my mason jars, but these lids dont seal all the way, so you cant turn your jar horizontally or theyll leak"
4,Not Perfect but Functional,The lids fit well but they are not air tight as I would have expected. If the jar is placed on its side the contents will leak out.
5,Perfect for after the seal is broken,"After you break the seal of a canning jar, it needs to be refrigerated if you aren't using the entire contents. You can always use the tin lids, but they corrode and erode quickly. These plastic caps are the perfect solution. They seal nicely, and the hassle of a two piece lid is a non-issue. If you can a lot of food, these are a must have."
3,lids leak,I bought them to add powder vitamin mix to water but when i shake them up they leak under the lid and run down the side :(
3,"Good Product, but better by the dozen","Excellent product and price, but I kind of wished they came in dozens, since that's how I buy my jars."
4,Makes using canning jars easy!,"I've taken to using half gallon and quart jars for making juice, kefir and iced tea. These plastic lids make using them so much easier! I love them. They're available in wide and standard mouth sizes so check to make sure you order the right size for your jars."
5,Perfect and useful,This is just what I needed use for using my collection of wide mouth ball jars for storage. Much easier that the two piece lids and longer lasting [cleaner] than the metal.
5,Love them!,"Perfect canning jar lids, wish I knew about them before! Very happy they are BPA free too, as I keep homemade baby food in the fridge with them."
5,great for an avid juicer,I got these to put on top of the mason jars I use to carry my home made juice to work. Its so nice to not have to mess with the ring and disc set when I want to have a drink. I am happy!
4,Works well but stains sometimes,"I got these to replace the metal bands and lids I was using because they would rust after a while. I put matcha tea in a mason jar with filtered water as my main drink. These plastic lids work well for that as long as you twist them tight before shaking so they don't leak. But when I juiced some veges and used this lid, it was stained a brownish tint. I do still prefer these to the metal lids, but it would be nice if they wouldn't stain."
4,Great for storing food & easy to label,"We use these lids every day on our mason jars. They are nice because they don't rust (obviously) like the metal ones do if you try to reuse them.My husband used to try to take jars with these lids to work as part of his lunches, but these lids usually leak, so now he uses other glass containers with different lids.For not taking things places, these work great. We typically use them on mason jars of milk, which we get from our dairy goats. We use wet-erase markers (the same kind that are used for overhead projectors) on these lids to write information about the contents (eg, we write when we collected the milk). Then, when you wash the lids, the information rinses right off. If you freeze the jar, when it defrosts the wet-erase portion usually gets blurry, but for fridge stuff it stays great."
1,lids do not keep liquid inside jar.,"These lids on Ball jars do not seal liquids. All of the lids leaked so you have to store upright or you have a mess. I would not purchase these again. One star if you want to store sugar, rice, bulk solids they are fine."
2,Grrrrrrrr,"Some say these lids leak. I can't even get them to sit well on the jar. They pop off just as you are getting the screwing underway. Very disappointed. You would think they would be universal, Kerr, Ball, Mason, but something is wrong."
4,Great Product,"Great product, Fast Shipping, Although the lids crack real easy, so you have to be careful if you plan on drilling into them. Other than that they are great, except that they don't have any gaskets so they are not water proof but you can purchase the gaskets separately and make them water proof. Over all a great product and great seller. Will do business again."
5,Lids that won't rust!,"These lids arrived promptly and in excellent condition.I'm so happy to find lids for canning jars that don't rust like the rings and lids that have been available for so many years. I am not canning now but do need reliable lids for the jars in which I save things--left-overs, dry ingredients, etc.."
5,Perfect,"Great for taking my home-made smoothies on the train in the mornings. The local hardware store only stocked the regular-sized lids, so I'm glad I could find the wide-mouthed lids here."
4,"They leak, however...",These are fine if you store items upright but they will leak liquid if tipped or sloshed. I have found a solution for that though.If you buy the replacement rubber rings for the tattler canning lids they fit perfectly inside these lids and will prevent leaks.Or you could just use the tattler lids but then you have to use a metal ring and these plastic ones look nicer.
4,Put a lid on it!,"These little plastic lids are handy! Word of advice: make sure you select the correct size of lids you want ie wide mouth or standard. I don't do a lot of canning but like to use 1/2 pint wide mouths for some refrigerator items ie sauces, dressings or oatmeal. Easy to clean and easy to use. These lids are super cheap and make life simpler."
3,"Good, not great","If you are going to use your jars to store dry stuff, I highly recommend these lids. However, for liquids, they do leak. I used them to carry some Oriental style dipping sauce to work, and it made a huge mess in my bag. Not a great experience at all."
5,Wide mouth plastic caps,Recieved the order in a timely fashion. The caps were exactly what I wanted and I am very pleased with them. I will be ordering more.Thanks Ed
3,leaks,"I primarily used these on jars storing dry ingredients and thought they were great. I just tried it on a jar with wet ingredients last night and noticed severe leaking. The lid is a bit too flexible and didn't seal right. I am making a vanilla infusion where I have to shake the mixture every week until it is done. First time I shook it, I got liquid all over the outside of the jar. I ended up using the lid with some saran wrap to seal but I'm sure it's not a wonderful seal. The point of my review is that obviously these jar lids do not seal well."
2,They will work but careful of fit.,"I have had a lot of problems with plastic mason jars. I do not think there is a given standard to size or shape, and it doesn't help that descriptions for these products do not include a metric or imperial indication for size.The lids ended up being just too large to fit around my jars...but I was able to use electrical tape to tighten the seal and they will meet our needs."
2,Not what I wanted,This is not what I wanted. I was hoping for the wide mouth bigger mason jar lids. These are made for the small mason jars. The package I received was closed but the box inside was opened and unreturnable according to the return policy.
2,Not leakproof,"These are not leakproof or water tight, no matter how tightly I screw them on. An inferior product. I wanted to use them to store liquidy food that needs to be shaken but these won't work."
2,They leak,"These lids leak! I really wanted something with an tight seal that would not allow the product to leak out, but it leaks, and not just a little bit. They are ok for keeping some salsa in the fridge for a few days, but they dont keep food fresh long, and you better hope your jars dont tip over! I really dont understand why they made a product that leaks like this."
5,don't look back,"i usually don't like to advocate plastic where recyclable materials will do, but in this case, i think that's wrong. i really needed these for my fermented products - like sourdough and preserved lemons - where the product sort of eats into the metal rings. i highly recommend these. I'm probably not looking back - it's all plastic lids from now on.."
4,Not widely available in stores,"I purchased these online because I haven't been able to find the wide mouth version in my local stores. I have used the regular mouth version for a couple of years. My only criticism is that they can leak unless you place the canner lid inside as a seal. Otherwise, they do the job I needed them for which is capping open jars of veggies or jellies for refrigeration."
2,Leaks without seals,"If you do not buy the rubber seals, do not tip a filled jar over or it will leak. Rubber seals are more effort than I would like... going back to the rusty metal ones."
2,poor quality,Have used this product for 30 years and very surprised at the poor quality of this box of caps. Caps are much thinner then usual.
1,Leaky and almost useless,"We use mason jars for just about everything, from canning to storage to drinking glasses. I got a set of the plastic lids for shaking up protein mixes, and no matter how tightly I screw them on they just leak all over the place - on the floor, on my shirt, in my gym bag, etc. These might be good for dry goods that don't need an air-tight seal, but otherwise you're better off with old, nearly worn out metal lids."
5,Worth the wait!,"These lids are a perfect fit on the mason jars - a great alternative to the metal lids. I just kept the box they came in and am using it to store them, works great."
2,not tight enough,"didnt fit onto my jars securely enough, they were leaking.I guess I will have to find another way to store my fresh juice."
1,Not Water Tight,"These lids are not water tight, and consequently useless. I am the guy you go to when you need someone to open a tight jar. The problem is not that I am not tightening enough."
4,Good but spendy,"Great replacement on wide-mouth jars - don't like the ring & cap combo - too fussy. But I don't know if these are liquid spill-proof, as one reviewer had problems. I'm using for dry storage & refrigerator left-overs. I do think this item is over-priced though. These are just plastic caps, nothing terribly special or unusual about them. I guess it's just a niche item, so they can charge what they want for us folks who are trying to re-use/reduce, etc."
5,Ball Plastic Jar Caps,Love these plastic jar caps. Already had this wide size but wanted a few more. Also ordered the regular size at that time. Can't say enough good things about these little covers.
4,Good product,"Good product, good service. It's my own fault I ordered the wrong size! But I ordered another set (wide-mouth) and now have both sizes."
5,Very good service.,Very good service and quick shipping. Item description needs to include regular or wide-mouth size.
5,Love these screw-on caps,The title says it all. I love being able to put away the metal rings and lids. These plastic lids seem to seal well while storing canned goods in the fridge.
2,They leak.,"Sadly, they leak. They look good, appear to fit nicely, but put a liquid in there and they'll leak, which means air can get in and spoil your dry goods, too. Considering that they cost more than five dollars for a minimal amount of cheap plastic, they should be better than this.Disappointing."
1,Leaking,"I am infusing oils with herbs and have spent quite a bit on them. Turns our the lids are leaking every time I shake the jars. It's a shame, but perhaps I should not have expected plastic lids to hold oils."
1,These leak!!!,These do leak - don't be fooled like I was! I figured since there were mixed reviews that it had to be operator error. So I ordered the Tattler reusable canning lids and rubber rings (BPA free) and they work like a charm in conjunction with the plastic storage caps. I was hoping to keep it simple and just use the plastic storage caps but no such luck. I take 2 green smoothies to work in glass mason jars every day and I cannot have them leaking all over! The combination of products helped me to accomplish getting rid of those rusty metal lids which I am thrilled about. This is the best BPA free/metal free solution I have found thus far.P.S. I bought the Tattler reusable canning lids and rubber rings on Ebay --- much much cheaper than Aamazon!
2,Ball Wide Mouth Plastic Storage Caps,I thought I was going to love my caps and I guess I do as long as I'm not shaking liquid in my jars because the liquid comes out from underneath and makes a mess. What's going on with the caps?
5,Love these!,"I'm a mom who prefers making and freezing food for her baby. I use the Ball 4 oz regular mouth glass jam jars for thawed/cooked food storage and needed lids that didn't rust. I found these and love them! They're sturdy, fit perfectly, easy to clean. I haven't tried them in the freezer, but have no reason so suspect they won't work."
1,Tops,"This picture is misleading,I thought I was buying jars,but I only got the tops. What can I say. No wonder it was so inexpensive hahahaa"
5,Plastic Ball Jar Lids,I don't like plastic but I detest rusty lids even more. I now have a simple lid to put my on my soup.
5,Lids Work Great,The lids were exactly what i needed for my project. They were shipped in a timely manner and arrived in perfect condition. Thanks.
1,what good are they if they leak?,These leak so I won't use them for much. I really expected something made my Ball to be better than this.
2,Broken,My lids came in the nail and 2 of them were broken. The plastic was not molded properly to screw on as a lid so I had throw them away.
4,Beautiful!,It's just as pretty in person as it is in the pictures. It was a gift for a close friend who had lost theirs. When they opened it they were quite excited. The only issue they told me they had was tuning it. They stated it was hard to tune without breaking the strings because it was so new. I don't know if that is an issue with the product or the new owner. I just know that it seemed like a great purchase and I wish I knew how to play :)
3,Flute lullabies,"An adequate collection of music, but perhaps less satisfying than the Shakuhatchi Japanese Flute CD. This recording presents the listener with traditional lullabies, some of which are probably so well known that they are a little trite by virtue of over exposure. For those, however, who are unfamiliar with traditional Japanese music or with the haunting sounds of the bamboo flute, this would make a good place to start."
4,Great cd,"this is a good cd, some songs are slow, but good. If this is your first time buying ghoulies cds I recomend you to buy fun in the dark, is much better, but for the second cd, I recomend you this one."
2,Low price and low quality,"I'm a inflated bed fan since I was a student in the past three years with frequently moving. Three month ago, I bought this for my mother-in-law when she's coming visit us.Now it is just broken after only 3 month usage. One seal breaks (I did not do any funcy thing on it). As a compare, my two and half years old aerobed is still working good without any leaking.Pumping gas into this bed is much more difficult than into my aerobed.BTW, it's too soft, macro-soft.Price is low, which earns one more star for it."
4,NOT JUST A TRAVEL GUIDE,"just recently bought this book and was satisfied with the images presented...i agree that this book is neither a travel guide nor a cross section of the country (as what the author addressed) but it captures the heart and soul of the motherland. it invokes some images where everyone who grew up here can feel and relate the sincerity and simpleness of everyday people's lives captured on film....i wish we can have more books like these about the philippines. this was published 1999, i guess its time for more updated versions about the philippines...."
4,Excellent snapshot of the Philippines,"This book provides a nice snapshot of what the Philippines culture is like in the 21st century. The Philippines is a maddening mix of Christianity, old world values, and new world tastes. The pictures of the Markets, beaches, and people show the beauty and diversity of the islands."
2,16 miles is 100% BS,"I have a pair of these and they work but no way will they go 16 miles. I did a test and they won't even go 1 mile. I tried the high power channels. This was line of sight test too. I could see where my other radio was and it wouldn't work. They are not good for heavy populations either. Too many people have the same channels and you hear tons of other people talking. If you live in a highly populated area, I would sugest a radio with a security feature that scrambles your signal. Other than that they are good for short communication. I give it only 2 stars because they are not being truthful about the distance."
5,Very Satisfied,"Great product at a good price. They work very well around the farm and woods, even in hilly areas. They are light and easy to use. Batteries hold charge for a long time. Charger stand is convenient and nice."
5,Scarey Beginning,"The five stars are actually for Amazon, the radios would get zero stars for the first set, and four for the second.I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my husband (and me!) We live in a two-story house on a large rural property, and our cell phones don't work from downstairs or the spring from which we pump water. There are days when I have trouble with the stairs, or we need to communicate between the house and the spring box. The radios were to be the perfect solution. After charging them the required 24 hours we found we couldn't get them to work without an unacceptable amount of static. We tried everything, even calling the manufacturer, who said they were defective and to return them to the point of purchase.The service from Amazon was INCREDIBLE!!!! Very easy return, even paid by them. And they sent the replacements within two days of my contacting them. Oh yeah, and the new radios work perfectly."
5,One of my best purchases,This was one of my best purchases for the kids. They have been played with so much I couldn't even tell you. They do have a long ranges for kids to play with as well. They are very sturdy as well. Well played with in our house.
4,pretty cool,"I bought these for my 11 yr old son and he's really enjoyed them. He and my husband did I test to see if it would work just 2-3 miles from the house but they didn't. So he mostly just uses them around here, which was my intention when I got them. We do live in an area that is very hilly, so I'm not sure if that's what the problem is. Either way, they work great for just playing in the neighborhood and it comes in crystal clear."
3,Average,"The radios are really light weight and small. The distance is great and there no distoration, and you can pick up the other party very clearly. the only problem i am having is to charge the batteries, it came with rechargeables but they are not taking charge."
1,moderate,"The product seems ok - but it is hard to tell because one of the batteries was not working. Charging for 24+ hours resulted in nothing. Since it was the Christmas holiday, the company was closed until yesterday. I called, and after a little runaround, a new battery is now being sent to me. I will be able to tell more about the product when both radios are in working order."
1,Order Canceled for No Apparent Reason,"It's Christmas season and I placed this order online four days ago only to get an e-mail today saying the order has been canceled. Amazon and its suppliers should not be saying ""in stock"" on items that apparently will not ship."
4,captain morgan neon clock,"This ""out of stock"" item still managed to arrive before Christmas. Great clock for any fan of Captain Morgan & Neon."
4,good book but now very dated,"it's amazing how far we've come in the 9 years since this book was published. 1n the early 90's when this book was published there were many who thought that this country was in trouble. however, after 1993 the economy rebounded for almost 7 years of unpresedented growth and undemployment. nelson talks as if he wants to do away with the military altogether now that the cold war is over. now we know that that is just unrealistic as our country faces a new war against terrorism.but nelson makes an admirable effort at talking about issues that face a generation that know one really cares about. had i read this book when it came out, i probably would have thought that it was a bible for our generation. unfortunately the idea was never updated, and now our generation is once again without a poliical voice."
3,well...,"this video is classic glamrock. no new fight footage, but there is ego oozing out of the video as soon as you open it. it was entertaining at certain points. who would have thought that wearing socks could help you get a leg lock?"
3,"promising writer, needs editor","I just finished this book, having read every word eagerly. I will look for her other novels.However, I must say that I decided on the killer early in the book, never suspected anyone else, and at the end was proved right. Also, there is much descriptive and conversational repetition throughout--a good editor might have pointed this out.The reasons this book was enjoyable were the interesting characters and brisk pace (even though in 19th C. England, the lifestyle was slower from ours).I hope her writing improves; the story was entertaining!"
3,Entertaining,"Once you look past the almost inevitable coincidences that shape the mystery, you find a fun little romp. Rogow - who is also a very talented filk song writer in the sci-fi community - creates lively characters and makes Lewis Carroll live again (even if Conan Doyle is a bit of a stiff). PErfect beach reading."
3,ReliOn Humidifer Filter,"The filter is okay. It doesn't seem to be exactly the same as the ones I have purchased at the store, but they work fine."
4,Quick delivery,"fast delivery, arrived as described in the product description. For a ""use & throw away"" device, this product is priced just right!"
5,ReliOn Filter,"It works as well as the filter that came with the product. It's not something I can go wild about, you know?"
4,Couldn't find product anywhere!,I got the filters half the price that normal ones usually go for in the stores! Plus i couldn't find this model in retail stores! I received the product a few days after what i expected.
2,"I got a substitution brand, I don't know how the one I ordered would have worked.",I did not get what I ordered. I got was suppose to work instead.
3,Humidifier filter,"We need a humidifier for dry air. The product needs replacement filters. I would rather not have to get filters, but so be it. the filters need to be changed monthly if the product is used a lot. (It is used overnight for sleeping). The purchase of the filters on Amazon was convenient since Walmart ( who sold the unit does not carry the filters. The product is not expensive so the filters cost almost as much as the unit so I guess next time we will just buy a new one. And buy one set of filters and then a new one again."
2,Description misleading,"I ordered what was called ""WF813 ReliOn Humidifier Replacement Filter (2 Pack)"" just to find out they are NOT ReliOn brand filters. They are another brand that come close to fitting some ReliOn humidifier models. However, the filter isn't quite as big as a real ReliOn WF813 filter, so it doesn't truly fit as well as it should. These are BestAir brand filters, and the box lists the humidifier models that these filters fit, and ReliOn is NOT one of them. These filters will probably do the job, but this ad is deceptive. I won't buy from this seller again."
3,High shipping,This was what I wanted but found the shipping costs to be very high for the weight. Make sure you order more than 1 to make up for it.
2,not the same,This was not the same as what came in the box...the dimensions are slightly different. yes it works but it is not the same. I won't buy it again.
2,Moldy Fast!,"These filters were the right size for our humidifier but we went through them so fast. One would get extremely moldy after 1-2 weeks of use, which made all the water and inside of our humidifier start to get moldy. We ended up getting a different filter size of better quality and trimming it down."
1,Didn't fit,In the description it clearly states with which humidifiers this filter works. It doesn't even fit mine and mine is one on the list.
5,Great product,High quality. Easy to replace. Durable. Love that I could order replacement filters on line. Not easily found in my local stores.
3,Size is just a little bit bigger than original,"Size is just a little bit bigger than original, fits humidifier with a little difficulty, otherwise works just fine. The original filter had an aluminum center, this one doesn't and bends when wet and heavy."
4,"Got Mine Today, Measures Up So Far","Just got these today, the tape measure reveals that they are 6"" X ""4 X 2"" just like the original ReliOn that came with the machine. Quality appears similar; this one actually has a thin metal strip around the middle of the longest perimeter of the filter that the OEM did not, which might help reinforce it some compared to the original OEM. Reinforce is relative; because I like our Hunter humidifier better, which has two permanent, hard filters that can be cleaned and reused. I will update later if these replacement ReliOn filters don't fit the bill."
1,unlike wf813,"Too soft, with no ridgidity to support itself ,it is unlike the original. It sinks into the holder and does not support itself for air to pass through. We do Not reccomend this filter at all. Do not buy!"
2,Not real crazy about this product,"This is indeed a replacement filter, but not the best quality. They were smaller than the ones with the foil between the foam layers and just overall chinzy."
1,The item in the picture is not what you actually get,"The picture depicts wide (7 mm wide x 37 mm long) erasers that almost fill the width of the tube. This is actually a picture of PaperMate item 64892. What you get if you order this product is item 64891 (about 4 mm wide x 14 mm long, with a metal retaining clip), which is NOT INTERCHANGEABLE with 64892."
2,Only one E!,"They have 2 of all the important letters except E. If you need this to spell anything with 2 E's (like I wanted to)- you will need to buy two. But, the letters are cute."
5,"Humor, Horror and Who-dunit, ALL IN ONE","For a first book, Unusual Destiny is unusually good. A fast paced read that has a herione, not unlike Evanovich's Stephanie Plum. If you're looking for humor twists and horror turns this is the book for you."
1,Not Compatable,"This dock has many cool features that fit what I wanted very well. It is too bad that this dock requires special software that is incompatible with almost everything.The description of this device is very vague. It connects through a pc card slot and your laptop must have this port for you to use this dock. The computer that I wanted to use this on did not have one. I used the dock on a different computer that did have this dock, but the software would not run. It only runs in Windows Vista and Windows XP. I ran the software in each of these environments but it still claimed that it was incompatible with the operating system.Unless you have a computer that is still running XP or Vista and has a pc card slot and you are willing to risk the product still not working. Do not buy this!"
1,Does not work with windows Vista !!!!!!!!!!,This docking station does not work with windows Vista! I downloaded the Vista compatible driver for the ACP60 from the Targus website. It will not install! I called the Targus tech support and it was a joke. I know as much as they do! Then the guy said that vista has 18 things you have to disable to make it work! I told them to email me the list. He said that there are too many versions of Vista to do that. I will probablly send it back too like the other guy wrote in his review.
1,Very Dissapointed,"Adding multiple monitors to your work station has been proven to increase productivity. I was excited at the possibility of a docking station for my laptop that would add an external monitor.This docking station quickly squelched my enthusiasm.It just doesnt work and Targus support is unknowledgable and inattentive. The service agent wasn't even reading my troubleshooting emails, just pasting pre-written suggestions to similar problems.It was suppose to work with XP 32-bit but does not.Think twice before plunking down $200."
3,It does the job,"So far so good. My only complaint is that there is a noticeable drag. My laptop is pretty fast and it never hung up until I added this docking station so that I could use a large monitor, keyboard and mouse. It's not a huge problem but it can be annoying sometimes. I am only talking a few seconds, not minutes."
1,Be careful - Item not as pictured,"I ordered this hose because of the 2-3 inch heavy duty collar at the end, shown in the picture. The hose that arrived had the correct item number, but had just a regular brass hose end.I thought I was ordering something heavy duty, now it seems just like a regular hose."
3,Not nearly as flexible or kink resistant as it advertises,I am moderately pleased with the hose. It performs adequately. It is not nearly as flexible or kink resistant as it advertises.
4,Met my expetations,I wanted a 3/4 inch hose for the discharge from a sump pump. The hose is made in the USA and does the job.
3,questionable,"I have studied Maimonides for some time and have read his major writings. This study of selected parts of the Guide is difficult for me to take too seriously. The author, Dr. Bakan, is a psychologist, and like Freud he sees SEX everywhere. He says, for instance, that Genesis' term for the place touched on Jacob by the being representing God signifies by implication Jacob's Penis. Perhaps. That could be in line with the lovers representing God and Israel in Song of Songs. But based on no further evidence it seems a reach.Maimonides's book as a whole is substantially in agreement with the very practical Akiba of a thousand years before, therefore concerns the theories of Correspondence and Utility regarding Truth (Aristotle and Akiba respectively.) Maimonides obviously sees the conflict and recommends Utility for everyday things and correspondence for the more remote nature of things. The book gives much too much weight to Sex in proportion to its importance in Guide."
3,this book is okay...........,"This book's information is not all that accurate! some of the information is misplaced. but this is a good book for you to discovred King Tut for the first time! BUt if you want better information, buy King Tut by Anthany Powele"
4,Exam Style,"This book is a hasty review of Orgo, but it covers most of the MCAT material in relatively small number of pages. Although some diagrams are not very helpful, it tells you most of what you need. It is basically a good book if you are a time-pressed pre-med trying to take the MCAT in 2 months. If you have more time, I recommend reading over your orgo textbook once more and doing problem sets in various other MCAT preparation materials (the ones with only MCAT style problems). Hope this helps."
2,It will not prepare you for the MCAT,"It does not deal sufficiently with reactions. The questions are too easy. I don't have a problem with the questions being in discrete forms since one needs solid understanding of the materials (through discrete questions) before being able to tackle passage based questions. But, after having gone through about 50% of the book so far, I don't feel like I've improved in my knowledge base in Ochem. If you need very very basic questions, this book is for you. I get the feeling this book was put together in a hasty manner with little thought invested in the quality of the questions. I would not recommend this book."
1,Not the best book,"I bought all of the examcracker books- some were good, but this book was obviously hastily prepared- there are numerous typos as well as redundant questions. The title of the book makes it seem like you're going to get thorough practice in organic chemistry but all of the questions are too short and straightforward to be relevant to the MCAT. Unfortunately, I don't know of any good book for MCAT organic chemistry- it's certainly not this one, though."
4,Just what you expect.,"Pretty obvious what it is. Mine came brand new. Good explanations of answers in the back, better than physics. In the physics book, I kept asking how they get to use this one equation when taught another.What you're getting are 1,001 questions. Simple as that. It's not that special."
1,Too many errors.,"The first half hour I was pleased with the material working my way through molecular structure and bonding. Once stereo-isomers are introduced there are way too many errors to be useful. After researching multiple incorrect answers and finally confirming the material was wrong from a professor or on the student doctor network I gave up. The layout is great to confirm your understanding of basic information, but the book was poorly executed. There is a section for corrections on the Examkrackers forum but there are NO postings. If you have a solid understanding of organic basics this book will be of little use to you, and if you need a review of the basics you will probably not know the material well enough to recognize an error immediately. Purchase the 1001 series at your own risk."
4,Great for taking the dogs anywhere,"Mainly, we use this for the water capacity. It's great to give our girls a good drink after a long day at the dog park or on any road trip when the weather is hot. My only ""complaint"" is that this is smaller than our previous one and the food storage lid gets caught on the cargo netting in the back of our truck and pops off."
2,"Pretty bulky, huge, easy to lose caps","This was bigger than I thought, but that's my fault. My biggest issue is that you cannot really clean the inside of the product which worries me due for health reasons. I used for one weekend trip, but I need something much more portable."
1,"Lousy book, I want my money back!",The purported objective book is nothing but blatant character assassination based on hearsay and unsubstantiated allegations.
3,Not so good,"The area reviewed is one of the most beautiful in Wisconsin. However the book had no pictures. Maps would help orient one to where they actually are in the area. Descriptions of places ommitted important information. An example was the description of Hotel Chequamagon - the book ommitted the fact that this hotel is located right on the shores of Lake Superior. Price ranges for all lodging, eateries, etc. would be a help. There were no website addresses. With some updating this would be a much better reference for this lovely place."
3,C Plus,"Egyptian musician, good music. but borrows heavy from house/dance music beats, however does incorporate traditional sounds from the Arabic speaking culture."
5,Just Cards,"These are good decks of cards, I mean you can mess up playing cards much so these make the cut. The size takes some getting use too but when playing games with a large amount of cards in your hands throughout it is a real advantage having smaller cards. But, if I was able to reorder I would most likely go for the standard size card just for the normality of it."
2,Poor Quality,"Made in China.My bed had an inner seam busted out after 8 months, resulting a huge bulge right in the center of the bed. No leakage of air on my bed thought.This bed is not made by Simmons and is not serviced by Simmons.You have to call Air Sleep Systems at 800-247-0677 for assistance. Return shipping for warranty claim is not covered.I am on my 3rd (including the original) replacement bed. The first two all failed the same way. Let see how long the new one holds up.I give it two stars because amazon gave me two beds for the price of one. Otherwise, one star."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I previously slept on the twin size of this mattress several times (guest at my mom's) and found it quite comfortable and solid. I'm now in temp quarters for several months and decided an air mattress is my best bet for sleeping, so I bought the queen size. HUGE mistake. It is the identical model but does not hold air.I put air in it every night and never feel like it's fully inflated; it softens within minutes and then stays at that softer position all night. I am waking up every morning feeling like someone has set fire to my muscles, I am in so much pain. Will have to find a better solution in a hurry. Very disappointed in the product, absolutely would not recommend."
2,Cheap but not comfirtable and not worth it for long,I bought this air bed 8 months before and i am hardly slept on this. now it has developed leak on upper middle side and that leakage is not stopable. i tried to contact manufacturer but not got succeeded. so beware of buying this air bed.
4,Tight powerful bass,"This is the best reasonably priced powered subwoofer around. It has tons of power and gives a nice tigght bass sound - not overly boomy. There is a dial on the top to adjust output. (My daughter LOVES to play with the dial when we are not looking . . .)The only reason I deducted one star is that the subwoofer is always powered on. It does not have a circuit to simply sense when there is a signal to power itself on. Others have that, but I'm sure it uses very little power when not in use.It is heavy and looks great."
5,Caroline and the Raider,"I just couldn't put this book down. I found it incredibly interesting, exciting and very sexy. This is a ""must read"" for all who love romance novels!!!!"
3,ok,I felt this book was a take it or leave it book. Parts were very slow and predictable but then it would pick up for awhile and slow back down
5,Well written,"This book was part of a trilogy artfully crafted by Linda Lael Miller. In the series, three sisters are separated at a young age and go on to live their lives, always wanting to reconnect. Linda weaves the stories with skill and detail that traverse each book. Dashes of 'heat' infused with humor keep the reader's attention and soon you realize you have finished the book and look forward to reading another one. I highly recommend you read, ""Emma and the Outlaw"" and ""Lilly and the Major"" as companion books."
3,Frances,"I am a fan of Linda Lael Miller and have read several of her books. My favorite read is a historical romance. This book has a really good plot and the characters are interesting. The interaction between Caroline and Guthrie will make you smile, especially Guthrie's approach to dealing with complex and impulsive Caroline. The one problem I had with this book and hence the 3 stars only, was while the romance aspect was very sensual and definitely added to the book, that part of their relationship was repeated so often and in so much detail that I became bored and was skipping those sections. The other books of this author have great sensual component to her stories, but this one was just overdone."
2,Desperado alternative,"hi all! i ALSO came looking for Sarah Bolger's version of Desperado. If you are looking for an equally heartbreaking rendition, albeit slightly different, i highly suggest The Langley Schools Music Project, Innocence and Despair. it is an insanely good cd made from recordings from an elementary school chorus in canada in the 70s, and all of the songs are pop or rock songs(a lot of bowie, beach boys, a fleetwood mac song...). one of them is desperado, sung by a girl with a similar voice. i actually looked to see if sarah bolger sang the song or lip synched it off of this little girl.anyway, the whole cd is haunting and beautiful and enchanting. depserado is absolutely one of the highlights, just like in the movie."
5,Where's Desperado?,I think I cried just as much to find out that Desperado is not on the soundtrack as I did when Sarah Bolger sang the song. The most moving part of the movie and no one thought to include the song so that we could all remember how it felt to let someone love you. I'm outraged!
5,Vocal author of Desperado,"Actually, Sarah Bolger was given credit for singing ""Desperado"" in the movie."
2,No Desparado on this recording!,"What a disapointment. I wish I had read the reviews before spending my money. The album is nice, but I would not have bought it if I had known. Where can I find Sarah singing Desparado??"
1,"""Desperado"" was THE ONLY reason to buy the soundtrack",I think it was one of the best movies of the last 5 years but the stupidity of omitting this track stuns me.It's the only track that I wanted.It is the emotional center of the movie and Bolger nails it.WTF???????
3,Where's Desperado?,I came to buy this album specifically for the song Desperado as sung by the little girl. Where can I find the track????
2,The BEST version of Desperado...EVER!!!!,"I'm a big fan of The Eagles, but this version is the all-time greatest. And this is NOT the Langley School version which, while good, is inferior to Sarah's version. A true crime against humanity to withhold a clear recording of Sarah's performance. I have heard a recording off the DVD and it isn't the same as a studio released version which they could easily do.Note to studio pinheads: Release this as a single or add to the soundtrack and we'll all buy it!!! please!!!!"
3,"Can't Believe ""Desperado"" isn't on here","I can't believe that ""Desperado"" as sung by Sarah Bolger isn't on this soundtrack -- it's a terrible shame. I would've bought this CD just for that track, but alas, it's not on the CD. How about a CD single?"
3,Desperado,"I am almost sure the Desparado music track used in the film was not sung by Sarah Bolger. She was not given credit for it. Plus it is IDENTICAL to the Langley Schools Project version.If she really sang it, why not include it on the CD? I am sure you left the theater humming the theme, ""Mateo Goes Home"" because it was so memorable...Check out the Langley Schools Project CD...it is cool."
5,Love this product!!,"This is my second bottle of this oil. I have only tried this one flavor but it tastes like a sugar cookie, it will not get sticky or dry out. It makes an amazing lubercaint as well. I highly recommend this product for all the multi uses it can be used for. A+++++++"
1,"ZERO stars, I was FORCED to put ""1""","The whole point of this book, again, is to criticize the original Rules. This book manifests Barbara's spitefulness, jealiousy of the Rules' authors, and VAST greediness. This book was written to take advantage of those feminists who are critical of the original Rules- take advantage of your pocketbook I mean. Don't waste your money or time."
1,FAIRY TALES,"I just don't understand why she has to keep viciously attacking ""The Rules"" ? Maybe Barbara thinks that she is entitled to do so as she is a self-proclaimed relationship ""expert"". All said and read, this book offers nothing but rules that you can use if you are Cinderella or Snow White - i.e. you live in a fairy tale. All her ""Real Rules"" are just idealistic textbook type of principles which are just impractical. I think your money would be better spent on any book by Ellen Kreidman rather than on the pedantic, preachy awaful stuff expounded in this book."
1,Barbara DeAngelis is all wet,"Having read The Rules and Rules II thoroughly, I find that Ms. DeAngeles is not making her comments about The Rules factually.She has completely missed the point and set about to make The Rules look bad. Her comments are not completely on point, and they make me think of some of the mis-truths going around the web about politicians, etc. She is trying to make it seem that she has superior knowledge - when in fact I don't think she even read the book, but skimmed over it. Her points are off-base."
5,Excellent Rules to Live By,"This book taught me a great deal about being authentic in a relationship, and how important it is to not play mind games with someone, but to be honest, even if it's hard to do.I really learned that self honesty has to come first, before we can be honest with another person.If you want to be able to be in a relationship that you can count on, and that can grow, get this book, because it will teach you a lot about the games we think we have to play, and why they are so wrong.This is an Excellent Book!!"
1,Awful,"Deep down, I think that Barbara de Angelis DOES agree with The 'Old'Rules. Half of what she says in this book is exactly what the other book says or stuff that everyone should already know about relationships such as watch out for warning signs or don't fall in love with a man's potential.I have just ended a relationship with a guy who I did the old rules on and yes, I was myself with him. I ended it because I sensed that he was just wasting my time. How did I know? By using the old rules, he always left it till the last minute for weekend dates, I got no flowers etc and no invitation to his flat/appartment - EVER! Obviously he was hiding something!"
1,Awful,"""The Real Rules"" is nothing but real bad advice. Sure, it's the 90's, ""The Real Rules"" is the way things *should* be- but things aren't. Gender politics can be reduced to hysterics if you go around screaming your ideals and not accepting reality and trying to change that. This is exactly what De Angelis does- she writes a fine book for another society where all their weird sex relation problems have been worked out. Not recommended AT ALL. Go buy ""The Rules"" by Ellen Fein for some actual results, not a preachy idealistic knockoff."
1,Not recommended,"All I can say is good luck to anyone who reads this book and believes that it will help them to find the right man. Although the advice in it may seem straightforward, following it in the early dating stages is dangerous. I have applied the real rules in some of my past relationships and have gone through some severe pain as a result and if the old rules did not exist then I would still be alone now and getting hurt by men. Treating men the way you would like them to treat you does not work in real life and that is why so many women are not married or in good relationships.This book is for you if you are prepared to go through much pain for several years before finding your ideal soulmate. However, most of us do not wish to wait several years for love and most of all we do not want to get hurt any more.I do not recommend this book as a dating guide - more of a guide on how to become vulnerable to men and go through more heartache."
2,Redundant,"After the first chapter or so, I just skipped to the summaries in the back. Here the information is much more concise and not so boring to read."
5,A Must Read if You Want a REAL Relationship,"Credit to Barbara for her courage in sharing what it takes to have a REAL relationship.I read the other book - ""The Rules"" and found how disempowering it was for women to feel they have to act a certain way, pretend to be what they ""think"" a man wants, rather than have the guts to be their true selves. This book is truly a MUST READ if you want a lasting relationship, based on honesty, rather than mating tactics. Excellent for BOTH men and women!"
4,If you feel guilty tricking a boy into loving you...,"De Angelis writes this book in response to THE RULES, but a lot of her ""Real Rules"" are similar to that in the former. However, with her spin, doing ""the rules"" is not about self-denial and harsh tricks, but about going out and having fun, learning what you like and dont like in a man, and loving whom you choose. For those of you who have read the rules, are interested but are skeptical of its morale, i recomend this book instead, it is the rules for a REAL woman interested in finding not only a husband, but a lover, a soul mate, and a best friend."
2,views are too idealistic,"The book has some good points, but basically the things she says are just too idealistic. Yes, emotional commitments are very important between men & women, but so are the marriage certificate and engagement ring! We Singaporeans are very pragmatic people, so these ""hard evidence"" (of being married) matter a lot in our society.Her book also doesn't take into consideration the different communication styles of men & women. I don't think a person having problems in relationships (especially a novice) can learn much from her book.Better to read books by Dr. John Gray - Men from Mars, Women from Venus, Men/Women/Relationships and others."
4,Solid and Practical,"Barbara's perspective on the right ""rules"" for establishing a quality relationship with the ""right"" man are extremely practical. As I read, my first response was ""This is perfectly intuitive -- very common sense."" My second response was ""Yes, but how many of us actually remember to follow these rules?"" Particularly things like ""Pay attention to warning signs"". How many times do we say to ourselves, ""yes, that is a problem, but...""? Women owe it to themselves (and their eventual partners) to practice the ""real rules""."
2,Marketing strategy to outsell The Rules,"Barbara gives good advice & I own her books, but this one is simply an ill attempt at ""The Rules"" by Ellen Fein & Sherri Schneider, which was a bestseller. ""The Rules"" discusses dating with a straightforward approach while Barbara's book tries a more touchy-feely ""love is surreal and effortless"" approach. I am a psychology graudate student and I found ""The Rules"" by Ellen Fein & Sherri Schneider much more applicable to the norm."
5,Getting REAL So You Can Sustain a Healthy Relationship,"If you're looking to ""get"" ""capture"" or manipulate a man with false tactics, games, and pretenses, then this book will help you discover HOW and WHY to be REAL so you can have and sustain a healthy, genuine and authentic relationship.Games don't work, at all! This is a fantastic book that will help you honor yourself, honor the person you're with, and will help you bring out more of who you truly are, which is the foundation of any real and lasting relationship.HIGHLY recommended for its truth, authenticity, and the freeing and lasting effect it will bring to your relationship. Be real, and he will feel safe to be real with you. Deserves 10 Stars!Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE and Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence"
1,This women has been married about 6 times!!,I find it very ironic that a women who has been married and divorced so many times finds herself competant enough to give advice on relationships! Even stranger..one of her husbands was John Gray. The author of Men are from Mars and women from Venus. PLEASE!!!!
4,"Was used as part of a magic prop, rather than as a toy","The fun and educational value of this toy depends on its use. On the simplest level, it is a goofy prop or Halloween decoration, like a rubber spider or skeleton. It's good for a quick laugh, not sustained play for a child.I used it as a teaching tool in a magic trick--I transformed a picture of a glass of milk into a plastic skeleton and the chattering teeth in a dove pan. For that purpose, the teeth were highly educational"
1,Never worked,"It simply didn't work right out of the box. While it was not expensive, it was a true waste of money for a junky piece of plastic that doesn't work. Made in China...."
2,"Not Bad, But Not Too Informative","It's true that ""In Search of Ice Age Americans"" is a fascinating tale of the history of first Americans research and of the joys and difficulties that go into the search for the elusive Paleoamerican cultures that first inhabited this continent so many thousands of years ago. If you want a joyful read with beautiful color photographs of Paleoamerican artifacts, then this book is for you.Unfortunately, ""In Search of Ice Age Americans"" provides little new insight into the quest for the first Americans. It is true that this is difficult with so many books being published on this topic, but that leads me to the question, ""What's the point of one more?"" If you're just in it for fun, therefore, this book is a nice, well-written read. If you're a student of archeology looking for fresh, new insight into this topic, look somewhere else!"
2,Chewable,Within days of purchase -- has multiple holes in fence -- where animals have simply chewed thru the plastic -- for us this fence does not keep anything in or out ...
4,animals can chew through this,"i used this to start a compost pile with. it was easy to cut and easy to install, i used wire ties to secure it closed. but i found out that animals can chew threw it... the squirrels made a little hole so they can get in there and eat the tasty bits. its not that inconvenient (yet) but i imagine it could be."
3,Product is OK but you don't get 25 feet!,"I ordered two rolls of this poultry fencing for a 6 ft high fence. After attaching the netting to six fence stakes I discovered one roll was only 22ft, 8inch instead of 25ft! Called Tenax and they offered no consideration for their mistake...told me to return it. Wasted 3 hours of my time for their mistake."
4,This is where I want to live...,"Something about this movie struck a nerve. I grew up in a small town. They are both beautiful and slightly evil in the way everyone knows everyone else's business. Yet, nothing really feels quite as comfortable and warm as returning home after being gone for awhile. This movie will give you a taste of that.Mumford may not be for everybody. It is a quiet movie, sometimes funny. There is a little love story, and a half-hearted mystery. Some of the characters are not fully developed, and some of the story seems implausible. However, this is kind of how small town life is. Anyone who's grown up in a small town has seen some strange things. You see, in a city you may hear about many strange things, but in a small town you live them.Mumford will tug a bit at your heart, leave you slightly warm, and then slowly drift away. But, it's always nice to come back home."
4,An Endangered Species,"A very decent/charming high comedy, complete with nose-tweaks for the hilarious, if always booming, professional self/other-help industry. Do NOT worry about the presence of Ted. Do NOT worry about the irritating but forgivable excesses of L.A. or popular songs in certain previous Kasdan movies. Do worry, if you like, about effete filmfops &/or innocent youthful punks bombarded with emptily cute (or darkly [t]witty or jest plain bloody hip) cinema satire forgetting what comedy is? ""Mumford"" seeks to engage audience attention, is realistic rather than neo/hyper-realistic, sage instead of sensational. It flows, doesn't JUMP, must seem AWFULLY slow to the extravagantly Web-savvy? Beautiful though, human-sized, sharp without being ungenerous. If we drive this kind of movie entirely out of the marketplace, we will all feel, & be, poorer? Especially recommended as balancing for slickers have enjoyed assorted recent artsier exaggerations of small town life."
3,Odd movie,"It's difficult to judge this movie. It's very peculiar. The story is certainly unusual. The characters are odd. Even the acting was odd. Not bad, just weird.A psychologist in a small town sees a strange array of cases, ranging from classic pornography obsession to chronic fatigue syndrome. The town has lots of secrets, but none quite like that of the therapist. Ethics and therapy technique are challenged when he falls for one of his patients.This isn't a bad movie by any means. It's just hard to describe because it's so unusual. After seeing it, you're left with neither a good nor a bad feeling."
1,A must miss!,"Warning: This movie contains Ted Danson. Be Careful, this has been known to kill braincells, especially in the northern Cali, carrot-muffin, NPR types at whom this movie is targeted. Find your psychobabble somewhere else."
3,A so so movie.,This movie was not a grate movie but it was not the boringist movie or all together worst movie I have ever seen. I say if you first pick is took rent this.
1,dull and insulting,"Mumford is a film about a ""psychologist"" who lives in a small idyllic town, and deals with his patients in a way that seems to annoy them but keeps them coming back. Could it be that Loren Dean happens to look like a model? He also has the charm and acting abilities of a model, which is to say none.Hope Davis steals the show here, although what she was doing in this film is beyond explanation.The film does not let the viewer get deep inside any of the characters, certainly what should be paramount in a film that deals with human nature, love, and anxiety. Instead we are offered a script that is so obvious I imagined a five year old with a crayon scribbling it down during recess before submitting it to the studio.Before you settle down with this film expecting a cozy little vignette about relationships be warned, it is chock full of unnecessary swearing and breast flashing. The review I read likened it to a Frank Capra film; well, you're much better off with the real thing."
4,Nice Film,"This movie is about a psychologist, Dr. Mumford and his life in the town of the same name. The story is great and it is neat to see how the lives of the characters inter wind with each other. It is a relatively strong movie for a cast that was not well known to me. This is a good movie and definitely worth seeing! Recommended!!"
5,A Fun Movie From Start To Finish,This movie has some of the most interesting characters I've seen in the past couple years. The many characters of this movie are all presented with very interesting and very unique stories. This is one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen. This is one worth adding to your DVD collection.
1,Ripped Off ...,"I can't watch this DVD, as it is registered for a region other than the U.S. (Europe). I can't seem to change the region to the U.S., which means this purchase was a total loss. Quite a disappointment. The cost of returning the DVD would be almost as much as the purchase price, so it isn't worth it."
1,A Great Movie But Unacceptable Product,"The copy I received only played on my computer disc drive - it would not play on my TV disc player. The packaging, appearance and condition of disc is suspect...I think it was a bootleg copy."
5,Wonderful retelling of old fairy tale,"This was the first book by Ms. Wrede that I ever read. I enjoyed the characters, setting, and use of real people. I also enjoyed the elements from the original that she kept and how she incorporated them into her version. A very satisfying read.Please, please, please re-release this book!"
4,An interesting look at an old fairy tale.,"As a lover of fairy tales, this book was right up my alley. A well written, welll developed book, with a nice amount of historical background. The characters were reasonably good, and the intregration of the old fairytale text was very well done"
4,Lovely story,"Patricia Wrede has created a beautiful rendition of the original fairy-tale. I enjoyed the characters and felt that she did a wonderful job of adding background to the bones of a story I already knew well. Whilst this novel stayed true to the fairy-tale it was not by rote. There was enough intrigue and character building to make it a little more adult and work as a novel- I never felt she added filling to bulk the story out, or that the story lagged. All in all I really enjoyed this book, even knowing how it was likely to end did not diminish the journey."
4,Good but distracted by all the Thee's and Tho's,It was great as a faerie book with a little romance but the language got distracting. This is a good book for those who love a good retelling of a fairy tale.
5,mf delicious!!,"the best kind of delicious salty thinish/crisp chip....just like only the east coast can offer! JUST LIKE I REMEMBER, BUT BETTER!"
2,Kinda boring,"I am a newly licensed therapist who recently took EMDR. I'm hoping to build a practice doing EMDR with children and adolescents, which is why I bought this book. I had a hard time reading this book; it was a little dry and heavy on the details of every session. I did like being introduced to cases and seing how EMDR was helpful, but I basically skim-read the book, and I'm not sure that it was worth buying. Maybe it would be of more interest to parents who are interested in EMDR for their children. I am hoping that ""EMDR and the Art of Psychotherapy with Children"" by Adler-Tapia & Settle or ""Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing in Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy"" by Ricky Greenwald will be able to help me more."
5,A Perfect Guide to Achieving Inner Peace,"With life's complications weighing on our shoulders it is only natural to seek ways to simplify and improve the quality of our lives and those that surround us. Such methods are described in this wonderfully written book. Through the simplistic process of mentoring, knowledge is unselfishly shared with others, creating an unmeasurable positive impact on their lives. Unknowingly, in return, our lives are positively impacted as well. The author reinforces that our own personal growth begins with encouraging growth in others. The message, although very elementary, has had a profound effect on my relationship building skills with my family, co-workers, and friends."
3,Huffy Avarice,"I got the bike on time. It is a very nice bike but I haven't had a chance to try it since it's missing some parts, so I can put the handlebar post or seat post in. One of the pedals does not fit either. Otherwise I feel is a good purchase.I will post again after I get to ride it. Should have fun finding a bike shop now!"
1,Tompall Glaser My Notorious Youth,"Not the best of Tompall. I have another album which is great. I do not recommend this one, but he and his brothers do the best harmony in country music."
4,Awesome writing!,"I've read a lot of nonfiction 'poetry/memoir' books and most make me want to gag, but Debra's book made me smile and nod my head in agreement. So many of the subjects she writes about are so real that more than likely we've all gone through them. She really knows how to get to the heart of things and make it all real again. I look forward to reading her next novel. If it's as good as this one, I'll be shelling out the bucks for it!"
4,Great Debut,"I recently received my copy of this book and I could relate to many of the stories. By sharing her memories with us, the common bond of recognition is developed. Debra has written a thoughtful and revealing book that easily touches all of us."
2,Too Light,"Some of his other work is much better. This book seams rushed, almost like the author did not want to take the time to really develop either the story or the characters. Because of the light development it does not hold your attention. I just did not believe the characters. I kept waiting for it to get better which is why I toughed it out to the end, but I was disappointed overall."
4,Fine swing from two masters,"While Zoot & Sweets did record together during their ""peak"" years in the late 1950's, to my knowledge they never cut an LP where they were the two prime movers as Edison did with Ben Webster (see Ben and Sweets). At least not until this Pablo (ie. Norman Granz) session from 1978. But it was worth the wait. This disc features Edison and Sims backed by only a rhythm section and trading riffs over 8 charts and 42 minutes of music. Granted, neither is in top form and I think Zoot outshines Sweets in this outing, but there's still plenty of creativity and swinging to go around. On a few tunes Roger Kellaway opts for an electric piano which gives it ""that 70's feeling"" but otherwise it's a solid collection of standards, blues and ballads. Recommended if you like the small group swing genre."
3,Mixed Feelings,I bought this on recommendation of a friend. It did provide some focus and some positivity - however it was not as astounding as some of the other reviews made it sound. I guess it's all about relativity and experience - previous and present.
5,NANA AT HER BEST,FABULOUS CD WITH NANA AT HER BEST! YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS CD IT WILL FILL YOUR HEART AND MIND WITH THE JOY OF CHRISTMAS PAST.
4,youth sentiments,"I could not buy this CD in my home-country. To me this belongs to my youth, every year at X-mas my parents played this on LP. I wanted to have it also, and bought 1 for my parents too. So I already knew it and it satified my expectations."
3,Not up to my expectations,"I ordered ""Christmas with Nana Mouslouri"" with the expectation of high quality: the reviews were excellent and what I heard on the sampler led me to believe that this CD would be a good addition to my holiday library.I like a fully supported voice that has clear, unmuddied tones. I found parts of different songs to be a bit off-key and the voice ""crackly."" At times I cringed: some songs were rather tentatively rendered and the singer seemed a bit ""old womanish."" This may be a purposeful ""style"" that is just not appealing to me.All in all the purchase was a disappointment."
4,"Dries quick, but expensive","I have tried a million top coats, but this one is the best for quick drying to prevent ruining that fresh manicure.Doesn't prevent chips as well as others, but definitely good for drying."
2,Disappointed!,"I researched like crazy and came across this top coat. I agree that it dries fast and looks great, but my nails always chip when I use it! I don't think it protects your color and keeps it for days. I to Essie no chips ahead, which has worked great. I wish this topcoat just didn't make my nails chip!"
5,Yelling Aardvarks,"This album is a great album. ""Hey Suburbia"", ""Achtung"", and ""Soap Opera"" are my favorites. Well, almost every song is a favorite, but those three are the best in my opinion. The Screeching Weasels are a group of f*ck ups that make some f*cked up music for some f*cked up people and we all get f*cked up and f*ck each other up to it. I love this record and couldn't go without it. Pick it up or at least give it a listen. This was pop punk before the sh*t you hear today. But the difference is, this is good."
5,Best SW album!,"If you like SW, this is the album to buy. It doesn't go together as an album (since its a compilation) but that's half the fun. Fast, fun, punky, quirky, and raw."
3,"Amazing study, not the best book to ""read""",This is an incredibly researched book indeed. A wealth of data and pictures. I think it could have been a bit better with a little more narrative about the albums and singles. Anecdotes and interviews about the tracks would have made it even better.
4,eye-opening...,"I'd just like say that this book is absolutely fantastic! It is so well written that Boothe is able to pull you into Japan through his colorful style. If you want to know more about Japanese culture and how foreigners are regarded there, along with some very interesting and funny stories, this is a first hand account of what to expect. You will be amazed..."
4,Fun Travel Thru Japan,This book builds slowly giving an almost daily account of the authors' impressions of the people and places of Japan. It offers many interesting insights into Japan and the author himself. Mr. Booth is a fun person to travel thru Japan with.
2,Presents just one side of the Japan experience,Having lived in Japan for a long time I found this book disappointing. As another reader stated above it is written from a man's perspective and experiences in Japan. I had a hard time relating to much of his book. Alan writes for the gaijin man in Japan. I know if a gajin woman were to repeat his journey the tale would be much different. I am sure many long-timers would agree.
2,"Not worth the hike to write it, let alone the cover price to buy it","The guy hikes the length of Japan yet doesn't have anything to say. One would think that after a 4 month trek across a country and a culture that one would have something pithy to opine about but sadly Booth doesn't. The guy slogs across sweltering landscape, doesn't see much that is interesting or worthy of description, drinks at the end of each day, then suddenly finishes with the anti-climax of ""...oh yeah, I met my wife and talked to a reporter and Japan is not understandable"" The end.M'kay...So, who do I have to see about getting a refund from Amazon?"
1,Wrong size paper,"The paper is fine but the size was not what I wanted- It was legal paper. I don't see how I was supposed to know this based on the description (Xerox Multi-purpose white papers, business, Recyled, 20 lb (75G/M2), 30% Post Con). It seems clear to me that they should include the size in inches or else terms that the average person is used to. ""Business"" implied 8x11 to me. Also I thought I was getting a box with many packets of paper- instead I got only 1 packet. The picture showed a full box--again- a very misleading description of the product."
4,Smooth Southern Sax,"I am the producer of this project. I have known Kyle for many years and am biased but he is a great musician that deserves a LOT more exposure. He is one of those rare finds that has both great technique and an even bigger soul of expression. Most jazz products are not big money makers, but often these CDs are pushed by those of us who truly believe in an artist. This Collection CD, features songs from Kyle's previous 3 records along with some new gems. I just say, give it a listen and you will be a fan. The opening track, ""Marathon"" shows of his high energy while the Janet cover of ""Anytime, Anyplace"" is pure classic. I personally enjoy the Darrell Lavigne penned, ""Scorpios Dance"". Hope you get to enjoy also. Thanks."
3,Good but not great tea,"I'm not much of a tea drinker. My exception is good jasmine green tea, and my favorite, if way too pricy, is Numi Monkey King. I bought this Stash tea on the recommendations posted by Amazon purchasers, and while the first cup is very good, subsequent uses of tea bag produce a bitter tea without the jasmine overlay. Perhaps my hot water dispenser is set too hot and it's burning the tea, but so far Stash's Premium YMY 1690 Jasmine Green Tea is not one I'll buy again."
3,not as described,"Battery listed as being by Apple, giving the impression that it's original, when in fact it is a clone, which was quite dissappointing as it was the reason I selected it over all the others. On the other hand it seems to work fine but as it only gets occassional use it is difficult to assess it's performance. just note that it's not what the listing claims."
3,It's OK,"It works, but it definitely feels like a non-OEM product, if you're fussy about your PowerBook then get an Apple battery."
3,Entertaining for sure.,"This movie is fun because the characters DON'T have depth. The whole point is to try and figure out which psychological profile is the one that they are trying to find for candidacy in their program. It was entertaining, and had a nice twist at the end that outdid Shyamalan's usual plot twist fare. Citizen Kane it is not, but I don't see the point in comparing this movie to the Usual Suspects. Apples and oranges and all that. Its more like a less gory Saw (the first one). And way to throw out the spoiler in the review, Buzz Killington. Handing out spoilers in a review doesn't convey your ire for the movie. What it does in fact do is irritate people who are going to purchase/watch the movie."
4,How to Make an American Terrorist,"Length:: 7:25 MinsHHH reviews The Killing Room from Jonathan Liebesman - the director of Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, & Darkness Falls"
3,The killing room,I give this movie three stars even though I didn't really like it. But if you like the Saw movies you will probably like this movie.
3,Why hide credentials?,"What I do not understand is why Dr. Colgan hides his credentials?It should say what his professional credentials are if he is claiming to be a doctor. It becomes clear he is not an M.D. and that may not be a big deal if he were to tell somewhere, anywhere in the book what exactly is he a doctor of.I am very supicious of a book by a person who is trying to be sneaky, bordering on deceptive by numerous references to his DOCTOR title."
5,For all ages,"I am mom to a toddler, aunt to a 12 yr old girl and 8 yr old boy, and reading tutor to three kids ages 6, 11, and 15. We all love learning from this book. Heller's Baby Fingers Teaching Your Baby to Sign board books for babies and toddlers have also been great for my toddler."
5,useful,"I think this book will be an asset to one of my preschool students and his mother. He does not have a hearing impairment, but is experiencing a serious delay in his spoken language. I'm hoping this book will provide a non-threatening introduction to an alternative communication system, that will lessen their frustration, and build some foundation of successful communication for this child and his mother."
5,Wonderful,This is the best out there on the market! Although I had to wait longer for the package to arrive because the original package got lost in the mail.
3,really sad ending....heart sank,"This story is really neat. Edith and Little bear raise a duck. Mr. Bear tries to educate them a little so they are good parents. Little bear comes up with some great ideas on how to teach it to swim. Kids can see how ducks are born to be ducks. The end is sad though, as the duck flies away while Edith is in tears. Just a dose of reality. The lesson to let things go, I guess.Honestly though, I was upset that Edith and Little Bear sat by the nest all day. If you do that the mother will not come back! They were essentially thieves. I could only think....that poor mother duck is probably in the bushes waiting for the doll and bear to leave. Mr Bear didn't think to say that the mother duck would not return, if they were sitting there guarding the nest. This is a better lesson kids should be taught."
3,"I like ""Rabid Nun Infects Entire Convent"" better.","It's by a guy who wrote stories from an even more over-the-top tabloid, the Sun. It just came out a few days ago."
5,A witty & wise memoir,"I loved this book! Sue Shapiro's voice is wry & witty, and I didn't want to say goodbye to her when I turned the final page. This is a memoir that reads like a novel. I just adore the protagonist, smart and honest and, in her flaws, a mirror for us all.A perfect book."
4,Delicious book.,I love this book.This book is useful to understand movements of view camera support by very good pictures explained.I'm thinkink that it's a must for anybody interessed by view camera techniques.
4,Basic training book,"In my opinion this book gives you a basic training of view camera. In particular it explains very well all view camera movements, but I would have preferred if there had been more details in those explanations, with more examples and other. Another point that I would have preferred different was the sequence of the chapters. In firsts chapters where is explained camera structure, accessory and other, there are too many reference at camera movements, that you haven't known yet, because chapter of movements is after.Anyway, this book, is well written and easy comprehensible, but in my opinion in some parts is too condensed; so my rate is 4 stars."
3,not exactly what I was expecting,"I had seen this item in a psychologist's office and only read a few of the daily pages. I liked the wisdom and helpful affirmations. However, I did not realized how much of the contents was religously refereneced and used as the foundation or grounds for supporting the validity of the statements. I preferred a non-secular publication without religious references."
2,wasn't very inspiring.,"I have read several of Marianne Williamson's books and really like what she has to say,so I thought this might give me a bit of inspiration each day. It didn't."
5,This book has helped many pass the TSE,This book has helped many pass the TSE. It has many valuable suggestions. The test is very hard to pass and this book is priced very reasonably.
2,Too much history. Where's the advice?,"I learned more than I wanted to about Melody's abused childhood and her life as a junkie. She goes into great detail about the crimes she committed and the miserable effects of her addiction. After painting such strong, striking, emotion-filled pictures time after time I expected her to draw some conclusions and parallels that I could use. No such luck. This is a long, tiring autobiography of a painful life, not a source for new elightenment."
2,Bringing Up Old Wounds,"Having benifited so much from Codependents No More, I had expected this book to bring that understanding along even further. Instead, I found that this book was really a recollection from the author's past and a retelling of stories that she has heard. Melody Beattie tells of her abusive childhood and addict days without the context of how those events transformed and led her to her later ground-breaking work on relationships. Thus her stories end up sounding like a confession of old wounds -- making the reader feel like a voyeur instead of a fellow voyager on a quest. I wondered if this book would have been praised as much if it were not written by the same author as Codependents."
4,Inspiring Real-life Story,It is amazing to read Melody Beattie's life story of her battle with addiction and destructive behaviors. She leads by example showing what she did to overcome her problems. I was truely amazed by what she went through. This is a wonderful Real life story for anyone struggling with addictions to read.
2,no surprising,"The templates don't cover what I am working. And I don't think that's perfect description for a my cover letter.Anyway, a good trial with a bit cost."
5,A Must Have For Anyone Needing Sales Letters!,"I have bought and purchased every product I could find to create or help me to create sales letters. Yanik's product makes the process of creating sales letters simple for the average person. Using his Instant Sales Letters, you really create a sales letter for your product, service, or opportunity in no time at all. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you add Instant Sales Letters to your marketing arsenal."
4,Dap Window Sealant,"Works great on my mental windows to seal small openings, but not so good for wood or big openings (well this model/brand for metal not wood anyway nor for bigger openings, say no more than 1 inch gap) it doesnt expand much so it's good if you have heavy hands and tend to press hard on the spray.LOLone DAP tex plus you can probably do up to 10 windows at least, easy for anyone to use and after i'm done looks like it was done by a pro window tech or something well sort off LOL"
1,WARNING: Does not come with straw,"I purchased one of these cans a few weeks ago, and the can did not come with a straw, despite the instructions telling you to put the straw in the nozzle and all pictures on the can showing this mythical straw.I tried a number of straws from various other products, but all of them were too large or too small to work with the nozzle of this product.I surely thought that this was a mistake and the straw had simply fallen off before shipping. There's even tape on the can where it seems like a straw would normally be placed, so I purchased another can recently in the hope of using that straw for both.When that can arrived, it too had no sign of the legendary straw.Now my only solution is to attempt to find replacement straws online, quite a hassle to go through to get a tiny piece of plastic.I have a nagging feeling that the people who are reviewing this product bought it in a store and not off Amazon, because the thing I received is totally useless."
2,Easy cleanup. Nothing else good about it.,"This stuff is runny and doesn't work well on anything but a crevice where you can spray from above. I tried to use it on a crevice right in front of me, and it went into the crevice and then a lot of it ran out, making a big mess.Tried to spray 45 deg upward into a crevice and it was even worse, making far more mess than actually filling the very small gap.I have considered returning it, but will keep it around for applications where I will spray downward and it cannot run out and make a mess.It doesn't foam consistently and doesn't seem to expand at all.It does clean up easily, though. That is its only plus feature. At least if you have hot water on the job, which is seldom the case in construction. Cold water cleanup is not nearly as good.I will not buy any more. Great Stuff has been my choice in the past and will continue to be my first choice."
4,"Good product, good price, one minor ""gotcha""...","These lights work great and are a great price. However, with this many lights, it really should come with a higher voltage power pack and more cable. To keep the lights spread out at a decent distance from each other, I wound up adding an additional 100 feet of cable. After adding that, they were too dim. So I had to purchase a second power pack and split the load up. Of course, I was using them as a lawn perimeter. I suppose if you were placing them as just pathway lights, having each light only a few feet apart would work. I've just never been fond of the lights placed that close together."
1,Do not buy these lights at ANY price - do not accept as a gift,I bought these lights and opened the box to find that the entire set had to be assembled from cheap plastic pieces. You have to wire the lights...everything!!! The instructions are dismal. The last time I experienced something this awful was once when I bought a hibachi grill back in the 70's that had to be assembled. It took us 3 hours to figure out the instructions and assemble this set of lights. This product comes under the heading of 'Things that should never have been allowed to be manufactured'.
5,very helpful for me as a high schooler with ADD,"I recently read Help for ADD at High School by Kathleen Nadeau. There were many pieces of advice that were new to me and other things that my parents and tutors had taught me before. The advice that I had heard before, I have used during my years in high school. These simple tips are how I survived and passed every single one of my classes. I could tell that when Dr. Nadeau wrote this book, she understood the people who would be reading it. Usually when I read information books, I get bored and distracted easily. This probably has alot to do with my ADD. Dr. Nadeau remembered that the reader of this book, like myself, probably has ADD. In writing the book, she made a special effort to make sure I didn't loose interest. The content of the book helps students to understand their obstacles and teaches them how to overcome them. I would recomend this book to any high schooler who has ADD, it will truly help you through your difficulties."
5,Very informative and insightful for teens with ADD,"This book was very helpful to both me and my teen. The information is presented in a very clear, teen-friendly and organized manner that's easy to read. It made me aware of what issues I should be discussing with my teen with ADD and gave me suggestions I can make that are helpful. This book also gave my teen insight into typical struggles and solutions that he's dealing with as a result of living with ADD. From basic information about how to know if you have ADD to social and school issues, this book covers all areas of concern in a user-friendly, straightforward and practical manner."
1,Not that much Information,"I was looking for a book how to deal with teachers that are uneducated about ADD, my son has it and they just want to classify him as mentally retarted. I need more info.This book is more for the child than a parent"
5,Elegant and reliable!,"This watch is stunning - very classic, simple design. The craftsmanship is superb - details such as the clasp, the inscription on the back of the watch, the strap, the packaging... all excellent quality and truly the product of a proud watch maker. I absolutely love the way it looks and I love the price - I mean, for this level of quality and aesthetic sense, this is a bargain!! I am shopping for another Stuhrling as we speak because at this price, I can afford multiple beautiful watches. And, I was particularly impressed with the video on the Stuhrling web site that demonstrates how to work the clasp. It not only helped me quickly figure out how to do it, but I was impressed that the president of the company is the one doing the demo. Again, a testament to the pride that he takes in his brand and product."
5,rose gold watch/Sturling,"Very pleased with this watch, since it is quite classic and quite readable, plus is in rose gold tone, my first requirement. Keeps time perfectly so far , and has encouraged me to seek others of this brand."
3,Would not pay the RetailPrice Published,Good thing I bought this watch for 70% off because it is not worth what the listed Retail Price was.
1,Watch out,"Item name ""Stuhrling Original Women's 145L.1245E2 Classique 'Gatsby' Swiss Quartz Watch"" implies this watch is Swiss made. It is actually not. Five-star reviews (there are a lot of them) are likely biased by Manufacturer's promise to extend warranty for one year for ""spreading a good word on Amazon"". Band and clasp are uncomfortable and cumbersome to use.After realizing that a really good product would not need this type of advertising and induced customer's reviews, I sent the watch back. And Amazon (are you listening?) should know better than this!"
4,love it,"I really like this watch, and get many compliments from friends and family. In fact, one friend likes it so much she has now purchased exactly the same! The only thing I miss, and which my previous Rodania watch did have, is a date indication. But I am getting used to being without. Great quality watch and for a good price !"
3,Watch face and band is fairly large,I bought this watch but recently returned it because it is too large for a small-boned person. It is a beautiful watch and perfect for someone who does not have a small wrist. You also can not tell from the photo that it is rose gold so that was a surprise to me.
5,AWESOMEly handsome,This watch is a steal. BeaUtiful architecture. BeaUtiful workings. UnbeliEvable cost. BUY THIS WATCH!The packaging is very sharp ... but the watch is so gorgeous. You'll love wearing it!
4,Good quality watch,This is a well made watch and a great price. I may order more as Christmas gifts. The clasp is difficult but OK after you get used to it.
5,impressive for the money,I have to say that I am extremely impressed with the quality of this watch. The clasp is great quality and styled like watches costing thousands of dollars. The finish is even and the movement is accurate. I will order one in black also. This was a very good buy.
2,PVC outgassing,"I can't really review how this cushion functions because I can't get past the horrible PVC smell. It's incredibly strong. I put a bathroom mat on top of the cushion to try to cut down on the smell, and also because the smell was transferring to the seat of my pants so that I could still smell the cushion even when I wasn't near it! I was, in essence, wearing the cushion! I might give this cushion away. Hopefully the company will come up with a better, less toxic and less toxic-smelling material to make this from. I think the cushion is a good idea, and if it's supposed to be health-promoting, it should be healthy for us in *all* aspects, including the material it's made from."
4,nice freezer,"My only real complaint about this deep freeze is that it arrived dented on the top. Sometimes it hinders the lid from shutting properly. Make sure you inspect it before the delivery people leave! Otherwise, I like the design and size of this deep freezer."
4,The Loves of Carmen,The movie is a great showcase of Miss. Hayworth talent for her dancing and acting ability. The chemistry of Ford and Hayworth is fantastic. Great photography and in color the beauty of Miss Hayworth is worth the price of the DVD.
5,The Loves of Carmen 1948,"Rita Heyworth (1918-1987) & Glenn Ford (1916-2006 ) a superb pair in a marvelous story . The movie are full of temprament and passion , nobody could it play better than Rita , this marverlouse women . They are vibrant and volatile as impassioned lovers in this Romantic drama of Desire and revenge . Set in 18th-century Spain , this beautiful gypsy girl and respectable dragoon soldier ignite the screen with a love affair you?ll never forget ! . Do you need a better recommendation ! . Transfer in High resulution with superb shar and clear pictures . Truly Recommended ! Pure Hollywood nostalgic movie"
4,Minds of Birds is a must read for the avian enthusiast!,I have often wondered about motivation for certain actions and reactions of my pet birds...this book has filled in the blanks..The author studied birds for over 60 years and has given a wonderful record of all types of situations and a basis for understanding the instinctual and functional behaviors necessary for survival. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves and keeps birds..
5,"very honest seller, highly recommended","very honest sellerhighly recommendedwould buy from this seller, again, no questions asked"
1,sucks,"did not work on the PS3, do not buy. all it did was freeze up after the home screen, when you select the game."
2,"uninspired, though it has its moments.","Legend of Lemnear has amazing graphical quality despite its age. Too bad that this 45 minute ""movie"" has bad dubbing, not much of a plot, and shallow characters. But, it's done by Satoshi Urushihara, so you can except some really detailed visuals and a good deal of nudity. The theme song is also good, as is the background music, although it tends to drop in and out of tune every ten seconds or so. I don't know if it's just my copy. The last fight against Veroll and his four (!) forms was actually pretty cool, and had a sweet background song to it, audio problems aside. But as it stands, it's too short. There's not much of a plot to it, but the animation was definitely its main point. A decent rent."
1,Get Something Else,"Too much rape/abuse, virtually no character development, and a ridiculously simple ending. If you must watch it, listen to the cool music at the beginning, then fast forward to when she's running up the staircase, ignoring the numerous disquieting rape/abuse scenes. The fighting at the end is amusing. Then, take note of the mindbogglingly silly ending. Then, throw it away.If you really liked the part in Return of the Jedi when Jabba was abusing the slaves, you'll get a kick out of this anime; it takes up about 1/4 of the actual playing time. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,horrible,"This is one of the worst anime I've seen. Pass on this one. Bad guys that look like idiots and go 'duhhh,..hey bosss,.duhh', and a girl that walks around in a bikin and fights characters that remind of that liddie clssic,..rainbow bright, and walks around making annoying,..qushh, qushh sounds at every step, and has the voice and attitude of a cheerleader that smokes. We're definately a far ways away frm masterpiece theater here. This one stinks"
5,A superb vintage mystery,"Reviewing this book, the New York Times said ""From the first page to the last, this story is pervaded by the atmosphere of horror and suspense that invariably marks the work of Mignon G. Eberhart."" The Times had it right. There's plenty of horror and suspense in ""Death in the Fog,"" and plenty too of the atmosphere of the Depression-era screwball comedy; if Hollywood were casting this in 1933, the principal roles would have gone to Carole Lombard, William Powell, Gene Raymond, Marie Dressler, Helen Broderick, and Eric Blore. Anyone with a yen for that 30s atmosphere and with a fondness for Chicago will find ""Death in the Fog"" irresistible. Compared to ""The House on the Roof"" and ""Fair Warning,"" the pacing is better and the heroine more compelling; this may be Eberhart's best work from the 1930s."
2,Paper for beginners,"I recently purchased this book, and had considered (sorry Amazon)sending it back, since it wasn't at all what I'd been looking for. However, after Reading it through, and enjoying the Beautiful Illustrations I decided to keep it. As a practical guide, it is definately well suited for the person wanting to try their hand at paper making, and having no previous experianceat all. It is not a good guide for the intermediate paper maker, or for those looking for detailed information regarding the construction of paper making equipment, or the use of more advanced techniques. A good guide for beginning hobbyists...and a lovely, addition to the bookshelf."
4,"300 Papermaking Recipes, not what I was looking for but good none the less.","The authors discussed fabric dyes in papermaking as well as various types of natural and embedded inclusions/enhancements. Photo samples of papers made are well presented and clear. Well produced, but not what I was looking for."
1,Starr's Saving Grace,"On this book's behalf, I must say that I somewhat enjoyed Allison's poems. The ideas certainly had a degree of merit. However, the pretention in this book astounded me. Something about Allison's poetry seemed to not ring true. It looks to be an amateurish attempt by an obviously young writer to seem intellectually involved and astute. The gusto was apparent, but it was sadly misdirected. Starr's work was the saving grace of the book: enthralling and original."
4,A cryptozoological classic!,"This dated paperback is one of the finest texts on cryptozoology I've ever had the pleasure to read -- sadly, most of the dozen or so books on the subject are drivel that may as well have been regurgitated from the tabloids. Not so with this one. A number of ""mystery creatures"" are discussed at length and in detail. Sasquatch-type creatures make up about a third of the content, and the remainder covers such difficult to classify oddities as ""Mothman"" (and similar winged entities), the ""Jersey Devil"", and ""Phantom Cats & Dogs"" (which includes seance manifestations as well as the myriad types of black panther-type entities encountered throughout North America. Loren Coleman co-wrote this gem with Jerome Clark -- I've read several books by both individual authors, and this is probably the best of them all. There is an abundance of useful information to be found ""between the lines"" -- make the connections yourself. Check this one out!"
1,Misguided Guide Book,"For a reference book it is disappointing that this book sets forth so much misinformation and so many inaccurate facts. Although the work does not pretend to be neutral, the extent of the author's prejudices is disturbing. He has a nasty word for almost everyone reviewed, in the manner of a supercilious school-master. The entry for Schenker gives the wrong first name and completely misconstrues the nature of his work. The entry on Sessions is patently hostile, and characterizes the Second Sympony as 12-tone, which it is not. The book as a whole, entertaining as it may be, is woefully untrustworthy."
4,I little less exciting than the first,"I guess this goes to show, that just like in videogames and movies, comic crosssovers have their weak points. This proved it in the the return of the Predator to take out Batman. This time it's out for revenge. Meanwhile Batman has a bounty on his head and has attracted 7 of the worlds most dangerouse assassins to hunt him down. Meanwhile he also gets some unwanted help from the Huntress.The Predator however is not in the complete clear as two of it's kind are hunting it down. Eventually Batman, Huntress, and the Predator face off in a pretty good final boute. Overall thsi is for die hard fans of both series only."
4,Quite a good sequel,"Months after the events of the first crossover, another Predator from the galaxy has arrived in Gotham as it wants to take down the caped crusader as it has slaughtered a dozen assassins who in turn have been hunting for Batman. Batman with the help of Huntress are tracking down this new intergalactic menace who's out for revenge.An enjoyable follow-up to the amazing 1991 crossover of having Batman fighting the legendary 20th Century Fox alien monster, i should say this 1994 sequel is very good but not as excellent as the first one. I like how it features the ever sexy Huntress to join in the league to kill off the slaughterhouse from space and this one is quite violent too, the writing is decent but the artwork is very good."
1,Never lived up to interest,"Doug Moench is a good Batman writer but his work here is rather poor. Batman tussles with a Predator for the second time. Obviously, the story needs to be more interesting than a retread of the first one. The result is a hodge podge which doesn't quite work the way it should. The Huntress joins Batman in battling the Predator. As extra subplots, there are two other Predators out to stop the one hunting Batman and some kingpin wants Batman's head so he hires some of the nastiest mercenaries to do him in. The first subplot never lived to its potential and the second just drags the story."
4,this one won't open accidently,"The inlay is very colorful. This doesn't have a spring latch so there's no chance of it opening accidently in your purse. A little large for my daily use, but the extra room is nice for those occasions when I need it."
3,"Good story, woeful art","Elliot Ness (of Untouchables fame) investigates a series of VERY grisly murders. Bendis is a fine writer but the art is confusing and just no, just no."
4,Good Graphic Novel (bad production values),"I really enjoyed reading this book so didn't want give a poor rating based on that. However, the book itself literally fell apart. First the cover came off and then chunks of pages began falling out. Very disappointed since I really like the material itself."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover!,"I anticipated receiving this book because I was drawn to the photo on the cover - a flower represented in half photo, half quilt. I expected the quilts inside to be replicas of nature. Instead there are one or two like this and the rest are not ""garden-inspired"" at all, as far as I can tell. The first quilt is a basic log cabin quilt. The second is a folk heart type quilt. I was really hoping for more artistic, realistic quilts. The photos are so lovely... I wish the quilts compared!"
1,Junk,"Used it to replace an under cabinet fixture in my kitchen that burned out after 3 years (on 24/7). This one crapped out in less than a month, overheating I believe. I think GE must farm these out to a mfgr in Gibip or somewhere. Junk."
4,Exploitation as it should be,"A film that's not afraid of what it's trying to be. (Full) Nudity every 60 seconds or so. In your face dancing (shake that butt!). Silly, lighthearted yet sometimes funny jokes. Teenagers hitch-hiking and using their sexual abilities to pay their way. Unbelievable scenerios. Beautiful girls. Older lesbian coming on to them. Them coming onto every guy they meet. A few explicit scenes. Likeable characters/actresses. ""Let's write our hitch-hiking sign on our butts so we can moon the viewer (oh yeah, and the drivers) so they'll pick us up."" This is everything it claims to be and more.I need to start writing more reviews, because I'm sick of seeing bad reviews on Amazon for movies I find extremely entertaining.If you don't find this film enjoyable, then it makes me think you don't understand the title of the movie, and what the front cover of the DVD case represent. This isn't Oscars baby, this is EXPLOITATION!"
2,Teenage Pitchhikers,"This lacking hitch-hike movie has more twists and turns than the road to Beijing. The whole plot revolves around Sandra Peabody and Chris Jordan's bodies, thankfully they're bad actresses. Sandra Cassel (Peabody) was the most beautiful actress from the 1970's. She starred in Wes Craven's Last House on the Left and a few rare 70's cult/soft films. This silly/sexy grindhouse romp is among her worst. There are even hippies singing terrible folk-love songs.Honestly, the only reason to see this dated, rather predictable movie is to see lovely Sandra Peabody in various states of undress.If you can tolerate the 70's mentality and style of 70's hitch-hike exploitation movies, then the rest of the movie is about below average with a twisted surprise ending.Let's all hope, with baited breath that more of her films are not released."
2,Queen Anne Wood Folding Chair with Upholstered Seat,"Purchased these chairs from Amazon and I give them two stars because they are not worth the money they are charging, you can purchase the same brand Stakmore chair from WalMart for half the price Amazon is charging and if you are a member of Costco they are under $30.00 each,The chairs are not that comfortable to sit on. also I find lately Amazon prices are not any better than the local stores in my area."
1,Total Bitterness,The book and the author's websites are anti male. A man's feelings are poorly represented in the book (3 men and 9 woman describing the man's response in CHapter 4) and male access is denied on the website.Fortunately Ms Fleisher is no in need of federal funding.
1,Huge disappointment,"To read this book by a ""doctor"" is to be told that it's ok to cheat on your husband and that it's ok to cheat on a lesbian you might be using for a relationship on the side. This book is anti-feministic and almost cult like by those that read it and have written about it.There are no concrete plans that are helpful. Everything in this book is about giving more and more money to the author so she can basically tell you it's ok to cheat.If you want to hear it's ok to cheat, please read this book. If you are looking for a deeper answer to your own sexuality, why not look inside yourself and not go to someone who is clearly just interested in lining her pockets with your woes."
5,A MUST Read if you are bi/lesbian & married,"I picked up Joanne's book ""living two lives"" a few days ago. If you are still confused as hell and in pain - you NEED to read this book. It is amazing how ""on"" it is. 90% of what is said is so dead on accurate to what I am feeling - it is amazing.I am only about half way through it - but I can tell you - you will sit and read it with tears rolling down your cheeks. The truth is painful!My plan is to finish reading it - then get a highlighter and re-read it highlighting the most truthful/accurate parts to me, and then give it to my husband to read. I have not yet had the ""discussion"" with my husband - but I think this book is a wonderful window into what we are feeling and experiencing.GET IT!!!!!!! It is better than therapy :-)"
2,Not the best,This is very light weight and relatively compact. The hose leaves a lot to be desired. It's not very long and it's not as flexible as it should be. I've only had it 3 months and mine is already not acting right. Don't waste your money
2,For Airport Tarmac Use Only,"It's not all bad. This unit has good pickup, is very light, and also very inexpensive.It is also the loudest vacuum I have ever used! This thing ROARS! When I first turned it on, I thought something was wrong. Turns out the unit was operating normally, however. Now I check for my neighbors cars before I use it; if they're gone, I can use it. No early morning/late night clean ups with this device. I would not recommend this for apartment/condo dwellers at all.Too bad, too, because otherwise this is a pretty good vacuum for the money."
4,Life Science review,The Life Science text by Globe Fearon is excellent for the special education population. It is easy to read and expand on with extension excercises. The students enjoy the consistant reviews and explanations of difficult concepts.
1,bad luck the 1st time,"ok, so Jones sells it for about$3.00 less than my neighborhood music store... my daughter broke hers the 1st day she got it...I'm willing to try one more time & if it fails.. I say, damn you Jones as well!"
4,The Legend Continues.....,"The second single from the debut album ""Up All Night"". ""Every Single Day"" is a really much more better song than ""Ms Vanity"". But why did I only give it a 4 stars item instead of 5? It's because the second song on the single ""All Right Now"" disappointed me a little. I still think the version of ""All Right Now"" he performed in Australian Idol Season One in last year (2003)was much more better. But it's still good to see that he put this song up onto this single since this song was not available on his debut album ""Up All Night"". Now, the third song on the single, ""Dirty Girl"" was a really funky pop rock song. This is the remake version of ""Dirty Girl"" which was also available on the debut album. This single would still worth your money anywhere ;) And the fame of Millsy is still hot on air in Australia ;pP/S : Check out everything about Millsy at www.millsy.com.au"
3,Circle cutter,This Item is great if your just cutting paper or thin material and your not trying for exact placeent. It is also hard to read the scale on the cutter.If you need to cut paper board or thicker material ths is not the one to buy.
3,Interested in the CREE,The Pros are that is what it says it is but Cons are that it's quite limited in scope/coverage of the Cree populations.
3,Good reference book for collectors,"I began collecting Blenko glass shortly before I bought Ms. Pina's book earlier this year. I refer to it often when I am searching internet auctions. Initially it helped me determine whether a price was in line with the fair market value. Lately I have been using it to determine to my own satisfaction whether an unmarked piece truely is Blenko. The pictures are very good quality. The only drawback to the book is that is it woefully short on text. It would have been beneficial if the book contained some in depth discussion of Blenko craftmanship and how to distinguish their products from the other WV glassmakers, especially since they all had a tendancy to copy one another."
2,Try Averroes!,"Read ""Decisive Treatise and Epistle Dedicatory"" (Islamic Translation Series) by Averroes, instead!Averroes was less a mystic and more a rationalist. He greatly influenced Thomas Aquinas, and reportedly even influenced Maimonadies, both of who had an influence on Western thought.If you want to know of the irrationalism of today's Islam, Al Ghazali is a good start. Somewhere along the line, Averroes's rational approach lost out to Al Ghazali's mysticism, and today that makes all of the difference between Islam and the other two surviving Mediterranean-based religions."
5,Perfect Treat For Halloween!...,"If you love the old TALES FROM THE CRYPT TV shows, then you'll be delirious over BORDELLO OF BLOOD and DEMON KNIGHT! The Crypt Keeper is in rare form w/ classic intros full of blood, boobs, and cornball jokes. The two films are packed w/ vampire-hookers, a televagelist (played by Chris Sarandon from FRIGHT NIGHT and CHILD'S PLAY!), demons -including a devilish Billy Zane (CRITTERS, DEAD CALM, MEMORY, THE MAD)-, gore, and enough wall-to-wall nudity to keep any flesh-fan slap-happy! I wish they still made TFTC movies (no, I don't count RITUAL among them). The horror and humour are well-balanced, and the stories are interesting and different. Highly recommended..."
5,Great Double Feature,I bout this primarily for Demon Knight and it being a double feature was a bonus. Couldn't beat the price
4,Crypt Keeper,"Great Movies both on 1 DvD good deal. But demon Knights was the bomb. Full of fun, horror, and blood. The Crypt Keeper have you wanting more ."
5,Classic Fun,"I love Tales from the Crypt, and to have these two movies is a treat. I thought it was cool they came together like that, I couldn't be more satisfied. Thanks!"
1,Did not Work,I purchased this product to repair china and the putty failed to harden only remaining in a semi-hard state.Wasted my time and money
4,dries quickly and remains strong,Got this to plug up a water leak in a metal tube that is touching a plastic part. Applied it and it was dry quite quickly. Only gripe is that it dried almost too quickly! Tried to push it farther underneath a crack and it became a little too resistant. Had to scrape it out then restart.The patch worked great once I had it set right. Sealed up the leak and turned solid. Don't anticipate having to reapply again.
2,Didn't do the trick for me,"I tried to seal a leak in a garden tractor transmission casing and was recommended this product. I did all that was expected (cleaning, even roughed up the surface with a die grinder). The leak persisted and the only way I'll fix the problem is the weld the area with the crack. Dissappointed with the performance of this product."
5,Gingher Quality Can't Be Beat!,"These little scissors are just the right tool for nipping stray threads, tearing out mistakes, or doing delicate trimming work. Like other Gingher scissors, they are well worth the extra money you will pay for them. They have a much better hand-feel and smoother action than the less expensive scissors that are available. If you sew a lot or just want to have the best possible tools when you do, then you will not regret purchasing these scissors."
5,What Can I Say???...,"I first bought this album in 1982.I was 22 years old at the time, and a huge music fan. My musical tastesranged from rock to classical to pop and I was a big fan of ...Parliament!Bootsy was the bass player for the group and I immediately became a fan.""Stretching Out In A Rubberband"" was played til the grooves fell off.When ""The One Giveth..."" came out I was very excited. After one play, I became an even bigger fan of the guy. ""Land shark"", ""Countrackula"", ""Excon""...all classics.The album didn't get much play at the time, and I never understood it. It should rank along side Bootsy's best."
3,historical fiction,"This story, written by Munn, is one of her best I have read so far. It has good descriptions and puts the reader in the midst of the action of those times. A well researched write. If you like historical work, this one may interest you."
4,Great Scarf,I bought this scarf for my husband because I knew he wanted a closely knit (as opposed to hand knitted) scarf that would appear gentlemanly and elegant. He seemed very satisfied. A nice buy.
5,struck dumb..,"my wine in silence...this wasn,t composed by any living mortal...what abyss vomited it out i cannot imagine...you just gave it a name...rapture, a soothing lament for my soul.this album is so dark,lamenting,sorrowful...beautiful in its uniqueness...."
3,Not really a Madness fan,"I heard ""Elysium"" on Pandora, and loved the song. After a bit of a search, I found this album, and it was the cheapest way to get that song, plus one or two other songs I liked. ""Saturday Night Sunday Morning"" is a different style, but quite listenable. To me, the other songs were a mass of mediocre (or worse) electronic music from the late 1990s. But again, I'm just not a fan of the overall style of Madness, so anyone who likes this style should be quite happy with the album."
4,Family History Logbook,"Family History Logbook, A Timeline Journal from 1900 to 2000 is a excellent tool to use, going back through the dates and years of events that happened in your family. Author Reinhard Klein has also inclded a box for each year of historical events that happened in that particular year.It was fun to catalog ancestor's births, dates, and special events over the years. Beware, put down your family information and set time aside every week or so because as in all research, sometimes once you put it down and out of sight, it is hard to get back to it. The auther has set up a excellent program, easy to do and fun to do."
2,doesn't work after 3 months,"Swim regularly w/ it for 3 months, go to Hawaii and it stops. Yes, i did rinse thoroughly etc. So it's stuck w/ the daily alarm on and none of the buttons work. The blue parts of the band has also yellowed. Timex charges $7 to have anything fixed even under warranty, we'll see how that works.... good and bad reviews on amazon, i took a gamble and lost.update: so i got my watch back after a few weeks and it's still broken!!! the dial is fogged up after my first swim. I'm so disappointed. Don't bother with this crappy watch. 1star rating at best."
1,Code Enforcement A comprehensive approach,I wanted a more updated book. This is a rather old edition. Can I exchange this book for a more recent one?
1,Not Happy,Item showed up missing the remote. Emailed company and was told remote would be sent ASAP. Remote never arrived. Sent item back with letter requesting a refund. Have not heard from company yet. Wife was looking forward to some discreet fun. Not very happy!
3,A bit strange but mildly exciting album,"The last four tracks are mostly done in a different style which is probably not what most people expected then from AW but my guess is that the guys were still searching for their road. Besides that ""Farkus"" is short but pleasurable instrumental, ""You Could Have Been a Lady"" is just great; then follow ""Drop Your Guns"" and ""Bad Side of the Moon"" being rather generic but very listenable rockers. Again, the second half sounds like it was done by another band but that doesn't mean it's done badly - it is actually pretty good."
3,On record,"This is not April Wine's original line up. James (Jim)Clench was not part of the original April Wine 1st album (with Fast Train). This is the album where Myles Goodwyn becomes lead singer and song writer. Excellent cuts are could have been a lady (a staple at all live shows), Bad side of the moon (an Elton John song) and Drop your guns (boycotted song in the US 'cause of the Vietnam war). This is classic April WineEnjoy!!!"
1,terrific... for a few weeks,"i live on the phone as part of my work and have tried every Plantronics, Panasonic and other headset out there. This one had such great sound and it was so comfortable that I immediately ordered more for my extension phones. One died altogether, another has intermittent cut-out, and the last works but the mouthpiece separates from the ear piece, and there doesn't seem to be a way to tighten or adjust it."
2,the price is not the product,"i ""upgraded"" from the motorola h700 to the nx6000 after reading some of the other reviews. i had hoped that the positive comments would outweigh the negatives, but for me the experience has been mostly negative as well. the reception is a lot more staticky than the h700 (more people tell me now my voice is ""breaking"") and the two earloops they provide are equally uncomfortable. speaking of design flaws, using one button for all functions (except volume) is dumb; for example, it's easy to automatically redial when you're trying to power off (both are done by holding down rather than tapping the one button). on the positive side, i can walk a lot further from my phone and still get reception, but what good is the increased range if no one can understand you and you're constantly jamming the nx6000 in your ear to get it to stay put?"
2,"Great Incoming Sound, Poor Outgoing Quality","I really liked the small size and incoming sound quality. The incoming sound was one of the best I've ever heard in a headset. I would have overlooked the ear loop's habit of falling off and the relative discomfort of the earbuds, if not for the extremely poor outgoing sound quality. I was told quite often, and by different parties, that my voice sounded tinny and cuts off frequently. I've returned it for warranty repair/replacement. Hopefully, I won't have to resort to buying the bulky Jawbone..."
1,"Really, realy disappointed","I tried this at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas and waited over six months until they became available. It picks up wind noise from the air conditioner in the car, making it useless in summer.Worst, the thin little ear hanging thingy flops on your ear and wants to fall off. My partner had hers fall off while getting in the car, the door closed on it and when I contacted the Nxgen sales manager about the problem, no one ever took care of it.I expected a really great product, especially considering the price when compared to tons of units under $100, and this was a serious disappointment. I have one I don't use because it won't stay on my ear and one that was crushed. Avoid this like the plague."
5,Great,"despite what all has happened to Michael Vick, i still like having one of my favorite players sitting on my desk."
4,"How to draw the human figure:Famious Artist School, step-by-step method","I found this book to give me all I was looking for, how to draw gesture drawing,anatomical proportions,figure, and it gives you practice pages to draw on and then comparison pages to go back to so you can see your errors and correct them. this is a self teaching book that works"
3,NOT A BEGINNING,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK BUT NOT ONE FOR THE ""AVERAGE"" BASIC BEGINNER. WAS HOPING FOR A STEP BY STEP."
3,Plan Activity Clock,"I was sent two clocks, one to my daughters home and one to mine which I did not want. I am still waiting for reinbursement - it was mailed back on the day it was received, unopened."
2,For Beginners only,"This is basically a rehash of the CCCS party line - absolutely NOTHING new or original in here. NOTHING about debt negotiation - reducing the principal balance, the money actually owed, not just payments or interest rates. Easy to read, a fine primer for someone who knows nothing about this stuff and is in debt trouble for the first time, but useless to someone who is fighting for his financial life against debt collection lawyers."
5,Life Altering Reading,"Awesome!!! This is one of the most helpful and informative books I've ever written. I truly was beginning to believe that my debt was unmanageable. This author really provides great advice, based on hands-on experience, for dealing with credit issues. Easy reading. Thank goodness someone finally has explained all the pitfalls of credit usage in understandable terms. This is definitely must reading. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
3,A bit disappointing but an entertaining read,"I was initially very excited when I discovered the book, but it hasn't lived up fully to my expectations. The way I see it, it doesn't really do the show justice. It attempts to put all the events of 40+ years into a prose-styled, continuing chapter book that's 1000+ pages long (not the best style for a chronology). Although it details most of the plot, it has very little detail regarding character or setting. Nonetheless, it is not a bad read and the author should be commended for squishing nearly everything that's happened since the show started into one book."
5,Bosch Wire Set- Bosch Quality,"I purchased the Bosch 09485 Premium Spark Plug Wire Set on Amazon.com to replace ignition wires on my 2000 Audi A6 2.8L. Over the years, I have come to rely on Bosch products as reliable, high-quality replacements for OEM parts on the Audis I have owned over the last 24 years. This wire set did not disappoint- it was of expected high quality materials and fit exactly as the original wire set! The best part is that it was available over Amazon.com at the best pricing I could find on-line! I am very satisfied with the Bosch wire set and would definitely rely on Amazon.com when the time comes to replace it again!"
3,Maybe I need a change of book topics,"This is my fourth or fifth book in this series, and while I rated the others highly (in my mind). This one seemed a little harder to get into. I think there was a lil too much of the highland speech and that sometimes threw me off. Ye ken? Either that, or it just wasnae as interesting as the first ones I read. Although the next one with Artan sounds great!"
3,Not as good as earlier books in the series,"As a big Hannah Howell fan I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I found the book to be 'just ok' because the hero, Gregor, wasn't very likeable. He's not the strong alpha male that is typical for this series. I found him wishy washy, indecisive, and kind of boring.The part of the book I really enjoyed was catching up with characters from previous books in the series. Ewan and Fiona's story was one of my all-time favorites so that is why I gave this book 3 stars vs. only 2 stars."
5,Highland Lover,I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Hannah Howell work. She is a great author and you won't be disappointed.
3,just ok,"There are parts of this book that are definitely informative and interesting but I would not recommend it to anyone as a great read. I am definitely not invested in most of the characters as they took forever to develop. The book seems to skip around a bit and can be confusing especially if you don't care about the characters. It certainly starts with a good story and then somehow devolves into a sort of biography.I don't think this book is bad, but as a big fan of Hunter S. Thompson (I was not expecting his writing or even Gonzo but he did write a forward I think) this was a let down."
2,Not right size,Battery worked but did not fit snug like the original. Might have caused a guy issue when I had to push down harder the. I wanted to on the internal case and now I might have screwed up the click wheel. Not to happy
1,Misleading,"Dr. Caesar, an English major and American literature professor, purports to share her personal experiences in the Middle East. The problem is that throughout the book she continually makes sweeping statements with no factual back up. For example, she sticks in the statement ""I wonder if there was something of this in America's antagonism toward the Middle East"" in the middle of a story about touring Dendara. Apparently the author wants to be a political scientist without taking the time to do the research or study necessary for the conclusions she reaches. At the same time though she does share some personal experiences we virtually do not share at all in her courting and marriage to an Egyptian man. A very disappointing book that I would not bother reading."
5,good sturdy bag,This is a good heavy duty high quality bag. Carries many pounds of books. Comfortable on your shoulders great straps!
2,Not suitable for school,"This bag has a great quality, but is not suitable for school... because it is too big! Honestly, I believe the 4-inch-long part at the bottom is making it both ugly and big!"
5,Listen for the nuance,"Michael writes in something of a ""new age"" sound, but a careful listener will appreciate the delicate nuances and pleasant surprises of Michael's pieces. It is music that calms the soul in ways one does not expect."
5,A powerful classic from Mongo,"I first heard this not long after it was released and had it on vinyl. All this time later, this set holds up and reallyis a must have for anyone interested in Mongo's greatness. Extremely enjoyable and swinging."
2,"Buy ""ReJoyce"" Instead...","I bought this CD one day when I was getting gas at a 7 Eleven. They advertised this exclusive Jessica Simpson Christmas CD, only available for a limited time at 7 Eleven. Being a fan of Jessica, I bought it. I didn't know that she would be releasing an actual full Christmas album in stores just a few weeks later. When ReJoyce (her full holiday album) was released, I went to check it out. It has all of the tracks from this CD (with the exception of the ""Angels"" Acoustic Version), and several other tracks. In retrospect, I should have waited to buy the full album. If you're a collector, this CD is a great addition to your shelves...but if you're just a Jessica fan (or a Christmas music fan for that matter), spend the few extra dollars and get the full ReJoyce CD. Trust me, you're not missing much with the ""Angels"" Acoustic Version (which isn't even a Christmas song), and there are some great songs on ReJoyce that aren't included on this CD."
5,Only cause is jess!!!,"Maybe this album is not as good as rejoyce, but it's still great, I just love her!"
4,zorro by alex toth,Zorro by Alex Toth is a very fine publication containing more than 100 pages of Toths comics from the sixties for Walt Disney and Dell comics. His drawings are very fine not too detailed artwork and the stories are great fun. I miss the colors though but the drawings are very fine shadowed under supervision by Toth himself.Mik
5,Relationships between myths and legends and everyday life,"From rumors of a ghost in a Pizza Hut to a writer who claims abduction by aliens, Aliens, Ghosts And Cults gathers the relationships between myths and legends and everyday life, considering how these legends become a part of common culture. Often revolving around spiritual and social issues are tales which have become imbedded in our culture, Bill Ellis' Aliens, Ghosts And Cults provides an excellent, highly readable cultural analysis."
5,Great show,This show is hilarious and neat and I recommend it to my friends for how funny it is; it is great to watch.
3,Funny Episode!,"Picture quality was not that great! Its nice that Amazon has this titles for viewing, but the picture quality needs improvement, since its worse than your grandparents TV."
3,perfection is most likely not,this title is far out to perfection repair or furthermore ajdusting is likely rewritting is most desirable and extremely of importance but meanwhile david sklansky is a perfect buy book for all players he has over a dozen of titles for all your needs is a must buy david is the way to go
2,High-Low-Split Poker For Advanced Players,"The Omaha Eight or Better Section of this book is too basic. It lacks specific information on: post and preflop odds, table position, playing connectors, playing turn and river, percent of counterfeit occurances, drawing odds, pot odds and other valuable information that would be of interest to a serious player with a desire to improve their game. Very disappointing."
1,High-Low-Split Poker...,"My main interest in buying this book was for information on Omaha high-low and overall I found this to be very disappointing. First, since the book is split between stud and omaha, I had little interest in the stud portion. Second, the information on Omaha was of a very general nature and not nearly as in-depth and specific as the Hold Em for Advanced Players by Sklansky. Why Omaha high-low didn't get its own book is beyond me, is it because the author just doesn't have that much strategy to share? That was my feeling and I ended up selling my copy through amazon marketplace. I've found more useful information on Omaha strategy at online websites than in this book."
1,bleh......,"After reading the other books from Two Plus Two publishing by Sklansky & Malmuth, I was let down by this offering. I play both Stud 8/b and Omaha 8/b and I can't really say that this book helped me at all. Anyone who's logged any time at the tables knows the basics of live cards in Stud 8/b and drawing to the nuts in O8B. What I found especially irritating was the deceptive size of the book. Zee goes through the teaching sections and then says the EXACT same thing in the ""Questions and Answers"" section, giving the EXACT same answers. Considering how few good books there are on the subject of high-low poker, I thought surely an offering from Two Plus Two would be the definitive authority, but alas, buy this book and you'll be disappointed."
4,Two books for the price of one! But only one good book.,"The Stud Hi/Lo split section is very specific, and very enlightening. It is definitely a section that I would not want my opponents to read. Many specific situations are covered, and the logic behind the actions he recommends is clear. It's clearly superior to any advice I've previously read on the topic.The Omaha section is only okay. The Super/System 2 section is better, and ""Winning Omaha 8 or Better"" by Mark Tenner is best. Ray Zee seems to just kind of pull percentages out of thin air when discussing Omaha/8 strategy (one section discussing redraws is just ridiculous), and kind of falls into the trap that pre-flop raising is just silly in O8. However, the advice isn't as fallacious as some that I've seen on the internet (i.e. Full Tilt's ridiculous propagation of Matusow's ""live high cards"" blunder)Overall, totally worth the time, especially if you don't feel like tracking down a separate book on O8."
4,"Great for Learning, Fuzzy in Spots","After a local tournament I had played in, I noticed a cash game started playing Omaha Hi/Lo. Naturally I played and had little success, barely managing to break even. I knew there was a way to beat this game so I ordered the book. Ray lays out a great basic strategy with tips for when to get in multi-way pots, when to play certain hands, etc. However, on the re-read, I found that a lot of the information was fuzzy; that is, it wasn't nearly specific or in-depth enough to carry you past the beginner or lower-intermediate level. The ""For Advanced Players"" tag is slightly misleading in that respect. However, it's a great book to get started."
2,Not the best in space,Kinda disappointed in this Space Pen.I own several space pens and got this one for what I thought would be good functionality.Big Problem----NO CAP Storage.You must carabiner this or lanyard it to you to keep the cap handyor put it down when writing and hope it doesn't roll away.I quickly went back to my Bullet Space Pen.This one collects dust in my car for dire needs only.
5,May be the best investment I ever made.,"I love, love, love, love this pen.My uses aren't crazy. I'm just a student and creative writer who likes having a pen around. I also have a habit of losing pens like crazy, and used to go through about five or six pens per month. That meant I could only use the cheap stuff. Now I have this pen with me at all times, and it's comfortable, high quality, and has come in useful more often than just about anything else on my person. I use it multiple times per day.For the last several months, this has been the only pen I needed. It is one of my best friends."
2,very overpriced,"This book is quite overrated, also I think that it's extremely overpriced, the personal stories are very short, I was disappointed after reading this book."
2,There is better.,"This is at most a general introduction to schizophrenia. As one who has the disease, I expected a more intelligent discussion on the topic. Instead, the book is a dumbed down version of material available elsewhere. In fact, the book seems most appropriate for children and young teens who need an introduction on the subject. The only positive feedback I can give is that quite a bit of it is funny. I suggest reading the first chapter, then moving on to something better; for example, Me, Myself, and Them: A Firsthand Account of One Young Person's Experience with Schizophrenia (Adolescent Mental Health Initiative) (Paperback). This book covers the same material but in a more interesting and intelligent manner."
3,torture torture torture,"good story idea, but this book is mostly about different ways to torture a person. definitely needs more character development."
5,Really enjoyed the book!,I bought this book to read on vacation. I really enjoyed this 2nd book in the series by this author.I did not want to put it down. He did not dissapoint me.I look foprward to reading more of Jay's books.
3,Cute but not too cuddly!,I bought this cat for my daughter as it looks just like our Persian kitty. It's okay but not too soft; feels quite corse actually. I think it's a bit overpriced as well...
1,Don't buy this faucet,"The faucet itself isn't so bad. The problem is that no one makes replacement values or cartridges for this faucet. In two years when the value begins to leak, you will be force to replace the entire faucet as there are no replacement cartridges available for this unit.There ought to be a law against the sale of such merchandise for which replacement parts are not made."
3,Too subtle for me,I'm a big fan of Stash teas but this one doesn't do it for me. It's not objectionable -- more like forgettable. Just not enough oomph (consider that I am a coffee drinker for half of the day -- dark roasts.)
5,Fante will find his way into the classroom,"Cooper is an elegant writer in his own right. He brings new light to Fante's life and work. After reading his stimulating biography, any readers unfamiliar with Fante will immediately be drawn to his novels and readers already familiar with Fante will get the urge to re-read and re-think an author who, with the help of Cooper, will eventually find his way into the classroom."
1,Cat does not interact!,I bought this toy for my daughter who was SO excited to see the cat interact with the movie. The cat does not interact witht the movie at all and barely interacts with the cd included. Not worth the money at all!!
2,interactive sarafina plush cat,"This cat is fun because it talks to you, but you need the barbie movie for it to be more fun. It is pretty durable, but since it has batteries you can't do certain things with it. It is not educational. This toy is fun because it knows when certain parts of the movie are coming."
2,I was not impressed.,My daughter bugged me to tears for months for Serafina. I finally bought her and the dvd. The doll interacts a little with the cd but did nothing when we tried her out on the dvd. My daughter grew bored with it within a couple of weeks and now Serafina sits on top of the dresser collecting dust. I paid $40.00 for this useless toy. Serafina uses up batteries like a starving kitty. I do not recommend this toy at all.
3,daughter is crazy about it but mom is not,"We got this for our daughter's 6th birthday. I think it is quite ugly, but she is in love with it. It does interact with the movie, but it would be nice if it did it more. It is not really much to play with unless the movie is running. The movie (sold separately) is pretty good, even if I don't like Barbie."
5,Beautiful Fun Entertaining Serafina,I just purchased this beautiful kitty for my almost 3 yr. old daughter who is obsessed with the Princess and the Pauper movie and toys. She LOVES this kitty. She talks and purrs when you rub her and push her paw. She interacts perfectly with our VHS tape of the movie. The key to it working is to have a fresh battery and put the jewelry box in front of the tv (as close as possible not necessarily in front of the VCR as we originally thought). Now she works perfectly. She is well worth $19.99 to keep your child entertained and their imagination growing. The CD story is wonderful also. She will be a beautiful addition to any child's room. Don't delay..buy it today.
3,"Great toy for $20.00, but I wouldn't pay more","I bought Serafina for my 6 year old daughter at a Wal-Mart store for $19.88 (the website says $27.88). At $20.00, I can say that it was a good buy. Some stores are charging $30 or $40 and I wouldn't recommend paying that much for it.Pros: Moves, talks, and purrs when you interact with it. Works alone or with the included CD and the movie.Cons: It sounds a little too mechanical when it moves and the sounds are a little on the loud side. It sheds white fur a little when brushed and it sounds demonic when the batteries are almost dead.Overall, I would say that it's worth $20, but I would say they could have made the mechanics run more silently."
3,Sweet Toy - but so expensive,Serafina was my daughter's #1 item on her Chrismas list but she only cuddles with it once in awhile & spends most of her time playing with the Barbies from Princess & the Pauper. I just don't think it's worth the $ - but she would've been so disappointed if she didn't get it.
2,"Earth to Mattel, Serafina is about to go into orbit!","We are on our second Serafina. You guessed it, this one doesn't respond to anything either! Put 5000 batteries in it and the little gold box. Tried every CD/DVD, radio, TV, computer known to man and still nothing!Judging from these reviews, we are not the only ones to get bad product from Mattel. We will respond in kind by not purchasing any more product from this company.Hello? Anyone ever hear of quality control? If I can do it without crushing my daughter, this one is going back for a full refund.Another parent bites the dust."
2,Got it for $12.00 clearence in TRU,says very little. I predict the novelty will wear off in less than a week. A quality stuffed animal would get more use. DO NOT BUY.
2,It's OK....,"My daughter really wanted this and was talking for months about her dream was getting Sarafina for her birthday. When I saw it about 2 motnhs ago fo 9.95, I jumped on it. Her birthday was last week and here is what I think....It is ok. The cat is cute and has a pretty face and is fluffy. Although it says it comes with batteries the manual refers to them as demo and suggests changing them. Before I changed them, it sounded like Sarafina had too many beers. She does what she is supposed to but sounds like Robo-Cat. Her tail moves with a mechanical sounding and her head turns in a creepy way - keep expecting it to spin around. Her vocabulary is limited and considereing technology is unimpressive Overall...it is ok. No way worth full price but worth 10. Final word...I am glad i got it since it made my daughter happy but I just expected more."
3,Daughter loves it!,"My 5 1/2 year old daughter went on and on and on about wanting this item for Christmas. So, her Grandma and Grandpa bought it for her. She was THRILLED!!! She absolutley LOVES this cat. She pets her, carries her around, and combs her fur. My daughter LOVES watching the ""Princess and the Pauper"" DVD with Serafina. It does run through quite a few batteries, but even when the batteries have died, my daughter STILL plays/interacts with her. This is one of her favorite toys!"
5,Adorable!,"My daughter just received this for her 3rd birthday and it has not left her side for the past week! Serafina is adorable with long eyelashes and is so soft. You can press her paw or pet her back for various phrases, purring, etc. My 4 1/2 year old son is very upset that they don't have an interactive ""Wolfie"" - the dog from the movie. Not sure what to say when he told me Santa would probably have his elves make it for him - yikes!"
5,serafina is a huge hit,"My 7 year old daughter is head over heels in love with her Serafina cat. She takes her everywhere. Serafina is much easier to operate than her ""cousin"" GoGo My Walking Pup. You don't have to know elaborate secret codes (to make GoGo walk forward you pat head, stroke side twice, etc.). My daughter has had Serafina for a couple months now and still isn't tired of her."
3,"It was ok, for a day...","My daughter loves The Princess and the Pauper, but interestingly enough, would rather have a WOLFIE version of this toy. That's just her.I was expecting more interaction with the Serafina Plush Cat throughout the movie. She doesn't say that much. I've also found out by accident that Serafina will interact with ANY DVD I have in.One writer said that after the batteries run down, the toy sounds possessed, which is true and it's hilarious. That's probably the best thing about this toy. My daughter (age 4) was frustrated with it because she too was expecting it to talk more with the movie."
4,overall satisfied,"We had to order this twice. The first time we got it, it did not interact with the DVD, so we exchanged it. The second one, worked and is really cute. My daughter who is 6 enjoys playing with it, and seeing it interact with the DVD."
2,"Nice Idea, but could not keep my kid engaged","With all the rest of Xmas hype around, this present was started and left aside after 10 mins. Nice idea, interesting set up - just not compelling enough for a 7 year old."
2,Disappointing Gift from Santa,This was a gift for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. The cat only works in the manual mode - pushing the paw. The cat does not respond to the CD or DVD. We have tried 2 radios and the TV with no luck. All parts have new batteries and still nothing. We even returned one Serafina and got another but it still doesn't work. Mattel has been of no assistance because the web site is worthless and you get disconnected on the 800 number. It is ashame to pay this much and the toy doesn't work.
1,Disappointed,"My 4-year-old daughter really likes Serafina just to play with but I just tried it out with the movie and am extremely disappointed. I did get it to respond a little to the movie, but I am unhappy with the ""jewelry box"" that sends the signals to the cat. Within a half hour into the movie, it had drained two 9-V batteries. How ridiculous! I will be calling Matel in the morning to say how pathetic I think the product is compared to how it is portrayed on the box and in advertisements. My daughter could care less. She doesn't realize that it isn't working right, but I think it should be cheaper and not portrayed to do the ""extra"" functions."
3,Hidden Screw MUST Be Removed In Order For It To Work!!,"I have seen a handful of reviews on this kitty saying it didn't work, blah blah blah. Well we went through the same thing, I thought "" what a waste of money!"" Well we figured it out about a week after Christmas why it didn't work after changing the batteries 10 times. In the battery compartment of the jewelry box there is a little screw pretty much taking up space. You MUST remove this screw if you want Serephina to work. We did and now she works like a charm. I hope this helps somebody!! This toy definately needs to include those instructions."
2,Not worth the money,"My daughter received this toy for her her birthday, a full month before the movie came out. It never iteracted with the CD (new batteries were put in), and it has never worked with the movie. My daughter still loves to play with the cat, but quite a disappointment that it never interacted."
2,She doesn't sing!,"My daughter, a cat fanatic, had been waiting to get this for Christmas and I will be on the phone with Mattel tomorrow morning. In all the advertisements AND on the box it says she SINGS with the movie. On the Mattel website it says she also sings with the included CD. Well, she interacts ok, but there is no singing and we've been thru the entire movie twice and CD 6 times. This made my daughter cry on Christmas Day, she had been waiting to hear Serafina's singing voice. Next year, I'll be opening and testing well before the holidays!"
1,Didn't work right out of the box!,"I bought this cat for my daughter after much anticipation and we were very dissappointed! Most of the cat's phrases are garbled and makes her sound demonized! We thought it was the batteries at first so we put new ones in but it still didn't work! FRUSTRATION! The cat could be soooo cute if it actually worked properly! The wiring is obviously not in right and it is too hard to get at with the huge battery pack in the way. Overall,I believe it could have been a great toy so buy one and pray that yours works. If it doesn't, return it."
2,If they had a cheaper plush doll it would be worth it,"Does it talk at all during the movie, maybe but if you blink you might miss it. A cheaper plush doll would have been worth my daughter carring around and sleeping with. It's not worth paying for the interactive side of this toy. I have only heard around 5 phrases from this cat and I am not impressed. I will check into toys next toy craze."
1,Kitty cat,"My sister wanted the Serafina Plush Cat for Christmas but my sister is all about the brains so when she opened it and tried it out, she through it out and said,'This cat does not teach me anything."
2,For real beginners,"Read this book if you have never worked on a project, seen a project or talked about a project with anyone. This is a very basic book and also a very slow one. There are some interesting information around a lot of irrelevant explanations or general knowledge, such as: ""You need to be organized, for example, if you are not organized you may lose your keys and waste time looking form them, so you don't want to lose you keys, and that is why you need to be organized"" or ""Written communication is usually more formal than verval communication, with the exception of some e-mail""."
5,This girl is bad!!!!,I purchase this CD last year after I heard a sample of one of her songs and I keep checking her website to see when she is coming out with another one. It is a rare occasion where I like every song on the CD I didn't think it was possible Choklate proved me wrong. This girl is bad this is the type of music you vibe to. Love it 5 stars all the way!!!
4,"If you like hard core techno, this is the cd for you","It is hard to find a compelation cd with the hardest, loudest, hard core techno, until now. If you like hard thumping bass, this is the cd for you. The best thing is that not only do you get one whole cd full of differnt artists, but then you get an another cd with two outstanding dj mixes of hard core. This is a must have for the hard core fans. If you like this, check out Delta 9, Disco Inferno."
3,Old book with old ideas. Okay.,"This is an old book with old ideas. It's okay as far as old miniature books go, but there are lots of better books out there to look at: mini books by Helen Ruthberg come to mind for one; newer and old books by Jean Nesbitt for another.There are lots of ideas and black and white photos to inspire, but none that you haven't seen anywhere else. Compared with other books on miniatures out there, this one comes in at last. There's nothing new in it. If you want to see it, check it out of the library and then decided for yourself."
5,eye vitamins,"these bausch&lomb PRESERVISION AREDS vitamins have really worked for me. My doctor said I have the beginning stages of macular degeneration ie (getting older).Wearing good sun glasses as I do helps, these jels two times a day work too. I haven't needed to upgrade my glasses in three years which she say's is remarkable, we believe it's the vitamins, a little pricey, but, it's only your eyes we're talking about!!!"
1,Reputable Company But Common Combination of Vitamins,"This is a quality company and no doubt they use quality ingredients, but for such a high price, the vitamins were of the common variety which can be purchased separately for a lot less. So why pay the high price unless you want it all in one pill. My view: I like the one pill idea but not for hundrends of percent over the cost of multiple pills."
5,Happy Husband!,"My husband wanted to have an authentic helmet for his 50th birthday. He selected it, but I ordered it. The shipping was prompt, and it was packaged well.The helmet itself was of excellent quality. My husband was thrilled!"
4,Don't miss this one!,I loved this book! It shows us that African American women can fall love without all the angst that is usually associated with us. Steven sounds like the kind of man that is the star of a lot of women's fantasies. Anna Larence should keep up the good work. I am looking forward to more of her books!!!
5,Hawthorne Rocks,"This is a well written and well acted series. This is the beginning of the third season and sometimes that's the point in which a series starts to get stale. Not so with this particular series. This episode re-introduces you to Nick Renata, who was a recurring role last season. He is obviously still in love with Christina, but willing to step aside for her happiness.This episode is fraught with love, friendships, danger, and on the edge of your seat drama. Don't miss this innovative and thrilling drama."
3,Seasons 1 and 2 were great!!,"Season 3 not so much.The story lines sort of fell apart on this season. I likes some episodes but as a whole, not anywhere near the caliber of seasons 1 and 2."
4,We're All Human!!,"Not A Perfect Season (Especially since they cancelled the show... and left the audience hanging...)I love that the writers took a chance to show ""the human side"" of Christina.. Someone who has dealt with everything this character has dealt with - was bound to ""Crack"" - which caused her to do things that the audience wasn't accustomed to.We are human - We all have flaws..Some of the storylines this season were flat - but my Tuesday Nights hasn't been the same since they took HawthoRNe off the air.I wish the show was given an opportunity to grow or at least tie up the loose ends."
5,HawthoRNe: The Complete Final Season,"This was great! My daughter got me hooked on this series, and I know they have to make another series (because of the ending), even though this was the Complete final season."
4,Still going strong,"This is the same ""game"" brought out by Microsoft in May 2001. Microsoft discontinued further development before coming out with a newer version. They sold over 1.3 million copies and still have a strong following with huge amounts of free add-ons from individuals available on the Internet. It still runs on a relatively low-spec PC and goes for an unbeatable price. That said, if you want more capability and a product that continues to be developed, consider Trainz 2006. (It doesn't have to be one or the other. I use both.)"
4,Great Game with exceptions,"This is a good train simulator for a beginner engineer. I loved how you could just ride along as the game takes you along the route you have chosen. It gave me an idea as to how each engine is operated. The next feature I liked was the amount of actual trains you can choose from. There are at least 2-3 electric, diesel, and steam locomotives that you can drive. I was really impressed with the graphics that they offer. It needs some work, but it is a game that is meant for windows 95. So its an older game, so I didn't expect much, but I was surprised. I can't think of any better purchase for beginners. This is a good buy for sure. The only exception I can really think of is price, new it may not be worth it, not paying $100 for it, buy it used if you can. Also, the amount of add on's and the price they possess. This is why I recommend getting it used. There are so many add on's at $20 or more. So if you want more pay less for the game and more for the add on's."
2,Out of date,I didn't realize when I bought this game just how old it is. Graphically it's about on par with the original Half-Life. I was hoping for something that looked a little better.
2,Exploring Games,This game requires the CD in the drive in order to play run it.No wonder it was so cheap. Why have a large hard drive when you haveto keep the CD?
4,"Lacks simplified documentation, but is worth the time and effort","I bought this sim at the same time I bought MS's train sim, I immediately took a shine to this one, the visual sim is great and it gives you an easy ride and run interface. It lacks clear and concise documentation; but it is well worth the effort to ferret out what you need and increase your knowledge of the sim. The effort you make is directly proportional to your enjoyment and just plain fun. I ESPECIALLY LIKE BLOWING THE HORN AND RINGING THE BELLS! whoooooooooooo! whoooooooooooo! ALL ABOARD!"
1,Two identical discs,"This is a warning to buyers of the Atari re-release of this game: I purchased it recently, and during install, learned that the two install discs are identical. Worse, they are marked disc one and disc two. But the contents of the discs are the same and cause the software to fail installation. Be prepared for this trouble."
3,It's Good...but...,"This simulator is good, providing you only want to ride and deal with a few trains only. It lacks of sense and proper means to build your own lines or to create a train of your own. Also, is very difficult to find out how you can improve or create new trains. I will only recommend this game for starters in the train simulation ""business"".Otherwise, in my opinion, Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006, from AURAN ,is probably the best in its class."
4,Microsoft Train Simulator,"It's a lot harder than you would think to move a train from station to station and this program allows you to experience many of the challanges actually encountered. Beginning at the easiest level of difficulty (to learn to operate the train and fimiliarize yourself with the track layout) and progressing to the most difficult level is much more difficult than you think. I have a great deal more respect for those responsible to move trains around the country. Yes, it could be better, but still a lot of fun and challange for young and old alike. Enjoy!"
2,"Great, But.....","I really enjoy this game, but my computer doesn't. I have Windows Vista and for some reason this program gives my system the heebie-jeebies. It does not like to load. When it does the program hesitates to follow commands. Microsoft is putting out a new Train Simulator. I trust I'll have better luck with that one."
4,New favorite audio book,"Our new favorite book on tape! Very original and unusual. Not a rehash of your typical talking magical animals on an adventure. If your family enjoys the Redwall series or similar titles then you will enjoy this. There were a few times when we backed the audio up to make sure we actually heard what we thought we heard. It would make a good movie. I can't believe this isn't more popular! The reader's voice was very enjoyable in the audio addition we found, and he did the different characters in a convincing manner. We are looking for a sequel!"
1,Avoid This Guide,"The real problem with the Zagat approach is that it is too easy for a restaurant to stuff the ballot box with votes for itself. If you believe the restaurant descriptions here, you think that the worst 30-something restaurants in the Bay Area are packed with rich venture capitalists. It is more of a pickup bar guide than a reputable restaurant guide."
5,Good Floor Mat,"Nice heavy duty floor mat. Good size, not to big not to small. should last a long time. cleans easily."
2,Wait for the Cliff's Notes,"The Guns of Normandy; A Soldier's Eye View, by George G. Blackburn, has received a landing craft load of praise as the be-all, end-all epic of Canadian experiences in 1944 France. While the work is certainly exhaustive, from training camp songs to sample menus from compo-rations, Blackburn's style is ponderous and distracting. No doubt, his second person ""YOU ARE THERE"" narration is a wartime, Murrow-esque convention, intended to give the reader a beachhead view of things. Unfortunately, the result is impersonal, heavy-handed, and distracting. Even in the heat of action, Blackburn's use of ""you"" instead of the more direct ""I"" dilutes the experience -- coveying images, but little feeling.Searching for a Canadian entry for best WWII personal narrative, then try ""And No Birds Sang"" by Farley Mowat - far fewer waving Maple Leafs and far more readable."
1,Poor Quality,Not as advertised - this product looks and feels like costume adornments. Spend your money elsewhere.
2,"Confusing, bad organized.","Isn't the book you need if you have trouble with biochemistry. I often tried to search for answers about general topics and couldn't get a single one. If you are a med student,better switch to Lehninger's Principles of Biochemistry."
2,Biochemistry for Dummies,"I am a medical school professor and am familiar with the different biochemistry textbooks. Harper's is a simplified text book that does not have the detail of depth of information one finds in the gold-standard texts of Lehninger or Stryer. There is a reason why these texts and not Harper's are much more commonly found in the undergraduate, graduate and medical school classrooms. Harper's is ok for the educated layperson or for the non-biologist who wants an overview of biochemistry."
1,Recommended for those who are planning to hate biochemistry,"The problem with this book is not the veracity of its information but the way it is written. Some experts will probably get along with it but the neophytes will suffer with the boring, confusing, tiresome style of almost all chapters. I believe that Harper's is the great responsable for many generations of biomedical students that see biochemistry as a unappealing discipline, albeit essential. If I were a student I would buy this book only for inducing sleepiness or boredom. This is the first time ever I give a one star to a product of this site, but Harper's does deserve it. In this very same Amazon.com one can find biochemistry texts which are superb, must have and, above all, friendly to read."
2,"it is VERY confusing, badly organised and HARD to read","bassically thatIt is the text we used in our course, and we (the students) didn't like it very much and resorted to other books.Harper's is not detailed enough in some things, and is very random in its thoughts. It doesn't explain things clearly. Quite hard to read."
1,"cheap poorly made, waste of money",This item is cheap and impossible to put together. The plastic incubator part is the biggest fault of this item. It doesn't seem possible to correctly put the plastic incubator over the greenhouse part. Its too tight and constantly comes apart while trying to correctly attach it to the base. Save yourself some aggravation and money and go with another product.
3,"Good information, but outdated.","Just finished this book this morning. It was very interesting reading the stories and I in fact stopped smoking 3 days ago. But...the stories seemed outdated and talked about a lot of people smoking in offices and homes, etc. You don't see that much these days. Plus, knowing the book was published in 1991, I subconciously added 10 years to the age of everyone in each story and that made me think ""I wonder if they stayed quit?"" The last section of the book after the stories is very repetitive. ""As so-and-so said on page xxx...."" seems to be in every other sentence.I'd recommend reading it still, but better if you can borrow a copy or get it from the local library.Good luck on quitting!"
4,Useful Information,I liked the way this book was laid out; different perspectives from different people's experiences on what helped them quit. Here's hoping my Dad reads it and actually quits.
5,The Return of the Blues,"This is a wonderfully refreshing album of some of the best blues-based rock that I have ever heard! "" Don't Walk Away "" is a great song that has a pop rock feel to it! The musicianship on the record is top notch! Brad Wilson's guitar playing brings new meaning to the word shred. He soulfully grinds those strings on his Les Paul to an audible climax! The rhythym section of J.J. Garcia on the drums and Brian James on the Bass is as tight as they come. After first hearing the song, "" Teaser "" in the John Carpenter ""VAMPIRES"" movie it prompted me to seek these fellas out. In addition to this cd, I also have picked up their new effort titled, "" Here Before."" Once it appears on amazon.com I will give you the goods on that one also! To fans of great rockin' blues across the country, I tell you this, "" You must add this cd to your collection. It is hard rockin, nose to the grindstone blues with an edge. A VERY SHARP EDGE!"
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought a case of these for about $1/each. You get what you pay for. It's better than not having a filter in the furnace, but they don't trap a majority of the debris and you MUST make sure to change them every 30days. I would likely buy a higher quality next time."
2,Order was deceptive,I ordered this video thinking I was getting the entire series since the order did not indicate it was only Part I. I was highly dissapointed after receiving a tape of PART 1. I know it was a three-part series when it aired in the 80s on television. I deserved the entire series. I would have wanted to know that this was only Part I before I made the purchase. I feel like I was hoodwinked.
2,"1st have great,2nd half no show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Like the above named buyer,i loved part #1,but i thought i was buying the whole mini-seris!!!!!!!!!!!!.Now i see that's not the case.The seller shouldn't have sold the tape if the whole thing wasn't part of the package.This is very,very disapointing!!!!!!!!!(excuse the poor spelling)"
2,Not what I thought it would be,Pros: The repetition will allow you to catch on. The exercisers all move in synch.Cons: I was expecting a high intermediate/advanced workout. The step routine was repetitive and perhaps more directed towards beginners. The neon green background with the big red circle was an awful combination-- considering the exercisers were wearing blue and black. I didn't really care for the music. There aren't many variations to the moves (ie. high impact vs. low impact) which I'm used to from many of my other videos. I got the impression that this was converted from VHS to DVD. I don't really know much about CIA workouts to be sure on this one.. but it wasn't crisp -- as newer dvds are.
1,Wrong video,tghis was no the video Ithought it was going to be. The description wasn't correct or perhaps I just misread it
2,Unrealistic,"Excessive meaningless dialogue. Unrealisticcharacters (i.e., arguing w/superior officer).Competion between characters instead ofgoal oriented. Total lack of military discipline."
1,Bad...just plain bad.,"Bad acting, bad audio, bad cinematography, shots of planes and tanks look like they're left over B footage from some cheesy 80s military movie. I couldn't make it past the first 10 minutes without turning it off."
1,could have been so much better,"As much as I admire the dedication, bravery, and skills of the SEALS, this film just does not do them justice. It is heavy-handed, clumsy, and amateurish."
1,Poor script. Unrealistic portrayal. Worse than B Grade Movie.,"The script was maudlin and hokey. The action portrayed was unlike a Seal Team action - Seals are covert and silent. Scenes with players silhouetted in the skyline of a ridge is not real, and even none Special Forces warriors know better. The writers and director(s) have no concept of Seal Team Operations. This was an hour and a half wasted time."
2,Seal Team VI- One too many,"Another Seal Team spinoff. Short on action and long on story. Would have trouble labeling this ""Action and Adventure"" genre."
5,Great Case,Easy to remove Pod.Protects the screen and the wheel.way better then other expensive cases i have had
5,The best show on TV,"I love this show. It is great entertainment! Campy, fun and emotional. Thanks Rupaul and the seasons keep getting better."
4,Very easy installation,"Up and running in less than an hour. Easy to use wire connectors and plenty of wire to make the full run of the front of my house. Now comes the ""fun"" part of trenching all the wire ... half way there."
5,Very nice product.,"The most difficult part of this was installing an outside electrical outlet. If you already have one of those then this is a very easy installation!The connectors are just a bit tricky to get each half lined up correctly ... but when they do, they slide/lock into each other ... and then just squeeze them together until the light comes on. Worked just fine every time. No problem.I have six of the lights hooked up to the box ... they look great. I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Malibu 4-Pack Electric Landscape Lights,"Very easy to set up, bright lights, sufficient amount of cable. Our previous landscape lights were Malibu and they lasted over 8 years. We had since sold that house and the new owners are still using them 3 years later. I bought these for my mother's house and her house is now the brightest on the block. They look great and they're great for security lights. Only brand we will buy."
1,Bad transformer.,I purched this Malibu lighting kit before theysold the company to Intermatic almost 10 to 20 days. ButIntermatic did not honor werrenty b/c it was purched 10 days beforetheir owner ship of the company. I think this company is a joke... theyshould produce better product to make costomer satisfy or replace transformerif it is under werrenty.
5,The best I've read so far!,"Here is my opinion of ""Trading from the Inside"".... I was introduced to the world of commodities about a year and a half ago and have bought a dozen books and courses on the subjest. Some were good, some okay, some will serve well as fire starter in an emergency kit for a vehicle (TWMPMM burns real well, did I say that out loud?). They claim that the world of commodities is either the easiest way you can make a living in the world or drowned the ordinary lay person with page upon page of jargon and monotony. Finally a book written by someone who is not only down-to-earth but who communicates his knowledge in an easy to understand format. This is the first book on the subject that I can honestly say I am looking forward to reading a second time. Well done Mr. Kellogg!"
2,Nothing special,Very basic book on trading. Seems more to be a platform for the author to promote his brokerage business and trade simulator software. Much better books out there.
2,Very Very Basic,I you are an experienced trader this book is absolutely not for you. The material covered in the book is very very basic and lacks details. I found the book absolutely over priced for what it is.
2,Expected More,"The author described some of his strategies which he did not really delve into detail whatsoever. Most of the information given given can be found elsewhere for free, nothing out of the ordinary.If yoiu are looking strategies, you will be disappointed."
5,E jekayin oluwa rap version,This track is awesome. I hope all Nigerians will appreciate what this guy did. I bought the CD from the artist himself. john if you read this keep up a nice work. Looking forward to your second release. Good luck. Rich
3,Ended up with a used book,"My complaint isn't with the book, it is with Daily Deal who sold it. Not knowing the cost of this thing I paid 5 time the cover price and received a used book. Won't be dealing with Daily Deal ever again. As for the book, it was a gift for my 90 year old mother who couldn't see the Jumble in newspaper any longer. She is happy doing her daily puzzle in this thing.Did I mention my dissatisfaction with Daily Deal?"
4,Jumble puzzles,"The Giant Jumble Puzzle book purchased on Amazon.com is just what someone needs to keep their mind active and their hearts jovial. The puzzles are challenging, the print great and the intensity of pictures clear and catching.The reason for it not being a five star is that the book is quite large and difficult to carry out of the home. The word ""Giant"" doesn't mean the number of puzzles but its size.Lee"
3,Super Reader,"In this short book Elric gets tangled up with the whole bizarre crew at the End of Time, Lord Jagged, Werther de Goethe, all those guys.There is another Elric story where the Lords of Chaos give him a task to undertake.The book also includes a couple of essays about Elric and others, by Moorcock, and also his Sojan stories that were written early on. Sojan being a Carter/Gordon/Kane type of interplanetary swashbuckler."
2,Ich - Horrible,"The only reason I give it 2 stars is because it is Elric. This book was complete garbage, and this from a huge fan of the series. I liked the ""Fortress of the Pearl"" and ""Revenge of the Rose"" books that were written after the original series. This was the only book I think I ever read that I actually stopped reading it about halfway through - I simply couldn't take any more. I did try, trust me I tried..."
2,deluxe office desk chair review,when we first got it it was missing parts. took a bit for the seller to respond and send missing parts.had the chair for about 10-12 months and it brokei would not get this
2,Image problem,I find it very difficult to purchase a product that I cannot see a full image: the base of the 2nd tier stand cannot be seem. It's the part that connects to the 1st stand. I'm not secure in purchasing something that doesn't make me confident in its structure. thank you!!
4,Good,"This is a very comprehensive textbook, however, I will not recommend it to readers that only has an interest in the subject. Some of the content is highly mathematical, and as such meant for serious students in this field. The book covers a very wide range of subjects in this field."
4,A good video that covers almost 90 years of Duke Basketball,"Not the most fancy of videos, but a must see for those die-hard Duke fans. From Card to Krzyzewski, Jay Bilas, the host, discusses the origins of Duke Basketball to winning the National Championship in 1992. Good interviews with several Duke Greats and former Coaches.-DBD"
3,Not a fan of the large cardboard piece...,"I don't know whether the real thing comes with a large hard flat piece sewn into one side, but to me it feels like wearign a big piece of cardboard strapped to my head. Not the most comfortable thign ever. I'd have been happy without it sewn in, just with regular favric. This was a gift for a friend's kid. Hopefully he'll like it. We'll see... For me, it's only 'okay.'"
3,i'm probably just being picky,"the case and mat are both pretty nice. i had to return the item because it bothered me that the case has three velcro attachments to the middle of the mat. i could've probably easily used a seam ripper to take off the velcro, but i thought i would rather continue looking for a case that i liked without any modifications. also, the mat was a soft cotton that curled at the corners a bit when it is fastened around the case.if you're not particularly finicky about these things, the case and mat will do a good job of protecting your counter and flat iron, and i do really like that there is a divider in the case that keeps the cord from getting melted by the hot iron."
5,inspiring,"this movie was insightfull and inspiring, a movie that makes you think and come to understanding, i recomend this movie highly"
4,Stranger than . . .,"This movie stands the concept of Christian outreach on its head, and deservedly so. Any time a Christian thinks he or she can reach out to others about the faith by using a formulaic approach, he ignores both the uniqueness of Christ and the unique character of the individual to whom he is speaking. If nothing else, this movie drives home that point. Christ met the people of His earthly time at their point of need. We cannot afford to do anything less."
2,they should give it away for FREE,"The makers of this movie should be giving it away for FREE as it is an evangelism tool. You should not have to pay for evangelism! They should be ashamed of themselves for charging money for this crap. The story is only a bit better than ""A Perfect Stranger"", which sucked, one star. The teeny bopper was somewhat believable as an art student. For this, it gets 2 stars. Bad story. Bad acting. They should have paid me money to watch this crap. Put the dvd on your fruit tree to keep squirrels from eating your fruit."
4,Great for Youth who are searching for God.,"This video is a little slow but if you can get the youth to watch it, they will get a lot from it. I showed this movie on the bus on the way back from a mission trip. About half the bus watched it and was interested. The other (more hyper - action type) kids won't be quiet thru any movie except real action movies. If one youth watched this movie - it will be worth it. I am a youth leader and will keep this movie for great discussions."
4,I'd like to meet this Perfect Stranger,I watched this movie with my teenage grandchildren. They were facinated with this movie. It answered many questions in a non confrontational way. What a great way to talk about God while exposing religion.
5,Awesome Christian movies,"There are not too many Christian movies out there that earn my rating of awesome but ""The Perfect Stranger and ""Another Perfect Stranger"" are right up there with the best of them for sure. I would recommend them to anyone who ever questioned belief and faith in Jesus Christ. Thank you Amazon for your quick delivery and ease in ordering such a heart touching tool. Sincerely, Bonnie Little"
4,Q Thomas Reader,"Clear, concise and informative. The book covered most of the areas I was seeking about ""The Gospel of Thomas"" and information on the Gnostic sect of the 1st thru 5th Century."
4,$11.50 if you like to put my whole weight on the pin and these handles facilitate that.,"Also, this pin can roll inside a rectangular pan and I won't feel the need to buy a pastry roller now. I only wish it was made of a nonporous material and was dishwasher safe. It needs heavy flouring which may distort the recipe."
5,the best rolling pin!,"This has to be the best rolling pin I have ever used. I've been an avid baker for the past twelve years, and I must say that the design of this product is ideal for those who use a rolling pin often. The placement of the handles allows for you to apply pressure with ease. I have found that I can roll thin, flaky crusts with less effort than a regular rolling pin. Your dough will have uniform thickness (on thinness) with this rolling pin."
3,Music and Madness,"My copy only contained the titular novella.Michel Faber is one of my current fave authors, but I must admit I didn't get this one... Strange cos the interesting elements were all in there: the gothic chateau, the inhuman voice in the woods, the dysfuncfional group dynamics of a vocal HARMONY group... and yet something seemed to be missing... His other works like 'The 199 steps', short story collections 'Some Rain Must Fall' and 'The Fahrenheit Twins' were great though."
3,Existentialism dragged down by modern assumptions,"Faber's writing is dreamlike: precise, diverse in language, colorful in metaphor and like many European writers, unafraid to layer metaphors through the use of similar sounds, shapes and mental motions. Where it fails is its ""workshop"" tendencies, which distill characters to motivations inherent to their situation and give them little chance of transcendence or growth, which in these allegorical tales is how they exist. Characters are enigmatic and lifelike but still cutouts that symbolize stasis and not progress. It seems to me that Faber's writing is light years ahead of his thought."
4,Always different,"Faber does a great job of creating new and interesting settings and situations. Though I found the (96 pages) Courage Consort to be somewhat boring and lacking in interesting plot elements, I was greatly rewarded by continuing on to The Hundred and Ninety-Nine Steps (90 pages) and The Fahrenheit Twins (45 pages). The latter reading like a surreal cross between a fairy tale and the second floor of The Shining hotel."
2,Absolutely nothing compared to their self-titled album,"We've all seen it before, heavy bands go soft. It happened to Incubus, it happened to The Used and now it's happened to American Hi-Fi. This CD is absolutely nothing compared to their self-titled album. None of the tracks on this CD have the energy of songs like A Bigger Mood and Hi-Fi Killer. All these new songs are soft wussy crap like I'm A Fool, only worse. It really is a shame to see such a great band take a big dive and I'm very disappointed. I would recommend the first two AHF instead of this load of crap."
1,Not what I was hoping for.....,"A lot of people seem to be pleased with the new sound American Hi-Fi went with on this album. Personally I think its terrible. I was hoping for another in your face rock album in the mold of Art of Losing. Instead I bought some popped out, 80's influenced garbage. I know Butch Walker produced this album, and you will not find a bigger Butch fan than myself (his former band Marvelous 3 was the greatest and both of his solo efforts are amazing), but American Hi-Fi was not the band to try and experiment a new sound with. If you're looking for something COMPLETELY different than their first 2 albums buy this one, if you want to rock, this isn't the CD for you."
2,Disappointing,"Well, i just picked this CD up. I listened to it and such. I really don't know where to start. I like American Hi-Fi. I've liked American Hi-Fi for 4 years at least. Their first 2 CDs were great, and i'll prolly have for a long time. Their new one, however will be sold to FYE tomorrow.It sounds like an attempt to get popular on MTV, which failed. They had better luck with that on their previous releases. This CD is quite poppy compared to their prior CDs. I wouldn't go as far as calling them sell outs, but they should put the music before the money.I was instantly reminded of a band called Midtown. Their most recent CD was a forced attempt at a ""more mature"" CD. This sounds like just that. I guess that's all i have to say about this monstrocity. I'd have rated it a 1, but i like American Hi-Fi, and i save 1s for CDs that deserve them"
4,Maybe Won't Do...,"A very different album than the american quartets past 2 offerings. ""Hearts On Parade"" is still, undeniably, American Hi-Fi but with a different side. It's hard to describe but...well, buy it and you'll find out, you won't be sorry you did! ""Highs and Lows"" has to be one of the better songs on the album, but all are good, much like the band really!!"
4,"WAY different... not like old AHF, but still good","""hearts on parade"" is a good album, but hard-core AHF fans might be disappointed by it. it's very pop, but not in a bad way. it has (in my opinion) less filler material than the first two albums. on ""the art of losing"", there was lots of filler (rise, gold rush) and on their first album there was lots of filler, too. on ""HOP"" the good songs weren't nearly as perfect as on the other two albums, but every song is a good song.the problem is, the guitar/bass players seemed to have lost the keys to the studio, because they were absent on most of the songs. but this was a good album nonetheless"
4,The Description Is Wrong!!!,"Upon opening the unit and reading the Owner's Guide I learned that the low power setting is 1350 vice 1000 watts as advertised. This really doesn't mean that much personally, but for someone relying on the 1000 watt power setting, this is a game changer. Amazon should verify their listing for accuracy... hear that Quality Assurance? Otherwise this is one fine heater!Dec 07, 2012: One year later and still running strong. Someone asked where it was made.... In China where just about everything is made these days."
3,Patton Milkhouse Utility Heater,"Very good for the money.Takes the cold ""edge"" off.Is noisy, but it does the job. Auto-thermostat works great!Bought at WalMart yesterday for $18.00Lists here at Amazon for $24...Anyway, does what it's supposed to."
2,Looks good but is noisy,This Patton heater is a made in China copy of a Titan heater and although it looks good it's too noisy. Even on the low power setting the fan runs fast. Since I have one of the original Titan's I can make a direct comparison. The noisy fan and what I judge to be an under size power cord were reasons enough to return it. Amazon has a good return policy so all I've lost is the shipping costs. Still I wish the heater were good enough to keep.
1,Terrible,"Loud, poor heat ouput, extremely high amp draw, long time to heat. Used for a small bedroom. Can not believe how noisey it is. It vibrates like a big block chevy."
1,Poor Quality Product,"I purchased two of these heaters as backups in case of furnace failure. The furnace has failed. One heater is working OK. The other failed to function, one day AFTER the Amazon return expiration date. I called the heater manufacturer's warranty line, and was told they would send me one -- but they didn't have any. I was told to ""call back"" in ""a couple of weeks"" and again request a replacement, they might have one by then. Or maybe not.Do not buy one of these if you are concerned about reliability."
3,Disappointed,"This heater looks exactly like one I had from another manufacturer. Both put out good heat. However, the thermostat on the Patton broke within the first year.The other brand lasted more than 5 years. Would not buy another Patton."
5,"Efficient, functional, reliable",Fifteen hundreds watt of heat is 1500 watts of heat whether its in a fancy wood case powered by quartz bulbs or whether its in a metal cabinet devoid of esthetics. This is an efficient and reliable space heater and is an exceptional value.
4,Second one in 15 years,"I just purcahsed my second Patton in 15 years, that's how long the otherone lasted. I use it in my garage office and it gets banged around alot, it is make out of metal and not plastic and is very rugged."
2,Patton u milk house heater,"Once I read the enclosed information about this heater I realized how hot it gets, how much it sparks and can set stuff on fire, etc. Even dangerous in the basement or the garage."
2,"Even at the max temp, not warm enough.","Mine seemed to turn off at around 60 degrees, which wasn't warm enough for me. Very frustrating since my own heater was basically telling me, ""no, no, that's warm enough""."
2,It works but is is a cheep little thing.,"I grew up with similar units that were sturdy, well built and lasted forever. This little thing is made very cheep.The top handle did not come installed. Apparently it was either too much labor to put in the last two screws or it was too expensive to make the box 1"" taller to fit the heater with the handle on. :(The picture shows a nice comfort grip on top but mine didn't come with that. The switch in the picture shows ""hi"" ""low"" labels but mine just had roman numerals ""I"" and ""II"" which just seams goofy.Overall, I would say spend a couple more bucks and get a better built unit. I can't imagine this poorly built thing will last more than a few months."
2,Noise and overheating issues,"We have a very high ceiling in our bedroom and lose warm air quickly, so we need a space heater on nights when it's very cold. The cat ate through the cord on our old one, which we had for many years. I chose this one as a replacement because it as similar in design to the first and was about the same price, but that's where all similarity ended.I find this heater unusually loud, and it overheats rapidly without a VERY large area on all sides - I'd guess at least 3 feet.It's still working after 2 months, but the problems are frustrating and I wish I'd purchased a different model."
3,Fairfox,Sturdy & useful in small area heating. At Amazon I paid about $33. I saw the same item for $19.99 in the biggest discount chain. Can't be operated as Fan only.
5,The finest salt in all the Shire,"This is my favorite finishing salt. I've tried many different salts that the sell at The Meadow, and this is by far my favorite. The aroma is positively intoxicating. I use it as a finishing salt, primarily on raw vegetables like carrots and snap peas. It really brings out the sweetness of the raw vegetables, and provides a cherry smoke backbone that really complements raw vegetables."
5,Don't miss out on this funny book!,"My daughter and I read a lot of books, but this one became an instant favorite. The story is fun and the illustrations are outstanding. We checked this out at the library, but will adding it to our collection soon."
1,All the illustrations are missing,"The most significant part of this book is the unique graphical representations Youmans developed to represent elements and their behavior in compounds. Youmans spends a great deal of time discussing how his illustrations were conceived and his discussions all assume that you can look at the illustrations.This reproduction simply skips over any pages with illustrations, so pages 17-20, 35-36, 43-44, 53-54, 57-58, 61-62, 65-66, 73-74, 77-78, 81-82, 87-88, and 95-96 are missing. The publisher's description says, ""This book may have occasional imperfections such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc. that were either part of the original artifact, or were introduced by the scanning process"" but that does not imply that ALL illustrations would be omitted. A terrible misrepresentation and it makes the reproduction virtually useless."
4,Nice Texture-Will Buy More,"I loved the feel of this lip gloss, (not too sticky) and the flavor was not overly sweet. Rated 4 stars only because the color did not work too well on my NW43 complexion. However, I have already ordered one of the sheer lip glosses because I like the quality. The company also sent a nice sized sample of the bubble bath and I am considering purchasing more as gifts!"
4,I ordered this because I saw it in LUCKY magazine,"Well, I just received the lip gloss today and I have given it a try. It's not sticky like MAC, it has the same consistency as Lancome Juicy Tubes. That's the best way to describe it. Nice fruity smell to it...pretty gloss as well.Overall it's a nice product, with nice gloss and it's not sticky."
4,Darby shines in MIRI,"Trek occasionally pitted the starship crew against some horrid space-born epidemic, only to find a miracle cure just before the credits rolled. Miri did it best. It's one of Trek's darker episodes, with undercurrents of child violence and adolescent sexuality. Kim Darby and Michael Pollard are superb. Unfortunately the second episode on the DVD, ""Conscience"" is not up to ""Miri's"" standard."
5,Attracting Perfection in Life!!!!!,I have found this book to be powerfully amazing. I'm using it to attract foster parents to my organization and the results are phenominal.It's also a little wild - I've started to attract perfect sales people too.
5,Great Book & has already helped me grow my business,This is a great book that helps change your thoughts around sales and building your business. this is my second copy this is a must for someone starting a business or trying to move to the next level.
4,Attracting Perfect Customers: The Power of Strategic Synchronicity,"This book was recommended by my business coach but, I apply it to every relationship in my life! The law of attraction and strategic synchronicity are helpful to stay focused on what it is that you REALLY want. We can choose to be the 'lighthouse' and the 'perfect customer' will find us."
5,Refreshing and easy to read,Some things you already know but being reminded is refreshing. Every since reading this book my business is better. I will be re-reading this book in my life.
2,Full of fluff,"I was very attracted to the title of this book, but I could not find anything in it that was fresh, helpful or concrete. The tone of the book is cloying and New Age-ish. And to top it off, the book ends with 18 pages of advertising for the authors' friends and colleagues. All in all, a HUGE disappointment."
2,Weird or what?,"This book was recommended by a respected colleague so I bought it. Very strange, especially the ""if you can think it you can make it happen"" section. Some good tips, but other parts are a bit mystic-weirdo. I don't plan to use any of this, and won't be recommending it to others. And I'll have an interesting chat with my colleague...!"
5,Reader-friendly book offers a history lesson like no other,"Thank you, Mr. Blackburn. The desire to know what my father went through when he was a young man, just married, hit me like a ton of bricks. Suddenly, I craved any and all information I could find. Your trilogy, The Guns of Normandy, The Guns of Victory, and Where the Hell are the Guns?, satisfied my craving. I see Dad in England training for tank duty without tanks, only broomsticks and rope. I can picture my father sleeping under his Sherman tank, trying to avoid being hit but desperately needing sleep - I feel the bitter cold, the tiring mud, and the fear of thousands of other men struggling to carry out their orders so they can go home. Without these books I could not relate to my father's experience except through the dry, statistical accounts of the historians. I'm very grateful to Mr. Blackburn."
5,2nd Person works for me,"Not sure who all these Yankees are reviewing the quintessential Canadian war memoir, but they have good taste.Written in the second person, this book is unique, but it doesn't end there. Blackburn has a rare ability to recall small details and the entire story rings with authenticity. His stories run the gamut, as all good war memoirs do, from the sad to the hysterically funny.Second Canadian Division seems to have produced few authors (unlike the First Division, with Mowat taking the lead) but those few that have put pen to paper have been incredibly good. Whitaker and Williams were best when recounting the history of others, and this memoir stands out above any war memoir written by a Canadian in any single war. All three books in the trilogy are a terrific source of information about the Canadian Army in the Second World War."
1,Absolutely terrible.,"I wouldn't consider myself too picky on the obvious spelling and technical errors; for someone who was recently enrolled in an IB economics course, I was pretty much open to any help. Unfortunately this book doesn't cut it. Not only does the author explain concepts and theories in an unfathomable manner, he also manages to throw in complex ideas at the worst of times. I took the IB economics exam two years ago, and let me tell you, this book provided me with zero help. Time and time again, I thought it was just me and I used it as a reference for the papers and exams due in the course. And each time, it provided me with zero and sometimes negative assistance. Please, if you want to pass your class and the IB exam with flying colors, then I recommend the IB Economics Course Companion!"
5,IC Review,"Ultimate strategy game. Nothing better. Absolutely the best. I loved it! I got it for christmas. Also there is online gaming, clicking multiplayer IC online create screenname and your good to go!"
2,Doesn't inflate to acceptable level or stay inflated,This thing doesn't hold air... The rugby playing child I bought it for tossed it after getting tired of re-inflating it.
3,I love the idea and the detail...,"However, I have ordered not one, but two of these toys and both of the necks of the guitars are bent backwards and broken. I was VERY disappointed when the second one came in the mail, bubble wrapped and protected, and the guitar was, yet again, messed up. This should be fixed by the company asap."
5,Great toy but would Kurt have loved it?,I am not an expert on Kurt Cobain but to me this toy stands for everything he was against. He really seemed to be to be against commercialization and pop when it comes to his music.
4,Cross stitch alphabets and cats... great combination,"Alphabets are very popular and combined with cats are an enjoyaboe project for those of us who appreciate both in our homes. Each letter is charted with an individual cat. The alphabet is large and attractive. Keys for the charts recommend letter colors, but can be changed. Charts are of black and white symbols, and the letters are about the same height, 101 squares high. Ten projects are highlighted - lavender bag, a foot stool, pin cushion, tea towel and a cot quilt. There is a page of British needlecraft suppliers, and a cotton conversion chart (for the colors used) for DMC, Anchor, Coats and Madeira floss."
4,"Pretty good, but not one of my top favorites","Both episodes were pretty good. Both cases, they really shined due to the choice of female cast...the characters of Andrea in episode 10 and Helen in Episode 11. Both very gorgeous.Not quite sure what legion1 is talking about with ""banned"" episodes, unless he means banned in England. The ""Green Lady"" wasn't from a ""frightening"" episode. She was, instead a human woman made to look like an Orion slave girl; one of the illusions forced upon Captain Pike in the original pilot, ""The Cage,"" and then shown later in ""The Menagerie.""All in all, I'd have to say that ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"" is the better of the two episodes, with little snippets of humor throughout; such as Kirk's comment to his android duplicate, ""Eating is a pleasure, sir. Unfortunately, one you will never know."""
3,Kirk vs. the mad scientists,"The crew of the Enterprise faces off against a couple of mad scientists in this pair of middling episodes from the classic 60s SF series.""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"" is the better of the two. Written by veteran genre author Robert Bloch, it tells the story of Dr. Roger Korby's doomed attempt to populate the universe with androids. Ted Cassidy's frightening performance as the gigantic Roc is the highlight of the episode. The way in which messy human emotions befuddle and destabilize arrangements based on the repression of said emotions became a Trek cliche, but it's probably not fair to criricize this episode on that basis since it was among the first to introduce it.""Dagger of the Mind"" is less interesting. Somehow Dr. Tristan and his mind-warping device just don't seem like a worthy enough threat to cross the flagship of the Federation. In addition, it depends on unprofessional behavior on the parts of Kirk and Dr. Helen Noel for much of the drama."
4,"""It's hard to believe someone could die from loneliness""","""It was the... Neu... ral... neut-ralizer!"" In 'Dagger of the Mind' the Enterprise picks up a deranged lab assistant, Dr Van Gelder, formerly assigned to a prison for the insane. Kirk beams down to this prison planet to make sure every thing's alright. Kirk soon finds himself subject to the Neural Neutralizer, a brainwashing device used by prison director Dr Adams, that, 'empties the mind'.Fearing Kirk is in danger Spock beams down to the planet and disables the power grid. With the power outage Kirk knocks out Dr Adams and escapes. But Adams was knocked out under the Neutralizer. When the power's restored, he's killed by his own device. McCoy saying, ""It's hard to believe someone could die from loneliness"".""Not if you've sat in that chair"" Kirk says."
3,its ok,kinda cheap but it works deffintly not army surplus but if you need a light it does the job for you
5,Lmfao........,"okay for everyone that says these ""moonbeams"" suck. Youre right. These are the exact same ones we used in bootcamp. And they were horrible. They broke everyday from drill instructors throwing them lol. But they are military issue. Remember the gov't is cheap. Usmc boot grad dec 7 '12 Fox Company. Plt 2096"
4,Nice little light. Good for backpackers,"There are some rather harsh reviews out there for what is effectively a 6 dollar flashlight but overall its a pretty nice little military style light. The C cells make me hope it lasts longer than an AA light may. Its reasonably bright, certainly enough for a common backpack trip. I added maglight zenon bulbs for a few bucks and made it much brighter.I like it. Definitely worth the 6 bucks"
1,Defective product,The flashlight didn't work at all. It was a gift for my grandson. I want it replaced. I can't find a place where I can exchange defective merchandise.
3,WAAAAAAAAAAAY Smaller Than The Photo Had Me Believe,I'll have to make due. I suppose. I hope my DS doesn't smoke me for having such a small flashlight.
4,"Well made, but smal","Just got the light today. It's well made, especially for being made in China. It seals up well, works well underwater. Has a spare bulb and various lenses with different colors.But it really is small. I would almost say kids size. It's not the standard military style angle light you normally think of.Overall though, it's pretty nice and I'll definitely use the heck out of it."
4,Good Stuff,"Great To Have If The Power Goes Out. We Lost Power For 3 Days Not Too Long Ago, Man Was I Glad To Have These On Hand!!"
5,invaluable,"The army angle head flashlight. Classic. Ive used this through 3 years and a tour. Batteries last forever, although light output isnt the best. Anglehead and long battery life make it good for reading at night. Ive heard its watertight and can be used for diving, cant verify that personnally though."
1,Junk,Item is like a toy. Cheap plastic. used it twice and the on-off switch fell off. If you could buy this flash light for $2.00 you would be wasting your money. One star is to high.Caveat Emptor.
5,i did not know this was a toy,its a flashlite that takes c batteries instead of d so it is a little small but it does have 4 coloured lenses and an extra bulb but it does the trick. for the price its not bad
4,Small but bright,This light is small but powerful. It does not come with any filters but it is sturdy enough.
2,Not worth it.,"I bought 2 of these for ghost hunting. Within a week, one of the buttons ended up breaking. When i took the lense off to switch out to the red, the plastic screw cap broke. These are NOT metal cased flashlights, they are a light flimsy plastic. I took the working components out of them and let the kids play with them now because they stopped working. It may not be the fault of the seller, but the manufacturer of the flashlights really makes a sub par flashlight."
2,"Portable and durable, but not very bright.","I thought this flashlight could be a handy and frugal substitute for a small rescue-style flashlight. The flashlight was purchased with the intention of being used in conjunction with a headlamp (LED). I liked the pocket clip on this flashlight which would allow for hands-free use while hiking and caving. Unfortunately, design aside, the flashlight is very weak. I would not recommend it for exploring."
1,KNEE DEEP IN IT,THE AUTHORS PROBABLY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY BUT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLETO GET TO IT WITH ALL THE FLOWERY LANGUAGE AND BEATING AROUND THE BUSH.IF THEY EVER LEARN TO COMMUNICATE I MAY TRY TO READ ANOTHER BOOKWRITTEN BY THEM. HAVING A SKILL IN SCIENCE DOES NOT MEAN THERE ISALSO A SKILL IN BEING ABLE TO WRITE.
3,"yes, yes, yes, YES!","Brilliant. This novel is truly hilarious.As you may have read in the other reviews, Stingley is not inventing a new genre or even telling a new story. But the way she tells this story is simply wonderful.I have not laughed out loud while reading in a long time, and there were many moments that I snickering, chuckling, etc, while reading this book. The characters, dialogue, and main character's ruminations are just tasty.I highly recommend this as a fun book to read and enjoy!"
5,Makes you forget your boss sucks.,"This one fits the bill if you are looking for a quick , funny, escapist read. Samantha Stone is quirky, cynical and desperate and this makes for a really fun heroine. Her antics made me laugh out loud and I had a great time reading this book last week after a monumentally crappy day at work. By bedtime I had totally forgotten what a horse's hind end my boss was. If a book can make that happen, it's GOT to be some good stuff!"
3,Not So Original,"I felt like I've seen or read this before, it's very predictable. It reminded me a lot of a few movies I've seen, namely ""The Wedding Date"". The plotline is an overused story of hiring someone to take the place of an imaginary boyfriend. The ending is very blunt and anticlimactic!"
2,they don't go with a lot,that little bit of fur around the top make them not go very well with slacks. Tight legged jeans maybe. Over all not bad.
1,Jarring transitions mar beautiful music!,The sound and performance are fantastic.BUT....the DVD authoring experts[?] destroy the effort with transitions between cuts that jolt the nervous system. There is no delay for the sound to decay. The next cut leaps out before the prior one has finished. At one point the soprano's final note is actually cut in half as the next chorus begins. Extremely upsetting.
2,Poor Performance,"Average production quality. Less than average performance. Poor conductor. Decent ambiance from the rear speakers and bass is deep from the LFE but I've heard better performances.An upcoming second release from Christian Thielemann and the Orchestra of the Deutsche Opera is the one you will want. Skip this release and wait for the next DVD Audio of Orff's Carmina Burana., but never overwhelming. Maybe the upcomins second release of this work could provide a choice of two versions - one ""best seat"" version and one where the listener is ""surrounded"" by the large cast of performers."
5,Great Bank,My son really likes this bank. It's nice and small and very easy to use. It comes in multiple colors and keeps his brothers away from his money!
2,Dont buy it,"i was very disappointed with this product. First of all, when it came in it already had a few scratches on it, and i did order a ""new"" one. Ive had this product for a week now, and unlocked it about 5 times and it has already broken. Though this ""metal"" safe ( more like a lunch box) was only 10 dollars, i would not recommend it. overall ive been very disspointed with amazon's service latley."
5,Very good,I got it for my son and he is very pleased with it. It's exactly what he expected to receive.
4,Great First Bank/Safe for Kids - Except,This is a metal safe makes a great first bank for kids. We purchased 2 of these this year as Christmas gifts. They are simple to use and very simply made. That being said there is only one problem . . . you can't choose which color you order. We ended up with 2 blue and had to label them for the 2 kids. Not a big problem but definitely would have like a choice.
4,Just what she wanted !!!,our granddaughter wanted something to keep her stuff in with a lock-can't pick a color -she got red which she liked--hard to open at 1st but with practice she is getting the hang of it---safe is smaller then I would have liked---but she likes it
4,My son loved it!,"For me it was way too small, but my son, he loved it! and that is all that matters. Thanks."
3,"Fun, not very robust",I had a toy safe back in the 70s. Exactly the same except the tumbler was steel. This one is plastic. As a result the tolerances are low - you can be out by 10 numbers and just exert some force and it will open. It's a pity they scrimped a few cents on the most important part.
3,Good metal safe for children,It's a good metal safe for kids to store their treasures and cash. The combination lock nob is somewhat tricky to turn. My daughter is 10. She had some trouble at first but figured out how best to turn the nob. A younger child may need help to avoid getting frustrated. The combination is fixed and cannot be changed.
3,Good idea but the knob is an issue,"I bought this because I was specifically looking for a kid's metal safe with free shipping. I wish it were bigger, but I knew the size before I bought it. Surprisingly there was not a big selection of other options to choose from for a simple safe for kids. My seven year old son loves it but he has not yet learned how to open it himself because the knob is way too tough to turn back and forth. He still likes it, but to me it takes away from the concept of having a safe for your ""valuables"" if you always have to get someone else to open if for you. I am still glad I got it. I would not order another one for another child unless I knew the knob issue was fixed. I am apparantly not the only one with that complaint."
1,worst bank ever,"We bought 3 of these- one for each of our children. Figured it would be a great Christmas gift as they are usully claiming so-and-so took thier allowance. On one, the door pin immediatly fell out and the combination lock was rough to move. On another, the door would open without even putting in the combination and the final straw- the third one- not even a strong adult could move that dang combination dial.Very disappointed- all going back."
4,Great gift for my nephew,I put a bunch of old coins in it and gave it to my nephew for his birthday; he thought it was great.
3,Different,There's only one word to discribe this collection of short stories and that is it's DIFFERENT.
1,Dreadful after sales support from Casio,"To be honest when the camera was working it was fantastic. Great features, long batery life, easy to use etc. Then 18 months after purchase it broke. Just will not power up. Casio want $250 + shipping to replace it with a rebuilt one. Bye bye casio"
1,poor picture quality,"I bought this camera based on the looks and features and the good reviews on amazon, boy was i dissappointed. Never believe everything ppl say on here. The biggest dissapoinment is the picture quality. I have 3 different digital cameras to compare side by side and this is the worst i've ever seen. the pictures taken indoor turn out grainy and the colors are not as vibrant as the coolpix 4600 or the kodak easyshare. on a bright sunny day it does take good pictures but not as good as the kodak easyshare or the olympus stylus i've used in the past. on a positive note, this camera is one of the best looking and i love the large lcd screen as well as the long battery life but what good does it do if it doesn't take good pictures. i will have to put this one up for sale on the classifieds."
3,Indoor images are bad,"Well, I can not hide the good features in the Z55- Big LCD- Fast playback- Fast start up- MMC/SD (You will enjoy this feature if you have a card reader instead of using the USB base)But I found two bad things in this camera:1. Indoor images are bad (opposite of the great images taken outdoor) I mean if you depend on a bulb light you will get bad images, otherwise it is perfect under the sun.2. Once I make a zoom (after transfering the images to my laptop not in the camera) for the images I dont get the same quality (bad sharpness) - opposite of the SONY T1 models .. everytime you enlarge you get higher qualityFinally, I recommend SONY."
5,LOVE the big LCD!,"My husband bought this camera about 3 months ago and we continue to love it...wow, what an improvement over our old Canon Digital Elph. The Casio is SO easy to use: I've never even looked at the manual. Admittedly, I still have a soft spot for my (aging) Oly C-2100UZ but of course it is not pocketable like this Casio. This little workhorse gets taken anywhere and everywhere and gets a lot of use!The Casio has a HUGE LCD and it feels very sturdy. It's incredibly responsive and just feels good! I'm happy with the picture quality (quite good for a subcompact) and I didn't realize how much I would like the cradle for recharging the camera. We bought an extra battery, and haven't even needed to use it yet!"
5,Worth the money,"This camera is absolutely wonderful. I tried the Z40 and the it was very similar, took great AVI and features were the same, however the quality of the actual digital photo seemed a bit-sub par in my opinion. THis Z55 has a much better picture and really delivers. It takes great AVI footage and clear crisp pictures for such a tiny little camera. It also comes with a cool dock that plugs right into my iMac(or any usb port).I like the 2"" LCD ad the long battery life along with the ZOOM and 5 megapixels.We take pictures and movies all the time now. Invest in a nice photo printer and say goodbye to the photolab!http://exilim.casio.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=cameras.features&exp;_id=46069DA2-0745-4D09-B7F2-EA3AF30CF6A4"
2,Lasted 6 months - Horrible Customer Service,"Great camera, took great pics, everyone loved it. Then one day I went to turn it on and half the screen was black and distorted. The unit was kept in a case and experienced no abuse. I called Casio who said to send it in to an authorized dealer for repair. Six calls and a month later, no repair and a bill for $200 to repair a camera that cost $300 only 6 months from purchase. Neither Casio or the authorized dealer are any help. The LCD display (one of the main reasons for buying) is not covered. As much as I love this camera, I would never buy a Casio again. Terrible customer service and a practically non-existent warranty."
1,Indescribable.,Absolutely agonizing. His voice sounds as if he's been huffing helium and his riffs are the sort that spew from a thirteen-year-old who has just found his first Tupac album.
3,Nice to look at. Not a how-to book.,"Overall, I liked the book by Andy Marcus. Every wedding photojournalist can benefit by seeing more and more different shots--just to stay 'fresh'. It was also interesting reading how Andy got each shot, etc. But that's about it. It doesn't give you pointers on how to shoot photojournalistic weddings and it certainly doesn't go into how to approach the entire day from a photojournalistic viewpoint. This book would be better titled 'Unique Wedding Images in Black and White'. If you're looking for a how-to book on photojournalistic wedding photography, you'll need to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you'd like to see a nice collection of unique images, you'll be happy."
5,Fabulous,"This book tells it as it ought to be. A great book, especially for those photographers who already provide good quality photography to their brides and want to add another dimension. We should all develop the skills to offer our brides what THEY want, not what we THINK they ought to have. This book can definitely help."
3,"Good information, but examples aren't much...","It's hard to take someone serious who's trying to teach you something, if their work doesn't seem all that great. That is the case with this book. Still decent, especially for the price I paid for it ($3) - And just why they have to be all in B/W is beyond me. Heck, even newspapers print in color these days..."
1,Disappointing,"My girlfriend and I were looking for examples of candid, story-telling, photojournalistic style photos for our wedding. However, this book was a total waste of money. The photos are poorly done and fail to inspire any interest in the events they capture. Needless to say, this book gave us great ideas for the type of photos we DON'T want.I don't know what alternative book to recommend, but if you do, please let me know :)"
2,Unique B & W wedding photography,"After reading his book, and, I myself, doing both traditional and photojournalistic weddings, cannot in my heart-n-soul recommend this book as a learning tool for newcomers to the photojournalistic style of weddings. Although his images are quite beautiful, anyone that shoots 15-20 rolls of film should be able to come up with a 120 page book to show for it. He covered lighting, film, lense size, and appeture, but he missed on one important part, which is shutter speed. But I got it from the library, so what do I care."
3,Hidden (subtitles),"I watched most of this movie last night but I didn't finish it because I got tired of reading the subtitles. It was actually scary, suspenseful & a little creepy as well. It was somewhat distracting with the subtitles however. I have every intention of finishing the film @ a later date when I'm not so sleepy. The movie was ok but it won't ever be on my favorite films list. Try it, you might like it if you're into this type of film."
5,The Best Temperament Book,"Like Renee Baron, I came to the study of temperaments through the Enneagram and then through the Myers-Briggs system. For my purposes as a college professor, I find Temperament studies to be far more helpful than the other two systems.A number of excellent books exist on the temperaments, such as Keirsey's, Linda Beren's, and the True Colors books, but Renee Baron's book is the best I've studied. It is simple enough for beginners and detailed enough for professions. Ms Baron's categories include childhood patterns, relationship patterns and occupational patterns, each discussed with depth and thoroughness.Overall, this is the best book on the subject."
2,Pool Master 2: Live Billiars,"This game is kind of fun, but it's not really a good pool game. It's more or less just a crappy program that is similar to pool, and seems fun if you make the best of it."
1,This woman is as mentally ill as the Sandy Hook shooter,"Before you even consider buying this book read the hateful, misinformed, misogynistic column the ""author"" wrote about the Sandy Hill massacre -- blaming the teachers who saved some of the children for being women. If men had been there all would have been OK. Oh wait, that didn't work out in Aurora, did it? Or Columbine. Or Virginia Tech. Quite simply, this woman is delusional and should not be taken seriously in anything she writes."
1,Before buying this book...,"Read the author's commentary concerning the Sandy Hook killings posted on the National Review website on December 19, 2012. Then decide if this person has any credibility or qualification to render an opinion or deliver an intellectually sound argument on anything. Spoiler alert: She doesn't. Outrageous."
1,they don't offer the option of zero stars ...,"wrote an insane blog for the national review, in the wake of the sandy hook killings, I believe this woman to be crazy and I can't imagine why anyone would care to read anything she has to say"
1,I wouldn't support this woman for anything in the world.,"After reading this woman's blog post in the National Review, I can not see how ANYONE could possibly want to read a single word she has ever written. For shame."
1,Godless,"There's no way the same author of this article can know anything worth reading about Jesus. She's destined for warmer, subterranean ""circles"" [...]"
1,Don't buy this book if you want to learn DirectX 8,I just got this book and it was big disappointment. This book starts using DirectDraw right off the bat completely failing to mention anything about the recent incorporation of DirectDraw with Direct3D in DirectX 8! What a let down! That was the whole point of getting it in the first place! The title is very misleading. Don't get this book if you're trying to learn DirectX 8 (never mind all the new cool tricks like pixel shading or vertex shading)! The whole idea of starting to learn game programming with DirectX 8 is that it has been greatly simplified so that you don't have to write as much code and initialization stuff as you would in earlier versions! Stay away from this and learn from on line tutorials instead. They are free at least!
1,Total garbage,"I have tried to read this book but it's very awful. For little experienced programmer, it gives nothing new. But, for a beginner, it tries to teach some 2D directx graphics by explaining his source code. He made its program from many source files and classes, so it's totally ununderstandable for a beginner. I recommend you to not buy this book, there are many better books in amazon.com about this subject. I have totally disappointed. But, of course, it's your money."
5,The Best Game Programming Book Ever,"I picked up this book because I was eagerly interested in moving from OpenGL to Direct X. The instructions in the book were so easy to used that my father was able to program. The book is based around a game that the writer made and throughout the book it explains every part of it. If you want to learn Direct X or start programming, this book is an excelent choice."
4,My first introduction to game programming,"Well, I agree this book is not perfect.Nevertheless, I gave it 4 starts because:- it gave me an insight in general game logic- it gave me a general idea about DirectX- it gives you a fairly good grasp on general animation- and last but not least: by reading this book, I learned OOPBut beware: I highly recommend that if you want to buy this book,you should have at least 1 year of programming experience, preferably in assembly and C. Furthermore, it would be nice that you have some experience with DOS VGA programming (under mode 13H for example). Some knowledge of algorithms and a basic understanding of the WIN API message passing concepts are needed, too.If you don't comply with these requirements, I agree that reading this book is a complete HORROR ;)."
1,What a joke dont buy,"DirectX 8.0 wasnt anywhere to be found. Wonder if the author even knows anything about it besides where to d/l it from. Also once again here we go in 8bit color. Time to teach 16bit graphics dinosaur..One last thought to the author you can't just decide one day to be a game programmer teacher, go work in the industry and put your name on something successful............ PhD!=GameProgrammer ThisBook=FireStarter"
1,DirectDraw is not in DX 8,"This is not a resource for Directx 8 at all. DirectDraw is outdated under DX8 the DX7 version is still available in DX8, but it's not DX8. I was hoping to see the same game from his previous book done in Direct3D using planes and textures. I have yet to find a great DirectX 8 book available."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"Let's get one thing clear: this book is excellent for programmers that want to learn how to program games. It is a good starting point.The problem is that this book does not have a damned thing to do with DirectX 8.0. It teaches you DirectX 7.0, and boy, don't even bother trying DX 8 if all you know is 7... they're completely different in every aspect.I had hoped that this book would be another primer for using Microsoft's DirectX API for the latest version, like Parberry's first, but instead it is a terrible, terrible waste of time and money since it has nothing to do with DirectX 8. The publisher, and the author, are lying to the consumer. Frankly, I was so disgusted I sent it back and I have no intention of ever purchasing another book by Parberry or this publsiher again."
3,Don't Order for an eMachine! Check first!,"I ordered this for an eMachine model W3115. Even though this was a great price and the shipping was super-fast, it did not fit the eMachine. So if you own an eMachine, make sure you get the proper RAM. I needed 185 pin RAM, and this is 240. You can't return it after opening the package, and you must open the package to see the notch to determine if it will fit. If you need standard 240 pin DDR 400 SDRAM, I am sure this is a great deal."
5,Excellent resource for any therapist,"I needed this book for a course in my MSW program, but found it to be very enlightening, and a great reference source in practice."
4,An Anthology review,"I'm not a huge fan of the format. It's a compilation of a whole bunch of different articles. Many are interesting, but some just whine on and on. I thought they could have done a better job for the title, but I guess it did encompass all aspects. It was well written, but just an ok book."
4,Pleased Customer,I'm amazingly happy with this product. With the insanely high prices of textbooks on college campuses it is nice to be able to save money and also get the textbooks quickly. I'm completely satisfied with this seller.
3,a book with historical facts,this book covers all the necessary needs for a person to have counseling training to understand people from all different ethnicity background.
3,"Good, but NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION IS INCORRECT","These soy nuts taste good, but the nutritional information listed in not accurate. These nuts contain more calories and fat, and less fiber than listed. In fact, there are only 2 grams of fiber per serving according to the product packaging."
3,"small beads, not overly salty","On sale, these are $1.99 for a pouch. They are okay and forestall my jones for hard crunchy food. They are better than Terra chips for that but the taste is okay but nothing to write about."
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"I'm a fan of Joseph Murphy, but this book wasn't that good. It goes into what he perceives to be the solely symbolic nature of the Book of John. Apparently he viewed every word in that book as a symbol for something else and not in any way factual. And I'm making it sound more interesting than it actually was. It's more like, ""The boat represents your faith, the sandal represents your will, etc etc."" Ernest Holmes' ""The Hidden Power of the Bible"" is much better on this topic."
5,Better than sex,"I heard these guys on National Public Radio and had to gettheir CD (Interview can be found at ... and search for ""Little Horse."") Anyway, I am just blown away by the energy and cool new sound. It is definitely rock, but has real substance, humer and energy. I'm totally addicted to the album now..."
5,A Professional View,"Very Good series of programs, that teach how the things happened to transform our world into the one we have today. Besides the documentary was made in 2001, it's a good way to learn from the past. The only downside is it duration: almost 1,5h per episode"
5,AC DELCO PUMP,"GREAT REPLACMENT PART AT A GREAT PRICE,LESS THAN HALF THE COST OF FACTORY PART IF NOT MORE,WORKED GREAT AND TOOK CARE OF PROBLEM"
5,Every child should have one of these,"This is the best Christmas book for children short of ""Twas the night before..."". This Christian storybook demands that you hold your child on your knee because the pictures are fabulous. My child insists on being able to study the pictures every time I read it aloud. I got an extra copy and gave it to our local Christian pre-school. Two weeks later I found that about 10 of the teachers had ordered their own copy. You'll love the story, and your children will love the pictures."
5,Well researched and well written for children,"After reading this book to my grandchildren, and seeing how well they responded, I was prompted to write this review. I had read other versions of this story to them, but they did not seem to grasp the crux of the story as well. I highly recommend this book for all children."
