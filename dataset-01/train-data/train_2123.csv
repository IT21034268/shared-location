5,A real tour de force of superb good taste !,"This work is towering punch . There is not a track disappointed . Schon made a glorious journey through the different moods of smooth jazz , working with Jonathan Cain .Caribbean blue may be one of the best and sensual tracks , but Boulevard of dreams , Big moon or Zanzibar . No matter what you choose because there is no waste .Excellent buy and relaxing and refreshing moments that will reward you so many times that you will make of this CD one of your favorites . It has such magnetism attraction and meticulous sense of the harmony that personally I consider it one of the best albums in the nineties decade .A winner album ."
4,VERY SMOOTH,"After reading all the 5 star reviews, I couldn't wait to get into this. After JOHNNY A ( Sometime Tuesday Morning ) THE HELLECASTERS and PHIL KEAGGY ( CD 220 ) this CD didn't reach the standard of the above mentioned artists. My first impression was : TOO MELLOW, TOO CLOSE TO LIFT MUSIK. 3 weeks later I am proved wrong again. After about a dozen or more listens this CD has grown on me and I am slowly but surely falling in love with it. It will take some time for the subtle qualities of this CD to shine through. Georgous melodies and some very original arrangements make for easy listning but never boring music.My wife and most of her friends also love this CD ( in our household a very rare occurance ). If you like the guitar stylings of LEE RITENOUR or LARRY CARLTON you will like this."
5,Very talented musicisn,"Neal Schon has changed his direction considerably since the days of Santana, Journey and Hardline. But he's still a stellar guitarist, regardless of the genre he chooses to embrace. I have most of his CDs and every one is wonderful to listen to, as this man is brilliant."
4,A well written story ; an unusual plot,"The Handyman is a very well written book. The story itself is unusual, as is the Bob, the main character, who is indeed a sort of modern day saint. Yes, there are some cliches in the book--ALL those lonely, helpless, lovable women--and the grant applications that frame the tale are a bit too contrived, but this novel made me think about art and creativity, about kindness and our connections with other people, and about beauty or the lack of it in our everyday lives. It is a fun book to read and I enjoyed its positive, uplifting qualities. I was surprised by the suddenness with which Bob decided on his true love and by the rather abrupt ending to the book--was anyone else caught unaware by this?"
1,The Absolute Worst !!!,"I simply hated this inept novel. How literature has sunk in the last few decades. Everything about The Handyman was poorly done. The characters are so shallowly drawn that they're only flimsy, lifeless cartoons. There is virtually no dramatic narrative or plot. The initial concept was a clever one, but as soon as the author begins executing it, its absurd and amateurish. What a tragedy that a good basic idea like this fell into the hands of a thoroughly unskilled writer who can only assume a flip and hackneyed technique."
1,Extremely Dull and Devoid of Talent,"The critics were out to lunch on this one. One cliche after another. No depth, no drama. As predictable as an afternoon TV soap, only not as compelling or believable. Pure third-rate trash."
5,What an intelligent and delicious read!,"I'd been meaning to read ""The Handyman"" since it came out a year or two ago, but somehow never got around to it. Then, last week, when I was down and out with the flu, I picked the thing up figuring I'd probably only skim a few pages. Au contraire: I was immediately (and happily) swept into the book's thrall. First of all, Carolyn See's fine prose is wonderfully crafted. Yet she has done her work with such a light touch that the reader is only aware of his/her enjoyment, not the writer's effort. The good-natured plot is well worth the trip, for its own sake. But the deeper themes See has laced through her pages (deft and lovely meditations on the nature of creativity, and the varying paths one trods to discover meaning in one's life) make the book's overall effect greater than the sum of its individual parts. ""The Handyman,"" is enchanting, redemptive, smart and just plain fun to read. Thanks Carolyn. I needed that."
2,Great concept unrealized,"Loved reading how it all turns out in the first chapter and then reading how it all began. Great literary device! However, since I couldn't care about any of the characters including the hero, it engaged my writer's/reader's mind but not my spirit. I still don't understand the creative process even though we lived inside the artist. I still don't understand the love process of the key characters even thought we're told it exists. The author just didn't bring it to life. Most of the characters were cartoons and uninteresting ones at that. As always, wish it could be better since there's nothing so great as finding a good book by a talented author. This isn't one."
1,AS BAD AS LITERATURE GETS,"The person who recommended this book to me was having quite the cruel joke. Such a piece of pretentious tripe I've never experiences before. Characters? Recycled stereotypes so worn that they were passe a decade ago! Plot? Sorry, just an author's hip ego parading from boring page to tedious conclusion."
1,Dumb and dumber,"Comic-book level, this novel is for the post-bubble gum set who never developed a mature understanding or either the world or literature. A waste of time."
1,Worst novel I ever read,"After reading the good reviews, I was devastated when I suffered through See's Handyman. I can't find one merit at all in this fifth-rate mess of attempted literature. Who could possibly rave about this thing? It fails on every level and leaves one with a most sour taste in the mouth."
2,Cardboard characters and fantasy plot,"I feel as though I've read a completely different book from the one given five stars by other readers. The character development was non-existent, the handyman was a totally unrealistic saint-like man. This is basically a Harlequin Romance for middle-aged literate women. Please, a handyman who goes around sleeping with all of his lonely housewife customers. Totally disapoointing and definitely not worth reading."
1,SO DUMB,I couldn't put it down - the gooey treacle of the moronic text stuck to my hands. What a crock this novel is. Save your money folks and just catch the afternoon soaps on TV - they're better done.
5,Where Have All The Good Men Gone?,"Ladies, stop whatever you're doing and read this book. Sexy, steamy, funny, expertly written, charming, I could not put the sucker down. I was reading parts of it out loud to my husband at night and even he was glued to every word."
5,It reads like a great painting...,"A must for every artist whose creativity is stifled. See has the ability to paint a story that allows the reader to visualize the beauty of the paintings similar to the way a reader could hear the music in ""The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love."""
5,The book is a smart and engaging exploration of art in life.,"See's The Handyman is a well crafted novel that explores contemporary life in Los Angeles masterfully. More importantly, she draws attention to the important (and too often neglected) relationship between life and art. The book is as insightful as it is fun. And part of the fun for me was returning to the beginning and rereading the opening fellowship application (that frames the story of the main character's journey) after finishing the entire book once. I was tempted to continue reading the rest of the novel again, too. Yes, it was that good!"
4,"Admits the possibility of happiness, success & goodness.","I didn't read any reviews, had no hyped expectations, just heard See on a radio interview and liked her attitude. In spite of the intellectual disreputability of thinking some people just might be good, she allows for the possibility and thus engenders much of this vitriol from people who think that despair is the only legitimate response from an intelligent mind. Here's one equally disreputable intellectual who agrees with her."
1,FORGET IT!,"If you possess at least an ounce of intelligence, you'll loath this very poorly written novel. Everything about it is aimed for the swallowest of minds. A tedious read and an empty book."
1,A VERY BORING AND POORLY WRITTEN NOVEL !!!,"I REALLY HATED THIS BOOK! THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WAS SO POORLY CONCEIVED AND CAME ACROSS AS PHONEY AND TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE. THE AUTHOR DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO EITHER STRUCTURE AN EFFECTIVELY DRAMATIC AND ENGROSSING PLOT OR COMPOSE A NARRATIVE THAT CAPTURES THE ATTENTION AND INTEREST OF THE READER. I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THE FUSE IS ABOUT. THIS IS A TEDIOUS, DULL, AND ARTIFICIALLY SHALLOW WORK WHICH WILL GREATLY DISAPPOINT ANY LITERATE READER WHO IS EXPECTING ANYTHING ABOVE THE MUNDANE AND TRITE."
1,Disappointing,"I had been waiting to read this book for some time, after a glowing review in the ""Los Angeles Times"" book review section. I found this book very shallow, such a waste of time! After reading a truly great novel like ""White Oleander"" then picking up ""The Handyman"", I felt as if the book was making me brain-dead. I trudged through, however, hoping to find something of substance somewhere...what were the reviewers talking about??!! I enjoyed See's ""Dreaming - hard luck and good times in America"", but will NOT buy another book of hers - it's all library from here on out. Her track record is too unpredictable."
1,1 star is far too kind,"Reading this, I felt my mind congealing into a turd. (No digestion necessary!) A TV dinner for the mind--""meat"" of unnatural shape and texture (I guess it's meat; I mean, it kinda looks like meat), token vegetables, and laden with sodium-rich artifical flavorings.I literally threw this manuscript across the room, effectively ending my stint as a literary scout. It is crap on so many levels--the ""plot,"" the amatuerish and utterly trite crypto-Christo symbology. Jesus! Imagine my surprise--nay, horror--a year or so later, to see this trash win some critical acclaim. Complete madness.Comte was onto something with his ""mental hygiene"" hangup. I'd have my eyes seared with hot pokers before reading something like this again.Oh. And how wonderful to see the author on the MFA/ writing workshop circuit. Behold the future!"
1,A Loser,"This book had it's moments but, overall it is overrated. The author jumps from one character to the next but does not give any depth. The story is implausible. I think the author has something to say about finding your true path, but she hasn't quite figured out how to write this in the context of a novel. I put it down when I got to the last 50 pages."
3,Non Fiction,"A useful intro, but pretty dry. Teach yourself Unix in a week is quite comprehensive, but there is a fair chance that a lot of people will find this pretty boring to slog their way through as it suggests. Still, it will probably do the job, or at least would, if you stick to it as it recommends, at least to that level."
4,Suenos 2- the tutor's perspective,"This is a lively, informative book which takes the student through the more complex grammar and language which Suenos World Spanish established. Along with audio-cassette pack, this is ideal for the self-starter student. For those who need the discipline of a tutor, this is also rewarding but the tutor him/herself could do with a tutor's pack concentrating on the main exercises as per the first book. If I could get hold of this, I could really get down to delivering the standard of lesson this book merits."
1,Be careful. It does not fit Chrysler Town&Country 2001,"The product looks of high quality, unfortunately it did not fit my Chrysler Town&Country 2001 despite a used the ""Find Part"" path starting with the right car make, model and year."
1,Not the right part- not even close,"I needed a pump for 2006 Cobalt and it has a large intake hole.The replacement which their site said would fit, and the picture did look like it, will not work. The picture did not match what I got.No way this will work. This and the unit will not fit in the slot that it is made for either. Waited a week or more to find out. Local stores do not carry, so will have to go to GM and pay a fortune, which is what I should have done and saved all this time wasted. Low price was a sucker buy. Do not trust their site pictures or the function they have that wsays it is the right part!"
3,Works just like the first one.,I selected this pump to replace the first such pump which quit delivering wash fluid to the windshield after about five years. It is the same model number and was an easy replacement (except for climbing under my van's dash upside down) I use distilled water with a small bit of dish detergent in the system. So why did the first pump fail? I took the old one apart and was not impressed with the pump rotor material selected. It failed with not much use? The motor still works fine. I hope I get five years plus out of the replacement (If I still have the van)
2,windshield washer pump,"January 9 / 2013.I still have not recieved it !!!It has been ordered december 9 / 2012 !!!Could you , please , do something ?Murat."
3,Worked once and quit...,Perfect solution for a dead windshield washer...these things usually work like a power washer...just wish I had tested it before I went to the trouble to mount it and hook it up...worked one time and that was it. Things happen...returned and got my refund right away.
5,Easy Installation,I installed this in my daughters Neon this morning and it was a breeze. Everthing you need is included and it took less than an hour to install. Would have took less time if I could have found a sharp drill bit. It works great.
1,Get 25 cards cheaper at other stores,"I regularly pick up a 25 pack of blank cards and envelopes at chain hobby stores for 4.99, and they come in either white or ivory. They're also available online, so don't spend an extra $5 for these; get 'em cheaper elsewhere."
4,Well written but very violent,"Bud Shrake has a great writing style. But, I have to say I found the extreme violence depicted in this book to be offputting. Prior to this novel I read Borderland which surely is his magnum opus. I heartily reccomend Borderland. After you read that novel all else by Shake will pale in comparison."
2,Not the premium reliable product I was hoping for,I purchased this USB to serial adapter to fix lockup issues under high traffic I had with cheaper USB Serial adapters. Amazingly this SIIG devices has the same Prolifc chipset as the cheap adapters so it suffered from the same issues! Serial traffic would stop flowing and only a reboot of the PC or disconnecting the device can clear it.It was simply not reliable for my home automation. Hopefully prolfic will fix this in a driver update but for now the converter is useless to me.I replaced this SIIG adapter with a FTDI based adapter and it has been working flawlessly.I can't recommend this adapter with the current Prolific driver lockup issues.
3,Beautiful but Difficult,"This watch is beautiful! I have very small wrists so a lot of watches look too big and clunky on me. After removing a couple links, this one fits great. The only problem I have with it is that the clasp is extremely difficult to undo. I struggle with it every time I want to take the watch off. I am concerned that the amount of pulling I have to do will weaken the links/clasp, not to mention that it's just plain frustrating trying to get the thing off. As much as I love the way it looks, I'm not sure I would buy it again considering the daily battle of removing it."
5,Beautiful petite watch,"I love this watch! I have a small wrist (about 5.5"") and larger watches never look nice. This watch is tiny and the perfect size for me. It has a few links that you can remove yourself, but I still need to go get 2 more taken out. Amazon shipped quickly, the watch is beautiful and I am very happy."
2,Poor quality on the first two attempts,"I bought this for my wife and she really liked it until the back fell off the watch about 20 minutes after she put it on. We tried to get it back on but couldn't get it to stay. We contacted Amazon and they sent us a replacement out right away (great customer service!). When we received the replacement my wife was very excited to put the new one on, but as soon as she took it out of the package she saw a scratch either on the inside of the glass or on the watch face. We returned that one and we're waiting for the third watch to show up and (fingers crossed) this one will be okay. Thankfully when you buy through Amazon they really take care of the customer. We're hoping the third time is a charm."
2,"Nice Watch, Bad Seller",The watch is nice but it would have been nicer if I didn't have to promptly run to the store to have the battery replaced. Now I know why it was on sale.
2,Not Spectacular,"I tried one of these gadgets several years ago, and it felt magical. This version is a bit cheapy and doesn't give you the same magical flying through space feeling I thought I remembered. Spend $ on a better model that you don't have to bend and shape by hand."
4,Adjusting takes away from the fun,"These are great. They can feel very soothing to some while tickling others. The only complaint I have about these are that you need to bend them into shape. I would prefer that they automatically open up into the circle. Otherwise, I would buy these again."
3,Head tinglers for two.,"The only negative thing I would have to say about these particular head tinglers is that you have to bend them into shape. They don't naturally open into a circle. Other than that, they do the job! I kept one for myself, and took the other to a party for a gift exchange! The red velvet bag was a nice added feature!"
2,"Interesting idea, but ultimately unconvincing","First, I have to give Jones credit for the imagination behind his premise. It's a very interesting one, with (on the surface) a lot of potential. But -- and you knew there had to be a ""but"", since I gave the book a mere two stars --The book is dry, dull, and finally unconvincing. It reads like a doctoral dissertation rather roughly adapted for the general interest audience. And while Jones might be onto something *within one or two very specific cultural contexts* (e.g., China and Africa), in the main, I think he's very wrong to suggest this anthropological patchwork, where dragons are an amalgam of the eagle, leopard, and snake. No, I have to agree with B. Boesenberg that dragons (at least, the European variety) are really just snakes ""with wild imaginings attached""."
2,strange times,"An absolutely bizarre mix of songs. No theme or concept at all, except that they charted as ""Pop Hits"" in the early 80s. There are some terrific tunes by Moon Martin and Steve Forbert, and pleasant offerings from the Dirt Band (minus the Nitty Gritty) and J.D. Souther. But then we are subjected to the likes of Rupert Holmes, Captain & Tennille and Michael Johnson ... which comes close to torture in my opinion. And then ... Bernadette Peters? Who thinks up these odd compilations? And why would anyone want to listen to this the entire way through? No wonder the music industry lost the plot."
1,Not even worth 5 bucks!,"I thought this book would help understand how to change the settings (Shutter speed, F stops etc) quickly on the Canon Rebel, instead it shows you the very very basics of how to change picture types (Auto, P, Macro), format your CF card and very simple other things.I would stick to the manual which shows you just as much and more then this book and save $5."
4,"Thoughtful, helpful advice for midlife sex","Dr. Altman provides down to earth, helpful advice to readers which includes psychological, behavioral and medical suggestions. If you are anti any type of medication, than this probably is not the book for you. If, however, you believe that your sex problems might not merely be ""in your head"" you will probably find this book informative and useful."
3,Win98 Detection Issues,"Don't get me wrong, this jobbie detects/works great on win2k and winxp but when it comes to win98, there's a bit more work involved. The installation cd installs the drivers but you must manually find the file through ""Display List of Drivers"" when win98 fails to detect the proper drivers. Select ""Hard Disk Controllers"". Choose ""Sandisk Cruzer Driver"" It'll find a file called ""pusbata.inf"". Now you're set in win98.I could not figure this out for a few days since most modern usb components install much more easily than this.Because of this win98 annoyance, I downgrade this to a 3. Hopefully this helps someone and gives them a reason to boost the score..."
4,It's bigger than a USB drive.,"I was surprised how large it was when it arrived-- about 3 1/4 by 1 3/4 by 3/4 inches. I was expecting a cute little USB drive, but this is more like a compact SD card reader. It is a pocketfull all by itself, so I won't be able to add it to any of my pockets. It doesn't say anything about USB 2.0."
3,May Not Work With XP,"The Cruzer works on one of my laptops running XP, and used to work on my other laptop when it ran Windows 98 (2nd Edition). But when I upgraded the second laptop to XP, the Cruzer stopped working with it. The computer simply does not recognize the presence of the device. The Sandisk Web site contains no useful information about this problem and is pretty inadequate in general. Too bad, because the product, when it works, is quite good and can be a convenient alternative to Zip disks."
2,Confusing description,"While this item was reasonably priced, the description mislead me. When this item came up in my Gold Box offers, I read over the description, and came away thinking it was a pocket sized, USB plug-and-play reader for CompactFlash memory cards, which I own because they are used by my digital camera. When I received the item, I realized that it actually uses the miniature flash cards, about the size of a postage stamp. I would NOT have ordered this item if the description was clear, since I do not currently own any devices that use this type of memory card."
2,1 Big Flaw,"While this would seem to be a cool way to transfer information between different computers and even a PDA, the Cruzer is too deep and wide to fit properly in most USB ports. If you have a typical computer (i.e., a keyboard and mouse connector and below it 2 USB ports), the Cruzer does not fit in the USB port if the keyboard and mouse are plugged in. It also doesn't fit if a USB device is plugged in, as it is too ""fat"". You must use a 4"" dongle that comes with it to plug it into such places, that dongle is easily lost, and the dongle does not easily fit into the carrying case that comes with the product.In principle, it works well. But in practice, being too bulky and not plugging into the usb port at the back of a typical computer without the aid of additional, easily lost parts is a real drag. You'd be better off with a smaller memory key-like device, or if you have a PDA or camera, it's a lot cheaper just to buy a data cable instead."
3,Needs Refinement and has poor tech support,"Purchased the 128MB Cruzer at Circuit City for [$$$]. I do tech support on a lot of W98/W2K desktops and I thought this would be perfect for carrying around utility software instead several different CD's. It works fine on W2K, but the (incomplete) manual says one must install the driver for W98. I've tried on 2 different boxes, and even downloaded the latest driver from their poorly designed website. No luck - it only works on W2K. Was on hold to CA tech support 10 minutes and I finally hung up. Works great on Windows 2000. Consider a different brand."
5,"No drivers, no power supply, and Mega Memory","Cool tool. Works well in MAC environment and no drivers needed. I like the fact that memory is expandable via SD memory cards. Not as slim-line and self-contained as Sony Micro Vault but it plugs into MAC keyboard just fine. In case you are working in tight USB places, SanDisk includes a 3.5 inch plug-in cable. A neoprene case is also provided. Very transportable and well worth the money."
5,SanDisk Pocketable Flash Drive,"Right out of the box the Cruzer worked perfectly for me. Transported an entire card full with our favorite photos and copied them over to my father-in-law's PC (Windows XP) without a hitch, then copied his own favorite digital photos back to my card to take home.I plan to use the Cruzer to carry larger PowerPoint presentations for work. It is ideal for this and allows slides to be updated and resaved. Much easier than carrying the entire laptop around."
5,excellent!,"Worked great out of the box! Loaded the driver on a Win98 laptop and was dragging and dropping files in minutes! On the Win2k laptop no driver needed! Instant access. I take files to work, back home, everywhere. Just slip the puppy in my pocket. One small problem. You will have to use the 3"" extension cord in most situations, I only wish they would have put a storage pocket on the carrying case for the extension cable. Other than that thumbs up on this item.."
5,3M Microfiber,We own a ZAGG invisibleshield store and these are the best for cleaningiPhones and all other electronics. Great for Installof our product.
4,Does a good job but notice the size,"This cloth appears to be the same material as the largerMicrofiber Electronics Cleaning Cloth, also by 3M, but is significantly smaller. This cloth is a handy size to keep in a pocket for cleaning glasses, but the larger cloth works better for me in a camera bag for cleaning lenses and filters."
5,They are the best for cleaning glasses,I love this product. I already have this but needed more and wanted to give them to some of my friends. I also use the larger ones for cleaning the house.
2,Don't Like Them,They don't work on glasses and leave streaks. I don't like them in general as they are not soft enough and seem coarse.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM!!,"I ordered two, one for me, one for my little girl. Easy enough for a child to use and cleans perfectly."
5,"works well, delivered quickly",This is a cloth for cleaning glasses that I keep in my briefcase. It works well.
1,Not good for vision glasses,"This item is definitly not good for cleaning your vision glasses. The texture of the cloth is not smooth and as a consequence, it can't clean correctly your glasses. Usually your glasses are even more dirty after using it than before...Don't buy this product!"
3,A lot smaller than I expected.,I read the dimensions before buying but did not judge how small this item was until I received it.Not worth it in my opinion.
4,Nice cloth,"These aren't bad cleaning cloths. I hadn't bought any before, so I wasn't sure which to go with, but this is good for the price. I would buy this product again. Though you should note that you may need to wash it before you use it, as some small fibers came off the cloth and onto my glasses, but works well after washed."
4,Good value,The cloth is of a good size and does a great job of wiping the screens of my electronics.I like the material.I don't care for the plastic sleeve. The sticky strip gets caught when inserting/removing the cloth.
4,First impressions are good...,"... I purchased this item to remove some debris off my camcorder lens and found it to do the job very nicely.The microfiber texture feels nice - a little beady, but soft and textured.Using it was easy, I just wiped the lens in a circular fashion with light pressure and eventually the debris was gone. (some fingerprints and what appeared to be a scratch but wasn't)The packaging is a little subpar though. It comes in a plastic bag which you tear open at the bottom to slide the cloth out. However doing so leaves adhesive residue, which the cloth then sticks to and you have to tear it off, making those sections of the cloth appear phyically different - a bit roughed up I'd say. This is poor design as the packaging says to store the cloth inside the bag when not in use to avoid contamination, so I used a scissor to cut the bottom of the bag with the adhesive residue off.I've yet to machine wash it, but so far it works well. It's just a cheap lens cleaning cloth after all."
1,Fatal Flaw - 3M Lens Cleaner,"This product has been renamed to 3M Lens & Electronics Microfiber Cleaning Cloth - the ""& Electronics"" part is new. It used to be the best product for cleaning eyeglasses - mine have an anti-glare/anti-reflective coating and the old cleaning cloths did a wonderful job of cleaning them. I bought 5 more for myself and for stocking stuffers at Christmas, and along with the new name, there apparently is a new formulation because they now leave tiny specks all over my glasses which have to be WASHED OFF. I called 3M ""customer service"" directly about this and the young lady at the other end of the line was cutesy, apologetic, but clueless - and didn't even offer a refund or replacement (I did not ask for one - that's their job the way I look at it). Too bad to lose such a great product."
1,"Leaves lint behind, don't buy","This cleaning cloth leaves lint behind. The more you clean your lens with it, the dirtier your lens becomes. DON'T BUY! I would rate it zero."
4,Perfect but short,"For a 2-1/2 year old enjoying his first real holiday season (too young last year), this was perfect but it is very short. His Mom is Jewish and dad Christian. Like many families they have menorah, tree and stockings."
4,Hot diggity!,"If you like Americana, kitsch, truly down to earth people and places, you'll enjoy ""A Hot Dog Show."" You'll want to immediately go out to your local hot dog vendor and scarf down your favorites. Our four year old daughter loved it, especially seeing the hot dogs shooting out of the machine!! A fun video."
1,Misleading,I thought I was getting the new Public Enemies movie with Johnny Depp and here it was some old movie that I didn't care about.
4,A different type of thriller,"Pascual March is an unlikely hero, a Catalan who joined and later betrayed the PLO, he now lives in semi poverty in Barcelona hiding from his former allies. He is contacted by French intelligence with an offer he cannot refuse, come to Paris and identify a former terrorist and earn $100,000 or we will tell the PLO where you are. The result is complex and bloody tale involving the Russian secret service and the various factions of the Algerian civil war.Different, well plotted and written Mr Martell has written two other novels featuring March, we can only hope he will get round to writing a few more."
1,Disappointing,"This book is neither historical or factual, yet it would like to infer such. This is partial, if not complete, fiction. Recognizing this, one immediately loses interest in this dreary subject matter. Disappointing, a complete waste of time."
3,5 stars for the photos - none for the editing,"Schiffer Publishing's books, in general, suffer from the same malady -- poor editing. This one, although it presents some beautiful art jewelry pieces we would not see otherwise, was in need of an editorial scrub before it went to press.If we overlook the errors, we'll see Cynthia Toops's wild polymer pin/pendant ""Havoc on the Food Chain."" David C. Freda's ""Stag Beetles, Grubs, and Raspberries"" is a fantasy in silver, 24k and 18k gold, and glass enamel. Harriet Berman uses recycled tin UPC codes to make beads. Revel in what you see in the pictures and try to ignore the sloppiness of the publisher."
4,Printing errors but fabulous pictures,"This is a wonderful reference book just for the photos of the jewelry. However, there are numerous errors in the printing/editing of this book: the descriptions of many pieces of the pictured jewelry have been mixed up, and one chapter on techniques is cut short in the middle of a sentence. Buy this book for the marvelous photos and innovative work but read with care."
4,Cool disc,"This is a cool disc, and has by far the best set of tracks of any of Blockhead's work. I got turned on to him from listening to Aesop Rock's early stuff and loving the beats almost more than the rhymes. I picked up 4 blockhead albums right away.. listened to all of them.. and this is by far the best. This one has some funky tracks that will stick with you."
3,Pleasing but not very convincing,"Often engaging though rarely exceptional, these edgy background beats register rarely past enjoyably competent when glanced at full view repeatedly."
2,bought for Gerbils,"I was disappointed with this purchase. 1st off, the house did not stay open in the bottom of the cage, where it was intended for. It closes, the side with the window in the image folds into the side with the door causing the house to be completely unusable. Secondly, the item did not come as pictured. In the picture there is a cute little window in the side house. The one that we received had no side window. Our 10 gallon tank has a cage topper and we ended up putting it at the very top level, right next to the food dish. It's just the right hight to stay wedged in the open position right next to their food. I gave it 2 stars instead of one since the gerbils use it a little. They grab a bite to eat from their bowl and then run inside and eat it. Every now and then, they will take a nap inside of it as well. Still, I would not buy this again or recommend it to anyone except if you want to use it for playtime but it will not work at all in the bottom of a cage."
5,Review from HustleBear.com by Judd Weiss,"Amazing. This is my favorite ambient album. Gorgeous detailed electronic soundscapes with subtle pulsing energy and a post rock flare. Even has elements of deep bass dub. Great to fall asleep to, read to, relax to. I could listen to this album on constant repeat in headphones everyday as I go about life."
4,Very Soothing,"Nice Album! Very peaceful textures that are perfect for relaxing/Yoga/Meditation etc. I would not consider this New Age, it's more modern Ambient with some modern electronics. There are quite a bit of interesting sounds here even guitars. The product description here says: ""a Manchester duo, follow suit on a CD that travels in cinematic melancholy and textural malaise. Their songs build slowly, emerging out of a flattened landscape of static and stillness to attain a quietly triumphal beauty. Percussion is almost subliminal in journeys that pulse more than groove"" I think that is a very good way of describing this album. Good Stuff."
5,re: Celestial Melodies Great Work Album,"This album resonates with beauty... the music provides you with a very thought provoking journey. If you want to transcend your current time and place, just put this album on and you will be transported by the delicate yet etheral melodies.. it is an album with tremendous beauty. I cannot recommend a album more, it relaxes me and gives me insight into what I am doing. Absolutely fantastic album to listen to while at work..."
3,Great for kids.,"This little hardcover book has patterns for using needlepoint stitches on plastic canvas. Small and larger projects, potted flowers, pincusion, scissors holder and more. These things would be well suited for the budding needlepointer child who is just starting out. There is a pattern for a standup doll, picture frames, a butterfly. A nice little book, but nothing too fancy."
3,JIFFY POP!,"RADIO DAZE-POP HITS OF THE 80'S VOL.5: A tone-kool mix of adult contemporary pop from the 80's, (though it will hardly leave anyone ""dazed"") the fifth installment from Rhino's reissue series contains the usual handful of guilty pleasures.

5,A Cup of comfort for Friends,Purchased one for myself and decided it was the perfect gift for special friends as I enjoyed it very much.
1,Waiting for nothing,No longer availablo if the product is not in stock and no longer availaiblo why loose my time waiting for a product that they- do not have ?
2,Satisfactory,A lot of different puzzles beside crossword. This was a gift and recipient said some of the puzzles were really hard. Wouldn't purchase again.
4,Everything..even goof ups!!,"Not a bad puzzle book really, maybe not as good as some others but Ok nonetheless. However, they skimped on proofing I think, as the easy crossword puzzles are listed as the medium and vice-versa. A little discombobulating!"
1,Poor quality,"Poor printing quality makes this hard to read. Also,the EASY crosswords are actually MEDIUM and the MEDIUM crosswords are actually EASY. Others have noticed this but it's never been corrected. The DIFFICULT crosswords are so small it's impossible to write a letter in the box, thats if you can read the clue or box number with the type size and blurry printing. Avoid this piece of ----."
3,only for crossword lovers,"this is a great book. you must be an extreme crossword lover. i give it a three because all the puzzles are just too hard for me, not including the find the word. a little unfair rating, but it just wasn't what i expected. i wanted to see at least one suduko puzzle."
4,Great Puzzle Book!,The book is great. The reason why I am rating this book four stars instead of five is that the book came with the cover bent. It made the book look used. This is a bit disappointing when I ordered it new as a gift for someone else.
4,Great specifics on the breed but a bit frightening at times!,"I would have given this book 5 stars were it not for all the ""doom and gloom"" sidebars about the numerous horrible things that happened to various Yorkies--usually at the hand of their owners. I am researching this breed in the hopes of buying a puppy and I found this book very intimidating and discouraging at times due to all these gloomy references. Having talked to many Yorkie owners/breeders, I don't get the impression that these dogs are as fragile and picky as portrayed in this book. Negatives aside, this book seems to outline very clearly the most important details and caveats that really set the Yorkies apart from other breeds. For that, I am thankful."
5,My Yorkie Bible!,"I have almost every Yorkie book on the market and Sandy's book Yorkies Head to Tail is referenced the most. I need to purchase a second as my first one is wearing out. If you own a Yorkie this book is a must have. Very thorough completely covering all aspects of buying, raising, training and caring for your Yorkie! By far the best Yorkie book out there today."
1,they were working perfect and then the lights stopped working! they are installed and they are pieces of junk now!!!,"Yea thats right the lights stopped working, checked everything and well, the LED's dont work, what a shame job, work for awhile and then they stop just great.....................and I bought them for that reason, my friends stopped working too"
2,Drive ok Tech help is the pits,"Short and sweet. Easy to install_however had to call tech help in Inda and spent 4 yes 4 hours fixing one problem. The tech help person was polite but knew very little about computers. Also, couldn't record old vcr tapes."
3,Just didn't work for me,"This product just didn't work with my two computers. Wasted a bunch of DVD media trying to burn data DVDs. I didn't even try capturing part yet. Also, a wasted USB 2.0 upgrade.Software installation was extremely annoying. It insisted that I should have enough space on my C: drive (where my OS resides) without even giving me an opportunity to specify a different drive. After making enough room in C: drive, it gave me an option to choose a drive to install. Whatever happened to software quality control?The product is really an internal DVD drive enclosed in a shell. It doesn't feel robust. The coating on the casing is not uniform and generally gave me a bad feeling.I encountered a lot of errors during data DVD burning process, but none of them are self explanatory. I had to guess the reasons.Bottomline, I could not burn even a single DVD succesfully, using this product."
2,gives too much problem,"It does the work but if you're not using it you better shut it off because most of the times I restart the PC its driver causes the PC to hang. Or sometimes it doesn't wait for a restart and it says it can't get anything from the video recorder or VHS. The problem is known by HP because it gives a solution in their support site. It says to shut it off (it doesn't have an on/off button so you have to unplug it from the wall!), unplug the USB and restart the PC!And by now you better wait for the dual layer recorders."
2,Don't Buy It,"The hardware is good, the software is very very bad. Even with tech support it still crashes half the time it prepares to burn a dvd (but only after it's spent a lot of time preparing the image). I'm returning it tonight."
1,Bad product,"This is the worst product HP has ever invented. After installing a brand new product, I was able to make 2 DVD's. The software that came with it wasn't very user friendly though. And then when I made DVD copies, it got stuck 2 times. Then even with technical support, the system keeps crashing and freezing while I'm burning. Then it showed a ""Code 10"" which means there is a malfunction in the HP hardware and tech support even said that he expected it! So he suggested to have it exchanged. And I did. Then with the newly-opened-from-the box hardware, I was able to burn 2 dvd's and then it malfunctioned again. I already wasted several dvd-r's worth $2 each just trying to get the movie writer to work. Don't buy this. It doesn't work. The one star rating is for the 2 dvd's I burned after opening it from the box. Other than that, it's a waste of time, money, and effort!!!"
1,Don't waste your time.....,"I bought this after much soul searching about what product to buy to transfer my old VHS tapes to digital. It was awful and I had plenty of memory (512mb) with a 2600+AMD processor. It started off just fine but for no reason it would just suddenly stop right in the middle of the transfer.... I tried it over and over. Same thing. I wrapped it up and took it right back. I purchased a Pioneer DVR-520H DVD recorder, hooked it up to my very old VCR, put in a very old VHS tape and it recorded it beautifully. Don't waste your time with this thing...the manual gives you easy instructions to set it up..BUT- if you have a problem with it forget it! The manual mainly gives you phone #'s to call..nothing to troubleshoot with. The Pioneer is easy to operate, and works like a charm."
1,Software a problem,"I saw that some were having problems with drivers in reviews but I hadn't had trouble with HP products before so I thought I would give the product a try, it was a big mistake! After many hours of work I managed to get my computer back online. I though for a time this product had made my hard drive inaccesable. I make my living off my computer and can't afford to destroy it with a faulty product."
2,"Works sometimes, Arcsoft software not good","I bought this recently and I am not too happy with this product. It is easy to setup and works most of the time (with XP). However, it may decide to stop working by giving this error - No video signal detected. Powering it off/on and restarting the Arcsoft software (which is pathetic) makes it work again. I called HP tech support (somewhere in India), they asked me to re-install the driver. I re-installed the Arcsoft software since the USB 2.0 driver is already part of XP. No luck.Also, using the S-Video cable makes the device or the arcsoft software not too friendly (video signal not detected problems)I also upgraded to a USB 2.0 PC card but burning a DVD takes the same time as using USB 1.1. Not sure what else needs to be done.In short, buy it if you just want to capture video from your old camcorder and burn straight to DVD. Forget editing the captured video."
4,Detailed primer,This is an excellent primer to the world of T-bonds arbitrage. The discussions are comprehensively detailed and written in daylight clarity. All vital analyses about treasury securities are elucidated concisely in a unified context. The author has a clear philosophical mindset and draws the reader's attention to areas beyond technical details. Clear buy recommended by a practicing trader.
5,Simplicity Itself,"Terry Belton's contributions to this work are nothing short of tremendous. His unique ability to present advanced financial concepts in a meaningfully clear and concise framework is refreshing. Belton has successfully walked the fine line by creating a multifaceted text for both the fixed income neophyte as well as the experienced risk arbitrageur. While his detailed analytical and insightful discussions prove to be a pragmatic resource for investment professionals trying to manage their exposure to interest rate risk, his clarity allows the text to be a valued resource to students and beginners. A recommended strong buy for all people involved with fixed income markets."
4,Wonderful,"The music on this CD is heartbreakingly beautiful. The performance is excellent and so is the recording quality. My only (very minor) complaint is that the whole thing is presented as a single 54-minute track, so it's hard to listen to small segments of it."
3,Title is extremely misleading,"This is very good book if you're looking for a quick history of trade and exploration of the New World prior to the entrance of Columbus on the world stage. If you're looking for anything remotely referencing of Templar Knights in the New World, this book doesn't even come close. It is interesting reading, raises questions about ""who was first"" and gives documented evidence of ""who was first"", but readily admits that the Templars where ""extinct"" by the time these voyages were made."
5,Outstanding Book,I am a Mason and this book was very helpful to me. It describes the Templar visits to America before Columbus. In fact Columbus bore the Templar Cross on his ships and his father in law was a Mason. It describes the Vikings routes to America before Columbus and the Zeno Narrative of travels with Henry Sinclair. I am also a student of Scottish History and i find it most credible that they discovered America first. Sinclair was involved with Templars and the Masons. The book is an eye opener and rewrites history with compelling evidence - Newport Tower and Westford Knight grave stone. I don't know when schools will teach this stuff but it needs to be soon.
3,This is a wonderful book for profiles of baseball players.,"This book is not about baseball statistics. It is about ballplayers and it has profiles of all sorts of ballplayers from the famous to the forgotten. It is a great reference for readers who want to know something about an Ike Boone, or a Buzz Arlett. Or something about the career of Ted Williams or a Mudcat Grant. This book, however, is flawed. It has mistakes that it should not have such a ignoring Bob Gibson's 1964 WS victory and then saying that Mudcat Grant in 1965 was the first black pitcher to win a WS game. Still it overcomes it flaws and provides profiles of the great and the not so great."
4,A Classic In Need of an Update,"This massive volume is the best desk reference book of its type available. It is laudable in its breadth and depth, covering even those players whose careers may have been brief but in some way noteworthy. Its primary shortcoming is its age. It simply needs to be updated."
3,"Over-priced, but a good read","I was required to purchase this book at LSU for a class. It contains great information, but like many books chosen by professors it is sorely over-priced for information that can be learned from much cheaper reference books. Lose two stars for ripping off poor students."
5,The First Networking Book I owned,This was the first networking book I bought when I was still in school. The book is good and helped me setup my first network at home. I am writing my review today even though they already moved up two more editions.
3,Decent but Outdated,"The layout of this book could have used some work, and I understand the later editions do a better job, but it nevertheless provided a foundation of networking and datacomm principles. The material is out of date, so since there is a newer edition out, I would recommend it over this edition."
2,Weak points too strong,"I agree with the other reviewers that the material is basically presented well, but that this book is outdated and too expensive for the presentation of a fairly humble amount of information. I would like to add two points. First, this book shares an all too common problem with IT books in that an editor should have taken another look at this book to catch the numerous grammar errors (notably in subject/verb agreement) and redundant passages. Second, this book has a fictional case study scenario at the end of every chapter. I found these to be poorly thought-out and not particularly helpful, especially when compared to the very informative, well-chosen actual case studies to which the authors did not devote enough time. I suggest teachers use a different book."
1,A Lousy Read,We used this text in my data networking class and I'm discovering what a poor choice it was for the subject of computer networks. This most recent edition is embarrassingly behind in Internet technology details. The book is physically almost half the size of other texts on this subject--a clue to its scarcity of information.Take a big pass on this one and complain to your instructor if your see it listed for a class you're about to take.
3,way behind its times,"This book is very detailed and a novice in the telecommunications field will understand it. The diagrams are very clear and easy to understand. Now the bad part. It was published in 1996 which means all the data is from 1995. This book is being used at San Jose State University but only for the next semester (Fall '98), which hopefully means a new version will be coming out. The telecommunications industry is changing every time you see the Cal Trans guys digging up the road installing new cables and wires!!"
2,Leather check book,"Although this is a nice leather check book cover, the plastic flap that goes between duplicate checks is short and doesn't cover all the writing area of the checks. Since I use duplicates, it's annoying and I've had to cut a piece of cardboard to use it in order to use my checks the way they are intended to be used. Of course, with a loose piece of cardboard, the cardboard falls out, gets lost, etc. I bought this specific leather cover since it was supposed to accommodate duplicate checks. Unfortunately, it doesn't do the job. If you don't use duplicates, you will like this product, but skip it if you use duplicates."
1,Cheaper than it looks but ok,"There is a pen holder right at the edge where you normally put in the check register for some reason, i had to cut it off to get the register in. decent other than that."
3,Bigger than I was expecting,"Nice size. It looked a bit more inexpensive than I was expecting but for the price, I won't complain. I do think the shipping charges were expensive (I ordered this along with checkbook inserts)."
1,Hate it,"More for a man than a woman, stiff and hard to fold in half after putting checks inside, now what I expected"
4,checkbook cover,Very nice product. The only drawback is that you cannot close the cover if youhave a pen in the pen holder.
2,"Adequite, but poorly made","I purchased this to replace my 30 year old wallet. It held all my information, my credit cards, my ""other"" cards such as NRA membership and drivers license fairly well.The problem I discovered is that when they sewed in the plastic sheathing used to seperate checks they were off by some 2/3"" of an inch- that doesn't sound like much until you write a check and it goes through 3 or 4 other checks making a mess.I didn't return it because it'd cost just as much to replace it by shipping charges as it would to complain. So heres the straight dope on it- don't buy it, poorly made."
5,Great for the price.,"If you want a fancy designer checkbook cover that this is not for you. But if you want something decent looking to protect you checks, then the price can't be beat. Leather is sturdy and construction quality is acceptable. There were a few blemishes in the leather that are hard to notice."
3,Too small,"I put a normal (non-duplicate) book of checks in here and it barely closes. Looks nice, but is way too tight. Too cheap to return, but would not buy again."
5,Great Product,I was in need of a new checkbook cover because my dog chewed my previous one. I was very pleased with the quality and price of the checkbook cover - a must buy!
1,"Come on, can someone make a usable checkbook?","I just want a nice, leather checkbook. How hard can that be to find? This one looks nice enough, but it doesn't work! The plastic divider for the duplicate checks is too small. It doesn't fully cover the check below so the pen punches through the paper as you write. Terrible. And for such a small error. Just make the plastic separate a little bigger."
2,Bob Dylan Encylopedia,"Somewhat fun to browse...but fails as an authoritative ""Encyclopedia"" given the strongly opinionated content, the numerous inaccuracies, and the often baffling level of relative attention given to its subjects (the entry for Gene Simmons - yes, that Gene Simmons - is longer than that for ""Blonde on Blonde"")."
3,Some key personalities in the Spanish Civil War,This book looks at American pilots who were recruited by the Republicans early in the Spanish Civil War to fly against the Nationalists. Although this book has some good information it bounces around a lot. Not only that but it also seems to be obsessed with a specific Nationalist pilot that it keeps referring to. The formatting is inconsistent and confusing at places (I'm not sure in some spots if I'm looking at a direct quote from Tinker or not). A singular resource for this type of information.
4,It was exciting!,"This book was realistic and fun and kept the kids attention as well as my own. A good, fun scare and interesting story with surprises."
5,watching this made me a fan,I already liked Jon Fitch before but watching this made me even more of his fan. Watch it and you'll agree.
4,surprise,This is an excellent read. Pinegars' writing really grows on you making the book hard to put down. I honestly found myself laughing out-loud with his off-the-wall punch lines. I would entirely enjoy seeing the pieces performed.
5,Clean table when eating out!,This product is fantastic. My toddler uses her plate as a frisbee when in a restaurant. So this allows me to eliminate the plate and use the table - no germs! It's also great for keeping her busy while we wait for the food to arrive. There are pictures of all the Sesame Street characters and she loves them!
2,What a waste of $$$...,My son also rips these right off the table. He is almost 11 months old so hopefully he will do better with them when he is older (fortunately I only bought the 20 pack). This is a great idea in theory but for my curious son it is not practical. I am back to using my antibacterial wipes to clean the table off which is the only effective method that I have found so far.Update: I have recently found two alternatives of this same concept that have worked out well. The local Dollar Tree sells their own version of table toppers that cling quite well (pack of 8 for $1) and the Hippopatamus brand that Target sells that have great educational themes of ABCS and numbers 1-10. These wrap around the edge of the table and cover more area than the previously reviewed brand.
2,OK PRODUCT - BUT HAS STICKY PROBLEMS,"This product was great when my daughter was between 6 months and 12 months old. But now that she's 13 months, she would rather pull the topper up and play with it. My husband keeps one hand one side of it and I keep my hand on the other side of it while we're eating - otherwise she pulls them off (sometimes she still manages to do so). I agree with other comments that it would be better if the sticky stuff were on all four sides, not just the top and the bottom. I have found that at this point, the topper is useless for us."
5,Great for dining out,"We just love these things and always keep some in our diaper bag for our twins.They really stay put and stick right to the table. We've also used them at friend's houses, just make sure it's ok to stick the adhesive on the table.I buy these for shower gifts now as part of a feeding theme gift."
3,Will not buy again,"The idea is a good one. However, I may have gotten a ""bum"" pack. The adhesive strip on one side has been stuck to the mat on almost every single one (they are folded up). When you go to unstick it, it tears a hole across the whole mat. Also, my 11 month old seems more interested in trying to rip it off the table than eating his food. Like I said, it's a great idea, just maybe need better quality."
2,No Good for a curious baby,"I loved the idea of this for my very curious 10 month old baby boy. He is very independent and loves to feed himself. I don't really like the idea of him eating off of a high chair that countless other children have used, so I bought these table toppers. What a waste of money. He immediatly tore it off of the table and threw it on the floor. I had it tight with no bubbles to draw extra attention, but he's not easily fooled. I wish that someone would come up with something that can't be torn off so easily."
4,A must have for eating out with toddlers!,"I am not a neat freak but the thought of my toddler eating of tables that look like they haven't been cleaned in who knows how long really grossed me out. We tried using plates but that is usually short lived with my son. These are the perfect solution. I always keep a few in my diaper bag. My one complaint is that out of my pack of 50, about 12 were defective and coulnd't be used. Don't know if anyone else has had this issue."
4,Have kids? Have these!,"If you EVER eat out with your toddler, you need to invest in these mats. It used to disgust me to see parents wipe off a table at a restaurant and then put their chid's food directly on the table. You don't realize how unsanitary that is. These mats quickly adhere to the table, typically stay put, and provide for clean-up.I deducted a star, because sometimes, just sometimes, I am fumbling so much trying to remove the covers for the adhesive that my child starts getting a little rowdy because he's ready for his food. Also, my son likes to try to pull the placemat off the table. For the most part, he fails. But, he'll occasionally get a good pull on it and end up knocking something over.But, overall it's a great product."
2,This just isn't Walt...,"If you are a fan of Wanderley's trademark sixties organ-bossa sound, avoid this cd at all costs! Though the liner notes do not indicate the recording date, it is clear from the pictire inside, as well as the nausea-inducing presence of a cheap ARP synthesizer, that this was recorded sometime in the eighties! Not that this would automatically make it awful; it's just awful period. The group DOES hit some nice grooves occasionally, but Walt's unmistakeable organ sound has all but vanished in place of a smoother, more homogonized tone that could just as easily come out of a Casio keboard; in additon, all the percussion sounds exceedingly bright to the point of annoyance. Over all, this collection completely lacks pretty much everything that makes the rest of Walt's work enjoyable. For die-hard completists only."
3,You infuriate me!,"This volume of The Spirit Archives covers the first half of 1945. Spirit creator (and genius of the comic book artform) was in the army at the time, so the comics were written and drawn by other people. They are decent comics, but the ones done by Eisner himself are much better."
5,Baby Basics,"Dr. Baskerville's ""Baby Basics"" is a common sense approach to caring for babies and toddlers. She answers many questions new parents ask in a way that is easy to understand and to carry out. I am a labor/delivery nurse and am in a position of answering many of these same questions from new parents before I send them home with their babies. I am so happy to have a book like this to refer to and I happily recommend it to my patients. I am buying a copy for each of my own children to use as they become parents for the first time or even if they already have a child. There should be more manuals like this for parents. Thank you Dr. Baskerville."
3,"Battery life not great, but not biggest problem","The battery life is more like 6-7 hours rather than the 11 hours advertised however, this is not my biggest problem with the JB3. I too was cheated by Creative of my $50 rebate. For this reason, I will never purchase from them again. The Jukebox 3 is adequate, however, as pointed out, tracks on the Jukebox cannot be transferred to a hard drive or another player. This is a major shortcoming, in my opinion. Mainly, I think that Creative has sowed an awfully bad crop by cheating so many customers of their rightful and promised rebates."
4,Going Mobile,"Ordered this base for my Delta Unisaw and arrived undamaged.and after searching, Amazon had by far the lowest price. Like all HTC products this went together without any problems or missing items and is very well made. only one small modifacation I had to do was to shim the Unisaw with a small piece of wood between the base and the saw to keep it from sliding from side to side about 3/8 of an inch. Better to have a slightly larger base than to find out its fraction too small with a 450lbs+ Cabinet saw hanging in the air."
3,Ok,Pretty good book. I remember this from when I was younger and reading it. Nice plot and nice suspense. Nice ending too although it was kind of freaky for half siblings to marry :-/
3,cute romance,"For an Harlequin novel, this book pretty much fit the bill. However, two things bothered me. First was Emma's father's codicil that she had to marry her stepbrother AND have a baby with him - I am sorry, but what kind of will is that? It's a terrible one, and for a man who was supposed to have loved his daughter so much, he passed this requirement! Feh. I mean, even though they were not blood-related, they still shared the same half-sister who stood to gain the entire property if the will was not fulfilled.Second was the person behind the mischief. Though the author tried to hide it, I actually figured out who it was a while before it happened, so it was rather predictable. It's okay as a fluff read, but if more thought had been given to the storyline, it would have been more memorable."
5,Amazing show,"Such an amazing show.I am not a tv watcher, But I LOVE this show.I have watched it since it started, And I have loved every episode.Each season it gets better."
2,condition of dvd,"I love the series Bones, but I was not really happy with the DVD I received ... I relized it was a pre owned but there were quit a few glitches on the disks.... I think from now on I will buy new.."
5,Great show.,"Great characters, excellent plots. The picture quality is almost Blue Ray quality and the sound it great. The extras are nice too."
4,Goodness,This was a very good copy of an excellent show. It arrived quickly and was packaged well to protect it from damage.
5,Everything I could ask for,"I was looking for the newest season of this amazing show for my girlfriend for Christmas, and I found it on Amazon for so much cheaper than any of the stores around. I was hoping it would be brand new and not a used copy or something, but I was pleasantly surprised when it came and it was brand spanking new. My girlfriend was so happy and she was waiting to get it for so long. Thanks for the great purchase."
4,Bones : The complete 5 season,"We love this series, but on the last disc there is a scratch that does make it skip a small section. Over all I am happy with my purchase."
5,Great except for one thing......,"I agree with Phoenix Child in almost every detail. Bones is a wonderfully crafted show that shows terrific character development and incredible plot development as well as being inspirational to viewers as a testimony to science ""squints"". However, I have serious irritation issues with Daisy and spend many minutes each episode missing Zach. Wendell was good in the role of assistant, but the others were annoying and Daisy was absolutely nauseating. I kept wanting to slap her into the reality of being aware of others' feelings. How can Sweets be sweet on this girl? I so hope they can figure out a way of bringing Zach back. I wait with bated breath for season six to begin!"
4,Good but too short!,"I love this series and I very much enjoyed this season's story line - pregnancy, new baby, fugitive. Why were there only 13 shows? I must have missed the memo."
5,Love the show and LOOOOVE this season,this is probably my FAVORITE season from the series so far. it keeps you on the edge and has some fun graphics
4,Bones,One of my favorite shows on television. I have loved the story lines and await the 6th season's price coming down so I may contribute to my series collection
1,Formatted incorrectly,"Somebody cropped this video incorrectly. You can only see the tops of people's heads. I checked the same Episode on iTunes and its fine. This one is not. Looks like the bottom half of the frame was dropped off and the video stretched to fit? Not sure. Anyway, seriously messed up. Don't buy until Amazon fixes it. As of 9/2/2010."
5,Bones: The Complete Fifth Season,received well with in the time given. Arrived in condition Promised (NEW) very happy with my purchase.Will be getting the sixth season soon.
5,"Love, love, LOVE Bones!!","I was excited to get season 5 of Bones!! We love watching it, and I finished off the season while my son was visiting his father for the weekend. Darn the luck, I had to watch it again when he got home. My only complaint would be the plastic casing was cracked at the bottom and has chipped off since. Otherwise, LOVE IT!!"
4,Bones,One of the few TV series that holds my interest and has a cast that melds well. Most of the newer shows may be OK but not worth my money to own.
5,B&B's comfort level,"Booth is so comfortable with Brennan as his partner he just hands her his gun now and says ""Cover me""...shows how far they've come...Love Daisy's reaction to Booth in his boxersDaisy: ""Oh, Agent Booth you look...wow""Another great ep"
4,"Even After 5 Seasons, Booth and Bones Still Have It!","I must admit, at first I didn't think this show had the capacity to last more than 1 or 2 seasons. It started off so cookie cutter-ish that I couldn't see myself continuing to watch it. But the relationship between Booth and Bones has been so well crafted that I'm now totally hooked! The show still manages to walk that fine line between dark comedy and intense (often graphic) subject matter. Wish they had brought back Zack, though...what a great character and so well acted.I've always wondered what Emily Deschanel was like in real life (does she actually posses real social skills?) so I picked upBones: Cast & Creators Live at Paley...Loved hearing her take on Dr. Temperance Brennan. It was also neat to hear from the creators of Bones and learn about their inspiration for the show. With all the crime series out there, it's interesting to learn about what makes this one so unique. I hope they can keep it up for all of Season 6."
5,BONES is great!,We just really like BONES! Just glad we could get a complete season reasonably priced! We couldn't find the 5th season in stores anywhere.
5,Bones TV Series,"My wife and I are hard pressed to find an episode of BONES we don't like and this one is no exception. We truly enjoyed it. Especially, we are pleased to be able come to Amazon and get the episodes we miss on regular broadcasting and download them to our DVR. That's amazing! Thanks, Amazon, for offering this service. The quality is perfect and very prompt."
5,An exploration of the musicsphere,"Am I really the first to review this CD? As a stumbling amateur guitarist, of course the techniques displayed are inspiring: complex picking with underlying bass lines, harmonics, slide guitar, hammering. You have to remind yourself that, throughtout the CD, it is one person playing one guitar at one point in time. Sometimes electric. Sometimes an acoustic. I find that Preston Reed seems to deliberately explore a technique and a mood in each piece. In Instrument Landing, it's a space age blues tune shaped by echoing harmonics. Franzl's Saw is a weaving of slide guitar that evokes both a journey ending and then its struggle. There are several of the jazzy themes of the type that he has been writing and playing over the years: Chord Melody, Woman in the Tower, and False Spring (which has appeared on an earlier CD). I find it a perfect CD for a road trip; you can concentrate on the music and let it paint the countryside."
1,Not Compatible With Vista,"The reviews of this product are of little value unless the reviewer shares info about his computer's operating system. I have Vista. Versions 10 and 11 of the Ulead product share something in common: neither is reliable when you have Vista installed as your operating system. Forget what their advertisements say...I'm good with computers, and trust me, this product, and everything I've tried (except for Adobe's product) crashes frequently (80% of the time in my case). To make matters worse, Ulead's web-site is awful -- and often, as this morning -- you cant even get into the site....Save your money."
1,"Great for making coasters, awful for making DVDs",This product is anything but intuitive. I still can't figure out how to make it work in its most basic form having created 3 vaguely decent DVDs and a dozen coasters.Its ability to scan your video camera and split the tape into clips is excellent. Its ability to let you drag those clips onto a story board is excellent. Clipping bits off the front and back of clips is a breeze. Adding titles to your clips is pretty easy.Creating chapters and menus is a nightmare. It either uses your entire movie as the title (complete with elevator music) or it misses out a great chunk of your soundtrack so that your visit to Disneyland contains your commentary for your sister's wedding. I haven't even dared to try the flashy features that this product boasts as even the basic ones won't work.Buy something - anything - else.
3,A surprise,"This edition of the band is much different than any or the previous editions. On this recording the horn textures are different, darker. The suite is very well developed with outstanding solos. The guitar work is the best this band has ever had. The Piltch brothers shine. There are a few rough spots and some people tend to fault this band for not staying with a set formula but that has been one of the best aspects of this band since it's inception. They have always had type flight musicians so they could always afford to take chances. This recording has the most different feel of all their albums. The whole structure and style of arrangment is different. Strong soloing throughout."
3,"Not B, S, & T","To me this album was a disappointment. Had I first listened to it without knowing who it was, B,S & T wouldn't have appeared on the radar screen. The musicianship is very good, but the songs aren't memorable. When you listen to B, S & T you expect it to sound like B, S & T. That's what attracts you to the group. The arrangements are heavily funkafide. Put this at the end of your B, S & T album buys and when you do, don't file it with the rest of their albums. It's a different animal."
1,My dog is REALLY sick from these,"I gave my dog her first jumbone two days ago. Since then she has been super sick, lethargic, and throwing up about 3x per day. If this does not get better tomorrow morning I will be taking her to the vet :("
5,At last! There is hope for hopeless food lovers.,"The book is really in two very distinct parts. Part one is the usual format for a diet book. Intro, explination, a doctors openion etc. The second part is where the excitement starts. The program is laid out in a very creative way! You are led, day by day, through the program. Judy Mazel is one of us. She really knows what it is like to be an EATER! Best of all she teaches you how to continue being an eater. Sound impossible? It did to me too. After reading though, it all makes since to me. The first part of the diet is pretty tough but not overly so. The maintanance part is a dream come true. It's worth the tough part many times over."
2,Could be a lot better,"First the good:Yes, food combining and using principles of enzymes and digestion does help. However the use of just fruit is limiting. FOLKS, it all really boils down to eating healthy carbohydrates, good fats and quality proteins on a low calorie diet while getting adequate nutrition. I pretty much as already eating most of the time as this book dictates so it wasnt really a major revelation or anything to me. I read it in the bookstore and thought that it was ok but severely lacking in facts and references to backup what the author was preaching. For a better book on diet, read the Okinawa Program Study and the Zone. More evidence and remember rapid weight loss of more than 2-3 pounds a week is bad news because then you are losing water and muscle and not fat."
2,"Concept good, but too regimented. Rather Somersize.","Two thirds of the way through grape day I broke down and had a tuna sandwich. The 3 pounds in water that I had lost came right back the next morning. I read an article in a health magazine about Susanne Sommer's books and the concept was very similar to this one, so I decided to buy her books and found her diet much more liveable. I know someone that has lost 15 lbs on the Beverly Hills diet after 3 weeks and likes that it's regimented. If you get bored easily of not having enough variety, then you should probably buy the Sommer's book instead."
3,The New Beverly Hills Diet worked for me but...,"The New Beverly Hills Diet worked for me but there were times such as all fruit days that I craved something more substantial and filling. During the 35 Day plan I lost 15 pounds (5 pounds a week during the first three weeks) but once the 35 days was up, I was not able to continue eating the way I did during the diet. I do believe that there is something to food combining, but Judy Mazel's program was too strict for me to follow. One book that is easy to follow is ""The Hay Diet Made Easy"" by Jackie Habgood, which gives straightforward information about food combining!"
1,Risky fad diet inducing short-term weight loss.,"Weight loss on this 35 day ""diet"" occurs almost exclusively by eating (carbohydrates) fruits of high fluid content which induce diuresis (water loss) via urination. It is true that pineapples, grapes and watermelon will activate digestive enzymes which will break down stored body fats when no other nutritive values are applied. However, starvation or lack of proper nutrition will have the same weight loss effect...Dieters, be aware!"
1,"Serious health hazard !!! Can cause diarrhea, gastritis etc.","Here's a sample day's menu: eight ounces of prunes for breakfast, all-you-can-eat strawberries for lunch, and all-you-can-eat baked potatoes for dinner. If you still have weight to lose after completing the initial 35-day plan, you continue the diet.Calorie counts can swing high or low, depending on just how much of the daily specified foods you eat. What's more, bingeing on huge quantities of fruit is also likely to cause stomach distress, acidity, heartburn,gastritis and diarrhea. This diet is dangerously low in protein, vitamins, and minerals.It's a health hazard."
1,This is a fad diet that people should beware of!,"I followed this diet very closely for 12 days and neither gained nor lost weight. I feel that people should be wary of this diet; apparently some people have lost weight on it, but some people will not. I have lost weight on restricted carbohydrate diets but thought I would give it a try. I think it can be dangerous for people who have blood sugar problems (as a lot of people apparently do) to consume the huge amounts of carbos found in fruit."
5,This is a really good book.,"I think that this book really helped me to make the right choies about what i eat. Thank You Judy M.In french it is, Je adores Judy!!!"
1,save your time and money,"I did this diet religously for two weeks. Yes, it works. But so does eating right. The difference is, you will lose weight very quickly doing the beverly hills diet. Eating right, you will keep it off. On the BH diet, expect the moment you go off of it to gain double what you lost."
2,weighted gloves,I bought these gloves hoping to add to my cardio workout. They don't fit very well and they constantly move when you are moving. They are very bulky and I am constantly readjusting them. I wouldn't recommend these gloves at all.
3,its ok,"the product is good. i bought it because it is two pounds each, instead of one pound each. the finger holes are nice and appreciated. the flap that protects your wrists from the velcro wrap strap (rubbing) is a little short...it works, but the flap has to be pulled and adjusted in order to lay under the velcro strap. the gloves and strap do the jobs i expected them to do...they could use some minor design improvements."
2,not for everyone,I bought these gloves about 3 weeks ago to combine with my cardio workout. They don't fit on your hands very well and they constantly move when you are moving. Your hands get sweaty really fast with them on and they are very bulky. If you are not use to wearing weighted gloves while working out I wouldn't recommed these at all.
3,"eh, ok","wasn't as big as I thought, +9a9nd it's gets a little uncomfortable after I use it for more than 15 minutes."
5,Written for all who have high achievment goals,Larry Pino does a super job describing a new and fascinating industry. Anyone who wants to start a business in the industry of the future should read this insightful book.
4,Great Introductory book,"This is a great book to introduce the reader to the different types of cash flow sources. The book doesn't go too much into the ""nuts and bolts"" of actually doing the business though. I guess it serves it purpose as an introductory text."
1,Author can't be trusted,Do a Google search on Laurence Pino before you buy his book(s).Put your money to better use.
1,Master Rip off artist,"Laurence Pino is a crook. Just google his name and read the past history on him. He just keeps inventing new ""companies."" Better yet just read some of the notes in Orlando Division of Federal Bankruptcy Court.He had at least 25-30 companies that ran into the ground. I guess that qualifies him to write as an authority!Why didnt he just use his brians for good instead of stealing from innocent people?"
3,Good book for those ignorant about Cash Flow!,"After reading, Building Wealth by Russ Whitney.I stumbled upon this book.Good book for people who want to learnabout factoring, note buying andbecoming a millionaire.I can't wait to buy a future home study course.Good book for non-financial people everywhere."
5,Ultimate primer on cash flow instruments.,"The ultimate primer on cash flow instruments, punctuated with examples, in layman's terms. No fluff! Succinct material defining the menu of fifty plus instruments, where to find them and mosts importantly - the ways to make money!Must reading for those wanting to make money on the side or to lay the foundation for a full time endeavor. Where was this book 25 years ago when I needed it? It's going on my reccommended reading list for my students. Prof. R. Richardson"
1,golf ball in glass,"Disappointed that the ball in glass was not a real ball cut in half like the one I was trying to replace. It looked like the 2 red lines were trying to cover a brand name but that was not the case. RSV, Pensacola"
5,Delightfully light entertainment! Think Broadway musical comedy.,"If your idea of opera is ""heavy"" and epic music developing heroic themes, then, this Rossini farce is not for you. But, if you want to lay aside your cares and just enjoy a good time, then by all means buy this DVD. I couldn't help thinking about modern musical comedy, which fulills the same purpose as this earliest effort by Rossini: just provide an escape for a reasonable length of time. This production makes a good case for type-casting singers who not only can sing and act but are believable because they are more or less the ages of the characters they portray on stage. The entire production is suited to the small Rokokotheater used in the Schwetzingen Festival, and what's more important in this case, to the small home theater. Delightful entertainment!"
2,Not for the experienced nurse,"This is a very good book for an academic setting or for a new RN. It was not however helpful to me, a nurse with more than two decades of experience. This book contains rudimentary information, with examples of excellent charting but as a quick reference for unusual circumstances I felt in was cumbersome at best."
5,Excellent Toy,I can't complain on the price simply because we got a wonderful deal here on Amazon. The item arrived as described with no shipping damages what so ever. I puchased for my 2 7 year old girls and they absolutely love it. Some of the games are a little advanced which is better for us because it will take much longer for her to out grow it. Both of the girls absolutely love the globe.
3,OK for what I paid,"As someone wrote before, you have to be careful with those stickers, if not, you will rip the globe.My problem is with he hear sliding sswitch. iy is supposed to say facts about oceans and stuff. but it recognises states and conitnents. when I slide it to 'countries' it does not recognise. when i slide it to' oceans' , it does not recognise, nor says any factsa bout any ocean.[...]overall, globe is OK, voice is not very clear. nothing great, and definitely has the fel of being cheaply made."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The sound quality of this product is extremely POOR! My daugther had to put her ear against the globe just to hear anything even when the volume was turned all the way up. When I tried to return the product to the seller, ToysUSA, refused to accept the return and did not acknowledge that the product was defective. I wasted or shall I say that ToysUSA stole my $50 plus the additional $14 for shipping cost. Overall, the product and the seller should receive a fat ZERO on product and customer service!!!!"
2,Wish I would have gotten something better,Not at all what I expected. It is very difficult to understand what the Globe is saying and therefore not really helpful in using as an educational tool. The globe seems cheaply made and is not worth the price at all.I wish I would have gotten something better.
2,Do Not Waste Your Money!,"We purchased this globe for our eight-year-old daughter. The globe came with postage size ""advertisements"" stuck around the globe. When my daughter tried to take off the ""advertisements"" the paper on the globe came with them. I have tried since the end of December to resolve this issue with MGA Entertainment, and they have for a lack of a better word, called me a liar and said my daughter has stuck ""stickers"" on the globe and that is why there is no Mexico, Israel, Japan, and part of the Atlantic Ocean. The sad part is that my daughter likes the globe and is learning about different languages, music, and currency. She does not want to give up the globe, but for what you pay, I would really like a replacement from the manufacturer."
3,the voice is not too clear,I bought this product for my daughters. It is hard to point to smaller states with the pen as the tip is a little broad and the voice is not that clear. The room should be very quite to understand clearly what the globe says. Otherwise it is a good educational toy. My girls love bratz and that is the reason I bought this toy.
4,Pleased Mom,"This is a great learning tool for little bratz lovers, the pointer is not the best for accuracy when pointing to a location on the globe but for the most part it's a good and fun learning tool great CHRISTmas gift."
1,Rust_Oleum Paint,"The Rust-Oleum Mrine Topside PaintThe paint had all spilled by the time it arrived, so there is no way to positively rate it. I should have recieved a new can but did not."
5,Great coverage,"I used this product over the primer from the same company. The wood trim on my screened porch was looking horrible, but the combination of the two products worked wonders. I love it."
1,The product deserves 5 stars,"The number of tablets is not listed anywhere under the description until you scroll down. All of the other sellers of the product list the # of tablets under the main heading felt this was VERY misleading considering the cost is similar to the 90 count by the other sellers. This product is uncomparable in the results my small terrier has had in her arthritis. All of the other products left her limping and favoring her paw. This one allows her to be the ""terror"" she is and run and play and not think of the pain she is. Prouct is a 5 star -- the seller is a 1 star."
2,Wish it had worked.....,"I have a 10 year old medium sized dog of misc. breed that has trouble getting up with what seems to be stiffness in her hip(s) and also has swelling in her back leg joint from an old injury. I've used almost the complete bottle and besides 2 days where she seemed to get around much better, the rest of the time has been what I would say is the same to worse than before I started her on it. I will continue the bottle until it runs out in a few days, but won't be buying it again. For the most part, she eats them fine, occasionally refusing, but if I make it a ""treat fest"" with the other dogs, she will get caught up in the excitement and eat them without problem."
4,Great Fast Workout,This workout was just what I was looking for on the days that I don't have an hour to exercise. It's fast and demanding all in 30 minutes. Did not use the Fanny Lifter per say just my old trusty box. Seem to work just as well.
2,the firm cardio sculpt blaster,i found this tape to be very easy. It did not raise my heartto my target heart rate at all i didn;t even break a sweat i tried it again raising the fanny lifter to 8 inches still not a over all challanging workout. I still pefer the older firm tapes to the newer ones. They are more effective i find.Sinceanna benson has started her own tapes fitprime i find the firm has lost there edge. Anna Benson is the creator of the firm workouts pre 2001.
4,Great for a quick cardio workout...pair it with an ab tape,I love this tape. I found the choreography easy to follow after the second time. The music isn't bad and I find the instructor motivating. I like to pair it with an ab tape or an upper body workout.
2,Wasted my money,"I purchased this dvd in the store and am sadly disappointed. I had read so many good things about Firm workouts. I guess if you're familiar with their moves, etc, you'll like this workout. I'm not--and the instructor went so fast that it was impossible for me to catch on and keep up. I've done many workouts over the years and have rarely had a problem getting into the routine. This was an exception. Wish I could return this product."
2,confused,"I bought this tape thinking it was a regular cardio tape. I had no idea that all of the firm's tapes require the use of this fanny lifter thing. Isn't it enough I wasted money on the tape, now they want me to go spend money on equipment? Ok, well I guess some people don't mind. But they should at least make that clear in the video description so that people don't waste money on something they don't want. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because if I actually wanted to waste money on the fanny lifter it would have been a decent tape."
1,Waste of money,I consider myself to be a veteran of home workout videos. This is the WORST of all time. The lead instructor flies through the movements without doing counts or adequate reps or instruction in a horrid twang that rings of an overly peppy cheerleader who is nothing but pure fluff. I am VERY disappointed with this purchase. The other FIRM videos with other instructors are much better---stay away from this airhead who blitzes through the workout without sufficient instruction.
2,Major disappointment!,"I bougth this tape because I love the Firm tapes I own, the older ones.This tape was a major disappointment for me. I did not get a sweat out of this tape but, at the same time I could not follow through with them. They go from one step to another, as if you rehearsed each step with them for six weeks before the shot the tape.I was totally uncoordinated. They were doing one step, then another, and another, and I was still trying to figure out the first step. Doing this workout I felt like a chicken with my head cut off.I will just stick with their streingth training tapes. Those are awesome, and they really do tone you!For cardio, I would recommend the one hour Tae-Bo's. They are easier to follow. You work out a heavy sweat and he actually explaines each step before going to another."
1,This Looks Like A New Workout,"I am glad that Amazon lists this as a 2003 release, but if you see it in the stores the back cover shows a 2006 release date. It has a new cover and Lisa Kay's hair is longer, but it is the same 2003 video. I think it is a little deceptive to display it with other Firm new releases. I contacted customer service at the FIRM and was told that this was the first they have heard of it."
4,Great moves but need a bigger step,"I have quite a few FIRM VHS and DVD workouts. I like this one because it makes your mind work too, BUT if you are use to doing regular step workouts with a large step - be careful with this one. I fell off or tripped over the purple part of the Fanny Lifter twice the first time I did this workout and then I was too nervous about falling to really get a good workout. But when I tried it with one of my regular steps though it was just fine. Just passing this along with the hopes that it might help someone else enjoy this workout."
4,Decent for enjoying the benefits of video workout,"I was kind of curious what The Firm Cardio videos had to offer. I bought this one as an afterthought, to go with the Cardio Inferno. This one has a lot of mild techniques, but gets the muscles warmed up pretty good. I don't sweat as much with this one as the Infirno.I'm quick to pick up on the techniques, but also have to slow down at times to get the right form down. These videos are more my pace than anything I've seen in a long time. I've been stuck on one Pilate's video for many years. This is just the switch up I needed for the season."
4,"Overall, pleased with my purchase","Purchased this for watching TV on my computer. Was not interested in the recording features, and have not yet tried. Selected Hauppauge because of the more favorable reviews than other brands. Also decided on the PCI card instead of a USB device because of reviews indicating lesser picture quality with the USB devices. Have a Windows Vista machine and it runs great on Media Center. Also works with WinTV software provided. Installation and setup was easy. Was watching TV within about 20 mins of opening the box. Picture quality is very good. On the negative side, the tuner card failed after several weeks of use. However, Amazon was great about sending out a new unit. Was up and running again within 5 days. Overall, pleased with the product and the support from Amazon.Note there are many variants of this product. I got this one because it ran on Media Center and had a remote. Would not buy without the remote."
1,Item arrived DOA,"This item lives on the floor of my closet because the device never worked. I am a skilled computer operator and technician, I was unable to get this device to work. The drivers would not install correctly. I bought the ATI TV Wonder 650 outboard device and it worked perfectly."
2,Remote Stinks,I received the product the tuner was easy to install and worked fine. Could not get the remote control to work. Tried everthing listed on the manufactures site.
5,Fun to read,"Auntie was Stephany Indie's signature story as a story teller in Hawaii and on the mainland. As her sister, I heard it told many times and each time it was a delight! Auntie captures a story size bite of Hawaii,and the illustrations are like a quick tour. Auntie is so full of life, it will be enjoyed by children and adults, and by anyone who can be touched by Aloha!"
5,Best film on his life,"The whole movie was excellent. Not enough people know what Adam Clayton Powell did that effects everyone's life, especially in the South. I brought this copy for my school library."
3,A conventional murder-mystery in a unique setting,"This was a pretty entertaining ""who dunnit."" The ancient Egypt setting definitely helped set this apart from other mysteries I've read. I can't shake this feeling that the concept of ""police"" is anachronistic (which is might not be...I don't know much about the period), and this book reads like it is in the middle of a series (i.e., there are references to earlier events/activities that appear to assume that the reader is already acquainted with them). Overall, this was fun and light, with just enough twists to keep me interested to the end."
2,Tedious,I could barely get through this book. Everything was padded to novel length when the content deserved little more than short story treatment. Even with the provided character glossary the political hierarchy and relationship was still confusing. There was little tension and drive. Steven Saylor and Lindsey Davis have no competition here.
4,Good Series,"I have now read all of Lauren Haney's Lieutenant Bak series. I found each of the stories to be entertaining. If Ms. Haney were to write more books in the series I would read them. I wish she had written a prequel to her first book explaining what Lieutenant Bak had done to offend the pharaoh and lose his position as a charioteers.The Lord Meren books by Lynda Robinson is another series set in ancient Egypt which I have enjoyed. I do find that Lynda Robinson's main characters are better developed than Lauren Haney's. That said, I do recommend both series of books.They were both entertaining and left me wishing the writer would come out with another book in the series."
2,"Slow Start, Good Middle Act, Unsatisfying End","I had hoped I had found another great series of Egyptian myseries like those of Lynda S Robinson (my favorite) or Brad Geagley. Unfortunately, the book just didn't deliver in the mystery department. It is very descriptive of Egyptian life and I'll give the author credit for setting it in an uncommon part of Egypt. But the fundamentals of the mystery were off. It started too slow, it did build some intrique halfway through by creating a solid list of potential ""suspects"" but the resolution to the main mystery and a secondary mystery just left me unsatisfied. It's difficult for me to elaborate without revealing too many details of the book so let me just concolude that there are much better Egyptian mysteries available."
2,Dullsville,"Although I read the book to the end, it was a struggle. The characters were superficial, the background descriptions unsatisfying and the denouement not particularly gripping. Having been spoilt by Lindsay Davis's wonderful Falco series, I was hoping for something more evocative of daily life in Ancient Egypt but I never got a real sense of anything in this story. I won't be reading any more adventures of Lt Bak."
5,Gone Fishing,"I ordered this book for my husband and he seemed to enjoy it and passed it onto my brother-in-law who lives in the middle of Central California (we live on the boundry, I guess, of Central and Northern California)."
5,Most Amazing Guide Ever for Fishing in California!!!,"Everyone I know that is an avid fisherman and outdoorsman loves this book as well as all the others written by Mr. Shaffer. Not only are the descriptions excellent, but the pictures give a clear indication of what you are going to see and experience at each locale. Without question, I would recommend this book to anyone I know and already have done so."
2,May be considered by the author when he writes his next book,"I think this book marginalized and almost ignored the most important case in human rights and human rights violations. Where is the Israeli-Palestinians case and why it's missing from Mr. Schulz book, is it because it will show the obvious contradiction between what USA says and what it actually do. What happens when the interests of the United States collides with the human rights. These question and many others needs answers in order to support the arguments made by the author."
3,5 Stars for the Set but only ONE for the price!,"I currently see prices on Amazon of $31.99 for Seasons one through 3 of Taxi.....this adds up to $95.97. Why this package is currently selling for $107.99 is beyond me. I am cognizant that Amazon changes prices from individual to individual (a little known secret), but the abyss between this package and the individual titles, with no apparent additions in DVD extras, is astounding. With the Seinfeld you get a puffy shirt or napkin holders from Monks coffee house; this package does not appear to offer anything extra.The show gets 5 stars, but adding up the show with the value per dollar, I am forced to give this package 3 stars. Sad, because it is one of the greatest shows to ever grace television in my opinion."
4,Funny Show,"One of the funniest comedies ever, once it hit it's rythm in the second season. Christopher Lloyd was hilarious as Jim Ignatowski. Whaaaaaa doesssss aaaaaa yellowwwwww lighttttt meannnnnnn. Crazy stuff. Love that stuff."
1,LADY JANE GREY,"What happened here ? just went to view this DVD to find it is only a 15 min trailer. I was interested in this story,so feel let down,and robbed of my costs. feel sad as I have always had such good service prior..It will be good to hear from you with a big why.. claudia seiboth.."
4,Very Hefty Chain Lock,"Kryptonite New York 5'6"" Chain and disc lockI purchased this lock to protect a hybrid electric bicycle. Even though I live in suburbia, I sometimes ride to places where bicycle theft is common. I wanted to replace a cable lock that was hard to stretch out and always tried to spring back to the coiled position. This chain lock is very flexible and easy to stretch out so that the bicycle isn't pulled over while trying to lock it to a post. I got the 5'6"" version rather than the heavier 5' version because I thought the extra length would come in handy when locking to telephone poles. I thought the 10 mm chain size referred to to the link width. It actually refers to the link thickness. It is a massive chain. Any potential thief would be intimidated just by its appearance. Plus: very strong and flexible. Minus: heavy and bulky."
1,The key is the weakest link,"Although the chain and lock are sturdy the keys seem to be made of extremely soft metal. Right out of the shipping container, I tried the lock with one of the keys and the key part broke off from the plastic stem that you put on a key chain. I did not force it. It broke off like butter. Thank goodness I was not on the trail. Kryptonite, are you listening? Quality control should not only apply to locks and chains! What Garbage in my own expensive lesson/opinion. . Hope it makes a good door stop."
1,Repetitive and redundant,John Patrick has written an article and stretched it into a book. He keeps saying the same things over and over...we get the point! There are much better roulette books on the market.
1,Written by an ex roulette player,"John Patrick no longer plays roulette professionally .He lives in Florida where there are no casinos and his only professional gamblinginterest is sports betting.John Patrick's strategy is short term wins. However what he does not tell you is thatto make small wins you have to often dig deep with your bank roll.This inevitably means that the game will come where you cannot get back and youlose your total bank roll.Patrick's strategy is 20% win goal. However he does not tell you that youwill have to bet down to 100% of your bank roll to make this 20%.This means that if you win 5 games in a row and lose just one game then you havemade no money at all.Patrick does not understand math ,which is a big disadvantage for a so called pro.There is nothing in this book that will give you a strategy to beat the odds in Roulette."
1,don't pretend to win in the long run with this book,"This books explains a lot progressions and money management in roulette, but none of the strategies in this book will give you and edge over the house. It's for recreational players only, who want to have fun only."
4,To all the fans in Europe:,"Fact: I live in Norway and bought this from Amazon.com in the US. The great news is that this plays on my BD as well, and its not region free. So we can all enjoy it even though it says to be region A.I have only seen the first concert and love it."
1,Michael MCDonald Live/A Tribute to Motown Live,"Tried to purchase this video twice and had the same problem NO AUDIO SOUND, so I was not able to rate. I would very much like to view and purchase if I could get a good copy I love Michael Mc Donald awesome singer. Contact me if Amazon finds one in good working order."
1,Lasted only 3 months,Brand name batteries have been lasting me at least 5 years. After 3 months this battery would no longer charge. Need I say more?
3,NOT an Original Welch Allyn battery,"Just FYI, although the battery does seem to work, it is not a Welch Allyn. It is some Korean rip-off brand. Shady that seller does not mention that in the listing, however the battery does work."
2,more like a survey of results then an introduction,"Although this claims to be an introductory text, it is more like a collection of results in stochastic processes. The notation is often impenetrable and there is not a uniform level of rigor in the text. Some results are presented in detail, and others sort of assume you've seen them before. There is no unifying theme here. It's hard to know where the author is going. A better rigorous book is ""Stochastic Processes"" by Doob."
5,Great humor from the past,"I loved this show when it was airing in the late 70s and early 80s, and I love it now. It is great to see some of the episodes that I had forgotten about -- why can't today's shows have actors like these?"
5,Taxi the complete third season : A great classic sitcom,"Taxi is my favorite sitcom along with Cheers and Seinfeld.The third season offers a lot of laughs and funny moments.My favoriteepisodes in this set are [Zen and art of cabdriving],[Loui'sRival] and [Latka the playboy] and my favorite scene is whenLatka transforms into Vic Ferrari after reading a playboy magazine.Taxi the complete third season is a must have collectionand I can't wait for the complete fourth season."
2,With eggs?,"I don't know how to use this album...I tried many times...but I can't understand...""Anytime At All"" is great...""Live At perkins Palace"" is good...This,I don't know...maybe I have to use it in another way...maybe I have to cook it with my eggs & bacon at morning,then maybe it could be ready to digest."
4,finally got it,Well after over a week after release amazon had still not shipped so I cancelled my order and got it cheaper at the store.Now i see they dropped there price.First off the box is over sized for what is in it.Big piece of 2 inch foam inside.The cloth maps are ok I guess but could be a little bigger so you can read the names that are printed on the contenents.The comic book is about 4 inches by 6 inches and maybe a dozen pages. I have not read it yet but not very impresive.The manuel seemed ok and the cover was made out of pleather.5 discs in a cardboard container that folds out.The pewter figurene is really cool and heavy but unfortunatley even though it comes in a bubble pack mine had a bent sword which really bummed me out.I will have to contact them about a replacment since it is obvious that it was done at the factory.The best part is if you don't already have the discs you save money.If you are not a die hard EQ fan and have the discs don't waste the money.I hope this helps.
5,Game of the Millenium,"I have played this game since its introduction. I have purchased the expansions individually as they have been released. This item is a nice addition to any everquest collectors collection. I plan on keeping this in its original packaging, and continue to use my old CD's until they look like my grandmothers old scratched up kitchen table. SKATERRRRR GNOME rules, see you all in the game."
5,I wish I never bought previous versions,"Even cool cats like me play EQ. I wish I had never bought any other versions of EQ and just got this one. It has everything you need, all the expansions, and a tight tin container. If you're thinking about starting...get this one."
1,Find a better game company,"Although the game in of itself is ok, players depend on the company to run it well to enjoy the time spent playing it. Sony has perhaps made every mistake in the book and a few new ones managing this product. Customer support is almost non-existant, quality testing of game changes is a joke, and the rule set of the game appears to be written in disapearing ink. Pick the wrong class and you could find your character's abilities or equipment completely changed for the worse even after years of play. The latest high impact insult to loyal customers were of the Monk class, an excellent and fun class to play before recent changes. Monks are not the first nor will they be last to suffer from the horrid mismanagement of Everquest. I highly suggest you view the recent EQ player message boards before investing money or time into this product."
4,Good weight video,"This won't get your heart rate going, at least until you get to the leg portion, but it is a good video if you want to work on weight lifting. Most of their videos pair weight training with aerobics. However some, like this one, is just weights. I like it. It is broken into segments....amrs, legs, arms and legs. I like to mix up aerobics with the weight lifting videos for better results. I love the Firm videos and the results I am getting."
2,Not inspiring,"The new Firm tapes do not even approach the intensity and fun of the original Firm workouts. Did the company sell the brand name or something? I'm just starting to get back into shape after three years off with pregnancy/baby, during which time I didn't exercise at all. So I'm quite out of shape. Even so, this tape was not tough. Worse, it was boring. I ended up getting the old vintage Firm tapes, the ones with Janet Jones and Susan Harris -- finally available on DVD. Those are intense, full-body workouts that wear you out yet energize you at the same time."
2,Too eay and too much stretching in between sets,"The arm workout was entirely too easy and there is entirely too much stretching between sets. All the stretching is annoying. I definitely would NOT recommend this video to people seeking an intermediate or advanced workout, although it would probably be good for beginner."
4,Strong workout for begginners,"The video met my expectatives, because it was hard enough to feel the workout and it used the fannylifter. It has three different sessions that can be done separately or alltogether. The upper body is really good and you can feel it, specially with the dumbells. The warming session of the lower body part is a little difficult to follow up for a begginner, because it includes different movements with little reps. But the exercises for the lower body are really strong and do shape the legs. The abs part is short, but is intense. I recommend it definitively for begginners."
3,Extra Equipment Needed,"If you are purchasing this item, you will either need to buy a ""Fanny Lifter"" or use your own step in the best way you can. I think you really should have the equipment they recommend as I could not do part of the video without it.If you have any knee problems, skip this completely. We are talking about a knee intensive workout. Squats, lunges and lots of aerobic moves. This is definitely an intermediate workout with the weights. Beginners can do the exercises without the weights.You will break a sweat while doing this workout. That is for sure. It is fast paced and the three segments seem to go by in no time at all.You need three sets of weights - 3, 5 and 8lb dumbbells.There are three workouts which do have enough of a warm-up and cool-down segment so you can do them individually when you don't have 40 minutes.Workouts:Upper BodyLower BodyAb WorkoutStephanie Corley leads this workout that has yes, not one, but five instructors.Calorie Burning Workout!~The Rebecca Review"

2,Get Fit for 2008,"The steps/instructors are too difficult to follow. I'll bet that I will burn calories trying to learn them though. LOL. I ordered four different DVD's from the Firm. Will try and try again, as I do believe in the philosophy of buildng muscles to burn more calories."
1,Bought this as a joke,For my brotherwe watched this movie in the theaters so many years ago when we were very young (maybe 8 and 11) and even at those tender ages we realized that we just were subjected to one of the worst movies of all times. To this day when I am asked which are the worst movies I ever saw....this movie is on the top or right near the top of the list.
2,Not necessary I spent my money for nothing.,"The Cable companies don't tell you that you need a different box in order to capture the HD signal, so spending money for a HDMI cable is useless."
4,Decent Assortment of Big Pop Hits,"Even though some of these songs are available on better collections (Monkees, Association, Mamas & Papas), the rarer tracks make the CD worth investigating. All original versions."
5,Fascinating!!!,This is an outstanding book that highlights many fascinating discoveries that anyone with cancer (or a loved one with cancer) should know. It's hard to believe that this information is not more publicly known.
1,Lance Lee responds,"Anyone interested in background on myself should avoid this publication: it is hopelessly full of inaccuracies, and an attempt to contact the publisher to correct them got no response. It's irresponsible even to post it. - Lance Lee"
3,Cheap... but... cheap.,"This webcam is pretty inexpensive, but the quality is very bad. The image is extremely noisy, and that affects very badly the ability of the codecs to encode the video efficiently. In other words, If you can't afford to get a slightly better camera, I guess it's ok. If you can, buy something a more expensive."
1,No linux support,I would have liked to try this product although I had to take it back and get a Phillips webcam because there was no support for running this product on Linux and I refuse to run Micro$oft products on my computers.Creative support through their website was also of no use in trying to get this running in linux. They simply do not care about non Windows users.
2,Not a good book for the visual learner,"Spear offers many helpful tips, among them: 1) wetting the hair for 90 seconds before shampooing and 2) before cutting your bangs, in order to avoid cutting them too short, first wet them and allow the hair to dry for 3 minutes to determine shrinkage.That said, the main purpose of this book is to teach ordinary people to cut hair, and I'm not sure it does this very well. I've been cutting my 3 boys' hair for many years, having learned by using common sense and by watching my stylist's technique as she cut my hair. I was hoping this book would help me finally understand how to give a good haircut. Not so.If you are a visual learner, you will find it difficult to follow the step-by-step instructions, since there are few accompanying photos. At a minimum, the instructions for each type of haircut should be accompanied by a photo of that style, as well as head sketches or photos showing the progression of the haircut."
1,Not an easy book to follow,"I feel bad giving this author 1 star because I can only imagine how difficult it is to write a book. And I'm sure she's a good stylist. But I'm a guy who wants to cut his own hair and I couldn't find any easy-to-follow instructions in this book. I truly am a haircutting 'dummy' so I need a book that will treat me like a dummy- and this isn't it. There were terms I didn't understand 100% but no glossary to explain them and the index was little help. Since the book is over 300 pages, I wasn't about to flip through the pages to find answers.I would suggest that the next edition have far less talk and have far more photos with step-by-step instructions. As the old saying goes, a photo is worth a thousand words, but a drawing of hair is only worth about ten or twenty. Something like that..."
3,it's ok but don't spend the money,"I took out a copy from the library, it's worth it as a library book, has some helpful tips, but no reason to spend $15 on it."
1,Disappointed,"I cut my husband's hair, and was looking for some good direction for cutting and blending the back of mens hair, especially neckline and around the ears. This book could have been ever so much better if there were photos of actual hair cutting...how the hands are positioned, how the scissors are positioned, how the hair is actually held, what direction to cut in, etc.The book contains mostly drawings of cutting guides and how you should part the hair to do the cutting. I think these drawings are more beneficial for professionals. And although there are one or two drawings of the things I think would be most helpful (described above), they do not take place of photos (or series of photos) actually showing how it is done. The few photos that are included are of finished styles.While I did get one great tip from it, this book is not that helpful for people at home cutting their family's hair. I have liked other ""Dummies"" books, but I feel like I wasted my money on this one."
5,Very helpful,"Between watching my son's barber and using this book, I am getting pretty good at cutting his hair. The book's instructions are very clear. In general, it is hard to learn how to cut hair from just reading a book by itself. But, I think this is as good as any haircutting book can be. With some patience and practice you can save alot of money."
1,Where's the book for really stupid people??,There aren't enough pictures and the author writes in hard to understand language. I need a book that's written in easier language with tons more pictures. I would not order this book again.
2,Book is ok,"I've read this book, but there is lot missing. I,ve come across this site [...] for ebook on cutting hair, it taught me a lot more."
3,A Good Intro Book.,"If you need a repair manual that explain simple repairs and doesn't go to far into complex repairs this is a good book, It has some good diagrams and instructions but it also has alot of useless information. There are definately better bike manuals out there but for the average person this book is sufficient."
2,Not enough substance or details,"This book is a general introduction to bikes and bike maintenace, not a book that will guide you through difficult repairs or even many routine adjustments. The book's breezy, informal tone is friendly at first but becomes annoying when using the book as a repair guide."
1,"Great Lamp, Bad Warranty","I happened to love this lamp. It was perfect for studying and use around the computer. It did get a little hot but not so much that it would have to be moved away from the LCD. The problem with the lamp was the warranty. One week after the warranty (90 days) expired the ""touch"" sensor went bad and the manufacturer would not/could not fix it. So, take your chances. Maybe I just got a defective lamp from the beginning."
2,Dated is right!,"I haven't finished this book yet but its one-parent perspective is obsolete, at best. Phrases like ""when Daddy helps out"" just make my skin crawl. And who should the mother turn to when she needs a break? A sister, grandmother, or aunt. Hello? I don't personally know any families, even with one parent at home, who don't share childcare responsibilities. It's hard to take any of her insights without a grain of salt. Desperately in need of an update/revision."
1,Too dull,"This book talks about a 2 year old as if ALL THE 2 YEAR OLDS IN THE WORLD were alike. It stereotypes children. While it's true that children have some similar traits, it's totally false that they're all alike, and you shouldn't treat them the same either. No two human beings, and less no two 2 years olds, are alike. Everyone is unique. Every situation with every 2 year old should be approached and treated differently. Every tantrum is unique. Every child has different feelings.Want to read a great book for your child? A book written from the heart? Try Baby Book by Dr. Sears. Another great book is Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child by Gottman."
2,Good basic information but more detailed stuff is out-of-dat,"A nice, reassuring read for parents in the throes of the ""No!""s. It's heartening to learn that your kid isn't the only one who's suddenly become stubborn and negative. But some of the advice seems to be based on conjecture rather than solid, large-scale studies of kids. The authors, for instance, never make a cogent case for limiting toddlers' choices. And their contention that bright toddlers often dim as they get older is dated at best; more recent research supports continuity in cognitive development. A MUCH better book: Becoming the Parent You Want to Be."
4,slim and useful,"more helpful in its hundred-odd pages than the whole massive ""What to Expect, the Toddler Years"" is in about 700. Read this one first, use the latter as a reference."
3,YOUR TWO-YEAR OLD,IT WAS JUST LIKE OTHER BOOKS I HAD READ ON THIS SUBJECT. I HAD A LOT OF PROMISE BUT NO REAL INFORMATION. IT ASKED SOME OF THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT I HAD BUT THEN DIDN'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS EITHER.
3,Good Basic Info - written a LONG time ago,"This book provided some good basic information... made me feel better about what I was experiencing with my 2 1/2 year old. However, I'm not sure how much suggestion there was for change. Also the further into the book i got, the more the fact that it was written about 30+ years ago started to bother me...I found this to be a good informational book - if you're looking for answers as to why your 2 year old is acting the way he/she is... this is a great option. If, however, you are looking for some concrete ways to FIX IT - you may want to keep looking."
5,Old School Ways Super!,I loved this book. I really am into those old school ways for children and this is the book. I think we need to discipline this generation the way our parents did us. If your are a fan of Dr. Dobson you will like Bates too. I feel everyone could benefit from this book especially our children.
4,I enjoyed this story of a nun detective.,"I have just encountered another woman detective, in Death's a Beach. Author Winona Sullivan follows her P.I. nun into her second [and not last, I hope] case, where she is operating from a home for senior nuns and other seniors. The scenes and action come alive, showing the Everglades, Miami Beach, the gangsters, a sympathetic Miccosukee policeman, and another not-so-honest policeman. I was particularly drawn to the teenage ward of Sister Cecile and Jim Cypress, the Miccosukee 'good-cop.' The relationships and mutual understanding among the likeable and not-likeable characters were skillfully developed."
1,Too fragile for more than light jobs,"A contractor used these to hold a board being used as a vanity in place in my office bathroom. The first time I needed to remove the board, two of these snapped, which is why I looked these up to order a few more, including a couple backups, for the next time I need to remove the vanity. Not too incredibly sturdy."
4,good movie,"story of maria alvarez(catalina moreno)who lives in columbia,quits her job as a rose stripper and is desperate to find work to help support her family and baby-to-be.along the way she runs into a man who helps her with a job...as a drug mule.good spanish language film is good even if it is a bit slow moving.but the film clocks in at a respectable hour and 34 min. if it were longer i might not have liked it as much. the subtitles are easy to follow making it that much more enjoyable. the acting is great and deserves to be seen."
5,"A ""job"" that can kill","The desperately poor women who become carriers of drugs--inside their stomachs, no less--risk a terrible death but are willing to do so for the chance to live in the U.S. Not a propaganda piece, but a hard, cold look at the truth."
5,Welcome to the white room!,"In the middle of the most horrid of the miseries, a little spark of apparent bright seems to be a stairway to heaven. A miscarried woman recently pregnant for a pimp seeks desperately a winner solution becoming a mule. Once you get inside, forget it; there' s no way out.She decides to assume to risk, make some money and try to resolve her puzzled life. But you know how the life is, the things you plan, generally experience crucial and decisive twist s of fate, leaving you as cast away in the middle of the paradise.Tense and febrile drama that was availed for the surprising and excellent performance of this young actress of promissory future, Catalina Sandino.The reality, once ore surmounts all possible fiction. And you will be the silent witness of this fatal decision.Striking and bold script."
3,"Predictable, but good.","While the film was competent enough, it never surprised me. The story itself had more the feel of a documentary than a drama. I didn't feel like I got a whole lot more from the film than I did from just watching the trailer. Definitely worth watching if you want a look into what this kind of world is like, but it could have easily been much more compelling."
4,True to life,"Though I found the movie a little less than ""24"" like, it was really felt.It showed how ladies in this day and age do not think about whom they lay with and protection. It showed that individuals do not think about the consequences of smuggling drugs and they do not see the big picture, who will be (ab)using those drugs.It demonstrated that drug dealers consider their ""mules"" as animals and not as real humans and have little or no consideration for their mules only for the product.It touches if you have a heart."
2,Cheap reap off,"I wasn't impressed when i received this book, it was just a couple of pages of tribal tattoos that looked liked it was printed from the web, arranged and then folded and turned into a book. I ended up just walking into a tattoo shop for more options and designs for what i wanted."
5,Great product,"I love these gloves. I practice martial arts and use the gloves to do so. I can simulate grabbing, throwing, punching, using open hand techniques etc.etc...The gloves are very flexible and feel good on my hands. Highly recommended."
5,Exceptional electronic sound,"Lots of percussion and flowing rhythms make this one of my favorite cds. ""In The Mix"" uses such contemporary artists as 3rd Force and Craig Chaquico to generate an electronic remix with a quality dance beat."
5,Old English village psycho porn,"For many years there were villages in England where they got away with 'blue murder'. Never mind the mucky stuff to do with dog gets fox, or vice versa, which is of course the main plot of this book.There was other behaviour going on that some might be ashamed of although to some of us it's very funny.... in a twisted sort of way.What perplexes me is that the author is suppose to be based in Asia, yet has this finite knowledge of the foibles of English village life and the sort of pervs that thrive there.I wonder if the true identity of the author is that of a retired or disgraced Tory MP, who would now be better suited to running a whore house in Bankgok. I wonder. It's a breezy fun read and makes a change from the usual boring stuff that gets onto the bookshelves of WH Smiths."
2,Too hot to handle,There are two thing that I don't like about this set. The curlers get too hot to handle and the lid isn't attached to the base which is very inconvenient. I wouldn't recommend them.
1,Defective Electric Curlers,"I had the curlers less than 2 months, when I first received them they worked fine, within 2 weeks ago, the ""ON"" switch would light up, but the curlers would not heat up. Because it is beyound the 30-day return period, I called Vidal Sasson and was told to return the curlers to them, which I did yesterday. Hopefully, I will be replaced with a new curler set that works properly. In the meantime, I had to pay $14.85 in postage to return the curlers and an additional $6.00 to Vidal Sasson for shipping and handling fees."
2,These rollers Suck,I bought these rollers to replace my very old clariol rollers. I absoltely hate them. As soon as I put one in my hair another falls out. The teeth on these rollers don't hold. I am very unhappy with them. If I were Vidal Sasson I would be ashamed to put my name on them.
3,Good history plays,"This book is a nice collection of plays from American history, starting with the explorers going through to 1900s. It is best suited for grades 4-6, but I have successfully used these plays with 7th grade."
4,Amazing low price; outrageous S&H,"A friend needed microwavable bone china cups with roomy handles. She asked me to keep an eye out for English bone china. Why? It microwaves without being too hot to handle, and the microwave heats the liquids inside the cup. Other china and stoneware tends to heat the vessel, leaving the less heated liquids to cool quickly. I googled English bone china and was about to order some ([...] for one, not including shipping and handling) but found these instead (less than $1 apiece, plus shipping and handling fees that quintuple the cost). I ordered them, tried them and delivered them. They're not bone china, but they seem to meet with satisfaction. She liked them: challenge met. Amazon wins again."
5,Fun and fast to read!,"Keavy writing puts you on the edge from the moment you read the first sentence! You will not put the book down! Well worth the time, you'll escape from your world into someone else drama! Lots of fun to read!"
1,Why you shouldn't buy this item: WATCH THIS VIDEO FOR TRUTH ABOUT KV KITTY PAD,Length:: 0:53 MinsOutdoor Heated Kitty PadThermo Kitty MatK&H; Thermo-Kitty HutTM Color:SageK&H; Thermo-Kitty HutTM Color:Mocha
2,unsatisfactory model,"I have previously purchased (several years ago) a Thermo Kitty mat that looks the same as this one. The electrical unit in the first one I first purchased is approximately the length of the fleecy cover. I was unpleasantly surprized to discover that the heating unit in the newly purchased mat is only a small square, leaving approximately 2/3rds of the total mat surface unheated. I returned it immediately and purchased a competing brand that heats the entire bed surface (or close to it). My two arthritic and very elderly cats (17 and 18 years old) love their heated beds and stretch out full-length. I don't think they would be as comfortable if they had to curl up tight to get the benefit of the heated area."
1,"Flimsy, poor design, way overpriced","Thermo Kitty Mat--It seems that those of us in search of a heated bed for a convalescing or elderly pet are a captive market. This unit is a case in point. The exterior shell is a zippered fleece fabric pad with a thin piece of foam folded inside. The heating unit is a simple low wattage element encased in a plastic cover. That's it. Not only is there no thermostat control, there's not even an on/off switch--you have to plug/unplug the unit to turn it on or off. That's a pretty basic design flaw. This would be a bit of a ripoff at half the price; unfortunately, from what I can tell, it's more the rule than the exception. Every heated pet bed I've looked at is similarly flimsy in design and construction and outrageously overpriced. Anyway, you've been warned..."
4,"Yes small heat pad, but the Cat loves it.","My Kitty pad wasn't only 20% heated, it was more, but not the full 100%. Maybe it was a different model. 'Lucy' loves it, even tho it's Oct and 80'F+. She spreads as much of her under body, chin and neck over it. She does localize herself to the center as that is where the interior heat pad is.She's on it right now.By the way I wish I bought it on Amazon. I got mine at Petco WeHo CA for $50. Duh"
5,Awesome,This this the best thing I've ever bought for my cat! I no longer feel guilty about keeping my thermosat set very low. Once she discovered that it got warm (and it does get very warm) when she laid on it this mat became her favorite place. Worth every penny.
3,good morning starshine cd,"i purchased this cd over 10 years ago at a used cd store.after listening to the tracks""good morning starshine""and""jean""the only 2 songs that became popular,i can't truthfully say these are the originals.they sound like re-recordings to me.i remember these songs as they recieved lots of airplay at the time(1969)and they just sound different.maybe someone can clarify this recording."
3,Just for the jaco fans,"i bought this just to see Jaco, instead all I saw were Las Vegas lights and James Dean. What was Joni thinking!!?? There are places where we get a good look at Jaco and his bass playing, but I was disappointed in the frequency of them"
1,MUSTACHE ON THE MONA LISA,"THE VARIOUS BS, NON-CONCERT FOOTAGE MIXED IN WITH THE MUSICAL PERFORMANCE ABSOLUTELY RUINED THIS DVD FOR ME. AS IT WENT FROM SONG TO SONG, I KEPT WAITING TO SEE WHAT WOULD BE DONE NEXT TO SCREW THINGS UP. THE CONCERT ITSELF WAS GREAT, AND I WILL BUY IT IMMEDIATELY IF A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THIS DVD IS RELEASED, ONE THAT STICKS TO THE EVENTS ON STAGE."
2,Music great - video sucks,"DON'T BUY THIS DVD - get the CD!The music is amazing. Mitchell and her world-class backup band create one of the best concert albums ever.The video on the other hand features poor production values. The camera work is amateurish and the editing is awful. Why did Mitchell consent to releasing such sub-standard representation of an amazing concert?I almost cried when it got to the jam during The Dry Cleaner from Des Moines and saw nothing but crappy shots of the Las Vegas strip.Now, both Jaco and Michael Brecker are gone. This video could have been a great video record of their talents, but no, it's a cheesy music video that largely ignores the fact that some of the greatest musicians in the world were on stage."
3,Great musicians backing a great song writer/singer,"Are you kidding me, Pat Metheny's Bright Size Life band with Jaco backing Joni Mitchell. How could this not be anything but great? Well the picture quality even for DVD is just awful and the audio is good but not great. What a shame. Really great musicians playing music from another time and place. If you like Pat, Jaco or Joni, you will want this disc even with all it's flaws."
1,"great music, lame video, and frustrating to Jaco fans","worst edited concert video i've ever seen. static, boring long shots of the visually un-inspiring singer...singing. lazily strumming a guitar...with one of the most unique and amazingly talented back up bands ever assembled, just off-screen...i watched this stupid video on fast forward, stopping for the rare moments when Jaco got some screen time. precious and few. even when his playing is being featured, like with his solo melody intro to one of Joni's tunes, the viewer is treated instead to some pointless shots of the audience! how do you decide to make a video this bad? and as others have mentioned the lame art school ""concept"" inserts, i won't dwell on them. but it's almost funny, it's so bad.about 5 minutes total of good Jaco footage, plus his solo feature. for that, i'm glad i've got it, but what a disappointment!"
4,2 words: Jaco Pastorius,"I never really dug Joni Mitchell, talented vocalist and songwriter that she...""may be."" I mean, I kind of got over trying to be ""hip"" or ""cool"" right around the time I got busted (don't ask). But I did see her/hear her shrieking behind Neil Young in ""The Last Waltz,"" and...well. But evidentally, this ""negativism"" is all my trip: I mean, just LOOK who the Lady's surrounded herself with, Metheny, Mayes, Brecker, Alias....but, truth is, I only wanted a DVD with Jaco on it. Sorry. And, from what I've read, he features quite prominently on this, so...well, I ordered it, it hasn't arrived yet, so maybe I'll comment further when I experience the DVD. Well, folks, it arrived today. I'm very happy with it, ESPECIALLY Jaco's solo part! But back to the ""Star,"" really, I could have done without the bizarre chording and the annoying videos (this ain't MTV, dammit!). And, curious me, I wuz just wondering if, maybe, Joni spent some quality time on the dark side of the moon with Yoko Ono..."
5,At last,Its wonderful to be able to watch what is one of Joni's best concerts. She is as wonderful as always.
5,"Excellent, but too short!","This DVD is wonderful; a real ""must have"". Metheny, Pastorius, and company are terrific with Joni; however, the DVD (a short single disc) should have at least provided us with some bonus footage or interviews of participants from this legendary tour. There must be some great additional film buried in a vault somewhere. What a shame."
5,Great show. Joni at her best.,It's a great great concert. I have nothing to complain. But Joni's fans don't be sad cos I just found out the DVD version of the show has been listed on eBay. Cheers.
2,Directions Lacking,"I'm an electrical engineer, my girlfriend is a librarian. She wanted to know more about what I do, so I bought this Alarm clock kit and a digital dice kit (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001234Y6A/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title Pocket Dice (Kit Requires Soldering Assembly) # K-28). I recommend the dice over the alarm clock.The assembly directions were barely adequate - they are in several languages and about half a sentence for each step. However, she was able to piece it together. We still have no idea how to set the time, other than to wait until noon or midnight to put in the batteries. There is no schematic provided, so it was impossible for me to help or for her to learn how it works. The actual soldering itself is reasonably easy, and good for a beginner.In summary, this kit is only good for practicing soldering - you will not learn any electronics and you will not gain a useful alarm clock."
3,led clock kit,needed clock kit for physics project. this kit had components that had to be soldered. learned a lot about soldering. disappointed that the clock did not come with the power cord. did all that work and can only use battery backup to see if it works.
4,Good sound quality,"I initially bought an Archos Jukebox 20 GB. Really liked it. Compact design, easy PC interface. I plugged it in a USB port of my win2000 PC and it worked right away without additional driver installation. File transfer using window file manager was as convenient as can be. But the only problem was that it doesn't come with any line-out port. Sound quality with a headphone was OK although not great. When I play music with my Bose speakers, it was a bummer. Since I knew my Bose was good, I could only conclude that Archos need to improve its sound quality. Unfortunately sound quality is my #1 priority. I reluctantly returned the unit back to the store.Now I got a Nomad 3. The sound quality thru either headphone or speakers is nearly as good as CD players. I don't like the bulky design and software. But afterall, it's the music that I want. I think I will stay with it."
1,OK till it stopped working after 10 months,"Aside from being big and bulky, I was somewhat happy with this jukebox. After a brief 9 and a half months, it stopped working. I was getting an error message saying firmware problem and unable to listen to anything because the machine would not boot up. Customer service then mislead me into sending back the unit to be fixed or repaired. This was not the case- they wanted $200 to fix a 10 month old unit. I am thoroughly disgusted with this company and their support. I would recommend every person buying any MP3 player stay away from CREATIVE and their NOMAD & JUKEBOX products."
4,I'm SO happy with this...,"I've had the Nomad Jukebox III for 5 months now. I love it. No problems with it. It installed and ran easily - I was using it within minutes.Lots of storage, interface took some getting used to, sound quality is great, battery life is good...(the additional battery pack is extremely helpful - I find I only charge every 10-14 days)It's quite durable - In fact, several months ago, I tripped on a sidewalk and my precious Jukebox crashed and went skidding (face down) across the road! I thought for sure this would be the end of it. There were a couple of ugly scratches on it, but it started right up and there hasn't been any side effects.I do have one complaint: you can't search for a song in a playlist while it's playing. Hitting the search button brings you back to the main ""music library"" search.This is a great MP3 player if you're looking for lots of storage. I can't recommend it enough. This was my first MP3 player, and it's been a great experience."
2,crash over and over,"Very unhappy. Requires lots of re-sets. always carry a paper clip to reset (I do!).The upgraded firmware seems to help, but does not solve completely. Creative still has some problems to figure out. Works fine between crashes."
1,"Features don't work, have fun downloading updates","1st and foremost: Creative's tech support .... After 6 times contacting them, I received the same response and did exactly what they told me to do. I'm rather computer literate and have never had a problem with any computers/software/periphals like this .... I'm sure it will be nice if I ever get it to work, but after spending nearly 5 hours uninstalling and reinstalling, downloading and installing updates, the stupid thing still doesn't work right. Be on the lookout, I'll be selling it on Ebay, NR."
2,Not durable.,Don't even look to hard at this thing or it will break. And creative labs doesn't care.... they only have a 3 month warrentee.
4,Dynamite,"If you love music on the go and/or for keepsake purposes, editing etc..but especially for partying..this contraption is great!! With headphones or a great set of computer speakers, sounds great and VERY user friendly!!"
4,Best player I've owned,"I've owned 3 flash players before (Rio 300, 500, Samsung Yepp 64MB). None of them compare to the CL NJ3, never have I been able to take all of my music with me. Fortunately, all those warnings from other people about XP freezing with the Firewire is BS. I had absolutely no problem with the Firewire and watched the 3GB of my music go by in 5 minutes... Amazing! As well, the software is better than any other I have used, very simple. Transfers songs like a Palm Pilot transfers information, using a sync. Playlists work great, too. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the fact that the title of the song selected doesn't scroll when you're browsing, it's a pain when you have a bunch of remixes of one song. I can get past that. All in all, this is a great player."
3,"OK, but not ripe.","Well, it plays, and transfers files. But why on earth could it not also be a USB hard drive? I don't really mind the clumsy file transfer mechanism, but it appears you can't store a folder tree in there, only individual files all in the same folder, what's the use in that? And why is the FM wired remote out of stock for the past half a year, at least (sold on eBay for twice the retail price)?It would also be only reasonable that you could store *songs* in folders as well, and navigate by folder *as well as* by ID tags.So an OK player, did not die on me yet, but needs work."
2,Not great,"This thing is supposed to sound great. Well, first of all, it comes with what I consider pieces of junk for headphones. Try out the Radio Shack Titanium magnet portable headphones (the best portable headphones I have ever heard) and you'll see what I mean. Also, this unit has NO volume. It is adequate for in the home, but if you were on a plane or a bus, it could easily be overpowered. I have owned the Iomega Hip Zip player which blows this one out of the water. The Iomega is so loud, it rivals a home stereo. The only advantage is storage space for the Creative Jukebox. I returned it in 24 hours. It is great for a music junkie, but if you want the best sounding unit out there, shop around. I'll stick with my Iomega player."
2,would not work with MusicMatch Jukebox; nonstandard charger,It is nice to have 20 GB of music and 22 hours of battery life (with an optional 2nd battery). But I couldn't get the jukebox to work with MusicMatch Jukebox and therefore was forced to used Creative's extremely painful software. More painful was losing the AC adaptor. It is a 5V adaptor with a non-standard connector. So you can't go into Radio Shack and get a replacement.
1,Unreliable,This jukebox gets worse with time. The software simply does not work or something is wrong with the sites downloads. Very complicated. Cannot transfer music.
1,Great -- if its works; purchase at your own risk,"The wide disparity in reviews illustrates that this is a great product -- if it works. Unfortunately, it quit working for me after the short 90-day warranty expired, as it apparently has for a number of others. The player would hang after a few minutes of playing. Creative tech support was worthless -- did little more than read the support faqs and put me through hours of clean-ups, reinstalling firmware, reformatting -- and finally advising me that the problem must be my MP3s. If you're lucky, like many of the reviewers, this unit is outstanding. If you're not, you'll end up spending many frustrating hours fiddling with this thing and ultimately you'll have an expensive paperweight. Like many other computer products, the Nomad Jukebox III isn't reliable enough for a consumer product."
1,planned obsolescence?,"I purchased this item for my teenaged son for the holidays. He used it for exactly two months, and since it was his most prized possession he was very careful with it. By yesterday, January 31st, the power button (to turn it off and on) broke and will no longer do anything but shakily move up and down when you press it.Unfortunately, I ordered it well in advance of Christmas so the warrenty (90 days only) expired a month ago. I should have known better than to purchase an expensive electronics item that only came with a 3 month warranty.While it worked it was great. But it has cost me $150.00 a month for my son to listen to music and now it is useless. I suggest you wait until Creative offers a better warranty and stands behind its products before purchasing this.Everyone who has been shafted should complain to Creative. Maybe eventually they will listen. Shame on Creative for not caring more about its customers."
3,Good and Bad,"On the good side, it does sound good. I haven't put enough into it to flex it's capacity, but time will tell.On the Bad side (this is why I wrote the review):1. They DESPERATELY need a shuffle or random play feature. I am getting tired of hear tunes in the same order.2. I could not get the CDDB to work with the Playcenter software. I click on it and nothing happens. I spent several weeks trading e-mails with Creative Labs. They ignored my information and sent me canned responses that had nothing to do with my symptoms. They finally won the battle of wills and I am typing in all my track info. I am a manager of an IT support staff and I would advise Creative Labs to review their procedures and trim the problem managers or face a severe loss of market share. Be warned if you try to use their support. It is way below what I expect of a company like this."
4,"Creative makes a new sequal and its better than 1, or 2","when i first got the NOMAD Jukebox 3 for my birthday i though that this is the best thing ever and it is exept one ""error"" is that somethimes when you are viewing all the songs then somethimes it displays the same song twice. another one of these ""errors"" is that the included headphones are uncomfertable. These are the only two errors that i have found yet..."
1,pure trash,"I've never reviewed an item before, but I've never had a product like this. Please check the readers reviews at ZDNET ; I did, but somehow thought it wouldn't happen to me.It did.I can't judge the performance because it has never worked. Customer support is nil. I wasted hours of my life trying to get it to work (it kept saying ""player not connected""). Finally, they sent me a replacement. Guess what ""PLAYER NOT CONNECTED !!!"" I have never been this frustrated in my life. If you read any review on this product, let it be this one. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. STAY AWAY, FAR FAR AWAY. I would hesitate to even look at the ""player"" too long.It can happen to you. Trust me."
2,I expected better from Creative.,Sound Quality is mediocre.Headphones are uncomfortable to wear.Scroll Select Wheel is a pain to use for a prolonged period of time. It'sjust not comfortable to use or big enough. I like the Rio Riot so much more because it is better in every aspect I mentioned above.
3,"Good feature, but poor portability","I bought this a few months ago, Iat first, i think it was a perfect device, but later on, i found that the battery life is much shorter than the manufacturer claims, 11 hours, but mine runs only about 3 hours non-nonstop playback. Also everytime I charge the unit, the power button is malfunctioned, also the battery is still empty or not full after charging. It's also big and heavy, also you can't rely on its battery, you need electricity from your house."
5,Strange Museum series,"My daughter is bilingual and usually doesn't like to read books in English. In an effort to boost her english reading skills, I introduced her to these books as part of the Hooked on Phonics series. These books managed to ""hook"" her and I found her reading these books for fun. They are great books, highly engaging, and take the kids back to a time in history. I highly recommend these books."
4,Great Guitar Work,"This is a very unique effort of combining intricate, blues-guitar riffs with the New Age music genre. Neal plays unbelievably well from start to finish of this double CD--a very rich compilation of his style and ability."
5,Not What I Expected,"I have always liked Neal's playing. He seems to be different than your run of the mill guitar star. Sure, he can play fast and heavy, but he has always been more musical than most others. That being said, I don't know why I was as surprised as I was. I still expected much more overt flash than I got at first listen.Its there, but in different ways. His talent as a producer and composer is very evident in this collection. Spectacular soundscapes. Very interesting noises and tones. Strong compositions. Good, solid, inventive guitar work as well. Very highly recommended. A rare 5star cd."
3,Electric World,"This two disk album is hot & cold. The first disk is interesting and accomplished. It does have a bit of safety to it in that many sounds & layers have been around for a while, but the overall composition is satisfying. Disk 2 on the other hand seems to be ideas that need further development. Some have potential but lack attention to detail thus rendering them incomplete. Overall I give the album a three out of five and with a reasonable price of under six dollars there is real value here..................Ben Fuentes"
4,It's Big.,"It's big. You might not have time for this much perfection. Every guitar note has been purified by some magical studio magicalness. If you're looking for raw it ain't here. However, I've listened to it enough to think it may have afflicted my playing. Kind of like that Craig Chaquico guy. I have to say ""Wow. I don't play anything like that."" Both on Higher Octave, of course. I think actually that's where I heard Buckethead too. On one of their samplers. Anyway, two discs of this is a bit much, even though there are quite likable tunes, even memorable ones. But spread it out. Maybe over a few months."
5,Awesome,"The incredible Power of Prayer is a great tool for intercession and insight when praying. I have this book in my handbag always i just LOVE it, and I will encourage anyone that needs to improve their prayer life to get it. Sherron"
4,Good Book,Very good book. Would help build and reshape your faith. A very believable person and story...recommended for anyone who is feeling the perils of life and is looking for the light.
3,Not very educational.,"I am very new to the world of aromatherapy. I thought this book would give me more information on the how the essentials oils would work with each other. I also was looking for more information on how to make my own beauty products. This book gave a lot of recipes but dealing more with medical disorders. I was surprised that all of the recipes only had 3 ingredients. For some of the natural products that I have purchases, most have a lot more than 3 ingredients and I know good results can be obtain from only 2 ingredients as well. I rated this book a 3 because it had a lot of recipes not because of the additional content in the book. This book was somewhat helpful on some of the essential oil history (which I had already known). For the most part, the book did not meet my expectations."
2,Not suited for homeschooling.,"I sent this back as soon as I realized the book requires so many other resource books in order to make complete lessons. There are no definate instructions given on the activities, just ideas and page numbers referencing other little house/pioneer books. It's seems it would be helpful in a classroom setting where standardized lesson plans and grading are necessary because the guide contains a large amount of information on evaluation, that is if you can actually execute the activity.There also really isnt a whole lot of coloring/activity pictures, the ones given are quite boring and not worth keeping the entire guide for.I'm unable to give any recommendations as I have yet to find a really useful Little House guide, especially one that could be used in a homeschool setting."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Old songs from a young J.L.Hooker. I never listen to this CD. Glad I bought it on sale. The CD has some decent guitar, but I don't like the chosen songs.Not a favorite of mine."
3,Not that good...,"There are much better John Lee Hooker collections than this one. Half of the songs on this disc are early (pre-1960) JLH, and it's relatively short. Unless you especially like Hooker's early work, I would find a different collection. I much prefer Hooker's later work in which his deep, growling voice is fully developed. I would instead recommend the wonderful The Best Of John Lee Hooker 1965-1974, which has a lot more music from Hooker's best period."
1,Pathetic...,"Most of the movie is either talking heads or irrelevant slide show (of course, Egypt, South America etc.), and sometimes talking heads with irrelevant background. Say, a man walking on some indescriptive street and a voice behind tells who is he or what have he told some time ago.Plenty of accusations to the ""official science"" that they don't listen to a reason and don't want any proofs. Not much of actual proofs. It reminds me mostly amateurish informercial where participants pitching how great they are before pithing the product (in this case, their books, probably).The only plausible proof of their point that I heard in the movie was that many stones are done with a machinery precision, impossible manually. However, they were too busy complaining about ""official science"" and pitching how great they are to really demonstrate this machine precision."
5,A pitty it wasn't in theatres.,"FOP isn't just for kids. I'm in college & girls there love it! I never get sick of reruns^.^ I would tottaly have gone to see this at theatres, alone or with a horde of teens. I hope they make another movie^__^I also reccomend Spongebob, rumor is they're making a Spongebob movie for 2004."
4,great movie... wanted more from the dvd,"Okay, maybe I was expecting a bit too much from a DVD that was rushed out, it was available for sale 3 days after the Nick premiere. I loved the movie when it was on Nick and I couldn't wait for the DVD because I wanted more information and more stuff. The DVD comes with a commentary done by Cosmo and Wanda, and a few behind the scenes specials. This DVD would have been perfect if it also included commentary by the writers and/or Butch Hartman, maybe behind the scenes of the actors who do the voices, or deleted scenes. And also where are the episodes of this show on DVD?? I would love seasons but compilation DVD's with lots of extras would be great too."
3,"Great movie, false advertisement","Since I love the Fairly Oddparents, I loved this movie. Even though the parodies at the beginning were kind of unnecessary (watching the commercials I thought it would be throughout the movie). But seriously, people shoudn't get upset about it not being released theatrically. The critics would hate it, and it probably wouldn't do well in the box-office anyway, plus it would've taken longer to make.The reason I give this DVD 3 stars instead of 5 is because of the special features. The only storyboards you see are the ones for the song. And I was hoping that Butch Hartman would do the audio commentary, not Cosmo and Wanda! That would please the naive little kids but not someone who's interested in the making of a series/movie. The behind the scenes are crappy too.Still a good movie, though."
5,Finally a Fairly Oddparents movie!!!,"I'm referring to the premiere on nick. It was great! It was hillarious! I must say though, it could be longer! The CGI was amazing. I suggest you see it. Your WISH will come true !!!"
5,A Great Adventure,"Nickelodeon finally makes a good movie. Abra-Catastrophe is the best nicktoons movie yet. Timmy Turner recieves a magic muffin for his 1 year fairy-versery. If a bite is taken from the muffin, that person is granted a rule free wish. Anyone. Timmy loses the muffin and it is obtained by a monkey named Bippy. The monkey wishes for the world to be a big jungle and Timmy's god parents, Cosmo and Wanda, become his. As Timmy tries to get the muffin back, it lands into the hands of the evil Mr. Crocker, who is obsessed on proving the existence of fairy godparents. Crocker tries to take over the world. Can Timmy save the world before Crocker destroys it? A great movie, leaves you at the edge of your seat."
4,It's a very good DVD but where's the bonus episodes,This is a good DVD but the bonus episodes are missing. Maybe they didn't have time to put the bonus episodes in. Anyway still a good DVD.
1,Overrated show,"I can't believe everyone likes this show, it is the most annoying show with pointless stories that are filled with stupidity. I'd go and watch SpongeBob, he's a cool sponge that's hilarious."
3,"""Bassin' With The Pros"" - A little too much basic stuff.","Bassin' With The Pros would be an excellent book if you're new to bass fishing or at least new to reading about it. I've read numerous books on the subject and found myself skipping over entire chapters in this book just because there was nothing new to learn.Also, there aren't many actual technique tips from the pros. You'd be much better off with ""Bassin' With The Best"" for technique help."
1,Silly not sexy,"These stories are just silly- a 14 million dollar poodle, a James Bond wanna be and a computer programmer. The sex is not hot, the characters are flat- these stories obviously can't stand alone, so put them in a longer, more expensive edition. Disappointment."
4,Sumptuous,"A collection of three romantic stories; the boys do play with expensive toys. The first has an extravagant spoilt dog. The second is with lavish gadgets. The third is a prospect of a multimillion computer program. In the third story, the woman is actually the rich one, owning stores all around the world. The second tale is James-Bond-ish. The first involves an appealing French figure. The similarity between the three stories - they are all hot and bothered on the same subject. Also, all the men are over six feet. And, all the women are beautiful, possessing flat abdomens. A fast read on a lazy Sunday."
5,Nice shirt,Very nice shirt. Has a pretty sheen to the material. Hangs well when worn. Had a few wrinkles that came right out when hing in ghe bathroom with a hog shower running.
4,The Shirts,These shirts are beautiful and fit well. The only issue with them is don't iron with too much water in your steam iron. If drops fall on shirt it will stain the shirt.
2,If you like ugly shirts.....,"Let me start off by saying the only reason I bought this shirt is because I had to. My friend decided it was a really good idea for all his groomsmen to wear this shirt for his wedding. I'm pretty sure he'd never seen it in person or on someone. It's REALLY red people, it's shiny too. Make sure you see on someone before you decide to invest. This would be a great shirt under a vest or if you wear a jacket over it with a nice black tie perhaps. In my case though we had none of that....just wore it as an open collared shirt. We looked like everything from a Mexican boy band, to bull fighters, to waiters, to rejects from Chip N Dale's....As for the shirt itself, it's fine. I fit well. It was comfy. You could see us from miles away. So there you have it, you've been warned!"
3,not very good,I paid 18.99 plus shipping for this shirt. I am not very happy with the quality of this shirt. May be I just got what I paid for. The tailoring is very bad. The cloth is just average. They are made in Thailand.I will not buy another of these.
5,Great no iron shirt,"I have been buying these shirts for my husband for several years. They are truely no iron. They wash up beautifully and last a long time. The regular cut is rather full, but I think they are offering them in a fitted style as well. I would give this shirt 6 stars if I could! A little pricey, but worth every penny."
5,REAL wrinkle-free,"Too many shirts are labeled ""wrinkle free"" or ""easy care"" or ""no iron"" but come out of the dryer needing at least a touch up with an iron. Not these, baby! They come out completely and utterly free of wrinkles, ready to wear out on the town or to a business meeting (okay, so they are a bit shiny, but the lighter colors are not noticeably so, especially under a sport coat). These are truly a must-have for lazy men everywhere!"
5,Geoffrey Beene Wrinkle Free Sateen Regular Fit Dress Shirt Black 16.5 36/37,"The shirt came relatively quick, and it was as promised. Has a good color and fits well. I have a skinny neck and long arms, so Geoffrey Beene is pretty much my go-to brand for dress shirts, as they always seem to have my size."
3,Good shirt for the price!,"Is a very good product for the low cost. It is okay to work and casual moments. On the other hand, it is too wide and bright for my likes."
2,Husband didn't like it!,I give it a 2 star because the person I purchased it for did not like it and I had to return it. He didn't like the red part (which I take full responsibility for ordering) or that the shirt was shiny. The shirt is fine if you like red and with a sateen shine.It is exactly as it is advertised!!
4,Nomad JB3 Leather Pouch,"I am quite pleased with both the quality and workmanship on this product.All the openings allow for simple access to the various controls and sockets without any difficulty. In fact they matched up almost perfectly. I would have preferred to see the gap a little wider for the scrolling wheel, as bigger fingers may have a minor problems with negotiating it otherwise.The belt clip seems quite seviceable and should perform its function well. My preference would have been for it to be slightly wider so as to provide some more stability.Overall the product looks good and is well worth the money for the protection it affords."
5,Look at amazon.de for a cheaper offer,"Just a short hint:Have a look at amazon.de for a cheaper offer. Since I'm from Germany, I can't sell books on amazon.com.PED 2001, Springer, unused, 75 Euro + shipping, i.e. around 100 to 110 USD altogether."
4,Beautiful but I'm not sure about the steel,I had to have this knife because it was so beautiful. I'm just not sure the steel holds an edge well enough. I'm no expert but it seems to dull easily.
3,not what i needed,My sons father passed away after not being in my sons life for years. This book is definately for a kid who was close with their father. It was no help to my son.
3,"Good documentary, terrible interviewer","The documentary itself is pretty good. It's a sad story that will make you cry.Alexandra Pelosi is a terrible interviewer. I was appalled at some of the stupid, insensitive questions she asked these poor children. Paraphrasing: ""Why would God want you to be homeless?"" What a jerk. She needs to stay more behind the scenes and let someone with common sense ask questions."
3,60 Minutes did a better job,60 minutes went to Florida did a similar piece it was shorter and more to the punch. This film is slow and is very agenda driven. I work with a non-profit in Orange County that helps motel families and this does hit home.
1,very sad sometimes to love my country,"I bought this dvd after seeing it on tv. I was angry, because there are sooooooo many jobs outsourced that moms can do at home in their kitchen and be there when their kids arrive from school. Att, Chase,Sprint, Expeirian, Equifax all send their Call center jobs to India or the Phillipines. I would work 4 hours a day and i'd rather have my call center in a prison than give Habeeb my social when I call equifax. I hate this. This is crazy, we have to do better as a people. Care for one another and have empathey for the poor, the rich, the greedy and even the naive. I do, I may finish last but I love my man-kind and I will pray, do for who I can, and not verbally beath down those who try."
4,Bad description,"The description says ""8GL Glo-Lime Ultra-Fine Marking Chalk, 12-pack, 8 ounces"" and ""1-each"" but all you get is ONE small green chalk. For the price that was fine but I would like the different colors and the option is not given. Product is fine but the seller has some work to do to make the sale clear. The picture also shows multiple colors, so the description ""1-each"" makes the buyer think that is what they get. False advertising."
1,Mean Men: The Sons of Ma Barker,Very poorly written. The author knows a lot about an assortment of criminals but the book does not suit the title. It does not focus on the sons of Ma Barker. It is so poorly written that you find yourself getting lost because the subject jumps around so much. The publisher did a very poor job of editing. The book is so full of glaring typographical errors that it becomes distracting.
1,Lacking a few important items,"The Atlas offers some background and nice maps. It is however outdated. List level of mobs in Innothule Swamp as 1-26. The Black Ravagers were added in May of this year and are level 55.No Planes of Power Maps. If this was the case, why not release it ahead of Planes of Power. Not even the mapes of the Plane of Tran. or Plane of Knowledge.No Port locations to the Planes are listed, or even the port stones to Jaggged Pine from Surefall Glade or Black."
1,Nice but not an Atlas,"Never be lost in EverQuest again,that's what they say but if you use this Atlas as a guide you'll never figure out where you are. This book is very nice and it's filled with losts of pretty pictures with good useful imformation about each zone but it's not a guide to keep beside your computer while you play.While the maps are pretty, they are small with little detail. But the major problem with this book is that the zones are listed alpabeticaly for the whole world, I mean you don't put Alaska next to Afganastan! This is a nice book to read through in your spare time but if you need maps to use while you play go to one of the EQ web sites and print what you need."
3,EQ atlas a nice addition for the EQ RPG,"The maps might not contain any grids, it does have lots of information about all the zones. This added information is more usable if you also play the EQ RPG. So you can show your players all the great locations in the world of norrath and beyond"
1,Why buy this when you can get it all on the web?,Seems rather excessive to have to pay $$$ to get a book that details the zones in the game when you can go to any number of websites and get the same content.
2,Almost a complete waste,"Not much for your money here; ""Atlas"" is just a collection of little facts and tid-bits about the zones of EQ. This collection would actually be quite useful except for the fact that almost all of the information it offers is readily accessible from a number of EQ web sites. The only thing going for ""Atlas"" is that it offers players with poor connections the opportunity to find the information they seek without waiting forever on their browsers.Bottom line : You will likely want to save your money."
3,For PnP EQ only...,"This book is not for your average EQ player. Its not a prima guide to spawns or anything along those lines. If you want that sort of detail goto eqatlas.What it is useful for is those who are starting a EQ Pen and Paper game. Or designing a mud or NWN game based on EQ. This is an invaluable (if a little lackluster in the imagination department) resource for the lore of the game. Lots of plot and player hooks spread throughout.The maps are also quite nice, if somewhat small. Would love to see a REAL atlas that just had the maps on large glossy A4 with all the landmarks displayed on a separate map that you could write on."
1,very poor maps,"Do not buy this book, it has very poor mapsyou can find better maps and information online"
1,Abysmal!,"The maps are next to worthless. No key locations are marked, some entries/exits are only marked in the most general way, and the 3-D areas are hard to follow."
1,Disappointed Atlas,"If you just can't find anything else for the Everquest player in your life this book will atleast earn you some spouse points. Maps in the game are based upon and X,Y coordinate system (North/South & East/West), which for some reason, this atlas neglected to incorporate. Not having this coordinate system makes the maps available online, for free, superior for all but the newest players. As a fan and long time player I found the EverQuest Atlas a disappointment."
4,Good if you play for the storyline.,"This is by no means a cheat guide, if that's what you want I suggest you look elsewhere. This book is geared mainly toward the few people who play this game for the ROLEPLAYING aspect, which 99% of players seem to have overlooked and play this game as if it was another Quake or Unreal...Anyway, this book gives lots of interesting information on the history of Norrath, zone info, NPC info, and beautiful maps. The maps are not like the grid-based, satellite view maps with mob locations and spawn times like you would find on most cheat websites.If you prefer to roleplay and not just run from one zone to another killing certain mobs just to get your current quest item, then this book is for you. If all you want out of the game is to max out your level and get your epic in the shortest time possible, you're better off visiting a cheat site. Or better yet, go play a Final Fantasy and save money and bandwidth."
2,No Grids,"Pretty pictures, but none of the maps have grids. Therefore, it's not useful for in-game travel. Dangers, benefits, lore, etc. is nice though."
1,Buyer Beware,"Well, I guess Sony just couldn't stand the online entrepreneurs producing maps of this great game so they decided to publish a paper version and sell it.Well, you would think that the company that owns the game would know the content of the game, but they evidently don't. If you are a novice gamer, please do not buy this book as a guide to the world of EQ. The maps are grossly incorrect in respect to locations of landmarks, camps, town, druid rings, you name it. The zone levels listed are most incorrect and the ""dangers within"" background stories are erroneous.Ever since Sony shoved Verant Interactive out of the picture, there has a been a succession of poorly executed attempts to milk the EQ cash cow. This atlas is one of the worst.Please don't make the mistake I made when I preordered this terrible boot and waste of money."
1,maps,"So there are no Meridians or any other orienteering guides other than landmarks? I guess those of you that think that having a location grid would be a cheat guide have never read a REAL map. I'd rather spend my money on the ink and paper on that ""other"" site."
2,OK for a Visual Ref.,This Book is OK if you are looking for a visual reference. I have found several errors in this book for example the Dreadlands showed the MOBS to be between 1 and 10 in my copy of this book. When in fact the mobs in Dreadlands are in the 30+ category. I have found several other errors also.Beware double check any information this book gives you!
1,New: Useless and Incomplete,"I'll spare you the rant from spending money to carry this home.Plane of Knowledge and Plane of Tranquility are only ""maps"" from the new expansion that made the list of ""over 170 full-color maps"" that were said to include them. Ring binding this 573 page tome would be a good idea, if it was useful in the game.3 dimensional renderings of zones does not a map make. I suppose I should be greatful for the compass pointing North. There are no coordinates/grid to help in using the /loc in game. The renderings are not to scale. Minimum points of interests aren't pointed out. Even the few maps in the ""official guide"" books have more information on the zones they cover.If you are looking for pretty pictures and little more, this is the book for you. If you need zone intel, including scaled maps and coordinates/grid, then I recommend you save your money or consider making a contribution to one of the web sites dedicated to EQ Maps/Atlases."
2,To buy or not to buy?,"From the information i have available, this atlas will not have their maps layed out in a 'Grid' fashion. Most maps in real life have ""grid coordinates"" of longitude and latitude, so why not this atlas??For the Advanced and Expert Everquest gamers, the maps will be more of a hinderance and makes the Atlas more or less useless imho, as most tend to use grid locations to find out were they are or were they want to go.For the Beginer or Intermediate, this Atlas will contain much usefull information about zones/places they will travel.Overview: the zone information in it will be helpful but if they had put in a little extra effort and did the maps in grid fashion, this would be a hot item. As it is, its more of a collectors/newbie item than anything else."
1,Please save your money...,"If you're an Everquest enthusiast, you've probably already bought it. An enthusiast would find the background stories to each area very interesting. This is why the guide fails so miserably. You get a roughly drawn map with only 3-7 vaguely located places on each map, inaccurate monster levels for each map, and one to three full pages of background for each location. The histories will do nothing to enhance your gameplay. Any useful information is encoded into cryptic passages that start with ""There are rumors..."" I wish for my sake it had been better and I hope for your sake you now know better."
2,Just a bit short...,"To make it simple...NO GRIDLINES! Not even a mention of the coordinates of important landmarks and zone gates.Some zones they 'skimped' i.e. Skyshrine has 7 pages (one per level) but Vek's Lab..one very crowded one.Now, it is true that it's nice to HAVE a map of some of the more nasty zones, but IMHO a site like EQATLAS does the player a greater service by adding a grid and adding a list of notable locations.The area where the book does shine is in the rich description of the history of the zone. Nice, but since strict role-play isn't/can't be enforced, this feature is mostly useless...."
1,Ruun of Tarrew Marr,"Do NOT buy this atlas,there are no locations or location grids,the average map size is approx. 4 inches x 4 inches .The pictures of sceens are 2""x 2.5"" , this is all printed on 5 1/2"" x8"" paper in a spiral binder. (tiny). The beastiary is not complete,for listed zones or towns,ie. Frontier Moutains lists only 2 monsters ,(forest giants,goblins). to say the least iam sorry i bought this almost totaly worthless atlas ,,:)Peace, Ruun"
1,I HATE THIS BOOK,This book has got to be the worst book I've ever read. My 10 year old brother writes better stories at school and my mom tends to burn anything he writes. Take my advice....Stay away from this book!
4,"First Authoritative, Honest Text About Mt. Meadows","Juanita Brooks, a life-long southern Utahn, used her considerable native talent, her drive for the truth, and many years of effort to compile this first exhaustive, honest examination of the Mountain Meadows massacre. It is especially impressive given the fact that Ms. Brooks wasn't by vocation a historian or scholar. Her narrative is lucid and complete. Her analysis has proven, in the context of additional investigation, to be principally correct. Throughout it all, Ms. Brooks remained also a faithful LDS (Mormon) woman, in spite of her disappointments with her contemporary LDS church leadership as it related to her investigation. This should be a starting point for any serious student of the Mountain Meadows massacre. Ms. Brooks shows us a world of grays with very human characters whom she places into a carefully resurrected context."
2,Too Biased,"Sally Denton is overly biased in her book. Her motives in writing this book don't seem to be simply for historical preservation or clarity. The book ""Massacre At Mountain Meadows"" by Ronald W. Walker and R.M. Leonard seems to have more accurate sources, instead of hearsay. It lets the facts guide it."
3,Mountain Meadows Massacre,"Well researched and interesting. It was a good documentary on the Mormon early problems in the first days and illuminated the church's reaction to the non-acceptance of their ""position""."
3,good fun,One of the better early SVHIGH editions.This is a fun series and Jessica is inspirationally FUN!..She decides that she would like to try dating 2 different types of boys...sophisticated + hardcore.So she fakes 2 different personalities in a dating service..Magenta..a wild punk.And..Daniella..a french sophisticate who likes opera.
4,"Good opener for Vor: The Maelstrom, but good sci-fi too!","I enjoyed this book. As an owner and collector of the Vor: The Maelstrom game, it enhanced my gaming experience. As an avid reader of science fiction, however, it also seemed to stand on its own. Having a few concurrently developing plotlines showed good reflection of how the world might react in the Vor setting.Even though FASA is now defunct, I'd recommend this as a good read anyway...."
3,Not bad,"The cover was a bit old and overall the product as sold didn't deserve a ""as new"" rating, especially given it was ex-rental. However, the DVD plays fine and without problems so I was reasonably happy. Would prefer more realistic description in future."
2,too long,ZZZzzzzzzzzz 3-4 hrs worth of generic vampires.I tried watching it twice and fell asleep each time. Its too long. gave it an extra star for the blood
2,Disappointing,"This disjointed and floundering remake of the Tobe Hooper directed ratings hit hardly follows Stephen King's novel, and considering all the hype TNT built around the new Salem's Lot upon it's premiere this mini-series is a big disappointment. Rob Lowe is miscast as our hero who returns to his childhood town where vampires are running rampant, while Homicide: Life on the Street vet Andre Braugher is wasted in his role as well. However, old pros James Cromwell and especially Donald Sutherland both shine as they ham it up, and casting Rutger Hauer as Barlow works out extremely well. However, this mini-series never seems to get off the ground when it has an original idea floating around, and by the time it reaches it's drawn out conclusion and a punked out cover of the Rolling Stones' classic tune ""Paint it Black"" kicks in, you'll realize that this movie and the aforementioned cover have something very much in common: they are both pale imitations of the superior originals."
2,To be fair,"Stephen King hasn't been treated well at the movies mostly because of Stephen King. When he's not involved in the adaptation, not acting in, or producing, the movies usually do quite well (The Shining, The Shawshank Redemption, Misery, The Green Mile, Stand By Me, etc.).Having said the above, you can't really blame Stephen for this mess. One of the previous posters was right, this movie went so far off the mark. I watched the earlier version before watching this new version, and it's not a fair comparison. Everyone in the earlier version did a much better job in their roles. I'm not sure why the director felt he had to change so many things. I can understand that certain changes need to be made, but this was ridiculous."
1,West Wing/Homicide: Life On The Street Meet Stephen King!!!,"The West Wing's Sam Seaborn (Rob (B)Lowe) and Homicide: Life On The Street's Detective Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher) team up to battle battle vampires in a bizarre crossover between two of TVs biggest shows! After leaving the White House, Sam Seaborn returns to his native Salem's Lot where unbeknownst to him Det. Frank Pembleton is deep undercover as a homosexual school teacher. Once the enterprising Seaborn realizes vampires are in their midst he enlists Pembleton in a madcap, picaresque adventure to rid the world of the bloodsuckers. Throw in a dash of Donald Sutherland and Six Feet Under's James Cromwell and you'll realize that you've just struck Hollywood gold when you sit down to enjoy this Stephen King extravaganza!"
1,Shoot yourself instead of watching this dumb adaptation,"My girlfriend and I both thought this sucked. Don't waste your time. The writer and director should be taken out, flogged and have their blood drained by brain dead Gen-Xers. They should be prosecuted in the World Court for bad taste. I hope they weren't paid to make this piece of junk. But you know what they say ""Crap is king""."
5,Great movie!,"I have watched this miniseries several times and I never get tired of it. I'm not big on scary movies, but this is just enough thrill to keep me on the edge without scaring me. :)"
1,THE WORST STEPHEN KING NOVEL ADAPTATION EVER MADE!,"I do not understand how this crappy crappy movie gets any good reviews. It destroyed Stephen King's great vampire novel. The plotline from the book has been watered down to the point of very little resemblance. Anyone who says that this trash is any good at all must have some sort of mental problem because it is not good. The Tobe Hooper film from 1979 on the other hand, stayed true to the book, doing it perfect justice, and therefore is thrilling classic horror. This however is just rubbish. The acting is just awful (even for the well-knowns that star here), the special effects are cheap, the scripting is terrible, the fear factor in nonexistent, and everything else about it just plan sucks. My point is to stick with the novel and 1979 film and avoid this disgrace to Stephen King's horror on film entirely."
2,Mostly a waste of potential,"A crappy rewrite that misses the tone ofthe bookand original miniseries. The characters were all made to be more jerky and unlikeable than theoriginal miniseries(except for Straker who was sort of wimped-down a bit). This series is okay, but the '70's one is much better."
2,should have been better!!!!!,"given that the first one was made and broadcast in 1979,this remake should have been better than this. all this one does is to make the 1979 version look even better(and it looked great then and still does today)!in tring to bring the story up to date they have once again missed the feeling of mr.king. the vampire is just part of the overall picture,and please read the novel,like the unlike first mini-series this one misses the boat in making the people come off as real,and the terror of the story is drained(pun ment)away as they don't let you get to know the people! a wasted chance here!!!"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ADAPTION,"Ok...i suppose it can be debated rather hotly as to who is a worse lead, Rob Lowe or David Soul, but overall i would say that the 70's adaption was better than this newer one.Salem's Lot was the first King book I ever read and remains my favorite. Neither movie did a great job of really capturing the terror of the book but I think the original was a bit better. It just seemed a bit creepier and darker.I think most of the leads of the orginal did a better job including James Mason as the vampire servent Straker, who just emitted more evil than the tired Donald Sutherland. Add to that I preferred the nosferatu looking vampire as opposed to the more normal looking Rutger Hauer as Barlow. Again...he was just creepier.There were some effective scenes such as the one in the prison with the vampire crawling through the air duct but overall this production seemed a bit flat."
4,Excellent adaptation,"I was surprisingly pleased with this adaptation of Stephen King's novel 'Salem's Lot. I've always been a big fan of the book (and recently re-read it in reference to King's Dark Tower series), however, I never really enjoyed the original adaptation. Admittedly, this version strays from the novel, notably with regard to Father Callahan. Rob Lowe does well as the title character, author Ben Mears, and the other characters are well developed. An excellent cast of stars, including Andre Braugher, James Cromwell, and Donald Sutherland (though I would have liked to seen him get more screen time). Rutger Hauer is surprisingly good as Kurt Barlow.Give it a shot, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
3,I was left looking for the original,"I was shocked when someone had the balls to mess with and make a remake of ""Psycho"". Since then, nothing is sacred. This movie was so hyped that I thought it would be as good if not better than the original. I was wrong. The changes and attempts to ""update"" the story just were so unneccesary. Rob Lowe did an adequate job in the lead role but this movie was nowhere near as scary as the original. Most of the screen ""scares"" were more surprise that scary. Save your money and find the original with David Soul. You will be glad you did."
3,Good But not Great,"Good movie, but not nearly as good as the origional. Barlow is a jolk in this film compared to the amazing Barlow from the Tobe Hooper film, plus the Toby Hooper Salem's Lot is so much more scarier and has so many more horror elements contained within it, even the skull in the moon at the end with the burning house is so spooky. This film however did have good parts to it and was explained in more detail but it is not nearly as spooky as it should have been, too much explaining and not enough development. Over all 3/10 worth watching but not nearly as amazing as the origional which is a 10/10 spook fest."
3,David Soul got it right in '79.,"The original miniseries with Mr. Soul and the rest was right on the money with their 1979 effort. This updated version was lacking the suspense and the outright horror of some scenes. James Mason was sorely needed in the role of Straker. Don't get me wrong Donald Sutherland is a good actor, he was just horribly miscast in this role. Rob Lowe was very un-convincing as the man with all the secrets and some of the answers, Ben Mears. That role belongs to Mr.Soul now. Also noticeably absent were the special effects. They had good ones on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, why not use them here? All in all this is a good time waster. But if you want genuine thrills and chills, rent or buy the original. It still rules after all these years."
5,It's about time.,"So often when raising our children we turn to the ways of the world and then wonder why their values end up reflecting the degrading morality apparent in today's society. This book is a powerful tool for parents, and cuts right to the heart of the matter. It will challenge you to take an active role in your child's life and to truly consider the priorities you exemplify in your parenting style."
5,It was funny and helpful!,"When my minister told me to get this book, I thought, ""Oh no, parenting books always make me feel like a slime ball before I finish the first chapter."" Instead, I loved it! It was funny, easy to read, and made me think about what my kids need most from me. Thanks for helping me become a better dad! Great father's day gift! Dave Ball"
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR! BUYERS BEWARE!,"The release of this CD appears to be an opportunity for cashing in on the unique and lasting popularity of Kyu's huge UK & US hit ""Sukiyaki"". His memory and talent do not deserve such an obvious rush to cash in on his lasting popularity. British mobile phone customers can download his hit to their phones, thus this rush out the door of this poor compilation of his long and popular work. Thirteen of the twenty songs on this compilation are in MONO! Though there are a few gems on this CD (albeit in MONO), if you're only looking for a good quality ""stereo"" rendition of ""Sukiyaki"", I suggest ""Hard to Find 45's on CD, Vol. 7: 60's Classics"". The producers of this series have done their homework and deliver exceptional quality recordings. EMI Music is a Capitol Music label and should have taken their time to produce a higher quality product. BEWARE!"
3,Question,"I don't know if we're supposed to do this, but I have questions. I'm more interested in the styles of the songs. How do the rest compare to ""Sukiyaki""? Are they mostly easy listening, pretty ballads? Rock and roll? A combination? Since he had only one international hit, they can't all be as good, but his voice was so strong, and the accompaniment so up-beat and fun on ""Sukiyaki,"" I wonder if I could fall in love with some of his others, whether they be stereo or mono. I gave it three stars because I couldn't give it five or one, without hearing it! I found a darling photo on the web (Japanorama) of him with his wife and children. What a tragedy, his plane crash! Put his grandchildren through college and buy the CD! : )"
4,Summary of Political and Social Aspects leading to the S.R.,"Interesting book, discusses the social evolution which produced the conditions for the Sexual Revolution and the political/legal battles which ended government/university oversight of individuals and their sexual choices. For anyone under 40 the book also opens a window into the relations between men and women before, and during the Sexual Revolution. Worth buying and reading, particularly if you are interested in understanding how the Sexual Revolution has impacted male/female relations today."
5,Wow! Read this book.,"Make Love, Not War is the first book I've read on sex in America that is both intelligent and titiliating. The chapters on group sex and swinging are too good to put down. Allyn did amazing interviews--he basically interviewed everyone who was involved in the sexual revolution. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in sex or American culture."
2,58mm Lens Hood,"Hood was difficult to install as it was easy to cross-thread it, given its plastic threads. Would not buy it again."
1,Vignettes on a Canon SX20,"With a Canon SX20, one has to zoom from an effective 28mm Wide Angle to an effective 35 mm Wide Angle not to have vignetting with any filter in place. Will still vignette with no filter at widest angle, but in that case one can use the supplied Canon Lens Hood."
3,FuelBelt Asthma Race Number Belt,"Bought this for the sole pupose of it holding my inhaler. Within 2 minutes of starting the race, my inhaler fell out of the holder. Thankfully, I had pockets and was able to put the inhaler in those. The area to hold the ""GU's"" was quite snug, again I used pockets in my shorts to hold the Gu. The clips for the race number was nice, since the bibs were biodegradable and many runners sweated their pinned on numbers off."
5,Awesome,"This album is really inspiring and spirit filled. The debut project of VaShawn Mitcell and the New Image Chorale is better than I expected. It is an album that I can listen to and be blessed over and over again. My favorite song was track #3 ""Feel Sometimes"" :) Check it out, I guarantee you will be blessed! I expect nothing but good things from this group for years to come!!"
3,It's okay,well this cd was tight when I heard it in 1997.. but now it doesn't really compete with the times of today....It sounds kinda out of date to me..cuz I bought it this year thinkin that it would still be tight..but I was wrong...It's just not good enough to last against the cd's of now..but the cd's isn't horrible though..it's okay..alright that's it.
1,Color as not as depicted,"I purchased these online because I wanted that particular color, but I just received the sheets and they are a gray, off-peach color that is not even close to the bright pink, as pictured in the photograph. However, the seller contacted me immediately when they saw the bad rating, and gave me the tracking number for the sheets with the correct color -- and would not allow me to pay for the second set, which was very generous of them. I insisted on paying for the second set, but they would not hear of it. GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE."
4,"A little thin yet strong, very soft.","These sheets are a nice pink, they mix and match well. I thought they were a smidgen thinner than most sheets I get, I buy 400TC+ normally. It doesn't seem to matter, though. It's not as though I can see my mattress cover through them. They seem plenty strong, and are snuggly soft. I would buy them again."
4,The Doctor at His Best,"This album has the songs I was looking for. I could say ""exactly what the Dr. ordered."" ""Walk on Gilded Splinters"" always does it for me. If you like the Dr. or recently became interested in VooDoo, this is the album."
5,Better than Being There!,A fantastic collection! It compliments the electric guitar I purchased with Dr. John's autograph and message on it!Get with it Dr. John fans! I can here you wheezing out there!
3,Not the best of compilation I would have made,"It's always going to be the case that when someone puts out a best of compilation of an artist you really dig, the opinion on which songs should have been included and not is always going to be a question. Where is 'Life', 'Traveling Mood', and 'Just the Same' all off his classic album - In The Right Place? What about 'Blow Wind Blow', 'Tipitina' or 'Somebody Changed The Lock' not to mention others from Gumbo? I don't think this compilation is compiled all that well, but what are you going to do, everyone has their favorites. Dr john is a legend. Buy Gumbo, In the Right Place, Gris Gris, and anything the man is releasing because he's still got it. So three stars although it hurts me to do so."
3,Les' Scosious,"Cut down from Rhino's 2CD anthology Mos' Scosious from the previous year, this 18-track non-chronological collection manages to weave its way through the various styles of Dr John's albums in such a way that they seem to fit together despite their disparate nature, from the mystic voodoo of the Gris Gris album and the New Orleans roots of his piano playing to the lushness of the two tracks from In A Sentimental Mood. Most of the most popular singles are included (missing are Wang Dang Doodle, Let The Good Times Roll, Rite Away, Let's Make A Better World and a few others), as well as some illuminating album tracks made for Atco (to 1974), for Warner (1989-1992), including the Grammy-winning duet with Rickie Lee Jones, Makin' Whoopee; and the Baltimore-based Clean Cuts (a solo piano tour-de-force found on Joe Liggins' Honey Dripper)(1981)"
1,A wasted opportunity...,"This book always makes me kind of sick. It has great pictures and a lavish presentation, but the text is a Swiss cheese of major and minor errors that should have been easily corrected in the years since he first declaimed them in his cartoon book years ago. We've seen all the pictures before. Lee Raskin's book James Dean at Speed has the pictures and nice research and writing."
1,"Massive waste, massive disappointment","Monster is typically a great, very reliable brand. Honestly, I don't know what happened here. Got these in the mail, opened up the package and my first impression was ""These look well made- they'll probably work great!"" Boy was I wrong. They split the sound in the worst way possible. Sound quality was low, muffled, and terrible. Unplugged one cable and it improved. Removed the adapters entirely and my sound was back to normal. Thought this would be a real convenience because my subwoofer only has one RCA output and I have to constantly unplug things and plug in other things to use my surround sound on different devices. As it turns out, these were a massive waste of money and a massive disappointment. Luckily, the new TV I got a few months later reroutes the sound for me and eliminates the need for ripoff adapters like these."
4,Bunce and Mee do all right by Me!,"This is a fantastic coffee table book for those interested in showing off there love of the sweet science. The photos are stunning and Bunce and Mee show proper respect to Pernell Whitaker as well as some of the other great fighters often over shadowed by Ali. While the book is predictable in glorifying Ali, it does take the time to track the history of lighter weights."
1,"Poor on Functionality, Okay on Looks.","I purchased one of these rear window guards for my 2000 Yukon (new body style) with cargo doors. I was not expecting it to totally keep the rear windows clean, but I hoped it would at least provide an improvement to keeping some dirt/dust/snow/road salt off the windows. After having this now for over (6)-months through summer, fall, and now winter I can say it provides NO IMPROVEMENT whatsoever. My rear windows collect just as much crud as they did without the deflector.It does looks good on the vehicle and blends in nicely with the vehicle lines (it is not a ""bolt-on, after-thought"" look).The hardware supplied with the EGR deflectors is chincy/cheap."
2,Very thin book,"Bottom line: there's not much to this book. Unless you're a horse race player, which I am not, there is very little useful information. Brokopp provides a few online casino URL's and some background information on the casinos, but there is really nothing in the book that couldn't be found easily on the Web (for nothing). Save your money and skip this book."
5,The best intro book to internet gambling,"I have read a number of books on this topic, and Brokopp's is by far the best. I learned more and I learned it quicker than with anything else. I didn't buy the book looking for ""secrets"" to win. I wanted to know what internet gambling is all about and this book told me in concise, easy-reading form. Also, I'm a horse racing fan and the section on horse racing and the new ways to handicap and wager was very enlightening This book is not a gimmick. It's the real thing. No promises, just knowledge and advice. I'd recommend it to anyone."
5,Must-have book before you gamble on internet,"There's no sure-fire way to beat internet gambling. All you can do is be prepared for what's out there and the traps to avoid. This book has it all. It'll get you started in a safe and informed manner. No cumbersome detail or nonsense about ""tricks"" that don't exist. Also, no boloney about beating the sites out of bonus cash. Brokopp lets you know there's a price to be paid for everything. If you're willing to devote hours of time to get $... bucks here or there, that's your business. This book is not about that. It's a common sense, get-started approach that's a quick and easy read. Also, the section on horse racing is outstanding. I look at that part of the book as an unexpected bonus."
2,There is better books out there,This book doesnt really cover much ground as far as internet gambling is concerned. A paragraph writeup on each of the 6 major gambling software providers and a brushup on the rules of the games. Thats for the casino part. The horse racing section gives a rundown on the different horse racing sites and some handicapping info. All in all I would rate this book 2 stars. The information is too general to be of much use.
3,Value for money,"The delivery was on time. Once the appropriate driver was downloaded from the Creative Lab website, the installation was simple. Picture quality is satisfactory (not excellent), but value for money."
4,XP Home vs XP Pro,"The problems that andyfano stated were ONLY for Windows XP *PRO.* He said it worked for Windows XP Home. So, could future reviewers please specify if it's Home or Pro? It is NOT the same thing.As for my own, I found the picture clear and could make it work fairly well in low light settings. Could be smoother, but it's all I need for video messaging. Install was fine on an XP Home computer, but I would be interested to know if anyone else has problems on Pro as another member of my family with Pro is looking to get one.All in all, cost vs. benefit is great."
2,"OK if it works, very frustrating when it doesn't.","I bought two of these to do video conferencing with my parents. I installed it on my parents machine running Windows XP Home and everything worked fine. I then tried to install it on my home machine running XP Pro and it failed to recognize the camera. I tried on a laptop running XP Pro and it failed as well. I contacted Creative both by phone and email. They tried to helpful, but in the end nothing worked.I spent many hours trying re-installs in safe mode, adjusting the bios, removing unrecognized USB devices from the device manager, clearing INF files, and nothing worked. Even the recommended install asks that you ignore the warnings that the drivers are not approved by Microsoft. If you're running XP it warns that you not be connected to the internet when you install the updated drivers from the site. Very clumsy.Finally I gave up, bought a Logitech QuickCam Messenger and was up and going in under 10 minutes."
5,one great little camera for computer scaredy cats,For the low price I just knew I would get a pitiful little camera but I was wrong. I installed it on my HP 510 with Windows XP and had no trouble at all.The very first picture was just as clear as it could be.It's a nice little camera and I'm pleased with it.
2,Decent initial buy...,"Box suckered me in... (1024x768 images, 640x480 video, etc)...Dunno if it's age now or what (1yr old?), but the quality sucks and it seems to be getting worse! Always did poor in low light, now it's really grainy and the colors are faded. I suggest staying away and, if you want a budget buy, the Logitech QuickCam is better."
4,WebCam Pro,"Installation on XP was problematic. Instructions are very poor. Eventually got software to ""see"" the camera (had to manually load a dll!). I unisntalled drivers, then went with the XP set up. It worked. Pictures/video a good for the price. I'm still experimenting with the best compression technique to minmize file size, while maximizing video quality.Pretty good, other than the software installation."
5,"Read the comic, then read this exceptional novelization","The best novelization of a comic I've ever read, hands down. In fact, this is better than any novelization of a film I've ever read, either. From Elliot S! Maggin comes an adaptation that matches the iconic, mythic feel and grandeur of the original story. He adds such rich detail and additional story that I tend to tell people that it's not enough to just read the comic anymore, that a full appreciation for and understanding of the story requires also reading this novelization. I give it an enthusiastic recommendation, and my copy (this isn't an easy book to find, ya know) was well priced and came fairly swiftly, and even the paper jacket over the hardcover was in good condition. Recommendations all around!"
4,The Boys are back in town!,"I grew up reading comics and it always seemed they were timeless, that the heroes never got old or seriously hurt but this book tells the story of what happened to some of those great DC comic book heroes like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and the Flash as time went by and the next generation of heroes to come. I enjoyed reading this book it was easy reading, had a lot of action, and bought me back to a time when comic book reading was part of life. I would like to see more books like this where DC comic book heroes are brought to life in books like Marvel comics have been lately."
5,From a review by Andrew Smith in the Commercial Appeal 4-12,"But the Captain read the book, and his wrath was appeased. For it was authored by Elliot S. Maggin, who labored in the vineyards at DC for 15 years as its chief Superman scribe, and knows these characters as a farmer knows his sheep.And the Captain did turn to the fans, and did grin, saying, ""Take ye this book and read it. And come not back to me and complain, or I shall smite thee by continuing to write in this annoying style."
2,The audiobook wasn't what I had hoped for.,"Here, I have read the comic book (TPB) and I've read the novel, so I'm thinking that the audiobook was going to be just as good, if not greater. I was wrong. The fact that this is done by a full cast doesn't take away from the fact that the acting was very poor. For the first three sides (four in all) the acting by the main characters is casual; the anger is casual, the happiness is casual...EVERYTHING is casual! It's as if the people who had done the voices had done audiobooks for decades, and therefore expect you to get the full emotion from what little they drip out or they're just not putting their best effort into it. Either way, it was a disappointment for me; the only reason why I'll ever listen to it again is that the audiobook gives you new information that you can't find in the comic book or the novel, and that's why I gave this thing a rating at all."
3,DC again proves unworthy of its writers,"This book was decent and nothing else, not that I intended to order a novel based on a comic. I assumed that the hardcover edition refered to a hardcover comic book, though this was not the place. So I ended up with a book by Elliot S. Magin, its not terrible. The writing is interesting though does little to capture the grandure and splendor of the Kingdom Come comic book. DC knocked a novel spin-off, another comic book spin-off (with atrocious art) from one of the greatest graphic novels that I have ever read. merely proving again that the DC title does not deserve the writers and wonderful artists that they have. I would suggest the Kingdom Come graphic novel not the book or other comic, Mark Waid is a genious. Also the 'original prints' contaiuned only in this book are merely plays on prexisting prints, though the Spectre print is neat the six or seven prints are nothign to get excited about."
4,Prose paperback review...,"This is a very well done adaptation by Elliot S. Maggin of the amazing comic story, one that got me back into comics, briefly. It expands on the minor events in the comic and does an excellent job of fleshing out the main character, Norman McCay. The only problem I have with it is that it's not accessible to everyone. If you haven't read the comic or aren't familiar with the heroes and villains of the DC Universe, you'll probably miss the historical details that made the original series so much fun. Comic characters were designed to be seen, and I feel that they never translate well into prose. Read it as a supplement to the comic, and you'll be okay."
2,BEWARE which edition you buy!,"I ordered this thinking it was the hardback edition of the graphic novel, when in fact it is the novelization of the graphic novel. There is a hardback edition of the graphic novel, but it has a different ISBN. Be sure to check before you order!"
3,rust !!!,"great stain remover, but after some using tiny pieces of steel wool get on surfaces and especially if wet create tiny stains of rust everywhere..."
3,Another Tess Gem,The early Tess books are so solid. Every one of them is full of great character development (you can tell that Lippman in many ways is really living what Tess is experiencing) and great suspense. This is a terrific read.
4,Lots of Twists in this Nice Mystery,"Former newspaper reporter turned private investigator Tess Monoghan meets her friend Feeney, a reporter for the Beacon-Light, for a drink. She finds him drunk, because his editors pulled his story, an investigative piece into the scandalous background local businessman ""Wink"" Wynkowski, who is trying to bring professional basketball to Baltimore, just before its scheduled publication. However someone hacks into the newspaper's computer and the story runs anyway. Then Wynkowski winds up dead in his garage with his motor running. Was it suicide?The Beacon-Light hires Tess to discover who hacked into their computer. As Tess begins to dig, she discovers a dark side to the story and now her life may be in danger.There are lots of twists and red herrings in this story that delivers enough description about Baltimore to almost be considered a travelogue. A nice mystery."
4,A good follow up!,"This is a very good sequel to Baltimore Blues. Although the mystery itself isn't the best I've read, the characters are very intriguing and the writing is excellent. This is a particularly good series for late 20s/early 30s people who are ""wondering what to do when they grow up"". Nice job!"
5,Great writer,You do not need to like mysteries to love Laura Lippmann's wonderful books. The characters are well-drawn. The writing is wonderful with great hilarious one-liners thrown in when you least expect it. The plots move quickly towards their unexpected denouement!
5,Read this book! It is great.,"Laura Lippman's two new mysteries are great. I live in Baltimore, and she really captures the city. Her mysteries are clever, the characters interesting, and there is humor too, not to mention a bit of romance. Write faster, Laura - I read the first two in four days!!!"
1,Heroine's stupidity is overwhelming; don't read this drivel,"Tess is a complete idiot about Crow and it really made me MAD!!! I liked the stuff about Esskay and the mystery, but the stuff with Crow seriously peeved me off--it lost a star for that. It was also kind of predictable, and Tess' relationship with Whitney is totally flawed. The heroine screws up her life and has no one to blame but herself. This one certainly didn't 'charm' me; I won't be going on any more adventures with Tess Monaghan."
2,Warning! Not a New Book!,"This book newly released in hardcover appeared to me to be a new Tess mystery, but to my disappointment it is just a hardcover version of this book released as a paperback in 1997. Thinking it was a new story, I was looking forward to continuing the series featuring Tess and Crow, but I soon realized that Tess was still 29 and Crow 23 and that maybe I had even read the 1997 book. I'm not sure as I put the book down after realizing it was not new.Overall, I have enjoyed the Lippman books that I have read although only a couple of them were page turners. I wish I had paid more attention to the details of this book before buying it and then hopefully would have realized it was first released in 1997.So these comments are just a warning to other readers who might make the same mistake I did."
2,Useless.,"Death and Rebirth, as a package, is an utter waste of money. Granted, the animation is nice, and it makes for some good eye candy, but the content is completely pointless. The first episode (Death) is nothing but a clip reel recapping the first 24 episodes of the series. The second (Rebirth) appears at first to be original content, but it's nothing more than the first half-hour or so of the End of Evangelion. The only content here you won't be finding more completely in either the series or End of Eva is the original song that plays at the end of Rebirth... Just buy End of Eva: you'll get all the original content on this disc, without the cliffhanger."
2,A frustrating...,"Atter watching the re-caps of old episodes, you get treated to a good half hour episode. But please. I can think of better ways to spend my [money] for 30 minutes of ""fun"".And to add insult to injury for all the hard-core fans (who obviously are the ones buying this DVD) they have added new speech to the re-cap section... Which in my opinion is like re-writing the bible so that the ""simple"" folk can understand it."
2,Please do not buy this!!!,"Don't get me wrong, I love the series...but if you just buy The End of Evangelion, that dvd starts where this one does but finishes through to the end...making this DVD a redundant purchase if you just want the full story. Buy it if you really have to own the full collection...wish someone told me this before I bought it."
1,Useless and containing nothing new,"Everything in the first half of this movie can be found in the series, and everything in the second half can be found in the movie. Maybe 2% of the footage in here is from the Director's Cut episodes, but that tiny amount of footage (which isn't even new, just unreleased in the US) just isn't worth the cost of buying this DVD. If you buy the Perfect Collection and End of Evangelion, then there is no reason whatsoever to get this disc.If you're really that desperate for Director's Cut footage, buy the Japanese DVDs. Then you get ALL of the Director's Cut footage, not just 30 seconds of it."
1,"Great Series, Pointless Movie","Highly recommend watching the following:1. Neon Genesis the perfect collection (Episodes 1-24)2. Then watch Neon Genesis Evangelion - The End of EvangelionThere is no point watching Episodes 25 and 26 or Death and Rebirth for the following reasons:EPISODE 25 -- Crude images, Philosophical, no connection to series.EPISODE 26 -- Nothing but random scenes from previous episodes.DEATH -- Nothing but random scenes from previous episodes.REBIRTH -- This is the first part of End of Evangelion, thus no point watching it.I do NOT know what happened, but my theory is that they ran out of time or money at the end of the series and needed to release something. End of Evangelion is what episodes 25 and 26 should have been."
4,Continuation of neongenesis - Evangelion,"It continues the story, but makes it very difficult to understand what is going on. It has no clearcut answer to all the loose ends from the ordinary series."
3,More like the Best of Evangellion,"This was released as the first ending to the series but all this DVD is the best of Neon Genesis. Basically they cram the entire series into an 90-120 minute DVD. There is no true ending aside from what came from the series. This is mostly for Fans of the series and actually should of been included in the box set. On the good side of things this would be a good idea to view before the DVD ""End of Evangellion"" which for all extensive purposes will make that one more entertaining without having to purchase the series in it's entirty. Overall this is only OK, just the best of nothing more."
2,A waste,"Death and Rebirth is a complete waste. It contains a recap of the series and the first part of End of Evangelion. The only reason you would even consider renting (but certainly not buying) Death and Rebirth is if you are a fan of the series but have not seen it for some time and want to watch End of Evangelion. Even so, you can always refresh your memory by visitng various Evangelion fansites on the internet. There's no need to waste money.If you haven't watched the series, watch the series. If you've just watched the series, rent (or buy) End of Evangelion. If you haven't watched it a long time, read a summary on the net and then rent End of Evangelion.Death and Rebirth will be a dissapointment for majority of even the most hardcore fans out there. You might want it for the sake of adding it to your collection, but there's no reason to watch it...there is no original footage at all..."
3,2nd disc does not upconvert!,"Be warned, the second disc in the 2 disc DVD set ""The End of Evangelion"" does not upconvert for 16x9 TVs. The commentary track on the flip side (yes, it's a 2 sided disc) of the first disc ""Death & Rebirth "" is hysterical, tho - a must hear for every EVA and Amanda fan."
2,Big disappionment.,"...Shame really because I enjoyed the TV series (apart from the last 2 episodes). It seems to be snippets joined together in a random order, flashbacks all over the place and subtitles that are more like subliminal messages. At least Rebirth gives us some hope that the next part should be better.I gave it two stars, one for the music and the other beause it is Neon Genesis. Fly Me to The Moon is conspicuous by its absence but the rest of the score is quite good."
2,well....,"I agree this was a rip off! I rented this movie and after 3 minutes or less I turned it off. Why shoulden't you see this? well, for a whole 60 minutes they show nothing but flashbacks of old episodes! They call this a movie? Though, I think unless your a die hard eva fan skip to rebirth cause thats where it truely begins. But still This is a complete rip off. I think you should just skip to the end of evangelion the ""REAL"" full lengh movie!"
1,only if your a hardcore evangelion fan,"This was a real let down for me. When i saw on the box that it was almost 2 hours long i was realy happy, i was expecting it to be a movie, but insted it tournd out to be nothing but a cheesy colash of jumbled flashbacks from the series, only about 25 to 30 minuts is original, and the extras were pretty {terrible} i would only suggest this only for hardcore evangelion fans like me who wernt happy with the confusing and meeningless ending of the originalseries."

2,Buyers No No!!,This is just recycled evangelion footage from all the previous episodes I never saw the vhs that came after this but it was cause I was disappointed I bought this movie brand new at the video store cause everyone made a big deal out of it just too see what I have already seen. Over rated I sold VHS copy for a $1.99 and I only watched it once and bought it new for 15.99 two years ago for shame. Only reason I gave this a two stars is that old footage was kinda nice to see again and was kinda crazy.
1,"Bad, i've seen better","Lets get things started eh? If you haven't seen the series, GET IT. It is a epic journey through a biblical time. If you are too poor or you don't want to waste your money, but still want to see the series, get it. Basically it is a pointless journey that hits all the highlights of the series. Rebirth is just the first 30 minutes of the End, so just get that IS YOU HAVE THE SERIES."
2,Why did I buy this?,"This is exactly what all the other reviews say it is. The ""Death"" portion is about a 60 minute recap of the Evangelion series, and the ""Rebirth"" portion is about the first 25 minutes of ""End of Evangelion""*. So why did I buy it anyway? BecauseNeon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelionis currently selling for about $40 and I was too cheap to buy it.*Obviously, since I don't own ""End of Evangelion"" I don't know this personally.[Edit: I found a copy of ""End of Evangelion"" in a used DVD store. Hoo man. Pardon me while I try to put my brain back together.]I enthusiastically recommend you buyEvangelion: 1.11 You Are Not Alone [Blu-ray] andEvangelion: 2.22 You Can [Not] Advance, and then we'll all have to wait for 3.33 and 4.44."
2,Disappointing end to a good series,"I enjoyed the Evangelion series, but was sorely disappointed by the ending. Not only is it disjointed and largely incomprehensible, but it is a profound anticlimax, the series deserves better. As the plot becomes less involved in external events (which rapidly begin to leave behind the strictures of even the most basic logic anyway) and more in the minds of the characters (always my lease favorite part of the series) we are forced to deal with more of the least attractive parts of the series, Shinji's whiny self-absorption, Rei's withdrawl from reality, and Asuka's bipolar depression and rage. If you liked the series up to this point, stop before watching this ""ending"" - whatever you may imagine as the end has to be better than what they came out with."
4,Warning For The New Fans,This DVD is good if your a fan and have seen the entire series but if your in the middle of the series do not buy this at all or attempt to watch this because it will basically ruin the entire series for you. In a lot of video stores you'll see the first few volumes of Evangelion and then most likely you'll see this DVD next to them and anybody that hasn't seen the series or knows the DVD volumes will pick this up thinking it's apart of the series and it's not. It will show you a little bit of every episode because it's a recap for the series and the movie. It's a very well put together DVD for fans that have seen it but for those of you just getting into Evangelion stay away from this until you've seen the full series. If you've seen the series then this is a nice DVD to pick up but I would wait for a lower price or get it at a discount store because it's not a something you would terribly need.
2,Warning: not optimized for 16x9!!!!!!!!!,"I've had this set for a few years - so before the 16x9 came along it never bothered me -but beware - there are new ones coming, so DON'T BUY THIS - they're not optimized for 16x9, and the transfer is quite poor.I hope they'll come out with Blu Ray versions along with the new movies."
4,"Good, but a teaser","I got a copy of this DVD out of Singapore about a year ago. So it is the sub-titled version. I hope that the US released one is dubbed because it is too hard to follow other wise. The first three fourths of the movie is just a recap of the entire series. I noticed two or three additional scenes slipped in there. Its the end ""Rebirth"" that is great, but it just ends. If you are really into Evangelion, you'll be more than into it, but you'll also feel cheated when it just ends on just a cliff-hanger, but then you only have to wait a month for the rest."
3,A bit bland really,"I really wanted to like these since I try to support smaller companies as much as possible. They are ok if you eat them by the handful, other wise the cheese flavoring just doesn't come through. Personally I like them, they just need more cheese flavoring. I gave one of the bags in my case to a friend of mine who has been dieting and sticking to less processed and chemical laden foods. I figured that maybe my taste buds were a bit out of whack since I often eat foods that are strongly flavored, but she confirmed my own impressions above. Her kids didn't like them either. That really surprised me because usually they really go for junk food like this."
1,Prefer Cheetos,I prefer the Cheetos brand. These do not have as much tangy cheese flavor as Cheetos and don't have as much of the good corn meal taste and texture. I have 11 1/2 bags left and went to the local store to buy more Cheetos.
4,Rising Booty,My girlfriend loves the Pirates booty but the ever rising price might cause us to sink the booty ship. Time will tell.
5,Love this stuff...,"I originally bought this on a whim after reading several positive reviews about it (that, and it was on sale). This stuff is wonderful. My kids actually prefer Pirate's Booty to Cheetos (""can we please have the healthy Cheetos instead?"")--coming from my kids, that's saying something.It's a much better alternative to Cheetos (and cheaper as well). I love this stuff! And if you're trying to count calories, two big handfuls of this (which equals 1 serving) go a lot further than a serving of Doritos or an equivalent. I've actually given bags of this to friends/ family, and they always want to know where I bought it from! Great snack!"
5,Addicted to these !,I love this snack. I am addicted to it and crave it all the time. I will definitely order it again.
5,I'm a convert...no more Cheetos for me!,"I tried these on a whim after hearing about Veggie Booty for a long time. I knew I wasn't ready for VB, but I could certainly try out a new kind of cheese puff. I previously thought that a day without Cheetos was a day wasted, so this was a big change.These are the best things ever! They taste like real cheese and there's some variation in the intensity of the flavor - every single one doesn't taste exactly the same. They aren't as crunchy as Cheetos and don't turn your fingers orange!After trying a couple bags purchased at the grocery store, I decided I loved them enough to invest in this 12-pack from Amazon. Okay, so maybe I went a little wild and had a bag (or two) a day until they were gone - don't judge me!Try these out! Buy a bag at the grocery store and then get the 12-pack. You'll be very happy that you did!"
5,WARNING: This Comes In A HUGE Box,"I was both horrified and delighted when this huge 2 x 1.5 x 1 feet box from Amazon came to the office for me. No wonder ordering it with Amazon Prime 2-day shipping still took 3 days (plus the weekend...)So be warned, all, for $20 (or $15, or whatever the current price is), you will be getting a HUGE box, and if you ship it to work, your coworkers will all wonder what it is and you'll be forced to tell them, and then guilted into giving up a few bags to sate the hungry, curious masses!Less Pirate Booty for you!!!!!!!"
5,Great Snack Anytime!,This is a great snack anytime of the day. The whole family loves it. No kernels makes it a winner and the white cheddar taste is great. It's so light it's easy to polish off a bag in no time though!
5,Pirates Booty Rules!!!,Pirates Booty tastes very good. It is kind of healthy for you because they make the booty out of rice. They pop the rice so thier puffy and crunchy and then add white chedder. Pirates booty is a good snack to eat and comes in different sized packages. It's awesome!!!
2,mild cheese flavored styrofoam packing peanuts.....,"THIS SNACK IS ""OK""...2 OR 3 STARS... FIRST, THESE ARE INDEED JUNK FOOD...ONE THIRD CALORIES FROM FAT, HIGH GLYCEMIC CARBS, 1 GRAM FIBER, 2 GRAMS PROTEIN. SECOND, THE CHEESE FLAVOR IS MILDER THAN THE ""AGED WHITE CHEDDAR"" LED ME TO BELIEVE. THE TEXTURE WAS THAT OF VERY SOFT STYROFOAM PACKING PEANUTS. SORRY, BUT IT'S TRUE! IF SOMEONE OFFERED ME SOME AT THE MOVIES OR NEXT TO A SANDWICH...OK, SURE...BUT THE GUSHING PRAISE I READ HERE LED ME TO PURCHASE A 12 BAG CASE WHILE THEY WERE ON SALE...I WILL BE SHARING THESE FREELY...NO TEMPTATION TO HOARD THEM. THEY'RE JUST ""OK"" ...IF I COULD GIVE A BAG TO THE BIG FANS, IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE."
4,A bit pricey but worth it,"Pirate booty is a little pricier than other side-items I get to make lunches with, however it is all-natural. This is huge for me, that and my child NEVER gets tired of it. So, I don't have to keep trying different things out. The pack of 12 4-ounce bags gives the best value. Since the product is mostly air an ounce looks like an awful lot, but it'll be finished in no time!"
4,Quality PUFFcorn,"I ordered this product assuming that I'd be receiving white cheddar popcorn. However, what I received was white cheddar puffcorn. Disappointing at first, but I couldn't resist. It came in a nice ""pirate's chest"" (opposed to boring packaging) and the quality and smell of the snack was awesome. This stuff is pretty good, but be noted that you're not getting popcorn!"
3,needs more secure packaging,"While the product was good, three of the twelve bags arrived opened and spoiled. They need to improve the quality of shipping this product before I would order any more of it."
1,Disappointed in quality,"I was recommended to try the Pirates Booty, so I decided to order it online as I can not get it in any local stores. When I received my shipment it seemed fine but as I was removing the bags from the box I realized that the bags were not sealed and the Pirates Booty was going all over the place. Basically I paid for something I could not even eat with not refund.Very dissatifed."
4,Handy for beginner homeopaths!,"I have been seeing a professional homeopath, but he's not always available. This book allows me to prescribe for minor illness that my kids are experiencing at onset, sometimes nipping it in the bud. It has also given me insight into the homeopathic process and has greatly enhanced my communication with my homeopath. It is organised logically and written in plain english. A great starting point for those interested in homeopathy. There is also a matching remedy kit available from Miranda Castro which would be handy."
1,Not Impressed,"Very first homeopathy book ever and this was not a good way to start. I hate the book, it is confusing and I don't like the organization. It made me want to just throw it away and give up on my quest to learn more about homeopathic medicine for my family."
4,if you only purchase one homeopathy manual... choose this.,"as an avid student and patient of homeopathy [18 years and counting] this is still my favorite lay manual of homeopathy. ms. castro provides clear physical, mental and emotional descriptions corresponding with each remedy in a tone and language which is both in-depth and intellegent. you will benefit from her insight into the origin of each remedy as well as the remedy's symptoms/""picture."" my well-loved copy is literally falling apart."
3,Very Basic,"This is a nice book for anyone trying to figure out how to use the most popular health-food-store homeopathic remedies. Its classical approach recommends only one remedy at a time (as opposed to the readily available ""combo"" remedies), and as such is a good, simple starting point."
4,Great Book!,I've been using Homeopathy for my family for 15 years and this is the book I use the most.It was recommended by two of my homeopathic physicians. The Repertory could be expanded a little more...
2,Weak at the shovel/handle area,"This shovel doesn't have a lot of structural strength. If you try to lift icy snow, it bends a lot. My shovel is now flat, not a scoop as it bent severly in one day of shoveling. I wouldn't recommend it for anything except light, freshly fallen new snow."
1,disapointed,"This shovel turned out to be very weak.After dealing with the most hideous wrapping job I have ever seen,I put it to use .The corners of the shovel rolled back the very first time I hit the concrete curb.The plastic handle flexes every time a load of snow was lifted. The ""D"" handle is too small to be used while wearing gloves.All in all I am sure you can do better."
5,A Jewish fan of Underdog,"I recall as a child watching every episode of Underdog.my favorite episodes were the one's with Simon Barsinister and Riff Raff.also, as a Jewish person I see nothing anti-Semitic or racist in any of the Underdog episodes.the politically correct person who referred to Underdog as ""racist/anti-semitic"" is obviously the type of individual that probably sees everything as racist in society.in my humble opinion, Underdog was nothing more then a very entertaining cartoon for kids that was basically a spoof of superman with Sweet Polly Purebred representing Lois Lane."
5,A Whole Lotta Fun!,"This first Underdog DVD is right on time, arriving during my birthday month. I had not seen an episode in many years, yet I would sometimes find myself singing that catchy Underdog theme song. I happened across the only copy in a music store and believe me I snapped that sucker right up!I am quite pleased with the pristine video and sound quality. Featuring a well designed menu, the disc is also loaded with extras.While the cartoon material is aimed primarily at youngsters, I found plenty of reasons to crack up with laughter. It made me feel like a kid again as I remembered that this was one of my favorite 'toons.You can choose to get bent out of shape fussing over some rather miniscule details as one reviewer did. But why ruin your own day when you can choose to simply enjoy what you get, and this DVD delivers plenty. I hope they release more episodes soon!"
4,Its good to bring back memories of youth,"I thought that the disc was great, considering that Cartoon Network rarely shows this anymore. It is somewhat incomplete with title cards missing, but it is still good fun. Not anywhere near racist or anti-semitic as cat-in-a-former-life said in her poor excuse for a review. She clearly has deep issues that need resolving. Its Underdog, not Fritz the Cat or South Park. She needs to remember waaaaay back to her own youth and not be so uptight."
2,A Great Cartoon Butchered by Classic Media,"Did I miss something that the other reviewers saw? Or did I get a defective DVD set? This set would have been alot better if Classic Media kept Underdog as the original TV series. Each Underdog episode was initially shown as a serial with cliff-hangers. In between each cliffhanger was a short like Tennesse Tuxedo. What Classic Media did was to run each episode in one complete uninterrupted showing. This takes away from the original series' charm. The ""Cliffhanger episodes"" are banished into the features section which is a shame because the cliffhangers are classics in and among themselves. The features would have been better if they interviewed some of the actors such as Don Adams or even some of the people involved with the production such as Howard Stern's father, Ben. Instead you get co-creator Joe Harris' creepy account of a never before seen Underdog episode written for two girls."
1,Order at your own risk,"I ordered this on November 4, 2006. I'm still waiting for it. I just got another email from Amazon saying it's going to be yet another 4 to 6 weeks."
2,"The ""new"" book that wasn't","The book's information is good -- I knew it would be.But, I paid for a New book. What I got was a Used bookfull of someone else's pencil marks. Did you think I wouldn'tnotice all those pencil marks? Or, did you think I wouldforget that I had paid the New price?Nice job wringing a little extra money out of me."
4,good book,It is one of the books I love. It is easy to read and provide a good background about parallel programs' design.
4,A lively look into Anderson's Celtic roots,"This CD is a great exploration into Anderson's Celtic roots. While it isn't as strong lyrically as some of his earlier material, he makes up for it with his great voice and the loose band he has put together."
2,Not so good from a great one!,"This cd is average at best. The problem with Jon sometimes is he has too much on his plate, which is rather evident on this release. Jon has never shyed away from taking songs from his previous releases and giving them new titles and slightly new arrangements, which is fine if the results are at least as good as the original, but these songs are half finished ideas that need more time to evolve. The clone song is ""boundaries"" from ""Animation"" and the version on this cd falls well short of the original. Also, the sound quality of this release is below average.If Jon could spend more time on each of his solo outings and put out half as many in that amount of time he would have even more fans.Remember his 70's and 80's releases. More time, better music. Stick to Olias of Sunhillow, Song of Seven and Animation. This cd is for completist only."
1,Hold on a minute...........,"I love Irish music. All music has its place. Jon Anderson is a weird and wonderful human being and we delight at his various musical projects. This however just sounds embarrasing. We know Jon is all 'New Age' now and all that and he always has been but this recording just seems to be too silly. I can't seem to work out whether the live pub thing is suppose to be a genuinely good vibe or what? At the end of the day you've got raw irish music in the background and Jon singing his flowery, esoteric lyrics over the top of it! Maybe I'm missing the point. it just sounds SO SILLY...........sorry. (I do love YES)"
2,"I love Jon, but...","I guess the two main things that bug me about this album are the use of traditional Celtic tunes without any credit (what's up with that??) and the seemingly forced production of a relatively uninspired album. Don't get me wrong, I'm ordinarily a huge fan, but this came out in the middle of that flurry of Jon albums in the mid 1990s, and you can really tell it's rushed. He put this one out shortly after moving to San Luis Obispo, and the ""pub"" is one I've been to. The accoustics aren't terrific let me tell you, so why he decided to do this album there is beyond me when he has his own studio space within a few miles. It just doesn't work. It seems like he's scrambling for material, and it shows. I own it just to complete my collection, but don't really listen to it."
4,Don't be so harsh !,The fact that it is a live recording is what sells it !I love it...and would highly give it 2 thumbs up.I think it is a very clear beautiful recording.
5,A real down to earth and professional video about healing,"I have been a Christian for many years and so far have never before seen a video which can be said to portray the effect of a spirit led healing service anywhere as well as this one does. In this video we see real people and what happens to them as they have their first opportunity to meet a loving and forgiving God. The music is real, the action is real, and the results are real."
2,Great idea but it didn't work.,"I was so excited about these books and first of all I must say they are absolutely beautiful. However, that being said it is really hard for me to find the items in the pictures (art) they want you to count. I can't imagine how frustrating that would be for a child."
3,Definately Enjoying this...,"I was almost turned away when I read the first review, but after reading the second one, I decided to go for it. When I first got it, I admit it did sound fuzzy, distorted. But I changed the EAX setting on my Jukebox from the Custom EQ setting I like for my headphones, to the Environment/Auditorium setting and it sounds great. I have over 2000 songs in my Nomad Jukebox 3, and it's like having my entire CD catalog in my car. I guess it helps to play with these things before you go running for the Return slip."
5,Perfect,"I received the base today (2 day delivery) from Amazon. I wanted it before the new scroll saw arrived. I read all the reviews, and figured that there might be some problems. None were encountered. Went together in about 45 min. I read John Toews review and agree with most of it. The instructions can be a bit confusing, but read through them because they are generic and not specific for the HRS 2158. Followed them from Standard Duty instructions, then T style, then the ""Floor Lock"" installation. It is to just keep the mobile wheel from moving when the front wheels are locked in place. It should be adjusted to just touch the floor, not lift the base frame. I placed it near the apex of the frame near the mobile wheel. This will be great in that all my machines are on wheels due to space limitations. It will make it easier to move to a working location, and not drag it as I did my old Dremal."
3,It's Okay For What It's Worth,"I like most of these songs but I wouldn't want to listen to them all the time. The only song I really like on here is ""The Choice Is Yours"" by Black Sheep. The rest of the songs are alright- it's not like they were jams back in the day. I've heard better dance rap music. Hollaaaa!"
2,"Good card, bad driver","This is actually a pretty good card with a really bad driver. As long as you use the Asus WL-138g driver as others have mentioned you should be fine. I would have given it 4 stars if it came with the Asus driver to begin with. Before you install this driver, I suggest you pull out the card, shut off your computer, then put it back in again. Then boot up your computer and install the driver. I got excellent test results with the Asus driver (measured with the Road Runner speed test)."
1,Very Poor and Slow Connection,"I dont have the connection problem most have experienced, ie, my connection disconnecting very often. Mine stays up, BUT, only connects at an impressive 1.0 Mbps. I have tried everything, removing everything, keeping my connection free,... NO use. My other PC's around the house, All WIRELESS, connect at 54.0 Mbps. But I have used other brands. I bought this for the price, and boy do I feel stupid. D-Link, Im glad I spent a little money now to know not to spend more on anything that bears your name. What a shame."
1,Junk,"This card could not hold a connection more than 5 minutes and then I had to battle to get it to reconnect. I am 5 feet from my wireless router that works fine with other wireless device. It also freezed my machine sometimes. After two calls to techsupport, the recommended that I return the unit, which is what I will do.Don't waste your time."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"This product is horrible. It took three calls to tech support to get it ""working"". It drops the connection all the time even when the signal is very strong. I am using a D-Link DI-624 router. I will be removing this card and returning it today."
1,Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!,"Please save yourself a lot of wasted time. Go with a different brand. This card is very bad. It randomly rebooted my machine while I am surfing the internet. I reinstalled my old 802.11b card, no more unwanted reboot."
3,"D-Link DWL-G510 Wireless PCI Adapter, 802.11g, 54 Mbps",I have very low signal or low at all times...It does work though .... My laptop does great on it where ever in my house/
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"I have just attempted to install this device and failed. I've called customer support and discovered the problem is with the driver they provided in package. Tech support told me to download an updated driver online...but I can't because the ""page cannot be displayed"" to the download. It's one dead-end after another. Please don't waste YOUR time."
4,Works great but installation was below par,"Once installed and configured the card works great with no drops. But, installation was awful--it kept looking for a driver that did not come on the CD that supposedly had all of the drivers. Even though I am very computer saavy, I was stumped and found it only after doing searches on the net for the name of the driver. Luckily, other people have had this problem and someone had posted a fix. An email to customer support was responded to within 24 hours and the driver was sent--but why have a product with a known issue and then not fix it? I am a big D-Link fan but this was disappointing as I wasted over 2 hours of time figuring it out."
1,loses connection,"Very disappointing. Doesn't like to talk to our D-link wireless router; drops the connection frequently and seems unable to pick it back up. Our older wireless-b D-link card performs much better. Since it can perform at times, I suspect it's a software or firmware problem."
4,This one finally worked,"I have several Linksys wireless adapters, usb, pci, etc that I could never configure with a Linksys wireless cable modem/router. This one worked fine. Go figure. I had to reinstall once when it stopped working by (1) removing software, (2) removing the card, (3) reinstalling software, (4) reinstalling the card. Installing software 1st seems to be an important step."
1,Avoid this junk,Now I see why this thing was only $20 retail. Its a piece of junk. It takes forever to connect to a router that is only 10 feet away. The highest download speed I achieved was 53 Kb/s and I am on a 6 Mb/s network. The latest drivers at the D-Link site are 2 years old. Now I see why there was a big stack of them at the retail store. They are trying to dump all the obselete junk on the consumers. I took it back to exchange for a Linksys
1,awful - don't waste your time.,"thought i'd suggest this to a friend to try. Complete waste of time. Intermittent setup problems with win xp, had to disable then enable all the time. XP configuration would only intermittently show out our home network that would always show up on netstumbler, even after disabling all security features.I'm pretty good with computers, and can build a computer from parts. So despite some negative reviews, I was wondering how bad could this be? Well, it's going back in exchange for a linksys."
1,Bad,"I have problems keeping connections. Sometimes I am connected but no data flows. Sometimes I stay connected for a very long time, sometimes not. Range from router has nothing to do with it, I had the same problems three feet from my router.Very puzzling, unreliable performance. I plan on returning the item."
1,Used computer Device purchase,I did receive the wireless card WITHOUT an antenna...(did I say wireless??) And it was not packed with any safe guard for the pc expansion card as it was wrapped in a plastic shopping bag...OUCH!!!...Guess you get what you pay for...this is not intended to reflect on the manufactor of the device nor AMAZON.COM as I did buy it used...I does work when the router is near the computer though....'J LeeS FL.
4,Maybe you people should get better rigs....,"I bought the product, and it worked great. With Windows XP Professional, I didn't even have to put in the install disc for the drivers.The only problem I have is the lack of X64 drivers, and low signal. But since it's an Atheros chip, finding X64 drivers for it from other cards. And the signal strength can be saved by replacing the attenea with a cheap 6 dBi one."
5,Bullets and Octane! AWESOME!!!!!!,"I have seen Bullets and Octane LIVE three times, met Gene and got autographs, they ROCK! First saw them as an opening act for Avenged Sevenfold and had absolutely no clue as to who they were. Remembered their name the best that I could being they were the best band at the entire show and it just so happened that they came to Kansas City again about 5 months later, this time headlining in a small club.They were AMAZING again! This CD is as good as it gets, I own all of their others except for a very rare one of which I am constantly on the look out for. Cannot wait to see them again and again!!! Buy this CD, fall in love with it and then go get their others, they are all fantastic, never a let down."
3,did not fit,"The product was very nice and I loved the way it felt but it did not fit my infant car seat. I have a Graco Safe Seat and the product was too small for it. If it had fit I would rate this with a high mark but, that is the only reason it got 3 stars."
4,Kreg PHD Book The Pocket Hole Drilling Jig Project Count Book,This book helped me utiilize my Kreg Pocket Screw kit to it's full advantage on my last project. I intend to modify a couple of the projects to meet my needs but fully intend to use the pocket screw concept to build...
3,True French,"This was a wonderful look at Paris, and the story, though disjointed at times, follows a theme of memories with ties to the present. Beautifully filmed, beautiful music, lovely costumes. Presented France and the French in a very true fashion. Worth watching if you love France as I do."
2,"Thumbs down, s'il vous plait.","A perfectly awful film in the typical Merchant Ivory boring-but-stylish mode. But for the presence of the incomparable Jean Moreau and the stylish-ness of the interiors and exteriors (Madeleine Castaing's Paris apartment etc etc), it rates the two thumbs down category. As a comic relief,don't fast forward the scenes that include klutzy Sean Young (tripping about in spiked heels and mini-skirt)who in a truly forgettable scene is whisked away to the dance floor to perform a tango so clumsily executed as to cause Rudolph Valentino to turn over in his grave.Another low-point is the odious musical scene with her would-be lover played by Josh Hamilton. Then there's Nell Carter, hamming it up as the devoted servant. Did Jean-Marie Besset and George Trow, who wrote this trite, ridiculous screenplay,laugh all the way to the bank? This might be ok to watch on a lazy summer afternoon with a Campari and soda on hand. The combination will bring on a well-deserved siesta."
1,This film should be illegal,"One of the worst movies ever. A sorry waste of time and film. The directing is trite, the performances are ridiculous and even the sets and costumes offer no redemption. Just awful. Outdone only by Merchant's other film ""Cotton Mary"". Really, the guy should stick to producing and let Ivory do the directing. I feel for the actors who participated in this farce and hope that they were able to pick up their careers after such an embarrassment."
1,Unquestionably horrendous,"This film was so bad that I could not stop watching it it - Iwanted to see what trite, overworked movie cliche would pop up next. I laughed my head off in the the scenes where I believe the intent was for the viewer to be sobbing his or her head off. The only excusable actor was Sean Young: we already know how truly terrible she is. But for the rest of the cast to come down to her level - shame on them.This is currently tops on my list of movies I love to hate"
4,Good Basic Breed Info Book,"This is a good basic breed information book on the English Setter, but leans more toward the Dog Show breed / standards than training a dog for hunting. Still very informative about the English Setter breed."
5,The only one you need,"The original series is the greatest thing ever in anime, I am convinced. However, the first movie is a rehash of the series, followed by the first half of this film. If you want the full set, buy both movies."
1,What the ...?,"Here is a summation of this movie: mech fighting, screaming, and then random statements/conversations using the words reality, dreams, life, death, heart, being, etc. interchangably. I heard this was supposed to be a more coherent finale than the last two episodes of the series. Wrong. It completely devolves at the end into the randomness that was the last two episodes. I actually think I liked the first ending better for its no-holds-barred chaos, but that's not saying much. This series started out so well and then it just slowly fell apart. What is it with Japanese storylines that it can't finish logically even when it starts well? Xenogears, Final Fantasy, Akira, I've about had it. Stuff that is nonsensical at the beginning (Akira) I don't expect to make sense at the end. But this was good. For many episodes.Bah.The worst part of this movie is not the incoherent ending, but the fact that it made me wish I hadn't started watching to begin with."
4,Yur mind will never be prepared for this,I have watched all the episodes of the NGE series and i admit after the first three episodes i was hooked and i watched the entire series hoping to find the answers to all the questions i needed to ask. in the end all i ended up with was a feeling of incompletion. this movie is great but DO NOT WATCH BEFORE SERIESit continues straight from the series and cannot stand alone. To conclude the series was a marvolous revalation in the art of story telling and animation. Every peson whos ready for a wild ride into peoples mind should watch this.It changed my view on humanityWarning only watch when u have time because u will be so consumed with it it will occupy your mind for along timePS to all the losers who dissed Evangelion :It probably never got through your thick heads in the first place and if you dont like it go watch disney movies (which by the way decrease your IQ)
1,Waste of time.,This is the ending of Neon Genesis? Ok so the whole ending is about shinjin still crying like a little girl acting likey a punk. Awful! And the actual series ending was even worse! It's just an insight of what everyone is thinking about in the movie. Which drags on forever. This series could have had a way better ending.
1,Disappointment,"Disappointment is an understatement. I was hoping for a suitable closure to a great series, but found mindless babble. Looking at the series and the movies as a whole, it looks like the creator just didn't know how to end a great run, so decided to make it as vague and abstract as possible in hopes that people would think more of it then what it really is."
3,"Great visuals, but...","... What the heck is going on? This final episode of the Neon Genesis saga doesn't really answer any questions that the last two episodes of the original series posed. It looks great, the sound and music are superb, well worth the cost of the DVD; but it seems to me like a lot of sound and fury signifying a lot of nothing.There's a lot of action going on, a lot of people buy it in very dramatic ways, there are lots of explosions but the whole wrapup towards the end will have you reaching for Dramamine or aspirin (the choice is yours).It seems that the creator of this Magnum Opus is trying to make some grand statement about life, death, and the universe that gets lost towards the end in this ball of confusion. Enjoy!"
5,Joys of Rebirth,"The DVD is fine, transfer is a little faded but adds a dreamy quality to a very surreal film. Few extras, but it does not matter much as this film is basically a companion piece to the series. Great conclusion. Excellent film. Now if I could only find live action films of Hideaki Anno I would be set!"
2,Some closure but still not enough,"I saw the whole series (Which was great! except for you know what? The end ) but whats with the live action snapper-heads on end of Evangelion did they have anything to do with the story umm nope and if they did (yeah right )what was their meaning????? Great battles but the ending well lets just say there should be another one ""End of the End of Evangelion. Im a big fan of the Evangelion series great color animation The voice actors were impecable I just wanted a clearer ending and if you buy End you dont need Death and rebrith. I highly recommend the series its one of the greatest.."
2,Huh?,"Fans of Evangelion? So was I until I watchEd this movie. Shinji is the most annoying character ever. He is all the most trivial problems of puberty lumped into one annoying whiny little jerk. Shinji is ""afraid to shower in gym class"" timeS a million. If you like those Animes that have long pointless and confusing endings, then this is for you. I guess Human Insturmentality is really code for ""bore me to death with the pointless psycho-analysis of a shivering turd"". And besides that, all I have to say about this movie is: What is going on? Seriously, I have no idea what happened except that I used to like this series and now I'm ever so angry."
4,Welcome to armaggedon at its creativity,"When I first placed this DVD into the player I had to wonder if all will Go will with this finale or will I have to weep in just pure sadness. But the only answer I can give you in a nutshell, this movie is a jaw-dropping experience that will leave in wonder and in awe and some of the graphic visuals that is brings to teh plate but at the same time the music to it makes it will place you even more into the scenery...especially in one big scene where the beginning of the end starts its orcestrated performance will make your mouth drop at the same time leave you in awe that the visual wearness it produces. I feel that this is a great ending to a very Great and contrvercial movie...it answers a bit of the question that the final part of the series didn't ..."
4,Finally what it was all about!,"This film will finally show you what 3rd Impact was supposed to do, why the clandestine committee wanted to bring it about, and some more details (some quite visceral) of what the Evas and Angels are/were. No, I'm not going to spoil it for you.If you were left with these questions burning in your mind after the end of the Neon Genesis: Evangelion series, they will be settled for you. And you can skip forward to learning them from this movie and miss watching Death and Rebirth without any significant loss (imho)."
5,Incredible Viewing Experiance,First things first if your thinking of buying this make sure you have done one thing. You MUST see the entire series otherwise you will be completely lost. This series is beautiful the animimation is amazing the story is gripping. The Voice acting is great. In the dub its okay but i prefer the sub. The fight scenes are awesome. But if your in it just for fight scenes leave now because Evangelion really will blow your mind.
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,"I love the movie *so far*, but DUE TO DISC DEFECTS, HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WATCH THE LAST 20 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE. MANGA YOU HAVE TOTALLY DROPPED THE BALL ON THIS ONE. I have two stand-alone players that BOTH completely freeze at the layer change. I have returned the DVD 5 times. Every single disc does the exact same thing on both players (Sony DVP-S530D & Apex 1100W).Unacceptable. I'd have better luck with VCDs off Ebay. Unacceptable. Completely unacceptable. Unbelievable. This is probably the only important anime release that will ever pass through Manga, and thank goodness; they seriously f**ked up. I can't believe this foolish, utterly careless treatment the End of Evangelion. Blasphemy. All buyers beware."
3,Umm... What I Miss?,"I watched this movie with my friend who was a big fan of this series. He warned me about not knowing what was going on. Since I read the first 3 books, I felt that I knew enough to know what was going on. Boy I was wrong. There were so many things I missed that I uncovered when I bought the box set for this series. After watching the series, I now (sort of) understand what was going on. Still, it's hard to follow."
2,A wasted buy,"I purchased End of Eva, because i had anticipated it for over a year now. The last two tapes in the Eva series were confusing and hard to follow. Now they come out with Death and Rebirth (purchased a month earlier), and the End of Eva. These two releases in themselves are pointless. First off if you want to see the end i suggest you only buy the end and not death and rebirth. Death and rebirth consists of only a 30 minute confusing recap of what happened already, and a 30 minute teaser for the last movie. The End of evangelion consists of the same episode teaser they give you along with another short continuation on it. To be honest the action was great in the End, but still it was not worth buying it. They might as well of kept the original ending, because it made as much sense as this one did. My opinion is to buy it and see how you like it, but hold onto that recipt."
2,My review,"What do you get when you put a number of clinically depressed animators into a studio and provide them with a non-ending supply of acid? You get the Eva series and movie.I was looking forward to seeing the wimp Singi choose life and kick some eva/angle ass at the end with his yellow-winged demon Eva01. But instead he becomes Jesus. People who watch this movie and see beauty, thought-provoking artistry and the answers to life need therapy. Seriously, get Prozac and stop sniffing glue!By the way, the movie in summary is that everyone keeps getting bigger and bigger wings."
1,What the [heck]?,"... I've seen the entire eva series, and frankly wasn't too impressed with it. With that said, this film makes no sense what so ever. After watching it I thought that I had been on an acid trip. Some people may say this was ""deep and philosophical"", but I think it was just plain whacked out...Moreover, the violence and sex in the movie was really disturbing. Shinji masturbating in front of a comotose Asuka was just sick.Unless you are a hard core eva fan, or a stoner avoid this DVD at all costs!"
1,It [is not good]!!!,"I can't say anything nice about this movie really. If you weren't a fans of the series then you're going to hate this movie. It tries to finish the Evagelion story as best it can, but the main character Shinji seems more whinier now than he did in the series. I thought the series Evangelion was just average, but the movie, I though it [was not good] big time.I can think of a lot other anime movies I would watch over this thing."
5,wow.,"Evangelion was a stunning and suprisingly good series. The last two episodes (25 and 26) were beautifully done and astoundingly deep. Though they were great, they were rejected by most. Enter ""End of Eva"" to clear things up, or make them even more confusing.""EoE"" is not a simple physical version of 25 and 26, rather it is a completely different ending. Things end differently in the series. Go watch the last two eps, then watch this movie. Be warned, this is one of the most disturbing things i've every seen in my entire life. To put it lightly, its gonna drive you nuts.The animation and sound is top-notch. I would expect nothing less of Production IG and Gainax. The commentaries are also very good on this disc.Suggestions: Watch the series, all 26 eps. If not, pick up ""Evangelion: Death and Rebirth,"" which contains a non-linear summary of the series, as well as an Eva encyclopedia.Warning: Contains nudity, violence, and will haunt those who watch it, GARUANTEED."
4,warning,"I think I should tell you, this movie, the alt ending to the series, does contain a lot more disturbing sceans the series never had. Like a lot of you have probably heard it DOES depict the end of the world. Anyone who finds that disturbing should not watch this.P.S. I gave it 4 stars because it is the end of an AMAZING show."
5,This is a warning,"I've come to the conclusion that the people who didnt give this movie a 5 star rating, must have been watching the dubbed version. If you are interested in watching this series, please watch it in Japanese with subtitles. The english voice actors are terrible. The downside to the to the subs are that they are an exact translation. The dubbed voices did a better job of translating, but the actors are still realy bad. So if there is a part that didn't make sense, watch it over in the dubbed, but don't watch the entire series that way, it will ruin your eva experience."
4,Over extends the point,A very detailed account of the Topenkoff division which seeks to show that all SS where part of the concentration camp system. Whist Sydnor proves this for this division his subsequent generaslisation to all other waffen SS divisions looks hurried and (even if true) not supported by Sydnor. Generally well written
4,This is a very great book.,"This book is about Jack, Annie and Teddy. Teddy is a sorcerer. Jack always has questions. And Annie can talk to birds. What I liked about it was that Annie talked to a bird. And Annie asked what the bird's name was, and the bird said that his name was Rok. What I didn't like was that Teddy was locked up in a cage. I recommend people should read this book. I think the age for this book is 6 and up. This is a very great book."
5,Great series.,"My son absolutely adores this series. He just turned 7. I still am reading the stories to him, but he can pick up some words and phrases as I read to him. We read the series in order and now are beginnning to reread them.This story can be read individually, but I recommend reading the earlier ones to get to know the characters. Jack and Annie are very likeable. They try to achieve their goal with the assistance of clues given to them by the magician Merlin. It is good for problem solving and also has alot of educational tidbits."
5,My book,It's a good bookI think u should read it is funny and interesting lots of young kids will read it
1,It was about 3 kind friends who wanted to help out,I really liked this book because it was haunted casel with ghoasts but then yoll just have to find outBreeana Harris
3,Sold to me by Winter Ventures,"Not up to Amazon standards. It was listed as ""used, very good"" but the spine looks like it has been gnawed by mice! As a school librarian replacing books at the end of the year, I do not have time to negotiate with Winter Ventures for another copy. The school will be closed, so I repaired this and shelved it."
2,A poor imitation of ABBA,"When i first listened a sond on T.V. i thote it was great, but when i bought the CD i was 100% disappointed. Some of the songs (not all) are poorly. She trys to be like ABBA but she is just an imitation. And her voise is too deap for a girl. Sorry charlotte but this is not one of the best swidish albums."
4,A Colorado band with their own sound.,"I first heard this group in high school during the late 70s. I liked their radio hits such as ""You are the Woman"", Livin' ain't Livi'"" and the top 40 hit ""Cinderella"". Those were from the highly rated self titled album, ""Firefall"". I was very impressed with the cover art that helped put you in the mood for their unique sound. I eventually caught them in concert at the Aladin in Las Vegas which was great as well. This album has some hit & misses but I really got in to the tune ""Baby"" which is a beautiful melancholy ballad. I just wish I could have caught the group's recent concert here in Denver."
1,Not worth the money,"I was astounded when the book arrived. It fits in the palm of my hand and is thinner then some of the MP3 players on the market today. Although true to Seuss, the content was disappointing and I found the entries a far stretch at times to fit in to 'success' tips. If you want tips for success, purchase Seuss' ""Oh the places you'll go"" - That book is worth the money."
3,A Twist of Lennon review,"Cynthia Lennon's is quite interesting. I love reading anything about John Lennon. I want to know everything there is to know about John. However, I expected much more details, she failed to give specific details and dates. In fact, the dates that she did include were in correct. But I do recommend this book to any John Lennon fan to get an inside on being the wife of John Lennon. This book proves that John did love Cynthia. John was a loving person and he did care a lot of Cyn. I give this book 3 stars out of 5."
2,A Twist Of Disappointment,"It's not really her fault, but Cynthia Lennon has written a fairly bland book. She obviously doesn't realize what is so interesting about the guy, and what' makes a decent memoir. Gossip, juicy stories etc. For me, one of the most fascinating things about Lennon was that he was a Liverpool thug who had to wear a Beatle suit. Cynthia Lennon really comes across as being a bit dim. For my money, the most interesting part of a famous person's life, is what they were like before they were famous - she could have done a better job on this early period. For a decent book, read Albert Goldman's book or Pete Shotton's ""In My Life""."
5,Beautiful,"What a beautiful CD. This music is so flowing and moving. I use it alot at night for relaxation and sleep. JC is a wonderful song writer, piano player and singer (along with his other instruments he plays) He's just a wonderful musician all around."
2,If you like exotic grooves you might like it...,"I on the other had take melody/harmony over rythm any day. I don't listen to this CD anymore. It isn't bad but doesn't have any place in my musical landscape. Perhaps it is the lack of melody or similarity of rythms.You might enjoy it if you like rythms but I would think most would agree ""Piano with a View"" is a much stronger effort. Jonathan should stick to melodic romantic or jazz compositions. They are just so much better!"
3,The Erie Train Boy,"Good, typical Horatio Algier yarn about poor boy makes good. This one does not hold a candle to ""Ragged Dick and Mark the Matchboy"", my all time favorite of this author."
4,Erie Train Boy,The book was received as described and in the condition that was described. Order was processed promptly and delivered to me before I expected. Pleasure to do business with this vendor.
4,A little small but mighty!,I was at first disappointed at the size but after setting it up (which is super easy) and then using it a bit the size is fine. Very user friendly and a breeze to find the different time zones for anyplace you want. Love it!
4,Sierra Hoyle Casino/Hoyle Card Games,"The format is not compatible with my Windows XP system and will not download, so we play them from the disc. There is enough variety to keep us entertained for quite a while."
1,Big Disappointment For The Price!!,"Save your money. There are better chess instructions, for free, on the internet! Two thumbs down on this one!"
4,Facial Treatment,My daughter requested a Microdermabrasion kit for Christmas and I am sure she will love this one by Revlon.
5,and i thought ken jennings was genius...,"this 5-songer is brilliant! i mean more than ken jennings betting $7800 on aquatic animals where the question is ""what is the elephant seal?""i love phoenix, her space holiday, blonde redhead, my new english bulldog, and langonisa at elvie's. if this sounds like you, then you will adore ""cottage"" by the merkin dream.just listen, and you will see."
3,So-so...,"Well, to tell you the truth, I was really expecting more.I downloaded some songs off of full moon online. I bought this hoping I could listen to music that I had never heard. It turns out, ALL of the songs I downloaded were the same songs on that disk! I felt stupid for buying something that I already had. Unless you want a mint condition Full moon track that is original, then go right ahead if you are a collecter, but if you just want to listen to good music, you'd be better off downloading it, for free."
4,"Big book, essential resource, but VERY short on words","I'm not unhappy that I bought this book, however it wasn't what I expected.This is NOT a book with anecdotes or stories or any sort of written description about any plant. It is instead a massive database dump of thousands of plants along with a standard mini-suite of information for each of them: other names, where found, what its used for, etc. This information is presented in a non-reading friendly, compact manner.This is strictly a reference book and not intended for actual reading or browsing. It is valuable for conducting research IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER RESOURCES - the web, other texts, etc. I could see it being used effectively as a cross reference for finding leads/keywords to be used to track down more information about a given plant/malady/location, etc. elsewhere.Indispensable, but not standalone."
5,I'm waiting for new books of Ulrich.,"Ulrich's book is not excellent guide for not only HR managers, it should be read by all professionals working with human and their values. I'm waiting for new books of Ulrich."
2,Really dry book,"While the book is full of good information for the soon to be HR professional, it is also quite dated and the reading can be dry. However, it is a good resource to keep on the bookshelf."
2,Not So Good,"I am not a human resource champion or guru, but I do have an MBA and my approach is from the IT corner.I found this book tough going and very academic.There was so little coming out of it I skipped a few chapters.Sorry about that"
4,It's a classic,"When Fortune Magazine published ""Taking on the Last Bureaucracy"" in 1996, a gauntlet was thrown down for the HR community. Thomas Stewart, Fortune columnist, indicted the professional Human Resources community on many fronts. The most damning was, though, that HR added nothing to the achievement of strategic organizational purpose.This book was the best response to that challenge, and it was a great start. I've assigned this book to my HR management graduate students since 1998, and have not regretted it.Yes, it is somewhat outdated now, but should be read for its role in reshaping the very definition of HR work. Sorry to say that its companion volume, ""Delivering Results,"" is now out of print, but it can still be obtained.A recommendation: read this book along with ""The HR Scorecard."" They work together almost seamlessly."
4,Excellent way to organize!,"Have you ever tried to find a lid for a pot and gotten frustrated by the clanging sound as you dig around in the cabinet? Well, I have and I hate that sound and the reminder of the disorganization of how different people unload the dishwasher and throw stuff in the cabinets. I guess I should be happy they unload the dishwasher, but still.... so I got this organizer and I love it. The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a little narrow so I can get most of the lids in there securely, the others I sort of balance between the two rows-it works, but another 1/4 inch wide would have allowed the lids to fit in there better (we have a mix of the flatter All Clad lids and the more dome-like glass lids with tall handles)."
2,Not Thrilled,"I bought this toy thinking it would be good for my kids home schooling. The older kids thought it was childish and my 4 year old got tired of using her finger and having to keep a tight fist so her palm or other fingers would not get in the way and make the wrong word play. She also grew tired of having to point all the time. The 2 books that came with it are flemsy and short. I just found out there are only 7 more books available. Perhaps, if more books were available I would not be so disapointed."
3,Not much bang for your buck!,"I was so excited when I found out my son was receiving this for Christmas from his Grandparents. He also got 2 additional books, one of them his favorite - Dragontales. The excitement over this gift lasted about 2 weeks. Since then he has taken this out about 2 times and he plays with it for about 15 minutes, gets frustrated and bored and put it away. He will be 5 years old next month, so he isn't too young for it.For us, it was not a good gift, but maybe my almost 2 year old daughter will like it one day?!"
3,Weak sister,"To keep this plain and simple, I was disapointed in this sytstem and I have returned it. While the finish is nice, the touch pads were not sensitive at all, and the voice recordings skipped so bad you couldn't understand what they were saying.We bought a Leap Pad this weekend and are so far enjoying it much more. The pen helps children with their ability to learn to write as well."
5,Love this product!,Love this one and it is my favorite toy for my son. I will recommend to everyone to purchase this item.
2,Almost 3 yr old boy only tears the pages up,"My son has never liked this toy from day 1. He tried to touch the pictures, but it is so sensitive that his arm and elbow would touch other pictures. He has ripped up the books. Maybe when he is a little older he will be interested."
5,Great educational toy,My son received the Power Touch for Christmas with several books. He is 2 1/2 and he loves it. He will lay on the floor and play with it for an hour. It is very easy to use since they just touch items on the page. I felt it was easier for him to use then the Leap Pad. It also has some great books. They are all characters that he loves to watch. The only thing that is negative is that he doesn't understand yet then when you change the book you have to change the cartridge. But I think he will learn that as he gets older.
3,Power Touch Learning System,"My son recieved this from my Sister-in-law as a christmas present. I had been trying to decide between this one and the leap frog and when we were in the stores, this is the one that my son kept going back to. So much easier to use than the stylus and i like it because the volume is not so loud as the leap frog. Most toys i have to tape over the speaker because they are so loud, and this one, on the highest setting, is still easy on the ears."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I got the PowerTouch Learning System for my 3 years old son. He loved that until the day that he got tired of Elm's book. I went to look for the Dora's book and other books to buy for him. The Dora's is not for sale at any store and there are just few different books avaliable in the market. I got really frustated. I wish I had gotten the Leap frog, they have a way more books which keeps the toy very interesting for the kids.Another problem is that while playing with it, my son eventually touch other parts of the book with another areas of his hand when he points a figure, which make the PowerTouch Learning System starting spelling or reading another word instead of the one that he intended, making him confused at first. Even without touching the book, a closer approach to it, is more than enough to activate. Now I like the idea of the pen in the leap frog. I would never buy this toy again!"
3,Great Idea - Limited growth,"I bought two of these last year for 2 of my grandchildren. They grew tired or bored with these quickly. I ""researched"" the differences between the others on the market and decided this was definately the best. Both of my grandchildren like reading and interactive toys as well as computer like things. However, these have not been played with much. They each have 4 books to their set. I had hoped to keep supplementing with new books but the choices have not been near as good or interesting as the comptetiion. They wanted the leappad books and didn't really understand why those books wouldn't work in their system.Overall a great toy. It just didn't keep up with new books."
1,Don't buy this!!!!!,"Bought one, worked for 1/2 day, exchanged, then bought another, didn't work at all. Returned, got a LEAPPAD, it's much better product. The only thing I like about Power Touch was that could use finger without the stylus pen...."
3,It was O.K.,"My three year old received this for Christmas last year with two additional books. Since then I have not been able to find any additional books. My daughter became bored with it in a few days. Compared to the Leap Pad learning system which she has at her grandparents house it doesn't come close. She is constantly playing with the Leap Pad. There are tons of books for the Leap Pad. This toy sits on the shelf collecting dust. The other problem she had with it is that the pad is so sensitive she would touch something and if her hand brushed the page somewhere else it would switch to whatever she brushed against. This is very frustrating for a three-year-old. Also one of her books bent, and when it is bent the touch pad does not always recognize where you touch. Another frustration for her."
3,NOT ALL THAT IMPRESSIVE,We got this toy for our daughter when she was two years old and she didn't play with it. She is now four and still deosn't play with it. The books that go with it are not that great and are limited.The cartriges that go with the books are hard to keep track of because they are small. The learning system messes up and gets off track very easily. I don't recomend this toy and will be selling my hardly used power touch at a garage sale.
5,Amazing!,"I bought this at a garage sale fro my three year old niece - who is very advanced. And no, I'm not embarrassed that I bought it for $5, including two books - and it still had the box!Anyway - this toy is so cool! Even I was having fun with it before I wrapped it for her. It's simple and easy to use and, better yet, one toy can accommodate a huge range of experience and learning!This is totally beyond amazing and I recommend it to anyone! My son is 15 months old and I definitely plan on getting it for him! (even if it's not at a garage sale -- I would pay full price for it!)"
2,Could be way better..was disappointed...,"I've always preferred Leap Frog products over Fisher Price, but i thought this product seemed more functional as it didn't use a pen. While there is both entertaining and educational value to this toy i feel like it could definitely be better made. The books are a bit flimsy and can get bent easily from just being turned by little hands. If your child likes to tilt books towards them to look at, as opposed to lying them flat on the ground this will cause much frustration as the book will fall off the system. Overall i think this could be a fun toy, but it isn't..i think if i consider an electronic book system again i'd head for the Leap Frog systems first."
4,Great toy,My 3.5 year old just received this from grandpa from christmas and loves it. It is so much easier to use than the leap pad that he had for only about a year and broke. The pen from the lep pad always got pulled on and was much harder for him to use. The Power Touch is great for him because he will have it for a long time.
5,A Plesant surprise over disappointing My first leappad,"My daughter just received this for her 3rd birthday!I was apprehensive after being pretty disappointed with the my first leappad.It is a hit with my 5 1\2 year old as much as the 3 year old!Both can use it easily, and differently.They dont need me to do anything for them and the cartridges ALWAYS work unlike the my first leappad.I love how it is that versitile for both ages.It even has things the kids can play with no book or cartridge in it! Using the alphabet printed on the sides.A very pleasant surprise here!"
3,Disappointed in this product,We got this for our daughter for her 3rd birthday.She got bored of this really fast.She is now 4 and hardly messes w/ it at all.I agree w/ the other lady that the books are limited.And it is easy to push many things at once and that confuses younger children.The cartiages are very hard to keep track of they are so small.My 2 yr old son has pretty much destoryed most of the books (the books are pretty easy to rip).This could be a great idea if a few things were fixed.The only pro I can think of about this thing is it doesnt seem to suck batteries all that bad.
3,How about an alternate ending?,"Without question, this is beautifully done by everyone involved. (And if they teach this in German high schools, its no wonder they don't have the dropout problems we do).But the story turns on a person being so ashamed of being illiterate that she would rather spend life in prison vs. saying ""Well shoot. I can't read or write so I guess that answers your question!""Obviously, most people didn't have a problem with that and one presumes Hannah is so overcome with guilt that she feels she deserves a life sentence. She never gives any such indication but its the only other explanation.All of this is a monstrous stretch but even if true, her one great admirer, who happens to be learning that there is no morality, only law, withholds information that's vital to this most serious case. Of course, it would have been predictable for him to jump up and say ""She can't write!"" but it would give the story what it lacks--plausibility."
3,Just Discovered This Movie...,"I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS MOVIE UNTIL I WAS WATCHING HBO THE OTHER NIGHT.IT WAS VERY INTERESTING, BUT A LITTLE FAR-FETCHED.THE FOLLOWING INFO IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE (or for those who don't care to see it):NOT KNOWING EACH OTHERS NAME UNTIL AFTER 3 DAYS OF LOVEMAKING?NO ONE, BUT NO ONE COULD COME FORWARD IN HER TRIAL TO PROCLAIM HER ILLITERACY?!SHE HAD NO FAMILY OR FRIENDS WHO KNEW THAT SHE WAS ILLITERATE?!WHY DID SHE WAIT UNTIL SHE WAS A FREE WOMAN TO KILL HERSELF-SEEMS LIKE SHE WOULD HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE THE 20 SOMETHING YEARS WERE UP.ALSO, IN THE PART AFTER SHE DIED & HER WILL WAS READ TO HER EX-LOVER.I THOUGHT IT WAS STUPID WHEN AT THE END OF THE WILL IT READ THAT SHE WANTED TO TELL HIM ""HELLO""???!!!! WHAT WAS SO TOUCHING ABOUT THAT TO MAKE HIM CRY SO MUCH?!SHE SHOULD HAD WROTE THAT SHE ALWAYS ""LOVED"" HIM THRU ALL THOSE YEARS-- THAT WOULD HAD MADE MORE SENSE FOR HIM TO CRY, CAUSE I WOULD HAVE CRIED TOO..."
2,Formulaic,"Ineptly conventional. Tacky music, pointless accents, fake eroticism, endless pauses meant to be meaningful. Movie-making by the numbers."
2,Why the hoopla?,"I have not read the book, and I waited until the DVD to see the film. After all the Oscar nominations and rave reviews by friends, I suppose I expected something more. Instead, this movie is really about something less. A young man has an affair with his first lover, a damaged woman, whom he remembers for the rest of his life. That's it. The characters are one-dimensional, we never really see what drives Ralph Fiennes' character, and there isn't even much of a story line. If it weren't for the Holocaust factor, this movie may not have gotten a second look. Even that factor plays a supremely small, albeit admittedly powerful, role in the film. In the end we have a lifetime of lost love and unexplored secrets played quietly by two great actors. Great acting, directing, and cinematography seems to have puffed up an otherwise simple story. One kept hoping for a remarkable twist at the end that never comes. I really don't see what all the excitement is about."
2,Kate Winslet Gets Neck'id,"This movie starts off as a pretty disturbing film. First, if this would have been a 30 something man having sex with full nudity on film with a 15 year old girl it would be scandalous and seriously it probably would not even be made. But I guess we are suppose to forget that this German Mary Kay Laterno is a child molestor cause she can't read. But anyway, it is pretty much soft core porn for the first half of the movie. And keep in mind I have nothing against soft core porn. But then the story takes a turn and I am suppose to care that this totally vile piece of human scum had feeling and had been in love. I feel and felt no sympathy for her. She was a child molestor and she was a murdering scum."
2,why it takes so long???,I ordered this book on September 8th. Today is September 25th and I saw it's still hasn't been shipped. Why it takes so long???
2,Pushing all the right drama buttons.,"This movie is Oscar material, it has the right ingredients:Holocaust tinged story line? Check.Actors making dramatic, serious speeches. Yep.A ""tragic death"" (other than the general Nazi genocide) near or at the end? Check again.""Adult"" themes (on-screen banging)? Check.The crew that put this film together really know how to fish for that Oscar.Yes, you are being manipulated by this movie like a an Italian chef manipulates pizza dough. But sit back and enjoy the experience, if you must."
1,Slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww,"While this is a fairly interesting, albeit somewhat predictable story, the movie would be worth viewing ONLY if it lasted about 20 minutes. I, who have lots of energy, felt as though I needed a nap after viewing ""The Reader."""
1,An insult to all the victims of Holocaust,"Any human has feelings, soul and only one life to live, and as such, any person can find empathy and sympathy. But this is exactly what Nazis ignored, ignored the value of millions of lives. How can I, just for a minute allow myself to feel empathy for one of them? That would be treason."
5,Great film,"So smart, and heart breaking. It is a different approach to Germany and the holocaust and Kate Winslet is amazing, as are her opposing lead actors."
4,Wonderful movie,"When people talk favorably about Dramas like Benjamin Button, I shake my head because although that movie is on a Grand scale the characters do almost nothing for me. The Reader is exactly the opposite. Wonderful story with complex characters. This is what should have been nominated for a record number of awards not fluff like Benjamin Button."
4,good weepie,"im not a big fan of kates but in this film shes on top form great story and she pulls all the stops out ,she will have you in tears and you carnt help feeling sorry for her ,great acting .brian"
4,Unique Story,"The Reader is a solid four star movie. The story is completely unique and is a movie that is dark, thought provoking, and disturbing. Kate Winslet is very good, obviously she won an Oscar for her performance but I didn't believe she was amazing. Here character is entirely believable and has a certain realness about her. There is no doubt that The Reader is an adult content film with the amount of nudity and sex taking place between a 30+ year old and a 15 year old boy.It is a solid film and I would recommend it based off the story. It does captivate you and really makes you wonder about the mind of two main characters. How do two people get so disturbed and also it shows what a situation like that can do to you the rest of your life. This isn't your typical love story and that is why I enjoyed it. The story spans over 30 years and changes as all relationships do. Definately a Unique and solid film"
3,Blah Oscar-bait,"The Bottom Line:A decent film for its first two-thirds despite Kate Winslet's occasionally laughable accent, The Reader's lamentable third act turns what could have been a moderately-insightful film about German post-WWII guilt into a middling piece of Oscar-bait with a phoned-in performance by Ralph Fiennes and a whole bunch of contrived, artificial scenes; even in the weak year that was 2008 in film the idea that this middlebrow piece of filmmaking got a Best Picture and Director nomination is ridiculous.2.5/4"
3,mixed up,"I sometimes feel I should have enjoyed this movie, which aspires to be ""challenging"", a lot more than I did. The story of crime and morality in the Nazi era is never one to be callow about, but this film seems like it's not sure what it wants to be about: the horrors of the concentration camps of Nazi Germany, legal issues and moral ambiguities, the nobility of a fallen woman, or kinky sex. Kate Winslett seems like the real star of this movie, for which she finally won an Academy Award (uh-oh, does this mean that she'll never be in a good movie again?), and Ralph Fiennes plays her conflicted young lover as a conflicted adult. He frowns a lot. Kate Winslet looks as young in ""old lady makeup"" in this film as she did in ""Titanic."" Will they never learn?"
3,We can always learn from others around us,"I found this movie great because it serves as a true reminder that both the good and the bad of others around us serves as a true teaching tool. If others around us lie it becomes easier (via peer pressure) to lie as well and if others around us teach and share love it is easier for us to love.2009 seems to be the year of WWII/Concentration camp movies. In Tranzit, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, Valkyrie, and this one make 5 this year. 2007,2008 was the year of Afganistan, Iraq, Middle East, 9/11 related movies.Passion leads to great movies and war movies WWII or 9/11 movies usually contain a lot of passion. This one also serves as a great moral guide as well, enjoy The Reader if you have the chance to see it. Kate Winslet is becoming a much better actress. Not just pinning for Jack on the Titanic but she has so much more to offer! This picture is just part of that so much more!"
2,If you make a movie about the German history do it right!,I watched the movie on tv and I am glad I didn't buy it. My main point of criticism is that all the props (e.g. books) are English books. It bugged me to see that he reads an English book to her and she learned writing with an English book (they even mention in the movie that he only learns Latin and Greek at school). They suppose to be Germans - than use German books. Otherwise the movie is alright.
2,major disappointment,"I was unimpressed with this one. The first half was all about forbidden sex, and sex or no sex, the male lead never became a ""real man"" until the last minute or so of the movie. I figured out the female's first secret on their 2nd encounter and just guessed at her other secret and got it right. (I hate it when that happens!)The acting was good, but the story was blah!"
4,Painful to watch,"I do not reccomend this as great watching- but I appreciated it. The acting is GREAT, the story line is unique, the cinema fantastic, and I just could not get past the underage boy having sex with a 40 year old woman to dive into the lovestory part of this that was crucial. A young boy falls in love with an older woman, then later finds she is on trail for war crimes, and we see a span of 30 years of life. For those who squeam at inappropriate stuff this killed me the same way the squid and the whale did. It sucked out ALL of my happy. I acknowledge the work as being great."
3,Showed the human spirit,"This movie will make you think. It showed what someone will do, or allow themselves to indure, to protect others. The time frame is from the holocast in Germany. Watch it with that time frame in mind and you just like might like it. It's not an action or thriller movie."
4,One of the year's best,"Of the movie I must say that it is a powerful and engaging drama. The acting is top notch, as is the direction and cinematography. I walked away from this film in deep thought and have pondered the moral implications of the dilemma presented. I did find that the actions (and underlying motivations) of both the younger and older Michael Berg a bit wanting. One has to put some guess work into it, and though others have credibly filled in the gaps, I felt the film did not substantiate to this degree; thus I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Still, it is a movie I highly recommend seeing, and will generally give it rave reviews."
5,very good,it was a movie in which you could not help but think about it and analyze it for a couple of days.
5,Not to Read; That is The Agony,"Once the viewer has travelled past the stage-setting erotic images, the angst of the heroine becomes very vivid. Hers is a supremely formidable intellect shackeled by the inability to READ!! Ther is also a smidgeon of ""Third Reich"" mystic in her initial defense of the total lack of empathy shown to the early incineration of the victims of the ""Final Solution"" with which she is charged. The contrast of the failure of her lover to attempt any rescue is also descriptive of post-WW2 Germany. The cinematography is excellent, but the time shifting can be a little confusing. In total, the film-and Winslet's portrail--are Oscar-worthy."
5,The Reader,A very good story. A well made film. It will be the movie that made me respect and become a fan of Kate Winslet. I'll recommend this film many times more.
5,The Reader,"Excellent movie, the actresses and actors brought this one to life. There is quite a bit of nudity, but it does serve a purpose to the story. Truly makes you think about the dilemma Michael Berg, the main character has to deal with. It is a movie that has you wonder what would you do if you were in his shoes. Kate Winslet gives a excellent performance. It's a haunting and heart-breaking, and should not be missed."
5,THE READER,"WOW, WHAT A GREAT MOVIE. IT IS A SHAME WHAT EVERYONE WENT THRU FROM ALL PERSPECTIVES. EVERY PERFORMANCE SHOULD OF RECEIVED AWARDS."
3,Not so sure about this one,"I did not particularly like the story that this film tells but the acting is great. Kate Winslet's character befriends a teenage boy when he becomes ill with scarlet fever. The boy falls in love with her and later when he is in college, he sits in on her trial and she is sentenced to ?????? I won't say much more because it will ruin the movie for others. It is a good movie, good acting, and a good production, but it just wasn't my type of movie. It is a coming of age movie which I usually love but this was too much drama for me. I like the sweet and innocent coming of age stories. I am a sucker for romance but I just felt like she was using this teenage boy who really had fallen in love with her. For the men who say that coming of age stories are chick flicks, this is not one of them. So my advice for all the men is to go see this movie and Kate Winslet will take her clothes off just for you."
4,Important questions raised painfully slowly,It all starts desperately slow and after 45 minutes the plot is nowhere to be found - after exhaustingly slow scenes of undressing and love making between two not bodies that were anything but attractive to the eye. Despite this long and painful start the story truly takes form about an hour into the movie and from then on the excellent acting accelerates and makes for a great experience.The moral questions that are raised subtly rip to the heart and appropriately are not attempted answered leaving the viewer with some serious contemplation afterwards.Approaching 5 stars for the second half but not possible to give more than a small 4 in total in light of the unneccessarily long and painful start.
2,Unbelievable,"A friend recommended this film to me. After hearing him shower it with praises I was convinced it would be the proverbial ""good movie"". I couldn't have been more wrong. If I wanted to sum this film up with one word I think I would choose the word ""vile"". I found nothing of any redeeming value in this self-loathing film that asks the audience to descend into degenerate voyerism in its first half and then suspend all logical thinking in its utterly contrived second half. Stunningly bad."
1,Ultra Smooth Shaver is really Ultra Poor and lumpy,"I am a 20 year user of several Remington products, but I must admit they missed the mark in improving this shaver. The Remington ES-1000 Utra Smooth Bump Control Shaver was designed to replace the original (BMS) Black Man's Shaver which was discountinued several years ago. I recently purchased and used the ES-1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance. The ES-1000 performed so poorly that I had to use my BMS that I had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the ES-1000 shaver could not and did not remove. The product should be called ""Ultra poor with a sandpaper finish."" The product needs to be put to death by using an ultra smooth bullet. For anyone with curly hair problems, you may want to consider comparing this product against the Wahl 5-Star Series, Model # 8061. I think you will find there is a major difference in the products."
4,Works As Designed,"Suffering from razor bumps both on my head and face and due to the fact that I'm in the military, I can appreciate a razor that will limit the amount of bumps I get. The Remington ES-1000 does limit these bumps by shaving at the surface. Due to this fact, you might want to shave two times in the day; once in the morning and again during lunch. Since I'm in the military, this is necessary for me. The shaver in and of itself will not give you a ""smooth like razor"" look. You will need the assistance of an application like Williams Lectric Shave pre-shave splash to get that effect.Other than the frequent shaving, this shaver does limit the number of razor bumps you will get if not eradicate them all over a period of time."
3,"Good, but no cigar!","It was good, but its performance dwindles as time passes by. However, it was not as good as I expected it to be. I wish I could return it."
2,Did not experience razor bump relief,"Razor bumps are very fickle and hard to deal with, so while I can't call this product a complete failure, I have to be fair and say that it did not work as advertised, and sometimes appeared to worsen my condition. As of now, I just use a trimmer for my facial hair, and cut close but not too close."
3,I guess it did okay...,"I ordered this shaver b/c i had shaved with a blad for the first time and my face went crazy with ingrown hairs, razor bumps, etc... So i looked for a shaver that would possibly stop this..I used it for probably two weeks.. and then i let my hair grow back out so I could start back over (which im in the process of doing now).. the first day i used this shaver I was like WOW!! cool.. i like.. reviews say that its not a close shave, but I have to disagree.. Its pretty close.. I can't feel any hairs AT ALL!! Its easy to use... just have to make sure ur face isn't dry... Overall, I say it does everything its suppose to do.. I personally still got the ingrown hairs and a few bumps, but I do have sensitive skin, and I am a black male.. So.. I dont know.. and thats why i gave it a 3."
3,not bad,"A month into training for a marathon, I figured out that I needed a watch to accurately measure distance and pace. I didn't want to break the bank, so I went with this. It came with a GPS receiver that straps to your arm, which I wasn't expecting.After about a month of use, I'm not that impressed. The watch takes about 15 minutes to get a signal, which is about 2-3 miles into a run. The battery case is atrocious - absolutely the worst design, hard to get off, nearly impossible to screw back in. The watch itself is fine, but when you hit the 'indiglo' to read the screen at night, it only stays on for as long as you hold down the button. You can only view two pieces of data at one time, pace and distance, or time. Not all three.But, for a hundred bucks, I'm using it.I'll save up another hundred bucks and definitely go for the Garmin 205 next time. No clunky receiver on the arm, smart display and way better GPS tracking."
3,Dead and Deader,"I love Zombie movies and this one had some kinda new twists on the old theme that I liked,it was unique and worth watching. Not a big budget and a lotta wholes in the plot, but pretty pleasant concept."
4,A hilarious Zome-dy...,"...first of all Dean Cain is a horrible actor, he is so bad in this movie it is hilarious. Well you already know the story (read the amazon description). This movie is hilarious, it is not meant to be a serious zombie flick ala Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" but I highly recommend this one if you are a fan of the zombie genre or horror comedy. A worthy addition to your library."
2,"Why Dean, Why?!","I am a Dean Cain fan so of course I had to check this movie out for myself. While Dean Cain's character is shown throughout the entire movie, the only time I actually get to see the Dean Cain ""acting"" that I feel in love with is not until the last 10 minutes of the movie. The ending of the movie was totally stupid! There are a few dumbass puns in the movie. I don't know who wrote this crap of a movie, but my biggest thought/questions is: Why Dean! Your career started out so well with Superman and while you have had a fewnot so good ""B"" scifi movies, I still had hope, but this movie is the biggest joke of your career. I still like Dean Cain but would defently never want to hear or see of this movie again! Dean, stick to what you are good at, action,...not this crap!Oh and the ""gore"" in this movie is completely ridiculous!!!"
1,Pathetic.,"I seen this movie about a month ago and I really wish I could have that hour and a half of my life back. There was nothing scary, or creepy about this movie."
1,Huh?,"I will first state, to be fair, that I did not finish reading the book because it did not interest me in the least bit. This fellow is a little too far ""out there"" for my tastes! It has very little to do with the ascended masters and very much to do with a fellow named George King, his unique new age ideas and his channelings of Lord Babaji, Lord Buddha, Master Aetherius and Adept Nixies. And I think there is something to do with putting electronic equipment of George King's design on some mountains. Unless one is VERY good channeling, the messages are often tainted with the beliefs of the channeler. I can't help but to believe this is the case with Mr King if he did indeed channel any of this at all. If my vague description intrigues you then go for it and buy the book. If you want to read about ascended masters, keep looking."
4,Hoover WindTunnel V2 WindTunnel Upright Vacuum U8130-900,"I actually like this vacuum. I like the beltless feature. Let's face it they always break or burn, then break. Then you have to flip it over and disassemble the thing! It's not as easy to push as a self-propelled but it isn't hard to push. Cleans carpets very well. As for hard floors, it's okay. But then vacuum cleaners weren't designed for hard floors. They are designed to clean carpets. Buy a broom! Attachments are good, I like that they have a place in the front and secured by the little hatch they are in. Most attachments hook on the back...they always fall off while you vacuum and then the dog picks up the brush and chews it until its completely useless. It's pretty quiet and I like the circuit breaker for the roller bar...Great Idea! The filter is a little expensive however. Hoover, give us a break, Your filter isn't worth $40.00. Otherwise I think its the best I've used."
1,I agree,I was happy with this machine at first but after just a few months the brushes no longer spin and it is so difficult to clean. For the money I was expecting much more!!
1,Stay Away if you have pets,"I went into the store to purchase a new Fantom Fury. None were avaiable and being in desprate need of a vacume I purchased the best Target had available. That was this Hoover WindTunnel. While the suction power is exceptable I found this upright very hard to push and the hose attachments would fall off every time they were bummped. The hose was too short for any type of cleaning,attachments or no attachments. After running it for only one month the brushes no longer move and it needs servicing. For what you pay for this machine it is not worth it. If you have pets, STAY AWAY!"
4,"A few minor bugs, but a good buy","For less than 300 bucks, seems like a good buy. A couple of minor issues:1. Very easy for stuff to get lodged in the clear plastic pipe around the base; very difficult to get it out. It just sits there and taunts you.(HINT: You have to take the base off to get it out, which is not unpleasant; I would recommend the purchase of a good drill driver. I used the 18-volt DeWalt)2. We live in an older home, which we have been remodeling forever (hence the Dewalt). We have a lot of dust, which this vacuum picked up rather easily; however, it did stir it up immensely. The outer shell of the vacuum became as dusty as the inside cup pretty quickly.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the work. I think this is a good buy for the current price."
5,Nice veccum and cheap price.,"If I bought a veccum at some store with that money...I have to change the bag and no hepa filter.also, I got that at home.It's Cheap and comfortable."
1,Worst Vacuum ever!!! Stay away,"I, like others, needed to have the rollers replaced after only 2 months of operation due to a ""design"" flaw. I had them fixed with the ""re-designed steel roller brushes"" and now they are broke again (4 months) later. I am getting a Dyson. Aside from having to clean the debris out of the side vacuum shutes every time I vacuum, It lost most of its suction when I would clean my rugs. I've contacted Hoover to ship this pile of junk back to them. I still haven't heard from them. I am very disappointed. If I could give a negetive rating I would!!!"
2,SURE DOES PICK UP/needs dissasembled & Cleaned every 2nd use,This sweeper sure picks up but I have to tear apart and clean after every 2 uses.We have American eskimo dogs and the hair plugs up the head fast.I wouldn't recommend to pet owners.Also I have to agree that it is made rather cheap for the price .In closing I will say that it is in my opinion it IS NOT A GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY
2,Mine had a melt down.,We bought our Hoover WindTunnel in hope that it would keep up with our Husky's dog fur. The bearing for the brushes melted making it a useless hunk of plastic. Did not get my moeny out of it at all. Very disapointed.
4,Great Substitute for a Dyson,I couldnt see spending the money on a Dyson. I have used both and this is a fine alternative to spending hundreds of dollars more for the Dyson. We hav ehtis and a Dirt Devil Bagelss and this is a much better machine.Light enough for my wife to carry up and down the stiars and the on-board tool storage is the BEST I have ever seen. With a closed lid over the tools they never fall out or get lost. Worth twice the price.Highly Reccomend
2,not worth the money,"I bought this sweeper a couple of months ago and I have to say that it's not worth the high price tag. At first it worked really great and I was excited that there was finally a sweeper that could pick up my german shepard's hair! My excitement quickly turned to disappointment after about the fourth time using it. The plastic clip that holds the vacuum in the upright position busted off, meaning it kept slamming down on the floor when you tried to use the attachments, hitting me in the head and back! The brush roller switch button also broke! The rollers got clogged up with carpet fibers and dog hair, and the clear plastic suction area is impossible to clean!!! I was pretty gentle with it, it shouldn't have busted that easily! The bagless feature wasn't great, very dusty! I am returning this piece of junk for another vacuum!!!! Don't buy this!"
1,Not worth it,We have had our Hoover for almost a year and have had nothing but problems. When the headlight went out the first time we used it I should of taken it as a sign and returned it. Every time I unconnected the hose to use the tools dirt and dust came out. The hose doesn't reach as far as other models do and when you pull too much it comes undone from the vacuum. It is louder than other vacuums and a little heavier. It clogs daily. The filter gets dirty quick and rotating it doesn't do a good job of removing the dirt. A new filter is $30. The brushes CANNOT handle hair at all. Every time we used this vacuum we had to spend just as much time unclogging it and cutting the hair off the brushes. Just today the vacuum finally gave up and broke. It emitted this awful smell and died. Called the service center but who can go without a vacuum for a few weeks? We ended buying a Dyson and are keeping our fingers crossed. What an expensive lesson.
1,Poorly designed,"I bought one of these at Sams and sure wish I had read these reviews before I bought it. I had the same problem that has been mentioned several times before in these reviews. After about six months the steel shafts that turn the agitator brushes stripped out the soft plastic bearings that they sit in, so that they no longer turn the brushes. This makes the vacuum essentially useless for cleaning carpeting."
2,Will not pick up fine hair on berber carpet.,"I've given up. During the second use of the first one I bought, the brushes stopped working and judging from the smell, it seems the brush motor burned out. I returned it and exchanged it for a second vacuum of the same model. During the first use of that vacuum, the familiar burning smell permeated the air. I returned it too.The vacuum has great suction. However, if you have pets with fine hair, the vacuum will just push it around on berber carpet. It seems to pick it up okay on regular plush carpet. I had to use the hose to pick up the lines of hair left on the berber. Overall, I'm not pleased considering the relatively hefty price tag."
1,this is the worst vacuum for long term use,"I've had my vacuum less than 7 mos. Just long enough that the company won't let me have my money back. Where should I start? The components get clogged, the belts break and the brush warps. I've had it repaired under warranty for free and I just got it home and the belt melted because it sucked up a piece of shoe string! I paid 329 dollars for this piece of plastic. I've had my electrolux for 20 yrs and recently thought it would be nice to get a new vacuum. Boy was I wrong! Save your money and the hassle of extended warranties in order to keep this piece of junk running. The extended warranty is another 60 bucks plus every time you take it in you're left with no vacuum. It's an illusion because it has a strong motor but everything it's made of is plastic so the parts break."
1,Quite possibly the worst vacuum ever made.,This machine burned up several belts in a period of one month. The filter clogs regularly to a point where you have to keep checking the suction to see if it's actually working. When it does clog you have to thrash it into a bag creating a cloud of dust. Caveat Emptor!! But Hoover should be ashamed to ever let this product out on the market.
1,Nothing but problems and very poor support from Hoover,"We bought this vaccum about 6 months ago. It has been at the hoover store almost as much as it has been here being used. Some of the problems were the brushes throwing out clumps of bristles, Getting hopelessly cloged after one or two uses. A burned out brush motor/gearbox with melted plastic parts. The Hoover store repair person advised me that we should not have gopt this model since we have a long haired dog. We had a sears kenmore that worked for many years with our dogs and never burned out or cloged up. In general this unit is over priced and poorly designed and built. I remember when the name Hoover stood for a high quality product. This no longer seems to be the case."
1,Not the Best Vacuum,"Well, when we first brought this vacuum home I was very excited. I loved the design and thought the concept of the V technology was impressive. When I first used this vacuum, it cleaned wonderfully, but the more it was used the worse it got. I bought this Vacuum at Sam's Club, and had to return it 2 weeks later. This Vacuum was very poorly built. It has plastic parts. And when something gets clogged you they melt the parts very fast, the brush on this vacuum stopped turning. This was truly a waste of money!!!"
3,Good But Could Be Better,"This vacuum has great pick up power but hard to push around. I was disapointed with the accessories. It came with only one extension wand instead of two that previous models had so it is difficult to clean under beds. I salvaged a wand from my previous cleaner. It came with two crevice tools, a short one and a longer one. I thought the short one was unnecessary. Also there was no powered hand tool as it said in the manual. I salvaged this from an earlier model. I like the fact that there are no belts to change. If this model does not give me good service I will not purchase another Hoover."
1,Avoid like the plague,"Easily the worst household buy we have ever made. The agitator brushes have stripped twice in a year; the mounts are flimsy. It constantly clogs, which requires time-consuming diassembly of the back of the vacuum. In terms of cleaning, it is no better than average--the $60 Eureka it replaced was about as good.Don't throw your money away!"
3,Extigy Pros and Cons,"Overall, this is a very nice external sound module. I was disapointed with some of the driver support under Windows 2000. It took a bit of prodding to actually get it running and tech support was not terribly helpful. It sounds good with a noise floor lower than I had expected. I wish it suppored coax SPDIF in and out, and that is my biggest complaint, really. This has got to be one of the best modules for laptops and people on the go. For a home pc or workstation, I personally prefer the Sound Blaster Live! with its digital daughter-board."
2,Some definite glitches,"Cons: The price is dropping on this thing weekly. I'm using it on an brand-spanking-new Thinkpad under XP, and recording is a buggy disaster (among other things). CreativeLabs hasn't been timely in their responses to bug reports, so it's unclear if the hw is broken or not. Even if it's not, untimely response to real support requests isn't encouraging. I'm actually trying to use the product for real things. The software bundle is definitely light for the current price (notably, lack of a DVD player).Pros: There are many high end products which use USB. Yes, I would love it if they all used firewire, but precious few seem to. 24/96 is real, and extigy's price is cheap compared to certain other offerings (unfortunately, there may be a real reason why the price is less - see above).Over time extigy might be a real contender."
1,"Doesn't do all it says, tech support nonexistent","The Creative SoundBlaster Extigy comes with an impressive array of analog and digital inputs. Reviews and ads all claim that it can be used as an external sound card and an amp for video game consoles and DVD players. I've tried many DVDs on my Playstation 2 with the Extigy, and none of them will play through all audio channels (speakers). Perhaps there is a simple fix or workaround; I emailed their tech support months ago, but there has been no reply."
2,The Exitgy is okay,I bought the extigy to take the place of my laptop sound chip. I bought it with a set of promedia 4.1s. So far it works like advertised. The only problem is the very poor quality when using the cmss. It greatly reduces the power and quality it even makes the klipsch speakers sound bad. Updating the drivers helped some but not enough. Only get the extigy if you have to (broken laptop sound chip.)
4,Sound Blaster Extigy is Very Nice but Tech Support is Poor,"I bought my Sound Blaster Extigy because of the price, but the USB features since I ran out of PCI slot. I was surprised that Sound Blaster Extigy is EXTREMELY easy to install. Just turn the sound card on and plug the USB cable to the computer and install the driver. I did it without any problem.Another cool feature of extigy is, the card is external so I don't have to crawl to the back of my computer and try to switch the jacks. I use The Logitech 4.1 THX speakers and The speakers produce the most awesome 3D sound when I watch Jurasic Park III, it seems like the dinasours were in the living room.Creative Labs unfortunately has bad reputation of having the slowest customer service. I wish they will improve it in the future, since they are no.1 sound card company.Overall, I recommend this external sound card. The price is right and the quality is very nice."
3,Good sound bad seller,I bought this soundcard too use a pc headset on my ps3 and have true 5.1 surround sound. Well it works but I received the card with the wrong power adapter so I had too spend [...] bucks for a new one on top of the 70 for the card. There is a short in front sound port I get little noise then wiggle it and it pops then I get the full sound. Overall good product would be great but alot of trouble with this one.
1,False advertising. Limited software. Poor performance.,"Don't let the ads or products specs fool you. This sound card does not live up to what it promises. USB bandwith does not allow the Extigy to live up to the Creative standard of its other product lines. While you gain ease of installation and a remote, you lose all software, EAX HD (it claims to support it, but in fact does not) and other features. This product hogs CPU usage because it requires the computer to do most of the processing due to USB limitations. When your computer is doing many things at once, audio quality suffers. It claims to support S/PDIF in but in fact only supports it as a standalone. Any digital signal passed to the Extigy is converted to analog before being transferred to the computer resulting in a significant loss of quality and the impossibility of actual digital recording. I am completely disatisfied with every aspect of this product and am subsequently returning it."
1,Inoperative when received,Fortunately for Amazon's good return policy I was able to return this unit. I hooked it up to an XP computer by the USB port. When I turned it on there was no output at the speaker jacks. The audio gain control was also faulty. My computer met all the necessary requirements and the Extigy software was installed properly. This unit looked like just the system I was looking for but I am sorely disappointed that the quality control people let this unit go in the condition it was in.
4,Good but could be better,I love the extigy it was easy to set up/install and works great and sounds great with my computer. I just wish they would hurry up and come out with a USB 2.0 version to utilize the higher bandwith. If you can get by using the internal version Audigy then I would recomend that other wise the extigy rocks.
1,Rolled The Dice And Took My Chances,"Before buying an Extigy I read the reviews on this and other sites. The consensus was that people either love this device or hate it. Hoping that I would be one of the lucky ones, I boughtone from CompUSA. Following the installation my screen turned a hazy green - like looking at the monitor through an old Coke bottle. As I tried to open applications like the Creative Recorder, I found that the files I had loaded from the CD were corrupt. There were no downloads to fix any of the problems I encounted. I exchanged it at CompUSA for another one. I got the same green screeen on both my IMB and Dell laptops. The second installation CD had many of the same corrupt files.It's going back this afternoon and I'll start looking for a different product.Good luck if you buy one of these - and keep your receipts!"
1,problems with midi in extigy.help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought recently Extigy USB card, and I have a huge problem with midi. When I connect my midi controler trough this card, the midi recording is totally wrong. It changes rytms and records wrong music notes...does anybody know what`s wrong. Is it card, WinXP or maybe some settings?"
1,More trouble than it's worth,This thing has done nothing but cause trouble on my PC. It does not work properly with Windows XP even with the updates from Creative Labs.It has totaly caused havok with all of my drivers. I removed the software for the Extigy and all is back to normal now. Hmmm.These problems were not because of my installation as I had 2 other persons give it a try also. Both of them Computer Techs.Save your money! Buy anther Brand!
3,Gotta have if you're an 80's fan!,"Got a good mix of old favorites (Relax, Cruel Summer) and some not-so-easy-to-find gems like Whisper To A Scream. I love this cd!"
2,"a few gems, a lot of debris","this volume, just like every other in the series is long on promise and short on proof. there are better compilation sets out there and they're not hard to find. the obscure references to some groups is so obscure that they had to search hard and wide to fill the empty spots where good songs should have gone. it blows my mind to think that an 80's compilation would be an undertaking of monumental failure, but Just Can't Get Enough of the 80's Volumes 1 through 15 does just that. there are a lot of good songs but far too many that should never make a compilation of any kind."
1,White Rose of Scotlalnd,"This was one of the most disappointing books I have ordered about ScotlandInstead of descriptions of Island living [one or two incidents beautifully included], it was, in the main, a despription of frustrated sex,immature fantasies, and long, overdone page after page of not quite having sex. I bought the ""Westering Home"" also, and will probably not even read it."
1,MIDNIGHT MUSH,"Shame on F. Paul Wilson for being involved with this mindless, garbage-level trash. No redeeming qualities..steer away from it....don't let the ""vampire"" plot lure you...this looks like a movie made by a bunch of drunks on less than shoestring budget.Yuck!"
1,why???? please tell me why?,"after viewing this, i wished for the days of public stoning to be brought back. and everyone connected to this abomination to be truly held accountable for the waste of resources the performed.worst yet, they are from my state, i have a feeling these were the same gothic wanna be's that congregated for years inthe Barnes & Noble coffee shop of Bricktown. All talking about making a vampire film... GOD HELP US, THEY HAVE!!!! (the apocalypse is nopt far behind)"
1,dont waste your time..................................,"Like i said dont waste your time or money.First of all,this movie goes no where.the story line is bad and the acking is even worse.This is one of the most stupid movies i have ever seen.Please take it from me.Do not buy this,dont even rent it.And if you do,dont say i didnt warn u."
1,Quite possibly the worst product in the history of human civilization,What's up with F. Paul Wilson and bad directors/actors? It seems like the man is cursed when it comes to getting a decent movie treatment of his excellent novels. First with The Keep (which was at least watchable) and then with Midnight Mass. This Midnight Mass movie is an utter abomination. What a waste of a good novel. What a waste of money and of everyone's time.
3,Blood Sucking Ghouls!,"This blasphemous film features a confrontation between an atheist anarchist, a renegade priest, and a whole host of blood sucking ghouls - otherwise known as vampires. Apparently an epidemic has broken out across the earth and resulted in mass death. At first it is attributed to some rare plague, but sooner or later the truth comes out - it's an epidemic of vampirism. In order to keep the population down, the vampires are forced to enlist the help of rogue humans known as the ""Vichy"". The movie tries hard to create the impression that the vampires are a Nazi occupation force while the anarchist and the priest and the band of human rebels are freedom fighters. This movie features a satanic mass, a real mass, and two gory scenes showing a pack of these ghouls eating people (really nasty too). At the end the atheist sees the light and converts after witnessing the powers of Christ against these vile creatures of darkness."
1,The worst film I have ever seen,"I am not being overly dramatic when I say this is the worst movie I have ever laid my eyes on. In fact I do not even consider it a movie, but instead a student project that somehow got on DVD. ANYONE who tells you they enjoyed this movie either worked on it or was under the influence of some psychotropic drug.I rented this at blockbuster and almost felt the need to go back and destroy every copy on the shelves as a public service. I hate this movie so much I am currently trying to contact the people that made it to tell them how much I hate the movie and them.PLEASE, PLEASE do not rent or buy this DVD. The only reason to watch this DVD is if you hate yourself. Trust me when I say even if you hate yourself, you don't deserve this."
3,Mostly nostalgia.,"I watched this movie with my son because I remembered seeing it when I was young and loving it. He enjoyed it, and it reinforced the idea to me that most of the things that you watched as a kid are better left as good memories. Most of the time, they are not nearly as good as you remember them."
2,Item not as listed,"THIS REVIEW IS NOT BASED ON THE PRODUCT, but on my understanding of Amazon.com return policies. This is my first time making a purchase on Amazon.com., and I'd been looking for a particular old song title by this artist for quite some time. When I did a search on Amazon.com this item came up. I was so excited to receive the item, but much to my disappointment the song for which I purchased this item wasn't on the cassette. While the album is probably very good, it is not what I expected, so I have not and probably will not listen to it. I would have returned the cassette, but from my understanding of Amazon.com's return policy, I could not return the item because I opened it. SILLY Me...In my haste & excitement I guess I neglected to read the fine print."
2,Niceness obscured by obnixous noises...,"Ru Tenone and Glangorous are definately the two reasons to pick this up if you are a Stereolab fan. The rest of it is basically the sound of Stereolab mambers going overboard with ""percolation"" noises. The sad part is that if you listen closely, underneath all those quirky, bubbley noises lies some actually nice Stereolab stuff... One can only hope that it could get a serious remix (except the above mentioned tracks) and then re-issued someday on another b-sides, etc. compilation. But a VERY long shot I think that will be."
5,Electronic Pop Muzak,"I like this EP a lot. The songs are short, each one playing out a simple melody or idea before moving on to the next one, but the record flows together nicely. The music is both playful and trippy, perfect for background music at your next Tupperware party."
2,Definitive??? Ouch!!!,"With great expectation I looked forward to getting Mr. Shaffer's book, especially after reading a great review of it in the now defunct section of the LA Times called Outdoors...once in my possession, I would be among the cognoscenti of southern California's natural wonders...but alas it is not to be...First, I looked for the 80' three tiered Fish Canyon falls just above Duarte in the San Gabriel's...nothing was to be found...this is one of the most famous and beautiful falls in all of the San Gabriel's...a simple call to any, and I mean ANY ranger the area could have named it...no, nothing...Next, I looked for the well known but unnamed falls just off the Middle fork of Lytle Creek, three actually that include drops between 60' and 80' respectively...again nothing, not one word...both of these spectacular and beautiful falls can be seen in all their grandeur on the NET and at numerous sites...Definitive, hardly...two stars and only because of its beautiful layout..."
1,What a disappointment...,"This book is ridiculous. What the author calls a waterfall is often just a tiny drip of water... I am an avid hiker and backpacker and don't mind an extremely strenuous day in the outdoors, but if I'm heading out to see a waterfall, I want a real pay-off. After using this book a couple times and quickly realizing it was just some sort of ego trip for the author, I went out and bought Ann Marie Brown's ""California Waterfalls"" published by Foghorn Outdoors. This is a far superior book, written by someone who really knows how to write a guide book and gives the reader a great experience on the trail. If you truly want to see waterfalls, don't waste your money on Shaffer's book. The only thing it has going for it is color pictures. Buy Brown's book instead. It costs less money and it is a far superior guide!"
1,Pathetic waste of money,"I already owned a copy of Ann Marie Brown's book, ""California Waterfalls"", so I thought I would buy this book to see if there were other falls in it. Total waste of money. It looks as if the author bought Brown's book and simply visited all the waterfalls that she described, then added a few more really lame ones that are totally not worth the effort to get to... Not only that but his photographs are terrible, his directions will get you hopelessly lost, and he doesn't mention any information on flora, fauna, geology, or anything else interesting. Stick with Brown's book. It costs less money and it's far more informative."
1,Disappointing and Frustrating,"I bought this book with the expectation that it might help me find waterfalls missing from the Ann Marie Brown book.And while Shaffer listed many waterfalls not in her book, you'll find that the vast majority of them marginally count as ""waterfalls"". Moreover, his directions were frustrating to follow and were simply not worth the trouble when you're out spending your valuable free time trying to enjoy the outdoors. The fact it doesn't have useful maps didn't help matters either.When compared to the experience of using Ann Marie Brown's book, this book doesn't even come close to being anywhere near as useful as Brown's.While I do appreciate the color and the plethora of photos (so you at least know what the falls look like), the lack of quality (e.g. blurry photos), poor directions (e.g. Salmon Creek Falls north of Kernville), lack of maps, and incomplete chapters (e.g. the Waterwheel Falls chapter) make this a book difficult to recommend."
1,Not what it claims to be,"I bought this book a month ago and have tried to go to three of the waterfall destinations featured. The directions were wrong to two of them (I lost about an hour at one, just driving around trying to find the trailhead). The third one, when I finally reached it, was not exactly what I would call a waterfall. I think this writer needs some lessons in how to write a guidebook. The book appears to be self-published (it's full of photographs of the author's friends, the layout is so garish it looks like it was done by a third-grader, and it is loaded with misspellings and bad punctuation). I read somewhere that this was supposed to be a ""coffee-table"" style guidebook... what a laugh. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Definitive Guide To Waterfalls,"I found this to be an excellent, well written book.The book is exactly what it claims to be--A definitive comprehensive guide.The book is in color and the waterfall pictures make you want to get in your car and drive to Yosemite or your nearest waterfall today!!!I am anxiously awaiting the author's Definitive Guide to Northern California book to come out--if it were available today I would be the first to purchase it!"
5,What a great book!,"Reading Shaffer's book I truly felt like I was on the path with him feeling the mist coming off the giant waterfalls in Yosemite National Park. He has done an outstanding job writing the book and I commend him for that. This is the only book I've ever seen that has first hand knowledge about the waterfalls and the trails, plus pro quality color photos. This book is a must have for anyone looking to hike in California."
5,The Definitive Guide to the Waterfalls,"What an great book. I bought this book at Border's in the spring and love it. I take my family and kids to waterfalls all over Southern California that I never knew existed. Shaffer has done a great job. Good photos, trail explanations and good directions. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to hike."
3,Hospital class found the voice a problem,"We showed this to a group of new moms. They liked it, and particularly liked the baby shots, thought it was a great idea. One of the Moms (OK, she's a trained radio announcer,) found fault with the voice tone, and once she started in the other moms made similar comments. We ended up going back to a demo class without video, but let's face it, not everybody can get to a class. Buy this, because you ought to massage your baby."
2,"Sketchy and sloppy for a ""Developer's Guide""","Sloppiness is commonplace in computer books these days in part due to the haste with which this material is being published, but when a 21-chapter book refers the reader to chapter 24 for further details concerning an important subject (see page 617), it crosses the line."
4,Great Book for everyone,"Internet Explorer 5 Developer's Guide/ In reviewing this book, I think it is does a good job of explaining the object model, and how to script. It isn't really for advanced programmers ,I think it is more for ""advancing""programmers and everyone who wants to learn more about object programming. The author does a good job of explaining some complex concepts in a concise manor.M Keeley Page Graphics/Chicago Il."
5,Best guide to find doorman-elevater buildings (no broker fees),"This guide can really save you the realtor's fees *IF* you are looking for ""big"" building (i.e. it does not list brownstone buildings...). It lists most, if not all, big buildings in Manhattan (subdivided by neighborhood), Brooklyn, Bronx, Queen, and nearby-NJ. It lists mostly doorman-elevator buildings, but there is a smaller section with non-dorman/elevator buildings.On a tipical page there are two buildings. Each has: the address, a picture of the exterior, the contact information of the management (no fee). It lists what type of units are available, the price range for each of them, feautres (Consierge, Elevator, Dishwasher, PetPolicy and much more).**This guide is updated every year and I strongly advice to get the new one each year, becuase prices (and even new construction!!) happen so often in NYC."
2,Why was this book written?,"If anybody is going to read this book let me save you time. Go and read Posner's ""Case Closed"" or the ""Warren Commission Report"" because this is all the book is. While the book is easy reading, the author does not look at the evidence. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see that the shooting of Kennedy could not have been done by one person. Canal disregards witness testimony's that claim they heard shots from other locations than the TSBD. Read the ""Warren Report"" it's better than this book, which doesn't say much."
1,Another Oswald-did-it book that no one will believe,"John Canal seems like a nice guy; then again, so does O.J. This book is in the same realm as Posner-Belin-Moore-Mailer: LHO did it all alone. Yawn. Bugliosi is soon to follow (soon=years away)...Vince Palamara"
3,"Will The Real ""One Night In Bangkok ""Please Stand Up","Finally, one can have the original version of ""One Night In Bangkok"" on Volume 14 of this series. Murray Head wasn't smart enough to include it on his own greatest hits CD, so it's good that someone got it right. In addition, some other worthy offerings on this CD include ""Close (to the edit) by Art Of Noise, Der Komimissar (After The Fire), ""Imagination"" by Belouis Some, and ""Sunglasses At Night"" by Corey Heart.""True Men Don't Kill Coyotes"" is an interesting inclusion as we get to hear the Red Hot Chili Peppers in their underground days. This is worth having if you're an 80's fan. Go get yourself a copy."
3,just adding to a collection.,"Some of the songs I knew very well, others not so much. Just had to have it for the collection"
5,Yummy!,"Our neighbor loaned us a copy of this cookbook so my wife could see if there was some recipes and she was going to copy any she found we might like onto her recipe cards. About halfway through the book she had a huge list of recipes she wanted, so I ordered the book for her instead.Good stuff that, mostly, uses food items we already buy."
4,Better then expected!,"Ok, so a $100 boombox for satellite radio isn't as good as your home system, but for what it is--a portable boombox, it does quite nicely. I do not agree with the comment here by another user that its sound quality isn't as good as FM. Perhaps he wasn't using the antenna properly...because it sounds MUCH better then FM quality both for the Satellite and for the line in. It is not a light sucker, so expect some weight but I think that speaks to how solid the boombox is. I gave it four stars due to the fact that it could be lower weight, more options (FM/AM tuner) and perhaps less expensive. If you have a Sportster and want portability, pick one up."
4,Not Loud Enough,"OK boom box. I agree with other reviews - not loud enough! However, a solution to the low volume problem when using your satellite reciever is to place another (ie louder) boom box near it. The wireless fm signal from the Sportster tuner will transmit to the next box. I have not used it with batteries yet, nor the aux input."
1,Garbage,"Don't buy this unless you plan on taking it to the beach - it is useless for the house. As the other reviews pointed out - the antenna only works outside - 20 feet from your home. So plan on purchasing a seperate roof antenna and at least 50 feet of extra cable, and then get ready to spend an entire day installing it, or add the cost of hiring an electrian to do it for you. Oh yea, it stopped working completely after 3 months from unconnecting and reconnecting the antenna as you take it from room to room."
1,what a terrable sound system,"this thing straight up sucks, i got it for christmas as one of my gifts and guess what i dont have sirius reception in my house ,and they want you to put the antenna near the window, what kinda of boom box do you have that has to sit next to a window or it wont work, needless to say this didn't work for me, so unless you live on top of a mountain dont buy this crap it is a piece and should not be sold"
4,Atmospheric sounds for humans,"A very light atmospheric album in the vein of late Burzum and Vond. If any of you know about the relation between Pink Floyd's ""Dark side of the moon"" and The wizard of Oz, Fritz Lang's 1924 silent film ""Metropolis"" goes perfectly with this album somehow. Just start the album as soon as the movie actually begins and you will hear the story unfold while watching it. Strange, but true."
5,dark noise for a bright future,"This is one of those records I meant to buy for years and finally did. And when I at last put it on my turntable, I was completely floored by it's complexity and vision. A relentless rollercoaster of an album that keeps you flipping those sides in and out of order. This was my introduction to the manifesto and I was swept off my feet. I resolved then and there to seek out all other works by these maniacs of music. They do things with sound and rhythm that I sit and dream about wondering where I can find such imagined music. Well, here it be!Incidentally, this record was brillant enough to send me searching for it on the web and to write a few lies of gaga fandom, my first cyberspace review. Buy it today before someone else does!"
3,NOT an awesome album by any means,"Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good, but it sounds more like a DJ mix CD than an original album. I realize all of MBM's stuff is usually sampled, and they're probably my favorite band, but this is not for everyone. It's redundant and the tracks go on forever. Perhaps good at a party where the beat is all that matters, but listening to it at home, you think after about 5 minutes ""this is getting old, i'm gonna put on some FSOL or Cabaret Voltaire"" you know? Still a good CD, but probably only for MBM completists."
3,Noise & Paradox - Transmograpfication,"On fierce drum 'n' bass on this collaboration from Noise and Paradox. The rhythms come strong and dark, as apparent from the opening track, ""Descending Azzizzium."" But while the drumwork is flawless, at times it seems that that's all they have going for them. On top of the rhythm are some ambient sounds -- some snatches of sound, some EQ sweeps, some scratching, but not much more. And that seems to weaken the songs overall. ""Soundtrack for the 10th Planet"" has some thick atmosphere on it, but the song development is a little lacking; same goes for ""Last Night on Earth"": creepy mood, then repeat. ""Dimension No. 9"" kicks up the rhythmic interest, while the title track hums like a beehive. And the final track, ""Just Begun,"" shifts things into more of a hip-hop mode, though the dark ambient sounds reappear nonetheless. Rhythmically inventive, definitely, but I'd like some melodic invention to go along with it as well."
3,Average,"This book offers a lot of good advice and a lot of words to remember. It also offers a some good things that some other books don't talk about. It's not quite 100% my method on learning the language, but I can still follow it. The only downside I can think of for this book is that it has absolutely no Hiragana, Katakana, or Kanji; It is all Romaji, which I think is a vital missing link."
2,Almost a Complete Waist of Time,"When I brought this book, I did not know there was not any Japanese in it.If you want to learn Japanese, this book is not for you. It does not have one scrap of actual Japanese in it. It has Romaji, which is a Romanized version of Japanese. It may seem that it is easier to learn Japanese using this method, but it will hinder you in the future. Romaji is a necessary tool to transition from English to Japanese, but it would be smarter to only use the Romaji to learn kana. Once you learn kana, you can start learning kanji.My final verdict: skip Romaji and skip this book."
4,Kono hon wa...kekko desu 'n ga... Demo...Pimsleur ja arimasen yo.,"As any reference, it does not take the place of Pimsleur, Berlitz or other, more formalized programs whereby the student actually speaks in Nihongo. (Speaking it is the only way to really learn the language.) But you can think of Sato-sensei's text as a good primer and a convenient reference - especially for distinguishing between the formal and more colloquial forms of Kanto-region Japanese. Sensei has also included some helpful tables of the different verb forms, and the inside cover tables with the particles and copulas are a major plus. Consider it a starter's guide to the language and a companion to the more formalized courses. Should work for students at university level as well."
3,Dislike,I did not enjoy the condition this product was in. It did not come with the audio CD like it said it was. I am not happy with what I got for the price of this book.
2,Boaring,The same dry style of teaching a launguage that has been around since before the 8 track.You listen to a word in English and then repeat it in Japanese. If you just wat to leard to count to 10 and say hello and good bye then this is what you want.Anything more indepth look elsewhere.
1,Japanese for Dummies doesn't live up to other Dummies books.,"If you are serious about learning Japanese, stay away from this book. First, it only uses ""romanji"", which is rarely used by Japanese people. You can learn the basic Japanese alphabets with a few weeks daily study. What would you think of someone studying English using only Japanese letters? It doesnt make much sense. Romaji should be used to ease you in to the Japanese alphabet, not substitute it. This book encourages that bad habit. Second, it has no concept of ""level appropriate"" and throws out all kinds of idiosyncratic vocab. You are learning the word for ""fresh shrimp"" before going over elemtary vocab. I live in Japan, and I quickly discarded this book as soon as I discovered alternatives which actually help you learn Japanese and understand Japanese culture (like the book ""Genki"")."
5,This is a simple book,"The biggest problem people have found with this book is that it has no Japanese characters in it. I was fortunate enough to preview the book in a bookstore before deciding to purchase it. On the first page inside the book, it says that the purpose of the book is to teach phrases and grammar and purpose and will not contain 1 Japanese symbol.This book is definitely useful if you are wanting to learn conversational Japanese because even though it doesn't teach you how to write it, you have a start in at least understanding what is said.I definitely recommend this book."
4,Japanese for Dummies,This is a well written and easy to understand book accompanied by an invaluable CD. It is so helpful even my 7 year of nephew is now very quickly learning the language. We are soon travelling to Japan and know that having had the benefit of this book we have a good chance of understanding the language whereas before we would have been lost in translation. Cant wait to try it out.
5,The Better Buy,"I remember buying this book when it first came out back in 2002, and used it in Sato Sensei's JPN111 class. The book is written in a way to be used by people,who are just learning the language for the purpose of communication with others in a hurry. Unlike the course books she writes for her classes at this college,the Dummies/Idiot's Language series are kinda like the 10 min. a day language books, or the learning a language for busy business people series. This book is meant for the very beginner student, and not for someone who is a higher level Japanse student who already knows hiragana, katakana, kanji, and conjugation. I can assure you that the Idiot's Conversational Japanese is no different than it's Dummies version. You can buy both books,but Sato Sensei's book is a better buy."
4,Very Helpful,"I am constantly dabbling in the idea of getting myself a sporty car that I can have some fun with but like most of us, I don't happen to have a large disposable income to blow on the hot new Ferrari 575. That is why this book is most fabulous for even the most fund-deficient of car enthusiasts that just want to have a pedal stomping, gear shifting good time.There is a large collection of moderately priced sports cars that have been rated for various attributes. Each car has a few pages dedicated to the pros, cons and specs of the car, along with pictures and some history behind the car. I felt that this book covered a very nice variety of domestic and imported sports cars and offered almost all the basic information anyone would want in narrowing down their search for a new toy. I still haven't gotten myself a car yet, but that doesn't stop me from dreaming."
2,Needs Updating Badly,"Most of the reviews read like a casual fan of sports cars from the 1980s. While there is some decent technical data there is not enough background on the cars nor is there enough technical data provided. The title dates the book as many of these cars can be bought and restored for significantly less than $20,000 now. However, it is a nice global review of all the cars you probably forgot about. Worth about $15 in my book."
4,Nice Nuggets of Information,Max Freedom Long has found truely effective methods for creating your own reality (working magick). I find that like most of his work there are nuggets of very valuable information in Growing Into Light.
5,May I Recommend a Fine Cabernet Sauvignon with Your Carp?,"This CD goes well with most fine wines and Miller beer products. Though there may be too much musical diversity for fans of ""cookie-cutter alternative"" or ""fake country"" this one works for me. But then again, I have a lust for life, liberty and the pursuit of catching a buzz.I love independent bands like Carp 18 who take their well written, diverse tunes and crank through them in a garage-rock fashion disregarding any attempt at producing a ""so slick, how does the music stick to the CD"" CD.It's a cool mix of folk, punk, country, power pop and ""wah-wah pedal rock"" that just seems to work. In a nutshell I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the loose approach of Neil Young & Crazy Horse, the Uncle Tupelo/Son Volt/Wilco thing, Slobberbone, Old 97's etc.I gotta run!Gather T."
4,enjoyable,"my 7-year-old enjoyed this book, she loves the series and we will probably get more of the series on line."
4,"Junie B., First Grader One-Man Band","Barbara Park's Junie B. Jones Books have been loved by children for years. Her new series has Junie B. in first grade. Now fifth in the series is Junie B., First Grader One-Man Band.We find Junie B. back in room one with her teacher Mr. Scary. The class has a kick ball tournament and she dreams of becoming the star player until she injures her piggie toe during practice.She is devastated but her parents teach her that llife has disappointments and she can turn lemons into lemonaide.I give the book a four star rating. My daughters and I enjoyed it. Barbara Park's characters are realistic and the story is easy reading and a lot of fun."
1,What a terrible example,"When I first discovered the Junie B Jones series, I thought it was a great set of books for my daughter to read. Then I really sat down with her when she was reading them, and the books are AWFUL. The grammar and word choices are a terrible example for a child to be exposed to when reading. I understand that the books are an accurate example of how a kindergartener and a first grader may speak, but I prefer my children hear and read the correct use of words as an example of how speak. We switched to Beverly Cleary classics which are just as entertaining and grammatically correct."

5,Chevy Emblem,This item looks good on both sides of my 2012 Chevy Equinox which is bare and no trace that it is a Chevy besides the spinning hub caps on the rims.
5,Nice decals,I like these decals. Very sharp and durable. Placed on doors above door handles to give K2500 a bit different look.
4,"Quiet, powerful family drama","Life for a father (Bob Burrus) and his two sons (Anson Mount and Glenn Fitzgerald) on their Nebraska farm is disrupted by an unexpected foreclosure notice that causes the opening of family secrets concerning the absent mother. This quiet but powerful drama has a deliberate pace that matches the long, slow summer days and nights of a rural community. Deceptively uneventful on the surface, the film seethes with repressed emotion underneath, and the end is heartbreaking. A cast of unknowns make these honest, hard-working characters into people that you could expect to meet on the street."
2,Better Luck Next Time,"This indie movie about two brothers in a rural landscape has a couple of interesting elements (competent acting, solid direction, worthwhile characters) but ultimately it suffers from an average and rushed plot that doesn`t make this cinematic experience work all that well. I still think that Hilary Birmingham is a director to watch, since her first film is still a decent and meritory effort, yet one hopes that her next work will show a bit more energy and courage.Worth watching but doesn`t rise above average."
2,Sure didn't work for me...,"My wife brought this home from the video store on a whim after hearing on TV that Roger Ebert liked it. To each of us, however, this was boring and slow and slow and boring. An arty film in which every single camera shot or scene seems to last too long. One of the sons has sex twice with a trampy but pretty girl, and twice with a nice but less attractive partner. No steamy love on screen, however. We join them only when the action is over, and most clothes are back on. This is the kind of script that could have benefitted from nudity and sexual content. It is a downer, and for some movie fans, any film that's not a downer isn't really ""art."" If you are like that, perhaps you will like this. I think the director may have some talent but needs a better sense of pace and action."
5,Great indie film,"The slow pacing is a good match for the rural, quiet lifestyle. Characters are complex, interesting, likeable and believable. Especially enjoyed Julianne Nicholson's portrayal of Ella Smalley, a kind, honest young woman bringing some life to the lonely family dynamic of a single father raising two sons. The theme is bittersweet with a touch of hopefullness. Recommended."
5,a bit choppy but still an excellent drop,"Yesterday I puchased a DVD copy of one of the best progressive surf flixz ever made from my local surf shop: ""Momentum I and II"" and I knew that I would get my money's worth because ""Momentum..."" keeps it real. I came across this movie and thought ""another corny surf film about posers and grommets"". I rented it first and upon viewing it, I enjoyed so much, I went out and bought it! Though it may not please the hard-core surf film enthusiast where all that is wanted is frame after frame of surf godz shredding with 3 chord punk rock on the soundtrack, this little surprise has a very good storyboard and surprisingly some really tight frames of wave action. It has a story that not only gravitates around a surf theme, but has emotion that those who may have had heartbreak at home can reflect on. If I want to see some good surf action along with a story that leaves me appreciating family and friends, this little gem gets the ticket."
5,local boys,locals boys is my FAVORITE movie in all time!I LOVE the surfing part because i am a surfer. ANd i love all of the characters. Well most of them. I think this movie was wonderful and entertaining. It made me cry like 6 times in this movie because of all the other people crying. it was a very good and entertaining and emotional movie. Besides having some well known actors they have a NEW young star named Jeremy Sumpter. I think that Jeremy was finominal (i dont know how to spell it) in the Local Boys and i also think that Erikc Christian Olsen was wonderful. This movie ( Local Boys) has been my all time favorite movie since it came out !!!! Well thank you for your time. Thanks a lot!
4,some good surfing,"I had to take off one point for amateurish photography and videotaping. There was a lot of good surfing, but I think a better beach with bigger waves could of been chosen. This movie has Jeremy Sumpter filmed in 2002, I liked his acting in this movie, but it was not as good as his acting in Peter Pan (2004). If you're just curious, then rent the movie before choosing to buy it."
3,"Not a masterpiece, but enjoyed it anyway","The story is predictable, the writing sophomoric. Yet I still managed to enjoy it, and I appreciated the performances given by Mark Harmon and especially Jeremy Sumpter as ""Skeet"". Jeremy is an amazing young actor (check him out in ""Frailty"" if you haven't already) who brings a natural charm to his character -- he never seems forced or phony. Might even bring a tear to your eye in a couple scenes <sniff>. ;) Mark Harmon is quite the pro at this kind of thing and a pleasure to watch. Same for most of the rest of the cast. As I said, this is not a masterpiece, but it's an OK little surf-oriented movie with nice cinematography and music, and a decent enough story to hold my interest."
1,not for diabetics,"I have been a diabetic for 10 years. I just expected this book to add something to my existing knowledge. It so introductory.. and does not give any additional information, then what diabetics already know"
2,Minimal benefits for gestational diabetic patients,"I purchased this book knowing that one person had rated it poorly... however without any other reviews, I took a chance. I agree with the first rater, this book is ""basic"".... it gives more detail on what every pregnant woman should do while pregnant... and what all the books on pregnancy already suggest. The only chapter that I found beneficial for me with gestational diabetes was the chapter on how the different insulins work within the human body. Other than that, the place that I found the best info. for gestational diabetes was on parentsplace.com message boards.... topic (pregnant and diabetic). Someone needs to write a good informative book for women with GD."
3,Disappointing volume size,I was expecting a book as lengthy as the other What to Expect books. However this book is probably 1/5 to 1/6 of that size. The little information provided is useful. However it doesn't break it down into weeks (or months for that matter) as I was expecting.
2,HORRIBLE,"First off, I love Johnny Thunders and Wayne Kramer but his CD of some pretty sad concerts is awful. Johnny sounds like is is at the height of his addiction and is often lackluster or incoherant. Wayne's guitar work is fine. I was looking forward to a meeting of the two but this was disjointed. I can see why they didn't stick it out. Once again, I love Thunders but I felt sorry for Kramer to have to work this way. Also, the sound sucks. If you need this for your Thunders collection, go for it."
3,I have this strange feeling of Deja Vu!,"Upon receiving this book, I began to devour every word, thouroughly enjoying the information contained therein. Courious aout one entry, I decided to cross reference this book with a CD-Rom that I purchased 5 years ago, entitled ""Mind of a Killer"". I discovered, much to my dismay, that this book is a word-for-word rehash of the information contained in the book portion of the 1995 CD-Rom, specifically ""Hunting Humans"" written by Michael Newton.While I liked this book, I felt cheated. Aren't there laws against self-plagarism?"
3,Interesting,"I felt the book was very interesting, very well organized, but to me it lacked something. Not sure how to put my finger on it but a good reference."
5,Michael Newton never disappoints!,"Well-written and comprehensive, a gold mine of information. No true-crime library would be complete without this book!"
3,GOT THE WRONG PRODUCT,I had went to the movie section to order the movie. Apparently the sound track for the movie was on the wrong page. I received the sound track instead of the movie. Not sure whose mistake it was. So now I have the sound track. Its a great sound track though.
4,Cute!,"I thought this was a neat product for our lab Bo, but my husband said ""NO WAY"" (I got the pink one) I will still pack it along on our camping trips....Probably the fastest service I have ever had from ordering online."
2,aurora ball belly ring,"i was pleased when the item arrived, until i wore it. the aurora finish came off after only a couple hours wear now it's just a black ball. i love body candy products but will stick to the metal jewelry in the future"
5,Duck Easy Stick Permanent Two Sided Tape,Good price for a good product. Delivery was a little slower than I would have liked.
1,Skip this machine,"This machine worked great, for about 10 minutes. Then, I smelled something burning and the motor blew up. It won't turn on at all now. The rotating brush seemed to really struggle on my thick carpet. The cleaning power though for that first 10 minutes, was exceptional. It did leave large lint balls all over the floor so you'll have to follow up with a vac after the carpet is dry. I'm not sure whether to exchange it for a new one (maybe I just got a lemon) or to forget Bissell all together."
1,"Ok for awhile, but then....","I purchased this product about 2 years ago and was quite impressed in the beginning as it did a pretty good job when it was new. Now, I have USED this product as I have two cats, a dog, and two little boys who like to spill. I have never burned a belt; however, the suction ability of this product seemed to get worse the more it was used. It also left my carpet 'crunchy' after using the soap on 'high traffic' or 'half-traffic' so I just used water for the last year. And the integrity of this product is not good as my lever to release product to my carpet would 'stick' so water would continue to spray into my carpet when I released it. I am now in the process of disassembling it to put into the garbage easier and going to get a Hoover."
1,JUNK!!!,"I just took mine out of the box, and back in the box it will go. From the first time I turned it on, it leaks, in fact, spewing water and cleaning solution from the hose attachment. After hitting the button a few times, I did get it to stop spewing water/solution but it still dripped all over the floor. Additionally, it isn't picking up too much water out of the carpeting as compared to my last steam cleaner. NOT A GOOD PRODUCT!"
1,Give this machine negative 5 stars,This machine worked twice before it stopped spraying water and solution from the machine. I went online and read some reviews and found that it is famous for soap clogging the lines. I got rid of this piece of junk and bought the Hoover steam cleaner off HSN and LOVE it! It works great and even has a blow dryer underneath which dries the carpet fast. Save your money and DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!
1,hopeless mess,I have just thrown away my second and last Bissell Carpet Cleaner. This machine is so poorly designed and cheaply made that it is a poor value. I used the second machine for exactly 5 months before it would no longer pull the water from the cleaned carpet. I had taken the first machine to the authorized repair service location that was 60 miles round trip from my home. I paid almost $100.00 for repair work that extending the life of the machine for 3 months. I will not be purchasing another Bissell product
1,Save your money,"I purchased this product five years ago and had cause to regret it by the third use, when the hand tools stopped working. (I'm not doing a ton of cleaning with this machine- I have only two carpeted rooms in my home.)Sometimes it would dispense water and soap and sometimes it wouldn't. Usually, I could make it work by thumping it around a bit. I've taken it apart and cleaned it and it hasn't helped. As of last year, it would only dispense liquids from the area used to hold the soap, which I filled with clear water. This allowed for about a 3-foot x 3-foot area of cleaning. As of yesterday, it will only dispense water from that reservoir if it is set to full soap, and the machine will no longer suck up any liquids whatsoever, leaving me with a wet carpet.It was a mistake from the get-go and I wish I'd taken it back immediately.I will never own a Bissell again!!"
1,Please save your money!,"I am absolutely shocked that Bissell would allow it's name on such a poor quality product! In the first place, it is not a steamer at all, it uses hot water from the tap, but that's not the worst of it. It worked fine the first time I used it but it's been all downhill from there. The half moon device that makes up half of the suction nozzle catches on a Berber rug so the machine will not move in the forward direction. The customer service department (India?) is not particularly helpful either. I got this machine as a gift so I won't complain to the person who gave it to me but I would have been so much better off renting!"
2,I'd rather rent!,"I thought buying a carpet cleaner made more sense than renting one each time but now I'm having second thoughts. First of all, the name is slightly misleading, this proSTEAMER doesn't actually produce any steam at all. What's more troubling is that I've used this particular machine no more than three times within a year and a half and it just pooped out on me today. There is a serious malfunction with the motor, Bissell is replacing the entire unit for me but I think I would rather simply get the money back and rent from now on."
2,Doesn't last,"While this machine worked, it worked very well. It did not last long. After about a year and a half it did not dispense the water and solution, a reason for this could not be found as the belts and tubes were fine. Considering the price of this carpet cleaner compared to others I felt I did get my monies worth as I did use it alot before it broke down. It did leave hair balls so the carpet has to be vacuumed after it is dried."
1,Very Unhappy with Product,"I agree completely with the person who said the Bissel broke beyond repair after warranty was up. I just put mine in the trash and it was only a year-and-a-half old. I'm disgusted. I had it fixed once and it broke again.I only cleaned two 9x12 rooms and one 5x8 rug, and I cleaned them about every 3-4 months. Sothis cleaner bombed out way too soon. It was not from overuse.For the short time it worked, it cleaned quite well but did leave tufts of dog hair on the carpet.I'll never buy another Bissel."
2,My cheap Hoover was better,"I have to agree with the other reviews, this is not one of the better steam cleaners. I had problems with the flex hose popping out of the tool caddy. It is very difficult to get the power cord and the flex hose wrapped around the tool caddy properly. I also noticed like others the dust bunnies being left behind. All in all, it did an alright job of cleaning the carpet ( I have only used it one time so far, so I'll have to keep my fingers crossed nothing goes wrong next time)."
5,A magical journey...,"Loved this mystical tale of empowerment and discovery, which the author has woven into a beautifully poetic foray into Caribbean lore and magic. It is a quick read, but you won't want to rush through it. Like a glass of fine wine, it is meant to be savored, letting the imagery and message waft through your heart and soul."
5,Good book,A nice book that has elements of a mystery book in it but is a good book about a sage hero.
5,great,NO issues. Varnish was thick and clear. Worked great for what I needed. apparently I need more words to write this review.
3,"Great, except for...","This device has great sound quality. I use it primarily for my workouts; it can also connect to my BT cell phone, however, I tried to switch from my ipod to my cell phone and got a conflict and it took quite a while to reset everything. I bought the BT adapter with my S9. I advise a prospective buyer NOT to buy the Motorola BT 30 pin connecter. Whenever the ipod is jiggled or moved, the ipod goes to pause and the adapter has to find your phone again; really annoying during workouts. I do advise buying the smaller Sony BT 30 pin adapter because it fits beeter when using a case and is more stable. You may also consider buying an BT that connects to the headphone plug as well.Good unit, except for the Motorola adapter!"
2,Cool Idea but battery life sucks,"I would spend my money else where, Deal with the wire headphones and save the moneyThis product looked cool and would work well for travelers, but the battery life is so short that you can barely watch a movie and recharging it is a time taking endeavor."
3,Amazing When it Works!,"This product is AMAZING when it works as advertised. I bought this product, falling for its ""sweat/water-resistant"" tagline, but unfortunately it's not. I can't go through a gym session where it will exhibit bizarre behavior, including RANDOMLY SELECTING HEADSET BUTTONS for me. This fully includes the Call Button, which will call the last person dialed. Totally embarrassing.But when this thing is working, it's a MONSTER! Totally in love with the quality of the sound. It's everything that I am looking for with an ""active"" pair of headphones, if only they were as sweat/water resistant as they claim to be..."
2,Comfortable but cuts out constantly,"This is a nice set of headphones that actually produce decent quality sound. The convenience of having no cord is great. Unfortunately, in any fairly crowded area they cut in and out constantly. They are thus useless for using to actually talk, and listening to music is incredibly frustrating. I wore these to work everyday for almost a month until I finally gave up on them. If I rest my phone on the back of my neck on top of my collar (as close as physically possible to the headset) I usually get good reception..."
4,Handsfree Sometimes Stereo,"The handsfree Motorola S9 is a very good product, but it isn't compatible with all bluetooth devices in stereo mode. I have a Nokia N73 mobile and with the handsfree don't work in stereo mode, anyway neither Nokia nor Motorola sites writte about compatibility with specific devices, only protocols or standards.Anyway, I had used my S9 with Motorola mobiles and It work really fine, almost hi-fi sound, it's a good choice.Bye.NCC"
3,great compared to what it out there,"shortcomings as discussed by others. sound is decent , but find that the round earphone covers included in the box are the only ones that provide the best comfort , fit , and positioning for sound.ambient noise is sometimes a problem.i look forward to the next generation of bluetooth sports headphones!"
4,Great for the gym,Over all pleased with itHave had it cut off like other reviews have saidI think it has to do with you laying on your back.It happens when I am stretching.Also when you lay down it will hit the ground / bench so you can't wear it while bench pressing or any thing you relax your head on somethingOr it might be because I have a big head.But the sound is good & it last most off the week I charge it on Sunday night go to gym Mon Wed & Fri for music & the occasional phone call but I don't use it for any thing else & I am only using it about 45 min a day. I definitely recommend it for the gym. You don't have to worry about wires so it makes it safer & I have never had them slip off. Oh call quality is good no has told me to use the handset. I use to get that a lot w/my Samsung wep200 & Motorola h700.
2,Don't waste your money,"This is a well designed, comfortable product with decent audio results...it is simply too bad that it isn't as advertised.The biggest problem is its blue tooth connectivity. At best it is spotty. If you would like a headset that will function pretty well while you are sitting down and the back of the headset is pointing toward your Motorola phone, then this is a decent product. If, however, you actually want to move with both headset and phone, forget it."
1,These headphone are AWFUL!,"I had these headphones for less than two days before I started having trouble with them! They would refuse to sync to phones, sound quality was fair, but that doesn't matter if you cannot use them! I couldn't get them to sync with my laptop either. They would constantly fight me! I'd have to turn it off then back on several times and try to sync to them until they finally would sync. I exchanged them with a second pair, and still had the same issue! What phones? Motorola cliq, HTC snap, Laptop, and Tower, and PS3! They all had issues with these headphones! They sucked as bad as the Moto Cliq and Motorola's support!They also shutdown constantly. sync them to your phone and wait for a call. Oh wait, since you waited 5 minutes before you got a call the headphones shut off and you cannot receive the call using your headphones! Waste of money and waste of time! They are garbage!"
2,Don't buy,"I had these and they worked great for about a month, then all the sweat seeps in and ruins them, I had 2 pairs replaced and when my 3rd pair took a crap I said screw it!"
2,Wireless Headset,"I could not wait to use the headset. After the first 30 days, I do not use when I run. It causes problems with my itouch probably because of the liquid getting into the unit. I was disappointed. Now I use it when I am sitting around watching movies on my itouch. If you want to run with this item, not going to happen."
2,Be prepared to replace often,"I bought these, replaced with HD model and it died the same death. Moisture gets in and the controls go out. I'm trying other brands. Btw, the track controls don't work on iPad or iPhone. Lotta money for broken volume control.Motorola MOTOROKR S9 Bluetooth Stereo Headphones"
2,good when it works,"The headset worked well one of the 10 times that I tried it. The problems that I have consist of the volume going down for no reason, losing connectivity to bluetooth, and difficulties syncing with my bluetooth device. The concept is great, and that 1/10 times it worked, I thought I had the product I was searching for to meet my sport/telephone needs, but the results have been inconsistent."
3,"Lightweight, good fit, OK sound quality, terrible durability.","I bought these to run and work out with. I was initially happy with them, even though the sound quality is sacrificed for the convenience of the hands-free design. Bluetooth reception is ok, but far from perfect. Signal drops sometimes when not in line of sight with mp3 player, and range is not impressive. The real problem is that they don't hold up to sweat AT ALL. My first pair fried after about two months, so I got a replacement pair. I took the rubber ear adapters off and cleaned the speakers off almost every time I used it, but it still gave up the ghost after a few weeks. They are tempting to buy if you like gadgets or want a lightweight set of hands-free headphones, but save your money and spend it on another product."
4,I love my headphones. Freedom!,"These headphones have changed my life. I have a small child and use these around the house while she is taking her nap. I can listen to the news, music, podcasts, etc. I have them linked to my iphone and it works rather well. The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is because the volume buttons are a bit annoying to use. They are on the same rocker switch as the button to make a phone call. I have accidentally dialed when I was trying to adjust the volume of whatever I was listening to. However, this is a MINOR inconvenience compared with the cordless freedom I have. I would not hesitate to recommend these. I'm sure the next version will improve on the design. For $50, well worth it now."
2,Motorolla S9 Bluetooth Headphones,It is lighter and smaller than it's predecessor the 820 but when making calls you only hear out of the left side. The sound quality is not as good and it does not sync up with Skype as the 820 did. Overall I was unhappy and returned the product. I have since purchased a different brand blue tooth stereo head set I am much happier with.
4,Does NOT work with the iPhone,"As of July 1, 2007, the MOTOROKR is not compatible with the iPod function of the iPhone. Hopefully Apple will create some enhancements that will make this work. You can only use the headphones to make/answer calls right now. My brief experience with that was pretty good. The microphone was clear. The headphones are incredibly light. It is a little cumbersome as it does not fold. Then again, no has stepped up to create an ""awesome stereo headset"" and this is the best there is currently. Since all the geniuses are at Apple, maybe they can come up with something before the decade is over."
1,Not for working out.,"At first I gave this product a 8 out of 10 on CNET. But after using during workouts for a few weeks the side buttons stopped working. Low and behold I found out many people who did reviews of these headphones were having the exact same problem. Some over and over again after sending multiple pairs back to Motorola for replacement. Apparently, sweat is the issue. In addition, the buttons on my Moto Q9 do not operate the headphones. Thus, your only option is to use the buttons on the S9's. So if you want to use these primarily while working out (which is why I bought them!), do not waste your time. They will break down. Big waste of money."
3,Incompatible with iPhone 3g,"I was disappointed to find that this does not work with the iPhone 3G. I will do my homework a little better next time because this company does not give the full money back, they charge a 25% restocking fee."
3,Problem with advirtising,"The phone only works on the left ear. For those who need the phone on the right ear (because of hearing loss) what is one to do ? Any suggestions by motorola would be appreciated. It is great to get the range I need but I have no ""clarity"" of hearing in the left so I can't use it for the phone. Only stereo......please share some insight.......THEY DID NOT MENTION THE PHONE ONLY BEING HEARD ON THE LEFT SIDE ANYWHERE ON THE BOX OR IN ADS..."
1,Connection problems,"I don't know how people are rating this product anything more than a few stars. I've paired the S9s with the Naviplay bluetooth adapter, and a Cingular 8525 smartphone. Both were unacceptable for walking around outside due to the poor connection to my devices. Maybe its that I live in a city environment and as such there may be more radio interference. These are definitely going back to the factory."
1,POS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The S9 is the biggest POS out there. Once you sweat on them the volume button stops working. What the heck is with that!!!!! I have had this for less then a day and the reception and distance are horrible compared to my Jabra Dog tag and the volume is not working at all. Total waste of money if you want to use them for the gym or any activity that you might perspire. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!
1,Totally worthless for workouts!,"O.K., O.K., I know there are numerous reviews here that warn that these headphones fail if you sweat on them, but I decided to try them anyways. If you want to use these for workouts, do not ignore the warnings - go buy something else.I received them yesterday, paired them to my blackberry, and headed out to the gym. They worked great for about 30 minutes, then the left speaker and all controls on the left side (volume up, down, and phone buttons) ceased to work. I was definitely sweating, but come on they don't even last 30 minutes??? Sent them back to Amazon this morning. Maybe I'll try the Jaybirds next-"
1,So far pretty terrible.,"I'm using these headphones for the iphone 3G. I would like to rid myself of wires but clearly that's not going to be possible. Audio on these headphones cuts in and out. I've traded the hassle of wires for the hassle of constantly holding my phone near my head. The controls are not working. I can't skip tracks. I could understand some compatibility issues but I should be able to perform the basic operation that I can with the one button wired headphones that came with the iphone. One button! This device has seven. At times, the device won't connect to my phone. Audio from phone calls only works in one ear. Why?It did work for thirty minutes while I ran on the treadmill. The design however, is not as workout friendy as I had hoped. The heavy transmitter on the back pulls and tugs while you run and is not comfortable.I may keep these for the Gym. I haven't decided, but I don't recommend buying. Motorola didn't get anything right with this one. I feel a little duped."
1,"Malfunction, Malfunction, Malfunction, had to exchange 3 times!!!",If you plan on sweating this headphone set is not for you! Sound quality is great; however once you start to sweat your microphone will go out. This happened on all three headsets I bought at best buy within a few weeks. I think I will try the Jaybird 200.
3,Great while it lasts,"I'm on my 3rd pair in 2 weeks...most definitely not sweat proof.I bought these specifically to wear while bicycling on my roller-trainer. The first pair was defective out of the box...a lot of crackle from the left speaker. The second pair lasted for 8 days of bicycling before suffering from the ""controls won't work"" problem a lot of other people are complaining about.Quite simply...if you have no itention of getting sweaty with these on, the audio quality is great, the functions intuitive but depending on your ear shape the headset may or may not feel comfortable. If you are hoping to work out while wearing these, you really should keep looking. Well, either that or Frankenstein some kind of anti moisture solution that Motorola shoulda done in the first place....I'm gonna try silicone sealing my 3rd set."
3,S9 works OK,"These headphones work about as promised. Not great sound quality but I am able to leave my Treo 700p in my gym bag and wander across the room using the various workout equipment and still hear my tunes pretty well. The little annoying control buttons on the 2 sides of the phones take a bit getting used to but they are usable. I wish they didn't ""beep"" with every push. Battery life has so far been fine. I recommend this product as long as you're not an audiophile and just want to listen to your music without the hassle of wires."
1,Save your money,"I was excited to purchase this headset and use it on runs. The setup was easy, however the sound was very intermintant. I tried it on two different phones and my computer. They all had the same problem. Each item worked fine on my other bluetooth ear piece. I assumed that it was defective and I had it replaced however it had the same problem.Save your money and buy it when they work out the bugs"
4,Wireless Freedom,"I found these in retail packaging for $0.01 on Amazon (price error?). I use them constantly at the gym and love them! I sweat quite a bit and have not experienced any issues with the product not working due to that. The range is quite good and I can walk across the gym to get stuff to clean my machine without any interruption in the music. They do pinch and slide a little, and turning one's head makes these seem a bit cumbersome at the back of the neck.They are also great for working in the yard, though not quite as loud as I need them while using the blower and I think the engine creates some interference. I heard that there is now a Motorokr-S9-HD which I'll have to check out.I tried using these as a hands-free headset for my cell phone, but the caller on the other end said there was way too much background noise and that I was very inaudible. But I didn't buy these for my cell phone.Overall, great product to free the iPod from annoying wires."
1,S9 Motorokr Headphones,"I've owned my headphones for a little over 13 months. They worked fine until last week they stopped charging and won't turn on. Motorola's warranty expires at 12 months so I'm on my own with this. I did like being able to go wireless, but will not buy another product that fails so quickly and without support. I recommend looking elsewhere."
1,Waste of Money!,"After 2 sweaty workouts the volume is stuck on the lowest setting...can't adjust...wtf motorola - was this designed for ""active"" workouts?"
1,Choppy and proprietary charger,"Be careful. This product works as advertised with the exception that the music is choppy which is very annoying. It cuts off for about 5 seconds and then resumes. It does this about every 5-10 minutes. Another annoying feature is that even though it uses a mini-usb to charge, the standard voltage to charge it was changed my Motorola so that you cannot use anything to charge it except a Motorola charger built for this headset which is grossly overpriced. (Some have reported that connecting the USB to a computer will work - but mine did not).Motorola - if you are listening - stop making customers stock up on chargers that only work on your products. My IGO charger works beautifully on all of my electronics except this one, which I will promptly return for that reason alone. I am tired of this kind of corporate practice that makes me buy a new wall-wart for every piece of electronic equipment I own, plus another one for the car."
2,"Great sound, uncomfortable to wear, terrible reception outside.","I found these headphones very uncomfortable, and the large piece in the back very irritating when moving my head, though they sounded great. The total dealbreaker for me was that they would barely work outside, and I had to literally hold my Tmobile G1 up to the reception bar in the back to get them to work. YMMV depending on head size I guess, but they didn't work for me and I an average size head. I ended up going with the motorokr S305, and am very pleased."
2,Forget it with the G1,"This is a pretty solid product, but it's Achilles heel is the super short range.With my T-Mobile G1, it was impossible to use outside even when wearing the phone on a belt around the back. The only way to guarantee a connection is to basically hold the phone up nearby the receiver.The product packaging includes a picture of a guy's torso with a cylinder around it, starting several inches ABOVE the belt, and below the shoulders. Essentially, they're recommending you put your phone in a bandolier along your back. Who does that?In fact, it tends to cut out even when carrying the phone out of pockets beside you. So either the receiver is very poor, or the transmitter (the phone itself) is poor. It can also cut out if sitting down with the phone in your lap or browsing the web on the phone (because your body is between it and the receiver at the back).In short, avoid unless you're sure that your phone is a rock star of a bluetooth transmitter, above and beyond spec."
5,I love these head phones,"I have the LG enV and these head phones sound great when listening to music and talking on the phone. No can believe they are talking to me on a bluetooth devise. The music sounds perfect for yard work, traveling or work. The only issue is if you have phone in pocket the music cuts out if signal can not get to head phones - simple to correct by placing phone in shirt pocket. Get them - you will not be disappointed."
1,I wish you could choose 0 (Zero) Stars,"This product sync'd up pretty quick. It was powered out of the box, though I charged it for a hour or 3 right after first use. I've had it set for my pearl 8130 (new from sprint), my work computer, my co-wokers (a few of them)'s computers as well as my wife and kid's. Varrying usb bluetooth connectors (my kid's laptop has his built in) and they all are the same. Static is constant from any high pitched sound. Listening to metallica, tool, tim mcgraw or vivaldi, dosen't matter. They all are horrible quality. It's a world of difference from the ht820's.... Atleast amazon takes their stuff back. Perhaps I need a way to rate the product and rate the seller (product 0, seller on a scale of 1 to 5, amazon is a 8)..."
1,very uncomfortable!,"Pros: good pairing and consistent stream. Decent sound although not loud enough.Cons: very uncomfortable fit(my ears hurt just after an hour of having them on), lots of background noise, sound doesn't get loud enough in pulic busy places, extremely annoying when you wear any jacket since you keep feeling it catch.Bottom line: Don't buy it! The participles for a good device is there but they need to improve on the design and make a lot more comfortable before people can start enjoy using it."
1,Find something else,"These are the most horribly uncomfortable set of headphones on earth. I can't wear them more than 30 minutes before my ears start feeling like they are falling off...I bought them for work, so I can sit and listen to my music without having to worry about wires...well I am at work for 8+ hours...obiovusly too much pain to keep them on, making them utterly useless...Also useless in the car since the headset is behind the head, the head rest in the car hits it...Jackets too if its winter...Buy something else."
4,Motorokr S9,"Great item, but it only worked with phone calls, even though it said it would work with my phone. Found out after calling Motorola & Sony Ericsson It would'nt play music from my phone. Had to return it."
2,not for people with long hair!,There are just okay. They do not fit very well and my hair keeps getting caught in them! OUCH! The sound quality could be better as well.
1,Motorola S9 Pack contents,"Hello there, Can somebody please tell me the contents on this product? I,ve got it as a gift but I cannot pair it with my mp3 player since there is no assosiation card...even tough the manual says it comes with the S9.Thanks"
2,perfect stereo but bad for workout,"Pro's-- I can mention only one, perfect stereo sound for MusicCon's-- Absolutely bad ergonomic design, ur neck n shoulders pain after u have it for more than 20min--Cant use them for running or any kind of workout--The battery behind the neck will be hanging n buds in ur ears will be shifting which pinches ur ears very badly--Buttons beeps inconsistenly even though you didnt press them so many times-- Decreases volume on its own, even though you are increasing itI have purchased the black headset and had the above issues with that, got a replacement with a red headset from Amazon, same issues repeated. I even tried changing the buds with small and larger apart from default medium to avoid pinching the ears but i couldnt take it anymore.If you want to use a BT headset just to talk with out moving anywhere this is the best piece u can get but otherwise big NO NO.."
5,Works Great With iPhone 3GS,"I purchased the MOTOROKR S9 headphones to use with my new iPhone 3GS. The 3GS is bluetooth enabled and doesn't need an adaptor. The S9 headphones are perfect for anyone who hates being wired while listening to your mp3 player. The S9's have convenient volume and track controls on either side above each earpiece. These headphones also double as a bluetooth speakerphone for phone calls. The sound quality is remarkably good for headphones in this price range. Altogether, the S9's are a great buy."
2,Sounds good...don't use for exercise!,"This product worked fine until I used it for working out, and getting sweat on it. These are marketed as the ""active person's solution"" but in reality you cannot use them for working out unless you don't sweat. I went through two of these and got tired of working with Motorola on replacements. After about a month of use, 4-5 times a week in a workout environemnt, the buttons stopped working."
2,Motorola S9,"I've owned this product for about one month and work out heavily with them. The product is great, good sound easy to use, however, don't sweat. After one particularly hard workout and yes lots of sweat.. the head phones stopped working. Very bad design flaw for someone who is active. I highly recommend them for someone who wants a low profile head set and will not be working out with them."
3,Worked fine for awhile,"Bought these in Aug 07 and they worked great out of the box. They were especially good in the gym or anywhere inside, but had a very limited range outdoors. When jogging you have to keep your device strapped to your arm-which is not a big deal and the headset works good. Reason the review is in the past tense is that from one use to the next the volume up control stopped working. The volume down button worked, so I tried lowering the volume to the bottom and then increase..oh well..it reached the bottom and won't increase, so essentially you can't hear any sound out of it any longer. I'll now have to deal with the warranty dept of Motorola I suppose. But I wouldn't buy these again, as I have read of this defect in other reviews"
1,S9 Headphones,"While the idea behind them is great (and they are comfortable to use while working out), I have had two pairs now and both seem to have had functionality issues within a matter of a week or so of use. Problems develop regarding use of the controls and then the headset simply starts to adjust volume down or worse still it jumps around on tracks. Currently, my headset has no controls working at all but I can control from the iPod (but that defeats the purpose of having the headset)."
4,Nice product to have,"Pros: It has good sound quality, long battery life, nice bluetooth connectivity(outdoors+indoors).Cons: While making calls sound can be heard only through left speaker, it would been better if sound could be heard from both speakers.I was planning to buy a PC headset and a bluetooth headset(use in car), but this product was solution to both my requirements. :)"
3,"Good, but weird","So i just pulled these headphones out of retirement today because i got my iPhone 4s and needed Bluetooth headphones for the gym.Pros:ComfortableEasy to connectMultitude of controls on headsetTakes callsPretty good at eliminating most outside noisesCons:Sometimes randomly shuts offShort battery lifeCan make ears sore if worn for a long timeOverall, these are okay. The randomly shutting off is beyond annoying and i will be getting another pair soon. I"
1,Very uncomfortable!,I returned these after one day. Very uncomfortable...killed my hears and side of my head. I would recommend looing elseware.
1,Junk,"I always like to give a product a reasonable amount of time before I review it. That said, my ultimate conclusion after nearly a year of ownership is that this thing is junk. Great concept and nice design but the thing simply did not live up to my (reasonable) expectations. Did not always maintain the Bluetooth connection with my computer consistently, range was very poor and the sound quality was at best, average. Today, it died -- doesn't charge and doesn't turn on anymore - after less than a year of use and not ""hard"" use at all. I used it on average twice a week for a few hours at a time. I guess will make an attempt to get a replacement but I'm not holding my breath."
2,The ear piece break off quite easily,"The ear piece for this item break off quite easily. If you do decide to order the item, be aware of that and take a corded headphone with you and the battery dies out pretty fast when using it because of the bluetooth connection. I would not purchase this item again. Still waiting to get the item repaired. Not even sure this is feasible."
1,It won't last long,"I read a few other reviews of the product from folks who said that they wouldn't get more than 3 months use out of these headphones but I thought I'd take a chance. Out of the box I was very impressed with the sound quality. But I noticed that the sound quality would drop off a few miles into a hard run. Sweat gets in the earpieces and they sound tinney. After 2 months of use (twice a week) and an hour and a half run, they are unusable. They will still connect with my phone but there is barely any sound and the buttons are unusable. If you have no intention of working out with the product they may last. But for me that defeats the purpose."
1,"great, when it works....but I'm on my 3rd...","Pros: I gor this headset about 10 months ago and I loved it. It was great for working out, battery lasted for 4 or so days before I had to charge it and the sound quality was excellent.Cons: It kept on breaking! Every 2-4 months it would stop working! Since it was warranted to a year, I kept bringing it back to the store and getting new one. Personally, I think that moisture was entering the electronics through the charging mechanism. Would definitaly not recommend it for working out."
1,Not worth it even if cheap,"I got these headphones for 30 bucks thinking YES!!! They were horrible in the gym. The volume control instantly failed and then the track selector. But, wait, that isn't the worst part. For folks that lay on their back for any exercise in the gym, don't get these. They really aren't that loud to begin with, but when you lay down say for bench, the back part pushes against your neck, and then the ear buds pop out. Now you don't hear any music.If you are just going on a road trip and can get these for cheap,...maybe then, but not for the gym."
1,really wanted to like this,"I really wanted to like this product. I found the S9's design cool and smart.However, in-spite of being easy to bind, use, and having great stereo sound. I can't recommend anyone by this headset for the simple reason that it drops the stereo signal constantly (at least with my T-Mobile G1). According to the manual, the ""optimum"" place to keep your phone for best reception is anywhere above your elbows. I placed my phone in my front shirt pocket and the signal would still drop in and out. Disappointed."
2,Perfectly acceptable headphones... If you don't move,"These headphones worked fine if I was stationary, sitting or standing on the metro for example. However, once I began moving, the sound would begin cutting out, even if I had my iPhone about 2 feet from the headphones in my hand, or in my shirt pocket, less than a foot away.In addition, the phone capability of the headset was useless, as too much ambiant noise was transferred along with my voice to the caller.I gave it two stars instead of one since I figure some people may like to use it without moving, but for me that is pointless.One final note, as others have observed, the earphones themselves were very uncomfortable and caused siginificant pain in my outer ear."
2,Not a workout partner,"I was looking for a pair of wireless headphones that I could use to listen to music and workout with....these failed. They worked great to start with, but I think once they were exposed to some sweat they died. But, they probably work great for everyday use otherwise. Sound is ok, not concert quality, but good enough. For those wondering, I had this paired to a Jabra A120s Bluetooth Music Adapter. Works flawlessly. Easy to set up and basically makes anything a headphone adapter into a bluetooth wireless device. Only caveat is that there is no control over the device like with an Ipod."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I was a bit disappointed in two aspects of this headset:1) When making/receiving calls (the primary reason I purchased the headset), the sound only comes out of one ear. The corded headset that came with my phone (the one I was replacing with this headset) put the sound to both ears when making/receiving calls. This was a major downer for me. Worse, the one ear that it puts the sound to is my left ear, forcing me to wear the thing upside down to get the sound to my right ear (where I prefer to listen to phone calls, if limited to one ear).2) Several people have complained of hearing excessive background noise when I use the headset outdoors or in the car. While a certain amount of background noise is unavoidable in such places, it is much worse than with my corded headset."
1,S9 Only For Motorola's Own Cell Phones?,"I used it with my Samsung/Cingular Blackjack. When listening to music it kept ""cutting out"" and did not work well at all.I called Motorola cust svc and they had the nerve to suggest that I should consider using a Motorola cell phone for it to work properly. I've retured my unit for a full refund. The music sounded great when it worked, but who wants to hear only every other sentence of a song?"
1,not so great,"No one can hear a word im saying on the headset. so it sucks for a hands free headset on the cell phone. as far as just a regular headset for music, it sucks in that aspect too. the wacky shape of it does not allow the earbuds to remain in the ear canal. they sit out too far away, so u cant really hear anything too well. what a waste of money."
4,"Works good, not perfect","This headset is really nice feature-wise. I love using my windows mobile phone as a primary MP3 player. The play/forward/rewind controls work well on the right ear, and the phone/volume controls on the left. This also works great with your PC if you have bluetooth capability. I have no issue with the fit although I can see where somebody with a larger head might. The sound is good-not great, but not terrible. If I could get more volume out of them that might help. This is my only minor complaint. Also, in the description it says USB charger included. I only received a wall charger. A USB charger would be nice, because the battery life runs short when using it as a stereo headset."
3,right earpiece issues,"I purchased these while visiting nyc at the t-mobile store. They we're great until suddenly the right headphone completely died, 5 days after i purchased it, on the taxi ride to the airport.I may have gotten a bad batch, but i'll wait awhile before trying another pair. other than the right ear piece issue these we're an awesome pair of headphones / handfree"
3,Lots of potential,"They look great, comfortable, decent sound but will break within 90 days. I am one of many that have had this happen to them. the touch buttons are defective ... the question is how long until the same happens to you and will ou be able to return them?"
2,BUYER BEWARE! - Should be 1 Star!,"I loved these headphones, until I worked out! Motorola claims that these are waterproof and sweatproof, they are not. I got one pair which died the second time I wore them for a workout. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and got another pair. The second pair crapped out on the second workout. It starts with a repeating beep, and then stops, then the buttons stop working one by one. It amazes me how fast the headphones will die. I workout fairly hard, but it is only 1 hour to 1.5 hours a day and it has been consistent on the second workout about 45 minutes in. I even dried the headphones off ever 5 - 10 minutes on the second pair(which was a pain)! If you don't sweat (AT ALL) these are the headphones for you, if you do, don't waste your money.SHAME ON YOU MOTOROLA - You shouldn't advertise sweatproof if it is not!REMINDER - The box claims sweatproof, which we already know is not tested, so what else about the product might not be tested.BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
3,how do i get this paired with my 3gen ipod touch?,"my itouch found Motorola S9 but it is not connected.i try to get it connected but it is not connecting.i tested Motorola S9 with my PS3 and it worked.Motorola S9 supposed to ask me to put pin number but it's not asking me to put any pin.i don't know what is wrong with this, help please."
1,The speakers on my blackberry are better,The worst motorola product I have ever used and I'm a shareholder. Turns off or disconnects radomly. battery lasts 30 minutes. If I turn my head the connection becomes distorted. Don't waste your money.
1,try to return it,"Too small for me, even I have a small head. Contact the seller to return it but never get response.Anyone wants my headphone?"
1,missing an ear piece,"The product was not complete as it was missing an ear piece, therefore I could not use the product as it was too painful to put in my ear. I was disapointed."
1,MotoRokr S9 - DOA,"Read the reviews online that said there were problems with this unit, thought my experience would be different. First paired with my phone and it worked great, for about a week. Then the buttons stopped working, battery life went to less than 20 minutes and I had to keep pairing it with my phone. Called to Motorola and they had me send it back for RA, they will ship me another in 15 days. Will try again for round two, and if this one dies I will give up and get a single over the ear model."
1,Not for gym,"This headset will not permit anything to contact the back of your head. Thus, using a weight bench at the gym is impossible."
2,Uncomfortable and Bad Sound Quality,"The quality is not that good, especially when comparing to other bluetooth stereo products. Very uncomfortable. Ear area is designed for very small ears. Mine are not huge, normal size, and after 30 minutes of listening I have to readjust because my upper ear becomes very sore. Outside of that, they do what they are designed for. Play music. No issues with it disconnecting when I move. Short battery life (approx 6-8 hours listening time)."
5,I like it.,I enjoy the stereo audio feature listening to music when paired with my cell phone. Pairing was simple and quick.
3,Hope they don't get wet,"This is my 3rd pair. Even though these malfunction if wet, they're still a good value and perform well. I have found spraying the earpieces with leather waterproofing spray has worked well for the last 2 years. Stereo audio is good and communication is fair, with solid (2+ hours) battery life."
3,not for running with a Droid,"I give three stars because I think the product would probably work well for some applications, but for my application (running while streaming music through a Droid phone) it gets one star.The receiver is behind the head, which seems like a nice way to keep it out of the way. But if the Bluetooth device is in front of me, as it would be if I'm running and holding it, or if it is clipped to my waistband or in a pocket, the connection is choppy. A choppy connection is essentially useless for music streaming. I'm returning the product. I may get something else later, but for now I'll continue using my iPod headphones."
1,Poor quality,"The Motorokr S9 works as advertised. Stereo sound is clear and headphones are easy to pair. However, the volume control switch stopped working and got stuck in low volume rendering the unit useless, only after 2 weeks of use. Exchanged the item through AMAZON and got a new pair, which only lasted another 2 weeks of use again. I use them for jogging, and because of the design, a fair amount of sweat can get to the speaker mount and frame. I suspect this made the damage to the microswitches for the volume control, but isn't this unit supposed to be and ACTIVE SPORTS HEADPHONE??? Another case of good design and poor execution."
1,Awful- don't buy it.,"The sound quality is awful. Sounds like a $5 pair of headphones. Works fine inside, but go outside and it won't pick up a signal from a blackberry on your belt. It will however work, if you hold the phone within a foot (12 inches) of your head. Totally defeats the purpose of a wireless device. I have a friend that uses them with the Iphone, and he claims they work fine. Maybe I got a lemon? Or maybe Motorola needs to step up and give it a more powerful receiver and battery.Wait for the next generation to come out. At least wires work.cl"
1,Buyer Beware,I had seen the S9 work well with other phones but it did not work well with mine. Audio kept dropping out listening to music. This product is not compatible with all phones. Check Motorola's website to make sure you have a fully compatible phone before ordering.
4,Better than expected,"I an impressed with the features and function of these headphones. I am waiting for iPhone 3.0 software to be released, but in the time being I am using the headphone with my MacBook Pro and as a BT headset for my phone. Great product!!!"
1,Unreliable,"Works as advertised ... for a while. However, after a little use, and getting some sweat on them (these are sports headphones, right?), the volume buttons failed to work. Worse, the ""down"" button repeated itself, dropping the volume to minimum, and the ""up"" button wouldn't respond, so the headphones became uselessly stuck at very low volume. So I sent this first pair in to Motorola for an exchange. They responded admirably with a new pair. Amazingly, after a few more weeks of use, this new pair did the exact same thing! A bummer because I like the features and convenience.The only other negative is that for phone conversations, the sound only comes in one ear, not both."
2,MOTOROKR S9 Bluetooth,"This worked for maybe a month, I bought it so I can run on my tredmill and after a couple of uses you cannot hear anything out of them. switching from IPOD to phone you have problems with the buttons and making sure it answers the phone correctly. Its not worth the money."
3,"Works well inside, but not outside","Inside these work great- I can walk far from my phone and the sound is awesome- Outside I get a lot of wind interference.. I exchanged them and still had the problem outside. Also they are uncomfortable after wearing for a long time for me. There are better bluetooth headphones out there, but these are just ok .."
1,Terrible,These are just plain bad.- Won't consistently pair with either iphone or computer- Lots of static/noise- Frequent drop-outsDo yourself a favor and buy something better.
3,"Good Sound, but don't sweat on them","I had these for about a year. I lost all function on the buttons months ago because of sweating on them in the gym. Evidently it's a common problem. Also lost function of hearing calls when they came in while I was listening to music. Rather annoying when my son is trying to reach me.They were not comfortable to wear on my head, but if I used a hat or visor underneath I didnt have a problem.The sound was great, range wasnt bad. I went to the jaybird instead of the HD S9 because I really only use the headset for working out. I've had the jaybird for a week, and it's working well."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"As previous reviewers have noted, this headset will short out if sweat gets into the earpieces, which happens quite often. They seem to work ok after drying out for a few days. In addition, they are not very loud (about 60% of the loudness of the standard earphones that come with an iPod). In sum, if you plan to use them at home sitting at your desk, they might be ok, but forget about using them at the gym or to go running."
3,Just a OK product,"volume could be louder & head set does not ""float"" above neck like its supposed to,needs re adjustment frequently to fit if your jogging or lifting weights, still beats having earbud cords though."
1,Youll Be Sorry Ill told you so.....,These are the most uncomfortable bluetooth headset around. Very poor sound quality with constant hissing and very bulky. Sports headset? You cannot run on the treadmill with these because if you turn your head the headset with scratch your ear and fall out. You cannot weight lift on bench because the headphones will pop out when you lay down from the headrest. You cannot DO ANYTHING BUT SIT STILL WITH THESE uncomfortable tight headset on your head. Anyone with glasses should never purchase any headphones or headset that goes around the ear. S9 or most products from motorolla do not seem to have too much thought in the design. HMMM... let see most techno geeks wear glasses so WHY would you design products that go around the ear ???
2,S9 Konks out after SWEAT!!!!! Choppy reception,"I bought S9 from Amazon. Worked great for first run with my Motorola Razr V3xx. After 45 min on full charge, music would get choppy. My phone was in my pocket. Problem got worse if phone was further out or after longer time because battery runs lower on power. So I bought cell phone arm band so phone would be closer to S9 headset. Problem was improved by 90%. Still occasional loss of music signal after 45 min of use with fully charged headset.BIG problem. Ater second run, volume controls konked out. Also the answer button konked out. VERY annoying. After I did a review search, I found out that I wasn't alone. I requested a replacement. I think I will cancel that and get my money back and buy a corded head set."
2,Great while it lasted...,"I purchased these headphones in spite of several reviewers stating that there were issues with the controls. I found that the down volume control ceased to function after only 2 weeks of fairly sweaty use (5k/day).I found that Motorola was less than helpful when I requested a replacement device.On the plus-side, the headphones are incredibly comfortable and convenient.I just expected them to operate reliably for a longer time (even with the sweaty conditions I subjected them to)."
3,Don't SWEAT in them!,"These were purchased for the purpose of exercising in, which I'm sure is the reason most people purchase them. They're pretty pricey and are great until...you sweat! Then the volume stops working right, among other things. So my suggestion for any future purchaser would be, PLEASE don't waste your money unless you intend on keeping them 100 percent dry ALL the time."
1,VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I'M NOT SENDING BACK THESE HEADPHONES ANOTHER TIME. I'M WASTING MONEY IN SHIPPING AND TIME WAITING FOR THE REPLACEMENTS. THE FIRST SET,THE ANSWER BUTTON QUIT WORKING. THE SECOND SET, THE MICROPHONE STOPPED WORKING. THE MICROPHONE WENT OUT IN THE THIRD SET TOO.I WEAR MY PHONE IN AN ARMBAND ON MY LEFT ARM WHICH SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF THE OUTDOOR CONNECTION.THE HEADPHONES ARE A GREAT IDEA, BUT I WILL WAIT FOR ANOTHER GENERATION OF BLUETOOTH STEREO HEADPHONES BECAUSE THESE ARE, SADLY, A WASTE."
2,Worked great while it worked.,"I really enjoyed the S9 while it worked. They're comfy, have good sound and seemed well made. Unfortunately they only worked for about 2 months. Yes, it's under warranty and whatnot, but what a pain. Oh well."
3,"Convenient, BUT","Sound quality when listening to iPod is excellent, BUT when the phone rings you only get sound from one speaker. Ear buds are not as comfortable as I would like. If you use these on a plane or lounge by the pool you cannot lay your head back naturally because the unit is positioned to high..."
4,Almost perfect,"Summary:I recommend this headset, just make sure you are ok with the caveats below.The good:The headset is very comfortable.The sounds is great.It functions well.Buttons make sense and work well.Mini-USB charge port(!!).Paired up with my phone, laptop and DC800 music gateway.The bad:- When outdoors, your source (i.e. phone) has to be above your waist - otherwise the signal breaks up. This is mostly impractical, unless you want to look like a corporate flunky with one those belt clips on. This is the only serious drawback.- When paired up with my Moto KRZR, the REW and FF controls only worked with the basic sound app (which is useless for listening to more than one song at a time). I expected it to control the Java music app, which is much better. I suppose that could be a Moto software issue.- Battery life was so-so. I think I got about 4 hours of music out of it."
2,Not for the PPC 6700,I tried to pair the headphones with my Audivox PPC 6700 and after two days of downloads and upgrades they do not work in stereo only mono. I should have saved mylelf a lot of money and bought a wired pair. They are okay as far as comfort goes and mono is sufficinent for phone calls but as far as listening to music in the gym I will pass beacuse I will have to hear the gym's spreakers in my right ear and my own music in the left. Maybe they are only for Motorola phones and devices.
3,Cuts in and out when walking or running outside,"I purchased these stereo bluetooth headphones for use with my Blackberry Curve 8900.These headphones work well indoors with no problems with connectivity, however the story is quite different when I am outside with the Blackberry in my pocket...the reception cuts in and out to the point where its unusable. Holding the blackberry in my hand seems to improve the reception somewhat but that defeats the purpose.This is quite disappointing since I wanted to use these when I am out running so I am back to my wired headphones. I am not sure if this is due to the Blackberry or the headphones itself. There were some posts over in the Blackberry Forums that complain of this same problem."
3,MUSIC STREAMING WON'T WORK WITHOUT A2DP,"I had to give this product 3 stars because I couldn't really try them for music streaming (listen to music)If your phone does not have A2DP, this headset will not work for music streaming, it will only work for calls. I have the Cingular 2125, I bought this headset and a couple of days later it was on its way back to Amazon. So before you buy this item make sure your phone has A2DP. Amazon should really highlight this fact."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"THIS ITEM IS A WASTE OF MONEY,IT KEEP LOOSING SIGNAL I HAVENT USED IT FOR A ITS A DISASTER ONE OF THE WORST PRODUCT MOTOROLA HAVE MADE,FOR U TO HEAR THIS THING U HAVE TO HOLD YOUR PHONE UP TO THE EAR THE SIGNAL IS VERY WEEK,I AM NOT IMPRESS THE JABRA 3030 BT IS A BETTER BUY BY FAR AND U CAN CHANGE YOUR STEREO HEADSET WHENEVER U WANT....MOTOROLA THUMBS DOWN FOR THE S9"
3,Not powered off the iPod (a bad thing)...it's not a great bluetooth iPod solution but it works...,"Biggest problem: NOT POWERED OFF THE IPOD! Means you need yet another charger and have to remember to charge yet another item. That means 3 chargers to pack on vacation, and 3 battery sources that can be dead.I tried to pair this with my iPod video and as other readers have said... it doesn't stay plugged in (even while walking and having it in your pocket). It plugs in rather loosely and has ""play"" that makes you wonder WHEN it will bend the wrong way and break (leaving the connection stuck in the iPod).Also it's not built to last. The paint started scratching off on day 1, and it feels very cheaply built. It doesn't give you a clear indiciation of it turning off, so I've often left it on to find it drained when I was ready to use it."
2,It's for music in stereo.,It's not any good for phone use unless you don't care where the sound comes from. Left ear only for your phone. Useless to me.
2,OK for some things,"The headphones were great for listening to a phone conversation in the car, but not for talking and being heard by the person on the other end of the line. So, I returned them."
2,not grt,"Sound is OK at best. The ear piece does not fit into my ear, I can not put both ear pieces in at the same time if I jog, one will fall out."
3,Almost Fantastic!!! but dont lose the rubber ear cup,"Yes they sound really good....The volume control/ track select / play pause controls work okay...but kinda hard to locate which button is which (they are tiny and hard to feel) and you cant rest your head on a pillow or recline in a high back chair ...they will push off your ears.BUT>>>Mainly....****Heres my gripe...The rubber earcups (a replaceable item)IS NOT AVAILABLE TO BUY!!!!WTF???Im supposed to send it in for service when the rubber ear tip falls off and gets lost???I contacted Motorola directly and they said....""Send it in for service...the rubber tips are not available for sale"""
1,Poor sound,I was only able to get sound out of one ear peace and could not control the volume on the headset. The goal was to use it on a motorcycle using a Garmin Zumo 550 GPS along with XM radio. The ear inserts did not fit very well either.
3,beware - not for driving!,"Haven't tried this headset yet, but be aware that in California (and most other jurisdictions) you can't drive with both ears covered...[...]"
4,Very Nice,The headphones are comfortable and work nicely. It takes some time getting used to the button features to answer the phone. The one down side is that when on the phone the voice only comes through one ear.
2,Disappointed,The sound quality is good but the volume is far too low. The fast forward button stopped working within two weeks. I also purchased the Motorola PC850 bluetooth for my windows xp. Almost every time I try to pair them up the headphones cut off. Sometimes I just give up because i don't have time to sit around trying to pair them up for 30 minutes.
3,"Broke after 2 weeks - uncomfortable - good sound, easy connect","They were easy to pair, decent sound quality both calls and mp3 - but, they hurt my head and ears - and - I don't have a big head :-) And, they broke after a book was set on them - not slammed - just not very flexible IMO - and they don't fold. So, now I have a $70 pair of broken BT headphones."
2,So-So,"Looks great. Charges easily. Love that it's moisture resistant which is perfect for running and doing a lot of walking in various weather as I do. Also my sweat won't ruin it.BIG CON: Very, very twitchy in keeping connected to the phone. Basically if it's not in your back pocket, it's going to cut out a lot if you move your head too much, etc. I prefer keeping my phone in my front shirt pocket, but that doesn't work so well with this headset. Also, you can't very well sit down with your phone in your back pocket either (and then it doesn't connect well either because you are sitting on the phone). So really only works well if you are standing up and it's in your back pocket. All other uses are only so-so.Wish I hadn't bought it."
2,Not good if you wear glasses :(,Love the idea sounds great but the design is bad for people who wear glasses.
2,Needs Work,"Here are the cons:When receiving a phone call you hear the conversation in left ear only, The HT820 had dual speakers. I'm hearing impared in left ear and it is annoying and difficult to hear.Sometimes calls not answered when answer button is pushed.Units will suddenly skip track and go to next track, you get a beeping sound and suddenly your there, only happens intermittently. Unit seems to have a mind of its own and turns off, skips and has various annoying beeps.Battery life 4-5 hours maxPro: Light weight, durable. decent sound with music."
2,Close but no banana,"The quality of the sound is good, but these are a poor fit for my (average size) head and are quite inflexible. i did not like the construction and they were a bother during exercise moreso than any of my wires ever did so i sent them back."
3,Alright,They work perfectly well but they are very uncomfortable and if you wear them too long they hurt your ears.
3,miniUSB is not mini USB ?,"I bought this because it had a decent review, and a miniusb plug to charge with all my miniUSB devices while on the road. The beauty of standards..Well turns out it IS miniUSB but that ALL my other miniUSB chargers (that charge from cell phone all the way to lamps) are ""incompatible"" according to motorola.When I plug it into laptop or any other usb plug, it blinks green, and that's the last of it, with no charging involved..Motorola won't take it back, they insist it's a standard miniUSB plug but that ALL my chargers are incompatible, and all my usb to miniUSB plugs are crappy..seems something is fishy here.. is this just a way to sell you more moto chargers that are supposed to be standards ?"
2,So close and yet so far.....,"The range of bluetooth technology says you have a range of up to 30 feet from the source. I have an iPhone 3Gs. This headset is about useless unless you have it positioned a MAXIMUM of 18 inches away. Soooooooooooo, in f your goal was to watch You Tube videos or movies or any type of video on your iPhone, stay way the heck away from these headphones. You can listen to your mp3's on your iPhone 3Gs if you have it positioned in your shirt pocket. That's right, shirt pocket. Forget about having the iPhone on the dash, car seat or console. The music definitely cuts in and out at an incredibly annoying rate. It's not terribly comfortable to wear either. My opinion? Logitech makes an awesome over the ears set of bluetooth headphones. The Logitech FreePulse. Get them instead of these."
1,Bluetooth fades in and out,"Device is very light in weight but still uncomfortable to wear. The bluetooth interface cuts out so frequently this device is not useful for phone calls while driving, or for listening to music.Most cut outs are eliminated if you are sitting in a chair and not moving your head or your phone. And if you are going to sit in a chair to listen to music, why listen to lo-fi MP3's on a phone?"
2,Didn't work well for me,"I have been looking for a good bluetooth stereo headset that would work well for my workouts at the gym. This headset seemed like the answer and exactly what I needed. The problem was that I could not ever get the headset to feel comfortable in my ears. I adjusted and adjusted and no good. One day my left ear would hurt, then the next day my right ear would hurt. The instruction manual said the ears could be adjusted for a better fit, but I could not seem to figure out how to make them adjust. Back to Amazon for a refund. I will continue to search for a good headset."
2,Does not work properly with iPhone 4,"I loved this product with my Blackberry but it does not work properly consistently with the iPhone 4, it changes songs in the iPod and cuts off when someone calls you. I sent back told I would get a full refund and find out they are instead sending me another..No thanks.. It will also be returned."
2,Battery has a Very Short Life...,"Headphones worked pretty well for past year but now the battery life has dropped from many hours to only a few minutes. Apparently they all suffer from this condition so they really only last about a year or so, then the solution from Motorola and Best Buy is to throw them away and buy another set. There is no battery replacement procedure and Motorola doesn't seem to acknowledge the problem. For 100.00 plus headphones, they should be serviceable but they absolutely Are Not..."
1,Not for sport,"I got the S9 for sport, to work out and go running in. It did a great job for working out with weights. However, once I started spending more time running, i.e sweating more, volume control started hanging up. In addition, don't depend on it for talking for more than 1 minutes. You are not very audible. I would not buy this item, waste of money. I called Motorola for help twice. Tech guys never call back. Disappointed in Motorola."
2,POOR BATTERY PERFORMANCE !!,I bought my unit from MERRYFINE.com for $16. I actually tested it out and ran it on a fully charged battery with continuous music playing plus the distance between the device and player was inches. It ran for no more than 2.5 hours. It is rated for 6 hours of stereo music listening !!! That kind of difference in actual vs. advertised is unacceptable !!!!
1,Bad reception and just stopped working one day.,I brought this item to use during my training rides on my road bike. It fades in and out all the time and one day just stopped working and hasn't worked since. I only had the headset for less than two mouths before this happened. Not worth the time and money stick with headphones.
2,Don't last,I bought these headphones less than a year ago and used them a few times a week. Less than a year later the sound cuts in and out while listen to music running. I bought a different brand and they worked fine so I know it was not my media device. I would definitely not recommend these headphones they do not last.
2,"Nice design, not waterproof.","A very elegant design that certainly looks and sounds the part, however, the headset is absolutely not water resistant. I got a pair for Christmas to use while running on a treadmill. They lasted for four workout sessions before the volume control buttons shorted out and stopped working. After searching online, I found that a lot of people are having the same problem. If you use this headset in any environment where they might come into contact with moisture, they will fail within a short period of time. Do not buy these if you plan to use them in any sort of ""active"" capacity.I have just returned the headset to Motorola. I have read about guys who are on their 6th and 7th replacement headset in only a few months. I don't intend to be one of those guys.Motorola, why can't you seal the electronics in this headset properly?? It's a nice product. Make it properly and you might even sell more of these."
2,Not for people with glasses,"It just didn't fit right around my glasses. The headphones are supposed to be bendy/adjustable... and I made them fit right--temporarily. Any head movement and at least one of the earbuds would come out of the ear. Plus, using it at the gym was even worse. I found myself constantly fidgetting with it to try to make it fit correctly. I've also had complaints of people not hearing me well during calls. In summary, super cool looking... but just didn't work out for me."
2,Very limited range!,Bluetooth connections are supposed to reach 30 feet right? Not with the S9. When fully charged I can get about 10 feet of range. After about an hour of usage I get disruptions when the headphones are further than 2 feet away! I wear my cell phone on my belt and cannot get the headphones to keep a connection. This product is nowhere near as reliable as the older Motorola headphones.They are comfortable though... and plenty loud enough.
2,Not Sweat Resistant,Worked great for about 3 weeks but I think sweat got into them and they stopped working and will no longer even charge. The pause & skip buttons never worked when sinked with my IPod. I wouldn't wast my money until they can get their issues resolved. Motorola is sending me a new pair but I have to ship back the old pair at my expense.
3,"Works well, but can be difficult to wear","I bought this headset about a month ago to listen to MP3s on my Blackberry. It works well and gets rid of the issue of wires and so forth. I also use its telephone function. I would give this five stars, but the issue I continually have is the shape of this thing. I live in New England you have to wear bulky things in the winter and the back of this headset hangs so low that it gets snagged by my clothes. I really wish there was a version that goes over your head rather than behind."
2,Good sound but poor connectivity and battery life,"I purshased these to use with my iPod when out running. Quality is very good but there are some concerns:1: Moto states that battery will drain more quickly in time to the point where it must be replaced --However it is not possible to replace the battery so once it goes bad you must discard the 80$ ear phones(!)2.) Battery life is quite poor so expect to recharge them a couple of times daily.3.) If like me you are looking to have them when exercising, understand that they are very sensitive to interference and will often cut the sound. I have my iPod attached to my upper arm just less than a feet from my ears and I still have problems. Having it in your jeans pockets or even in your chest pocket is a big no-no: You either hold it in your hand or you put it on your upper arm: obviously this does not deliver the benefits of going cordless..."
5,No wires is fantastic...,Great product! I've been looking for this kind of mobile technology at this price for a long time. Clearity is good and functionally does what it says it can do.
4,Nice wireless headphones,These headphones are great when you are working out. My wife uses them at the gym and they are perfect. They sit up off your neck so they don't bounce around and they sound great.
3,Great stereo headphones! Poor cell phone headset!,The stereo bluetooth headphones works great with my Razr2 and my SONY HWS-BTA2W transmitter/receiver. What it does not do well is the Headset function. People that I am talking to through them get fustrated and want to hang up as fast as possible. The headset quality is about as poor as it gets for a headset. I think Motorola was just trying to push this iteam on the Market fast. But if you are looking for sporty behind-the-neck stereo headphones they are great.
2,Motorola S9 Stereo Bluetooth Headset,"Sound quality is not very good. Lots of complaints of echo and speakerphone effect. Also, no stereo for phone calls."
1,Not for working out,"Great concept, too bad it doesn't work while exercising. Purchased this for my husband to use while running but we've had to send it back twice in 6 months b/c the buttons stop working -- we assume it's because of sweat but cannot confirm.I'm sure this is a great product if you're sedentary."
2,"Great concept, poor application","I love these headphones because they are one of the better designed stereo bluetooth headphones out there, small, lightweight, and discreet. Now for the bad news: they tend to fail after moisture gets inside of them. The buttons on the side stop working soon after you complete a workout. This is a sad truth about them, as they are ideal for exercise. I have owned 2 and they both failed the same way, so I am very familiar with their shortcomings. Overall, they work and sound good, but beware about using them during any activity that may induce sweat, as they can be very fragile in that regard. If you end up buying these and use them during such activities, dry them frequently and immediately."
2,"Bad with your phone, good with your computer.","I gave up trying to use this Headphone with my HTC TytnII PDA phone in my pants' pocket. It has so much interference, that the audio is on-and-off every 2 seconds. Useless.However it works with my computer, at very close range.All other bluetooth devices I tried with my phone have worked perfectly. This one doesn't. The range probably gets reduced due to the audio being stereo...???? (just gessing)."
4,"Use all the time, satisfied","Great connection, great phone, great sound. Fit is a little tight for my big melon and my ears are a little sore after a few hours because of this but I like them enough that I dont care. I'm a mechanic and wear them at work while I'm in and out of cars all day and just plain forget they are there. Jogging is great with them too! Have read in reviews that the mic is too sensitive to use with ambient noise but in this noisy shop I have never had a caller complain. The big earbuds are the most comfortable to me but they dont stay on the phones well for some reason, and I lost one :("
1,"Great Concept, poor execution --- unfortunately","I purchased this headset for use with a new cell phone. It worked great until I tried to exercise with it. During my second work out, the volume control reduced the volume until I could no longer hear the output. The volume could not be returned to normal.I returned the device to Verizon and received a new S9 thinking that I had just had bad luck. But the same thing happened a second time, after only one workout. I can think of no other cause for these failures than moisture intrusion into the electronics (perpiration in through the earphone). Anyone who claims that this product is sweat resistant has not thoroughly tested the product.If you decide to buy this product, check the return policy definitely. If you work out enough to break a sweat, there is a fair chance that the headset will stop working, requiring you to make another purchase."
1,listen to me: Save your Money!,"I read the other reviews, and thought I would still get these headphones...huge mistake!I had these headphones for 2 days and ran a total of 12 miles before the problems made them inoperable.Inside the headphones did work great, but outdoors they are totally worthless! You have to keep your phone well within arm's reach to prevent garbled sound from the headphones. Completely ridiculous that the indoor range is 30 ft, and will work through concrete walls, yet outdoors it can't work at distances approaching 2 feet. It was so frustrating I went back to wired headphones.Another problem also occurred: as mentioned by others, the 'volume down' button began activating and could not be stopped, making the sound too low to hear.Finally, the headphones would not work with my Bluetooth equipped Lenovo laptop.A horrible, horrible product, that I regret having purchased. Please don't make the same mistake! Wait until Motorola releases a functional wireless headphone!"
3,"good, but could be better.","bluetooth: fairly consistent signal... blinks out every now and then when in a heavily fortified structure.sound: good, but due to poor ear buds, the sound escapes easily. bass is also a bit too low.comfort: i would much rather have the device hug the back of my head than to have it rest on my neck. not good for collared shirts. the ear buds suck, and the speakers direction should be into your ear (panned forward), not straight. should come with optional types of ear buds (e.g. the snug ones that fit into your ear so that sound doesn't escape)overall: i'm glad i only paid $35 and not the full price of $55. maybe if i can find some better replacement buds than what they offer, i'll be more pleased. who tested this device before they released it?"
2,does not function properly,"I received the item, however, it does not function properly. I have an iphone 4. It will not skip to the next song as advertised. It just beeps and doesn't forward to the next song. The volume controls work."
2,Useless outdoors,"I don't understand. In the gym, these work perfectly, and the sound quality is great. The minute I walk outside the gym, and anywhere else for that matter, the audio cuts out for 2-3 seconds at a time. I tried them with a moto q, and the iphone v3. Mind boggling that motorola hasn't fixed this problem. What good are they if I can't use them while going for a walk outside...and also, the buttons don't work on the iphone, but I think that's an iphone issue"
2,Horrible for the Iphone 3G-S.,I bought these for my Iphone 3g S. They are great when they stay connected. They dropped connection all the time. That should be review enough for you.
2,Bad luck with product but vendor fair,"I received my original order, Motorola Bluetooth headset within 7 business days after ordering. It did not work at all, the battery wouldn't work after about 2 minutes of use. I sent it back to vendor at my cost and received another unit, which did the same, battery would die right away. I returned this second unit for a refund and would now only consider trying another unit if from a local store."
2,Original stereo BT headset,"This is my first Bluetooth stereo headset. It came with such high hopes. The sound quality was great, but the annoying item upon the back of the neck became too burdensome.I have since upgraded to a new one & relegated this to the junk drawer."
1,"Malo, no lo compres.","Compre estos audifonos y funcionaban de manera perfecta con mi teléfono celular Samsumg Omnia, estaba muy satisfecho por la facilidad de conección y por la calidad de audio. Sin embargo, me fui con ellos a un paseo y lo use bajo una muy leve llovizna, cinco minutos después no funcionaba el botón de ""play"", nunca lo volvió a hacer. Leí algunos reseñas sobre el producto y hablan sobre lo poco resistente que es a la humedad. Si quiere audifonos para usar hasta que llueve y sudes un poco, compra estos, si quieres algo de calidad mejor no."
3,headphones,"I love the fit and ability to change songs, volume on the headset, but.... it drops signal from the bluetooth adapter easily (I use it with a IPOD Nano) and its a hassle to keep reconnecting it while working out. I had a logitech that had a designated adapter which worked better but the headset style was not desirable. It works good. Sounds great. Maybe I just need to get better at using it."
4,Motorola MOTOROKR S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones,"My first Bluetooth device and I'm mostly happy with the purchase. A few things to note:1. It would be great if these things would bend a bit to fit your head and ear position...ya know, like eyeglasses. They are, in essence the same shape, worn backward.2. Since this is a stereo unit, but only stereo for music (phone is just in the right earpiece), a bit more volume would be nice. I wear mine while walking and some of the MP3s I've uploaded to my phone are simply not loud enough, most are though.What I like about this device:1. Very intuitive LED confirms that it is turning ON or OFF and when it's ACTIVE.2. The first time I spoke to it in phone mode, it knew who I wanted to call! If it doesn't understand, it tries to be helpful (and usually succeeds).3. It seem like it will last. Seems pretty well made."
1,motorola S9 bluetooth active,"This item performed very poorly, it constantly breaks-up while riding on my bicycle while listening. The Motorola HT 820 has much better performance."
2,Do not buy until Motorola admits to and fixes the buttons that stop working,"I have had my S9 for about 2 months now. I love it for the gym. Problem is the up volume button stopped functioning. After doing some online research, this appears to be a relatively wide spread problem and it appears that Motorola has not fixed the problem in the newer S9-HD unit. Same problems being reported. Good headset when the buttons are working properly but I would not buy another one."
2,WILL NOT TOLERATE SWEAT,"I've had two of the S9s. Both have shorted out due to sweating in the gym and while running. Motorola and Amazon BOTH will not support the return or exchange of this item. Do your research and GOOGLE this item in various forums. If you don't sweat its great. Sounds goods, fits good, goes on and off easily...even the phone features work well. But it will NOT tolerate sweat or any moisture (rain).Been using the JayBirds for awhile now and they WILL tolerate sweat, but they don't go on as easily and the earpieces don't fit as well as the S9.Still waiting for the ultimate athletic headphone..... Good Luck"
1,Don't buy this headset!,"I was profoundly disappointed with this headset. It seemed perfect until I had been running for about 3 minutes. Then, apparently, my perspiration caused it to malfunction and stop working entirely, making it useless. After the fact, I looked on the web and saw that MANY MANY other customers have had this exact problem. I contacted Motorola but they were not helpful. I contacted the Amazon merchant and they refused initially to give me a refund (until I contacted the BBB). Amazon, however, was extremely helpful and refunded my money (although they were not the seller and had no obligation). Kudos to Amazon! Shame on Motorola for selling this defective product!"
1,Customer Service????,"I received the headset and tried to sync it with the device I planned on using it with. No success. I called the company CCMAccessories in Woodside, NY who is the Amazon merchant for this product. I was told that I would be sent out another pair plus a prepaid label to return the defective one. This never occurred. I then called back about two weeks later and told a gentleman named Louis that I had never received the headset and I wished to return the defective one and just be credited for the purchase. As of Monday November 30th, this has not happened. Let me say that this is the first time I have purchased something from Amazon and had this problem"
2,Not sweat proof,"Bought this pair of headphones because they marketed it towards people who work out. It was easy to use with a cell phone and the controls for the volume and fast forward/rewind are in a good place to access them. However, when I used it for a running workout and sweated it ceased to work. I wouldn't recommend this for someone that wants it for cardio. I guess they changed it to sweat ""resistant,"" but that is like saying my car is collision resistant until you hit it."
2,Would be great if it worked...,"Not much to say here. Got it out of the box. Paired easily. Worked a few times and then would no longer change the volume on the headset. I suspect a short. Regardless, it's not saying much for a product when it stops working after less than two weeks and barely an hours worth of usage. I wonder if Motorola just doesn't make a good product anymore. It sure would be great to have a working headset."
1,Don't buy these!!!,"Fantastic while they work. My first pair lasted about 3 weeks before the volumn controls got stuck decreasing. Sent them to Motorola and the second pair lasted a week. Same issue. I'm about to send these back and try a third pair. Read other reviews, this is apparently very common. I haven't read many positive reviews where the author owned these more than a couple of months. Three strikes and they're out.There's a lemon law in the USA to protect customers against companies like Motorola."
2,Volume problem,"I would give these a 10 when they work however the majority of the time the volume gets stuck on low. Then out of the blue the volume goes up and down on their own. Motorola is no help. Can never get an answer out of them. Of coarse someone new responds ea time and never reads the previous info. You would think that with all the complaints on volume control they would post some trouble shooting advice. One tells me to resink it. I ask how. Another responds contact Apple because I am linked to my Ipod. Excuse me but it is the headset that is not working. I have it linked to a couple different devices and it is the same with each one of them. These were a gift and the giver got rid of the receipt. I am stuck with them... working or not. I have only had them since Easter of 08. Again they are great... when they work. Sincerely, Sherri"
1,DONT BUY THEM,"I BOUGHT THESE HEADPHONES SO I COULD WORK OUT AND LISTEN TO MY MUSIC WITH OUT THE ANNOYING CORDS. I USED THEM FOR A LITTLE OVER A WEEK AND THEY BEGAN TO MALFUNCTION THE BUTTONS WERENT WORKING ITS LIKE SWEAT GOT INTO THE HEADPHONES AND CAUSED THEM TO MESS UP. I MEAN IF THEY ARE SPORTS HEADPHONES SHOULDNT THEY BE WATER PROOF? I AM VERY PISSESD BECAUSE I AM IN IRAQ AND IT TOOK ME FOREVER TO GET THESE OUT HERE. DONT BUY THIS TRASH GET SOMETHING ELSE I AM TRYING TO GET MINE REPLACED, FOR NOW IM BACK TO THE EFFIN CORDS."
2,"Decent quality, small size","While this headset pairs as expected and charges quickly, I found the sound quality to be only adequate. Battery life seems to be quite good considering the size of the cell. What--however--was this product's failing for me was the non-adjustable width of the headset; it is narrow enough that it pinched my head and caused headaches. If you don't have a narrow bean, look elsewhere for your A2DP action."
1,Works great while it works,"I'm on S9 #3. My first unit worked perfectly for 3 months or so until the control buttons quit working properly, and instead the unit would skip tracks or adjust the volume randomly on it's own.Contacted Motorola support, which in itself was a bit of a hassle over the phone (I'd recommend dealing with Motorola via the web / email if possible). But once I finally got ahold of the correct person, they didn't question the replacement - which makes me think this is a common problem.Unit #2 was sent out. It worked fine for about a week. Then the same problem started happening again. Replied to my original ticket, got an RMA number and am now getting a 3rd unit.Have had to pay return shipping both times, and am beginning to be frustrated with the situation. Hoping this unit will hold up, but I expect that because I use this unit when working out, somehow moisture gets into the controls somehow and is what causes it to fail.We'll see how long unit #3 lasts."
3,Would be great if the quality was there.,"I could love the s9's but unfortunately I am on my 2nd pair and may have to warranty these out because the green light is stuck on. The sound on these bad boys is great! And the mic works good to for phone calls. But apparently they are not built very well and the sports looks are really more a gimmick, most people who give them a serious sweating, tend to have control problems(my first set the play controls did not work). This set has been great up until yesterday the green light is stuck and i am waiting for it to power down in hopes i can reset it. The problem is there are not a lot of choices and these sound good. So we shall see what tomorrow brings hopefully not another warranty repair."
2,Working great - not,"Original review was ""So far, these are working great. I wear them at the gym while doing cardio. I keep my hair up in a high ponytail, so they haven't gotten seriously wet. My friend at the gym has a set too and is happy with hers."" Well, So Far was the operative phrase. Had to replace them three times ... as soon as you sweat on them, they short out. I'm now using Jaybirds."
4,Great gift!,"Got the headphones for the husband, he really loves them. Being on the other end, I can say the head phones pick up all the noise around him which is a bit bothersome. Other than that, it is a great gift and a good product..."
1,It kinda works,"Don't expect to wear the S9 headphones while working out. Sweat gets into the earpieces and shorts out the controls. The headset worked for me for a couple weeks before it started breaking down. After about a month, it completely stopped working.Second, the audio quality was never very good.The battery only ever lasted about 6 hours, which would be fine if I could carry an extra battery. As it is, the batter is built-in."
2,worked great for 6 weeks,"This product worked great for the first 6 weeks, although the pause/play buttons and the track skip fwd/bkwd don't work for the iPhone. After six weeks the volume control button as well as the phone answer/hang up button stoped working for some unknown reason."
2,Buttons stopped working,"None of the buttons worked on the first pair I got and sound only came out of one speaker. The replacement worked well for a day, but the volume up button stopped working after that. I was told that I could not get a third replacement, I was willing to try one more set, but now I think I will try the S9-HD as it looks like the buttons on it are actually buttons and not just touch sensitive buttons that stop working. They did pair easily with my iPhone 3G with the 3.0 OS update, but the track foward and back and pause buttons never seemed to work, but I think this is a known issue. I was surprised that calls worked well, I could not see the mic at all, but people said they could hear me just fine."
4,cool,I've had it 3 weeks and it works great except it won't be good for runners because bouncing it around causes gaps in the transmission
3,S9 Bluetooth Active Headphones,"These headphones fit great as long as my head is straight and I am looking level. If I look down or up, especially up, they dig into the back of my neck and are not comfortable. They stay on well but I bought them to use while in the gym and when I look up when using the weight machines they dig into the back of my neck."
3,Motorola S9.,"Fantastic Bluetooth, clear Audio.Good Seller & fast responde.Bad think they mentioned Red/Black but i got Black only no red line.both are the same :) mabe next time i'll order it for my friends."
4,OMG... a sweaty runner's dream!,"I have been on a mission to find a pair of headphones that dont wiggle loose when i go for a run. My search is over. I can run with it comfortably and workout, plus no wires to snag by accident.One thing i noticed is that i cant use the small buds. When i get sweaty, the sweat will run into my ear and go directly to the speakers, almost into them. So i used the included big buds. These will keep sweat away from the speakers. if you dont get super sweaty then the small buds will work fine for you.Second thing i noticed is that there is a little distortion on music that has has cymbals. but its very minor and i didnt expect studio quality sound even tho it is close to it. the sound has great low end! i have also hated other earphones that dont give me any bass. this one has amazing bass on it!the bluetooth is amazing too! it sounds better that any other blue tooth i have tried!if you want my opinion if you should get these, its YES!"
2,Started out great....,"I really enjoyed my Moto Rokr s9's for the first week. Then the touch buttons to turn the sound up and down stopped working. Then the move 1 song back button stopped working. Then today the volume, which I can't control via the buttons on its own went down while I was wearing them without me doing anything. And I can't get the volume back up because the buttons stopped working. Fortunately Amazon is sending me a replacement, but I am expecting better quality out of these. If not I will lower my rating to zero stars."
1,Not worth it!!!!,"I purchased this for use with my Ipod Classic and my Blackberry Curve. Getting it to pair was the easy part. What was most problematic is that unless the Bluetooth Adapter D650 for the Ipod was within a line of sight of the headphones, the music cut in and out. Very disappointing. Even having the ipod in my front pocket while wearing the headset, I experienced problems with a steady stream of music. After 15 minutes, I decided I could live with the hassle of a corded pair of earbuds without bluetooth stream interruption!"
1,Awesome ... When It Works,"I really enjoyed these headphones until they stopped working.The design is stylish and minimalist and the sound quality rivals that of wired headsets. I'm very active, so I want a headset that I can use to listen to tunes while working out or running. I connected these to my cell phone for music and calls.After about a week of taking these everywhere, the volume turned itself all the way down and the buttons stopped working. This rendered the headphones useless. My joy at having found such a cool product turned into disappointment as I read about the similar experiences of others. Apparently this is a somewhat common occurence with these. I returned my Motorola MOTOROKR S9 bluetooth headphones for a refund.Motorola needs to take responsibility for this defect and issue a recall. Until then, I can not recommend this product. I suggest shopping around for products from other manufacturers."
2,Horrible product,"I haven't even expected Motorola product is going to be this much worse. I really had a bad experience with this product.1. Voice is just okie.. I felt like a hearing a stereo 10 years back recorded voice.2. I can able to hear only in left ear when I am attending phone call, I don't know this is simply silly. I am having another Jabra BT620, this item is superb but only problem is it is little bulkier..3. The product is not at all comfortable for wearing.4. I attended phone call with 10 minutes duration I got pain at my ears. With Jabra 620 I use to attend offshore conference calls in the night around 30 to 60 minutes I never had such kind of bad experience.Finally I returned item, haven't left with any other choice."
1,So much potential...so many problems,"These headphones have the potential to be the only pair you will ever need to workout in. I was falling in love! But, they fail too early and often.Easy to pair up, volume controls are touch, answer calls, pause, fast forward, comfortable in the ears, it has it all.But...The volume controls stopped working after the first 2 weeks. If you look around, this is a common problem.Also, it skips like mad. Nothing will make you want to chuck these in the trash more than being in the middle of a workout and the volume doesnt respond, and the music skips more than a CD.Bottom line?Wait for the second generation S9."
2,chopping music,"I purchase this bluetooth headphone to listen to music off my motorola cell phone. It would worked sometimes,but most of the time it was choppy and very irritating. I thought maybe I had a defected bluetooth, so I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement. The new one did the same thing. I tried to make it work, maybe recharging it after each use, but it would work at first, maybe an hour, and then it became chopping again. I would also start up the phone part which worked fine, and then start up the music. That worked at first, but once again the music became choppy. I called Motorola's help line, and they gave me suggestion that were no help. So I sent it back for a refund. You would think a Motorola headphone would work on a Motorola phone. I would understand maybe if it was two different brands. Good luck getting yours to work if you decide to purchase it."
3,Love it - and really wish it worked,"Apparently the sweat/water resistance is badly oversold. I like everything else about the design - the fit, the sound, the light weight - it is exactly what I've been looking for in a set of headphones.But on the first long run with these, they got wet on the outside with sweat, and now the side controls are mostly unresponsive.When used for a phone call, the sound quality is great in a quiet area. But the mic picks up other sounds very well, so it's hard to use in a room or car with any other noise."
4,"Good for listening to music, but not for talking on the phone",overall it works good. I wish the rubber for the ear pieces was softer. The controls work good. My only real complaint is people tell me the sound quality is poor when talking to them.
5,Great headset!,"This headset is a must for iPod/MP3 users! I have wireless controllers for my game consoles, but I didn't really think to go wireless with my iPod, and if I had, I prob wouldn't have gone Bluetooth as iPod isn't bluetooth enabled. BUT when my wife got me these for my birthday I was amazingly surprised, with an iPod adapter it works great, no more wires, no more having to take off my headphones to take off (or put on) my backpack, just amazing. Also it pauses my ipod when a call comes in, and I can take the call over the headphones. Well worth it! So light and easy to wear! And you can pair them to 9 devices!"
2,Uncomfortable on my Neil Cavuto-like head,"I bought these locally-on sale-retail, and returned them the next day, which was a wise decision for me. The sides of the headphones, even with adjustment (pulling them apart as instructed) were uncomfortable on my Neil Cavuto-like head, especially with my glasses adding to the mix. My ear canal openings also hurt after a short time; tried both earpieces. Tilting my head upward made them even more uncomfortable; not good if I was biking. I will stay wired for now. I'll give them 2 stars only because of the cool look and leap in technology."
2,Good Product. Not So Good Seller.,Shipping took a long time. Product was a bit beat up due to inadequate packing on the sellers end. Would use this seller again with caution!
4,"Motorokr S9, runner's headset",Great headset! Comfortable. Good quality sound. My main issue is the control buttons--WAY too sensitive! By the time I 'braille' around to figure out how to skip to the next track I have skip through an entire album of tracks. Still the best A2DP headset that I have found to use while running.
1,awful,"No wonder Motorola is tanking. These phones are hard and hurt the ears and do not work with most bluetooth sets, even those made by Motorola!!!"
1,"High price, cheap product","Avoid these headphones at all costs. With less than 2 weeks of wear, my headphone's volume controls now do not work and the headset automatically skips ""back"" to the previous track - constantly - so no music can be played.Outside, the reception is poor, and the only place my cellphone can be placed in order to connect with the headset is directly in the middle of my lower back - somewhat less than an ideal place.My headset will be returned ASAP."
2,Does not work Outdoors!,"Outdoor Use: 0 out of 5 StarsIndoor Use: 4 out of 5 StarsOverall Rating: 2 out of 5 Stars.Although I gave this product 2 out of 5, I am actually quite happy with it. I use these headphones with my phone on my daily bus commute, and they do exactly what I wanted them to do.However as soon as I step off the bus, the audio starts dropping, songs become choppy, basically unworkable.If you are looking at these for primarily indoor use, go ahead, they are great. If you want to use outdoors, run screaming from them."
5,Marylands forgotten history,"As a arm chair history buff, I found this book well researched and written with plenty of back up notes. Written by a Johns Hopkins Faculty member lends it credit as well. The victor always writes history and sadly, Marylands history is slanted towards the northern view which is at odds with the facts. Had Maryland not been invaded, she would have left the union to join her sister states of the south. Thousands of her residents and politicians were seized by the northern troops and sent to prisons up north, the free press closed and personal property confiscated- all without warrants. Members of Francis Scott Keyes family were amoung those locked up. The Constitution and Bill of Rights were trampled asunder by the federal government and President Lincoln. Sadly, the government we have today is not the one established by our founding fathers but is a product of the military might of the northern states and their economic/political desires."
3,Well written but only of one opinion,"Mr Denton fails to take in many factors that of Lincoln not wanting MD not falling into the Confederacy such as the Port of Baltimore, and its central rail hub with connections to the west. The book also fails to mention that If MD fell to the Confederacy it would put Washington DC behind Confederate lines. There are some other facts left out that Mr Denton chooses to leave un-noticed. His main concern is the Election of 1860 and its effect on MD."
3,Product works - shipping issue,Had an initial problem with the shipping as the product didn't arrive at all. Contacted seller and after a few days of emails they sent a new one via fedex.
3,Excellent writing but wildly unreliable,"Be forewarned: Jonathan Gold's culinary prose is compelling reading, but any attempts to use this as an actual guidebook for restaurants in Los Angeles should be heavily researched first. Perhaps I just have extraordinarily bad luck, but each time I've tried to visit one of the restaurants, something's gone wrong. Aladdin Falafel (p. 2) no longer exists, though its sign is still up there on the corner mini-mall placard. India's Tandoori (p. 137) no longer serves Tandoori pizza, so temptingly describe in Rich's essay. Gagnier's Creole Kitchen (p. 109) in Santa Monica disappeared years ago. With that said, I would still recommend the book as a fun read for those who enjoy learning more about the culinary diversity available in Los Angeles."
4,Great book!!!!!!!!!!! Only one complaint...,"The only thing I didn't like about this book is that the organization of the index is only by style of food (Tawainese, Cuban, Mexican, etc)...hence only 4 stars. But the descriptions of food are excellent! Since it's 2007 now the content is a little outdated and some restaurants are no longer there. Make sure you check if the restaurant is still there before driving to it."
4,Finally a TRUE guide to the foods of LA!,"Jonathan Gold appreciates one of the main benefits of LA-- all the ethnic enclaves with their respective specialized cuisines. As an angeleno, I love the cultural diversity, and I love it even more now with Mr. Gold's guide to eat my way through all the different restaurants. Thank you, Mr. Gold!Other mainstream guides like Zagat neglect to mention the really great ethnic places, probably because their reviewers don't know about those places. So if you have an adventurous palate, look for an ""A"" sign (the grade given to the restaurant by the health dept.) in the window and follow Mr. Gold's book."
3,This book was written 12 years ago,"I bought this book for my husband since he is a foodie. He loves reading for hours about restaurants, foods and menu. He then likes to surprise us taking our family to the most amazing cuisine around. Since J. Gold no longer publishes at LA Weekly, I bought this book for my husband thinking that I would benefit a lot from it. Well, this book was written 12 years ago, so that many of the restaurants are now closed and no longer exist. He loved the book, though. He loves reading how things were 12 years ago, when he was growing up and going to those restaurants here around LA, and how the menu and things have changed..."
1,too many typos !,the worst job of proofreading i have ever seen easily 10 typos per page.. the book itself iswell written
4,Great Supplement for d20 Future,"I GM a d20 Future game and this book just arrived on my doorstep. I spent about 10 minutes perusing the book and found at least 20 ways to spice up my campaign just from that preliminary browse. And this is supposed to be a player supplement! By no means is this book essential for your campaign, but it will save you the time and effort of making this crap up on your own (e.g., this book is full of new gear, cybernetics, occupations, feats, skill applications, prestige classes, and much, much more).If you GM a d20 Future campaign or are a player in a d20 Future campaign, I recommend that you purchase this item. You will not be sorry."
5,Great kickstand,"This is a great kickstand. If you load down your bike, then you really need a two leg kickstand. There are cheaper models, and they may be fine- I haven't tried them. I have installed this device and am very pleased. It is reasonably light (alloy), but very sturdy. What else can I say? It's only a kickstand, but it is a great kickstand."
5,ESGE Two-Leg Kickstand 320mm Silver,"Not much to say Simplistic, fit perfect, easy to put on.I nit pick so I filled the right leg to get it perfectly level.Works great when carrying a top heavy load and or windy days. Both my friends bicycles feel over in the wind mine did not."
5,Kickstand for Cycle Genius Falcon LWB recumbent,"I bought this kickstand for [...] LWB (long-wheel-base) recumbent bicycle, since with a regular kickstand it would fall from wind, uneven surface, or for no reason at all. 320 mm kickstand was too long for my bicycle, so I had to cut it to 275mm. Legs of the stand are marked in 10 mm increments, so cutting is very easy. Actual installation on the bike was sub 5 min. I have been using the stand for a week now, and it is incredible: my very long bike with 2 panniers doesn't fall even on the grass. I cut the kickstand so that the rear wheel is about 1/4 inch above the ground, so I can spin pedals forward. This allows me to use the kickstand as a bike stand for the chain maintenance and rear derailleur adjustment. I should have bought this stand many years ago."
4,Quality kickstand,"The kickstand works as described. Easy to install (just need an allen key to tighten) even if you don't have the mounting hardware on your bike frame for kickstands. If you're concerned about getting possible scratches on the flawless paint work on your bike, get the deluxe mounting kit with the rubber padding. Not to say that this stand leaves scratches - my bike is not flawless, so I never bothered to check if installing the stand left scratches. The stand is quite long though, perhaps meant for all bikes up to a very large size. Without cutting the stand down to the right height, my bike's rear wheel was a good 6 inches above the ground (my bike's a 51). Got a few inches chopped off the ends (follow the markings) and it's perfect now."
5,Awesome!,"This is an excellent way to stay in shape. I've tried it and it works! I commend the author for such an innovative and extremely easy way to jump rope and stay fit. Everyone should read this book. It's the best I've seen out there. Do yourself a favor -- buy this book, you will not be sorry."
3,A little surprising,"The book that arrived (as a gift) was a small spiral bound pamphlet that appears to be self-published. No one would have thought it should cost more than $8-$10. And there seems to be a religious/spiritual content; for example, there are quotes from ""The Daily Word"", The Holy Bible, as well as ""Tao Te Ching""."
3,good if you like Jefferey Donovan,"Jefferey Donovan of Burn Notice is helping a start up interenet company get financial backing. There are a lot of sexual refrences and use of drugs. It has a slight moral of 'be careful what you wish for' but it mostly comes across that the ends justify the means. I only recommend this movie if you really love Jefferey Donovan, and if you do you should try Believe In Me."
4,This Time the World,"Rockwell was a genius, and it was good to read his story. We should miss him. Sadly, the critics will never tell the truth about him."
4,Rave review for the Mathis Sisters,"Mixed Emotions is Raquel Eldridge's debut novel about two sisters, Emily and Skylar, journey into womanhood. It begins with the oldest sister, Emily, graduating from high school, and the sisters taking their first ""adult"" trip to Santa Monica. The author walks us, the readers, through their lives with all the twists and turns that growing up can throw one. I laughed, cried, cheered, and screamed the girls on through the parts of life that everyone can relate to. As in true life, some of the decisions that the sisters make are not the best, but the beauty is how they pull together to make it through. This book will make you love to read about the Mathis sisters, and will make you appreciate your bonds with your sister/friends."
4,we should buy books through amazon.,"fast shipping with the best quality. However, people should not use one click check out, otherwise people have to pay for shipping even you are qualified for free shipping."
4,"A very good movie, I thought!","Even though the reviewers did not like this movie, I myself enjoyed it immensely. I think that others will like it as well. I never really listen to movie critics, since they have an opinion just like I do. I would definitely reccommend this movie."
5,A Great Movie,"This is a great movie. I thought the acting was fantastic and the heroic character of Omar El-muktar is well documented in history books (e.g., The Sunusi of Cyrenica, Oxford University, 1949). This movie was intended as a documentation of a hero's life; it was never meant to generate revenue! The release of the movie was limited, especially in N. America, due to the current unfavorable image of Libya in the west and to protest and pressure from Italian communities, which explains the low revenue mentioned in the editorial. Even today in Canada good luck finding this movie in your neighborhood video store. Forget editorials. You will love this movie!"
3,25th Anniversary set is a Disappointing repackaging of film epic.,"You may want to hold on to your non-anamorphic original DVD release of this film epic. While the new 2 disk set offers both the Arabic and English versions of film, along with a new commentary by director, Moustapha Akkad, it does not include the still galleries or trailers found on the original disk. Also the framining on the new disk is incorrect. The original features a correct 2:35 image, while the new is 1:77:1, thereby removing some picture information on the left and right of the frame. The image is also soft and grainey in many spots, almost like a poor VHS transfer. The new set does carry over the 38 minutes making of featurette included with the original DVD release. I would have expected this 25th anniversary DVD to be an improvement over the original, but it is not. A disappointment."
4,Amazing story. acceptable transfer to DVD,"1- The quality of the transfer is good, not excellent2- The story of the movie is impressive. In a time when extremists (with ideologies far from the faith) are able to dominate the media's representation of Islam and particularly perverting the essential meaning of jihad; this movie shows how one person and one Muslim community struggles against tyranny facing overwhelming odds and do it in an honorable even noble way. An entertaining and important story. See it!"
4,Silver screen classic. Must see epic. Period piece,Old studio epic film covering the efforts of Omar Mukhtar in Libya to free his nation from Italian occupation. Period piece and a great film from the era. recommended to see for historical and epic visual value.
5,Lion of the desert,"Historic movie lovers , This is the one of the top part of historyyou must see about Omar Mukhtar character one of the greatest menin the Arabia , Nickname given to his was Lion of the desert .Imagen what is the story behind this name ......"
5,Mahatma Gandhi of Libya,"This is a crown in Libya's history! You may watch this movie to learn more about Libya's independence or you may watch it to know for a fact that nothing lasts but people's right!!!It teaches you that with belief in God and determination, the nation can conquer their raped land no matter how powerful the enemy was.Regardless of your view or opinion about Libya today, this movie is a MUST SEE and a LESSON for world nations and land invaders!"
2,Lion with little bite,"The movie attempts to show the struggle not only of Mukhtar but his people. I agree with the reviewer the acting is ordinary and the theatrics of the struggle of the Libyan people against the 'ogres', the Italian Army is very melodramatic. Some fight scenes are very good but the movie is too long and is biased in the way it portrays the Italian Army as murderous heartless thugs. Romantic ideals are used rather than a balanced historic perspective. I can understand why this movie was shunned in Europe and Nth America."
1,Wish I'd binned it sooner,"This film will appeal to Muslims because it is essentially a story of Muslim brotherhood defying all odds against the overwhelming Italian modern war machine.I admired the clever devised desert war tactics, of armed cavalry beating tanks and machine gun mounted vehicles. That aside, I found the film accurately summed up in the scene where the Muslim cavalry retreated in the face of the Italian onslaught, leaving their women and children to be massacared. If you find this conduct honourable, then you'll probably enjoy the film. I didn't and found the story line over the top, the acting poor in parts, and the plot feeble. Wish I hadn't wasted my time.The underlying question for me was, why did Italy pour vast resources into a country that had nothing to offer ? not even the glory of conquering it ?Same could be said of Afghanistan today. But I didn't need to see this film to work that out."
1,Second rate,"I never saw this when it first came out and for some reason it had good reviews so I thought I would give it a chance, big mistake. Even though it had some big names in it, it is a second rate production with poor acting, direction and script. The noble Muslim against the Itaiian oppressors from a very slanted point of view. I am not excusing what Italy did but this is so very slanted that it has no real perspective to it and since the production values are so bad it just is a waste of time. Anthony Quinn is a fine actor but even he needs something to work with and this is not it.Don't waste your time of money."
3,Why is Jeff Shanon so hostile toward this Film?,"My first question is why Mr.Shannon attacks movie the Messege in his review of this film. I would like to remind Shanon that the Message was a big success in Europe and in particular in England. Even Quinn himself said that the faith of the muslims in that film revived his confidence in himself. As far as "" being critically roasted"", both these films were panned only in America and for obvious reasons. They may not have had the qualtiy of a Hollywood film, but they were both made under difficult circumstances and under financial difficulties. Also I would like to remind Shannon that even in crtically harsh United States the Messsage was still nominated for best score Oscar. Finally, I would like to say that Shannon needs to check before making comments otherwise his remakrs will be roasted by critics."
1,Terrible movie,It has a stupid plot - just natzis killing bedwins and bedwins getting even and it continues into a stupid violent movie of cold blooded killing. if you love violence watch this but don't waste your time - this movie is not worth the 3 bucks used DVD. The portrait of violence is ugly and upsetting.
4,Another Cool Collection from Rhino !,"Another strong collection in Rhino's New Wave Hits series. Great stuff like Jo Boxers' ""Just Got Lucky"" and the super cool ""Fanactic"" by Felony. Add some classic cuts from Squeeze, The Fixx and Big Country and it all adds up to a very worthy collection. Overall, great fun stuff from a time when music was catchy, clever and optimistic. If you grew up in the 80's, chances are you'll dig this CD as well as the others in this great series."
1,You should do some research first...,"You need to do some research first. This drive only writes in the DVD+RW format on DVD+RW media. The DVD standard, ie. most widely compatible format is DVD-R, which this drive does not support. This drive of course also writes CDR and CDRW, but you can get the Sony Spressa CDRW Drive...to do that. I almost bought this drive due to the misleading marketing of these drives, but now I know.If you want a true DVD compatible burner (DVD-R), buy the Pioneer or the Philips."
3,Leaks,"The suction is great,lifts out all spots,especially from my old cat who throws up a lot. The bad part is that the solution holder leaks,and the entire tank leaks so it really makes a mess.I used to put a large towel under it,but it leaks too much. I still use it, but now we use a spray bottle for the water and then use the brush and suction power because it is too expensive to throw away."
1,Not so durable,"Was pleased with this spot cleaner for the first three uses. Then it stopped spraying cleaner. At first I thought it was clogged, but it turned out the motor had burned out. Repair center was unable to fix the burned out motor."
1,Not worth it,"It worked only once. I haven't used it in a while and when I needed it again, I couldn't get it to spray. Maybe our hard water gives it hard time. Sponge and strong detergent get the same job done and it's cetainly less noisy."
1,Broke twice,"The arm sprayer on this machine broke once, so I ordered a new part from the manufacturer. After only 3 uses, the new sprayer broke. I did not order another part, I'm going to try something else (haven't decided what yet). As for the cleaning, it would clean juice stains and other miscellaneous stains (I don't have pets) well, but they would reappear after a few days of cleaning."
1,CAUTION - FREQUENT BREAKDOWNS OCCUR,"Target has a ""no return or exchanges after 90 days"" policy. This is my third machine and each one has had some small problem (brush wouldn't spin, no heat or a leak). Since I did not use this frequently, I was not aware of the latest problem until the 93rd day of purchase.Thanks to Target's policy, I cannot return and to repair I would be charged. My machine will now cost twice as much!Keep this ""No return or exchange policy after 90 days"" in mind when buying early Christmas gifts!"
2,Overpriced considering the problems encountered,"After just a few uses, I encountered the same problems described below: clogged jet, unstiff brush, fair suction power, etc. Essentially I now have a $100 wet/dry vac. It looks cool though with that green plastic, I guess. By removing the brush, I can spray the solution, but will probably revert to using a bucket of hot soapy water, a stiff brush, and elbow grease and use the Little Green to then suck the water up. Remember: the key to getting your carpet spots clean is EXTRACTING; otherwise you're just moving dirty water around your carpet and leaving it there. You'll still need to bring in a truck mounted cleaning crew to really clean your entire carpet areas."
3,It's great...when it works,"I've had three Little Greens, including one refurbished one given me by Bissell when its predecessor quit. The turbo brush nozzle clogs and needs a lot of fussing to clear. The regular non-turbo tool is better and resists clogging. The pumps seem to be the really weak part and they don't last through many uses. Too bad, because I really need something like the Little Green. As the title says, it really does a fine job while it works, but it's not long lived."
2,Not enough suction,"My biggest problem was that there was not enough suction. Spraying and brushing can be done just as easily without this machine, it's the suction that makes the difference. This machine doesn't come close to being effective when it comes to extracting the stain. I tried it on 3 stains (cat puke, red juice, ash) none have come out completely. I can't recommend this product."
2,great until it breaks,"We bought this when we got a puppy and our daughter started potty training. It was great with cleaning up messes from both. HOWEVER, after not using it for a few months, I pulled it out to steam our couch, and it no longer worked-it wouldn't spray. I followed directions posted in a review to clean out the tubes, but that didn't work (and I broke off a piece of plastic taking off a tube because the tube had glued itself to the plastic). At any rate, it seems the heat box was no longer working and was overheating, and the heat light was on no matter what. When I put it back together, it still wouldn't spray, and then I could smell the machine overheating. I chucked it. Now I'm looking for a larger steam vac that will do whole carpets and upholstery."
2,No Power and clogs,"I brought this yesterday. I was very disappointed in it's performance. The vacuum (water suction part of it) gets clogged and doesnt work without being cleaned repeatedly adding significant time to the task. It is also hard to clean since it is just a slit in the attachment. It didnt get all the water up. As well, the 'turbo' brush merely spins like any other brush. I didnt see anything turbo about it.Also, this is not good for cleaning a large area as you are bent down and have to get up close and personal with the floor with the hose. I am sure it would suffice for spot cleaning but that is not what I brought it for. I plan to return it tomorrow and exchange it for a larger upright model perhaps a different brand. I brought this for the price and what it said it could do.In sum, this is great if you want to clean a really small area but dont expect to be able to get all the water up."
3,Works great when it works,"To heat or not to heat? Doesn't seem to make much of a difference when it's heated. Cleaning it out is a bit annoying, especailly after someone else cleaned a pet accident and didn't bother cleaning it out. (Peee-ew!) The spray nozzle jet gets constantly clogged and is enough to drive me bonkers! I end up taking the sprayer end off and just giving the stain a good soaking by just spraying the solution onto it instead of using the fancy sprayer then soaking it back up after I put the sprayer nozzle back on. Gets tedious if cleaning after a new puppy."
2,Caution - frequent breakdowns and leaks,"I have returned two Bissel Green Machines and the third is on it's way to my appliance graveyard. Each model has leaked and the power brush can work intermittently.When it works, it works great, but it is not very durable. Save money and buy the one without the heater. Be prepared for a possible short life span."
2,Disappointed but warned,"I did a lot of research on this cleaner before I purchased it. The reviews were pretty mixed. Either people loved it or hated it. Now that I have tried it I'm afraid that I am one of those people who was disappointed with it. A lot of negative reviews mentioned leaking. I thought perhaps the manufacturer had solved this problem by now, but my cleaner leaked VERY badly! The heater also seemed to work inconsistantly. In addition, I also felt that the suction was not adequate; It seemed like there was a lot of detergent left in my carpeting. I am not sure what I will replace this with, but I will be returning it tomarrow--- disappointed, but not terribly surprised because I was warned."
4,amazing,I am physically limited and can't easily push a vacuum. I needed a small carpet cleaning unit I could handle yet do a good job cleaning up small spills and other messes. This cleaner performed admirably. It cleaned some stubborn pet stains and smells well beyond what I had hoped. I particularly liked the heater which heated the cleaning solution and added to its cleaning power. This product did all it was designed to do. The suction is very powerful for such a small vacuum and the turbo brush is wonderful! It's so easy to use ; you'll love it!
1,One Time Use Only,"I purchased this cleaner within the past 6 months and have only be able to use it once. The first out-of-box use was wonderful. I cleaned and stored the unit. I pulled the cleaner out last week to clean a spill and I could not get the turbo brush to spray. It did vacuum and the brush rotated, but I could not use it to spray the cleaning fluid/water. My husband spent a good deal of time trying to identify and clean the clog, but to no avail. I tried the basic brush. Worked great for the first spray then clogged. Now neither brush sprays. This was a BAD purchase."
2,Don't throw it out!,"As others have stated - it works well when it works. I was really happy with the way it cleaned. I especially liked the turbo brush. But when I went to use it for only the second time the sprayer wouldn't work - a frequent complaint I understand. You don't have to be particularly handy to fix it. You need a screw driver, a pair of pliers and a paper clip. Unplug the machine. Take the four screws from the top out. Pull the top up. Underneath you will see a black box with 4 screws - undo. Underneath the cover is heater box. Lift up and undo the 5 screws on the bottom. You will see what is causing the problem. You don't need to disconnect the wires. Release the clamps holding the plastic tubes with the pliers and gently remove the tubes. Use the paper clip, opened, to clean out the holes in the heater. It did not take long at all."
2,A sloppy mess machine,"I bought this one after my 2nd Hoover SteamVac Jr. had a broken part. Granted, we have cats and an old dog in the house, so there is a lot of cleaning for the little Vac. Still, I was tired of having to replace the steam vac. So I decided to try the Little Green machine.Compared with the Hoover Jr (which is by no means a super machine), this machine does a POOR job vaccumming up the liquid it sprays out. It leaves carpet and other surfaces practically wet. But that is not what bothers me most.This machine is designed in such a way that one is bound to spill the nasty yuck one vaccums up. Part of the reason is that the bottom of the dirty reservoir leaks. Then the dirty liquid reservoir is designed with an opening on top (why???) and if one is not extra careful, that nasty stuff inside will spill out with the slightest tilt. It is exasperating how easy it is to spill the dirty liquid.This machine is not worth the trouble. I am going to get another Hoover SteamVac Jr."
4,amazed - so far...,used this little guy for the first time last night and removed 6 stains (4 of which were at least 6 months old) - I was really amazed at the power for being so small - I know that there have been complaints of them clogging but I haven't had it long enough to argue that point...so far so good.
2,Disappointing,Within the first year we had to take this machine to a vacuum repair shop to unclog all of the hoses to get it to work again. The repair tech. was very helpful and told us we have to run hot clean water through the machine after every use to prevent clogging - VERY inconvenient!
3,Not Using the Heat Yet,"We'd used Little Green before, and in buying one of our own, we decided to fork over the extra $15 for the Proheat model. So far, though, we haven't used the heat feature. The instructions state to spray the cleaner for a good 10-15 seconds to clear out the old cleaner from the tubes and cycle through the heated cleaning fluid. If I really did that, I'd be wasting a lot of money on that fluid. I'm okay with the fluid not being heated, and if we happen to use it enough in one try that it does come out warm, all the better."
2,turbo brush a waste,Machine leaks when used.The turbo brush hardly spins.Save your money and buy a good hoover carpet cleaner with spin scrub-it comes with a brush for stairs and upholstery cleaning.
5,Little green / heat,"Love this, took out every stain in my house, old and new. I use it on my carpet, couches, office chairs and cars. When there's a spill everyone gathers around to see it in action. Works on dog mess, spilled drinks and food. Going strong for 8 months now."
4,leaky but good cleaner,"I love the way it cleans the upholstery. I have hard wood floors. While dragging it around the floor cleaning my couch, it scratched my floors and leaked somehow everywhere I'd been. I though maybe it was me when I put the tank on. Took it to carpet, without filling the tank, cleaned a rug and the place I had it sitting, soaking wet. I'll keep a towel under it from now on! I do like the heat. People say it's just a few degrees, well, how hot do they want it?? works well for cleaning."
