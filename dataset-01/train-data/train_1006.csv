3,the movie was better,I watched the movie prior to reading the book. The movie had better one-liners and the story was more interesting.
4,First time,"I'm a first time Neil Gaiman reader, and though I love his subjects, his writing style takes a little getting used to. I do love this book and highly recommend it, the four stars are only because of the "" how did they get there, who is that, oh well I accept it"" style of writing, which in hindsight is kind of cool, some books spend several chapters on back stories, and Neil just wants to get to the point. Maybe that comes from starting with comics and then short stories. Still a great story none the less."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DIGITAL EDITION.,"Awaiting feedback on really terrible formatting errors in the Kindle edition (as in, it's currently unreadable). Will update if anything changes."
5,Excellent,"This is a wonderful book. It doesn't just tell the story of a trip from the mundane world into faerie, it tells the story of a boy becoming a man, and how he gains knowledge of himself and his world while doing so.Some reviewers have complained that the story could have been longer. In the hands of a less-gifted author it could have been a fantasy trilogy still going after ten books. That Gaiman left so much to the reader's imagination is a good thing in my opinion. Leaving so much out underlines just how vast and mysterious faerie is.Highly recommended."
5,Splendid!,"Stardust was my introduction to Neil Gaiman. Simply put, it is a beautiful and sad little book. If you ever want a quick read that will give the satisfaction of time well spent, here it is; you will not be disappointed."
4,Very good,"This is not as good as Neverwhere or the best of the Sandman comics, but it is still very good. Gaiman writes in a style that doesn't seem to be much, but in reality it is extremely mannered. This is a good book if you like the old time, Lord Dunsany-style, pre-Tolkien fantasy."
3,A Delightful read,"Truly this fantasy took me by surprise. Stardust is at times funny, scary, and at the end, quite touching. I enjoyed it very much and do recommend it. Gaiman is a writer to watch. I have read Neverwhere and while that is a fine work, I liked Stardust much better. I certainly do intend to read more of his work."
3,Not my cup of tea,"Young Tristran Thorn promises to retrieve a fallen star from the realm of Faerie to impress his true love. He will learn that the star is more than he thought, and he is not the only one who seeks it.I am not the ideal reader for this book and I did not read it under the most ideal conditions. I am not a particular fan of fairy tales. Neil Gaiman writes very well, often beautifully, but the story feels like he fished for story elements in a grab bag of fairy tale tropes and strung them together in a narrative that feels very arbitrary and filled with coincidence. In a world where virtually anything can happen, it can become hard to care about what happens. To compound matters, I read the story in its E-book version. Only later did I become aware that it had been published previously with reportedly gorgeous illustrations by Charles Vess. I suspect that, had I read that version, I might have been more positive toward the story."
5,Magic for grown ups,"There is something magical about this book, something that makes you feel as if you have been transported back to your childhood, yet you still know everything you know now. You are the wise and witty, woe ridden and world weary person you wanted to be as a child. You're having fun reading a fairy tale but you aren't a kid. It's great.It's hard to explain how this book makes you feel.Gaiman somehow manages to take every fairytale character you've ever met and turn them into someone you recognise. Yes, they're magical - good or evil, but still ... you've met that person, or someone very like them. And every character evokes an emotion - a difficult thing to achieve, yet Gaiman does it.I am not an unreserved fan of Neil Gaiman, some of his recent work is losing its sparkle for me. But this never will. In Stardust, he hit the nail on the head. If you are just starting with Neil - try this one first.Oh, and it's a LOT better than the movie."
3,"great story, not for children!","I loved The Graveyard Book so I was a little surprised at this one. Not that it's not good writing, it is! But the sex scenes were graphic and took me by surprise. It's listed as a 'teen' novel but when I donated my copy to the library (I buy and then donate- no more shelf space!) they put it in the adult section. My nine year old kept trying to pick it up and read it and I'm glad I read it first! Without the sex, it woud have been a perfectly good novel for kids, but Gaiman rasied the bar with those two paragraphs. :O"
3,A bit disappointed,"I must echo another reviewer in saying that I was first drawn to this story from the movie, but sadly I fear (and I have never said this about a book before) the movie was better. The character development I felt was minimal and the story seemed to have a lack of spark between it's main characters. Personally I enjoyed the movie more."
3,"Pleasing prose, not enough meat on the bones","I found out about this book (as many people likely will) because I saw the movie preview and was intrigued. As a lover of fantasy stories, I decided to check it out. I enjoyed the descriptions and the quirky turns of phrase, but I would have liked a little more story. The characters were interesting enough to lend enough material for a book twice as long. I felt that some story lines emerged and disappeared equally quickly. Gaiman glosses over weeks or even months of traveling and adventures, material that would likely have made the most interesting parts of the story. As I said, Gaiman's voice and diction are great, but the story left a bit to be desired."
3,Dissapointing,"Several people recommended this author, and after seeing the previews for the movie I finally decided to read this book, and I had high expectations for it. Overall it was an interesting and original fairy tale, but I have to agree with some of the other reviews, except for a couple of sex scenes this read like a young adult book. He introduces many interesting characters but then doesn't tell you much about them. I felt like I was holding the magic candle that he describes in the book, it helped the holder cover vast distances with a few steps, I wanted to stop and get to know these characters and their backgrounds but instead I just got glimpses of them, until finally I reached the too easy to predict ending."
3,Oops,"I just recieved my mass-market paperback edition in the mail and discovered that, while it has color plates, they are images from the movie, not the Charles Vess illustrations I was expecting. I'm looking forward to reading the book, but I do wish I'd paid the few extra bucks to get the artwork."
2,A decent trot,"Again, I must apologize for my Gaiman-antipathy. I know in part it's personal, and I encourage you to look beyond that. The simple fact of the matter is that Neil Gaiman and I are *never* on the same page, no matter what book I have open._Stardust_ is okay. It's a quick yarn, got some cute references to fairy tales, and the occasional decent pun. But there's nothing remarkable upon it. No actually interesting characters or situations or turns of phrase. It's forgettable."
5,The ONLY edition of Stardust to buy.,"This oversized illustrated edition is the ONLY edition of Stardust that does the story justice. The pictures are amazing, and even the typography occasionally changes to serve the story. I received this book as a gift several years ago, and I treasure it. I was amazed and disappointed to discover the book was ever released without these illustrations, and that some people actually would only know it that way."
3,Interesting Ideas - But Expectations Not Met,"I purchased this book after reading the summary listed on Amazon and thought it would be quite interesting. However, the author did not seem to want to go into much detail. He had crafted some amazing ideas, but overlooked some of the opportunities to develop them. There was alot of potential that he missed out on. Other than that, I found the book to be rather enjoyable. I would recommend the book to readers who don't have to much time to get drawn into other more developed books."
3,decent,"Not what I would consider an amazing book. I would suggest you borrow it, but now buy it. Not something I'll read through a second time."
2,Very disapointed,"I bought this book after seeing the movie which I absolutely loved. This was the first book I have read by Gaiman and I am so unimpressed I don't think I'll be reading any of his other work.This book felt like he wrote one draft, passed it on to his editor, and had it published. The characters were half formed, the plot meandering, and the conflicts were weak. Characters were given easy outs for every conflict presented to them. In the final conflict with the antagonist(gaiman spends most of the story working up to this) he uses a deus ex machina ending(an improbable turn of events used to resolve the conflict.) The world building was half done as well.The ideas, although original, lacked any real substance. It is very rare that I would ever say this, but if you love a good fairy tale or love story, watch the movie. Gaiman's ideas were expanded on to create a truly magical story."
3,a fine journey through Faerie,"As a fan of fantasy, I must admit that Neil Gaiman surely is a great writer. Stardust takes you from the borders of our reality into the very depths of the land of Faerie with startling ease... His style is beautiful yet sometimes cruel, and the story amazingly haunting."
3,ripped,"I got it in a very short time, however, it had some ripped pages at the end including the back cover of the book. it also kinda seemed like it had been in water and then dried out. that hard wavy paper kind of texture.Good book tho, and I can read it just fine without real troubles."
3,Not too bad,"Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't seen the movie first... I couldn't help making comparisons as I was reading it. It was a good story, lots of imagination and originality. Also, the writing style was clear and entertaining to read. But, the love story was kind of lacking, with point A to B with no stops in between. The ending was also anticlimactic. It wasn't a bad book at all, but not my favorite fantasy novel either. I give it 3.5 stars."
4,"Nice twists, but not for kids","This book was a nice fast read, and had some fairly interestesting and unexpected twists to keep you entertained. There were also some really racy parts, though, making it not for kids, though I would think they would love the basic story. I haven't seen the movie yet, and anticipate that it will be interesting to compare."
5,"Good Movie, Better Book","I love Gaiman's style of writing, witty though quite serious at times. He remains descriptive without boring you with unneccesary details. His imagination is fantastic- this is a fantasy story unlike any other I've read!"
4,A Quaint Fairy Tale,Stardust is an enjoyable light read that has all the fantastical elements of some of Gaiman's Sandman work. It works for those that want to be whisked away to an imaginative time and place. It fails for those looking for something with a bit of edge. You'd never guess this was the same guy who wrote the Neverwhere.
4,"Liked the book, LOVED the movie!",This is probably the only book I've ever read where I liked the movie better!
4,Good!,Stardust sort of reminds me of a combination of The Odyssey and Alice in Wonderland. Neil Gaiman has a gift for story telling and writing stories that are well thought out and have a satisfying ending.
4,"Great, quick read","Once I got past the language, it was a great book. Quick and easy to read. Great for a cold weekend by the fire."
3,Stardust,"very good short novel about a boy, Tristan, who is promised anything he desires from the lovely Victoria, if he brings her the fallen star they saw. Charming adventure with creatures of faerie and witches! The movie doesn't take away from the book and is quite different to the written story, so the readers attention is still kept."
3,"Gaiman can, and has... done much better!","This book stands out as one of the very few examples where I liked the movie BETTER than the book. For some reason, it fell somewhat flat to me. The story is charming, but translated to film much better in my opinion.I read this immediately after finishing American Gods, and believe me... it was something of a letdown!"
3,One case where the movie was actually better than the book.,"I really enjoyed the movie so I thought I'd love the book, but it wasn't that great. I'm actually surprised they bothered to make this book into a movie at all but I'm glad they did. It's an interesting concept but the story kind of fell flat. You didn't really get the sense that the characters were falling in love, they just suddenly decided that they were. They didn't really resolve their problems either. The problems just seemed to magically disappear at the end. It was almost as though the author got tired of the story and just decided to end it with everyone living happily ever after. It wasn't the best book, but it was a quick read. It was worth the short investment of time that I gave to it."
3,Pas Mal,"Welll... To be completely honest I do NOT understand all the hype this book has gotten. Is it because of the movie?? I don't know. I'm just very confused. I read the whole thing through, waiting patiently for it to pull me in, but I kept waiting... and waiting... and then I finished the book. :-\ I really was hoping to find another fantastic fantasy to put on my ""keeper"" shelf, but this book just fell short for me.Now, that's not to say this is a poorly written book. The prose was actually quite good. I enjoyed the writer's tone and his easy and fast-paced storytelling. He really has a knack for keeping a story going and great flow.What I found lacking was the depth of the characters. I never really cared for any of the main characters at all. If either of the main characters had died, I probably wouldn't have blinked an eye. That, I think, is the main problem with the book. I never felt any connection with the characters, and for me, that is essential for my reading enjoyment."
4,Better than the movie,"Gaiman is a bit less dark in this novel than in ""American Gods"" and ""Neverwhere"". Consequently, I did not enjoy it as much. Perhaps dealing with a fictional land rather than a landscape somewhat familiar to me reduced my enjoyment. He tells a fine story, however, and the book is better than the movie."
2,Not Too Much Glitter in this Star,"I like Gaiman's books...usually. This one was very disappointing. A mishmash of old generic plot lines for fairytales and not too well put together. And, if written for children (as for the most part it seems to be), please tell me why there are such explicit sex scenes in this book!This is a Gaiman book to skip."
2,Horrible Book,"When I finished reading this book, I felt that I had wasted a few hours of my life. The characters are not developed at all. The story barely exists. There are so many positive reviews of this book that this will probably not affect anyone's decision, but I like virtually any good fantasy story. This book just does not have a story or interesting characters."
2,"If What You Want Is To Go Hollywood, Then Don't Write Books","I've now read three Neil Gaiman books, brought on by the fanaticism of some friends of mine who are fans of his.It's clear that what this fellow really wants to do is to be a movie producer, and each one of these books that I've read sounds like it has been the product of a Hollywood pitch meeting, like something out of The Producer.If I ever see Neil Gaiman's screen credit on ""The Graduate: Part Two"", I'll be sure to look for it when it comes on HBO. In the meantime, I'd rather read books that were written to be books, and comics that were written to be comics, and not second-rate attempts to make another medium do things it can't do very well."
3,Not for males.,"I love Neil Gaiman, I own almost everything he has been a part of. However, this book is for girls, and since I am not a girl I will not review it beyond saying that it did not make me hate females (I'm looking at you Twilight.)"
2,dull,"I truly expected more from this but from beginning to end it seemed trite, unconvincing and entirely too derivative. The characters fall flat and the writing is simplistic. At least it IS short."
2,Blah,"This is my first book by this author, and I honestly feel like I might like the story after-the-fact, if the author didn't ruin all the punchlines in the book. The fact that he felt the need to explain away every twist in the plot made me feel like I was being beat over the head with a ""Did you get it?"" stick. I also thought he was over-doing the fairytale theme, with the swirly chapter pages and obligatory detail that had zero quirks."
4,A wonderful adventure,"I just finshed reading Stardust, and for my money, there is no better Fairie Tale then the one Gaiman spins between the covers of Stardust. It is as easy to get lost in the pages of this book as it is to become lost in your own day dreams. Gaiman's characters are light, the adventures they share are magical, and in the end, everything works out as it should... Anyone who wants to excape from the world of the mundane into the world of Fairie would do well to follow Tristran through the gap in the wall...and besides, sometimes we all need to chase falling stars."
4,Fans of this Should Check Out Hope Mirrlees,"Excellent fantasy novel but Neil Gaiman's vision of faerie was inspired (as he himself admits) by Hope Mirrlees classic 1926 novel Lud-In-The-Mist which i recommend very strongly to Gaiman fans. I have just finished reading it and its superb. Currently in print in the UK (amazon.co.uk) and described by Gaiman as the ""The single most beautiful,solid,unearthly and unjustifiably forgotten novel of the twentieth century"""
4,"Nicely written, but I want more of it!","Stardust is exceptionally crafted. True to Gaiman form, there's not a wasted word on the page. The whole thing just drips with beguiling imagery.It's a good story. A tad predictable, but it's a fairy tale, so you can't really expect much else. Granted, I had hoped Gaiman would've put some weird twist on the whole thing, the way he so often does in his short fiction (""Snow, Glass, Apples"" is a prime example of this) but I can live with this. Nonetheless I'd have like to see more of the journey than some ""throwaway"" bits towards the end. One line was all we got about goblin press-gangs and a narrow escape. One line was all we got about fighting the mighty eagle. We barely got a chapter about the cloud ships. All these fascinating ideas, seemingly throw in to enrich the story a bit without actually fleshing it out. Sure, that would've made it an ""epic"" instead of a ""fairy tale"" but if anyone could pull it off, it'd be Gaiman.Still, a good read."
3,"Okay, but that's it.","I was eager to read this book after watching the movie. I typically like to do it the other way around, as most of the time, the book is way better than the movie. This book, however, is not as good as the movie, and I was sorely disappointed. I thought the book was cute, but I was looking for more depth in the characters and more story from the movie, but found that the movie had more. The changes made for the movie were wise, and would have been better in the book as well."
3,Did I miss something?,"Yes, this was a cute story. Cute enough to rate 3 stars. But it was pure fluff. A cute fairy tale story that flows along smoothly to an ending where everything gets tied up into a perfect little, utterly predictable package. I finished it in one day, and not because I was so entranced I couldn't put it down. Don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike it, it's a great story to take your mind off things. But from reading the reviews here, I was expecting a fantasy masterpiece. Just to warn potential readers, if you're looking for substance, you're in the wrong place."
3,A sweet adult fairy tale!,"Tristran Thornton was born in Faerie but raised in Wall, England. He returns to the land of his birth by walking through a guarded opening in the wall of his city. In Faerie, he seeks to retrieve a fallen star and bring it home to his love because she said she'd consent to marry him if he did so. He finds the fallen star vastly different from what he imagined. Nevertheless, his quest is to bring the fallen star to his love back home and this is what he is determined to do.Stardust reads like a fairy tale for grownups with some of Neil Gaiman's humor thrown in to pepper it up. There are witches, fairies, and even a unicorn. It's a light love story with a bit of enchantment. It's fine, but truthfully I prefer Gaiman's other books which are more thoughtful (American Gods) or more humorous (Neverwhere)."
2,Bait,"It seems to me that Neil Gaiman is simply using writing as a stepping stone to his real interest which is movies and lunch at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills. Nauseating, especially after seeing Princess Monotony."
1,WAST OF TIME READING THIS BOOK,"THIS BOOK WAS SO BORING I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH IT, WAS A WAST OF TIME AND MONEY."
1,"All of his works are trash, not just this alone.","Neil Gaiman is certainly talented in a WRONG WAY. He just doesn't know what real fantasy is. And, if he doesn't know the right words to say about something, he'd better keep mum than use wrong words to defile true beauty of life. Tell him to come back when he is good enough.Michael Lloyd"
3,"I never thought I'd say it, but the movie is better. O.o","I didn't really feel too much attachment to the characters until much later in the book. It seemed to have taken its time in the beginning to build up an attachment to Dunstan Thorn and the slave lady, and then after that it just seemed to jump around and not really leave me yearning to read more and more. It was a cute story but also a sad story. I enjoyed it, I was just wishing to enjoy it much more. I am a little disappointed. I was not expecting to read a sex scene at all in this either (right in the beginning)."
4,Modern Fairy Tale Told By One Of Our Best,"This is the story of a man who is searching for a fallen star so he can deliver it to his 'true love'. This is an fun tale. Gaiman has such a unique voice, I guess it is one of those things that you reckognize and become attached to--like Stephen King's works.There are various adventures working their way into the plot--they are all on a collision course, creating anxiety and a buisy climax. I really enjoyed it, and if you like any other work from Mr. Gaiman or the genre then pick it up and read."
5,wonderful book,I loved this book so much. It kept my focus through out the whole book. I loved the fact that I wasn't able to figure out what was going to happen next. There are too many books like that out there today and it was refreshing to read this one.
2,Forgettable,"I read this book after watching the movie and being disappointed by it. It was strange, the movie had a great plot and a ton of potential but just kind of fell flat. As a long time member of 'the book was better' club I decided that the movie makers must have mangled it and got the book. The book was not better.This was my first Gaiman book, but since I had heard good things I entered with high expectations. I remember plots. I remember characters. I remember little bits of trivia that others forget. I wish I could give you a detailed review describing specifically where this book went wrong, but for the life of me I cannot remember. I do remember feeling like I was waiting for the story to pick up and take off right up until the book ended in its blah-like fashion. Gaiman managed to take what had the potential to be a great story and turned it into a chore."
4,"Short, sweet fairytale",A surprisingly romantic fantasy from Gaiman. A good read for those who want a heroic journey through fairyland.
5,Beautiful story for all ages,"I enjoy reading fantasy books, but I'm careful in selecting them since I don't like those that are too juvenile. My fears were completely unfounded with ""Stardust"" as this is a beautiful story that ""works"" on many levels and is suitable for all ages. I was drawn to the characters, most of who have both redeeming and unpleasant qualities that make them believable.I have the paperback version which is very portable but I now wish I had bought the hardback since this is a book I'd like to keep and pass down to others."
5,Absolutely Precious!,"I have read this book multiple times over the last couple years and for anyone who loves fantasy, or just loves to revisit that childhood mystical innocence, will enjoy this book. Don't be fooled though, Stardust is not a children's story. Gaiman throws a little sex, violence, and pure insanity into the mix, as usual! It's why his fans love his writing. It's never quite what you expect..."
5,Amazing,"Such an awesome story/book. wouldn't suggest it to young adults below 13 years of age due to some sexual content and some mild language. But all in all such an amazing story:) I'm sure my children's, children will enjoy."
3,A decent story of fantasy and love,"I saw the movie Stardust and was interested in reading the book to hope for a better story because everyone always says books are better than movies. And the book had some variations from the movie, but overall it was pretty similar. Some parts were a tad slow though and honestly I didn't think the book was really better than the movie. They were just different. I still think the book was worth reading, and definitely so if you haven't seen the movie."
4,good but not quite great,"Mr. Gaiman writes a beautiful and suspenseful fantasy, filled with interesting characters, in _Stardust_. I also really liked the depiction of real love versus infatuation. However, I felt that the story needed more depth (the characters, while interesting, could have used even more development). Also, there is one use of the f-word that is unnecessary and I think actually detracts from the book for 2 reasons. 1) I found it out of character of the majestic and aloof character that says it, and 2) it makes the book inappropriate for readers who otherwise would appreciate it. Overall, though, I really enjoyed _Stardust_."
4,Adult Fairy Tale,"The fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm have an undertone of lust, violence, ambition, altruism, or greed or some combination of all of the above. Neil Gaiman picks up those story elements and spins them into a delightful 21st century variation on the classic themes. Suspend disbelief the moment you start this book, and you will be transported into that magical fairy tale land where you may find that part of you still lives.Stardust"
4,A sweet fairy tale,"Pretty good book. I like the depth that it goes into on some areas, but the ending is quite odd. There is a definite difference between the movie and the book, but both are worth your time. The pictures are beautiful and it is just a pleasure to have such an enchanting small world to escape into. I recommend this book to anyone who has a heart for a world that doesn't rely on reason."
4,Gaiman's Nod to Dunsany,"STARDUST might be classified as Gaiman's nod to Lord Dunsany's THE KING OF ELFLAND'S DAUGHTER, as it certainly follows in that tradition, and does make reference to it as well.I think Gaiman has done better, however, especially in his SANDMAN series. Nonetheless, STARDUST is a good read and certainly worth your time."
4,He can't play guitar Stef?,"Having saw Frank play live many times, especially in the 70's around Halloween time in Boston at the Music Hall, this dvd paints a good picture of his shows at that time. Having also seen Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Robin Trower, Dickey Betts, Gary Rossington, Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana among many others, to hear someone say that Frank Zappa could not play guitar very well is actually pretty funny. Anyone that would say that (forget all the crazy non guitar stuff)about FZ must also think that about the names I listed above. I'm not sure why anyone would bother writing something like that about FZ, must have nothing better to do when they are not critiquing for Rolling Stone"
2,Incredibly tedious experience...,"This film was a disappointment for me, I had never seen it before until this DVD, and being a HUGE hardcore Frank Zappa fan even I found it to be incredibly tedious to sit through. It was just too long and it could have been edited down. I found a lot of it boring and unfunny. It has great moments but as a whole it falls flat on it's face as a film. I found the claymation to be pretty unique and most of the concert footage was pretty good too, the performance of 'Punky's Whips' is particularly great. I preferred the 'Does Humor Belong In Music?' DVD a lot more. I doubt I could ever sit through Baby Snakes in it's entirety again, thank God the convenience of DVD Chapters."
1,Doesn't play on Sony Playstation.....,"Despite the ""PS2 Compatible"" printing on the DVD jacket, this DVD does not play on the PS2."
5,"aren't we being a little picky, gang?","I have come across a few reviews for this release which complain about the quality of the print and lack of bonus material. Let's put things in perspective. This concert was shot 25 years ago, in 1977,the same year ""Star Wars"" Came out. There was no VHS tape yet and no video rental market! Any bonus material was left on the cutting room floor!! When George Lucas planned to re-release ""Star Wars"" He found the original negatives had deteriorated to the point where they were almost unusable to make new theatrical prints of the movie. It is entirely possible that the print of ""Baby Snakes"" used for the DVD is the best source material and to digitally restore the images would have been too expensive. Let's be thankful that great care was given to enhancing the music,which is what this film is about."
5,Goodness snakes! What a trip!,"Not just a glimpse of genius, but a virtal smorgasbord! In this video, many twisted minds come together like baby snakes in the night, producing a sensory overload unequalled by any group of artists. You have the totally bizarre claymation freak-outage, the uninhibited backstage showing off, and the not-frequent-enough footage of Zappa squeezing every drop of musical talent from his band members in rehearsal. Then you have the irreplaceable concert footage- it's such a blast to watch Terry Bozzio clad in a devil's mask and underwear, banging away at the drums like a maniac. Zappa commands the stage but then drags in an assortment of audience members, a blow up doll, a talking toy cop car and even his road crew manager for comic measure, as if he needs to get more random. Oh yeah, there's some amazing guitar playing, too.If this sounds like fun to you, you are not normal and you will enjoy watching this. I totally recommend it!"
3,musically rewarding & illuminating....,"...but some of the footage has not aged well since those wacky crazy days, as mentioned in other reviews, the blow up doll stuff is puerile beyond 'artistic' merit and backstage hamming up also gets grating. Not being a fan of Zappa I was impressed by his stage presence and repartee with his excellant band and the audiovisual is good quality. The stop frame clay animation is trippy and fantastic for a while...all in all I'd personally have edited this down to a killer 90 minute concert rather than have left it as a sprawling epic."
3,Zappa d'allure!,"Pour les vrai fanatiques de Zappa; une chose est sr, nous sommes en 2003 (bientt 2004) et ces enregistrements date des année 70, je trouve que c'est pas mal pour un vidéo de ces années! Si on parle de l'aspect visuel et audio, et du cté musical : excellent! Si vous tes un fan de Zappa vous aller aimer son humour assez spécial car il y a des aspect sur ce DVD qu`on ne peut retrouver qu'avec un film de Zappa. Un must pour les mélomanes et connaisseurs!"
2,Great content bad 5.1 mix,First of all I must say there are few people as devoted as I am to the collected works of Frank. This is a must have DVD HOWEVER the stereo mix is better than the 5.1 mix. I have a high end 7.1 sound system and play through Bowers and Wilkins and a great amp and pre-amp. The mix is muddled and unbalanced when I play through 5.1.If you buy it check it out and see the stero mix is better .
4,Your Essential Frank Zappa DVD Purchase,"Excellent concert footage of FZ over Halloween 1978 with Adrian Belew on guitar, a very pouty Terry Bozzio (in what look like speedos) on drums, a fluid Patrick O'Hearn on bass unt a percussionist and 2 keyboardists. It's all performed in front of a rabid New York Palladium audience.What loses the 1 star is the Bruce Bickford claymation and too much time spent backstage listening to Roy Estrada (one of Zappa's former bass players) rambling on about nothing.The DVD is long enough (over 3 hours) and chocfull enough of live footage to overlook these annoyances, however."
1,Horrible smell,"I'm not happy with this purchase at all. While it's comfortable, it's not as firm as I was hoping for but I can live with it. What I can't live with is the smell. It has a horrible mildewy smell and after two weeks its still has not disappeared. The company suggested spraying with lemon water or Febreze. Tried it and it still smells. I might have to return this one."
1,Terrible futon pad!,"I bought this pad for my futon and it is really thin and uncomfortable. It had a chemical smell when it arrived. The picture in the advertisement is misleading, the pad is just stuffed with cotton. It doesn't come with a cover. I have seen much cheaper pads that were a better quality. I am very disappointed."
3,DOG BED,i built a wooden frame and threw this mattress on top of it as a bed for my dogs so they wouldnt sleep in my bed...after about a week or 2 the mattress is starting to show wear. it doesnt seem as thick anymore..1dog is 75lb. the other is 50lbs...oh well i ordered the wrong size by mistake so i think ill get a bigger one from somewhere else...
4,Good futon,The mattress was shipped quickly and arrived in good shape. I can't comment on how comfortable it is as it was purchased as a dog bed. They seem very happy with it. What more can I say?
2,Very uncomfortable and thin,"The item came packaged very nicely and was recieved when I was expecting it, however, it is extremely uncomfortable and thin. I bought it for the bottom of the bunk bed I just bought for my kids and my son, who is only just shy of 2, will not even sit on the bed. I was planning on sleeping in it with him so he got used to it, bt i honestly dont think that i can, it will kill my back!!!"
2,American Ugly,Seriously - the storybook narration nearly drove me mad + the children's nap-time romance that clearly was going nowhere + the raging cop vs. the twitchy perv + the snarky playground moms meets the menopausal bookgroup. Not a worthy movie (although Patrick Wilson was great to watch). Everyone amazingly grapples with redemption in the final ten minutes of the film - through a midnight playground scare + running with scissors and on top of that a dollop of skateboarding on testosterone. It felt like it was trying WAY too hard to be AMERICAN BEAUTY.
3,Not buying it,"As the clock passed the 2 hour mark, I lost hope that the time would be well spent. Way to much time with these losers- the characters. The actors are fine. But a slap on the back of the head for the characters. The only empathy available was for the poor woman who dated our perv."
1,Marital Infidelity in Suburbia,Can't anyone make a movie about people who actually love each other and remain faithful to one another? This movie is so predictable - cheating spouses looking for romance when in reality they are just self-absorbed spoiled brats.
1,Pedophilia Is Great! Marriage Stinks!,"Critics of the world, please stop buying into this Hollywood garbage. From now on when I see ""Oscar Nominated"", I will think twice about wasting my time. This movie glorifies infidelity and pedophilia while chastizing the ""boring"" institution of marriage and the unthinkably dull two-parent home. I'll take the evil suburban housewives any day. At least they value the lives of their children more than the civil rights of a sex offender. I agree with the reviewer who said the self-righteousness of the characters was laughable. It truly was. I am so sick of these ""deep"",""profound"" movies. I guess loving your spouse and child isn't ""progressive"" enough for Hollywood. Better to sleep with the neighbor and let a child molester sleep in your basement. What is wrong with people?"
1,Trash,"A complete waste of time. By far one of the worst movies I've seen in a while, along side with movies such as Babel and A Prairie Home Companion."
2,Grow Up!,"Chick flick. Sissy Boy needs to get some balls and grow up. Jennifer Connelly, cool it with the overly-dark eyebrows, you look a little too manly. Kate looks better naked than you might think at first glance."
2,Tries too hard to be clever.,"Little Children starring Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson thinks it's the clever cousin of American Beauty. I was expecting a thought-provoking and intelligent look at married couples in crisis - what I got was a bunch of self-important adults acting like greedy babies (now I know why the film is called Little Children). Whoever the narrator was of this film really got on my nerves after the first 15 minutes. Wilson has still not impressed as a serious actor while Jennifer Connelly (a true talent) barely has any scenes. Winslet is good as usual but I found it very difficult to try and feel sympathetic for her character or situation. The graphic sex scenes didn't help much, this film was a major disappointment, I'd skip this one!"
3,Good cast; stupid characters,"This is yet another one of those movies that pretends to be more important than it actually is, with more of those characters who act like a bunch of frigging morons. It gave me some bad flashbacks to House of Sand and Fog. Dumb adults + spoiled kids + a child molester in the neighborhood + unnecessary narration = something you can watch once but not really recommend or bother watching again. I will give Jackie Earle Haley credit for his performance, but that's still not enough."
1,Fatally Flawed,"I rather enjoyed this movie both times I have seen it, but there is one gaping flaw in the story which totally spoils it for me. Supposedly these two characters carry on an affair, while their pre-school children play together -- yet neither cuckolded spouse finds out from the children? Obviously the scriptwriter (and original novelist?) never had children."
3,Akward,I found this movie to be really slow and strange. From beginning to end it was just dragging by. Their is a narrator that speaks throughout the entire movie that is also very annoying.
5,Little Children,"Superbly acted by Kate Winslett and Patrick Wilson. Comedic, drama, for adults only. First American movie I like, so far, since I am a fan of British movies (which are not commercialized, wherein actors just love to act and give it all, and are not for big bucks). As usual, Kate Winslett - comedy, drama, suspense, family, musical, she can do it, superbly."
3,Well-Acted but Painful to Watch,"I thought the acting was pretty impressive, especially the actor who played the pedophile. But the constant narration/voice over in this movie ruined it for me. In my opinion, if you can't translate a book into a screenplay without constant narration to fill in the blanks, then maybe you shouldn't make the movie. When the deep voice of the narrator first came on, I seriously thought it was supposed to be a joke. But 20 minutes later I realized this was going to go on throughout the whole movie. I managed to block it out after a while and focus on the plot. All in all, a well-acted and filmed movie, but still not enjoyable to watch. And the semi-redemptive ending did not ring true to me. It seemed forced and out of touch with the tenor of the rest of the movie."
1,A Walk on the Ugly Side,"While this movie is well-acted and produced it suffers from a basic flaw: its storyline is unremittingly ugly and depressing. Its portrayal of each character's dark side continues inexorably and without relief. Little Children may be considered a modern-day tragedy, but there is no catharsis. When this dismal and overly long march concludes, my reaction was not ""The End"" but rather ""Thank God it's over."" In my opinion, stories like this just leave a bad memory about disturbed people doing disturbing things best left in a church confessional or a psycho-therapist's office. Putting the underbelly of suburbia's privileged few up close and personal is not, in and of itself, a good reason to make a movie. On the upside, this movie is perfectly made and convincingly acted. Unfortunately it is not a story worth telling."
1,Sarah: worst mother of all time!,"Beyond the fact that I couldn't stand this long, disjointed, predictable, self-important ""film"", I was utterly appalled at Sarah's (Kate Winslet) ""mothering"" skills! Here's some stuff she did that stands out:- First of all, she kissed the ""prom king"" right in front of the kid. Bad move. Especially when you're married to the kid's father!- She had an affair in the basement while the kid was sleeping upstairs. Not cool.- She left the kid with a sitter overnight just to sneak around with the ""prom king.""and here's my favorite one...- She LEFT HER KID IN A PARK SWING LATE AT NIGHT BY HERSELF WITH A PEDOPHILE ON THE LOOSE!And we're supposed to feel sympathy for this character?"
2,train wreck,"I couldn't stop watching, waiting to see where everything tied in, only to be let down. Weird movie."
3,The End?,"A well-written, well-acted and intelligent, and often sad, ensemble film, along the lines of ""Crash."" However, the ending was a bit unsatisfying and unrealistic. Kate Winslet is a terrific actress, and great performances by her surrounding cast. The ending lowered the overall rating but over-all an entertaining, thought-provoking movie."
2,Could not get into it,"I was really excited to see this, I heard so much good things about it. And I adore Kate Winslet and think her the highest and best of actresses. However, the film itself was utterly unwatchable. I kept waiting for something, anything to happen. Some hint of greatness. But nothing ever came. I don't have a problem watching slow moving films or character driven films, but I could barely get through this. It was excrutiating, and I am not exaggerating. It felt like a waste of time after I was done. I am only glad I did not actually pay any money to watch this in the theaters."
1,Thinkpad owners watch out,"Bought the card thinking it would be great to upgrade my connection to my external hardrive and my ipod and digital camera. The idea is great but the execution does not work. Firewire was working but USB 2 was not. Called up and was told that they know of the problem but that it has not been fixed in production yet! How can you sell something if its not ready???? They said I could send it back and they will make some adjustment, I HAVE TO PAY SHIPPING and they ship back GROUND!!!! Technical support guy was not even sure about the warranty status after the modification. Be careful!!!!!!!!"
3,Burning Less than Bright,"I have no doubt that this was a rather exceptional novel when it came out. In its role as a predecessor of cyberpunk, it's certainly noteworthy. But I feel it's more dated than even most of Asimov. The protagonist is supposed to be rather ""evil"" but he's really not. This is in part due to having to preclude his worse actions from the narrative (the 50's weren't so keen on rape and murder) but mostly due to the fact that Foyle's just not as bad as he wants to be. The POV shifts were handled clumsily and though Foyle doesn't have that interesting a character arc, most of the other characters are even more paper-thin.This is worth reading for it's influence and it's not a bad book. It just doesn't hold up as a classic nor does it compare to the scope and ability of more modern works."
4,Death's my destination..,Gully Foyle is my nameAnd Terra is my nationDeep space is my dwelling placeAnd death's my destination.Gully Foyle has to be one of my all-time favorite sci-fi characters. His single mindedness to accomplish his task is truly amazing and I find his dialog and the way he conducts himself around his environment very entertaining. It's almost as if he's a caveman at times and then moments later bypasses the best laid plans to stop him from accomplishing his one and only goal... Destroy all things associated with Vorga. I feel the end of this book was spectacular even if some of it was predictable.I highly recommend this book to any Sci-fi fan. It was recommended to me 13 years ago when I was working at a Used Bookstore. I pointed many to it after that and never got any disappointed responses in return.
5,"A ""jaunte"" for our time in the future",A fascinating book charged with a very imaginative tale. It has impredictable paths and solutions that are valuable for a Sci Fi book. The end is too much too crazy. For sure a recommended reading.
5,Epic sci-fi of the first magnitude,"The most astounding thing about this book is how fresh and vibrant it feels, even after more than forty years. Whereas so much of the sci-fi written in the 1950s feels dated, breathless and trite, this book could have been written today. Actually--on second thought--the book probably couldn't have been written today: it's just too good. From the initial scene of anti-hero Gully Foyle stranded in the remains of a wrecked spaceship drifting near Jupiter to the final, mind-blowing climax, Bester proves himself to be one of sci-fi's unsung masters. The plot moves like the wind: just as you feel that you have grounded your understanding of the book and are settling in, Bester drops you through yet another conceptual trap-door and leaves you breathless. As the great Samuel Delaney himself noted, this is possibly the finest sci-fi book ever written. Buy it today."
4,Read the book 40 years ago and still recall it vividly!,"Now as I think about the book up comes the ""poem"" after all this time has passed:Gully Foyle is my name, Terra is my nation, Deep space is my dwelling place, The stars my destination!I read the book while a sophmore in high school. I liked it so much and didn't quite understand it that I read it a second time--quite a rare event.Later on in college while reading James Joyce's A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN, to my distress, I discovered that Bester had pinched his poem from Joyce. Thus perhaps this brief review will stimulate someone to read both excellent works and see what I am talking about. Cheers!"
1,Great Book: HORRID kindle editing!,"This is, of course, one of the absolute classics in science fiction ... too bad that this kindle edition makes the book almost unreadable. None of the special characters, poor paragraph formatting and numerous typos and missing quote marks throughout the text will ruin the book for anyone who is trying to capture the great sci-fi retelling of the count of monte cristo."
4,Great SF that deserves a wider audience,"""The Stars My Destination"" presents a convincing future in the prologue, introduces the hateful wretch Gulliver Foyle and then roars along on a high-energy narrative. Vivid set pieces, sharp social commentary, and a future world that hasn't dated. Many old SF novels are tedious because their vision of the future is so wonky and period-bound. Nothing dates faster than yesterday's vision of the future. Bester's is almost contemporary, with big business controlling the universe, insightfully-drawn characters and ideas that have influenced modern SF. Highly recommended, especially for those interested in tracing SF's development."
2,"Like plot, like protagonist.","I'm not one to chastise a story for being outdated. And I have to admit, this particular book does reflect its years with dignity in a conceptual context. Unfortunately, the plot never really ascends to its full potential. Like its hero in the beginning, the book is a well of possibilities with no purpose to drive it to greatness. Also, inconsistencies and non-researched science (the light side of the moon always faces the sun...there is no 14-day swap in light and darkness) hamper the story to anyone who can recall the last few pages or who's spent ten seconds in a high-school physics class. Morally, the book runs a tad preachy (don't abandon faith for it shall set you free) and ideologically it never really takes off. Recommendation: read Welles...fat dead men are always a kick."
3,the ideas are great; the execution is lacking,"Okay, I won't deny that Bester was absolutely overflowing with incredible ideas (second, perhaps, only to Philip K. Dick), but the implementation here is not as good as it should be. The book has kind of a choppy feel to it, as if Bester was incapable of implementing his ideas while retaining a smooth sense of narrative. This is occasionally jaw-dropping, but the presentation hurts it a bit, I think. I would recommend you pick up Virtual Realities instead--Bester is at his best (haha) when his genius is presented in small-but-powerful explosions than when he tries to stretch it over an entire novel."
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"""The Demolished Man"" and some of Bester's short fiction were brilliant. This one is not. A confusing hodgepodge of ideas that never ring true, ""The Stars My Destination"" illustrates what happens when a talented author becomes overly self-indulgent and neglects the requirement of a soundly plotted, clearly written story."
4,Htich your wagon...,"This, quite frankly, is my favorite sci-fi book. Alfred Bester is the hidden genius of sci-fi, overshadowed by the amiable popularity of Heinlein and the visions of Asimov.What Bester does in this and to a lesser extent in the Demolished Man is take a hero and stretch him into an unrecognizable, almost Heathcliffesque proportion. But in that stretch the hero (now anti-hero) is believable and human. Bester is different from his contemporaries (and not at all like his supposed 'heirs' in cyberpunk, but that's a different story) because he uses human emotion as his template, not human sociological patterns, though this is a pattern in his stories. Overall, Bester is by far my favorite speculative author, because he is not afraid to do weird things but also not afraid to make a rapist and vengeful man into a hero."
2,A major disappointment,"Bester is a skilled writer with a keen imagination, and this book has long held a position of awed respect among readers of science fiction. So why was I so disappointed?The major problem: I found the characters repellent. Not just evil -- some of fiction's most memorable characters have been utterly villainous -- but petty, monomaniacal, and (worst of all) boring. Only Gully Foyle, the protagonist, manages to develop into anything resembling an actual human being towards the end of the book; everyone else is made out of smelly cardboard.A second problem is that Bester seems more intent on social commentary than good fiction. This is obviously a matter of taste: those who are fascinated with the political ramifications of advanced technology are much more likely to enjoy this book than those of us who are simply looking for a futuristic story with interesting characters."
5,the greatest,"For the longest time Child Hoods End was my favorite book, beyond reach of anything Ive read. That is until i read Stars My Destination. This book is quick and captivating. It took me less then a week to read it. Just when you think, ""Ill read one more chapter,"" you'll read 10 more. I often felt I was watching a movie in my head when reading this. There is non-stop action and non-stop adventure. The ending is complex and intriguing. I recommend this to anyone who loves adventure and sci-fi. Heck, i recommend this to everyone who can read!"
4,Amazing book wih deep insights that are more applicable today,"I was uncomfortable with Gully Folly's driven vengance but it is the key of the book. It is about human sprit achieves greatness through (mental) drive. The book finds great insight to both social and political depths of it subject matter which add to its great width, it's not about technology but about character (often bizzar), their drives and desires. This why the book is so timeless given that fifty year old technology chatter is often dated but not the interplay of character. If you want a wild bizzar ride of a story pick up this book, it not another boring tech based cyber story. It's well worth for it's deep insight."
2,Assinine,"This book is a jumbled mess. The main character is initially developed as uneducated, unemotional and unreflective clod, which actually interested me! He then goes on to do exactly everything that such a character never would or could do. All of a sudden he is a highly-skilled deep thinker running, get this, a famous interplantetary circus company he founded himself with himself as the leading 'wise clown'. My G_d, did a sixth grader write this?"
2,Disappointed,"After reading all these raving reviews, I expected much more. It started out good but I lost interest quickly. I think it will hold your attention if you're about 12 years old. For really good science fiction, try reading Phillip Dick."
2,Pretty laim; Not worth it,I don't care that this book was written in the 50's; it is still laim. Not worth it.
1,NOT AS GREAT AS YOU'VE BEEN TOLD,"I was hoping for a great book here. Especially after the greatwords from everyone around the world. But in the end, it was ( ). Ithought his reputation would be alive and well, and the glowingdescriptions of Gaiman et al couldn't be wrong. Could they? It was a piece of ( ). if you're looking for some great SF reading check out DUNE or RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA. Skip this. You'll be thankful. END"
5,A sharp is really neat,Great TV. Use it every morning to watch the news as I drink my coffee and prepare for the day. No problems!
4,A Cross-Disciplanary Look at Critical Literacy in Classrooms,"Overall, I found Shor and Pari's edited edition of articles discussing Critical Litearcy to be a good introduction to the variety of ways educators have chosen to implement and define critical literacy pedagogies. This book primarily looks at critical literacy in college level classes, however some mention of work with high school students is also present. I would describe this book as a thorough, though certainly not exhaustive, presentation of both theory and practice as instructors struggle to bring issues of race, class and gender into classrooms. If you are interested in critical litearcy, and curious to see how others have engaged with this topic, this book is both relevent and insightful."
3,Voyage into violence,"Seller is a fast shipper, however, back cover was not attached to book. Would have been nice to know this before I purchased book."
4,They work very well but...,"They are somewhat fragile, so the headphones themselves need to be regularly replaced. Also, there appears to be three or four different types that may only be paired with the correct base or they don't work. That would be fine if each type were clearly labeled, but they are not. I now have two headphones that do not match the base I purchased. I do wish they would clearly label each base and set of extra headphones with a name or color, so this would not happen."
1,TV Ears Headset,"I have used a TV Ears original system for several years and have been extremely satisfied with it. The replacement headset performance was far below that of the original. Range was much smaller, sound quality poorer, and movement or line of sight interference produced considerable static. I was very unhappy with the purchase, and returned it for a refund."
4,TV EARS,"TV Ears are an excellent product for those with hearing problems. The sound is very clear and can be used for both TV and DVD""s.The only problem I have with this product, is that the the plastic strips attached between the ear phones and receiver is not a very durable plastic and tends to break after only a year of use."
1,Worthless book.....avoid,"Not a troubleshooting guide at all. It explains basic electrical systems, something you would get in 6th grade science class! Absolutely junk for troubleshooting....oh wait it would have to have some troubleshooting in it to be junk. Give it too your children to understand elementary electricity."
3,Very Basic,"Not quite what I was expecting, the book is extremely basic. It is really a book of descriptions for everyday items in the HVAC field. Would be an ideal book for students or maintenance techs."
1,Waste of money,"This is a pocket-sized book, printed in blue, that contains a very short review of electrical theory, motors, and starting capacitors. Descriptions are barely longer than what a simple HVAC glossary would provide and are so short that a novice would be confused half the time. No troubleshooting is provided other than basic understanding of principles. No control circuits are covered."
4,Our kids love it,"We have had this video for years. Both of our kids have enjoyed it immensely. Similar to the Baby Mozrt or Baby Bach videos there are random scenes shown, usually of puppets playing and having fun, with a classical music background being played.The purpose of the video is to get the child to hear the classical music. I remember when I was a child watching old cartoons that played classical music in the soundtrack. Years later when I was formally exposed to these musical pieces I recognized them. That is what this tape does. Later as your children grow up they will be able to appreciate the music by itself.Is this tape better than Baby Mozart or Baby Bach? Hardly. In fact, I would probably give this video 3.5 stars and the Baby Mozart and Einstein 4.5 stars (I take off half a star for their blatant marketing of toys to the kids)."
1,LEMON ALERT,"The first of these boomboxes I received was a lemon right out of the box. XM Radio was sending the signal but the boombox showed no signal. I should be able to get at least channel one but the antenna couldn't even pick that up. No signal strength was recorded and the box was a flat-out dud. However, Amazon is sending a replacement right away. Just be warned that you need to check this box out right away."
5,Hidden XT Adapter,"I bought this item for my girlfriend to use with her Roady XT. When she got the package she could not find the adapter to fit her XT. She then found it hiding in the side of an end piece of packing foam. Other than that small issue, the boom box works great. I have used the same one for my SkiFi and SkyFi2 and never had an issue. It has a nice 25 foot antenna cord because you def. have to move it around alot to get decent reception. Delphi makes some good products."
1,Delphi Boom Box,Product arrived dysfunctional.It has an Antenna connection problem and the volume control did not work Was returned and am waiting for a credit.
3,very unsatisfied,Was not what seller advertised it to be. It came missing the adapter for roady xt which after e-mailing him i received a 50.00 refund but after that it would not work until i bought a new adapter and a 12 volt dc plug because he sent some old 9 volt piece of junk that was not for this model of radio.So after all this trouble and 65.00 more and the headaches this was a BAD PURCHASE!
1,Where is It????,It would be nice to review but I never receive this item. I've been charge for it and have responded to Amazon with where is it and get no responds. It been two weeks without any action on Amazon part. I don't recommend doing business with them.
3,Little Boom to the Box,"Portable system design is good, but poor quality sound with no bass or treble controls. The AC Adapter is MASSIVE and heavy."
3,"Okay, not great. Good price I guess.","This is my second boombox by Delphi. My first lasted about a year and then the bass chanel quit working. I don't know if it was in the pre-amp or the speakers, but all I had was treble. Prior to it blowing out, I kept hearing an occasional burst of static, which occurred periodically for about a month. Unfortunately, it happened about a month after the warranty was up. This new box is apparently the upgraded version of the previous model, and so far so good. Except, once in awhile, I hear that burst of static. Also, Delphi hasn't really corrected the low grade hum you can hear when the volume is on mute. This product is a great idea with a lot of potential. I just wish Delphi would pull their heads out of their rear ends and hire some real audio engineers."
3,adequate,Nice having the equipment for home/car/yard flexibility.... but the unit does not produce much volume. Got a good deal so I am satisfied but not thrilled.
3,SO-SO SOUND,Not much volume and no bass or tervle controls. It functions well and the antenna works fine but the sound is flat and weak.
3,delphi boom box,"This is my second unit. Purchased for my office. Great sound. Easy to use. If using with batteries,always remove after use. For some reason the batteries drain if left in unit over time. I've placed batteries in both of my units to be prepared to use out of doors. When I go to use a month ot two later, the batteries are dead. I do understand you are not to leave batteries in devices over extended periods because of possible corrisive leakage, but they should not drain dead."
3,Delphi Boom Box,The Delphi boom box has great sound quality. The total loudness could stand to be a bit louder. But its great for listen while working on the computer.
5,Kenny Chesney and Country Music: A Tennessee Tradition,"This is a great CD. ""Back Where I Come From"", is on of those feel good songs that gives me chill bumps every time I here it. Chesney is a extremely talented artist whose passion is shown in every song. I recommend all his albums."
2,More than a little disappointing,"The story was decent. Two lesbians meet and fall in love. The story takes place on a beautiful ranch and the characters were likable. However, the story receives only 2 stars because of extremely poor writing.I don't appreciate having something repeated over and over and over again. Yes, we know that Lex and her housekeeper love each other and banter a lot. We know this greatly amuses Amanda. We know Lex loves the attention. And this exact same scene was repeated over and over and over and over and over again!!! If you read above a 6th grade level, don't waste your time with this one."
3,Misses elements,"This has been a very frustrating book to work through because it fails to mention key elements in its discussions. Chapter 10 on ""Combining Images"", for example, gives lots of information on how to work with layers, but never explains how to create layers. Incidents like this, and there are a few, are guaranteed to raise your blood pressure."
3,Good product overview BUT,"I purchased the subject book in order to edit photos only. The subject CS2 book provides a good overview of CS2 BUT it DOES NOT provide a step-by-step tutorial on how to use all the CS2 tools. I purchased ""Photoshop CS2 In Easy Steps"" manual ($10) to provide the ""how to"" part. Between the two publications, a good understanding of CS2 for photo processing was provided. It became clear that CS2 is so robust, and therefore complicated, that a CS2 course would be the next logical step."
1,This Book is not for Dummies or Beginners!,"IMO, this is a terrible book for beginners. The structure is non-linear; within the first few pages the author references more advanced Photoshop techniques as if the reader understands what he's referring to.Frankly, I'm surprised the ""for Dummies"" group ever published the book. If you're new to Photoshop, this book will almost certainly confuse & frustrate.It simply is not a text that ""Dummies"" (read beginners) will get much out of. I read the first 3 chapters, and I still had no understanding of Photoshop's basic features.Perhaps it will be a good reference book as I become more adept at Photoshop, but I wanted a book that would teach me the basics.I've found both the ""Photoshop CS2 for Beginners"" DVD and ""Adobe Photoshop CS2 Classroom in a Book"" to be far superior choices for Photoshop novices.If I could rate this book a zero rather than a one, I would."
3,"It truly IS for ""dummies""!","This book covers only the very BASICS of using Photoshop. It is an okay introduction to the program, and a complete beginner may find it useful. However, anyone who has used Photoshop at all will find this book way too simple. And beginners will definitely want to invest in another book to further their learning after this light, Photoshop appetizer. The only thing I really like is the list of keyboard shortcuts in the appendix."
2,Not for beginners,"Judging by the number of people who don't find negative reviews helpful people don't like to hear the truth - that this book is not for beginners. Its a reference book for intemediate users and above and possibly a reference for beginners who are receiving tuition elsewhere - because theres none to be found here.Despite the sneering tone of at least one other revewer here it *is* possible to be a newbie and be serious about learning Photoshop - but not with this book. Do yourself a favor and buy Sams' ""Teach yourself Photoshop CS2 in 24 Hours"" because that *will* teach you how to get to grips with the basics - and avoid this book."
2,Not very useful,"Let me start by saying that I am a total Photoshop newbie. I have only used Microsoft digital imaging suite.I have to say, this book is very lacking in useful information.Basically, this book tells you what things are in Photoshop CS2 but never gives you any useful way to apply it to your images.1. Basically no tips on how to edit RAW images with Photoshop CS2.2. Mentions sharpening but doesn't tell you how best to do it.3. Talks very superficially about masking but never really tells you how to do it.4. It's not until the 5th chapter in the book that you even told anything that would require you to turn on your computer.If you want to know how to use this to improve your family photos, look elsewhere."
3,Pretty Good Cut,I dug the Brothers Johnson style Arrangements going on with this Cut.Van Hunt has talent.this is a Smooth laid-back kind of cut.this cut had a nice vibe to it.
3,It was OK.,"I thought the season finale was kind of lame with Magneto. I like the old X-Men cartoons much more, but these are OK if you're a Marvel or X-Men fan."
2,"Lousy acting, terrible lines","On boy. Lou Diamond Phillips looks like a sissy with his girly-man hair. This supposed Special Unit goes driving around in unmarked cop cars easy to follow. The bad-guys spout the usual foul-mouthed street profanity. Ahhh--- the setups are really stupid. The cop-talk is worse than the perp talk. Oh well. Sucks. Don't bother with this, unless you take it out from a library."
3,Lots of Action and blood,I thought that this is a good movie if you are sick of crimials that get away with the crime. There are a lot of gun fire and they have a good cast. Lou Diamond is a very rough guy but he can be calm and nice when he wants to be.
2,Not to be taken seriously,"This movie has all the stereotypical, flat characters of any renegade cop movie-- a hard-nosed female reporter, loose cannon rookie... even the dialogue is predictable. The only redeeming quality of this movie is how much fun it is to watch it with a big group of nerds shouting witty comments at the screen a la Mystery Science Theater."
3,A rough one,I didn't care for this one. I got it because LDP was in it but he has better ones.Too much senseless violence.The acting was good but just not my kind of movie.
4,VERY QUESTIONABLE - REALITY OR NOT?,"I have always [almost] admired Scott Glenn and Lou Diamond Phillips. But this story of rogue cops [and there may more reality than we care to admit] allowing the perps to commit the crime in order to have a justifiable killing is a bit gross.As I contend, movies are just entertainment for the most part, but you sure love to hate these characters.I normally don't like anything to happen to Scott's character but I thought he got justice done to him.And yes, again, who made man God. Men like to think that their word is law but, boy, think again.I guess I want to say, I am glad not to be in that position but the perps need a bit of chastizement barring innocent victims, let the vigilantes be killers and not protected law enforcers.Ah well, this is not a movie for teen-agers [they already have tooo many ideas of their own and not all are practical]- for mature? audiences only."
5,One of the best picture books ever!,"I use picture books to introduce various units to my high school English class. A Weave of Words is one of the best ""fairy tale"" books I've ever read, with enough twists to keep high school freshmen interested. The illustations are top quality, and the spunky heroine is a great role model for girls who are trying to find their own identity. The hero begins as a something of a bore, but grows in character and depth."
5,wonderful,This is a book from my childhood and i wanted to pass it on to my grandkids. It was so wonderful to see it for sale and it came to me in decent condition and in a timely fashion. it was as described ..........the story is a bit different from that of my childhood ...the one I had read was in a book called A Mountain of Gems....That being said this book was in Excellent condition My grandaughters has read it twice now
3,Armenian?,"All three of my starts go toward the plot of the fairy tale. I purchased the book, because my husband is Armanian, and I thought he would get a charge out of reading it to my daughter. So little of the tale was really Armenian. The names weren't truly Armenian, nor some of the village names. Though, the concept that the tail revolves around the woven rug is true to Armenian households. Definately purchase the book for the quality of the tale, but don't buy it because of it having an Armenian ""Tweek""."
5,Kids love this one,Great CD for the price. Songs repeat in split-trax format. Encourages Christian values.
5,A very accurate map,"Having never been to Mallorca, we purchased this before our trip. It was incredibly accurate which made driving in an unfamiliar area so much easier. Yes I had GPS, but after the car was parked we had a reference point."
3,The first Trinity Field Report...,"...provided some very important information that wasn't detailed in the rulebook: info about Karoo, Averiguas, Far Nyumba and the other extrasolar colonies. All the infomation is in full color and in-character, much like the first 100 pages of the basic rulebook. Most of the info found here has been expanded in other books (particularly Stellar Frontier and the Alien Encounter adventure series), but it's still very cool as a player handout."
5,The perfect spiral for a busy woman!,"Okay, I was little skeptical at first...I've tried many spiral rollers in the past that were uncomfortable and would make the ends of my hair look ""knotted"" if my hair was not at just the right level of dampness when I rolled it. But, not these. I read the review above prior to purchasing them and hoped for the best...well, to say the least, I absolutely love them! Not only are they easy to use, easy to sleep in, and easy to remove....they do a wonderful job in curling my hair! Whether your hair is short or long...these are rollers to buy!!!! You will get perfect spirals all the time......"
2,Not the Best Truffaut,"I kept waiting for something to happen in this movie. But it's just the story of a girl, who likes to steal small stuff. I really expected more from Truffaut, who wrote the screenplay. Although I am not familiar with her work, Charlotte Gainsbourg, who plays the lead character, is fun to see. Not enough though, to recommend this movie to anybody."
3,It has its moments...,"Charlotte Gainsbourg is excellent as the ""little thief"". However, I found the movie a little boring. Till the end I waited for something to happen... and nothing did... It's somewhat interesting as a character study though, and the film has its moments. Francois Truffaut wrote the screenplay (original)."
2,Poor format,"This book offers a wealth of information but the format is terrible and misspelled words are a frequent find. Mr. Reynolds is extremely inconsistent throughout the entire book, interchanging words such as univentricle and single ventricle anatomy within the same chapter. There is no index which makes any quick search impossible. The binding used for the handbook is of very poor quality. Both the front and back covers ripped within 4 weeks of normal use and had to be taped on."
4,A Story That Had to be Told,"Bob Wills had such a huge impact on both popular and country music that his story needed to be told and this video does a great job of telling that story.I remember seeing Bob Wills ""soundies"" in movie theaters and I wish a couple of these could have been included...shown in their entirety."
2,Extended?,"Apparently BMG's The Encore Collection Extended Versions is a generic title for budget releases of live recordings of known musicians. From the same Chicago 2001 concert that produced the far superior Ringo & His New All Starr Band (King Biscuit) album, this album repeats four Ringo tracks, adding only It Don't Come Easy, and adds previously unreleased tracks by Greg Lake (Karn Evil 9, better known as Welcome Back My Friend To The Show That Never Ends), Ian Hunter (I Still Love Rock 'n' Roll), Sheila E. (Love Bizarre and reprises her Glamorous Life from the earlier release), and Howard Jones (Everlasting Love).You have to ask yourself how much of a Drumhead you are."
1,The circus act,"When is somebody going to point out to Ringo that he's being used like a circus freak? The guy that puts his All-Starr thing together - I can't remember his name - is using his good name and the goodwill of fans to make a buck. As another fan wrote right here, enough already! Ringo is turning into a shameless nostalgia act - the same old stuff, year after year, more CDs. The 2003 All-Starrs I saw put on one of the worst shows I've ever sat through, and there's poor old Ring out front, alternately looking so arrogant and thrilled by the whole thing. What he needs is a real band (the Roundheads? I'm not so sure Mark Hudson isn't using him the same way) and a real, all-Ringo show. These things have become redundant and ridiculous."
1,No more live Ringo please!!!,"Ringo Starr and his allstar band releases, are beginning to get out of hand. We have already seen four single disc variations of the band released, not to mention the 3 disc live set as well? Let us not forget two DVD releases as well. This latest single disc release is billed as live extended versions, and features a few tunes from Sheila E, Ian Hunter and Howard Jones, and they are supplemented by the usual Ringo Starr tunes that we have already heard a thousand other times on his previous live releases. This is just a horrible bargin bin priced cd, that should go out of print very quickly. His shows are entertaining with the allstars, but enough already, with releasing the same old live tunes over and over again. If you need live Ringo bad enough, I recommend the 3 disc live set, which is all you will ever need to properly appreciate Ringo and his all-stars."
2,"It's YOUR money, but just be forewarned","OK, most of the tracks here are available elsewhere. It was nice to ""hear"" ""Karn Evil"" after we'd seen Greg Lake do it - BUT the ONLY OTHER REASON for purchasing this CD, allegedly, Ian Hunters's ""Still Love Rock And Roll"" is...just...NOT: Actually, the song on the CD is that ancient ""Irene Wilde"" which was mildly interesting 32 years ago (with Jaco Pastorius, Chris Stainton & Ansley Dunbar), but after hearing/owning the live 1980 version with Mick Ronson & the ""Welcome To The Club"" band....well, let's just say that one Greg Lake song on ""Extended"" does not justify having any more Sheila E & Howard Jones inflicted on you."
2,Worth it if only for SHEILA!!,"I stopped buying the live All-Starr cds after the third one. But I couldn't pass this up for the low price. Considering that, it's very much worth it. I understand there the previous All-Starr live disc has half of this material, so if you have that this may not be such a great buy. But I was happy to snag it for six bucks. I saw one of the shows from this tour, and it really was a good line-up (expect for Howard Jones). Sheila E. really stole the show right from Ringo. She's a great drummer and a great performer. This disc has both songs she did, and they are the highlights of the disc."
1,This Album Don't Exist,"this album is not a ringo starr album, have other title and are varios performer"
4,SHOCKING MOVIE,"This is probably what goes in the mind of alot of young people when they are bullied and pushed around by the neighborhood thug. Everyone at a time was bullied by someone that they wish a truck would have hit them. This movie was great, but i do agree with alot of the other reviews - the director obviously 'gets off' on showing young teenagers nude. In the movie Kids I could understand why they would show nudity, but from what I see ALL of this directors movies has some adolescent type nudity to it."
1,Run me over again while you're at it.,"plotline with spoilers....A. Friend #1 goes nuts and assaults a female friend #2B. Friends #2-6 conspire to get back at friend #1C. Friends #2-6 KILL Friend #1 in a swampD. Friends #2-6 go to jailThe rest of the plot dealt with my sould getting run over by the screenplay due to its tone and graphic scenes. If this sounds like a walk in the park for you, then you might like Bully. Telling you it was inspired by True Events might make you even more giddy.Enjoy."
1,SICK,"ONE OF THE SICKEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. TEENAGERS THAT COULD MURDER ANOTHER HUMAN BEING DESERVE TO BE HUNG AT THE END OF A NOOSE IN THE STREET FOR ALL TO SEE. THE SAD PART ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS IT IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY, THE STORY OF BOBBY KENT."
3,it held my attention,not alot of films hold my attention but this one had alot of things going on&unfolding that I wanted to watch it all the way through. very dramatic&so much tension that you were wodering what was gonna happen next.
3,"Powerful film, though inaccurate","I just saw this film, real powerful stuff, though I must say it is inaccurate - there was no eighth teenager who played a role the murder, and I believe Larry Clark should have hired an actor who had ""Middle-Eastern"" features to play Bobby Kent as he was the son of prominent Iranian immigrants. Also it was biased in favor of the killers because most likely the film storyline was based on the court transcripts and the accounts from the killers. In some way we really don't know exactly what caused Marty Puccio and Lisa Connelly to kill Bobby Kent. But in some way the actions of Bobby Kent in the movie would've driven anyone to extremes. More so taking into account Kent's Middle-Eastern background Kent is probably the teenage Osama Bin Laden though he deals his terrorism in smaller doses."
2,whats up with larry clark?,"to the director larry clark: youre not filming an episode of nypd blue- hold the camera steady! oh, and if there is an object b/w u and your subject such as a household plant or fence, MOVE THE CAMERA TO A DIFFERENT ANGLE! and clark seems pre-occupied with young naked actors. like he will shoot an actress completely naked in a scene for no reason at all! i dunno.. this movie builds up to the killing, but after the film has finished, it just ends up making u feel empty. good, strong performance by renfro tho."
3,Disturbing,"'Bully' is an odd little movie and there obviously is an audience for the thing, though I found it far from convincing. We do need to know/feel what is the driving behaviour of its parents and adolescents. But the film is virtually pre-or anti psychological, and I don't mean in a blow-by-blow, condecending analysis of the character's motives. There are significant gaps in understanding or self refection going on, in the head of the director. The kids act well enough, save for the guy that is a late ring in on the fatal act, and whose entry is marked by a terrible 360o swirling of the camera on his front lawn. He simply doesn't fit the killer mode.The story guarantees our voyeuristic complicity to the end but leaves huge, nagging questions, not the least of which is the role of this film in perpetuating the problems it seeks to elucidate."
3,"explicit, brutal and raw. A in your face picture","this one goes all out. You got a lot of nekkidness in this flick, mostly towards these girls(Bijou Phillips and Rachel Miner). You got a perfect, straight A student(Nick Stahl) who's hobbies include bullying people, rape and watching gay porn movies. You got his friend(Brad Renfro) who's a surfer, dropped out of school and is pushed too the limit by his friend and he wants out, so him and his other friends(Michael Pitt, Kelli Garner and the fat guy), along with a hitman(Leo Fitzpatrick from KIDS fame), plan the bully's death. they end up, bashing, slashing and diceing him up, dumping his body somewhere and then swearing they wont tell, but some promises do break. Soon, they all end up getting arrested and brought to court where their anger and rage are brought before their parents and siblings. Very brutal, explicit. Clark goes way beyond the border here. Recommended for fans of Clark. others beware"
1,this is a great movie IF ...,"you'll love this dvd IF you want to see a bunch of under-age kids who are constantly strung out on drugs, use the F word at least three times in every sentence they utter, have illicit sex in every other scene, and thrive on violence as if it were commonplace ... not to mention the most naive parents ever seen on film."
1,Bull is what it should be called,"If you want to indulge in the Larry Clarks fantasyof teenage sex, drug use, homosexuality, and violencethen you will enjoy watching this garbage.Bully has no redemptive quality. All the characterscould be killed or arrested within the first 15 minutesand then we could go out and watch some real films.Maybe people do live like this- but do we need tobe subjected to it. Pass on this movie."
3,"Good movie, but some important details were left out.","I enjoyed the movie when i saw it, but I knew there was something missing to the story. Then, I happened to see the A & E true story about this. Turns out that Marty may have been being molested by Bobby. When Marty decided he didn't want to be gay with Bobby anymore Bobby started making threats and being forceful with him. So, not only was Bobby date raping women, but he may have also raped Marty as well. With this concoction added to the fire, it's a little easier to see why Marty and others may have snapped the way they did. What a sad, sad story."
5,leaves a mark...,"Good film, the kind where after it's over you feel somehow affected by it and when that wears off and you drift back into reality, from this chaotic 2 hour trip you just had, it definately will leave its mark in your memory (a la Kids.) Definately worth the time and money... and one of the few movies I've gone and ordered right after watching I liked it that much. Fairly disturbing as well though (Requium For a Dream-esque.) Go ahead and at least rent it..."
3,"Self-Important, Not Important","There's something comically--and, perhaps, miserably--self-important about ""Bully,"" starting with its proposition that although kids die every day in the inner city and in poor rural areas, it's when such deaths occur in the affluent white suburbs that we're supposed to take notice. Maybe the term I'm looking for isn't ""self-important"" but ""self-indulgent,"" as there's no doubt that ""Bully"" is that, too. But separating what is intentional and ironic in this approach versus what is simply nacissistic and exploitative is difficult. I guess that leaves the miscreants themselves the intended audience--if so, is the film supposed to indulge their narcissism? With his semi-documentary approach, Clark stops short of giving the story any kind of moral perspective, which only adds to the sense that the audience is supposed to be titillated rather than enriched by ""Bully."" In the end, I was neither."
4,Very Real and true,"I didn't even know this movie was a true story until after I saw it. Then when I read about what happened in real life, I had a new appreciation for this film because it stayed so true to the real story and did a great job developing the characters. It's about a teenager going nowhere in life, Marty (Brad Renfro), who is being bullied by his supposed best friend, Bobby. Bobby bullies everybody, he's raped Marty's girlfriend and her best friend. As a result, Marty and a group of friends decide that the world would be a better place if they murdered Bobby. The film is really graphic, in violence and sexuality. It's very realistic and touching. If you liked the movie ""Kids"", you should like this movie. It's less like a documentary than ""Kids"" and has more of a story."
4,EXCELLENT,"The DVD has cast interviews on it but no director's commentary. That's good since Mr. Clark's commentary track on ""Another Day In Paradise"" was one of the very worst I have ever heard."
3,never underestimate the power of stupid children.,"I watched this movie last night and did not know until today that it was based on a true story.I have a hard time believing that upper class Florida suburb kids qualify as actual gang members, although I won't dispute that they probably were involved in some, if not all, of the activities shown in the film. The film did not portray the kids as gangbanging thugs but as children with too much money and too little supervision. The teenagers in the film are portrayed as virtually brainless and illogical, like caricatures of adolescence.I saw the 'R-rated' version rather than the NC-17 original, but the R-rated had more than enough gratuitous nudity and brutal rape and abuse scenes. I really felt like it was just a remade version of 'KIDS' set in Florida instead of New York with more nudity and a murder added in. I'd rent it or find a way to view it before buying it."
3,BULLY,"Did not see the director's cut. Would strongly advise getting it over the theatrical release. All in all, the movie wasn't bad, the acting...on the part of Brad Renfro and Nick Stahl was excellent.Photography was so-so. Sound track was good. It was obvious that the movie had deleated scenes. Get the director's cut, if possible."
4,Murder in South Florida,"Loosely based on the story of a teenage revenge killing. South Florida brat Bobby Kent verbally, physically and psychologically abuses his nudnick friend Marty Puccio as a matter of routine...Viewers of this film will find an exaggerated vision of adolescent America; life is a big carnival of alcohol, drugs, crime, and promiscuity. Parental figures have all the presence of the faceless trumpet-voiced adults of a &#65533;Peanuts&#65533; cartoon. Larry Clark returns to his fascination with the naked, hairless, prepubescent male torso many times, and extensive full nude scenes feature Rachel Minor as Lisa and Bijou Phillips as Ali. Clark&#65533;s camera crawls all over the young actresses&#65533; bodies like the eyes of a leering pervert. ...While there are no underdogs to cheer for in Bully, to his acting credit you almost root for Nick Stahl as Bobby until he opens his mouth again or punches somebody. Most of the acting performances are engaging as well..."
4,My verdict,"I watched this film last night not knowing what to expect. It has quite a few characters and deals with a storyline which is difficult to predicate. It is not sappy,preachy or anything but more of a matter of fact film. It's for people who like watching films on teenage angst. What prompted me to watch this film? Imdb.com suggested I should watch it if I liked ""The Squid and the whale"" which by the way is a more recent film. I think people in their late teens and early twenty's might like this film just because it is very human. Or atleast a part of how human's think and behave under specific circumstances of being ""pushed"" aroundBottomline, watch it if you intend to watch a somewhat graphic adult film on teen-angst. Overall Score - 7/10ps - I think the villain's character was well sketched out and portrayed. He was also my favourite character for he acted so well. Cheers."
5,what some teens will do...,"I found this movie to be intense. I will say this much parents out there with teens, I realize the drugs nudity and sex in the movie are not for some teens eyes but this being based on TRUE EVENTS maybe its something they need to see. I only say this because of peer pressure and what it could make a teen do. When you talk to your teens do they hear you sometimes they need to see it first hand to get the idea. The movie itself was very well made. Poor marty he should have just done something else, anything else, but his girlfriend lisa nagging and wanting her way about it, not only detroys martys life but others as well. This is a great movie I think you should watch it."
1,More Larry Clark,"More of Larry Clark's use of a poorly executed ""art"" film in order to mainstream what is basically kiddy porn (his favorite subject). Bully, Kids, etc. are just opportunities for Larry to linger over the scantily clad torsos of young boys under the guide of a movie (usually with a plot and writing as skimpy as the clothes)."
1,gratuitous,"This intermitably slow moving film has no redeeming qualities. Between the horrid shooting style (spin the camara around a group of kids more than 10 times at a high rate of speed) and the gratuitus crotch shots, nude scenes and pointless sex, this movie was just a mis-filed porn flick.There was no point to this film, it could have been a disturbing look into teen angst, the problems of rampant bullying, or drug use. Instead he just lays out the story of stupid kids doing stupid things for stupid reasons in a stupid film. A little more character development would have been nice. In the special features we learn that many of the kids have really painful pasts. The film would have done well to reduce the number of pointless sex scenes and focused on these kid's motivation and pain."
3,"A LIFE-LIKE AND ENGROSSING FILM, NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART","I'd give it a 3.5 if I could. Great acting. Good pace. Interesting (and true) story. Adds up to a good movie. The acting deserves special mention, it was truly outstanding. While the movie's unique device is to tell the story dispassionately, I still balk at the lack of character development. The only social angle we get on our bored suburban teenage protagonists is that they have a lot of sex, use drugs, play video games, and just generally remain shallow and naive.That said, the climax is alarming, incredibly raw, and definitely nerve-racking. Overall, Bully is a life-like and engrossing film, yet incomplete in its story, and should NOT be viewed by those who are easily offended or upset by bizarre, grotesque, or graphic violence, sexual imagery/dialogue in film."
5,An excellent movie...,"I didn't expect to like this movie, I saw Kids and didn't think it was that great. But this movie is different and in my opinion much more sophisticated in it's execution. I didn't know until after I'd seen the feature that it is based on a true story. The acting on each charachter's parts was superb. Nich Stahl, who played Bobby (the murder victim) was able to instill repulsion as well as sympathy for his charachter. This actually is the case for all the players (except Marty who was so heinous...). What I don't like about this movie is that the actors are for the most part ridiculously beautiful and/or sexy. The real people are not. I don't know that they (the real life perps) would be able to generate as much sympathy as their thespian counterparts. I recommend. Not for the bible thumping or easily offended crowd."
3,Ahhite,"I just didn't care for the movie itself. Never had seen it before, just a cheap movie with an all-star cast. It was ok. Thanks for the speedy delivery..."
1,"Good for entertainment value , however accounts are false","Ok this movie is good , but thats if it isn't supposed to be about the real Marty Puccio. He was completly misrepresented in it as well as the others . So if you are going to buy this hoping to get the real story of what happened to Bobby Kent then don't waste your money . Marty himself has sadi the book is 90% false and majority of the scenerios they set are lies. The movie is based on the book so that should tell you something . I began a support group for Marty or anyone who wants to come discuss the case and learn more . http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freemartypuccio/"
1,Please DON'T see this movie,"This film is by far the worst movie I have seen all year. The only thing holding me down in my chair during what seemed like years and years in the theatre was the thought that i had paid nearly ten dollars to see it. pornographic camerawork and shoddy production (at one point i could definitely see a boom mike) aside, the characthers and plot of this movie is entirely inconsequential. the stupidity and one dimensional nature of the kids in this movie are never condemned while careful, almost reverent attention is paid to their bodies. the result feels like the director planned to slap the audience in the face with the raw, blank, frustrating animal nature of these teenagers. not entertaining, definitely not thought provoking and revoltingly unsexy, this movie is even too bad to be treated as a joke."
3,Insteresting teen movie,"Bully was interesting to a degree it looked upon the life of a troubled teen and perhaps what any teen's life might be, the movie dealt with frustrations many teens might feel, the sexual encounters looked to be about what teen his age might be undertaking and having to deal with a lifelong bully seemed Plausible. The movie seemed to be based on what a teen might think, his judgements, thoughts, and the way a teen might view the world, not realizing any serious consquences for his actions. This movie has many sexual situations and nudity, male and female which might give it higher box office revenues, but using these scenes was necessary, it showed what I suspect is a very real life of a teen, though most of us parents don't want to admit it. The teens final Solution (it's safe to say) is not what most teens experience."
5,Bully - Based On True Story In Florida,"Bully stars Brad Renfro (Apt Pupil) and Nich Stahl. These two characters grew up together. Nick Stahl's character is a bit of a sadistic bully. Brad's character takes the abuse because he doesn't know what to do about it...until he gets a girl friend who despises the bully. The girlfriend plots the murder of him and manages to pull all the other characters into it. Very, very dumb teenagers who can't seem to think 30 minutes into the future.This movie has lots of sex and violence including rape. Full frontal nudity of females and partial frontal nudity of males.The movie is worth seeing but at the end, you'll be shaking your head finding it hard to believe that people exist who are that dumb. There are. It's a true story."
3,Tried too hard to be shocking...,"There were times when I liked this movie and it felt real to me. There were other times when I thought, ""this acting is really bad"" and ""this is dragging."" I thought that Nick Stahl (the actual bully) was amazing as always, but there were times when i didn't believe the Brad Renfro character and his girlfriend. Too much of the movie spent time talking about killing the guy and not enough time doing it and dealing with it. I don't believe that throwing a lot of sex, drugs, and kinky behavior can take the place of a good story and acting. I recommend that you watch Larry Clark's ""Kids"" instead, which is so real that I thought it was a documentary rather than fiction."
4,pleasantly quirky,"is the best way to describe this film.Adrienne Shelly directs herself and a cast of not well known actors in a story or a temporary insanity with homocidal twists.The plot revolves around Donna,an unemployed manhattanite who may or may not have witnessed a murder.On top of it,she is surrounded by a bunch of loons,including a new boyfriend with a potency problem and honesty issues,an obsessive landlord,love troubled best friend and a disturbingly pessimistic psychic.To sum up,it a short,cute,off-beat flick.Enjoy."
2,"boring, very blurry picture","I thought this movie was rather boring, which I regret to say given that I very much like Adrienne Shelly and most of her work.Also, the picture was very blurry/low-resolution."
2,dry read,"Sorry Microsoft; this book was so dull it hurts. At first I thought it would be jam packed with ideas, but really only the first couple of chapters had anything good, after that it was just rehashed over and over again."
2,Horribly out of date,"This book needs a more current edition and fast. Written in 2004, this book covers ASP.NET 1.1 and early ADO technology. Even some of its best advice is no applicable. They actually discourage collections in favor of arrays - something that is inconceivable in .NET 4 with LINQ and Entity Framework.Even forgiving the outdated advice, this book was heavy on the hand waving and there were few concrete examples. It really assumes you already know most everything about the key technologies, so it leaves implementation up to your imagination.An even better idea would be to create a series of books on specific technologies rather than trying to be a catch all for the entire .NET platform.The only reason I didn't give it a single star, was because I managed to get it through a company library for free."
3,Suspenseful but has its problems,"This was a strange book for me as there were a lot of things I didn't like but I'll admit it kept me interested until the end. The author did a good job of keeping you guessing and there was enough suspense to make you keep reading. However, the ending was a big letdown as was the eventual unveiling of the killer. The author also needs to work on making at least some of her characters likable. Sarah, the main protagonist was indeed psychologically screwed up but she was also a jerk. The two cops on the case were idiots and almost every ancillary character was unlikable."
4,Absolutely edge of your seat thriller!,"Reader is kept guessing until the very end as to the identity of the killer, who is very conniving and calculating. Definitly a must-read for all thriller fans. Can't wait for a similar novel by Elise Title."
5,!!!Thrilling!!!,"This is a great suspenseful story, absloutely worth reading if you like psychological mysteries and likable heroines!"
5,An excellent thriller in a day of so many bad ones.,"This was a major suspense thriller with so many twists you are left wondering how she did it. You never suspect the culprit, just everyone else. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves a good thriller and even to those who don't."
5,"A dynamite ""page-turner""","I want to let all those readers out there who are looking for that heart-stopping thriller you just can't put down that ""Romeo"" is the one. Yes! Yes! Yes!"
2,Talk About Disappointment!,"A very good friend of mine told me of this particular book, Romeo. She said, ""It will keep you guessing till the end."" Well, I suppose she was right, however, after the first 100 pages I really didn't care anymore. The story tries to be like other great suspense novels such as, Kiss The Girls. I found that the characters were not likeable at all, with very flat personalities. The only reason the book keeps you guessing is because it is always pointing to someone else new who may or may not be the killer, Romeo. I see that many people did like this book and that is fine. But to me, the book was in NO way challenging enough. I highly recommend Jeffrey Deaver or James Patterson if fast-paced suspense is what you desire."
1,Made for TV movie,"I also read this book upon the advice of a friend - we obviously have different tastes. I found the dialogue badly written, the characters overly dramatic (lots of fists pounding on tables, falling to one's knees, etc.), like it was written with the hopes of it being turned into a TV movie one day. Not at all ""erotic"". The characters were flat and unbelievable, as were the situations in which they were placed (many of these characters were connected by the ""coincidence"" of childhood abuse). The author obviously tried to lead her readers into thinking certain characters were guilty, which didn't add a sense of suspense."
3,"Very dry material, hard to keep interested.","When I bought this book I was hoping to enjoy a thriller that would keep me up nights. The book promised suspense, but it did not deliver. The first thirty or so pages were interesting, when you are introduced to all the characters and the promise of suspense to come. I really thought Sarah was great and I loved her disabled gay friend!! However, this book went on for 500 pages when it could have been a perfect book at under 400 pages. It got too repetitive... Sarah is upset, goes to psychiatrist, Sarah gets letter from Romeo, she gets upset, goes to detectives, then the next day goes to psychiatrist again...BORING!!!"
4,A Bit Dark,"Ugh, she does a great job with the violence, slash by slash detail. The book deals with some rather dark topics so be prepared for that. On the brighter note the book is good. The author does a very credible job with the character development, especially the women victims. I would have liked more insight into the killer. The main character has so much personal baggage you believe she would want to get into this world. If you are looking for a mystery that is a light I would not pick this book up. If you are looking for a book that takes on some issues we normaly do not get a lot of detail on then this is a good book for you."
5,Romeo will seduce you,This is an amazing book. I highly recomend it to anyone that's into psychological thrillers. It will keep you going from page one to the end.
1,One Word: Boring,I've read the book in german and I must say: One of the most boring book I read last year. It is nothing else but a simple whodunit. Especially the lead character Sarah is so bad that I wished Romeo would kill her very soon.
1,uhm.. no,"A waste of my 7 bucks. I am confused as to how this book got compared to books by Thomas Harris. I suppose if you are into finding unity through incest, childhood abuse and suicide this book may be your cup of tea. If not... skip it."
1,Do Not Waste Time,1. No characters.2. No plot.3. No erotica4. No reason to waste your timeA book written by marketers.Don't buy it. Don't read it.
2,Roll your own...,"Duct tape is one of my essential travel, camping or backpacking items, but it's amazing anyone can charge so much for so little! In a minute or two, you can roll 20+ feet of your own duct tape around a short pencil and have your own 'travel duct tape' for pennies. Better yet, roll it around an empty Rx bottle, and fill the bottle with a homemade sewing kit.Also, I prefer 3M's clear duct tape, especially when traveling. It's strong and it blends in better."
5,Just The Right Size,"In the past, I've had to cut my duct tape down the middle and roll it up on one end while unrolling it from the original spool. This little package has put an end to those days. Now I can have my mending tape wherever I go without the labor it used to cost me."
5,Upgrade a Manhasset music stand,"I use a Shaft Lock because the rattle of an older Manhasset stand irritates me. Without the Shaft Lock the stand rattles every time I touch it and the sound is a distraction, especially when making a recording. If a music stand won't stay at the height one selects this Shaft Lock keeps it in place at any point one chooses. I bought these for two musician friends and am sure that it will increase the pleasure and convenience of their performing."
3,Shaft Lock allows heavy music book loading,"It definitely does allow you to load up the music stand with lots of books. I'm glad I got it. The down side is that even with the lock ""off"" it adds considerable drag to the movement. Also, it was not obvious how to operate it without a little experimentation."
2,skip this DVD---very few famous moments in sports shown,"The title should have been: ""Evel Knievel and Auto Racing"". I was hoping for the great moments in TV sports history, with many different sports shown. Instead, all I saw was about 5 or more minutes of Evel Knievel and 5 or more minutes of auto racing, but zero minutes of swimming, skiing, boxing, baseball, basketball, hockey, football etc. etc. It feels like they put very little time into making a exciting sports product that showed the best of sports over the last 40 years. I was very disappointed."
4,GOOD FOR THE PRICE,"I got this amp pushing 2 Jbl 12s. did not know what to expect, it pushes them pretty good. The amp is good for the price but it is Definitely not 500 watts RMS x 2 by any means. Anyone that knows anything about car audio will know that to get the true RMS is the voltage coming from the battery times the Ampes on the AMP. At best, This Lanzar will put out a TRUE 576 RMS(40 amp fuse X 14.4 volts = 576), and that is through both channels. It gets the job done, though. Overall, i really like the amp and I would recommend this to friend"
4,good buy,"i gave this amp 4 stars cause it is a great amp 4 the money. but turned all the way up it overheats turn the knobs on the amo down and jam all day it makes my rear view miroror rattle one 4. with my 12"" sony explodes"
5,Wisdom of the Ages,"Hilarious from from to back. This is one of the only ""spirituality"" books whose lessons I actually remember, sort of the same way I remember the verses from bathroom walls. The Profit is an important part of my library."
3,Original DirtyPair -project 'Edit' not Eden,"Disappointed with voice changes and dialogue/script, lacks the excitement of VHS release, the characters 'personalities' seem altered, and stiff, scenes from original are edited out (why?) very little comedic comradery between Kei & Yuri, as a fan of DP it wasn't broke why fix it! Re-release unedited original VHS to DVD."
2,It was painful to watch,"I haven't seen the original Dirty Pair, but I have the Dirty Pair Flash series and love it. That made this movie very painful to watch. I realize that I probably need to see the original Dirty Pair to understand this movie completely, but the reason I disliked this movie were the animation quality and the voice acting. The animation is awful, and bad voice acting. Wendee Lee is a good voice actress in most things like Haruhi Suzumiya, but this movie didn't benefit at all from her performance. I advise anyone thinking about watching this to reconsider."
5,Vary big super fun!!!,"Much Americans clam to misunderstand Nippon Anime. Such silly! Anime great more sensical that large-cost ""Godzilla"" movie from a small number of years ago. True pale impersonation of Gojira, to talk the least. Demonstrating that true Japan entertainment cannot be intimated.Story and graphics capture attention, convoy message on supersense level! Worth every penney, so numerous layers to enjoyment!The Dirty Pair, Kei plus Yuri, are extremity beautiful and give my intense personal simulation. The music tunes are vibrate and catching.You will like! Massive joy for you, cowboy!"
1,Project Eden Disappointment,"I'm a big fan of the Dirty Pair series. This movie just uses the names, drawings and voices but somehow the writers decided not to use the personalities created in the original series. It was a major disappointment."
5,Awesome!,"This show is a classic. It is amazing, and it is well worth the watch. You will love the characters, you won't be able to not. It's one of the shows that will sneak into your heart and make itself at home."
3,Super Reader,"In this book Orion has another, different antagonist that his god-like avatar runners want him to deal with. This time the being is named Set, you know, the serpent god guy. This whole reptile control thing lets him be a dinosaur master. Now, really, this is pretty cool. Who wouldn't want to be a dinosaur master?Orion still has to find some way to deal with him though."
3,I liked the historical settings but could do without Aliens,"Orion in the Dying Time continues the tale of Orion (the Hunter), this time sent back to do battle with Set, an evil reptilian alien on whom all the legends of Satan are based. Unfortunately, in the Dying Time was not nearly as intriguing as the first two novels in the series. The alien Set is not a very interesting opponent and the seemingly unfair advantage he has over the humans in virtually every situation is somewhat ridiculous. Orion even travels back to the Cretaceous Period to do battle with Set (Set created the dinasaurs much the same way that the Creators created human beings). The ending of Orion in the Dying Time was shaping up to be very interesting with Orion using his developing powers to bring 1000 Mongol warriors back in time to do battle with Set, but they didn't even get involved in the final outcome."
4,Nice price,With this I save a lot of money and easy to install and removed my windows stay clear. I received my order fast and price is so good last year I bought same product localy and I paied over 30$.
2,Never Ending Bugs,This game is a bad mix of Hero's Quest and Final Fantisy and its riddles with bugs.
2,Crashes almost as much as it plays,"The game is good and I have patched it already but it still crashes back to windows so if you do play it save often, like after every battle. The graphics are ok but not great and the storyline is very good. I really doubt you will ever finish the game though as the crashes get boring after a while. But the price was right for this game and when it plays, it plays well."
1,Never buy NeverEnd,I could not make it through 15 minutes of play on this game ever for the 6 dollars it was not worth it. I have been playing computer games since the early 80's and this has got to be one of the worse 3 games I have ever played. Beware this one.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I purchased this gane recently. I thought it was a great deal, seeing as how it only cost around -30 cents-. I saw the low price and was in the middle of another order of a few other games, so I threw this one in with the order with a ""Eh, why not, whats the worst that could happen?"" How wrong I was. This game implements some of the worst coding I have -ever- seen, with hundreds of glitches, bugs, and other problems. I have never been so disgusted with any videogame ever. I played 15 minutes into this game, and after three crashes, just quit and uninstalled it. This is the first (and probably last) time in my life I have ever have bought something for less than fifty cents and wanted my money back for it."
3,"Lovely, but expect eventual scars on the satin finish.","This is a lovely set, but the satin finish won't last forever - if the finished sides come into contact friction with edges, they will scar, and that beautiful satin finish ends up looking like a silver-scale Van Gogh."
3,Oneida Mercer,"I think the design of this set is great. When I first got it I put it in the dishwasher. I noticed after that there were a few places on the matt finish that seemed to have rubbed off a bit, most likely from hitting up against each in the dishwasher. I took the backside of one of the spoons and scratched it a bit with a fork prong and it affected the matt finish. I guess I will have to be careful with them and always remember to wash by hand."
4,GREAT!,"I ordered these for my new kitchen & was pleased with the overall look. They are not decorative, but very classy/sleek."
5,Excellent portrayal of novelist George Sand,"This movie depicts the writer George Sand, a French female writer who wrote under a man's name. Judy Davis does an excellent job of portraying this rebellious, exhuberant historical figure. Sand's outrageous exploits will make you laugh and her romance with romantic composer Chopin will make you sigh wistfully. Highly recommend."
4,Who knew Hugh Grant had it in him?,"Hugh Grant = Chopin, in what world? =) This one, apparently. Playing a neurotic, brilliant hypochondriac with a Chopinian accent is right up his alley in this film. Judy Davis as the famous popular woman writer of the time period, George Sand, is also fabulous. As is Mandy Patinkin, who Princess Bride fans will know as the sword-fighting fatalistic spaniard. The comedy is well-timed, well-scripted, and well-carried out, and if you think you'd enjoy watching a film about all that can go wrong (and right) amid a commune of writers and artists, this is a film you want to see as soon as possible!"
5,Charming historical romantic comedy!,"He is Frederic Francois Chopin (Hugh Grant), a shy, polite composer prone to tuberculosis. She is Georges Sand (Judy Davis), a rash, impetuous novelist prone to scandal. Surrounded by the other artistic greats of the day (among them Liszt and Delacroix) the two meet and fall in love, despite the best and worst intentions of everyone around them. If you can find this, watch it!"
1,Worst Hugh Grant film ever...,"Being a Hugh Grant fan, I had great hopes for such a well reviewed movie on Amazon, but boy was I mistaken. I am quite sure Hugh Grant himself must be embarrassed with such a performance.This movie had absolutely no story line or plot, paper-thin acting, horrendous values and was a complete waste of time. I managed to make it through the entire thing with the vain hope that somehow the production might redeem itself in the end, but alas, this was not to be the case.To anyone considering a purchase of this movie, I strongly advise you to think twice so you are not disappointed as we were."
3,Potential Lost,"Set around the 1830's, Impromptu is an interesting story of the bold and witty authoress, George Sands (Judy Davis)and her relationship with Chopin. George is a strong woman with much character, which attracts many lovers. She often dresses up as a man and smokes cigars. She knows what she wants out of life and is not afraid to get it. Hugh Grant plays Chopin, her love interest, his piano pieces stir her soul like nothing else has done in her life. However, Chopin is sickly and wants only to focus on his music, he has no time for the women who throw themselves at him. There are many mini plots between lovers, dueling, and friend's betrayals. The movie has an ensemble of talented stars ( Bernadette Peters, Emma Thompson, Anna Massey) who struggle to make the film excellent, but it remains only fair with much of its potential lost.Despite that, overall Impromptu is an entertaining romp and period piece."
2,Getting Chopin,"The whole movie concerns George Sand trying to get close to and possibly gain the affections of Chopin, who she doesn't even know. The mistress of Franz Liszt gets into the act, presumably because she believes that Chopin is more talented than her present amour, and she would make a better muse for him than Sand.This film does not go into the backgrounds of either Chopin or Sand, which would have been interesting. I came away with no new information. Not something that I would ever watch again."
4,Chopin and George Sand,"A fun and imaginative movie about the relationship between Chopin and George Sand (Aurora Dupin). Not historically accurate but it is a comic romance so who cares? Wonderful performances by all involved. Emma Thompson as the giddy Duchess and Mandy Patinkin as Albert were standouts. The cinematography was worth watching the movie for as the film was made in France on location. The detail that caught my eye was when the three coaches showed up or left the Duchess's estate I could see that Lizt's coach had Hungarian horses, Chopin's coach had Polish horses, and George Sand's coach had French horses. I love horses and that detail made my day. I was so inspired by this movie I have since read two of George Sand's novels and have always loved Chopin's music. BTW the movie is filled with Chopin's music."
3,Chopin meets George Sand,"A movie that does a good job of encapsulating the characters and fashion of Fredrik Chopin's time in 1800's Paris. The dialog is witty and the pace of the movie is quick. Hugh Grant plays Chopin, the Polish piano phenomenon,who is swept of his feet by the femme fatale novelist, George Sand{Judy Davis). The movie is funny, the costumes lush and the music, of course heavenly."
1,Prompt bored!,"I am a classical pianist, and I purchased this item in the hope that it would give me more details of chopin's performances as well as his personal life with sand. But from my point of view, it focuses more on listz than the man itself, so anyway, big dissapointment. Don't buy it."
1,Not readable in Europe !!!,"Like happened with other prodcuts, I had the unpleasant surprise that, in spite of having a last generation DVD recorder able to read PAL, SECAM, and NTSC, I could not display these movies due to incompatibility with the common systems in Europe. And no warning is indicated in the box, nor a reference to its region !Amazon should be so kind to introduce in their catalogue an automatic alarm of warning for European customers when they are ordering products that can only be used in America.Like the majority of European sellers do when an American order is received !"
1,An invalid and a tramp,"(...) I haven't read much about Chopin or Sand, but this movie definitely doesn't inspire me to do so in the near future (or ever for that matter). I normally love Hugh Grant, but he played a strange, sickly character with a bad Polish accent. Sand is a tramp with very poor fashion sense. I mean, my goodness, even if you are going to dress like a man it seems like you could still comb your hair!! She seduces Chopin, a man who appears to be quite a bit younger than her and plagued with health issues. It is repulsive. I enjoyed the performances by Emma Thompson and Bernadette Peters more than those of the lead characters. It is probably not worth wasting your time watching this movie."
1,PRETENTIOUS AND BORING,"What happened here? You have a great cast, admirable production and producer/directors of note. Why was this one such a stinker? Something just didn't work here, as if this film was very impressed with itself so it didn't have to ""work"" at it. Sadly, it fails to deliver on all accounts. I saw it in a theatre and literally couldn't WAIT for it to end."
5,One of my all-time FAVORITE movies!!,"This movie, an embellished account of the romance between George Sand (a strong, independent woman before such a thing was fashionable) and Frederic Chopin (the famous but delicate and sickly composer) is truly witty, charming, wonderful and thoroughly entertaining!! Just look at the cast: Judy Davis (in a role she was born to play), Hugh Grant (before any real notoriety), Mandy Patinkin, Bernadette Peters, Julian Sands and Emma Thompson (magnificent as the silly 'titled tart') - all at their very best! And the score, primarily Chopin and Liszt, is the icing on the cake.I've seen it at least 20 times (to make sure all my friends and family could enjoy it as well) but my enjoyment never fades and the ideas and emotions expressed about art, propriety, love and the masculine/feminine still ring true."
4,surprisingly good,I went into this movie not expecting much but was treated to a funny and reasonably well done movie. the move led me to wanting to learn more about the real people the actors portrayed.
4,"Wonderful, But....","I was interested in this film mainly because of having studied classical piano for years & being enthralled with Chopin's compositions (as George Sands apparently was). But my question is: how true to life were the characterizations of Chopin & Sands in the film? Chopin's character seemed so blah actually, so shallow that I had to wonder where the romanricism expressed in his music came from. On the other hand, I fell in love with George Sands.In any case, the film was wonderfully written, acted, directed, photographed, etc. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I was non-plussed by Chopin's character."
4,"attractive, light-hearted fun",with a soundtrack featuring ChopinI'm enjoying it. The story of George Sand falling in love with Chopin. Judy Davis has fun with the part. Marvelous sets and costumes. Funny too.
3,Miss Silver mystery,"This was my first Miss Silver mystery. I would have to rate this so so. Being a big Miss Marple fan I thought this series would be great since I have read all of the Miss Marple books. Yes, it is similar but doesn't compare to the writing of Agatha Christie. Although the story is interesting it seems to drag and I ended up flipping pages. I will probably try one more of this series before I decide to give up on Miss Silver"
2,Rating by stars may not be fair.,"I am a practician of Process Control and SPC, not a member of academia. I purchased this book hoping that it is easy to read and examples would be applicable to manufacturing processes. In contrary it is full of matrix equations, integrals, and derivatives. Examples are not for a practician. It may be the greatest book for a PhD student, I wouldn't know. But if you are an engineer go with something like Paul W. Murill's "" Fundamentals of Process control Theory""."
5,"Great, even at the outset!","That crystal clear voice that we got to know so well as part of ABBA, is there layered in innocense and sweetness, but with something that we rarely got to see in ABBA, Agnetha's own songwriting. One can definitely hear the maturing of her work from the first ""Agnetha"" album through to ""Elva Kvinnor..."", but each stage of her career has its own charm. The earlier works have a carefree sixties kind of lilt to them and then on the later albums, the music is crafted pop that could stand alongside the best of ABBA. It would be really interesting to hear Agnetha's songwriting nowadays, with all that life has offered her and put her through over the last 20 years.For anyone that is a fan of ABBA, this is a must-buy."
5,Perfect = Agnetha,"Anyone who wants to enjoy in clear and stunniung voice of Agnetha should own this. From serious and romantic love songs to funny and cute, everything is there... It's a collection of songs written and performed from the heart."
1,Poor Value,"$22.95 for a 21-page brochure containing the same information freely available at any on-line beading site is a complete rip-off.This ""book"" is unavailable through amazon.co.uk - having tracked it down on amazon.com and having read the glowing reviews, I was looking forward to learning some new techniques and finding inspiration for some new design ideas: What a disappointment!The design ideas are commonplace and - frankly - tacky.....the information the ""book"" contains is thin - again, nothing new.Save your money - do a web search for bead crochet and find far more useful information free of charge."
4,A bit pricey,"The book was recommended by an Instructor as being the most clearly written. I agree the instructions are clear and easy to follow. But feel some other books are equally as good, and present more material than this one."
4,The best book,"Im not a advid book reader, but i will recomend this book to any one. this is one of the best books i have ever red."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!!! :)","I don't care what anyone else says... this is my most favorite book in all the world! It has everything in it from suspense, lust, horror, and mystery. I first read this book back in middle school about 15 years ago and I've been hooked ever since because I keep coming back to read it again. I just read the book again and I finished the whole thing in 2 days because I couldn't put the book down! It's just that good. This is indeed a very good read."
4,Good way to go for the price,"I have used this rod case for several years and am purchasing another one for my grandson's rod. It provides excellent protection for a rod used under normal circumstances. My first purchase was at a local fishing tackle store and the price was close to $40, so this price on Amazon is a real buy. We will be headed for Gull and June Lakes in the high Sierra next month.I remember the old days when you bought a nice rod and the case came with it. I have a Fenwick fiberglass rod that I purchased approximately 30 years ago and it came with a beautiful, well constructed case that I still use. I guess those days are gone forever."
2,Poor quality,"I purchased the 2"" Flambeau and found that the interior measurement is less than advertised. I contacted Flambeau, prior to purchase, and they indicated that the interior is 1-7/8"". I found it to be closer to 1-3/4"", but certainly not the 2"" stated on the Amazon description. The tube is flimsy and is easily compressed. The tube does telescope, but not smoothly. My fault---you get what you pay for and I should have paid more and received the higher quality product that one needs to protect their valuable fishing rods. There is no cushioning on either end to absorb shocks or prevent breakage. A plus is that the cap screws on and is connected by a 1/8"" leather string."
3,Feeding Your Pet Bird,"A good book but it leaves out diet requirements on Eclectus parrots, This was specifically what I was looking for. I guess I'll need to write it myself."
4,Great singer,Gives the Glory to God... where it belongs. He has a fine voice and knows how to use it! I recommend this.
2,Not for me,"We gave this CD away, not to our liking. Prefer less ""background and choir"" more emphasis on voice, delivery and solo performance."
4,Great introduction to the electric side of Snooks but...,"It is a compilation. I wish they would rerelease the original LPs from Blacktop. Although it misses a lot like any compilations, it still yields fantastic tracks and would make a great introduction for Snooks newbies. Despite some of the the 80's style production the fire of Snooks playing is there. Check out also the amazing early acoustic ""New Orleans Street Singer"" from about 1958."
3,OK....,"My son didn't get much use out of the Learning Town toys. When we first got them we thought maybe he was a little young for them but even as he got older he didn't have much interest in them. Of the 3 sets, he liked the garage the most because he could slide the blocks down the ramp."
4,We love this!,"We love this toy! My daughter was given this for her first Christmas when she was 9 months old. She's now 16 months & its her favorite toy. I love the music and so does my 5 yr old and her little sis. Yes, it tells you that mommy's working in the garden, but daddy is working in the kitchen so I think it all equals out.I am disappointed by the 'teaches 30+ words' part. There are words written on the blocks but it gives you the idea if you rotate the block that word will be spoken. Not true. It says 4 phrases for each of the 3 blocks, but does not say the vocabulary words.I highly recommend this for a first birthday toy. Twelve months and up is the perfect age. Baby learns to stack blocks, cause & effect, fine motor of placing the block into the hole. There is also an on/off switch that gives 2 levels of volume. I don't hear much difference between the two levels but maybe someone else will."
5,I want to be their nanny!,"I recently grabbed this book at the Boston Airport because of its colorful cover. I loved it! Stories from Turkey, Laos, India only made me want to sell my car and use the money to travel to these countries. But I also wanted to know more about their nanny from Guatamala. Why didn't they go to her homeland? Before I make the big decision to sell my car, I just want to know one thing...how is the family after a year back in U.S. Did the kids think it was well worth the experience. I hope so."
4,A great read...,"This book is a great read for anyone WITH children interested in traveling around the world. I *expected* to hear of a trip that included first class flights and top-notch hotels...I *appreciated* David's honesty concerning the way money was handled. I think a lot of people are turned off by the whole ""rich guy taking a trip with nanny along"" mainly from jealousy. We may not all be as wealthy as David, but I did not find him pretentios at all. Great idea to put it in an ""emails sent home"" format. Very unique. Now, if he would only put a clip of the charging hippo video on his web site!"
5,Wonderfully entertaining!,This is certainly not your typical travel book -- thanks heavens! This is a wonderful story of a family with 3 children who incidentally take a year to make a trip around the world! Everyone can recognize their family in the well-written book! I laughed out loud so many times and read portions out loud to my family! Now all of them are reading it as well! The real test: I bought 2 copies to ship to friends! Such wonderful entertainment!
2,This book is like a plane full of kids.,"My kids are grown so this book was a real turnoff. It's like being forced to listen to a guy on a cell phone tell cute stories about his kids while you just want to read your paper in peace. Yes, the kids are adorable which is why Cohen's relatives must have loved these e-mails. I didn't though. I don't know these people and they sure seem shallow and materialistic through and through."
4,A great summer read!,"David Cohen did what I would never have the guts to do--take three kids on a trip around the world. His book describes all the highs and lows with lots of humor, warmth, wit and riveting detail. I'm glad I didn't make the trip myself, but I'm also glad I could read this thoroughly enjoyable account."
3,"The Cohen's idea of One Year Off is hardly ""roughing it"".","A good read but hardly the typical family's reality. Not many off us take a vacation with nanny in-tow, nor do we return to purchase a home in Ross (one of the Bay Area's richest suburbs). I resented Cohen's self-depiction as ""one-of-us"" and felt his adventure inaccessible to anyone outside his socio-economic class.Having said that, it is a good read just to glimpse some of the exotic scenes outside the U.S.Would have liked more follow-up on how they met some of the challenges of traveling with their kids. I found Cohen had a tendancy to ask a question but never gave us the answer (eg he wonders how they will feed their kids on the road --who are picky eaters-- and then neglects to tell us what the kids ended up eating to remain healthy during the trip."
5,Entertaining and humorous,"An excellent easy read. Many nights found me not wanting to turn off the light because I was right between significant adventures. As the parent of a toddler, I couldn't have gotten more of a kick out of their littlest one but it was really the last few pages that were most telling: was it worth it? Were the economic issues (before, during and after) and the forced family closeness and the moments of fear and the sheer scope of the trip all worth it? I was glad for the epilogue, and glad for a glimpse of a road not taken (yet.)"
4,How the Experts Win at Bridge,I have not had the time to get very far in the book. So far it meets my needs. I plan to continue my pursuit to become a better bridge player.
3,Fair Intermediate Level book,"Its a good overview for Intermedaite level players that are somewhat isolated and haven't heard about Bridge innovations of the last 20-30 years.Not a bad book. But if you are familiar with modern bridge, and have read other books, there will not be much new here.All in all its OK, its not a great book by any means.5 Stars? I'm curious what those reviewers would conside a 3 star book."
4,Good all around coverage,"The book covers a variety of topics, and discusses changes to the game over the last 25 years (as of the publication date).Its not going to teach you all that much. Instead it will make you aware of things you may not have known about, and you will then need to get some books to adress those subjects.Its good, but not great. No way is it a 5 star book."
5,Unparalleled,"The title of the Book made one wonder if there is really something common among experts. Being no expert myself, I was curious, too, to find that out. This book illustrates the fine points separating good players from experts in all aspects of the game. When I was reading the book, many deals started flowing through my mind and I realized that had I read this book earlier, I could have easily impromved my results. This book is highly recommended to all those players who want to take that final step to being called ""expert""."
5,The Best Name Book Ever,"I was so excited to discover this book. Pamela Redmond Satran and Linda Rosenkrantz are -- hands down -- the very best baby namers in the business and I have always found their advice to be extremely useful. Their previous books (including Beyond Jennifer and Jason & The Last Word on First Names) were far and away my favorite books when I was naming my first 3 children. Pamela and Linda are always funny and hip and all of their books make fine pregnancy reading. This newest book, though, is a real treasure. Not only is it a beautiful keepsake gift for us to be able to pass down to our next baby, but it created some special time for my husband and I to reflect on our family histories and what's really important to us and our future. It is a great book and one I will be giving to all the pregnant women I know and love."
3,What Happened?,"The first album I ever got by these guys was the self title and....this is not like the self title. They've almost abandoned the ska little ska sound they used to have. Reall depressing if you're into that about them. That's not to say I don't recommend buying their other stuff. I dig the ""self title"" and a few songs from ""stomping ground"" and ""open your eyes"" as well. Overall, this cd blows and is a complete let down."
1,Oh dear.,"I don't understand all these people that are saying this change is good - fair enough, they have changed their music, but now they sound like busted (and thats a bad thing by the way!)I am the BIGGEST fan of Goldfinger and have been obsessed with everything they have even done - I even thought open your eyes was a good album just because it was from my favourite band.But NOT this album, this is embarrassing, the people who say that this is good obviously don't like Goldfinger for their uniqueness and comic outlook. It is a money-making album with no time put into it - it was recorded quickly and badly. All the songs sound too similar, no catchy riffs - no happy ska sound.True Goldfinger fans won't like this! Silly people who think it's great. Fair enough if you like it - but you can't say fans shouldn't be bothered by this awful change!"
1,5 stared idiots,"For all those idiots telling us we're idiots because we can't except change and all that bull crap, please listen to our opinions!Now first: The whole point of ska punk/ska is the fact that it is different, that is what made goldfinger different back in the day! Now they sound like all the other gay poppy/punk bands today like:new found glory (Horrible) simple plan (horrible) the starting line (awful) good charlette (the worst)These bands are in their own catigory of the worst music put on the radio today (excluding country) Now the sad thing is that Goldfinger has now joined these horrible bands as the worst bands to ever put out a CD!!!So I believe we're the ones that can except change in music, that is the whole point of listening to SKA, but it is sad to see you are the idiots who don't realize you are changing! So go ahead and buy this CD make another band rich so they can abanden the fans that got them popular in the first place!!![...]"
1,At one time Goldfinger had core values.,"Do you remember when Goldfinger wasn't a preaching vegan band? Or when John would encourage fans not to support Nike and their adventures? Not only has the music lyrically and musically gone down hill, but now they even thank Nike in the liner notes. If you are looking for anything punk, even really poppy punk, this isn't the cd you want."
3,"Not as good, but still good","I don't know what everyone is whining about. This album is good! Certainly not as good as some of their previous stuff, especially Stomping Ground and Open Your Eyes, but I still enjoy it quite a bit. I am a little turned off by the vegan ""preaching"" but so what? I still like the music, and they were doing the same thing on Open Your Eyes. (That's what the title track was about!) In the end, it is a good, fun CD. I'm glad I bought it, and would recommend it to any true Goldfinger fan."
2,Disconnected,"Goldfinger...This review isn't about previous releases, how long I've liked Goldfinger, or how great they are live. This review is about this album. This pollished, over-produced, uncatchy, and overall pathetic attempt for an album. The lyrics are weak and whiny, always complaining about being lost, ""wasted"", or tired. The sound is boring and dull and nothing stands out or makes you want to listen to it again. I tried hard to like it, I forced myself to listen and try, thinking about earlier albums and maybe I'm missing the edge. It's unbearable and I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone. If you're just getting into Goldfinger, pick up their self-titled or ""Hang Ups"". Please do not judge this otherwise incredible band on this album alone."
5,Party Time - Brazilian Style!,"Awesome collection of songs. I was wary that it may be too electronic or fusional... but not so! There are blazing instrumental parts and absolutely incredible, powerful and full-of-life vocals that will really make you want to dance! You will hardly even notice the electronic elements, as they only enhance all the live action. A great driving, party, or chore-doing CD. Seriously consider getting it! Lots of tracks, too!"
4,Salomé De Bahia - Brasil,"Why go to Brazil when you can bring BRASIL to you? Salomé De Bahia's second album is another tropicalia explosion. It's carnivale in just under an hour. There's plenty of finger-snapping moments on the immensely catchy ""Pais Tropical"" and the chorus on ""Festa Para Um Rei Negro"" will almost have you singing along. The famous ""Mas Que Nada"" gets a nice downtempo rub here, and the stripped-down (by comparison) ""Brigette Bardot"" lingers long after the the horns have quieted. A bit of cheeky charm creeps into ""Mambo Bacan,"" and Michel Fugain lends his mellifluous voice to ""Voce Abusou"" as a counterpoint to de Bahia's powerhouse performances. But, in my eyes, the reclaiming of Barry Manilow's ""Copacabana"" is the album's high point. If Manilow was only toying with tropicalia, then Salome de Bahia serves it hot, fruit hat and all."
5,The cost of war,"If you truly want to know how war has affected veterans of all generations, this is the documentary you should watch.Thanks for your service, your sacrifices, and for sharing your stories.God bless all veterans."
5,Encouraging to our service members. Very well made documentary.,This documentary gives a wonderful message of hope to our service membersand their families who are affected by PTSD.
4,I love Wayne Dyer.,"I have always loved Wayne Dyer but I resonate with him more now since his teachings gone down a more spiritual path. My favorite book of his is ""Excuses Be Gone"" and this book is a good compliment to that one."
3,fair,"The directions for learning the method of meditation recommended in this book is short and concise and it is useful, HOWEVER, the CD that was supposed to be included was not in the book. It had been torn out which was obvious from the torn CD packet."
3,Okay,"I have been a fan of Dr. Dyer for nearly 20 years and I know that I have everything he's written. Every book/CD was very special and unique ---with great positive energy. However, I didn't find this one any different than Meditations for Manifesting: Morning and Evening Meditations to Literally Create Your Heart's Desire. But, if you don't already have Meditations for Manifesting..., I'd recommend Getting in the Gap..."
4,This is a nice meditation,"I love Dr. Wayne Dyer's work. He is so helpful and full of insite. I love this meditation book, and have found it very helpful. I love the book and CD combo. My only complaint, and it's not really a complaint, is that, at first, his meditation, was to me, a bit disruptive. When you try to meditate with him, it took me a time or too to get completely comfortable with his voice and allow it to be relaxing to me as well, but it wasn't that big of deal, just different.I almost gave this five stars, and maybe it deserves that instead of the four I attributed to it, because I have found it a very helpful meditation (especially because I've never meditated before - it's great for beginners)."
3,Dr. Dyer on Meditation,"I usually love Dr. Dyer's books but this one was 1/3 his theory on meditation, 1/3 commercial for his books, and 1/3 the dialog of the CD contents. The third on meditation wasn't too bad for Christian people(he utilizes the first 10 words of The Lord's Prayer) who have never meditated before and are looking at possibly testing the water. Small book, fast read and sleep inducing guided meditation CD. Overall a little lacking compared to other books by this author."
5,best meditation cd around,This is the best method for learning meditation that I have ever seen. It is quick and very effective. I recommend it to everyone that I know.
2,Where is the CD that was promised with this book?,"I recieved this book in the mail today. I am pleased with the book and quickly read it. What I am disappointed with is there was not a meditation CD in the book, which is the reason why I purchased the book in the first place. I think the seller should stop advertising the book as being sold with CD if there is no CD. False advertising."
1,Boring mediation on the maleness and Fatherhood of God.,"I looked forward to learning more about Japa meditation as I practice several different types and had heard Dyer mention it in another book. What I wasn't prepared for at all was the heavy God the Father, Christianized focus of the CD. I don't see myself as a child of some male parent in the sky. The word ""father"" is not one of comfort for me and does not speak of co-creation, it speaks of the dominiation and exclusion I felt in my experiences with Patriarical religion. Dyer would have been better off not giving an omnipotent being a sex or suggesting a traditional ""human"" role for him.If the focus wasn't bad enough, his reading was just plain boring. I can read the lord's prayer on my own. I have a problem with people who sell CD's created from material which is in the public domain. Why pay for it???"
1,incomplete,"This is my second review, I received the book without the CD. This type of situation enhance my pessimism for online shopping.Disappointed"
1,book with no CD,"The book was in great condition but no CD. I tried to contact them but with no luck, they have no contact information. I got what I paid for. Next time I'll buy a book I'll go to the bookstore high price but probably the same as the shiping and handling, at least I know I'll leave the store with a complete book in my hand."
3,Close-minded terminology ruined the book for me,"You would think that someone like Wayne Dyer, who has made millions upon millions of dollars off of primarily women, would find a way to refer to deity that does not aggrandize his own sex (male), but no. A short disclaimer along the lines of ""You can think of God any way you want, but in this book I'm referring to Him as a MALE"" is a slap in the face to his female listeners. I've listened to Wayne Dyer for decades. I was able to understand when all of his earlier works were self-aggrandizing; after all, he was insecure, but he still said helpful things. But I cannot understand his insistence on referring to God as a male, or even in an anthropomorphic sense at all. Surely he is creative enough to come up with something more accurate. I'll never buy his work again. Wayne, your audience is outgrowing you."
3,Not the best,"I found this guided meditation somewhat unpleasing. While engaged in the ""Ah"" sound, Dyer's voice is rather abrasive. I found his pitch distracting and annoying. I only listened to it 3 times before searching for an alternative."
3,worth it for the CD,"I think this offering was a bit contrived. It appeared to be a rehashing of rehashed thoughts and ideas packaged as a delivery system for what I feel is an extremely helpful CD on meditation. Wayne Dyer is someone I feel is a reasonably enlightened individual and I would never qualify one of his contributions. That said, I thought this item may have been a bit too slickly packaged, and obviously designed to be commercially appealing.The enclosed CD is worth the purchase price, but I don't understand the need for a verbatim translation taking up space in a booklet that did no more than use up too many trees."
4,Japa explained very nicely,"I had a bit of a problem with this book and accompanying CD. I just can't seem to ""get in the gap"" as Wayne instructs. I've only had this CD and book for a few months, so I am practicing as Wayne encourages. It is so hard to still the mind to make a conscious connection with God. But I don't think it is anything that Wayne is doing wrong, I believe it is me."
1,I laughed for all the wrong reasons,"As a teacher of meditation both in public and private institutions for over a decade, it was with some interest that I picked up this book. It gave me some of the best laughs I've had in a long time but unfortunately for all the wrong reasons. If anyone reading this comes away thinking that the book is about genuine meditation then they've unfortunately been duped. It is full of new age psycho babble and techniques that have very little to do with the heart of real meditation, but little else. I'd advise anyone interested in meditation to look at the books here on Amazon by authors such as John Daishin Buksbazen, Sharon Salzburg and Jessica Macbeth, which are the real deal."
4,Getting in the gap review,Got the book in a timely manner and it was in good condition. I'd do business with this vendor again.
5,I like it!`,"I have been meditating for years, and have even gotten to the point of healing myself, leaving the past behind, living in the moment, etc. I am working on my Dyer library, and am sharing it with my family. I came to a point in my life where meditation didn't work anymore, and upon receipt of this CD, I am able, again, to meditate.Everything happens for a reason, and sometimes, as we grow spiritually, what used to work, doesn't anymore. This CD pulled me back into meditation, and since the first time I have used it, my life is smoother, love is easier to give, and my ego is fighting me like crazy.Blessings to everyone who tries it and finds it a help, and those who don't, and to Dr. Dyer for sharing this valuable information."
5,Powerful Book that can help you progress with meditation,"Dr. Dyer is a powerful writer and speaker. This book and Cd help you meditate, or find the silence in the gap between thoughts. He teaches you how to do it and also puts it in the context of of experiencing god. His words and voice resonate with warmth and generousity and this book/cd is worth every penny. I also recommend his ""10 Secrets"" book highly (as well as most everything else he writes). Another book that is exceptional at helping you become well, to experience deep wellness, is ""Effortless Wellbeing: The Missing Ingredients for Authentic Wellness"" by Evan Finer. Highly recommend these titles!"
5,Essential Tools for Happiness,"Getting in the Gap made me feel centered, peaceful, grounded and overall simply happy. It is a tool that is necessary for a balanced life. Dyer is a very thorough teacher. He has mastered ideas so exquisitly and he has displayed them here for us so that we may become better people. His book is truly a gift to us people who lived a chaotic, scattered life before. Like any goal in life, however, being at peace with yourself needs to be worked on. Getting in the Gap is a great place to start. There are other books and CD's that should accompany your quest. Sacred Contracts by Ruiz, Lucky Monkeys In The Sky by Michele Geraldi, and the Five people you meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom, are helpful tools as well. Even then, you will just be getting started on your quest, but it will ultimately be the most rewarding quest of your life."
4,great and easy to follow,This was a great and easy to follow meditaton guide. It really can bring the calm back to our busy lives.
4,"Okay, good, but I thought the other mediatation CDs were better","I love most of Dr. Dyer's books and audios. This one is good, but it's not my favorite. I feel that some types of meditation works better for some than for others, and maybe this one didn't work as well for me. The book is a thin volume with a meditation CD, and the price is really affordable, so I think it's worth a try if you are curious. You don't have much to lose. But I still feel that the guided Meditations for Manifesting is better.[...]."
3,It doesn't last,"The smell is gone 15 minutes after spraying, I have purchased this item before and never had trouble with it until now"
1,"FAKE, this is totaly fake!","This 'amazon' Body Kouros is totaly FAKE! After 15 minutes,his smell is off! I have original Body Kouros YSL, his smell is working two days on my skin! Very very bad business of 'amazon'! I want my money back!"
2,it doesn't matter,"I read Milne's Red House Mystery and liked it well enough that I looked for more mysteries that he had written. I hoped that this title was a quote from one of the characters, but it's a collection of articles written for a periodical. I agreed with his assessment--they really don't matter!"
2,Not for cancer recovery,"This book was a huge disappointment to someone trying to take care of a cancer patient. It is, in essence, a re-hash of the familiar food pyramid guidelines that advise low-fat, low-protein and high-carbohydrate diets, organized around specific cancers. The scientific basis, if there is one, relates to epidemiologic studies of cancer risk. It might be helpful to someone who is trying to reduce their risk of various cancers by altering their dietary habits, but I doubt if this book has much more to offer than most of what has been published on that topic over the past several years. It has no scientific grounding for those who already have cancer, and may in fact suggest dietary patterns that would undermine the nutritional needs of those who are already in treatment, when fats and proteins may be friends. For someone undergoing cancer treatment, or in recovery from that ordeal, it has very little to offer that the hand-outs in your doctor's office don't already tell you."
2,"Doesn't live up to the promise of ""Broken Wing""","""Broken Wing"" is the song that first turned me onto Martina McBride--it's powerful and moving, as are her songs I love on previous albums. Unfortunately, the rest of this album doesn't live up to that promise. ""Wrong Again"" has grown on me, and a couple of the other songs are pretty, but ""Happy Girl"" just annoys me (like that way too perky co-worker way too early in the morning), and most of the album is completely forgettable. Maybe it's just because I grew up on the rock side of the tracks, but Evolution strikes me as rather anemic . . . she'd be better off avoiding the unoriginal and mild-mannered tracks here and concentrating on songs like ""Broken Wing"" and ""Wild Angels"" that allow her fabulous voice to do its thing."
3,BROKEN WINGS,"the reason i was reviewing this cd, was because i was looking to find out who sang a song i liked. i did'nt know who sang the song or the title, so i searched on my own of whom i thought it could be. martina mc bride has a song named valentine, but i don't know if it is the correct one. i can't hear it before i buy it. i would like to be able to hear it before i buy it"
4,I love her voice!,Martina has an incredible voice and I love the songs on here. If she had written at least one I'd have given her 5 stars.
5,Great music from one of the top singers of the past 30 year,"Each song is exceptional. Martina puts her heart and soul in ever song. This is also apparent when she sings on award shows etc. Her songs are as refreshing as she is. When she sings you take notice and listen, appreciate your good fortune that she made it in this tough industry."
5,Absolutely incredible--one of my all-time favorite CDs,"Martina is definitely first-rate. Her voice is incredibly powerful and so beautiful. I haven't been buying too many CD's lately; it seems there's only a few good songs on most CDs I buy--not so with this one! Every one is a winner! I don't skip any (I must confess, though, I do hit the repeat button a couple times on Broken Wing). I plan to start a Martina McBride CD collection now!"
5,Terrific!,"Martina is an excellent performer and one of my absolute favorites. Her song ""Happy Girl"" is my personal favorite. I love all her songs."
3,Could be better.,"This cd has EXCELLENT SONGS like ""Broken Wing"", ""Be That Way"", ""Whatever You Say"", ""Valentine. BUT there are other songs that are boring, like ""One Day You Will"" and 'I don't Wanna See You Again"", but is a good country album, Martina has an awesome voice."
5,A Great Martina McBride Album,"This is a great female empowerment album and, like Shania Twain's Up album, it's not just for females. It makes me proud to be a female. She sings about refusing to stay silent just because you are a female, meeting a guy and thinking that he'd be great only to see that he sucks...just like the last one, being a happy girl, keeping your distance from a guy that you love but who doesn't love you as much as you do, still holding on in spite of the tough times that you've had, not wanting to see someone again, etc. Everything is great. If I remember correctly, the only song I don't have on my ipod is called Broken Wings because it is sounds so depressing to me. It's not that the lyrics are bad 'cause they're not. Specifically, it's about a woman who breaks free from an abusive man, which is terrific. I'm just not a huge country fan, but definitely get this album and I think you'll be glad that you did."
5,Goes straight to the heart,"Every single song on here is something that everyone is gonna relate to at sometime in their life wether your female or male. Martina has a powerful voice wich carries each message of the songs right to your heart and soul. I'm a sixteen year old girl and these songs help me get through life with a smile and a little bounce in my step. Martina is a very talented woman and it shows in every thing she does. This album is great, it's always in my CD player. I definately reccomend this to everyone. I LOVE IT!!!!"
5,combination of angelic voice and superb music,"This album was the first conutry album I had ever listened to. Since, I am a big fan. This album is truly rEVOLUTIONary. The music is a perfect combination of country/pop/blues. Martina's voice is angelic. I listened to it for 12 hours on a long flight, straight and uninterrupted! My favorite track is ""some say I'm running."" My least favorite is the duet with Clint Black. Great album! Kevin."
5,MARTINA MCBRIDE CAN SING!!!!!,"Martina has the best voice that my ears have ever heard! I use to think Leann Rimes had the best voice until listening to this album. She really goes all out in this album. My favorites are ""What Ever You Say"" and ""Be That Way"". This album has songs that relate to all kinds of different things. I think this album have songs that people can relate to and understand. With each album she keeps getting better and better! Which is why I can't wait for the next album of hers to come out. After this one, it will be very hard to beat!"
2,"Eh, not so good.......","First off, the .20 bullets sink a TON. I doubt this actually shoots 300 fps, more like in the 200's. It has pretty bad range and a small clip size (I recommend getting a speed loader, makes loading a lot faster and easier.)The gun has pretty high velocity for the range, very light and looks AWSOME with the silencer (which by the way doesn't silence anything, it's just for looks.) Overall, I would not recommend this gun. You would be better with a spring shotgun/sniper or spending spending a little more money on a better AEG."
4,A comment on another comment,"On July 12, a reader from ""somewhere"" expressed distain for 1984, partly on the basis that Orwell's plot was lifted from Yevgeny Zamyatin's novel ""We."" Seems unlikely. 1984 was published in 1949, while the first printing of ""We"" was in Russian, in 1952! Orwell was the firstest with the mostest, in my opinion."
5,Jazz Trumpeter scores again!,"What a marvel to put four of the hottest young jazz singer together. Since 1990 Terence Blanchard has put out an album every year with everyone tackling a different theme. Here he tackles the music of the great American composer Jimmy McHugh for a sucessful blend of wonderful music with modern touch. Highly recommended. Tracks to check out: ""Sunny Side of the Street"" with Cassandra Wilson and Jane Monheit's ""Can't give you anything but love""."
4,"After all, jazz is the CREATIVE popular music...","...not the trendy or the traditional. Especially with Blanchard and Jane Monheit's rendering of ""I Can't Give You Anything But Love"". It may be respectful to follow the obvious template when doing another composer's music (as witness Brian Setzer's dead-on treatment of Prima's ""Jump Jive an' Wail"") but not when you're doing a whole album of that same composer. So Blanchard and Monheit make it impossible to listen to that old McHugh standard with half an ear when they switch it from quasi-Dixieland swing to a groove-oriented piece a la Brubeck, Zawinul or (even though we know him more by his voice) Connick Jr. The instrument that defines this pattern, of course, is the piano, but that's nothing new--Blanchard has always been great at writing and arranging for instruments not his own. This number reminds us that funk didn't get its start with electronics."
5,This is what Jazz is about!,"What more can I say about this superb album that hasn't been said already but I'll give it a try. This is truly American Jazz music at it's finest, it isn't a ground breaking album but it's one lovers of jazz music MUST have in their collection, if it doesn't win any grammy's then there isn't any justice. As for the vocalists, I'd replace only one of them with Ms Carmen Lundy (check out her new album 'This is Carmen Lundy'). Mr Blanchards playing has a warmth and vitality, which manages to give something extra to the music, laid back in parts but with a nice kick, definately not background music. Despite the appearance of four very different vocalists, it remains HIS album throughout, listen to his playing on ' You're a sweetheart', superb (Miles must be smiling). Perhaps, I am being overly enthusiastic in calling it a Masterpiece but that's what it is and Jimmy McHugh must have a tear in his eye, when listening to it beyond the pearly gates!"
3,Summary of old press releases,"Basically a compendium of information that appears to be derived from press releases. A bit weak on technical details. Not much about industry personalities. Strong on home consoles, weak on the games themselves. Very limited coverage of computer and coin arcade videogames. But it does provide a useful chronology of the home videogame industry."
4,Good book about console games history.,"This book explain the console game's history, but lacks in arcade sections, and contains no informations at all about Amiga, C64, and other computer devoted to games. Also, the narration is very unpersonal, and fails in fascinating the computer games addicted. Anyway, i recommend that to anyone who want to know the console's history, from Atari 2600 to Sony Playstation."
2,A dry history of video games,"I purchased this book for my thesis (about cost structures of the video game console industry) and did find quite a bit of useful information in terms of what systems were produced when, historical prices, etc. However it was not a very entertaining read. Also, the organizationm of the book, which is broken down by year, makes it hard to follow events that lasted multiple years. (lawsuits, product development cycles, etc.) It's a decent book if you're doing research, or if you're a hard core video game history fanatic, but otherwise I wouldn't reccomend it. A much better book is David Sheff's Game Over, although that only focuses on Nintendo."
3,"Good history, if biased","Phoenix succeeds in being an excellent reference book covering practically every video game console ever in existence and some that never made it that far. Dry, but informative.Unfortunately, the later parts of the book are really tough to read and the writer falls into biases. Rarely is Nintendo mentioned without a remark attacking it."
2,Only for the die-hard.,"This is more of a history of the video game industry than a history of video games. It's worth reading to find out about the origins of Atari, and about obscure, failed systems of the early days...the last half, on the Playstation era, isn't as interesting.The style is pretty dry and impersonal. In the next edition I'd like to see more cultural history, and more on the evolution of the design of the games themselves. I want to know more about the programmers, and how they came up with games like Food Fight.As it is, all you find out about Tetris, for example, is ""you stop blocks from piling up."" But congrats to Herman for putting this vast amount of information together."
5,The Great One,What an amazing story The Great One has. From his days as a young boy through the end of his career with the New York Rangers. This DVD has it all. Perfect for anyone who loves hockey or great athletes.
3,"Anatoly , St.Petersburg , RUSSIA","Interesting enough disk, quite good replenishment of a collection of disks about best of the best hockey players of all times."
1,Not useful,"it has a poor design that makes this belt unusable.The belt is not a straight from one to the other end, I mean it has that very inconvenient breaks here and there with unnecessary attachments, stretchable fabrics, in very obstructive locations imaginable. I kept it for weeks in case it might be useful in some ways, and then went into trash bin."
2,Good ....But Not An Effort That Will Stand The Test Of Time,"Alan Jackson seems like he is just going through the motions. This album is pleasant but there is nothing here that will be remembered after the dust settles. Die hard fans will like it but not those who are only ""casual"" fans. ""I'll Go On Loving You"" is a catchy toon but far from what I would consider country music. As one reveiwer put it ""solid but unremarkable""...I agree and expect more from this Artist. I would say recent releases by Patty Loveless and Vince Gill are a much better choice!"
4,Love Alan Jackson,"This was a replacement for the disc I broke several years ago. The words to ""The Little Man"" really tell the story of America."
2,up... then down.. then up... then down,"This CD is definately not his best work. I loved his old stuff, but this album is only good every few songs. Some of the cuts seem like the ""we need a few more songs to finish this CD, good or not"". Little Man, Gone Crazy, these are great songs. However, if I hear ""I'll Go On Loving You"" one more time, I am going to go on shooting myself in the foot."
5,I have been putting High Mileage on this CD!,This CD is as entertaining as country music gets. Alan Jackson once again establishes himself among the elite of country music singers. Thank goodness we don't have to worry about him going pop. Buy this CD and you won't be disappointed.
5,A Great CD,Alan just keeps getting better and better. I Will Go On Loving You is one of his best songs ever. If you Like Alan Jackson you will love this CD.
4,Short but Sweet,"While this is a good CD, you don't get much bang for your buck as the total play time is less than 40 minutes. However, what is there is good and is worth a listen."
2,Don't BORE the Jukebox!!,"This cd starts off good!! Two GREAT songs that are now hit singles and the rest is slow, slower and is the slowest hes done. Sorry Alan! Buy his greatest hits cd instead. Or if you don't have it buy his' cd, ""Don't Rock The Jukebox"" Its his best cd yet!!"
5,"Straight laced ""Country"" - sung with utter sincerity.","High Mileage provides a nice variety of lighthearted up-tempo tunes (Right on the Money) and seriously emotional ballads (Gone Crazy and I'll Go On Loving You). The beauty of this CD is that no matter what track is playing - the same pure, emotional passion of Alan's voice shines through. His love of traditional ""no frills"" country music is, perhaps, best reflected in the songs that he's written himself.What other Country artist can boast a self-penned signature song as popular as Chattahoochee?Traditional country music, typically, represents ""true life"" experiences. . . Alan Jackson relives his experiences in song - with all the passion his heart can hold!"
5,One of the best CD's I've bought all year!,"I alway's liked Alan Jackson before, but after listening to this CD..It stands out as his best yet. The songs he sings pulls at your heart strings, as well as every emotion in you. Don't miss purchasing this this one while enjoying one of country's greatest entertainers."
5,"Poetic, great real singing, country style",Alan sings!!!!!!none of this repitition of five notes and five words stuff. Listen to the meanings of the songs - especially those he has written. His songs aren't just for listening: they're for singing.
5,A Creative collection of Heartfelt songs i.e. Country Living,"Alan has pulled himself together and shown us his best side with this compilation of heartwarming songs. This man could read us the phone book and we would love it, but he just has such a wonderful voice and delivery as he uniquely gives of himself again. He has written 5 of these new songs and the titles alone could be juxtaposed into some type of country paragraph. I mean the man Is Country. Life experiences are always the basis of a great country song and this album is full of them so the common man/woman can really relate to Alan and his recent experiences as keeping him as part of the masses. I feel he has delivered a great album and that its few acoustical features definitely add to its warm charm. He knows how to pull a great selection of songs together and keep us replaying them in order to find a favorite title and the enhancement of favorite video clips is an outstanding bonus."
4,"This is a good CD, but......","This CD is not the right gift to give to a close friend if you are a married male and the close friend is a woman. Your wife will kick your ass. There is a lot of words on this CD. Words guys do not hear till your pissed off wife points them out to you. The one song missing on the cd is ""Sleeping in the doghouse"" but that can be on his next CD."
5,his best yet,If you like country music from the heart this is the one. The baritone voice is A-one and the words of every cut of the album touch me in some way. Alot of been there-done that. This will be my most often played for long time.
4,What's not to love?,These were great stocking stuffers and are still used for dress up all the time. They won't stay 'closed' which sometimes frustrates the kids - but they love wearing them around and being silly!!
5,A Must for Your Coffee Table!,"If you are of Irish descent (and are proud of it) and live in America, you should own and proudly dislay a copy of this book. It is a beautiful pictoral presentation of how the Irish immigrated, integrated, and adjusted to life in this country.By a quirk of fate I can be found in the two page picture of the Murphy family reunion of 1988 on pages 188 and 189.W.A. Murphy -- 10/07/00"
4,Click!,"Cam Jansen has a incredible memory. One day Cam and her friend Eric Shelten thought they saw a U.F.O. Cam's real name is Jennifer. But when people discovered her memory, they started to call her Camera. But soon they shortened Camera and started to call her Cam. Whenever Cam tries to remember something, she always says click. I like the Cam Jansen books a lot."
5,Deep Wrinkle treatment rocks,This is a great product. I've used it daily for 3 weeks. It absorbs quickly and has improved the texture and color of my normally ruddy reddish skin. Wrinkles are fading quickly and expect it to keep improving. It's infused with concentrated Retinol plus Hyaluronic Acid that works. I don't need to look further.
5,I call it my miracle cream!,"I cant say enough about this product. I've been using it for about a month and even friends and family are noticing a difference in my skin. It leaves my skin baby smooth, has reduced the appearance of wrinkles and has evened out the tone of my skin. A side note worth mentioning ... If I had a little extra on my fingers after moisturizing my face I would rub it into my hands and I also began to see a noticeable difference in my hands and nails. My nails were always breaking and chipping ... not any more! I love this stuff !"
3,gift,i gave them as a gift to a friend at work who like to try new things she said it was ok but they were a little stale and low flavor. i do not eat popcorn so i didn't taste them
4,If you don't know by now...,"One of the best recent anime series allowed in prime time. Concludes the Chunin exams story arc (except for the first episode or two of the next set). Only down side is that these sets are only 3 disc half-seasons rather than full seasons, especially considering the price. That's the only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5."
4,Why so much?,"I have all the box sets so far (30.00) and the last one was the cheapest. Now I know that anime sometimes tends to drag on, and that is what the hokage and orochimaru does.But this one is like 37.00. I It only has 12 episodes tat is not officially half a season it usualy takes two box sets of 13 for that.I know I am stingy but really.I think they only have so many episodes because they have to have the japanese version to."
4,"Good movie to watch, not serious and good for laughs",this is one of the funnier movies from Ashton Kutcher. the beginning is very James Bond like and then becomes a standard chase movie.There is a good twist at the end that ties everything together. the one downside is that almost everyone is a killer at the end and it repeats itself.
1,Terrible,"I'm a huge fan of Katherine Heigl and watched this to see her. I was so disappointed! This movie is so bad that it could literally ruin a good actors career. I like movies that start out good, and this one does that, but it goes downhill so fast after the first 20 minutes that it's barely watchable. I almost quit a few times but wanted to see what happened when she found out that she married a killer. It was ridiculous how quickly she took it all in stride, even though at first she acted like she was going to leave him. Tom Selleck and Catherine O'Hara are MUCH too good for this flop, too. Don't waste your time.And, all those people who are supposedly ""trained killers""? They certainly are terrible shots! When the lead characters are running out in the wide open with machine guns blasting away at them, they don't even get touched. and yet she hits people with one shot even though she's never shot a gun before? Just plain stupid."
3,Killers from Canada?,"Maybe I didn't read closely enough but when I went to watch it last night, it was a Canadian Blu-ray. It still worked fine, but the quality was a little less than I was hoping for."
2,Twist at the end saved it from one star,"I was not expecting very much from this movie. And I did not get very much! I don't think I laughed one time. For some reason, the supposedly funny scenes appear to be strained. The twist at the end was interesting though."
2,didn't hit the mark,"Unusually poor acting by Kutcher, his counterpart plays her typical sort of role. The humor falls short, the action is predicatable and over-the-top. I would compare this to a poor mans version of Mr and Mrs Smith or Knight and Day."
2,Very boring.... and I like Heigl,"I liked Katherine Heigl a lot. She's easy on the eyes and yet acts like she's attainable by any Joe Shmoe. (Knocked Up) This film, though it has an interesting premise, is super-boring. Not even Heigl's personality can raise it above it's snooze-fest status. And she makes an awful team with Ashton Kutcher. He needs to stick with side roles a la That 70s Show, cause he's certainly not leading man worthy.The one positive attribute to the movie are some of the scenic shots of Europe. It made me want to go on vacation."
2,It was a great struggle to make it through this movie,"Just like my title says, my girlfriend and I struggled to make it through this movie. About halfway through, I turned to her and said, ""you wanna watch something else, or you want to just see how it ends?"" and we agreed to watch it until the end. When we did, I can say with assurity, that this was a terrible movie, with very few bright spots. Not much else to say besides that! That about sums it all up!"
2,A Waste,"Killers has two attractive stars, both with good comedic talent, but they're let down by a lame plot and an anticlamctic ending. What was supposed to be a plot twist ends up just muddying up the story and sapping all the energy out of the ending. Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher have decent chemistry, and there are flashes of it everywhere. But the scene when they finally begin working together (done effectively in Mr and Mrs Smith) lasts only about a minute here. In a lightweight fluff film like this, the predictable ending would have probably been better. As it is, seems a waste of all that star power. Skip this one."
3,Funny,"A lighthearted and funny action film that movies quickly, and has a few surprising scenes. Makes for some enjoyable entertainment."
3,Much better that I expected.,"Starts off well and the stars are surprisingly good together (I'm not especially a fan of either). Katherine Heigl is particularly good and I liked the development of her character who did not remain clueless and hopeless throughout the film but displayed intelligence and adapted to her ""fish out of water"" ""in over her head"" situation with relative aplomb after the requisite (and not entirely inapropriate) freaking out. The movie's potential was undermined though by a complete failure to wrap up the story at the end."
3,Not great but an ok watch if you don't have high expectations,"Ok I admit it: I like Ashton Kutcher although he has been in a few duds. He plays Spencer, a retired hit man, well a hit man who decided to walk away from it when he met Jen, played by Katherine Heigl, in France.Three years later they are married and living a normal suburban life when Spencer gets a note from his old boss requesting a meeting. Suddenly he finds himself a target of his neighbors, buddies, and coworkers, and does not know who he can trust. I found Heigl, who I didn't know, excellent in this but really didn't care for Jen's parents, played by Tom Selleck and Catherine O'Hara. I found their characters stilted and boring and not genuine.The movie is entertaining but there are many bad lines and the ending is not believable at all, kind of a dud of an ending in my opinion. Don't pay for it but if it's free and you have nothing better to do, it's not a complete waste of time."
4,"Light hearted, funny, and nothing too serious","Sometimes I like to relax and watch a movie that really doesn't require any thinking. This movie fits the bill. Yes, it is totally unrealistic but that is kind of the point. You definitely would not want a small child to watch this or anyone that has problems with knowing where reality ends and fantasy begins. It is a nice romantic, but not too mushy for the guys, comedy with a little spy action thriller thrown in and a little bit of a mystery."
5,Very cute!!!,"I am a huge Katherine Heigl fan, but didn't think much of Aston Kutcher... until I saw this movie. Talk about eye candy! Anyways. I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun, cute and entertaining. Was it the best romantic comedy ever? No. Was it super original? No, but it was well done and seemed fresh. I definitely recommend this movie."
1,How to NOT watch this film = do anything else.,"It occurred to my astute friend as we sat before the first 10 minutes of ""Killers"", that Ashton Kutcher is indeed a failed experiment subject created by the government to envelope Kermit the Frog in human skin. As he flopped on set and clumsily murmured his lines to a Miss Piggy impersonator (katherine heigl), it became quite apparent his stuffing may burst through any moment to reveal a more deserving (though admittedly inanimate) actor . Instead a flimsy bag of flesh stumbles at the feet of this ""action/romantic/comedy/advertisement/ movie"", and pitifully begs us to endure the malignant side effects of watching Ashton and Katherine pretend to act like they are actors. The only redeeming moments are manifested by Catherine O'Hara who seems to be acting like an alcoholic, though in fact merely became one while enduring the making of this film."
3,"slow start, slightly better as it moves on","I rented this based on the description, haven't seen the trailer. The movie starts *very* slowly - almost no action for the first 30 min. It's getting slightly better after that, but nothing to write home about."
4,It is what it is...,"I liked the movie. It's not winning any Academy Awards but it was funny if not predictable. It's a light, romantic comedy with a spy twist. If you are looking for an action/spy/thriller look elsewhere."
2,"Ashton's Ego or ""I'm so hot!"" by A. Kutcher","I wanted to like this movie, to be entertained and charmed. I realized after watching about five minutes of it that it's another vehicle for Ashton Kutcher to go shirtless and play the role of an irresistible hunk who can have sex with anybody he wants to because he's so well endowed and adorable. Even though he is physically attractive his personality and ego cancel it out. He's a terrible actor, the script is awful. Produced by Kutcher, it's a piece of nothing.Katherine Heigel's role is pathetic. She plays a one dimensional character who functions basically to drool over Kutcher. I can't express how awful this movie is! LOL!"
4,Killer - Review,"I like Romcoms - and Katherine Heigle and Ashton Kutcher always deliver. I enjoyed this film - not as much as Knocked Up or What Happens in Vegas, but it's still very good."
1,"Horrible. Really, really bad.","I thought this might be cute, funy, exciting, etc. It was none of those things. This movie was cringe worthy. I had trouble finishing it. I am unsure why I did finish it. Wasted time. Truely suprised at how bad this was. LAME!"
3,Killers,"Had a good time watching this one, they were so cool together, hopefully they would make more movie like this."
4,great entertainment,"Cast contains 3 stars that always make a movie more enjoyable: Katherine Heigl, Catherine O'Hara, and Ashton Kutcher. Movie was beautifully shot and scored, and although somewhat predictable, a treat none the less. Did not know about this movie, but purchased it simply for the 3 actors, and was delighted. Have never seen anything that included any of these 3 actors that I did not enjoy."
3,Lots of Light Fun and Silliness in this Romantic Comedy,"I am not sure about other bad reviews on this silly light funny romantic movies led by 2 beautiful people = Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl, but I actually enjoyed the movie. I mean, if you know Kutcher (he's a sweet eye-candy for the woman) is in a movie, you shouldn't take the movie and him too seriously. I also like Tom Selleck - he's always a good actor in whatever movie he is in. If you want to turn off your brain for 1.5 hours and have a fun movie night, this is a good film to watch with your buddies and family members."
2,Not good...,"I'm curious. What was going through Katherine Heigl's head when she heard that Ashton Kutcher was going to be her co-star in an assassin movie? ""Ashton Kutcher as a hired killer? It's a match! Where do I sign up?!""Ashton Kutcher as a hit man? Really? What's next? Sylvester Stallone playing a ballerina in the Black Swan sequel? The film was excruciatingly boring. There was a decided lack of chemistry between Heigl and Kutcher. I could only watch the first 30 minutes of this movie. I tried to stay because of Heigl, who is just getting hotter by the day. Hollywood is running out of ideas."
1,Absolute Worst Movie I've seen this year!,"Seriously, if you watch this movie, you will loathe yourself for completely throwing away precious minutes of your life. I had great hopes for this movie, great hopes that were violently crushed by the most awful story line/plot and completely pathetic ending."
1,Katherine Heigl sucks!,An awful film with 2 awful leads. Katherine Heigl is especially stinky in this movie. Her acting is tough to watch. I hope this chicks 15 minutes are finally upKatherine Heigl is unctuous.
5,Hysterical And Keeps You On The Edge Of Your Seat,"This movie was hysterical and it will keep you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen next the entire time. It has unexpected turns that will leave you either shocked or laughing hysterically. It is an incredible action/romantic comedy film. Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher were spectacular in this movie. They both were absolutely hilarious and they keep you wanting more. This movie has amazing plot that seems to change about 3 times throughout the movie in amazing ways. Everybody should watch this movie, it will definitely be worth your time. BubblesReviews.com Rating: 5 out of 5"
4,Killers: Adventure fantasy,"Killers combines excellent acting and a clever script to produce a film that belongs to the action-comedy-fantasy genre. Grab the popcorn, sit down, and be entertained."
5,Good Movie,"I usually don't care for Ashton, but he did a good job in this movie. It is well written and keeps you guessing as to what's really going on. Many twists the whole way through."
4,A FUNNY MOVIE,"A funny movie starring an atractive couple Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher, the future father in law, tries to kill the future son in law, in this comedy.Very Good sound 7.1, nice photography specially on location."
2,nonsense,"This movie starts out with promise, but then becomes stupid. The wife is supposed to be sweet, but comes off as a dumb blond. Everyone in the town is working for the bad guys out to get Kutcher? Please, can't someone write a better movie script than this mindless drivel?"
1,Worse than my low expectations,"Killers is supposed to be a spy thriller, but it is lacking on so many fronts that I cannot recommend it. Perhaps it is trying to do too much-- have too many twists and surprises that each subsequent surprise is even more ridiculous.Thumbs down!"
5,Great Escape,"If you want to have an intellectual break through go someplace else. BUT, if you want to escape the world for a short while and have some viewing fun with edge-of-the-seat excitement with an edge of humor, this movie is it. It is obvious the the two stars here are buddies and are having a great time together doing this not to mention the cojones it took for them to do what they did in the first place. In addition to that, the photography was terrific. All of that make this movie a kick in the butt to watch."
1,Warning: Deception Ahead,"--GUYS BEWARE--This is one of the worst *chick flicks* you will ever see in your life and it is disguised as an action movie.There is barely any action in this movie.In fact, the film lacks a climax entirely, as if they ran out of money (by blowing up a helicopter in the first five minutes, no doubt).I have never felt so gipped by a movie and have no felt the theater feeling so awful."
4,Lots of great fun!!!,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was a lighthearted movie with lots of humor and some great action. Ashton Kutcher looked sexy as usual and did a great job as the male lead. Katherine Heigl was fabulous playing opposite Ashton as his wife. I thought they had a great chemistry, and their banter was fun as well as believable. If you're looking for a fun movie where you can escape from your everyday worries for an hour and a half, try this movie. I think you'll have a lot of fun watching it."
2,not the best,"I've seen both of these actors play the same characters in other films - and play them better than in this canned, predictable wannabe comedy that follows a Mr and Mrs Jones plotline. Good for a saturday morning when cleaning the house...."
3,New twist for 2 established actors,"Interesting that both these stars, Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher, play roles that are reverses of what they normally play. If it weren't for Ashton's boyish looks, he'd make a darn good 'Flemingish' spy. Katherine is beautiful, as she always is, and provides the comic relief to Ashton's killer actions. There's only one word that comes to mind when considering this movie; cute. Not great, but not bad either."
2,"Good Start, Falls Flat","The movie started out good and I had high hopes for it. The chase scenes got boring and I fast forwarded over one when it went on so long. I got bored half way through. I had thought that maybe Ashton could pull this off and that he would continue as a spy and try to work around being one without KH knowing. I, for one, do not find Ashton funny. His humor is too juvenile for me. The movie got stupider and stupider if that was possible. Sigh. I did finiah the movie with a ""glad it's over"" thought. Glad I rented it and didn't pay movie house price for it."
1,One of the dumbest movies ever seen,"I expected a lot from this movie as it had 2 great actors, but this started off nice and romantic and somewhat funny, and it just got stupider and stupider, I didn't even finish watching the movie it was so worthless. Def do not buy, rent first and see if you like it."
5,Awesome!!!!,"i thought that this movie was amazing! Katherine and Ashton have great chemistry together. It was very enjoyable to watch. I loved it! There was just enough comedy, action, and romance. Would definitely recommend!"
2,It had potential...why did the producers ruin it?,"I was eager to watch this film because of the two stars: Kutcher and Heigl, but there was no plot whatsoever. There are scenes that are funny, but without a story to hold it together, it falls flat. There wasn't even a major bad guy in it. The film really feels incomplete in more ways; I was watching it and then all of a sudden, it was over! I don't even get why they were called Killers, because they were anything but. I'm glad I screened this before my husband saw it, otherwise, that would have been a date night spoiled. Avoid this film and if you really want to, borrow it for free from your public library."
1,Waste of money,I am a big fan of both actors and this movie was very dissappointing. Really boring. I am sorry I bought it.
1,WORST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS!!!!,"IT Disguusts me to even address how awful this movie is, It was proobably made in one day!!! This is garbage!!!"
1,Painful to Watch,"I absolutely hated this movie. I watched the first half hour and was bored out of my mind. I fast forwarded thru the rest. Katherine Heigel always plays the prude stuck up woman, she can never seem to try something new or get out of her comfort zone. I Do Not recommend."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"I think this movie would have been better if Ashton Kutcher could have laughted once or maybe twice. You could tell that there were suppose to be some funny moments but Ashton was so serious. The plot had a twist and the ""killers"" are not who you think they are, and that's is what saves this movie, it's unpredictible. Katherine Heigl is great, as always. I would say, watch if it's available to you, but don't go out of your way. Ciao."
2,Falls flat,"Somehow, it had all the pieces to make a great action comedy. An assassin retires to Suburbia USA with a wife who knows nothing of his red-handed past. Irritating in-laws and a strange daddy dependency. Cheery neighbors. Going to be parents. Then, for no apparent reason, everyone from his drinking buddy, to the fedex driver, to the block party organizer suddenly shows up with laser-sighted rifles, body armor, and a real urge to drop him out of the game. There are some fun chase scenes, but this never really comes to life. Jen, his wife, rarely gets past pettish annoyance. The positive pregnancy test didn't add a lot either, despite its potential.Well, at least I didn't pay money to see it.-- wiredweird"
1,Not a happy Customer,"I bought this printer cartridge hoping to avoid lower performance from the very cheap priced online products, yet be able to get a cartridge lower in price than Epson. I just bought the cartridge several days ago and followed the directions which suggested using the nozzle check (check for clean nozzles). Upon first use there was gaps/lines in the text. The ink also blurred quite often. I attempted to clean the nozzles through my printer and they seemed to improve slightly. Slightly is not good enough though as the printing still smudged and left lines even after at least seven cleanings. Overall, this product has the performance generally lower or at least equal to the cheap unknown cartridges. Save yourself the hassle and avoid this swing and miss."
4,compatable to the epson cartridges,"I recently purchased this product for use in my C64 printer, and the only difference that I saw was the ink lasted much longer then the Epson ink."
4,Hypnotic!,"While reading ""Me and the Fat Man"" I kept telling myself I hated it. I didn't like any of the characters, mainly because they didn't like themselves. However, the story would not let me go--I couldn't wait to see what in the world would happen to these people next. This book is a short read and well worth the couple of hours I spent on it."
5,Great for the price,"This is a great budget collection of some of The Cathedrals' finest music. The Cathedrals are one of the premiere southern Gospel quartets of all time. Their performance of ""Movin' Up to Gloryland"" has become a standard. While this is not a comprehensive collection and probably not the best available, for the price it is outstanding."
3,Overall....Interesting and Fun!,"Overall, I liked this book. However, the book doesn't get really interesting until the second half of the book. You just need to be patient with the first part because it does eventually become interesting. Sure, Eliste is selfish at the beginning but that part is unnecessarily drawn out. One keeps thinking, where the heck is Dref? (And why doesn't Aurelie just kick the bucket already?) For me, Dref was the most entertaining because he was the most charming and intelligent person in the book. I guess what I'm saying is that we don't need to know that much about the Exalted ways. It's all a bunch of fluff. But again overall, fun book."
4,Excellent,"I was a little concerned before reading this- I'd studied some on the French Revolution and thought this just might be a little too close. In a way it was, but in a way it wasn't. It had the interest and flavor, but the story was thoroughly engrossing, the characters interesting, the writing excellent. The plot moves along swiftly. My only complaint is that the whole novel seems to be written with a probably unnecessarily upper-class air. Were a character the narrator it would have been more appropriate. Still, a wonderful read and highly recommended."
3,Illusion,"Worldbuilding is the strength in this novel, set in an 18th century-like world rather than the tired generic medieval of too many fantasy novels. Some nice touches of steampunk, though underutilized, liven things up. The world is detailed, believable and interesting.Illusion is the story of a revolution, and the ugliness and evils of revolution are clearly well known to the author.However, the stereotypical and somewhat one-dimensional characters (the heroine is spunky with a heart-shaped face, and so on) are a weakness. Though the plot moves along well, there are some holes in it (why do the nits of Nu-Nu only appear when it's convenient for the plot?). However, the author does show a pleasant willingness to be grim. The tone is a slightly distant third-person POV, which kept me from engaging as much as I would have liked to.I recommend this book as an example of strong worldbuilding, even though I would have preferred more individual characters."
2,Am I the only one who just didn't get it?,"I must be an oddball, but this book really didn't grab me at all. It seemed like the author thought that by adding a few spells to the French Revolution, she would have a great story. But give me a real French Revolution novel any day - the characters didn't come to life for me in this one. Magic is great, but only if the characters have substance - it can't carry a novel. Go read some Mercedes Lackey or Marion Zimmer Bradley instead."
3,Looks can be deceiving,"I was disappointed in both of these dvd's. ( I purchased the 2 pack beginner and the advanced) Had it been anyone else I might have been less disappointed but even for a beginner workout expected a more intense workout for these two.Sugar Ray rarely says a word and Laila and most of the crew do nothing to motivate you. There is one girl in the back that does appear to be putting forth some effort so I tried to focus on her.I was so shocked I took the DVD to work to show a co-worker. We both had the same thought when we saw the box - that Laila looks fantasic on the cover and it must be a great workout, but even my co-worker who never works out had to laugh. Her comment was that Layla does not get that body from this workout.This would be great for someone who is very sedentary that wants to start working out. It's very easy to follow and nothing too strenuous, but you can burn some calories."
2,good warm up,"Very short video, I use it as a warm up. For two champion fighters they're not very enthusiastic on the video.Good warmup...that's about it."
4,An interesting book... now to learn how to do it...,"I take classes and am amazed when instructors read all of us in the class. I then buy these books and find them fascinating too, and realize that the only way to learn how to read people, understand them and do what is taught in these books... is to interact with people. Unless you are in a job or routinely in social situations... taking what these books offer and implementing it... is a bit more challenging. That said, i thought this book was a pretty good read."
5,"Easy to grasp, very practical","Have already successfully used its easy to grasp, practical information on identifying and communicating with the sixteen types of people."
5,Must Read,If you want to understand people better than they know theirselves you have to get this book.
1,OVER-STEREOTYPES PEOPLE!,"The Art of SpeedReading People completely overstereotypes people. I do not beleive that you can learn someone's personality type in such a short amount of time. Personality is to deep to quickly read someone's personality type. The author's have not helped the subject, in my opinion, with this book."
1,TOO SEXIST!!,"Midge has ditched Alan and Ryan so she can go on a girls-only shopping spree with Nikki and the new baby. Why didn't they (Midge, Nikki and the baby) bring Alan and Ryan with them, like they did in the Hometown Fair giftset? I think this is a mere example of teaching you that you should act sexist, like ''boys are too dumb to go grocery shopping.'' I disagree with that. In short, I DO NOT WANT THIS!! IT'S TOO SEXIST!!"
4,great toy,i have this toy and i think that its the best midge doll yet the need to make a new alan and ryan for this set i have every midge doll ever i have only one alan and ryan though. they should have made another pregnant midge beacause midge just had another baby they should also put the name of the new baby on there i have the white people not the negroes! but i really want the black ones i have the familymoble and the baby storeand the grannys kitchen sets and the doctor barbie and need more stuff!im 11
3,"Good idea, but Sudoku doesn't work as a board game...","My 4-yr-old loves Sudoku, so we were eager to play this game. It is a great IDEA but Sudoku just doesn't work as a board game. Occasionally you have to guess where to put a piece, and if you guess wrong and later unwind the card, it gets a little crazy (in real Sudoku this is not a problem). Also the patterns across the grid are ""inverses"" of each other - hard to explain here but you will realize it pretty quickly when you start playing. Better to start little ones with the 4x4 grid sticker books (NickJR has a bunch). Still, it is fun to play."
2,Many words but little information.,"I bought this textbook for my surgical rotation as a stage 3 medical student because it was the prescribed text, and I had found a positive review here. Imagine my surprise when I found out the book was poorly written and scant on illustrations. The text alternates between being so vague that you can't take anything away from it to providing isolated facts that aren't helpful to build the larger picture. I gave up on this text after some time and bought 'Essential Surgery', which is much better (organisation, illustrations, photographs)."
4,A different kind of romance,"I am not normally a reader of romance novels. I usually read thrillers or mysteries. But I figures why not try it, it is free. I really was surprised by this book and enjoyed it.I not being a romance novel fan actually liked the way the book did not end all Candy and Roses. But just like the other reviewer did not care for the spoiled brat lil sister either. I am getting the other books by this auther on my kindle."
4,Love quadrangle?,The story line was enough to keep you wadding through the book. It got a bit boring because you could see the ending coming about half-way through the text.
4,Sisters!!,"Well written, interesting, predictable, NOT funny, tragic! I got the book because some of the reviews said it was funny. NOT!"
2,I like the girls that do,Back in the 70's when this movie came out it was probably very erotic but by todays standard it's luke warm. The acting is ok and there is a plot behind the movie. The dvd sound is not great but you can tell what's happeneing. You should rent it first before you but it so you don't get disappointed. The cover girls are not in the movie so don't buy it for that.
4,My daughter LOVES this movie!,We got this video at the grocery store and my daughter loves it! If your child likes the Baby Einstein videos I think that they'll like these videos. There's a lot of singing and CRAZY puppet action!!! It's very entertaining. I'm going to order Your Tiny Maestro right now!
4,Great for shorter cords,"I have these on some of my extra cords at work. They are really easy to use and look better than wads of extra cords secured by cable ties. The product info says it holds 8' of standard cord. I guess I'm not sure what constitutes standard cord. I have about 3' of computer cable in one and it is full. Another has about 1' of ethernet cable and it is about 1/2 full. I have one with 3' of lamp cord (that goes from the lamp to the electrical outlet) in it and it is full. So, while I find them useful and will buy them again when I have a need, I'm not sure what type of cord you would use to fit 8' in there. One other thing, because they are made for stacking, there is a nodule on the bottom of each, meant to be inserted into the top of another. This means that the bottom side (not the dome side) will not lie flat. I would prefer it if they would like flat, as I have them on my desk, but I'll live with it."
4,Not bad.,"If I could, I'd give these about 3.5 stars since they're a little better than 3, but not quite worthy of 4. I bought these because I had a lot of speaker wire crammed behind my computer desk and wanted to clean things up. I suppose these little things do their job, although my biggest complaint is that they don't hold very much at all. I had to use the ENTIRE package of these just for my speaker wire (and it really wasn't all that much). On the plus side though, I think they're a pretty decent quality. I'm not sure I'd buy them again. I think I'd try a different product in search of something a little more efficient."
4,Gone in Two Days,"I bought this for my husband and he must have liked it, because he ate the whole bag in two days. Shipping rates were really high. Probably won't buy again because of that."
1,WORST BOOK I EVER READ,"This book's characters totally lacked any depth. One minute someone is having a nervous breakdown and the next she is standing up in a wedding. As far as the ""Big Plot Twist"" regarding parentage, what a joke! It seemed like she ran out of ideas and just threw this in to keep the ""story"" going.Fern Michaels (whom I normally LOVE)really messed this one up."
1,Really Really BAD!,"I can't say this was the worst book ever written, but it was the worst book I've ever read. I can't imagine how it has gotten so many good reviews. I almost can't believe Fern Michael's wrote it. The characters are completely one dimensional, the plot makes no sense, and the whole thing is riddled with inconsistancies. The worst though, is the dialogue. Completely unrealistic. Very dissappointed. I kept holding out, hoping it would get better, but gave up about halfway through. This is first book that I was so fed up with, that I wasn't able to finish."
2,"Glad ""Yesterday"" is gone.","A very juvenile story. At first I loved Mama Pearl, but towards the end I wasn't sure. Her superstitions and biases caused all of the kids a lot of hearache. She felt guilty because of Cally & used Bode to provide for her ""baby."" The book is a downer."
3,"Passable, but long","This book wasn't too bad. I did find the characters to be somewhat wishy-washy and you never really knew what to expect (not really in a good way). I enjoyed reading about the time the characters spent as children most of all. It made you understand more the bitterness and resentment that they all seemed to have for one another. However, Callie's manipulation of all the rest seemed to be unfounded and a little hard to believe. This was the first Fern Michaels book I read (I have read another before writing this review) and this one was kind of too long to really keep me hooked the whole time. It could have had about 100 pages less and been easier to understand and follow. Not the best book I ever read, but, overall, it was an amusing way to pass the time."
5,One of a kind!,"This book brought home to me all my own yesterdays. I cannot in words, tell you how much I enjoyed this wonderful book. I recommend it highly and tell everyone about it. I truly, truly enjoyed each character and I fell in love with Mama Pearl. I did some giggling, I laughed out loud and I cried. I couldn't wait to turn each page. Do you know what I missed in this book? There were no animals. I have come to expect them in each book this author writes. It's a given that I will read this book again and again over the years as my own yesterdays fade from my mind. Thank you so much for the hours of joy and entertainment you give me with each of your books."
2,Crash and Burn,"The premise of the novel is a promising one: Brie, Bode, Sela and Callie are four best friends brought up together to think of one another as siblings under the watchful eye of Mama Pearl. They all meet back up as Callie plans the wedding of the century to the affluent Wyn. The set up of the story goes off beautifully and drew me in... but then the story crashed and burned. There are far too many holes in this story and the stories that are completed are so unreal it cheapens the story even more. I would reccomend that one should borrow this novel, as I did, rather than pay for it.Oh and why oh why does Fern switch from Bode to Bawdey? I don't know why but this was one thing that really bothered me the most!"
2,Hated it!,"I thought this book was horrendous. There were no especially likable characters, with the possible exception of Hatch. The thing was so long winded it was hard to keep track of people. The characters changed personalities so wildly that I couldn't identify with any of them. Not worth the time or paper in my opinion."
1,Horrible book,Horrible horrible horrible.. Bode is black and then white.. can't people see for themselves using their eyes.. this is the weirdest thing..
5,Extraordinary tale of true friendship,"This was a wonderful story of true friendship. Everyone was so real, like friends you've had all your life. The author allowed us to see them grow and mature and to see their faults and their strengths and how they took on life with gusto and how when the going got tough they all pulled together the way they had when they were children. I saw my own yesterdays in this book. It was so good I didn't want it to end. Anyone who didn't get a message out of this book didn't read it properly.Carol Mezner"
3,NOT a comfortable beach read!,"I admit, I couldn't stop thinking about this book when I put it down, but I'm still not sure that I enjoyed it. I never knew how to feel about the characters and that left me feeling unsettled. The story centers on the main characters (childhood friends back together as adults) as they come to terms with their true feelings about each other. Mama Pearl is the only character who is strong and steady through the whole novel. Her attitudes and actions make sense; she's a character who is easy to love. The rest of the characters spend most of the novel contradicting themselves, leaving me wondering which ones I'm supposed to like and which ones I'm supposed to hate.It all eventually comes together into a story with characters that make sense, but the trip there is difficult. If you want to read an interesting character study, read this book. If you're looking for a light-hearted beach read, this isn't it."
5,OUTSTANDING,"I truly adored this book,I was unable to putit down until I finished it ! I have never read this author before. She is great Callie reminded me of Scarlett a little..LOVED THE BOOK!"
3,Yesterday,"I have had a hard time getting into this book. I usually love to read Fern Michaels books, but this one I have not even finished. I will probably get to it eventually."
1,Painful read.,"I have never written a review before, but this book was such a let down, I hope I can save someone else the trouble. The writing was so choppy, and the characters' were so whiney. She has def. written better books."
2,Hmmm,"This was an okay book. I do have one thought. In the end hatch littletree marries sela, however in another book in the ""Kentucky"" series hatch marries nealy. So what happens to hatch and sela? I do believe yesterday was written first. Fern uses the same character in two different books. If there is another book with hatch in it I would like to know or if fern michaels uses same characters in different books."
4,Dina's Book Review,Dina's book was quite a reader's adventure. Not only did I learn about historical fiction but about a world totally unknown to me from the mid 1800's. Dina was an interesting character from the start and trying to get inside her head is what make this book so interesting. One could never quite figure out her next move and that continued until the very last page. This book was a very easy read that kept me coming back for more.
5,Norwegian life,"A very fetching book, that is if you're into Northern European stories. If you get depressed by the thought of long winters... don't start upon it. But if you do like the atmosphere (and i do) it's very, very good. Dina is a very strong woman who grows up in the northern part of Norway around 1900. She is involved in an accident in which her mother dies and this has a very profound effect on the rest of her life, and that of her son and granddaughter. The life's of both (son and granddaughter) are told in the sequels 'Benjamin's book' and 'Karna's book' (i'm not sure about the titels since i read them in Dutch)."
1,Dissappointing,"Picked this up in a bookshop with a view to buying it. Like most folks, I went straight to my own name and found the information relating thereto inaccurate, poorly researched and misleading. That was enough for me to give it a hearty thumbs down. My recommendation - buy one of MacLysaght's book instead."
4,"A meaty, seemingly thorough dictionary of names...","I was not at all displeased with this book (as the two previous reviewers were.) I find it full of interesting information about a number of names I know (including Haggarty.) It gives several pronunciations, talks about the meaning of a name, and tells us about some of the more famous people who've held the name. I'd buy it again."
3,Too many English names.,I ordered the book thinking that my mother's name Brannagan would be in there for sure. I was very disappointed.
4,A great album!,"I loved Lauren's first album and I love this one almost just as much. Lauren returns in this album with her signature soulful southern sound that she is so well known for. If you like Southern Gospel, this album and her first should definitely be in your collection!"
3,"Good so far, worth the wait in money.","Attention!!! Do not buy the disc. Go to the Kuma War website and download this game for free. I got burned by buying the disc and being told by Kuma War tech support that the disc is no longer recognized. Be prepared for about 3 to 4 hours of download time for the game menu, then another 3 to 4 hours to download all the missions (72 total at this time)."
2,Impressive music but BORING and almost TOO Technical,I love Tech Death Metal but this CD just isn't for everyone. IMO this CD will test even the most hardened tech death metal fans chops. Just not enough riffage for my taste. Beware all the 5 star reviews you might just hate this CD.
5,I'll Make This Short...,"...as the other reviews basically took the words out of my mouth. This CD has some of the greatest solos mixed with a high classical influence. Drumming is superb, so is the bass. This, in my opinion, is Necrophagist's greatest work. Not thatEpitaphis a bad album (I love that album too), but I have never heard album as complex, as mindblowing, and as magnificantly written as ""Onset of Putrefaction"". Buy it. Now."
3,Definatelly not 5 stars...,"We used this book for my Stability and Control class in UCLA and I have to say that almost all of my classmates hated it! It is full of mistakes and misprints, almost no examples and the very limited ones are hard to understand. You need a very strong back ground or a really good professor to understand this book. On the other hand, it was handy for Boeing 747 and Cherokee stats. Therefore I can not say ""do not buy it"" but at least look for a better one."
3,THE SECOND EDITION IS NO BETTER THAN THE FIRST,I have both editions of this book. The first one was not so good; the second is still worse. It is the first edition with some few changes and many misprints. The introduction of some computer programs does not make this book an up-to-date one.It is still an old book with just a colorfull cover.
1,Not worth it,"Unfortunately had to use this one for two corses. It's a paperweight and nothing more. The set up of the text is good but most of the time it felt like the guy got bored. Basically, here is a start and the rest do your own reasearch. If you have lots of spare time on your hands, this book is for you. If not, try David Anderson's books instead."
2,Useless for school,"Had to buy this book for an Aircraft Performance class. This book is straight trash. For all homework assignments I used three books: John Anderson's Fund. of Aerodynamics, James John's Gas Dynamics book, and a Fluid Mechanics book I had from the previous semester. Notice how I didn't use this book for anything beside the problem statements..."
2,Lacks real life applicable scenarios,"I bought this book hoping it would be better than the late edition. The books is once again very theoretical, dry-cut models that at times drifts you away from hand on experiments. It also lacks thorough explanations or real life examples, theory derivations, and any sort of useful explanation. If you are looking for a good book go with White's book, has the same theory, but you will actually learn how to apply it.Any reputable university (UCLA, MIT, Cal Tech, SDSB...) science library carry a lot of aerodynamics books that by far can help you understand the concept with more applicable scenarios."
2,Eh....,As others have said this book is whatever. The author seems apathetic and looks down on students in general. It's as if someone made him write this book against his will.
5,Great Book,After reading countless books and magazine articles from my local library this book pulls it all together. I highly recommend this book for anyone considering building kitchen cabinets. If your new to woodworking it would be worth you time to pick up this book but only after getting a few small projects under belt and gaining some basic knowledge of wookworking
2,Not enough info,"Too many projects and not enough information. I felt like it was written for more experienced woodworkers. A little brushup then off to the projects. Next time I'll use the ""look inside"" feature before buying."
4,HOW TO BUILD BOXES,Overall a good work. This is a good guide for the begining woodworker who is remodeling a kitchen. stresses the authors favorite tool to the point it could be suspected that Krieg underwrote the book.
4,Good book,"Decent book but a little disappointing. Nice mention of pocket screws and their usage. It has a lot of good info, but being at an intermediate level, I had to read a lot of text to learn anything new. I would say this is a good book for beginners and less useful for intermediate level carpenters."
3,Not bad but I expected more illustrations,"The book covered some great information, but I felt it could have had better pictures to explain the concepts."
2,Building Kitchen Cabinets,nice book good iilustrations but too vague I needed more detail on actually making cabinets
4,Well Explained and Illustrated,"This book is easy to read and the illustrations are informative, well setout and well explained examples and project. Thanks for puplishing this book it will come in handy"
5,Great gift idea,"This was an IOU for a real Bulldog for my girlfriend. It was priced right, being a gag gift and all, and she is in love with it."
4,Sharon is called to the Tenderloin District,"Private Investigator Sharon McCone is called by a group of Vietnamese tenants who live in the so-called Tenderloin District of San Francisco. This is a very rough area, where new immigrants trying to make a go of it in their adopted country rub elbows with eccentrics and criminals. The group of people who are employing Sharon want her to find out who is playing tricks on them in their apartment building. There are strange noises in the basement, power failures, and shadows of ""ghosts"" on the walls. During the course of the investigation, Sharon develops real admiration for the Vietnamese and is chagrined when one of them is killed and another disappears. She pursues several dead ends before she finally figures out who is responsible for the murder and the other mischief. Muller consistantly writes good books in this series, and this one is no exception."
3,a little disappointed,"I'm a novice storyteller, and I was looking forward to finally hearing the renowned Jim Weiss, especially sharing spooky tales. He does an adequate job voicing the different characters, but I was disappointed at the lack of humor displayed at what could have been comical events. I now know these stories well enough to tell them better myself!"
4,Beautiful.,A most interesting film. Beautifully photographed and choreographed. The training process is fascinating.
5,Best Kung Fu Film,"This movie (Shaolin Master Killer is another title for it) is an excellent Kung Fu film and stars a young Gordon Liu. If you have not seen this film, then what are you waiting for??"
3,"Great training scenes, cliche story, HORRIBLE SOUND!","The sound quality really detracts, much worse than your average bootleg even (though admittedly around the same price). Gordon Liu is one of the best kung fu movie actors, his fighting is topnotch, and his expressions and face are great for the films too."
5,Best karate movie ever.,I remember watching a lot of martial arts films on Saturday as a kid. The one that stuck in my mind the most was this one. It had the most serious training scenes I had ever seen and inspired me to eventually take up the martial arts for real.
5,Great Classic Movie,"a great classic movie but if you buy this movie dont expect too much plot or intrigue so on, the majority of this movie is training sequences a man learning kungfu in a Shaolin Temple."
3,"Good flick, bad transfer, even worse sound","Shaolin Master Killer is a great movie, lots of action, training, and fighting scenes. The story line is a bit hokey but the martial arts fighting scenes more than make up for it. The training scenes at the Shaolin temple in the 35 Chambers are amazing. Liu truly does a fantastic job. However, the final fight between Liu and the Manchu general is rather short especially the ending. The transfer is not good but you can deal with it. The sound is the real atrocity here, at times you really can't hear anything the characters are saying and even when you can the track is so low that you have to blast your tv. Anyway, this is definitely worth owning, good luck trying to find it on DVD!"
4,An interesting film.,This film is about a school who apposes the Manchurians. The Manchurians find out about their underground plan to overthrow their rule and kill everyone in the school except one who escapes to shaolin and trains. He is a very quick learner and soon finishes his training. He then gets his revenge and gets permission from shaolin to teach kung fu to non monks. This film follows many of the shaolin training techniques from beginning to end and has a very good story line.
3,"Great Movie, mediocre Blu-ray","This is simply based upon the transfer. Not an upgrade from my DVD; truly one of the worst ""transfers"" out there. But one of the best movies. Buy the blu-ray only if you don't already have it on DVD. It's a five star movie with a one star transfer."
5,36Th Chamber of the Shaolin,"This is a classic movie of a Chinese Story about the Famous Shaolin Temple. The story is about a man who wants to become a Monk but the Monastary will only take him as a Laborer. In the story he is finally accepted as a student and he enters the training as a novice in the 35 chambers, each chamber has a Master. After he completes the 35 chambers he becomes a Monk of great Stature and knowledge. In the end a 36th chamber is created for him to teach the students in. This is One for the Collection, I got mine what about you?Peace,Aikimike"
4,I should have studied Kung Fu,"This is not just a good kung fu movie, but a good movie. The story is good, the editing, the film quality, the sound and music editing. I hadn't seen the movie before I ordered the DVD, and I was pleasantly surprised. I think I was expecting something more over the top and strange - and that would have been fine too - but this is good in a less cheesy way."
3,Not as good as reviewed.,"Original Kung Fu epic, but would not waste my money on blu-ray. DVD quality good enough."
3,blah,"This is really a blah type of movie, I fell asleepWhile watching it. I'm thinking of watching it againBut I'd really just rewatch any of Donnie Yen's movies.Just bought it because it's cheap and I want toenlarge my bluray collection."
1,Cheap Bootleg,"Dont buy this outdated bootleg, the remastered version is here:The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"
1,Avoid this bootleg,"This DVD is a poor quality bootleg. The real U.S. title of this film is ""Master Killer"", but the original title is ""36th Chamber of Shaolin"". A company called Celestial owns the worldwide copyright on ALL Shaw Brothers movies. Their digitally remastered DVD has been available for a couple of years, and puts this bootleg to shame. That catch is that you must purchase it from a Hong Kong based web site. Amazon is not allowed to sell it, so they have listed this bootleg. Find a Hong Kong based web site and purchase the official DVD!"
2,Guy above was 100% right about the sound quality,"Awesome movie...this was one of the regulars on Channel 26 Kung Fu Theater here in Houston. Fight scenes can sometimes get a little slow, but the Shaolin training aspect of it was really cool. Main hero's father and business are destroyed by bloodthirsty Manchus. Hero escapes and joins Shaolin Temple...he completes all 35 chambers of Shaolin training and creates the 36th to teach Shaolin fighting techniques to the common man so that they can drive the Manchus from China. The guy who wrote the previous review was right, tho, you have to crank the volume to hear what they are saying...fortunately, the sound effects are mixed at the same low volume...sound still isn't very crisp. Unfortunately, this is probably the only DVD version that will be released. :( My rating of 3 is on the quality of the DVD...definately not on the movie!"
5,As good as they said it is.,"There are many excellent reviews already.I read them, purchased the DVD and watched it.Great action, reminded me of the old Bruce Lee movies with action that doesn't look like it required lots of special effects processing.I'm happy I purchased it."
2,Terrible sound ruins movie!,"The movie's awesome but the horrible sound quality makes it hard to sit through. You can't hear any of the dialogue unless you turn up the volume real high, but then all the sound effects become deafening. Buy it because it's a classic, but know you will be disappointed."
2,Good movie deserves better VHS treatment,"If only someone had warned me that this video was prerecorded in EP mode before I purchased it. That's right, EP mode (also known as SLP mode). The picture and sound are just terrible, even for an EP title.Save your bucks for the DVD version, which (I hope) has better picture and sound and will offer this classic martial arts film the presentation it deserves."
5,Great Film!!,"I have to say, this is without a doubt one of the best martial art flicks I have seen in my life. The transition to 1080p is good especially when you take into account this was shot over 30 years ago. All in all it was a great buy."
4,Got sore just watching,I do not know how much of what is shown is the real training the monks get but this movie is most enjoyable to watch.
4,Kodak C360- Super easy to use & nice picture quality,"Kodak C360- ($129+)This camera is very easy to use because it has automatic popup text messages that tells you what each setting is, the battery life is good (you should buy rechargeable batteries and 1GB of memory), and the picture quality is good even under low light conditions. (Night/close-ups - You need to try different settings so your images do not look grainy or dark.) The unlimited movie play/record mode (depending on your memory card) is awesome. The playback is loud and clear. Other cameras did not do as well. And I really like the flashing green light when the camera is turned on/off - just like a cell phone."
5,I love this camera,"I really don't understand all the complaints about this camera. I have never experienced any of the problems that the others have had. In fact, it's perfect. Takes great pictures, regardless of the setting (indoor or outdoor). The videos are awesome. It's sooo easy to use, that my 3 year old son even takes fantastic pictures with it. And, it's clearly durable, as he's dropped it many times, and there's not a scratch on it. You can take multiple pictures at one time, which is nice, because you can capture those pictures that would be gone in a flash. I really think this is a great camera!!!!"
5,a Great Book - long overdue!,"I had the priviledge to study the Nimmo technique under Dr. Laws in her practice. I have copies of many of the original articles reproduced in this book.Nimmo was certainly ahead of his time in addressing myofascial adhesions as a root of pain, dysfunction, and symptomatology. If you have ever read or studies Travell's work - then you need to see this book.The biggest problem with this book is that it is not widely available - I have contacted Dr. Laws to get a copy - I strongly recommend you do the same. Every practitioner of manual therapy - chiropractor, osteopath, of massage therapist - should have this text in their library."
5,Conway Twitty Love Songs,I bought this CD for some of his early hits that are not on his later CD's.His early hits are excellent!!
1,Lacking essential song,"The original ""LOVE SONGS"" by Conway had the title song ""I'd Love To Lay You Down"". In this copy version the song was missing...a gret disappointment!"
1,Contains Phenylalanine!!,"I purchased these vitamins, only to get them home and realize they contain phenylalanine. Conveniently, they put that little fact on the opposite side of the label from the nutrition facts. Luckily I saw it before I took them, but I am out the cost of the entire bottle. I think it is insane that any prenatal vitamin would contain phenylalanine, and they definitely appear to be trying to hide that information, so buyer beware!!"
1,Not enough folic acid - unless you take 4 horsepills a day!,"The recommended amount of folic acid to take daily before pregnancy is 400 mg. I glanced at the ""supplement facts"" and saw ""800 mg"" and bought this product, faithfully taking 1 tablet a day. This morning I happened to notice that the 800 mg is per serving - which is 4 giant pills a day! Even my ""One a Day"" vitamins have 400 mg in just one vitamin! I am so angry at myself and this riduculous company and scared that I will become pregnant now."
3,Too morose,"I like Berry's poetry very much, but not this collection. It is just too preoccupied with death and dying to suit my taste. I'll buy more of his poetry in the future, just not this one."
5,Best Chamomile tea,"I drink this every night after dinner and before bed. I've tried lots of other brands of chamomile but this one tastes the best and I love how each one is wrapped sealing in the freshness. I find other brands really bland, I mean this is a bland tea in itself but this brand has a great taste and seems somewhat stronger than the rest. Mixed with fresh REAL local honey, it's really relaxing!!!"
5,One of the best!,I am not a tea expert but I sure can tell a good one from bad. This is one of the best chamomile teas I've ever had.
3,Great - Wife loved them.,A very nice product. Wife loved them. They are a light blue color and not too vivid but a nice and subtle blue.
4,"Great deal, the blue topas color is lighter than expected","I got this as the gold box deal and price is very attractive. I've always been a fan of blue gem stones and this set offers a nice combination of the topaz with the silver. The downside is the blue color was lighter than I expected, the blue color is a bit too transparent for me. But with the price I paid, I am happy with the purchase."
2,Not That Impressed,"This was a cute little container with two shades of concealer, but neither one of them really was a ""killer"" cover. I've had much better coverage from Covermark and Dermablend. It covers things that every other concealer covers, but nothing more."
5,"The best of growth literature in a readable, usable package","Jim Cathcart has done an amazing job with the Acorn Principle.I first heard him speak about this a couple of years ago. That speech helped me understand my son and our relationship in ways that changed us both for the better.Now comes this book, full of the best insights from the best research. Read it an you'll learn how to understand yourself and others, about how people learn and grwo.And, if you go beyond just reading, the material here can help you change your life and relationships.The book won't do that changing for you, but it will give you a map, guidelines and encouragement.This book will be a classic.Wally Bock"
2,Do not rush to get Acorn,"I thought for the most part that the book is not so much a look inside yourself, but how you can make yourself more apealing to what is outside. In many ways than not, the book starts with you then says forget it here's a plan to just go and get it, whether you are that type of person or not. The success stories are great, but if you are not developed enough of who you are and use the book as a stepping stone, then you're probably going to rethink this approach. A better alternative that has been around a lot longer, ""What Color is Your Parachute."""
1,To little information about Regions,The movie would not work in my DVD player as it was the wrong Region. If I would have known that DVD players were specific to Regions I could have saved $25 dollars. Will not make the same mistake next time.
4,Family FUN,"This is a fun for the whole family movie. Everyone from grandma to tikes should find this one entertaining. Lots of laughs, some ohs, some ahs but a sweet ride. If only it were on DVD."
2,Bigger and better of things to come.,"I admit I was spoiled having bought ""Frosting On The Beater "" first and then ""Dear 23"". ""Failure"" to me was just that...it failed to capture me. I found some of the songs far too long winded and bland. Sure...it was their first outting, but there wasnt much in the songwriting that compelled me to think that anything was to come of these two..being Auer and Stringfellow.Thankfully I was wrong. If anything, I felt ""Success"" sounded more like it could have been their debut cd. So...for me, this cd is a must pass."
4,Holy Cow,"I completely forgot about this album/tape/CD. I remember when a friend of mine brought the cassette over when it was first released @ Tower Records in Tacoma, WA. We were punk/The Cult/U2 fans, but something about the songs on Failure made me want to listen to it over and over again. The clever lyrics, the heavy accoustic guitars, the harmonizing voices...all of it. A truly wonderful piece of work & I believe it was all done in one of the band leader's father's home studio."
5,Just Proves Some of the Best Things in Life are Still Free,"It's tough to get good advice about how to publicize a product or service. In fact, most people don't even think about it until all the work on the product is done. Somehow, with all the sweat that goes into getting the product or service ""out the door"" folks forget that it takes a heck of a lot of hard work to market the finished creation.Thanks to another well-done product by George McKenzie, you can relax while listening to audio tapes about what it takes to get free advertising, how to get radio, tv, newpaper PR folks lined up on ""your"" side for a change. Face it, this guy's a master and if you ever needed anyone to take you by the hand to show you the ropes... this is the guy and this is the product! Highly recommended!"
1,20 pages ha!!!,"My company bought me this stapler when my old one broke. It says that it will go through 20 pages.... Yeah right. I have a hard time getting it to go through 2 pages sometimes. I'm just trying to staple standard paper, nothing fancy. Don't buy this stapler, it is awful."
3,Light weight use only,"These work ok but they are really for light weight stapling. I teach high school and don't see these lasting long. Plus, if the spring gets bent in these they will not staple right. I have had to fix these several times. It is also almost impossible to staple items on to my classroom walls with these. A normal stapler will do this easily."
3,cream?,this stuff is so thin I don't know how it is considered cream... it seems very watery to me... I gave it a week of daily use but it seems to do nothing
1,Do nothing except waste of money,"I heard about this Udderly Smooth from a coworker whose daughter is in diabetic and used these products. I also saw many good reviews about this hand cream and tried it. It doesn't moisturize my hands and feel very watery. A couple of weeks later, I found out the contents split into water and awful liquids in the bottle. Waste of money.If you are very intersting in these USmooth just because of such great reviews, try a tiny amount from local stores."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed that there were not more hats from the 1770's. I guess many did not survive. The Shoes from Snowhill had better variety of shoes.
5,Great production,"I have every Masters highlights tape since 1990. Each one of them is excellent, and the quality of the production unmatched. And as always, the action from the Masters never disappoints."
4,Pretty good.,"I like having sporting events on DVD vs. VHS. Quality of this one is good. Don't expect too many 'extra' features. If you want a good recap of the 2001 Masters, this will do. The post tournament conference with Tiger is pretty interesting too to watch."
4,"Pretty good, but poor quality.","I thought the coverage of the tourney was great and the full post interview was interesting, would've like some more players thoughts I guess though. However, the picture quality is fairly poor even by DVD standards. When the ball is a square, literally, on the screen during a putt you know the resolution is bad. Besides the annoyingly bad picture, it great to watch Tiger win his fourth straight major."
2,Not what I thought or hoped........,"When I purchased ""Hog on Ice"", I expected a book with hundreds of expressions along with the historical origin of each. The books does indeed have hundreds of expressions and what they mean, but the author, when describing the origin, rarely gives a definite answer. The origins frequently have phrases like, ""probably came from"", ""could have been"", ""it is likely that"", etc. A great book if you only want to be entertained by learning new expressions and the meaning behind some you already know. As a historical reference, however, you may want to check out Garrisons' ""Why you Say It""."
4,Interesting rather than enthralling,"The book covers a good number of expressions, many of which I've heard before and others I haven't. There is usually around two expressions on each page. The short explanation covers the meaning of the phrase and, if he knows it, the origin."
5,It's Here Now (Are You?): A Spiritual Memoir,"Bhagavan Das' book is more than a spiritual memoir -- it's a magical mystery tour de force. I'm into my second reading as the book probably needs to be read three times before capturing all the many characters, sights, smells and most importantly insights. His connection to Divine Mother Shaktipad streams from boyhood days with his grandmother to his manhood days with his paramours. In his recounting he is storyteller and teacher - making the direct experience of the Divine Mother so very real to the reader (aka seeker.) This book is a must read - several times over!"
4,Good at face value,"Bhagavan Das sounds honest with most of this text, which, given some of the unbelievable extremities of his account, is quite an accomplishment and I'm more willing to believe his story. The reader will probably be left with lots of questions along the way, but it does fill in a lot of holes left over from Be Here Now. He also gives a lot of info on 60s India and 70s 'spiritual' movements in America you probably won't find in many other places.Whatever you say about Bhagavan Das's ethics or writing ability probably isn't that relevant to the quality of the book itself."
3,Item was rather too extensively highlighted.,"I was surprised at the amount of yellow highlighting in the book. It was much more than ""some"" as advertised."
5,A true Spiritual Warrior,"From the moment I opened this book Bhagavan Das grabbed my attention and wheeled me in, taking me on a journey with him through the spiritual world. He is a man that never thought of the risks he would have to face in his quest to find God. The places that Bhagavan Das goes to and the people that he meets is truly amazing. He was a pioneer way beyond his time. I loved this book. This book should be a MUST read for anybody on the spiritual path. Any person that is into the yogic lifestyle and wants to know the down and dirty facts of the life of an American devotee on the path should read this book. Bhagavan Das is the MAN! He not only shares his quest for finding God he also shares his knowledge. He explains everything in easy to understand terms. God Bless the First American Yogi (Well at least in my eyes).Radhe Govinda!"
4,A tenacious celebration of devotion,"I recently bought this as a present to my son Sebastian, who is studying filmaking in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He just finished it and sent me the following blurb on this book:""Bhagavan Das's spiritual memoir is a tenacious celebration of devotion; the out-in-the-open and direct style of former Michael Riggs (renamed Bhagavan Das) makes of his life story a pulsating testament to the common ground of all creeds and to the power of genuine belief. Shooting through taboos, generations, cultures, and cults, Bhagavan Das's experiences demand introspection and self questioning, and serve as fine example for any who seeks spiritual integrity. Whether you are drawn to Buddha, Shiva, Jesus, or Mother Earth, to yogis, priests, musicians, poets, or shamans, ""It's Here Now (Are You?)"" is a relyable source of insight."""
3,Gump das careens around the 60's-90's spiritual circus.,"Nice guy, I can relate to the madness, fun reading but rough living it I would think. When you view the origional intelligence as a ""oneness"" that isn't self aware with it's fingers stirring the pot, it is easy to then think you should follow all those that give the advice that YOU are the it. I tried that but found that the best advice about being here now is to give a nod in the direction of this reccomendation--- love the origional intelligence, that is self aware and is NOT you. Love yourself, and love others. Something kids do easily. Don't focus on god so much, have fun shoveling snow like ram dass did for a few minutes and then just feel your breath and love it all. I do hope you make some big money on this effort. Why not!"
5,An incredible movie,"This movie was absolutely wonderful, I found myself almost crying, not because it was a sad movie (it wasn't) but because it has such a heartfelt story line. Very well crafted."
4,Surprise!!,"Great family movie. The story, the actors, the production, all did very well. Alfre Woodard is outstanding (as usual). I recommend this movie."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"This movie was very boring..there wasn't much of a plot..and it went nowhere. While I was watching it, I couldn't wait until it was over with."
3,"Sleepaway School, an autobiography","An OK read, Sleepaway School by Lee Stringer is the story of young Caverly Stringer. He has an anger problem that he himself can barely make sense of and gets sent to a sleepaway school for troubled boys. That basically sums up the story. Nothing too interesting goes on, and when there seems to be something juicy right around the corner the author offers only a peek or, at times, seems too embarassed to delve into the details. To his credit, Sleepaway School is not my type of read, though I stuck with it. I would recommend it as a filler when you're in between books. All around it's a quick, easy read."
3,Good idea,This is a good idea to start with. If you are an active person this my not be the right deoderent for you.
5,Great CD !,"The first time I touched their songs since I was 18 years old student,they always give us great music and a little amazing thing.In my opinion,they are the finest present-day ""White Soul"" sound.This collection is included all hit singles like ""Stars"",""For Your Babies"",""Say You Love Me"" and famous recover ,such as ""If You Dont Know Me By Now"" and other non-single songs.This ablum is divided into two parts:(1)Hold me (track1~track19)(2)Thrill me(track20~track37).I prefer the first part and I highly recommand ""You've Got It""."
1,I Want My Money Back,"I have read at least 20 books in the 33 1/3 series and this was definatley the worst one. I agree with the people who said its more about writer, Michelangelo, than about Prince. I think the Seth guy who wrote that other review got paid off by the writer to write what he did, because this book is not like a discussion about Prince with your best friend but about some guy I don't care about's life, and then a bunch of stuff about Prince that didn't make sense as if he didn't even listen to the album really. Dosen't matter though because I looked up the Seth guys writing and he's an even more horrible music writer than Michelangelo. Anyways, whatever, the point is there are lots of other better books in this series to spend your money on, this one was a waste of time and $$$."
1,What a Waste!,"I can't even give this 1 star, but since we're not allowed to give less...I remember very well the day i came across it in a book store quite by accident. I snatched it up so fast, my wife almost hit the floor trying to duck out of my way! Imagine my disappointment upon finding out it was basically one man's life story that surrounded the release of this album on cassette, when i actually thought (hoped?) it told the story of the MAKING of this landmark album, you know, how the songs developed, who was involved, what year he began the songs, etc. That would have been interesting. At least more interesting than the misconstrued lyrics the author wrote about.For the record, Prince does not sing ""Honey if you LET me, i just might do something rash..."" in ""Strange Relationship."" The lyric is ""Honey if you LEFT me..."" for those of you who learned the lyrics listening to the cassette."
5,If you miss the Jeremy Brett versions of Holmes . . . .,"We are huge fans of the Jeremy Brett series of Sherlock Holmes mysteries. The attention to the details of Doyle's stories and Paget drawings was phenomenal, and all the actors were wonderful in every respect. If you miss them, then ""Murder Rooms"" will help you carry on. Detail, respect, wonderful acting, elements presented which refer to inspiration for Doyle's stories: it's here. After watching ""Murder Rooms"" on TV, we had to add both DVDs to our Brett/Holmes DVD library. They've also got me going back and re-reading all the Doyle Holmes stories which were not presented in the Brett series just to round out my memory the world and characters Doyle created. Look for references to nearly exact conversations from the Brett/Holmes series, and also for the appearance of the dedicated butler from ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" in the ""White Knight Strategem."" A wonderful series---we hope they make MORE!"
4,Based on Fact!,"Dr Joseph Bell was a real person, and was a profound influence on the young Conan Doyle in medical school. Bell's approach to problem solving was by method of deductive reasoning. See the book ""Doctor Joe Bell: Model for Sherlock Holmes"" by Ely Liebow, Professor of English at Northeastern Illinois University. This fascinating book is available on Amazon, but is pricey as it was privately printed. Dr Liebow's personal page is at www.neiu.edu/~edepartm/dep/profs/liebow.htm."
2,Great pilot...Poor DVD...,"It is too bad that the same people who did the rest of the programme (Murder Rooms) didn't do the pilot for the show (Dr. Bell and Mr. Doyle). Why? Because they, at least, get the aspect ratio right. BFS doesn't seem to have (this is sad since the transfer looks pretty good). Murder Rooms was a wonderful programme and it deserves better than this (it almost looks like a 4:3/1:33:1 stretched a bit given the slim black bars at the top and bottom). For those of you with an all region DVD player cross your fingers that a British edition at a reasonable cost appears (in the correct aspect ratio) sometime in the near future."
2,Strangely Dull ...,"I've been looking forward to watch these features. And I was rather disapointed, even if the décor is superb, the acting fine and the mystery well written... The dialogues are boring, some scenes are meant to be funny, exciting or whatever - but you can see the machinery of the screenwriter - This whole series is just a weak 'ersatz' for the real stuff (Poirot, Holmes, Morse, ...)"
4,Technical beginning leads to a good story line.,"As was stated by someone else, Bob Lee Swagger is a former top class sniper from the military. One should be prepared to lots and lots of gun/rifle input for a good 100 pages before the real story begins at it's best. Since Bob Lee and his unusual side kick Nick Memphis seemingly fumble through the story, there is an enormous cast of characters to weed out the good from the bad, thus it's a bit confusing. However, the twist at the end is super, even though we suspect something big is coming, it's a doozie! Thus, I'll likely continue with the series and try to follow Bob Lee and characters for a bit longer. But if one is not a gun expert or lover, be prepared for a long beginning."
4,Good Sniper Book,"Better than the movie - in fact, little similarity to the movie. A really good read."
4,"Best book I've ever read? Not hardly, but pretty good!","I was amazed at the number of 5 star reviews. I hesitated even to review. But this is a good book. Overly long and plodding at times. The sequal is better. If you like Clancy you will like this, but keep your expectations moderate."
5,Different; exciting; I reread it every year.,"This is probably my favorite book. When someone wants to begin reading, I suggest this one first. I can't believe someone has not made a movie."
5,WOW,This is absolutely the best novel I've ever read! The plot is so thick and so capturing. You have to read it to believe it!
3,OK,"In my opinion i felt like the first half of the book contained to much back story and not enough action, but once the action starts it does carry the story very well.My only other criticism is that Bob the Nailer wasn't that interesting of a character. He didn't have any personal faults or things in his path that would have given him more depth.I read the book with intention of going to see the movie but after reading the book the only thing i would want to see the movie for is to see what they added to make the book more interesting.My personal favorite reocurring character in a book is Mitch Rapp who is a government operative that works in the middle east. I suggest you pick up one of his books if you would like non-stop action beginning to end and a character with a lot of depth."
1,Disappointed,"I read almost all of the reviews of this book and was very excited about reading it. I'm on page100 and so far NOTHING has happened. I've exhusted all authors I like such as Pollock, ludlum,land Cussler and Cornwell. I'm just glad I didn't buy more of Hunter. How can approx.50 people be right and 1 disappointed. I don't know. But I do know if you like action don't read or try to read this book."
1,Bob Lee Swagger a murderer???,"""Point of Impact"" is one of my favorite books and I have read all of Stephen Hunters earlier and later works. They are not all gems for those of you who haven't read them but they are pretty good.I have been waiting for this movie for years. In the late 1990's the project was supposed to star Tommy Lee Jones but that movie never got made. This movie is pretty faithful to the book with updating for modern times. However, the ending is out of left field and a terrible conclusion. Perhaps this is because through all of the other books about Bob Lee and his father, never once did I feel ashamed of their behavior as I did watching this ending. Shame on Stephen Hunter for allowing this to happen to his story."
1,LACKED IMPACT,I thought the book was very BLAH and BORING. The writing was cut rate to say the least. FLAT. Monotone. One dimensional. What characters? What action? What story?
5,Bob Lee Swagger - a man of honor,"I recommended this book to all my friends and they all have thanked me profusely after reading it. This is the best book I have ever read. Bob Lee Swagger captures perfectly my concept of true heroism, bravery and honor- the things that made America great. Read it- I guarantee you will scramble to read the sequel: Blacklight."
5,WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE IT A MOVIE?,"ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS THAT I HAVE EVER READ!!!! I HOPE THAT I DON'T GET ON THE CHARLIE LIST WITH THIS REVIEW!!!! STEPHER HUNTER HIT A ""BULL"" WITH THIS ONE."
5,The first book I read all the way through!,Stephen Hunter is the best author that I have ever read. His use of Bob Lee was gripping and thrilling. It's a must read!
5,it's even got dimensional characters,"We listened to the audio version on a road trip and it was enthralling. Great plot, great action, and real people who change because of the circumstances they're in. And the reader did a great job, too. If all of Stephen Hunter's books are this good, count me in as a fan."
4,Better than movie,'tis worth a read. Buy book. You will not be dissappointed. Ten more words of praise to get them to stop askin me to review this.
5,Point of Impact,"I read the hardcover book, and thought Stephen Hunter did a great job. The audio book was great. Better than the movie."
5,I felt like I lived in the world of Bob Lee Swagger WOW!,"One of the best books I've read in a long time.If ever there was an author that tops Clive Cussler, it has to be Stephen Hunter. He was able to take a fantastic plot and turn it into a plausible sequence of events. You were carried along with Bob Lee on every turn of the bend. The character was exquisitely brought to life. The assassination plot was a complete surprise and chillingly executed! With each turn of events, you breathlessly follow his next move. Point of Impact is a book for anyone who enjoys action-adventure. Written with a grace that is rare for any style of book, from the beautifully orchestrated way his characters come together to the exquisite detail that permeates throughout. Stephen Hunter has a new follower who looks forward to his next book like a surfer looks forward to his next big wave. Give us more Stephen!"
4,Bob swaggers,"For someone who doesn't have a background on rifles/guns, I found this book an interesting read. The variations & functions were concisely described without losing the reader into the technical & miniscule details. But this was just icing to the cake. The real serving was Bob the Nailer...his strength, his vulnerability, his unwavering faith to justice & the institution that embodies it. He is no cut-out hero but a 3-D character very much alive --- living & hurting --- dangerous but likeable.(This review pertains to Reader's Digest abrdiged version.)"
5,Fantastic read,Keeps you guessing what the heck is going to happen next. Can't put it down. He is a great writer.
5,Point of Impact,"This was a great read. It would go along and then Hunter would 'amp' it up to another level. Each time he did raise it up, the story never went back down. You just waited for the next jump. I have already ordered the next one."
4,Definitely makes an impact,"Hunter's Point of Impact is a flawlessly constructed thriller, filled with tension, cast with variety, and packed with a convincing amount of esoteric detail on rifle shooting. Bob Lee Swagger, a veteran sharpshooter with a Vietnam past, is seen to have fired on the American President at a New Orleans speech. Having escaped, hunted by the FBI and the nation's police forces, he must fight the shadowy paramilitary group that set him up. The pace never flags, the net of sub-plots prevents monotony from ever setting in, and it all reaches a truly astonishing finale. The hero's name is interestingly chosen: the imperturbable, unbreakable Swagger is both his name's very embodiment and its antithesis. The characterisation is otherwise black-and-white, but without clichés. And the book reads as a kind of survivalist gospel. Sociology students: take note.P.S. Don't read the two-page Swagger Family History inserted by the publisher at the beginning. It is full of spoilers."
5,Phenomenal,"There simply are not enough superlatives to describe Point of Impact. This was a phenomenal book, clearly among my personal top-five list. In Point of Impact, Hunter presents Bob Lee Swagger (AKA ""Bob the Nailer"" due to his reputation as a Marine sniper during the Vietnam War) in a fast-paced conspiracy thriller. Hunter hooks you in the first few pages of the book as Swagger is hunting on his property in Arkansas. As the story unfolds, Swagger demonstrates the physical and mental toughness, decisiveness, patience, perseverance, and survival instincts that made him the best at what he does. Throughout the book, one comes to know and further appreciate the intricacies, both positive and negative, of being ""Bob the Nailer."" Action sequences and character development are interwoven and provide a complementary blend throughout the book. From start to finish, this book is impossible to put down."
5,Couldn't put it down,"It's like a Lee Child novel, only different. It's about a good person against impossible odds with MacGyver skills who prevails to win. Though you know Swagger will live to see another novel, you haven't a clue how until the very end of the book. The only bad thing is it's the kind of book that reads so fast it's over before you know it."
5,"See the movie, but read the book",Like the movie version of this book - Shooter with Mark Wahlberg - but decided to read the book as well. Glad I did since the book offers a richer and more detailed plot. Have done some shooting in my time so I quite enjoy the details about guns and marksmanship. Bob Lee Swagger is a great character much like Jack Reacher. A good read.
5,"From the intro. to the last page,non-stop action!","From the time when Bob Lee Swagger meets RamDyne,to the heart stopping end,you will be on the edge of your seat with every turn of the page!If you are just starting you first Stephen Hunter novel,this is the one to begin with."
4,"A gripping, involving, page-turner of a thriller.","Not the sort of book I usually read, but I was acting on a friend's recommendation. I'm glad I did! This was a very enjoyable book, filled with careful attention to detail and a great, climactic turn of events. Bob Lee Swagger is a memorable fictional creation and interesting enough that I may just have to go on to read his other adventures (_Black Light_ and _Time to Hunt_). Give the book a try!"
2,Great for gun nuts..... but highly implausible,"I love firearms, which is why I am trying Hunter's novels. I read Hot Springs and learned all about Bob Lee's pappy, Earl. He was a very unlikeable character, a grim, efficient killer with serious psychological, social and alcohol problems.Like father, like son - Bob Lee is perhaps the deadliest shot on the planet, but he isn't someone I can even remotely empathize with.When I read a novel, I sometimes find I can't put it down. With Point of Impact, I set it aside for nearly a week, and finally picked it back up just to see how it ended. I enjoyed the (mostly) accurate firearms details, but the plot is a joke. The only reason I gave the book two stars instead of one is that Hunter is a gun nut and obviously loves rifles. I think he needs to learn how to set up a half way believable plot."
2,Book cover not as advertised,"This book is a fantastic read, I know this because I read it recently on holiday. I ordered another book because I managed to get suncream on it(the book isn't mine) so upon researching another I found that some books had a different front cover. I chose this one because I wanted an exact replacement and it has the same cover advertised. I was sadly disappointed when I received the book with a different cover. hey ho."
2,"Variable machine, variable quality","RCA perhaps indicates its opinion of their machine in that the RTD255 does not exist on their website -- no manuals, no information about it.The sound and DVD quality are quite good, when it works. It usually works.But occasionally when loading or unloading the mechnical apparatus just stops working. Mysteriously, if I cycle the power off and on, it sometimes starts working again. It is also -- as other reviewers have noted -- Very Slow at loading CDs and DVDs; and the MP3 picture viewing is so slow as to be worthless.The remote control is strangely designed; certain source types are not available on the remote."
2,great but smelly,Great price but when i got mine it almost killed me and my girlfriend .. we drove for 15 mins then the smell of the rubber was horrendous
1,NOT as expected,the picture shows seat beat accessories that is why i bought this product but ending up not having it not even one..
5,A cute auto accessory,I'm a Disney nut and when I saw this adorable steering wheel cover I had to have it.
2,Upside down design,"Looks nice, however all the three characters are placed facing the same way. Therefore when placing in a centered steering wheel, (each character at 10, 2 and 6 o'clock) at least one of them (10 or 2 o'clock) will be placed upside down.Returning..."
5,I bought this as a gift,We purchased this as a Christmas gift for our Daughter in Law. I came promptly and was well packed. Overall we are very pleased.
4,Another Great Recording from the BBC Vaults!,"A great session featuring the ""big four"" Soft Machine lineup of Ratledge, Hopper, Dean & Wyatt. Guests include Wyatt's soon-to-be replacement, Phil Howard, and British jazz great Ronnie Scott. Sound quality is superb. A must for Soft Machine and jazz-rock fans."
2,less than average Celtic tale.....,"This was my first book by this author.This books premise-a King who must follow ancient tradition and bed each new bride on their wedding night-is a hard storyline to do tastefully. This book just glossed over the act of the hero meeting then bedding the heroine,who is pretty much being forced into either submitting to the tradition, or being cast out by her family and made a servant. This is not what makes for an enjoyable story to me and I just quit in disgust.Not recommended-2 stars."
3,Pretty good sock,High quality socks are as important as high quality shoes. My wigwams have lasted for about 4 years (I wear them in the winter) and I'm hoping for similar high quality with these Thorlos. Very comfy but don't seem to be as snug after being washed.
1,Boring...,"I purchased this movie on the fact that some of the reviews were fairly positive about it. Well, I don't know what those people were thinking, but this is a very bad movie. It is boring, has nothing to tell, poorly made even by the standards of the time it was made in. Sorry. Waste of money."
1,not even close,"I bought this DVD based upon the enthusiastic review that was popular for this film. I'm going to make my review short. There are no special creatures in this film, the women are covered 99% of the time, and there is no dialogue whatsoever. The film you want in this genre, available here on Amazon dot com is, ""Dinosaur Valley Girls"" the DVD ""$24.95 new"" version that has the blonde in the foreground, and an open mouthed green dinosaur behind her. This film, ""Creatures the World Forgot"" is aptly named, forget about it."
4,An interesting mix.,"This is a ""leftovers"" record. While it is a compliation of things that didn't make it to their other records, it isn't a second-rate offering. Highlights inclued ""Hacksaw Hip Hooray"" ""Cheaters"" and the sprawling mini rock opera ""Pilot County Suite."" If you're already a fan, get this one quick. If you're not yet a fan try out ""Tell the Kids the Cops are Here"" first, then check this one out."
3,KINO Edition only mediocre at best!,"As much as I have praised and adored KINO on previous releases of other classic films, this time I must say they have failed to live up to their usual standards.This supposed ""restored"" edition is only marginally better than most public domain copies available. The opening titles, as mentioned in a previous review, reveals this to be a later print taken from an Astor Pictures re-release of the film sometime in the forties. The sound doesn't appear to be a huge improvement over other copies I own.All in all, I suppose it doesn't hurt to have one more edition of this fantastic film; but couldn't KINO have waited for a more definitive edition instead of giving us this fake restoration editon?"
1,Legend strikes out,"One of these days, a Region 1 DVD distributor will get it right and issue a fully complete, good-quality edition of this movie. Because of its public domain status in the U.S., plenty of editions are in circulation. Yet each one is lacking in one way or another. Even the ""restored"" Kino version is a disappointment. I had high hopes for this Legend edition (and not because of the colorization), but it turns out this is an edited version, which makes it utterly useless to me. I'm not even particularly fond of this film; I've always considered it one of the team's lesser efforts. But I'm a completist, so it's a must for my collection. The wait for the definitive DVD release continues..."
3,Why does Amazon lump reviews together for different disc manufacturers?,"If you are looking for a version of Flying Deuces and only read so far down the reviews, you think this is either the best version available or the worst image of a movie ever released to DVD. For the record Kino is excelent picture quality in detail, has a re-issue title and has a print that, while sharp, shows its age. Stonevision is the best source material available, but does not show well on a large projection screen due to its compression ratio. Legend is nice, but edited in both the color versions and the B&W version (which they say will be corrected). Madacy - RIP. Not everyone reads the entire review, and while I think Amazon is the best to buy from with selection, service, and return policy, they need to attach the reviews to the product they are reviewing."
3,KINO On Video DVD is the best,"This movie was produced outside of Laurel & Hardy's regular studio and is not quite up to par with their classics.The KINO On Video DVD is the best around, it is sharp and clear from 35mm. Their version also includes the BEST copy of ""A Tree In A Test Tube""."
2,Not as I remembered,"1st, the picture is terrible. There were many times when I could barely make out the faces of Laurel and Hardy. I have several other Laurel and Hardy films, and this is by far the worst in this regard. It is nearly unwatchable--certainly less than I would expect of a ""remastered"" film. 2nd, I seem to remember an entire sequence from when I originaly saw this movie many, many years ago that is not part of this cut. It was that sequence that I remember thinking was the funniest when I was a boy, so I would not recommend this product."
5,Funniness in the French Foreign Legion!,"This is an excellent Laurel & Hardy movie, even though some of the later ones are not. The Flying Deuces has a solid story, even though of course the story is still filled with some surreal and comical moments. Laurel and Hardy manage to fall in love with a married inn-keeper's daughter, get recruited into the French Foreign Legion, disrupt and get kicked out of the Legion, and end up in a ridiculously hilarious predicament that makes you understand why Laurel & Hardy are such classic comedic figures. Also, the ending escape sequence is so great and is my favorite part of the movie.Truly a L&H; Must-See!"
2,NOT ONE OF THEIR GREATEST,"I was quite disappointed when I first viewed this film.Inspite of the impressive openning and closing credits,where L&H are seen in cartoon form,Oliver's beautiful musical number of""Shine On Harvest Moon"",and the climactic airplane scene,the film is not one of their funniest.I personally find the film somewhat depressing somehow.Definetly not one of their better films."
2,Two Laughs is Not Enough,"I tried so hard to love this movie, but in all honesty, I thought it was painfully unfunny. I laughed twice - first when Ollie tells Stan that without him ""people would stare at you and wonder what you are - and I wouldn't be here to tell them"" and last at the very end when Ollie is reincarnated as a horse with a mustache and a hat. To be fair, I admit that I also smiled once to see Ollie's coy flirtation with the innkeeper's daughter.Apart from that, the film was only interesting for its surprising bleakness at the beginning - there was something compelling about watching Ollie, suicidally depressed, decide that Stan too must die.All in all, I was bored. The boys try hard to be funny but the material just isn't up to it. Two laughs is not enough."
3,Good stuff from the boys,"Actually, I would rate this as a 4 star film, but I'm yet to find a copy of it without some major flaws in the print quality. So I figure, if you take a 4 star film, with 2 star picture quality, you get a 3 star film.This is probably the only non Hal Roach film that L&H did that comes close to the standards they set so many years earlier. Actually, this film is better than some of the weaker Roach efforts. (Swiss Miss comes to mind) It's fast paced, has a good staple of classic L&H supporting actors, and is sure to be lots of fun if you're a fan of the boys."
2,KINO version is the best available.,"Let's set the record straight. This version from KINO is from a 35mm positive release print of the Astor re-issue. It does NOT have opening titles from a 16mm print as some people have stated. The entire print is from a 35mm transfer. Some folks have been spoiled with computer ""restoration"" which is a joke. I do have one complaint. The transfer is done at a speed of 1.4 which is about 26 frames per second. This does not affect the film, but it does affect the running time. Deuces runs 69 minutes, however the KINO version is only 65 minutes. Why would they do that?"
2,Disappointed,"They say if you give a man a fish he'll eat for a day. This book let's you eat for a day. If you're just looking to copy and paste without any real understanding of what you're doing, you may get something out of this book. If you want to be able to write ASP on your own, you won't like this book. I would suggest ""Sams Teach Yourself Active Server Pages 3.0 in 21 Days"", an excellent resource. Also, checkout msdn.microsoft.com."
5,Best Dora as judged by how much my kids love to watch this,"We have owned this DVD for a few months now, and having owned many Dora DVDs too, I can easily say this is the one that my kids love to watch the most. The watch it over and over again, far more than any other of the Dora's titles.The Egg Hunt episode is extremely well done, as Dora, Boots and the whole gang go and look for Easter Eggs and find beautiful Egss that are filled with toys and surprises. You would even get Swiper dressed as an Easter bunny to try to get it's hands on the eggs.The other episodes on the DVD are lovely too, with Pablo's flute being a nice tribute to South American flute traditional songs.If you are a spanish speaker, the DVD come with a Spanish track in which Dora and their friends speak spanish and teach lessons of basic english. This version here is region 1, but you can find a Region 4 version at many retailers in Latin America.A great DVD for your little kids (especially liked by those 2-4 yrs old)."
3,Disappointed,"I have a three yr old daughter who is addicted to Dora, and has all of the tapes and dvd's. We sit patiently waiting for the new ones to come out. I was excited for this one to come out, even though the TV had played Egg Hunt over and over. I was very disappointed to see the two extra episodes were repeats! The two on there, Pablos flute and La Musico have already been released on tapes. So, just keep that in mind, you really arent getting extra episodes, my daughter does not watch this one anymore. Bummer! We keep waiting!!"
5,Dora the Explorer~The Egg Hunt,So far my grand daughter hasn't watched this all the way through. It doesn't seem to hold her interest.
5,Excellent choice,This in conjunction with the outdoor directional antenna brought my small home from 1 bar to 5 bars.
1,Really Bad,"I have bought this with the hopes of getting to use are cells in the front room. This was only about 10/20 feet away from the base. 1st the cable is so short you have to put it next to the main box. Not a big deal. I went from in the back of my house where the main base is. 3/5 bars to 0 bars, and could not use our cell phones. I put the old antenna back on and work. Going to try one more Antenna and it does not work. I will go with to main base units to the same outside antennas (somehow I feel that is going to happen anyway.)."
4,Confused in IL.,"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who thought the instructions are as clear as mud. I did finally figure out where the ""beam of light"" was...but still haven't figured out how you get to the gift. Do you go thru the princess starting point? Is the blue stone in front of it a space, is that how you get to the gift at three stone space? HEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLPPP!!!!! What do the castles on the corners have to do with it, is that the gate? &*$#&^@*&#^*Talk about a kids game that will make you feel like an idiot!"
1,PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"My daughter (5 years old) received this game for her birthday. The game looks cute...but the instructions can be complicated and confusing. The spinning wheel is not sturdy, and when you spin it, it comes off the base (Disney should have put a center pin on the wheel to keep the spinner on it's base)....By the time you assemble all of the pieces and place everything on the board, there is hardly any room to roll the dice onto the board! There is also a good chance that one player will only hit the spaces where they lose a turn. My daughter had it happen 5 TIMES IN A ROW (she and I finally got frustrated and put the game away). Please save your money, skip this game, and look for something else."
2,Overly complicated,"Cons:Game is overly complicated. Directions are not clear. I would describe the rules here, but i still haven't figured them out. I have played the game twice so far with my 4 year old daughter, and it was better for us to make up our own rules along the way versus following the actual game rules.Pros:My daughter is a Princess fanatic, and this is afterall a princess game. The pieces seem to be sturdy, and the game itself is colorful and pleasing to the eye. My daughter doesn't seem to mind that we play the game not according to the original rules - she likes spinning the wheel and collecting the gifts.So.. despite it being the worse game I've ever seen, my daughter does seems to like it, and isn't that what its all about? so its tough for me to give it just one star - hence, the two star rating. Its just too bad; i wish the game maker could have made the game simpler to play."
1,Not worth the money,"This game seemed like a terrific idea for my 5 year old daughter. She is absolutely crazy about the Disney Princesses. However, this game was not fun. It was infuriatingly slow for adults, and confusing for children. It was a waist of money and the time spent playing it."
2,Seriously frustrating!,"My daughter likes it, but only because she has an unusually high level of patience. Her friends refuse to play it after they tried unsuccesfullly to finish a game. 30 minutes into it and they were nowhere near even the middle of the game and that was with a set of friends who are quiet and calm. I would never pull this game out for some of her other more rambunctious friends.Please DO NOT by this game!"
1,Am returning this game,"We bought this game for our 5 year old daughter and will be returning it tomorrow. the directions are confusing - we can't even figure out how to play it. (and I have an MBA and he's an engineer)!!We think we figured it out, but arent' sure. not fun at all."
4,Spinning Wishes,"This game is great. I work with preschoolers as a speech pathologist, and for kids close to or over age 5, it's fun to play. Even the boys enjoy it. I think the people who are looking for some kind of educational value to this game have their expectations set a little too high--this is just for fun! The most difficult part is the spinner, as it does fly off the board, but not really a big deal. Once the kids figure out how to move it, it hardly occurs. Just touch it gently on the side; trying to put your fingers in the holes designated for the objects doesn't work too well. Overall, it's a fun game for the current princess craze, and my preschoolers love it."
2,You'll wish for a better game,"This is a cute concept but poorly designed. The instructions are confusing; we have to wing it on a few of the rules. The game board and spinner are flimsy. And the ""wishes"" consist of things like makeup, mirrors, and engagement rings, gag. There are plenty of better family games out there -- Cranium games, for example, are very reliable, fun, and well designed."
2,Somewhat confusing.....,"My 3 yr old daughter recently received this game. I have to admit that the instructions confused me for a few minutes. I had to play it to understand completely. I also needed to provide my daughter with lots of direction in order to play. It's not as simplistic as for example: Pretty, Pretty Princess. The spinner is made up of a thin plastic which is not sturdy. It also comes in 2 pieces (one sitting on top of the other) and frequently comes apart when spun. I can't recommend this game and would advise my friends to purchase pretty, pretty princess instead..."
3,Princesses are its only redeeming value!,"What a disappointment! Obviously I bought this game because my 4-year-old daughter loves the Disney Princesses. To be honest, my daughter likes the game well enough, but my guess is that if didn't have the princesses on it, the game would never come out of the closet. The gameplay itself is uninteresting, and there is absolutely no educational value to speak of. It is more fun when there are more than 2 players. We have the same problem as the other reviewers who complained about the plastic spinner--very difficult to spin. If you're looking for a game that you will enjoy playing with your children, this is not it!"
2,Nuvo flush mount closet light,"I purchased this light for the closets in our new house as the code laws say closet lights have to hold only a cfl bulb. First, these are beautiful lights and for $20 the price was right. However, I wanted a fixture with 2 bulbs so the closets can be nice and bright and that's what the details on this product say...that it takes 2 cfl bulbs that are included with the light. The bulb is included but this fixture only takes 1 bulb. So, this is a fine light fixture and it will look beautiful in our closets, however, if you're like me and looking for a fixture with 2 light bulbs, pass on this one. 5 stars for the product, 1 star for the poor description."
1,Don't bother - get the Warner Home Video version!,"This is a Public Domain film - anyone can download it from, say, Archive.org. It's been available for in while in really awful quality. Recently, Warner Home Video did a great job with this film, cleaned it up and THAT is the version to get - not from any one of dozens of no-name companies. Warner Home Video. That's all there is to it. This version on this page? Osiris Entertainment? Look, the big picture you see of Sinatra is a tip off. Sinatra appears at the end of the film. For a few minutes. The cover artwork has you thinking he's the star and that he was the Capitol Records ""cool"" Sinatra. Nope. In this fim, he's still the skinny curly-haired teen idol. One last time: Warner Home Video is the official cleaned up DVD version you're looking for.Till the Clouds Roll By (Remastered Edition)Thus endeth the sermon."
4,Good review of Wilson Extreme Synthetic Gut 17G,Nice sound off the racquet. Good control and good value for a recreational player like myself.
5,memories...,"This recipe book was actually written by one of my distant cousins, so it pleases me to no end to see how well-loved it is. It's truly a wonderful recipe book, lovingly written with fun illustrations that I've enjoyed since childhood. The recipes are classic, easy to follow, and definitely authentic.It's out of print, so if you can get your hands on it at a good price... do it!"
2,Bummer,I was looking forward to giving these DVDs to my granddaughter for her birthday. The entire box was damaged in shipping. I returned it to Amazon without any problems and ordered something else.
5,AWESOME....arrived very fast,"It was a Christmas gift and they loved it. This is very hard to find in the stores where I live, so I was happy to find it here!!"
2,Same episodes as other collections,"It contains 3~4 episodes I own on other DVD's. When you try to collect a series that ran for 10 yrs years or it should ONLY be compiled by COMPLETE SEASONS. These should each contain ALL that seasons episodes arranged in the order that they ran the first time. Why should we pay for multiple copies of discs with the same episodes on them. Gunsmoke and The Big Valley copyright holders are doing the same thing. Directors favorites sets suck as do ""Classic Westerns"" sets with several different shows or movies on the same discs within a boxed set. ALL the John Wayne movie ""boxed sets"" are like that too."
1,Wrong Theme Song,"If having the correct Bonanza theme music is important to your enjoyment of the episodes, don't buy this. The theme is replaced by different music. I've read elsewhere that the rights to the music and the episodes are separate, so cheap versions have replacement music. This is one such cheap version."
1,I agree: get the German Season One version...,"...I have it and it's great! The original music, etc. Of course, there is an English option so it is just like watching an American version (except there is no American Season One!).The menu, though in German, is easy to navigate. Of course, all the sound, etc, is in the original English if you choose the English option.Just saw episode one: classic! Just wonderful."
1,Didn't buy this,"Thank you for providing the info. I spent 10 minutes trying to figure out what episodes were included....you are correct, just a rehash of previously released. Would also love to get more episodes. Maybe someday."
1,Doesn't work!,"We've used this product for 2 weeks now on our puppy ~ twice a day. They say to wipe it on and wipe stains away. Doesn't happen, didn't change anything at all. The one star rating shouldn't be there, but this can't be submitted without it."
1,Irritates dog's eye,"I just rescued a chihuahua mix and although she's in excellent health I wasn't too thrilled about her tearstains. I did a little research online about the issue and after trying some home remedies (warm water, vaseline, etc) with no success I picked this up at my local pet food store. My poor pup is already hesitant to let me work on her eyes, but when I tried to use this product she actually seemed to be in pain. Her eye looks to be a little red and bloodshot now. I will ask my vet for a better recommendation this week and will not use this product again."
1,Does not work at all,"I used this on my shih-tzu's face every day until it was gone, and it made absolutely NO difference whatsoever. Save your money, this stuff is worthless."
2,"Nice product, terrible quality control.","I ordered 3 of these pads and they are all cut incorrectly, making the lines hang off the top of the pad and rendering the title boxes at the top unusable. These title / notation boxes are critical for an engineering application to aid in organization. Not to mention the pads just look poor with the alignment off by almost .5"".The paper itself is very nice, and wears well even through a lot of erasures and refiguring. The binding is much thicker than ampad or national pads which keeps the pages on the pad until you want them off.This pad performs very well, and it is unfortunate that the poor quality control makes it unpresentable and therefor relegates it to scratch pad use."
5,Mommy I am fat,This book helps you discover how your kids feel if they are overweight and how to realize that they do not need to lose weight but to maintain their weight and that YOU are not responsible for how much they eat. It is their responsibility.
2,"dragon shard is ""okay...""","cinamatics are good, game was not well plotted or did not have good storyline. game was too easy to beat on normal settings and was shortlived, i think they sunk too much resources into online play.beat it in 2 days or 1 weekend (not constant either, i do have a life). game ended leaving the feeling, ""that's it?!"" Wow, that was quick."
2,Man oh man was I dissapointed,"I usually dont write reviews (just too lazy) but I feel that I am almost morally required to write one for this game. I had high hopes after reading a couple other reviews on amazon.. and after some critiques of the game said that it was ""a nice blend of RTS and RPG""There are a lot of bugs in this game.. One of which I found out the hard way in the single person game that because I had too throughly destroyed the enemy (the game assumed I would not be able to destroy the enemy base .. which I demolished) and It would not let me win... therefore I had to start over and not recieve as much experience for.Ill give credit to the graphics... the game is pretty. However if you decide to create a full army, have all the upgrades and wait till you have all your soldiers watch as even a particullarly fast computer bogs down to a murky halt where your butt is still getting kicked by the enemy and you cannot use your special effects."
2,Disappointing,"Just got this game, installed it, downloaded the patch, and began play. Here is my quick review:Pros1. It's fun when it works.2. Graphics are kind of cool.3. Using above ground for RTS and underground for RPG is a unique idea.Cons1. Three factions and two very short campaigns (which use only two factions. the third is usable only in skirmish or multiplayer)2. Even after the update there are too many crashes. Lots of threads about it in the forums on the company website.3. Not enough character races, creatures, upgrades, etc. The way the population limit works kind of sucks.4. You get premade champions and you don't get to create your own (so much for the RPG aspect of the game).5. Gold through dungeoneering and taxation is interesting, but you have to wait...and wait...and wait for gold from taxes once you've gotten all the gold from the dungeons.If you really want this game, don't spend more than $20 on this game."
1,Absolute Crap,Atari should be sued for putting the Dungeons and Dragons name on this product. If you want a roleplaying game look elsewhere. If you are tired of Warcraft 3 this is not the game to replace it.
1,Broken and Unplayable,"I could write a long review if I could actually play this game. After installing the game without the patch, I could play for about a minute before the game crashed my system. I installed the patch. The game still crashes my system. No new patch in site. This is not a game, it is an unplayable mess that should be recalled or apologized for.Stay away."
2,Not impressed,"Played very slow, did not like the graphics. I had a hard time with controls, not very intuitive. Liked the intro."
4,great game wish it were longer,this game is great fun for those who are used to games like starcraft and warcraft. storyline and graphics are decent. controls are easy to handle. only real problem is they allow you to play 2 races and each race has 7 levels and thats it. the game is a good game though worth atleast 20 which makes it a perfect game to pass the time with
3,"Great game, but...","I love the game and the gameplay, but I haven't been able to get it running on all computers.I had purchased 2 copies of this game and installed 1 on my computer and 1 on my son's computer.It won't work on my son's computer at all.But other than that... It's a great game. :)"
2,Not worth the money,"This game has no similarity at all to D&D; and I found the title to the game misleading.Hero development is mundane and sorely limited.If you are looking for a D&D; game, this is definitely not it.Game is pretty repetive and limited."
3,Need a high powered computer,"Since RPG and RTS games are few and far between (especially non-Japanese because I HATE ""anything Pokemon"" ), I picked this one up. I loved it...until an epic battle came along. Then, the game would totally shut down! I have a PIII 1.5 processor and it wasnt powerful enough for this game. MAKE SURE your computer meets the requirements before you buy this game !!!"
1,Not that fun.,"Poor graphics, long load times... an Age of Empire's knock off with poor graphics. All your characters look the same.Not very fun or impressive. Save yourself some frustration and get a NEWER game :)Grade: F-"
1,This Game [...],"I bought this game because of all the hype and because I am a big d@D/ eberron fan but i feel ript off by this game [...] The game has multiple flaws, Graphics continue to go out aloot in this game and as a straagy game it is the weakest yet, It does have good graphics when it doesn't glitch out on you and the some of the character concepts are cool but that doesn't compare to the hight price tag, wait for this to go down to a $1.00 or if some on just gives it to you,Point Blank THIS GAME IS LAME,LAME,LAME!"
2,"Aweful game, a mix of the worst things from several genre.","This game takes some of the things we hate from most RTS games, all of the things we hate from DND hack and slash games, and piles them up into one product. Then if that wasn't enough, they throw in some of the most obnoxious micromanagement ever concieved.. Can you imagine having to control all of your resource farmers every second of a game? Imagine no more, you have to in this game!This one is best totally avoided, it is a poor production overall, does nothing new and innovative, and rips off a ton of ideas from other games - usually bad ideas."
1,FROZEN IN TIME,"Game is frozen most of the time. You get maybe 5 minutes of playtime per hour, the rest is spent waiting for game to unfreeze."
2,Between regular and bad.,"If you liked Warcraft III you may like this game. The game has a good engine, good sounds, good cinematic and characters are detailed, but that is all.If the makers would had put some cool effects when using a spell or an ability, the game would be better. Buildings and fortress are a joke. Gameplay is all about units quantities, didn,t see much strategy in this game. The ending of the campaign was very disappointing.This game could have been great, but it isn't.In conclusion, i would recommend to try a demo before buying this game. I didn't like it, so i won't recommend it. Try something like Battle for Middle Earth instead."
3,Not what I expected,"As a fan of strategy and RPG games, I was very sad to find out how this game actually works.In great Strategy RPG games like ""Age of Wonders"", ""Lords of Everquest"", ""Lords of Magic"", ""Ogre Battle"", ""Final Fantasy Tactics"", ""Fire Emblem"" and ""Tzar"" you have your units, resources, and heroes. The heroes (and units in some cases) gain xp and become very important parts of your battles and strategies.In this game you have units, resources, and heroes, but THE HEROES CANNOT GO UP IN LEVEL. You have ""Generals"" who are regular units who can go up in level when you pay experience and gold (capped at level 5)The quests are great IMHO, although a little bit too simple Kill this or kill that, lower the drawbridge...by (you guessed it) killing something else.I guess it is a good game, it's just such a huge downer to have heroes that can't level up in this day and age. (weeeeeeeak!)"
3,A lot like Warcraft III,"This is an obvious Warcraft III clone. It has a few pieces of frosting to grant it unique elements, but it's nothing you've never seen before. That doesn't necessarily make it bad, however. If you're looking for a D&D based RTS, then this is a winner. If you're just looking for a generic RTS, then there are better options out there."
3,A step above average - but only a step,"I don't have really strong feelings either way on God Stalk, not that it's bad. Three and a half stars is a more fitting rating, but it's not quite four star material. It was entertaining enough to keep me turning pages, but I was thinking about the next book in the ""to read"" pile while flying through. The world is richly textured - with the religions, politics and subterfuges being both well done and central to a meandering plot. I have a fondness for fantasy cities and Tai-Tastigon is a real winner. The harrowing beginning, with protagonist Jame running for her life, also hooked me. This is a step above typical fantasy, moderately darker in content (many of the characters are thieves) and has some legitimately funny bits as well. However, it was not quite the mind blowing experience a friend sold to me. It reminds me a little of the Liavek series but better, if that helps."
5,A must read for any serious reader of fantasy,"The book is simply delightful. P.C. Hodgell's wonderfully believable characters in a wonderfully believable world create a depth of reality rarely matched. Can be read as a swift read on a rainy Sunday afternoon (but much will be missed) or can be slowly consumed to ensure no nuance is lost. Do the latter, this book deserves it."
2,Please !,"Ok. So this book gets all EXCELLENT reviews from everyone who reviews in and not ONE of this people mentions that this stuff is PURE FICTION ? Think about it, people. If you think it's true then you're really ""on the edge"".The book does have some entertainment value, with Hillary Clinton described as a 'mind control master' for example. It's fun to picture some of the celebrities mentioned (such as Al Gore) in their Satanic robes. Two stars."
5,more then a interesting book,this book uncovers secrets. things that the public is not supose to know. this book is no good to anyone if it is read as entertainment or as information. this book must be more then another conspricay. the infomation in this book has to be spread. In no way should it be done to give priase to the aouther but to Jesus Christ.
1,Boring,"A look into the lives of the very wealthy. However, very few chapters are footnoted or sourced. The few that are use works that can hardly be considered worthy of more than the trash heap."
1,NOT RECEIVED,Amazon Help....I CANNOT GIVE A REVIEW AS I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE BOOK YET!!!! WHERE IS IT? 34 DAYS AND NOT DELIEVERED IS TOO LONG.
5,A Queer Ethnic Consciousness,"Queer Race is a sophisticated, powerful book that explores the sexual/racial perspective overlooked in contemporary queer theory. Dr. Ian Barnard examines crucial moments in popular culture; in doing so, his chapters on Jeffrey Dahmer and Gloria Anzaldua are remarkable. His keen diction and compelling style are aesthetically refreshing. Queer Race is a must read for anyone who desires a racial/queer analysis of our homogenized society."
4,Pleasurable and Sophisticated Reading.,"This book is a great tool for people who like to read just to enhance their vocabulary. It contains several short stories written with a somewhat different style from each other and the stories are a rich collection of sophisticated words. Some keywords have a description just like in a dictionary, so one can learn the meaning of those keywords by reading their description as well as its context in the story. There are also exercises that use the keywords, which help the reader retain the keywords in his/her mind. I wonder why Amazon doesn't have the whole collection of this book available."
2,Hard to watch,"I'm a high school AP English teacher, and I bought both the Peter Wood and Sidney Lumet versions of Long Day's Journey into Night, and while Lumet's version isn't totally satisfying, I find it far superior to Wood's version. I'm amazed, in fact, that anyone would recommend this version. Olivier is very good as James Tyrone, but the other actors give weak performances, and the camerawork lacks any creativity. Katharine Hepburn and Jason Robards are excellent in the Lumet version, and there are numerous interesting staging and cinematic choices."
2,Long Days Journey Review,"Long Days Journey Into Night was the classic struggle about man battling with his fate. I thought the movie was alright, but not really my kind of flick. For drama lovers it would probably be a little better. It lacked any real action or entertainment from my point of view, but kept my interest somewhat. The acting was very good, however the plot was very depressing and sad, it's not a very uplifting movie whatsoever."
4,Instructional Package,"I don't yet have this, so I'm not writing a review. But there's no information on just what this is, here or online, so I wanted to provide some. I finally found a post on a message board that describes it thusly: Lynne Jessup's ""Mandinka Balafon"" is an instructional package (book and 2 audiotapes) for learning to play the balafon.If you click on ""New Sellers"" one of them says it's a reprinting that comes with CDs.I hope to order this, when I have the money to afford it. If I do, I'll remove this and post an actual review with a lot more information."
4,Where are the animals?,"I looked at the table of contents and the index for this book. I am baffled as how a serious discussion of bioethics could omit testing on animals. Are Christians not obliged to help those who suffer but cannot speak?Because I have not read the book, however, I have given it four stars so I wouldn't throw off the ratings from where they stand. I'm just disappointed that that the author, who's writing as a Christian, would ignore such a large group of vulnerable beings."
2,This book truly is for dummies,"simple concepts that can easily be derived from a user's intuitiveness are broken down into ""concepts"" in this book. i can literally learn the first 200 pages of this book in 10 minutes by installing the SuSE Linux software myself.A little too beginnerish IMO. if you know the slightest bit about Linux, go for more advanced material."
2,"Disappointing, Immature and Underdeveloped","I was looking for another Star Trek book series to get into - and stumbled across SCE after reading references to the Starfleet Corps of Engineers (the Corps itself, not the book series) in other novels.However, upon reading these stories, I was highly disappointed. I appreciated the ideas, but the stories themselves (they are much too short and simplistic to even be called novellas) left much to be desired in the way of character and plot development. It was as if each author started out with a grand idea and then their spouse called them in for dinner - so they quickly solved the problem with a hectic and quick climax, and then abruptly ended the plot.Try Star Trek: Vanguard instead (if you like action, adventure, complex but still understandable and interesting plot lines, intriguing characters, and explorations of morality and science)."
4,Rousing Good Star Trek,"This was a fun Star Trek book. I enjoyed reading it very much. Good character building, interesting plot. It was a very enjoyable read. After several book series that have left me cold (and yearning for new S.T. books), it's refreshing to read something decent. I'm really looking forward to the next book in the series. It wasn't deep, it wasn't revolutionary, but it was enjoyable."
2,"Great idea, bad implementation","I loved the idea of a book about the Starfleet Corps of Engineers from the start. But I didn't find the stories engaging. Written as an anthology with a continuing cast and a common history there is a nice try at developing characters as the stories go along, but I didn't find the characters paricularly striking or original.What really irritated me was that when I finally started to get into a story, the last one, 'Interphase', about attempting to recover the Defiant from the TOS episode the Tholian Web it suddenly stopped (with a cliff hanger) and says it will be continued in the NEXT volume. I'd like to see how it turns out but I wasn't impressed enough by the other stories in this volume to buy another."
1,A very bad first-person shooter,"This game is strictly a VERY poor arcade shooter. You are placed in a helicopter or HUMVEE -- which is 100% controlled by an AI pilot or driver -- in Iraq behind a mini-gun or heavy machinegun, and you shoot at hundreds of out-in-the-open terrorists. That's it: wherever the helicopter goes, you go; with infinite ammo and the enemy standing out in the open shooting at you while you shoot at him. This gets very, very boring within 60 seconds of game play."
3,Kung Fluff,"I was thrilled to see the new release of the Shaw Brothers martial arts films on DVD. I remember sitting in front of the TV every Saturday in the '70's and '80's watching Kung Fu movies. And Shaw Brothers films were always the best.Having said this, My Young Auntie was a waste of film. There are a few good fights, but the attempts at comedy totally bog the film down. Perhaps to an Asian audience this film is hilarious. Jackie Chan, in an interview about the Rush Hour movies, stated that he really doesn't understand American humor. Perhaps this is my problem with this film -- I may not understand Chinese humor.In any case, if you are a hardcore fan of the Shaw Brothers films. buy this for your collection. If you are looking for an action-packed classic Kung Fu movie, look elsewhere."
4,Great Martial Arts Action,"For anyone interested in the Martial Arts genre, this film will provide excellent entertainment. Lots of action and a reasonable story line."
2,"Sad Story, beautiful costumes and rich spectacles","The costumes are magnificent (direct from the museum I guess), the spectacles are well orchestrated, and Gerard Depardieu is in the cast, but the story is so sad; a lot of jealous people despise Vatelle, the cook; they will do all they can to prevent him from succeeding; he commits to pay his providers on behalf of his master; and at the end, the pressure on him is so strong that he just snaps and commits suicide. So Vatelle is a typically sad story.That is why I didn't like it."
3,"Lovely period piece, somewhat lacking in depth","Though the costumes, acting, and setting were all interesting, over all I was disapointed. The film was a little slow."
4,"Lavish, perhaps one-star too over-the-top","This ultra-lavish movie is based on the true story of a steward for a nobleman who wants to curry favor with the decadent Louis XIV. The settings, the waterworks and fireworks, the complex presentations of food, the style of dress - - - all the pomp and pagentry tend to get somewhat in the way of the underlying story. Sexy Uma Thurman, mistress of the young king, enters into an improbable affair with the steward, drawn (we are expected to believe) to his innate goodness. But the crux of the whole tale rests on a bet in a poker game...To tell more would be to tell too much.Good flik."
2,"Great art direction, little else","Gerard Depardieu plays a steward of a French Prince who must win the favor of King Louis IV by lavishing him with amazingly extravagant banquets. Uma Thurman and Tim Roth join Depardieu in sleepwalking through their uninspiring performances, delivered in English despite being based on actual events in French history. The art direction during the banquets is very impressive, but there is little else of interest in this tale of aristocratic decadence and trickery. The only extra on the DVD is a very short piece supposedly (but hardly actually) about the film's costumes. This is one DVD that could definitely benefit from the typical extras such as a commentary track to help us get a notion as to why the film was ever produced. Fans of period costume pieces should watch ones with more substance such as Moulin Rouge, Shakespeare in Love, or Rob Roy."
2,not as advertised,"The mugs are large and pretty but not stoneware! They are ceramic so now to me they are useless, B."
4,The oldies music aptitude test,"A very interesting book that will rattle the chains of any self respecting ""Baby Boomer"" with rock n roll memories from the 50's and 60's! Being in the middle of this target group: (Class of ""67""/BEHS), I enjoyed this book immensely! Warning: do not give these quizes to anyone born after : 1960! They will give you a blank stare! :-)"
1,This is not Oldies Trivia,"I just received the Oldies Music Aptitude Test and was very excited to meander through the artists that started it all. Boy what a disappointment! I would consider Oldies from 1954 to 1964-65 when the Motown movement came into full swing. Let me give you a few examples referenced in the book: LaBelle (1975 song), Meatloaf (1978 Song), Olivia Newton John(1975 Song), The Buoys (1971 song), Commodores (1981), John Cougar (1982) Bruce Springsteen, Ted Nugent (1976), Lynyrd Skynyrd, Da Ya Think I'm Sexy (1979) These are just a few examples. If you want a book that has little oldies trivia, but good music trivia of the `60s, `70s & `80s this is your book - If you looking for Oldies Trivia save your money. If your looking for good Oldies Trivia try Doo Wop and Rock & Roll both by Cousin Brucie, The Top Ten by Bob Gilbert and Gary Theroux, Rock 'n Roll Years, by Cresent Books, Half the book is pre '70s, Rock On Almanac by Norm Nite, half the book is pre '70s just to name a few."
5,"Brilliant, honest","FAQs may not be entirely realistic, but that's not its point. It is a beautiful, well-crafted, touchingly acted, inventively directed independent film about disenfranchised, abused young gay people who protect and care for each other after being victimized by violent familial and societal fallout from our current (7/2006) government-endorsed homophobic culture. It is warm, loving, moving, angry, sexy, politically accurate, honest, triumphant. Straight people may not get its message nor be able to process its images--as with most of Everett Lewis' films, so they may want to buy something more accessible like ""Latter Days"" or ""Brokeback Mountain"" (both wonderful films, but more mainstream)."
2,STUPID,"Didnt like this movie at all. Very boring, acting is alright, not much of a story to it. Wouldnt pay alot money for this dvd."
2,Sigh,"I wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't get past the awkward and unnatural dialogue. The script was horrible. I felt sorry for the actors, it was impossible to see if they were any good with such a strange script. Even good acting couldn't have saved this movie. The script is the foundation, if it is cracked then the film will fall. When the film started with quotes from the texas republicans..I thought oh this will be good! Man...sadly this was a horrible film. Cute boys..good moments, but they are fleeting. If you want a better movie check out Latter Days."
5,Making Capitalism Work,"This book explains why the health of the stock market is not equivalent to the health of the economy. The Wall Street bull has transferred enoumous amounts of wealth from the bottom 95% to the top 5% of the population. The result is an economy that is producing goods and services at a rate that is well below its capacity to produce, reducing the standard of living of all but those few who are winning the speculative Wall Street lottery. The book is written in an engaging style with plenty of data to back up the claims. A very important book for a very crucial time in the economic history of the US."
4,great book,lots of fancy dish of desserts. giving it a 4 stars because i havnt use it yet. but i like what i see so far
3,i LIKED IT,I liked it. A bought a few versions because I was looking for something special.Have a wonderful Holiday...See you.
5,Carriying your baby is really easy and safe,"There is no need to spend lots of money to carry your baby safely,Infantino GoGoRider is enough for all your requirements."
4,Vintage Steele -- a fun glimpse into Laura's Mysterious Past,"This is my favorite episode of ""Remington Steele"". We get a look at how Laura's past turned her into a ""don't mix business with pleasure"" professional. You'll love her wild striptease in the winery......and that steamy kiss in the wine cellar!!! Wow!! This is one episode not to be missed. And we get to meet her mysterious man who wore white belts and T-shirts that said ""Bankers do it with interest"". Mr. Steele finds out he's not the only one with secrets. It's a true Remington Steele fan's delight."
2,Didn't like this episode.,"I thought this episode very strange. Maybe I just don't like westerns. It was like a slapstick western with too many characters. I do like the Remington Steele TV show overall, but not really this one."
4,This episode brings back so many memories.,"I'm a fan that died hard when they cancelled this show. The anticipation of a kiss between laura and remington steele would leave you almost breathless. This episode by far is one of my favorites because they finally kissed. I will admit the storyline was a bit cheesy but it was the from the ""80's"" era what else do you expect? I really enjoyed watching this episode again and I'm sure if you were a true fan you will too."
2,Beware of picture,"The picture and description lead you to think that you are getting a package of two sets of shoe trees per unit. Not true. Each package contains one set of shoe trees. This sleight of hand makes the set look much cheaper than other internet options whereas the reality is that at a little over 22 bucks a pop per pair they are toward the high end of pieces available on the web. In terms of quality of the actual product, it is ok, but not as well made or as finished looking and feeling as what I can buy from a high end shoe store for $29 with no shipping to pay."
5,The basis for healthy relationships,"I have read several books about forgiveness. This book is the best I have ever read. Author Jeffress walks you through all the reasons why you shouldn't forgive (what YOU think) and then makes it clear that what YOU think is wrong. I have loaned several of these books to people that are going through divorce. I never get them back!!!!If you are struggling with anger, bitterness, and resentment you are suffering the affects of unforgiveness. Until you make the decision to forgive and free yourself from the control of others you will not have great relationships.A must read for those that counsel others toward forgiveness."
5,Rapture in Death,"As always Nora Roberts has outdone herself. Reading her In Death series simply takes me away from the ordinary and transports me into the future. So much so, that I have even started thinking in those terms! Although a Nora Roberts fan for forever, I have only now started reading her In Death series. Eve and Rourke make the perfect couple and the differences between them never get old! In this book, the use of subliminal messages was outstanding and working it into the book so that it even effects the main characters was awesome!"
5,Mind bending murder,This book is so clever! Ostensibly a murder mystery set in the year 2058 where the victims are somehow being enticed to commit suicide. However the author has written in a terrific and subtle subplot. The murders are being investigated by New York police lieutenant Eve Dallas. Only married 3 weeks Eve and her husband Roarke's relationship is tested at a fundamental level by the machinations of a mood controlling sound engineer. In the other books in the series Eve relies on Roarke's presence in order to fulfil a need as basic as good night's sleep so it is only fitting that in Rapture in Death it is Eve who gives Roarke the strength to come through their dilemma. Eve solves the murders in her usual way - by getting it wrong!! However that hasn't stopped me buying all seven books in the series and placing an order for 'Conspiracy in Death'. Nora - I think you're brilliant but I can't imagine how you cope with that sort of output!!!
4,An Early Success,"Not the best in the series by far. You're still getting to know the characters and not really enough time is spent focusing on who they are. The story is what it's intended to be. A distraction from reality. You're forced to ""put aside"" your need to get to know the character and follow them through their daily lives. This teaches a few things about the character but you don't really learn much about them until later books.The story itself is nice, suspenseful, but could have been better with maybe 20 or 30 more pages just focusing on character explication and motivation."
3,rapture in death,"good. Ongoing character development means it is best to read those which precede this one. very satisfied with this one and those that follow this one, thus far."
5,Great mystery,"I have greatly enjoyed all of the ""in death"" series. I finally began at the beginning of the Dallas/Rouarke relationship and enjoy their easy friendship as well as their moulded backgrounds."
5,Awesome book-great service!,"Another favorite by JD Robb (Nora Roberts)! The service was wonderful too! In dealing with a problem created by the post office, this vendor was prompt, courteous, & helpful!"
2,Getting Old,"Although I enjoyed the first ""In Death"" book, I have to admit it's getting old. I keep getting this distinct feeling of deja vu everytime I read another book in the series. It's time to stop using the same recycled plot and change it up a little. This series has a lot of potential, but it seems that the author is too comforatable in the plot outline she is using now. A realize a lot of people love this series, but I'm finding it difficult to understand why. It took me three months to finish this book! Why? The explanations are too vague, the dialogue is too boring, and the plot is too predictable."
2,Sci-Fi tale featuring a FOUL MOUTHED female cop,"I have been reading mysteries, detective books (latest being ""Trunk Music"" by Connelly) and I finally put ""Rapture in Death"" down due to BOREDOM and the fact that every word out of Dallas' mouth was profanity and vulgaries. Apparently to be the lead character in one of Roberts' books you need to be extremely FOUL MOUTHED, otherwise you just can't possibly be taken seriously. (As a former officer in the US Navy, I can tell Ms. Roberts that a woman officer, cop or military, is addressed as Ma'am, or her rank, not Sir, as her equally boring sidekick addresses Dallas. So much for Roberts' knowledge of any female holding rank in the military or police.) I am appalled at the many 10s that this piece of garbage got. I will read Michael Connelly, and others like him, before I would ever consider picking up anything again written by Roberts, Robb, or any other name she selects."
5,The best!!!,"I' not really a suspense, mystery or even a sci-fi fan. But after reading the first chapter of the series, I was hooked. I spent hours in the library looking for ALL her books and finally went out and bought them. The plot leaves you biting your nails and dreading the time when you have to stop reading to do something useless like sleep!"
4,A darker book in the series,"RAPTURE IN DEATH is the darkest of the J.D.Robb Eve Dallas novels. We see more of the detectives terrifying past life. Roarke, the gorgeous Irishman with the criminal past (and shady present), is now Eve's husband. He is shown at his worst, in an unsettling scene. Peabody, Mavis, and Feeny are fun as always, but there's a nasty layer to this book. Still, it's well written, and even though the characters are often shown in an unfavorable light, RAPTURE IN DEATH is a welcome addition to the series."
5,rapture in death,The book was very good and I would recommed this book to my friends. J.D. Robb is a good writer and story teller and I will continue reading her books
4,Rapture In Death,"It's always disappointing to finish a series, it feels as though I'm saying ""goodbye"" to a good friend. I chose this series because the number of books guaranteed a long ""relationship"". I am addicted to these stories. They are a ""light"", great leisure reading, filled with intrigue, action, and sexy situations. Dallas is a cop with a personality that many can relate, and Roarke may just fill in the blanks of your fantasy man! I highly recommend this series for any ""female"" reader, but I recommend you read them in order for character development, etc."
4,J.D. Robb's enjoyable mixture of romance and murder.,J.D. Robb keeps getting better with her latest Eve Dallas & Roarke thriller. Hooked from the very beginning and couldn't put it down.
4,Love the Humor!,"The entire series is marvelous! All of the characters are such fun (I'm rather fond of Summerset, myself). Most of all, there is such wicked humor scattered in with the love - and the murders. The BEST is Morris' reference to his ""vintage videos"". I won't give away the zinger in ""Rapture"", but I was in hysterics! I can hardly till I have the rest of the collection."
3,Enjoyable Escapism,"Unrealistic ""romance"" and simplistic mysteries, but a gread read when you just want to escape - take the whole pile to the beach with you !"
5,Awesome!,Got my book in less time than anticipated and in excellent condition-as always!! Love buying books from Amazon!!
4,Rapture in Death,"As always, JD Robb comes thru with an enjoyable read. This particular book starts slow, which is why I only gave it four stars, but the end is action packed."
3,Investigating death on a honeymoon just can't bode well for a marriage.,While off-planet at the still unopened Olympus Resort Eve & Roarke enjoy their time together - even when interrupted to check out a death. Upon returning home Eve realizes that other suicides are happening - but for no apparent reason. These are people that even the profilers would never have anticipated committing suicide. Eve knows there's a connection - now she just has to find it.
1,Do not buy it,"Like the other reviewrs pointed out, the earbuds are huge and hard, and feel really uncomfortable right when you put them in the ears. After about half hour (I can't take it longer), my ears hurt so much I wish I never bought this thing. The only reason I got it is it's the only set I found that uses LG's native connection plug for VX8600. The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low."
1,HORRBILE,"I absolutely hate this product. The earbuds were so heavy and big that they kept falling out of my ear! I don't have small ears by any means(the ipod buds that come with the apple ipod are fine in my ears), and I couldn't believe that I spent money on something that just sits in my desk now.-L"
3,so so,"I got these to listen to music more than to use as a hands-free device. The ear buds kind of hurt my ears, and I cant vouch for the speaker but the sound quality is great."
5,Well worth watching,"An amazing cast did this movie proud. Naomi Watts acted her heart out, and even if her accent sounds a little more Australian than English, she still did well, being utterly believeable in her role; indeed, the whole cast acted as if vying for an Oscar. Jack Davenport was as enigmatic as usual, of course.An interesting, fast-paced storyline keeps the interest, and there are thrills and dramas aplenty. I would highly recommend this British movie to anyone who likes mysteries and Gothic thrillers.I haven't read the book this is based on, so I can't comment on how it compares to the book. Judging by the other reviews, it would appear that it is actually an advantage not to read the book first, because doing so seems to jade people's opinions of the movie. But that so often happens with book-to-movie transitions, doesn't it?"
3,"Nice new edition, but something is missing","This is a wonderful book about education and children's stories. But it loses two stars because for some reason, Kohl's great essay ""Rosa Was Tired"" has been removed from this edition. You'll need to get the original edition of ""Should We Burn Babar?"" if you want to read Kohl's fascinating exploration of the way Rosa Parks' story was distorted in schools all over America."
5,Oh My GOD!,"Have you ever heard Shania sound so vulnerable? This is such a different tone shania takes.this song is so beautiful it'll touch you in all the right places.it's one of those songs where the theme is quite obvious ""Don't Give Up On Me""..i'm used to shania singing more about uplifting songs..this is a song about hope,hoping to work a relationship out where you're being shut out from a particular someone and you just want to be there for them..this song is taken from her greatest hits cd...most of all this song will hit you good and the video for this song is just outstanding!shania just gets even hotter! i'm truly amazed with this song..its not a usual sound for shania but it is indeed a greatest hit!"
5,Great Music,The ever eclectic and talented Mason Williams creates music dedicated to rivers.....sort of a history of American rivers in song; you won't be sorry you purchased this cd---I have owned it on cassette for 10 years and still listen to it regularly. Thanks Mason.
3,The Best is Good; The rest . . .,"I bought this CD because I fell in love with this beautiful rendition of Shenandoah. However, this album was just too eclectic for my taste, in terms of musical styles. It is still quite worth owning, however."
2,DAMAGED CD,I BOUGHT CD AS A GIFT TO BE GIVEN 6 MONTHS OUT FROM PURCHASE. RECEIVER OF GIFT REPORTED IT WAS SCRATCHED THROUGHOUT. I GOT CD BACK AND ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT SELLER TO ASK FOR NEW ONE. NO RESPONSE. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
2,nothing major,The plot was alright. None of the characters were believable or even likeable and there were a few characters that weren't really relevant to the story. The final result wasn't surprising enough it was just simple which is a bummer especially since you have to go through all those cliffhangers to find a regular end.
5,Best Laura Lippman I've Read,"Disclaimer: I discovered Laura Lippman on my kindle, and have read many of her novels out of orderThat said, I really loved this book. This seemed a great detraction from the detective/suspense type novels I've read of Lippman's but still kept me riveted and wondering what happened/would happen. I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy Jodi Picoult's stories, as it is quite similar."
4,Interesting and insightful analysis of lives growning up,"This is such a difference from the Tess Monaghan books. It is well written and the characters lives and thoughts are really believable. It is a good study of a community, family, parents and friends in their relationships with each other and how they can affect each other in good and bad ways."
3,Tiresome trio,"Police investigate a high school shooting where one girl is dead and two injured. The trio has been friends since grade school and no one can understand how such a tragedy could happen. The story returns to their earliest days together, from grade school, middle school and climaxes in their final days of senior school with the usual teenaged angst and dramas. I became very bored with these girls quite early in the book, with the petty squabbles, jealousies and one-upmanship supposedly attributed to all girls of this age. If this is true, then thank heavens that I was born into an age where your every waking moment didn't have to be devoted to gaining credits and full of organised activities, but was allowed to develop at my own pace. I'm not really sure just what the shooting was about, except that it was exacerbated by pushy, manipulative parents and children who were much too self absorbed!"
2,Boring -and- Excruciatingly Slow,"Is it really possible that such an accomplished author can take such a thrilling situation as fraught with conflict as three teenage girls in a school shooting and turn it into one of the most boring books on the shelves? I'd give this project a D and request a class repeat. It's such an intriguing concept sadly wasted in painfully slow, indulgent writing. Save your money. Save some trees."
5,This book stays with you long after the last page.....,Fantastic read....i could not put it down ...and i never saw the ending comingAlready picked-out my next Lippman BOOKS
2,Good story but way too many characters and plots,"Three friends Kat, Josie and Perri make a pact when they are young, to always stand up for each other and to always stay together.One day a shot rings out in school, and kat is left dead... perri was shot in the face and Josie is shot in the foot.But the stories are not adding up with the evidence and the police dig deeper in to old family secrets and hidden agendas.I found this book a good story line, but so many characters and plots were too confusing. It switched back and forth between present and past time.It was too confusing to be a good book and I agree with the other reviewer, the ending sucked!!!"
3,DISSAPPOINTING,"I am a big fan of the Tess Monaghan series but TO THE POWER OF THREE by Laura Lippman was a dissappointment. Three girls and a killing at the school, three girls we slowly learn alot about, maybe too much. So slow, it drags along. Not Lippman at her best. Read a different Lippman work."
4,To The Power of Three,This is a short well written book. The author developed the the characters well and did a great job of transporting the reader into the physical surrounding of the community in which the story takes place. The story develops the characters of teenagers of a few adults in a small community in which there was a school shooting. Was the shooting as it first appeared? Read the book and find out. P.S. The book if not already could be placed in teen reader section. It is however a book that I will recommend to my friends all of whom are 45 and up.
4,not a mystery to me,"The story plays out over several decades, jumping from past to present often. This isn't your standard mystery/thriller story but a good story all the same. If you are looking for a mystery/thriller you might be disappointed in this one. IF you are looking for a well told story, you will be glad your read this book. I do have to say there is a slight twist to the story in the end. Although the story did leave me feeling sad with how the events played out it was still very well told."
1,Disappointed,"I bought it on your recommendation when I was buying Janet Evanovich books, and was severely disappointed. The cast of characters was limited, the plot was dreary, the dialogue pathetic. It may belong in the mystery classification, but there wasn't much mystery! It was difficult to read, with the speaker changing often without notice, and altogether too confusing!"
3,Promising but comes up short,"This book starts off really well and seems to present what will be a complex and compelling story of Penny's anguish and struggle as a woman in dealing with her tragedy of years before. But as the book went on I found it to be describing too much of simply what she was doing, and not enough of why and what she was thinking, or what she hoped for in the end. Toward the end it lost something for me, which was disappointing considering the book's beginning and overall premise.Her internal struggle mentally and emotionally should have been given much more attention than the mechanics of her diabetes and daily rides. The relationship with Ndele could have been explored deeper to see exactly what it was she was hoping to develop with him.Overall, a good read, but could have gone much further and deeper"
1,Don't be misled,"I was attracted to this novel after reading a non-fiction article on stem cell research written by the author that was anthologized in Best American Science and Nature Writing. McManus' daughter has had diabetes since childhood, and when I discovered that he had written a novel about a 29-year-old woman with diabetes who takes a cross-country bike trip to lay her personal demons I hoped for a tale of overcoming great obstacles.I was taken with the character and kept reading to hear more about her even as the unlikely events piled one on top of the other. I gave the author a LOT of slack hoping for a thoughtful, enlightening denouement from someone who clearly is an accomplished writer as well as the parent of a diabetic.I will not spoil the book in case someone wants to read it, but suffice it to say that I felt betrayed and disgusted by the ending. My thought as I closed the book was, ""With all the books on my shelf to be read, why did I waste time on this?"" My advice, ""Don't."""
1,"Boring, unrealistic and annoying.","I read this book for a book club meeting knowing nothing about the author or the book itself. The most positive thing I can say about this book is that it is a very fast read. I was never able to identify or sympathize with the central character, Penny, and the fact that the entire book is a first person narrative from her perspective made it tedious to read. While the novel is clearly set in the present day and in real cities and towns (the author includes enough references to Starbucks, movies, T.V. shows, sports teams and CDs to alert the reader to this), the plot is utterly implausible and contrived. The secondary characters are stereotypical and the dialogue is stilted and unrealistic. The ""events"" in the novel are connected only by boring passages detailing the main character's every meal and diabetes regimen. My recommendation- heed the advice of the previous Chicago reader and avoid this book."
5,Dishwalla like you never heard them before.,"After listening absentmindedly to internet radio on my computer, I stumbled on the Live from the Flow State version of Every Little Thing.The fact that I didn't know Dishwalla until then only intensified the experience since I was listenting to something totally new for me.The performance was absolutely incredible, the voice disarming.I was completely taken aback by the fact that I had never heard about this group and immediately went and bought the CD.If you like live CDs this is one is worth it, and the best thing is, it doesn't matter if you know or like Dishwalla at all."
3,Ehhhh it's OK,The phone is a basic stripped cell. Great screen color and easy usability. The coverage was not as good as my husband's nokia (cingular) or his nextel. I felt like I was deaf. since i couldn't hear unless I was in complete silence. A fine generic phone withh average features.
3,Okay phone really bad service,"This is an okay phone if you don't want a fancy flip phone or you have never had a cell phone. It is easy to use, compact and light. There is a dark side to all this. The phone is fragile. It doesn't take to being dropped very well. The ringtones are stupid and not very loud. If you would like to download ringtones that can run you from $2.49 to $2.99. At T-Mobile I can get them for a dollar less. The reception for Cingular is truly pathetic. I couldn't get reception anywhere and that bothered me. I was dropping calls all the time."
4,"OK phone, complicated interface","We just switched to Cingular, b/c Sprint wouldn't give us free phones for re-upping another 2 year contract. I like this phone-- it doesn't get hot like my old dinosaur did. However, the interface is a bit complicated. Why do I have to flip through so many menus to check voice mail, etc?? Also, I have yet to figure out an easy way to turn the ringer off. My old phone had a one-button solution. Guess I'll check the owner's manual.Oh, and the tip from the reviewer below about putting a password on the internet is GOLD."
4,Simple yet durable,"I got this phone a few years ago when it came out. At the time, camera phones were the coolest thing in school, and I thought this phone was useless. Now, years later, I'm still using it. This phone doesn't have many fancy features, but it works fine for placing a call and text messaging.Also, charge it to full and you're set for at least 3 days. I have run it on the last battery bar for 4 or 5 days before without any trouble from it.The most amazing thing to me about this phone is its durability. When I first got it I thought it felt cheap, and I was sure it would break quickly. I have dropped it many times on concrete, let it sit in water, dropped it in mud, and on one occasion it was hit with a sword, and yet I have had no problems at all with this phone. Simply put, this thing is a tank.If you don't need all the fancy functions like cameras, computer sync, speaker phone, and all that, this phone is fantastic, especially for the price. It won't ever fail on you."
1,Now I know why it was FREE!,This phone was great to start off with. But after about 3 1/2 months the phone started to drop calls every so often. Now 1 month later it is dropping calls very frequently. Sometimes with five bars the call just dissconects. I know it's not Cingular the Motorola v551 in the same exact spot is still crystal clear. Do your self a favor stay away from the x427m. If you buy Cingular try to get the v551 from www.cellularchoices.com and you will get a great quality phone for free! (P.S.-This phone shouldnt even have 1 star)
1,Unreliable Caller ID,"As others have mentioned, the caller ID on this phone is very unreliable. It will display random names from my phonebook instead of the actual caller every few calls.Although this is annoying, the customer service from Cingular is worse. I have been sent to about three stores. I have been put on hold for over 20 minutes at a time when I call the warranty office. I have been sent a new phone with the exact same problem. I have gotten a new SIM card, which did not solve the problem. AND, since I was given a new SIM card, the woman who helped me ""killed"" the original, therefore deleting my entire phonebook. I had to re-enter everyone I know manually.This phone, although it is very cute and has a handful of good features, really is a pain in the butt."
1,I am A cingular salesmen,"Ok look I have to Sell Cingular wireless Im the Anoying guy that calls you and trys to set you up with a plan and a phone. FIRST things first, the most reliable network . The biggest joke in the world. second your all getting ripped off on those phones The smasung is really only Worth 20$ but you guys are paying 49$ for itWe basically work like this, WE AT CINGULAR DO NOT LIE ABOUT THE SERVICE , WE CANT HELP THEY DIDNT ASK.... me I have T mobile Its the best. SO DO NOT GET CINGULAR WIRELESS>>>>>>"
1,VERY POOR RECEPTION,"I have the Samsung X427M and a plan with CINGULAR. I have had a few phones in the past on my cingular plan and this phone is, by far, the worst. If you cannot hear the person you are talking to on the other end and they cannot hear you, what good is the phone?If I could give this item 0 stars, I would. Cingular needs to revamp its network and test the phones it carries.Jon"
3,Alright,This cd was alright. I heard her vocals on the choppa style cd. I thought it would be more upbeat like his cd. This cd is more on the r&b side she has more slow songs than fast songs. But there are a few songs I like.
1,Golf in the Kingdom,Did not like this movie. Watched it for a brief short time. Did not make any sense to me. Would not recommend this to anyone. Worse purchase I have ever bought. Sorry that I had to lose money on returning it when the product wasn't what you wanted and that was to enjoy a good golf movie.
5,Great Strategy game,"I loved this game. The graphics are absolutley mind-blowing. You thought the detail in Warhammer 40K: Dawn of war was awesome, zoom in on one of the SHIELD units or any other unit for that matter. When you get some of the really big weapons, they will leave craters, ignite buildings, cause mass distruction. You have to see the effect of the wolverine cruise missle on surrounding buildings from the blast area. Awesome story line for the game and the missions are a blast also. The only issue I have with this game is the length, I beat it in 12 hours on Hard. I will still be playing it though in Skirmish mode and online. I love the game and wholeheartedly recommend buying it."
5,Act of War,"Honestly, this is one of the best RTS games I have played in...oh...years. Really I'd like to say something to whoever posted the comment about how the game doesn't come with a tutorial. If you played the game for more than FIVE minutes, and if you had the nessessary intelligence to understand that you are playing an RTS game, you wouldn't have such a problem, dear.Good game. Go. Now. Purchase."
2,Good video clips but game length was much too short,"This video game looks good for its type. The video sequences were well acted, and fit with the game. However, I wish that they skipped some of the long video sequences for more levels to the game!!!!!!!!!! I am not a serious gamer and I finished it in about 15 hours of play on the hard level on my first play through! 2 or 3 tries on a level and I was done.There was also a sense that the game was rushed. I didn't get a feel that the ""enemy"" was a thinking one. I expected a lot more for $50 than what I got."
1,Warning,Do not buy if you have windows 7 because it isn't compatible. Other then that the game is great to play enjoy.
5,fun,"Played this game all the time in my friends house and now I own it and I'm having a blast all the time now, great game, great buy, great deal."
3,"fun game, frustrating to make work","While this game is almost exactly what I was looking for, it is really frustrating to make it work on a Windows 7 64 bit computer. I have to reduce the amount of processors and memory being used and reboot just to make it work. Amazingly enough, an older game of mine, Star Wars Galactic Battle Grounds will work just fine, with out any issues. Maybe Atari needs to go to talk to the makers of Age of Empires about making a more versatile programming code.The game is fun once you get it working. I love calling in air strikes."
2,WARNING: Nvidia geforce4 cards do not work for this game.,"I've got a late model GeForce4 graphics card and I picked up this game after glancing at the requirements (64MB, 128MB Recommended, GeForce3 and above). Well I failed to see the little astrisk after that that pointed to some small type at the bottom that read ""except for GEForce4"" which I think is important enough to warrant a big yellow warning on the front of the box listing all of the higher end graphics cards that it is incompatible with. So, long story short, I'm stuck with a $50 dog that I can't play that I will probably end up selling here for $30 which is what I imagine happened to half the individual sellers here. Caveat Emptor."
1,Won't work on computers that play most games just fine.,"Pretty shabby! It would install but it would not play because it needed some obscure video card feature. Most EA games and a lot of others work fine on our machines, but not this one. Beware!Act of War: Direct Action (DVD)"
2,This game is just a beta version,"The graphics are very nice, but the gameplay is not worthy of anything more than one star.This game is obviously just a beta test version. There is no useful tutorial to learn how to play this game, so don't bother purchasing this game. If you bother to spend more than a few minutes playing this game, you will quickly realize that the designers of this game did not bother to teach you how to play it. There is no tutorial at all. The windows that pop up have no explanation. This game is a perfect example of bad design. It may be fun for the people who designed it -- they know how to play it. But if you install this game and run it, you will get no instructions about how to play it.Bottom line: decent graphics but no instructions -- and not even a welcoming introduction to how the gameplay works. Stick with C&C; and don't waste your money on this game."
2,Be smart - don't buy refurbished,"I didn't read the fine print apparently. This was a refurbished CF card and would not work in my d70s Nikon. I had to return it. However, packaging was excellent, shipping was perfect, and return was not a problem. Deal Stop was very easy to deal with."
2,Information on Hitachi microdrives,"I bought a Hitachi microdirive MD6GBBP in $50 through Amazon, but it wasnot able to connect to any notebook PC through any PC card adaptor becasuethis microdrive I bought wqas a white lavel one even though the ADD pagewas shown in blue lavel one as shown in this request page of my review.There are two types of Hitach microdrives according to Hitachi. One hasblue lavel like shown on this web site. The other has white lavel. Cheapone had white lavel.I found the defference after I got a response of Hitachi support centeron my question how to get and install the driver. Hitachi said they willnever support the microdrive with white lavel directly.Now I use it through a memory card adoptor after re-formatting. It runswell even though the microdrive is white lavel one."
2,Beware!,"I have been using this microdrive occasionally with my Sony Alpha DSLR-A100 and it worked great - pretty fast considering - until the last time I inserted it and turned on my camera. It immediately shut down and would not power up again. I had to send it into Sony, along with the microdrive, and they reported that the microdrive was ""bad"" and it caused the DC converter card to blow. $220 later...... and it only has a 1 year warranty.HITACHI 6GB Microdrive MD6GBBP"
2,Mediocre at best,I am a big Beatles fan and have been for many years. I lost interest in watching this video after 30 minutes. I would spend your money elsewhere.
5,Great movie,"I watched this movie in November of 2000 on tv. This is a great movie about John Lennon and how the Beatles got started. It's a memorable movie that you won't forget. If you love the Beatles, or want to know more about John Lennon and the Beatles, this is a great movie to watch."
3,Pretty much like Birth of the Beatles,"As someone else already said, this was all covered in Birth of the Beatles, except for the scenes with John's mother, and with his father in Blackpool in 1946.One other thing I wanted to mention was the notable absence of any Lennon-McCartney tunes, either as background music or played at their shows. (It's almost as if the producers didn't get the rights to the Lennon-McCartney catalog.) Sure they did a lot of covers back then, but other films show them playing I Saw Her Standing There and Love Me Do (and maybe others that escape me now)."
4,Enjoyable Movie,"The story may not be 100% accurate, but the acting is really good and the story is entertaining. Probably the best parts of the film are when John is with Brian Epstein. That part of John's life isn't talked about all that much, but it is always interesting to see and hear. What I liked most about this movie is that it goes a little further than the movie Backbeat. Although it isn't the Beatles singing, I also enjoyed how some of the more famous Beatles songs made it in. For a made-for-TV movie, I 'd say that this one is pretty good. You will enjoy it if you are a fan or maybe even not. Worth seeing."
5,Great for homeschooling!,I purchased this dictionary for my daughters to use along with the A.C.E. curriculum that we use for homeschooling. It is fantastic! It has made doing their schoolwork much easier and faster. I would recommend it for homeschooling students of any age!
1,Curtom de Coeur,"My problem with this album is not the fact that it's a collection of modern interpretations of already perfect and brilliant compositions, rather that I don't believe the vocals on this album actually belong to the great Curtis Mayfield.For the most part, the vocals here are definitely not taken from the original versions of these songs. One could argue that rare outtakes and/or alternate mixes were utilized, but I don't buy it. This just doesn't sound like Curtis Mayfield to me, rather someone impersonating Mayfield. Anyone else agree?"
1,Curtis Probably Wouldn't Be Happy,"This has got to be one of the worst albums I've heard. Most songs are unrecognizable from the originals. If you like Curtis, skip this. If you are a fan of house music, you may like it."
4,More than a Remixed,The 4 stars is an average between the bravery to Remix a MonsterKing of the music (5 stars for bravery) and for the outcome music(3 stars).The cd is a little more than a remixed and a little less that a remake.The original songs are easy to identify but finally they are new songs (this is a remix or a remake?).Anyway if you are a fan of Curtis probably you miss this side of his music (but if you are a purist probably you will not like it)and if you are a beginner probably is a good way to know the King Curtis.A clever experience i am happy that this cd is in my collection.
1,For those who like terrible music...,"I never do this but I could not resist this time.If you are one of those people who believes that everything old should be made new again, then buy this record. If you are one of those people who believes that some music is classic and should not be remixed or fooled around with in any way, then stay clear of this record.I sometimes wonder if these DJs realize what they're doing. I'm sure none of them care about the music or the message that Curtis Mayfield was trying to hip people to. If they did they would not turn his incredible, heartbreaking, socially-aware music into over-syncopated nonsense for drunken fools to dance and grind to in the clubs.Shame on you DJs, shame on you if you licensed the rights to these songs, and shame on you if you buy this record. Check out ""Roots"" or ""There's No Place Like America Today."" Don't buy this!!!Some things old should not be made new again..."
5,Good eye opening movie,Great movie and message. Everyone should see it and start thinking. We have a mess! Good value and fast service.
4,Compelling and Informative Documentary,"I think many should see this film for ""perspective"" on the situation with poverty. It's an excellent and informative piece."
4,Pro and Con of History,"Dear Viewers,The information in this DVD will bring you to the point of being part of the solution or part of the problem.It makes no difference if you are better off than someone else.We need to start to reverse some of the causes of poverty with ethical behavior across the board. Education with truth intended would help.!!"
3,"Asks the Right Questions, but Left me Not Caring about the Answer","it certainly is the question for our time: if capitalism is so great what has it done about poverty? Is poverty on average really going up or down? In America poverty has gone up as total wealth has gone up, but is that only because poverty in China is going down, so that on average globally poverty is going down? Well, about halfway through this snoozer, I gave up caring. Sorry. I am a documentary addict but just couldn't get through this one. I might give it another shot sometime. Kudos to the filmakers for trying, though."
1,Very skewed film,"This film was terribly boring. I thought I would be watching a documentary which would address solutions to poverty in the third world. Instead, I was watching a film which basically presented a rant on how colonialism was responsible for destroying native cultures and societies back in the 1600's (which is widely acknowledged in history books) and how western nations are still responsible for the shape and state of poverty in third-world countries (I am not convinced from the film).The film was very skewed in the way it presented information to make it points - mainly it seems to attribute capitalism and privatization as the cause of poverty in areas like Bolivia, Kenyva, and in other slums.Skip. This film is much too biased. Towards the end, the movie starts to target neoliberalism - without giving me a good idea of what that is. I also felt the film was too overreaching in terms of trying to attribute third-world poverty to a few western countries, the World Bank, and the IMF."
3,OK,"Glad I have this and watched it. Also useful for education, but there are better films out there on such issues.It was missing something - but for the price, for sure an ad to the shelf (I found it for about $6)"
3,Works okay,You have to use a lot of the product more than 4 times daily but it does show some improvement
2,Crazy Movie,I did not enjoy this movie it was all over the place the story was confusing. Not one of Vivica Fox's best roles.
4,Original Concept,"I enjoyed Trapped. The movie started off one way and ended differently. I think that most people expected the film to be a traditionalrescue film. That is what I expected.Suddenly the plot thickens and we get a new twist to the film. But wait, there is still anothertwist at the end. It is similar to Shutter Island. I think that anyone who is a fan of Vivica Fox will enjoy this film. One F bomband a tastefully done sex scene. It would probably be rated PG-13. It is not a spooky film. It deals with the mind and how a shockingtraumatic experience can affect a persons mind and their perception of reality. Recommended for fans of mind benders like Shutter Island."
3,Handheld Game,"Unfortunately, I purchased this game because it had a lot of different games on it. I returned it because it was in black and white. I didn't realize games were still being sold in black and white. I didn't even give it to my grandchildren to play. I didn't think it would keep their attention long enough. It was a great price and looks very nice."
3,Flash 8,It doesn't tell you that you need Photoshop CS3 or better to get it to work for you in the animation phases.
1,Disappointed,"This book never got down to the meat of the whole issue! We want to make flash movies. The very first chapter should be...let`s get down to business! Let`s make our first movie. You have to wait until Chapter 9 to finally get to really do anything. The first chapter was a tease to make you read until chapter 9. Not very nice. And still...chapter nine is missing so much. I am going to make my own Flash journal for my students. I am going to show them how to make a simple animation, how to add to it, make changes, tweak, add key frames and plain frames and show them the differences! Perhaps I should try to publish. Purchasing this book made me look like a dummy. Sorry to pan it so much but it is useless. This is the first book I bought from Amazon that I got on the case of. Sorry. There have to be better books on this out there for people that want to get into it and not procrastinate on it.Any recommendations?"
1,They don't even warrant one star!,I read the reviews and I think people that gave these good reviews are lacking taste buds. OMG... these are horrible. I couldn't even swallow the first one. They are now being used as pretty expensive dog treats... seems the dogs like them.
5,delicious high protein low carb snack,This product is in a small HALF ounce bag and two bags are just the right serving size for a quick high protein low carb snack. The white cheddar flavor is delicious.
4,Walking Easy with Rockport Walking Shoes,"I have really enjoyed my Rockport Walking Shoes. Even though I am a woman, I find that the men's shoes fit me much better because they are wider and seem to fit me better. The EE is justs the right width for me, especially when my feet swell. I've used Rockport for years now - sometimes men's and sometimes women's and I've found them all to be to my liking."
5,Walking shoes.,This makes my third pair of these shoes. I walk 4 to 5 miles every day and they hold up well.
2,Good Collection - Terrible Quality,"This features the classic episodes from the later years of the Lucy Show, which if anyone has seen the entire series, the best of the series was during the first two season with Vivian Vance nad the original ""I Love Lucy"" writers. But, the DVD set is absolutely horrendous when it comes to playback quality. The picture quality is worse than a good VHS copy! The color is faded on a lot, and there seems to be some problems with syncing voice and picture on some episodes. Unfortunately, no one has a great Lucy Show set, so there aren't that many better options. Get it if you're curious, but be prepared for terrible video picture."
1,Not really a review.....,"I wish I could rate this DVD! But again the companies let the European Lucy Ball Fans down. First we could not buy VHS video-tapes released in USA, due to the different TV-systems..... So we hoped for the releases on DVD. But guess what: Region Codings.... Thus again: No Lucy Ball for her European Fans..... A pity and a missed chance!"
3,plastic tank,"Purchased this tank on 4/24/11 from AZ Parmaster.Came with all the mounting hardware for my 20 yr. old Artesisn bowl.The 1st thing I noticed was the hole on the bottom of the tank was not drilled evenly from side to side.Had to modify the base plate to be able to use the big gasket that seals the tank to the bowl!Finally after 4 hrs of messing with,I finally got it secured and working properly.The tank did not come with a liner,but the tank has not sweat yet!Called Lordahl manufacturing and spoke with Scott (847)244-0448 in Quality control and told him about the issue.I sent him pics and posted them here in images."
1,Braindead action film.,"Why can't film producers realise that if you want to make a film based on a video game you have to alter the video game aspects slightly to fit a film format. Non-stop action is fine if you're playing a 'Street-Fighter' arcade machine, but it doesn't make for a thrilling film.The wafer-thin plot involves maniac M.Bison holding hostages and demanding a lot of ransom money. So it's up to a lot of cardboard cut-outs with muscle to battle their way to the rescue. What this means is a lot of fighting and action with barely two words of dialogue.Will you recognize any of the characters from the video games in this film? You probably won't, as they look nothing like them. The pathetic attempt to bring Blanka to the movie screen is especially laughable.A total waste of time, though at least it's marginally better than that trashy animated abomination which is 'Sonic the Hedgehog:The Movie'."
1,High definition? You're kidding!!!,"I've bought several blu ray discs. When I bought ""The Godfaher"", I thought that was awful, because of the grainy vision. Then, I found out, that this is the best they could get, because the originals were lost. It's ok. With Street Fighter, there's no excuse. It looks worse than the DVD. I have no idea, why the company put it on Blu Ray. It's the worth Blu Ray ever, some scenes look awfully grain, I thought there was a problem with the LCD. I like this movie, because Raul Julia is in it. He was a great actor. This was it's last movie, he was already terrible ill, during this one. I'm going to keep it. But, if you want to buy it, I recomend you to buy the DVD."
1,MK vs SF,"I never liked this movie,because their special moves are pathetic.Van Damme is alright for Guile,but he doesn't look like Guile.This is one of the horribly movie based on a video game.The Street Fighter Legend of Chun-li was worse than this one.Mortal Kombat beats Street Fighter,because all you see in the MK videogame is what you see in the movie."
3,Not the worst...but still preety bad,There are worse movies based on games out there in the world but not a whole hell of a lot.The plot-generic good guys versus bad guysThe acting-this is where I think the movie makes up for itself. I both like it and hated it. I liked it when you could tell that the actors were doing their job tounge and check not taking it seriously. In that way the movie is almost like a comedy.I hated it when the actors were trying to be dramatic.Overall-A bad film but not the worst film. Bad acting but sometimes hilarious acting and there are a few great quotes.
1,foolish,"I remember watching this movie years ago. I was still nuts about street fighter back then so I thought it was the greatest. Well, a few days ago it was on the tube and I thought it would be cool to watch it again after all this time. I made it maybe about half way through. If you are a street fighter fan and havent seen it... rent it. Just to get it out of the way. But to have this in your movie library would just be embarassing."
3,"It's Fun, in a way.","By no means is this a good movie, but for a mindless action flick it is not too bad. There is a bunch of over action and groan outloud lines, but at the end of the movie you don't feel robbed in anyway. There are some really fun moments, on-liners, and some of the fighting is not done that bad.Sad note this is still a bare-bones DVD, just the movie and nothing else. You wished for maybe getting Van Dam to do some commentary or something by now."
3,A decent Buy,While not as polished as the other Street Fighter IV it does have some okay action in it. The main character change is a depature but out of respect to Raulo Julia who was a great actor I bought the Dvd. It was a decent buy and if you are a true collector its a must buy for the street fighter collection though I would buy it used.
3,It's a better movie than the all the Star Wars prequels.,"Yes it's a movie based on video game. The plot is stupid, but if you look closer at it (for those of us that are brave enough.) You might be somewhat dumbfounded and surprised that this movie is (and probably was) suppose to be funny.....stupid funny.This film has one of the greatest over the top character driven performances from Raul Julia, and just from watching him you can tell he was probably having a good time making the film.(Same goes for Timothy Dalton in Hot Fuzz.) And that is a rare thing to come by these days. For any novice actor out there that wants to see how an over top character should be portray can do no wrong watching this film (or at least parts of it).The day I saw Bison, explain to Guile that electricity powered his command center was the greatest and most important moment in my life, but for Bison, it was only Tuesday."
1,A fantastic piece of... [work]!!,"I wouldn't recommend buying this film to anyone! But if you're one of those crazy people who love laughably bad movies, then this is definitely worth adding to your crazy collection!!I can't really add much to what's already been said... here at Amazon... I totally agree with all of ...[it]!It is really crazy how the ""characters"" find their ""costumes"" in this movie. It's even more crazy how a lot of the characters are barely in the movie at all!The movie is extremely, unintentionally funny but the very end is the best where all the characters (try to) do the winning poses of their computer-game counterparts! It's just very bizarre as most of the characters don't really fight despite the movie being based on the Street Fighter II game!Besides the laugh factor, the only other reason to see this movie is for Kylie Minogue who looks fantastic as Cammy..."
1,THRASH !,Just watch this movie and you'll know what bad acting is. I believe it should be rated with a half star!
1,"The most #!?#*""^ stupid action movie I ever saw.","WELL,what do you say about a (street fighter)where ryu,sagat and vega(the best enemies against each other)join together to beat the silly looking bison,and where balrog(the evil boxer) joins with chun Li,and where the action is badly acted out by some freaks who don't even know how to throw a punch,and where T.hawk(the largest and biggest street fighterever) who appears as a 18-year old kid in this silly movie and where the story line is uninteresting and VERY boring???? I can't express my disgust with such a movie in words,and if only there was a""0""star rating which I can rate it with.There's not a single good point or any good thing about this movie nonetheless. one last word........what a shame for such a famed and famous action star like vandamme to 'go down' and accept acting in a movie like this one which is nothing like street fighterIIV and the games series."
2,about the movie street fighter.......,"One of the lose out films with comparision to time cop, blood sport, sudden death and lionheart. the advise is to avoid this and wait for his next release."
1,A legendary fighting game becomes an abysmal movie...,"Do I really need to mention why this movie is complete ass? Street Fighter II was a legendary arcade game that was super addictive and plain old fun to play! It was so popular that people said it would make a great movie. They made the Street Fighter movie and POW!!! It sucked like a tornado! The acting is garbage, Jean-Clude Van Damme can't act for hell's sake, and the special effects are almost non-existent! It also doesn't even have Ryu or Ken! Come on people! Street Fighter is one of the worst if not the worst movie I ever saw! Nothing is good about it except the license!"
1,THIS MOVIE BLOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS MOVIE BLOWS IT'S TERRIBLE. I REMEMBER ME MY BROTHER AND TWO COUISINS BEING IN LOVE WITH THIS GARBAGE BACK WHEN IT CAME OUT IN THEATRES JUST BECAUSE IT HAD STREET FIGHTER ATTACHED TO IT. BUT NOW I LOOK BACK ON THIS TRASH WITH NOTHING BUT DISGUST. I WARN EVERYONE TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE AT ALL COST YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID. OH YEAH I ONLY GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE NEGATIVE ONE MILLION WASN'T AN OPTION!
1,One of the Worst Movies Ever! Literally!,"The humiliating label of ""worst movie ever"" gets thrown around a lot, but Street Fighter truly deserves to be included in the list of worst movies ever. It's so bad, it's its own unique brand of bad. I mean, not only is it inept and stupid, it's just plain strange. From beginning to end, everything about this movie is strange, stupid and inept. Bewilderingly strange and bewilderingly stupid. A ""what were they thinking?"" curiousness pervades this whole movie. It's a movie that can only be tolerated in small doses it's so bad. I've never watched this movie once straight through from beginning to end. I think if I did I would end up looking like Blanka. Someone please put this film out of its misery and quite re-releasing it on DVD."
4,Street Fighter Blu-ray [Steve Sap Review],"LOL. What can I say about this movie. I'm not a Street Fighter fan but I respect the fighting franchise. My all time favorite is Mortal Kombat...Not to get off subject. When I watch this movie when I was young I thought this movie was serious action movie. But now I watch it, it was a comedic movie. I'm saying that because of the actors I mean the whole movie funny, the movie had nothing but humor in it. So it's true when they say watch a movie when you get older and you'll understand it more. But the quality of the movie is great (9/10) even though it's an old movie the transfer to blu-ray was phenomenal. Of course none of the special features are in high definition besides the Street Fighter IV trailers.Q.uic C.ash- Steve Sap! Your #1 Asian Guy!"
2,Low-rent action doesn't mix with subpar karate...,"Raul Julia's last film keeps itself alive using his performance as the bad guy. ""Street Fighter"" is a cheekishly bright kids movie based on the hit video game, although the plot and characters are very different. The violence is very stylized and almost slapstick. The humor here is arid, missing any form of timing or wit. Most of the movie just falls flat on its butt. It's not the worst video-game movie ever, but it's really not that good. I do, however, reccommend it to kids who are into karate. They might get a ""kick"" out of this... get it? Kick? Sorry about that one. At least it was better than the jokes in ""Street Fighter."""
2,I Was Fooled!,"I was tricked into watching this movie, I swear. My friends told me I was going to see ""Forrest Gump"", but I saw this in the theaters instead. They taped me to the seat and made me watch ""Street Fighter"", a movie I want to forget so much. It haunts me when I see E. Honda fighting Zangief like Godzilla monsters in my dreams. I am forever haunted with Van Damme movies."
1,It`s a shame this had to be Raul Julia`s last film,"Van Damme should of fired his agent for letting him star in this unmemorable action film based on a video game. Van Damme plays a big macho man commando with his high tech army tries to stop a viscious warlord from killing hostges for a $20 millon dollor ransom. Raul Julia who was diagnosed with some sort of cancer was clearly noticable he wasn`t up to the task as usually is and probbaly did this film for the sheer thrill of it. A waste of the man`s acting talent. As for van damme this type of garbage is right up his ally, big special effects, corny villans, stupid one liners and an idiotc storyline that is barely cohenrent. One of the worst films i`ve have seen that is based on a video game. But then again what kind of decent story can someone get out of a video game?"
1,S-T-U-P-I-D,"Is it just me or is all the video game turned movies among the worst ever made? After the success of the games, maybe they could have afforded better writers who didn't smoke illegal substances all the time."
5,Anybody who thinks this movie sucks has probably been on crack or still takes it,"First off idiot this is suppose to be a live videogame movie.So why are all you people gonna say this has bad acting,bad plot,and bad writing.IT'S SUPPOSE TO!Remember this is a kid action videogame movie it's not suppose to win a thousand awards know is it.So please shut your chatter box.By the way if you like Jean-Claude Van Damme this is not something he usually does and you know it.Don't act stupid if you play the videogames that's probably how you're going to love this movie.All I'm saying is don't be an idiot like most people are when they critise this movie."
1,Did they really have to do this?,"I'll keep this short and simple.Everyone who thought Super Mario Brothers was a a horrible movie knows how much worse this one is. It is by far the worst video game to movie translation ever. The only reason this is being put on blu-ray is because there is another one being released this year based off of Chun Li, one of the characters in the game. Don't buy this unless you're doing your own Mystery Science Theater night with some friends.That or you really like to make yourself suffer."
3,"Okay, it's got a story and will keep kids watching","I really think Dolph Lundgren(The Punnisher, Rocky 4, Universal Soldier) would have been better as Guile. He even looks like the video game character. But Van Damme's name will sell. Okay fine. The movie has goofy acting, sets, costumes, lines, etc. But it's a complete movie and I felt it deserves 3 stars."
3,Could Have been Better,"Street Fighter could have been better I thought Jean-Cluade Van Damme would be the star but no and it could have more action in it,I think it desevre a 3 instead of 5 stars.Also it could have been a little bit anime like the animated series then it would have been better-I think anime is better so get it"
1,Oh god...,"How the hell can they even make a movie this bad,didnt they read the script first! This is like one of the worst movies ever.Only ""Turbulence"" was worse movie than this one.This has absolutely nothing,bad huomour,bad effects,bad acting etc. dammit this was a really bad send off for a good actor like Raul Julia,he would have deserved much more... Only some of the Vietnam refrences were pretty good..."
2,Not movie worthy,"I have seen Street fighter way back when i was a kid. Now they play it on cable all the time. and to this day, i still wonder why the hell they made a movie out of it. Its only good to look at when you don't have nothing else to look at or you just winding down to go to sleep."
3,Good Enough,I still think they should have stuck more to the video game. Some of the costumes are off but it was still an Okay flick. Would recommend but only to those that can enjoy the concept of the game.
2,A bad movie with some redeaming qualities,"Ok so Claud was never a great actor and this was not his best work, Yes the ""martial arts"" are weak at best, but I still own this movie and watch it just to see Raul Julia go over the top.Why do they still call me a warlord? And mad? All I want to do is to create the perfect genetic soldier. Not for power, not for evil, but for good. Carlos Blanka will be the first of thousands. They will march out of my laboratory and crush every adversary, every creed, every nation! Until the world is in the loving grip of the Pax Bisonica. And peace will reign and all humanity will bow to me in humble gratitude."
1,writers? what writers?,"I watched this movie with the directors commentary and it is obvious that the director had no clue what Street Fighter is and it's clear that he never studied up on it. He admits that he wrote the script to the entire movie in less than a half an hour. If you listen to him he mispronounces half of the characters names. This director should have been the star of the movie ""Clueless."" I mean, Blanka is Guile's friend Charlie? Carlos Blanka??? Give me a break! I hope a BETTER director picks up Street Fighter because if it's done RIGHT it would make for a great movie."
3,USA Networks Version,"Okay so many of you probably have never seen this series. The quality of the DVD is great. But of course, this is the series that was on USA Networks on cable. Do not get this series mixed up with the Japanese version of Street Fighter.There are major differences. The first one is storyline is based on the horrid Van Damn movie of Street Fighter. Which means that the Street Fighters are police under cover to save the universe. Second difference is Guile is the main character not Ryu!I would consider this for my collection regardless. ADV Films bought the rights to this movie attempting to capture the Robotech, Transformers generation. They did a great job of marketing it to them. I ended up buying this DVD. It's not the best anime nor is it even Japanese, but I had to get it since I watched it growing up as a kid.15 episodes for $...? I figured its cheap enough to watch."
3,Cheesy but actually enjoyable,"Lots of people hate this movie and bemoan how bad the adaptation was. I've played a few Street Fighter games (for the SNES) so I could see the differences, but they didn't really bother me. Maybe it's because I'm not a die-hard SF fan, or maybe because I know that movie adaptations can never be exactly the same as their sources. Raul Julia (Gomez Addams from the Addams Family movies) does a decent job as M. Bison, you can see that he actually enjoyed playing his role. The film is campy and cheesy in parts, but if you don't hold too high expectations and just sit back and relax, you can actually enjoy this film."
4,Better than the Legend of Chun Li movie.,Obviously this movie has its faults but its quite campy and fun to watch than the Legend of Chun Li flick.
3,Er...I liked it...,"I know you must think I'm a real idiot to have liked this movie,but that's the truth.Sure,the storyline wasn't anything special,but the director had some skills,and the actor that played Bison was great.Also,you must admit,the movie had smart dialogues.I mean,you remember the funny quotes in the movie,right?Right?Ok,I'll shut up now. :)"
2,Van Dissapointment,"After Van Damme set sail in Timecop,a box-office smash his career was exactly where it needed to be.I thought only his flicks could get better,but after Streetfighter I thought differently.He should of let Stallone take the job,just like Judge Dredd,Streetfighter is a video game movie type disaster.Van Dammes acting was rusty and his fight scenes looked like special effect errors that needed to be edited.Now with it on DVD the price makes the movie look great,but in reality it's garbage.I personally love Van Dammes hard hitting action flicks,and I ain't putting him down personally but this movie has serious problems and a headache of a storyline."
2,One Word.BORING!,This movie is boring.I feel like falling asleep when I watch this movie.The fights are long and short at the same time.They got the wrong people to play these great characters.I am very dissapointed!
1,What the heck?,"I remember watching this when it first came out, I was maybe 6 or 7 at the time. Because of my obsession to the award winning video game, I rented the movie. I brought it home and I watched, I thought it was the BEST movie in the world. A few days ago, I remembered back to this movie, and I remembered how much I had loved it as a kid, so I went and bought it. Unfortunaltly when I watched it, my reaction was VERY different from the one I had six years ago. I probably enjoyed the movie so much at the time because I was young and I didn't know how to critique movies. Well, now, six years later, this is my opinion, if you want a true blue authentic Street Fighter movie, go rent, or even buy, Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie. Or even better, buy the unedited Japanese version with English subtitle. I don't even think this ""live-action"" version of the movie deserved a 1 star rating, maybe a .05."
1,not to well,man i tell you.i see alot of problems in this movie.i can make a better street figher.thats to whoever produced this movie and directed this movie.
2,THIS WORKED OUT A LOT BETTER IN THE VIDEO GAMES,"AN ARMY COLONEL [VAN DAMME] MUST TAKE ACTION AGAINST A RUTHLESS DICTATOR [RAUL JULIA] WHO HAS KIDNAPPED INNOCENT PEOPLE AND HELD THEM FOR RANSOM. THIS MOVIE, WHICH IS BASED ON THE VIDEO GAMES OF THE SAME NAME, IS VERY UNEVEN. VAN DAMME ACTUALLY MAKES A GREAT CHOICE FOR THE ROLE OF COL. GUILE. BUT RAUL JULIA LOOKS OUT OF PLACE AS BISON. MUCH OF THE MOVIE IS POINTLESS AND BORING. MOST OF THE ACTION IS CORNY AND MUCH OF THE ACTING IS BAD. I SHOWED A LITTLE MERCY ON THIS MOVIE BECAUSE OF ITS GOOD FINALE. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THIS WAS ONE CORNY ACTION FLICK. I THINK THIS STUFF WORKED OUT A LOT BETTER IN THE VIDEO GAMES. VAN DAMME AND RAUL JULIA ARE THE SOLE SAVIORS OF THIS MOVIE. THIS WAS RAUL JULIA'S LAST MOVIE. RAUL DIED IN 1995."
3,The worst movie that I had to buy,Street Fighter the movie is probobly one of the worst movies ever made. It is for this reason that I couldn't resist buying it. Everything about this movie is so over the top that it is at least worth watching once. If your in the right mind set it can be very intertaining but don't expect any serious acting or any hardcore action it this film. If you haven't seen it you should at least rent it.
2,WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!,"I know it was probably meant to be a spoof of Street Fighter II but it wasn't even that funny! As far as action goes, it was garbage! Even the Mortal Kombat films were funnier than this PLUS it had good action!If you want to see a good Street Fighter film, please get the Animated movie! True, some will like this one anyway but I believe if its going to be a spoof, at least make it funny. This wasn't neither exciting nor humorous in my opinion."
3,STREET FIGHTER - - COLLECTOR'S EDITION,"Have anybody encounter any problem with this DVD ? All the new generation DVD PLAYER including THE HIGH END MODEL , can't play this title .My old PIONEER PLAYER can only play this title . I recently bought a new copy but the problem still the same .STREET FIGHTER suppose to be a big hit for VAN DAMME but end up being the biggest flop movie . Director STEVEN E.DESOUZA seem have lost his direction . Even the anime is much better than the live action . Why can't they shoot this movie with a serious script , minus the comedy part & made the action scene more reliastic . IS A LIVE ACTION MOVIE , NOT AN ANIME MOVIE ."
2,street fighter,"Street fighter is a bad film! In the original story,Ryu and Kenwere the main characters.In this film,Guile,a military grunt withan impressive reputation,takes the lead.Most of the actors for chosen for the roles of the fighters are perfect for the parts. Blanka was not perfect.Too bad it was not a CGI CHARACTER.I betthat if it was made by someone who was competent, it would be a better film with a better script."
2,Blashphmy,What were the writers smoking? If you're a fan of Van Dam see this movie by all means. If you're a Fan or the Games and are famular with the True plot AVIOD. Don't touch this film with a 90 foot pole. Stay as far away as possible.Just remember this is not representation of the True Street Fighter games. for that check out the Anime Versions.other wise an ok action film.I hated it though.
2,Horrible Adaptation,"Street Fighter had good action but the plot and the acting was terrible. I played the Super NES version of the game and the movie's plot doesn't match the plot from the video game. What were the writers thinking?! This has got to be Jean-Claude Van Damme and Ming-Na Wen's most embarassing film that they ever acted in! One star for action and another for fighting but it does not give you much of the action movie experience. If you want to see a real action movie, try watching James Bond movies, The Rock, Gladiator, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or The Matrix. Those can give you real action other than this almost horrible movie."
1,wheres the bucket at,"jesus who ever has been giving this film 5 stars must be on crack this was the most worst Martial Arts action film I ever saw, this makes Mortal Kombat Anihilation seem better"
2,It's not a total loss,"<Every year, a oscar-worthy movie comes along that renews our faith in the American spirit and makes us want to stand up for what we believe in.> This isn't one of them!It's not the action sequences or the acting that bothered me. It was the plot; a military showdown between Col. Guile (Van Damme)and Gen. Bison (Raul Julia). Maybe if it were an actual street fighter tournament hosted by Bison, maybe it could've been better. It would certainly put Van Damme in his element. But like I said, it wasn't a total loss. The ziggers in the movie were hilarious, it had a popular cast and Raul Julia portrays a tryanical madman very well. If you have cable, you can see it on USA or the SCI-FI channel. Otherwise, I would skip this one. Oh, by the way, Ming-Na Wen from Mulan is in this movie."
2,Capcom you lose,"If you are expecting this movie to be like the game, don't buy this movie. I recommend watching the Animated Movie instead. The only reason I rented the movie was to see Ming-na play Chun-li. The plot? What plot? The dialogue was cheesyx10, and the fight scenes weren't all that."
1,GACCCCCCCCCCCCCK,"Terrible movie, bottom lineI guess this 'could' be enjoyable for kids but anyone that was a fan of the Street Fighter video games will be revolted at this hideous piece of work. I watched this with friends when we had a 'Bad Movie Night' and I suppose it has SOME merit when used for that purpose, but it was so poor I don't know if I could even watch it again for that reason.* NOT RECOMMENDED"
1,DEAR GOD NO ....,"I was a teen in the 1990's and I watched ""MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000"" and loved it because the films where so bad , they where good (funny) ... This peace of $#!t would have been right at home there !Only watch if your :HIGHDRUNKLOOKING FOR SOMETHING STUPID TO WATCHOR ALL OF THE ABOVE .THANK YOU!"
4,Guilty Pleasure,As a 37 year old man (as of this writing) I grew up with SF and MC and all those other wonderful games turned HORRIBLE movies. This one is no different. It is SO CHEESEY and filled with cliches and abysmal acting. All that said I LOVE THIS MOVIE! It doesn't try to take itself seriously while not skimping on the action and martial arts. It is more like Power Rangers meet Street Fighter martial arts cheese but it completes my childhood so it MUST BE OWNED!
4,myth and magic,"i recommend this book not only to fantasy art lovers but also to tokien fans, since most of the movie costumes and scenery were inspired by john howe's piantings"
4,Long live the 80's,"I was a huge Turtles fan as a kid and this movie is even better than I remember it. It's low budget and cheesy, but it's ca'mon...it's FUN! It's also a lot more grown up than I would've thought (the second movie caters more to the wee 'uns that flocked to see this movie.) The martial arts scenes are a lot cooler than the fancy-shmancy Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon stuff, the Turtles seem like a group of frat guys you know, and it just feel good to cheer for the good guys. The dark side is easy to hate, too. Too many modern day villains are little wimps: the Shredder's got villainous fortitude.My gripes: the DVDs features are better than some, but really...no behind the scenes stuff, no cut scenes? If you have it on VHS, you're not missing a whole lot. The movie's costumes are a little cheesy and the acting is what you'd expect, but...so what? If you were a Turtles fan, you need to see this movie."
4,a really cool movie thats better with Casey Jones,i think it is really good movie that actually impressed me this is a really good trail from the eights and DartKick and i both think this is a great movie if you are an adult or a fid you will not be dissapoint
3,teenage mutant ninja turtles the origional dvd movie,the movie is good it was like new like it said plays like a regular dvd movie ive seen it several times on my laptop on my xbox360 it plays good is not damaged is not scratched it was all new what Imazed me was that when i open it it was small little disks not the origional dvd disks they wear special i was shocked i was ammazed dint know it was actually going to work on my laptop or on my xbox360 concel But it did! thanks Amazon once again for sending me such an Amazing Small Mini Disk and it Still Plays Like an origional Movie thanks once again :)
4,teenage turtles,Ireally liked this movie and glad to get it on DVD. The Dvd was in good shape and played well.
3,Turtle Fun but Lose the *#%@#,"This is fun to watch and has all the action and tongue in cheek fun of the series - however, I cringed everytime a turtle murmured a curse! My kids love the turtles, but this one is going on a shelf for a while. Admitedly, the cursing is pretty tame, but the turltes attract a pretty young crowd. So stick with the cartoons if you aren't interested in hearing your kid's heros say a four letter word every five minutes."
2,The second movie is better ! !,"Well, I watched this movie when it came out at the movie theaters when I was 5 years old and own the VHS taped. I still say this movie was slow and old. I didn't like the scenes in the movie nor the settings. The story was lame as well. First it deals with Raph losing one of his ""Sai"" weapons during a fight and April has one of the two he owns. Then he goes out and searches for it and blah, blah, they kidnap Splinter, blah, blah, the Foot Clan are a bunch of teenagers, blah, blah, fight the Sherdder end of movie. The second movie was way better and more into the 90's. The thrid movie just stunk !"
4,goofy but he liked it,"The movie is a little much for me, but my Grandson loves TMNT. Perfect gift for a little one that loves these things."
4,WOW!,"Not many things in this world can bring such a plethora of emotions from deep within the crevices of my soul like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the Movie! SPOILER ALERT: This movie is AWESOME!! It's all funny and then sometimes its all like sad and then sometimes its all like ""F*&% you, Shredder! Why you gotta do that to Splinter!"" Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone with a face and the mental capacity to feel. Ebert and Rupert said this movie was a ""Cowabunga good time!"" If you don't buy this movie you've done yourself and your posterity a terrible disservice and have probably brought upon an old Japanese curse to your household. Buy this movie, you bass-turd."
3,The Turtles film debut,"The turtles make their movie debut in this live action movie. The movie is a more serious and darker than that of the cartoon that was out at the time of the time of the movie was released in theatres to please at least the older fans of the turtles. While some of the elements of the movie was borrowed from the show though the movie premise followed the original comics that was released in 1984. The main villain is of course, the Shredder which most turtle fans are most familiar with and seen in pretty much every episode of the original show, though in the movie he seems to be a little more sinister then compared to the show version of him. I feel that this movie did the turtle franchise good, even if it was a independent movie, it was a good deal for the turtles, although I never would've thought that Corey Feldman from Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter done the voice for Donnie. Overall I give this movie 3.5 stars out of 5."
4,Cowabunga and a narley movie....but bogus bonus stuff dude,"This is one of those movies that I think has just been misstreaded when beeing put on DVD. The movie is great, but there are no bonus materials :(Ever since the film came out, we always wondered where that scene was that shows up on the trailer? a scene where the turtles are in the water, and there shells pop up... so with this DVD i was hoping there would be deleted scenes to satasfy that curiosity? But sadly, there isnt even a featurette:(And i know they made featurettes, i remember clearly all those years ago a guy punching in things on a key bourd, and the robotic head of Raphial it was hooked into was moving the facial features around.... so where are those features???For this decent price, its ok. The sewer game is forgetable, might occupy you for a few minutes?! But i'm very disapointed that there is no bonus features with this great ninja comedy."
5,Cool movie!,"The comic book and cartoon heroes come to life.Back when this movie first came out I was like 5 or 6,so I loved the Ninja Turtles from watching the cartoon and having the action figures.The movie is still enjoyable,even though I am now 19.The characters were develped very well,and the movie does a good job introducing the story of how the turtles came what they are.Besides the turtles and splinter,there is also Casey Jones and the Shredder of course.The movie is dark,made where it can be appealing to adults as well as children.The DVD version of the film is pretty cool!The picture in nice quality,not grainy,and you have your choice of viewing it full screen or wide screen.The sound quality is pretty good too.A real bargain and a real treat for Turtle fans."
5,Ruled,"how many times can you see mutant NINJA turtles kick the butts of highly trained henchmen? Not many, but you can here!!! this movie was awesome, like most others, it's the best out of the flock(between the first second and third) if you like mutants, fight scenes, and some comedy, this is the movie for you!"
4,TMNT did it for me.,TMNT were a blast. something new to share withthe kids. Beyyer than the cartoon which came later. My kids enjoyed it every time its played.
1,Needs Special Edition!!!! Not a re-release!!,"This movies gets a 5/5, but not the dvd. Recently Steve Barron (director) offered materials for a special edition, but Warner bros wasn't interested! It's almost the 25th anniversary of TMNT and because they're ""not interested"" they re-release the same old garabage in a 25th anniversary packaging! If anyone cares about this movie join me and stop buying warner bros dvds!!!!"
5,The Single Greatest Movie Ever Made,"Simply put, this is the greatest movie ever made in the history of cinema. No joke. It is beautifully shot, especially the training montage at April's abandoned farm. The action scenes are spectacular without the use of any special effects. And, there is a seriously complex plot involving a lot of complex human/turtle/rat emotions which explores themes of family, loyalty and love, all within the confines of a classic coming-of-age story surrounding four brothers who happen to be mutated turtle ninjas. Oh yeah, it's also HILARIOUS and one of the most quotable movies I have ever seen.Buy this movie right now.Seriously.Do it.Buy it.It's awesome."
5,Turtles work just as well live as animated.,"Can you believe that a man in a incredibly weighted turtle suit could kick you in the head, if you dont you better watch this movie cause you'll be very surprised. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was more than just a cute flick for the kiddies and gamers. Not only did it introduce a new era of filmaking it proved that even mutated turtles have their rough days. It includes a brilliant cast of turtles (Raphael's performance was as worthy of an oscar as Tom Hanks in Apollo 13), also a great ensemble of teenage roughnecks, Casey Jones a sports equipment wielding physco, and a totally hot red haired reporter by the name of April O'Neal. So check it out."
3,Reviewing the DVD not the movie,"I think this DVD should be digitally remastered. Watching this DVD on a 64"" TV with Dolby surround sound you can really pick out the flaws. The sound is a good quallity I would say 4 out of 5. The picture quality is terrible and I mean really bad. It seems that it was just transfered from VHS directly onto DVD. Anyway I was very disappointed. If you are thinking of buying this DVD I would wait until it is rereleased."
5,awesome,my kids love it which is nice cause i grew up watching them too. everychild should try the old movies and cartoons
4,"Great, But The Cream Filling",This is a great movie but the references are getting a little old. They are like from the 80s. Otherwise watching turtles running around with swords is very interesting.
3,The best of the movies by far,"This live action version of Ninja Turtles is from 1990 but I'm still amazed by the costumes. Critics hated the movie of course but I think it deserves some respect. It looks great with life like costumes. It can be cheesey and corny but the sequels were cheesier and cornier. This one is darker and more violent but also more entertaining and smart. With a new animated movie coming out, I ask if we really need it when this one was already a faithful and well made adaption."
5,I love this movie and 2 and 3!!!!,Ok this movie is great especailly that they didn't fight outside in the daytime!!! they fought in buildings or on rooftops at night. at least the shredder wasn't wearing teeny tiny pieces of armor like the original cartoon actually that was stupid and he wore red everywhere (ok in the movie he didn't wear that much armor but it covered more spots than the show!!!) in the show it was here and there but in the movie it was here over there and over there too.
5,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles [Blu-ray],Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an amazing movie. On blu-ray the picture quality is perfect i suggest any TMNT fans to get this blu-ray.
4,go turtles,my 4 yr old loves them and I love that. if I have to write more I will not review any more
4,All data at a glance,"This wireless cycling computer has a nice display that gives you all the data at a glance. It was easy to setup, although I don't care much for the lap-time feature. I had to call VETTA for instructions how to reset the counters to Zero after a ride (the information is missing in the user manual that comes with it). Overall very satisfied with this product so far."
2,Fails in many ways!,"I just lost this computer today for the last time. I searched for it in the weeds for about 20 mins then finally gave up. It never attached to the bike properly, and within 100 miles the sensor unit snapped apart rendering the entire device useless until I remedied the situation with some zip-ties. I would save up a few more bucks and get something nicer. I did love the style and look and even the features but it's a very unrealiable piece of equipment. Buttons seemed cheap as well and I often had a hard time clearing the memory out for the next ride. Good luck if you get this one. Sorry Vetta."
1,Didn't work- but have had prompt help,"I've been cycling for years- and have installed plenty of these kinds of gadgets on a multitude of bikes. This one didn't work.After carefully reading the manual and buying and changing the batteries, and reinstalling multiple times I came to the conclusion that the sensor was not working. Have emailed Vetta and the retailer. Both have replied; Vetta sent some information and the seller has offered to send me a new sensor at their expense. I rate both for getting back to me promptly, and I hope this fixes the problem. Overall a but frustrating, but gratifying that they are actively helping fix the problem."
4,Good budget wireless bike computer,"I bought this computer because it is wireless and you can see MPH, odometer and time all at the same time. The wireless works well. I question the accuracy of the computer. It seems off at high speeds. Also, the readout has a 3-4 second delay. So when you change speeds, the computer takes a few seconds to update the display. My wired cateye does not seem to have this problem. For a serious competitor, I think you would want to spend a little more. But for recreational biking it works fine."
1,Don't buy this cycling computer,"I liked the features of this bike computer, but when I turn on my Cateye HL-EL830RC Triple Shot Pro the computer goes crazy, displaying random high speeds in 50 - 70 MPH ranges. Same thing happened while passing under some high voltage power lines."
2,"Not a bad card in itself, but AC adapter was defective","The card itself works well, and delivers fast USB 2.0 transfer rates. However, the AC adapter on the card I bought (which I needed in order to be able to use an external hard drive) was physically defective; it wouldn't stay plugged into the power port on the card. I returned it and bought another one, we'll have to see how that one works."
1,random outtakes,"if someone took random outtakes from the cutting room floor of various Japanese movies - then glued them together - it would resemble this film - there is no apparent connection between the scenes - except for their tediumit reminds me of a scene in the Japanese film SUMMER TIME MACHINE BLUES - where a movie ticket seller clad in a Star Trek uniform - tries to convince a young man to see a C-level scifi film by bragging that ""it's really boring!"" - this coulda been the film they were talking about"
2,Common trees of Puerto Rico and the Virgin islands.,"The lack of illustrations makes the book useless to me. The technical content is good, but it should be stated in the offer on Amazon that it is a learned tome and not a field guide."
1,Complete waste,"This Squibs video is terrible. The cartoon is very poorly done. It doesn't explain the topics well. You can't even really understand what they are trying to explain. A much better choice would be: Greatest Discoveries With Bill Nye: Earth Sciences. Bill Nye's video was excellent with amazing graphics, interviews with experts, and clear detailed explanations. This Squibs video is a waste of time."
5,Entertaining Book,"Johnny Fletcher and his sidekick Sam Cragg are locked out of their apartment room for non-payment of rent. If that's not bad enough, when they illegally enter the room to get some belongings, they notice a body that they didn't leave there... These mysteries from the early part of this century (somewhere around the 1930 or 40s) are just plain fun to read."
5,Reckless and groovy latin jazz!!,"Disclaimer--I sing the lead vocals on this album, and Wayne Wallace is my producer--but I can still say that the tunes are full of fire and the band grooves through Wallace's intricate arrangements with deceptive ease. You'll find irresistable salsa, an Ellingtonian bolero and a quintessential classic of latin jazz here--plus much more. Relax and enjoy!"
5,Marlene Dietrich: The Glamour Collection,"This is a great collection of Marlene Dietrich movies from early 30s to early 40s. First of all, Universal didn't do a good job on putting this set out. First, the last disk is double sided but there isn't anything on the other side while the other side has Golden Earrings. Second, the case's sleeve artwork just has an image of Marlene but doesn't have any writing on the front to indicate what movies are on there. Overall this is a great set of movies and I would recommend it.As for the movies, the quality of them are pretty good. All movies in this set are in B&W; and are in Full frame format.""Morocco"" (1930/92mins)-Gary Cooper & Marlene Dietrich""Blood Venus"" (1932/94mins)-Marlene Dietrich, Cary Grant & Herbert Marshall""The Devil is a Woman"" (1935/80mins)-Marlene Dietrich & Lionel Atwill""The Flame of New Orleans"" (1941/79mins)-Marlene Dietrich, Bruce Cabot & Roland Young""Golden Earrings"" (1947/96mins)-Ray Milland & Marlene Dietrich"
5,Marlene,This is a very good collection or 'Marlene Dietrich's' movies. This collection is something all Marlene fans will enjoy I am very pleased with it.
5,Legend,Who hasn't heard of Marlene Dietrich? Not anyone who has paid attention to anything other than modern movies. These are not her greatest movies-still I feel the vast majority of viewers will be very glad they have this set.
2,Only plays in DVD will not play on your computer,"The film quality is decent. However, the discs will not play on my computer. This is a huge negative for me. If you just want a bunch of films for a low price and only plan on watching them on your DVD player then this collection is for you. However, there are more expensive DVD versions of these films here on amazon."
1,"Great Films,.. Awful Packaging!!",Very Dissapointed in the quality of these dvd transfers..Can't the heirs (Maria Riva) do something about this?? A true crime for loyal fans..
1,Too cheap to function set,"It's great that these films are available, some good ones (Morocco) some bad ones (Golden Earrings) some in good condition (The Devils Is a Woman) some barely watchable. But in any case this set is so cheaply done that mine stopped being able to be read in any dvd device after less than a year. 4 movies crammed onto just 1 dvdcan't be a good thing. Better to buy the individual dvd's available in europe than this piece of crap."
5,Glamour Personified: Marlene Dietrich,Marlene Dietrich IS glamour. There were other stars more beautiful and/or sexier but La Dietrich may be the queen when it comes to glamour. The visual care that went in to her films was almost unprecedented and Dietrich herself knew as much about how to best present her on the screen as any director or cinematographer. This set has five Dietrich classics but my personal favorite is the elegant romantic comedy THE FLAME OF NEW ORLEANS which is vastly underrated.
2,Marlene Dietrich: The Glamour Collection (Morocco/ Blonde Venus/ The Devil Is a Woman/ Flame of New Orleans/ Golden Earrings),"Well the product presentation is poor, let's hope the DVD's aren't of such quality. will review again after i watch the films. check the pictures of the set as received. btw, i'm not rating the content yet. this is about the physical ""collection"" per se. Not cool."
1,Did not play in my computer,"This compilation disc of Marlene Deitrich's movies may be great, but it does not play in my (Apple) computer here in Nepal. I will have to get a refund when I return. However, in the meantime, I will try other machines. This is a shame because I was really looking forward to the films."
2,A Puzzlement,"My question is why Universal has clumped these films under the banner of ""The Franchise Collection"" Ditto the Deanna Durbin films. A franchise is a group of films that are in essence related sequels-think Ma & Pa Kettle, Andy Hardy, Tarzan, Charlie Chan etc. A stars' output is not necessarily a franchise. There has to be a story relation not just the same star"
1,What is up with this product?,"I rented from Blockbuster, and the first disc available was ""Disc 2"" which looks possibly double sided, but only has Golden Earrings on one side. Arguably this is not Dietrich's best early film, but my question is about the ""Collection."" From reading other reviews it sounds like 4 movies are on a double-sided disc called ""Disc 1."" Is this the case?Neither the Amazon listing or Blockbuster make this explicit at all, and it is rather important. I would think there is only one release with two discs (split as above), but this is not clear from the reviews here though they have been very helpful in figuring things out.The quality of ""Disc 2"" at least is poor as others have noted about the collection, however getting these movies only available on VHS now on DVD was a major attraction.Could someone please clarify what this collection (presumably one edition only)consists of (number of discs, titles), perhaps with an ISBN number, at long last?"
1,bad luck or bad service?,"I never received the purchased items. I've sent you an email regarding this ""loss"". You did not answer my email with complaint."
5,My absolute favorite floss,"My dentist recommended this. It feels more like cloth than regular floss, and stretches to get in between small spaces. I feel that my teeth are much cleaner with this and get annoyed if I run out and have to use regular floss which just seems to push stuff around instead of lifting it out. Our local stores don't carry this anymore so I bought a lot online."
4,fun game once you know how to play,"Most of the negative reviews I've seen on this game were people complaining about the complicated rules. It is a bit complicated, but you should be able to get the hang of it after playing once or twice. It is pretty much a mix of Clue and Monopoly."
2,"Great concept, bad playabilty","Although the story behind the game is well thought out, play testing of the game itself seems lacking. Due to the rules of the game, it is difficult to amass the requirements to move onto the final passage of the game. We found that we were spending round after round rolling the dice, unable to further ourselves in the game. We all had determined the hidden item, but could not progress further- either because of lack of treasure or financial requirements. The game has a ""trading mechanism"", but there seemed to be little or no incentive. The first hour of the game was fun, collecting treasures and discoving the cards. The remainder of the game, over 3 hours, was bland. We were very disappointed with the game overall.If you plan on buying this game, it could be fun with altered rules. Our group (4 adults) found that we were so unimpressed with the game that we were unwilling to invest our time in it again."
5,CONSTANTGAMEPLAYER,"WADJET HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST ENTERTAINING GAMES AND EDUCATIONAL I HAVE COME ACROSS IN YEARS. HOURS OF FUN FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS GENUINELY ORIGINAL GAME, TO ALL."
5,spectacular does not even begin to describe,"This is, quite possibly, the best game ever. I also recommend playing with at least four people and my friends and I have found that playing as teams is also fun if you have more than four players. Not only is this game incredibly engaging, it also gives the players plenty of opportunities to interact with each other. There are ways to develop and act on grudges (especially fun if you have a vindictive streak...), team up with one player against another... It's fantastic and impossible to describe in under 1,000 words. But I'm going to go there with one of those horrible statements that I generally hate: ""If you like the game Clue, you'll love this game."" It's much more complicated and 'adult,' but a lot of the objectives and basic ideas are the same. I recommend it to everyone I know."
2,Not very impressed,"I was really looking forward to receiving this game and was very disappointed once I got it. The pages and pages of rules and exceptions were not organized and were very confusing and complicated. I don't mind taking the time to learn a new game, but entire topics were missing and we would have to make up many rules as we played. Too much emphasis on pictures, symbols and the 'story' and not enough on the basics of a good game."
4,High production values make this game a classy gift!,"Wadjet was named the ""Best Looking Game"" of 1998 in the Buyer's Guide of the now defunct ""The Games Annual"" magazine. ""Huge, lavishly illustrated busy board...packaged in a very large, impressive box. And the playing pieces are four very different, intricately detailed, plaster busts three inches tall!...You could give it as a gift without even wrapping it."
1,mike's comments,"I found wadjet to be rather irritating to play. There are just too many trivial tasks and writing that you need to perform for each turn. There is not much challenge or thinking involved in it (once you have read the incredibly detailed instructions) - just mindless repetition of tasks.In addition, if you try to play with 2 or 3 players then the logistics do not work very well and you end up with too many cards in the wrong plaaces."
2,yuck.,"Hi, i'm from nashville and have been a fan of the teen idols for a while, but since they found this new singer, they suck and they broke up soon after. I love all of their work when keith, the old singer was still in the band because he really added fire to the band. one of the last shows i saw was right before he left and it ended with keith ripping his shirt off and fighting some rednex who got too violent in the pit. anyway, this cd sorta sounds like them, but if you're just listening to them for the first time, try out pucker up or any of the others."
2,Lost cause,"This is the Idols final cd and lets just say they didn't go out with a bang. The new singer isn't bad but he's nowhere near the singer that Keith was. In general the cd is slower than their old stuff and has flat out less energy. By the off chance if you are just starting to listen to the Teen Idols don't buy this cd first, start with Pucker Up."
3,"beautiful watch, but....","This is a very nice watch all silver with little color accents and engraving, but it broke. The spring that winds up popped after about 3 months and stopped working. So no big deal, lifetime warranty, right? Wrong, I have sent the watch out for repair four times, and each time it comes back with something new wrong with it. The hands hit each other and make the watch stop, or if you lay it on the desk, it just randomly starts and stops. Anyways, I'm going to send it out one last time with a lengthy letter, and lets hope I get a working watch out of it."
2,Befriend a Jeweler!,I have had this watch for six months and had to repair it twice so far. The mechanism jams and the watch will not work. A watch maker has to open and unjam it. To completely fix it will cost more than the value of the watch. Apparently the main spring can break if you overwind it.
4,Strangely Compelling Story With An Amazing Soundtrack,"Lili Taylor and Guy Pearce are totally convincing as two eccentric characters struggling with loneliness and longing for a different life than their sleepy Southern town has offered them so far.A few interesting plot twists and amazing music make up for the areas where the film falters. The supporting characters are a bit cliched and the framework wasn't always fully laid down for the viewer to understand the character's motivations.However, I do feel this film is underappreciated. Pearce and Taylor's realization of these characters surpasses the minor flaws. Guy Pearce manages a Jim Morrison-esque sexiness and impressive vocals in the musical sequences. I also highly recommend the Soundtrack album for this film."
2,Diggin' up a demon,"Nope,this isn't the male-bonding Coast Guard film starring Kevin Costner&Ashton; Kutcher.It's Mario Van Peebles as a Gulf War veteran who must fight an evil unleashed during that conflict (yes,a demon named Tlal who was imprisoned for 3000 yrs,but was inadvertently freed)There's the ""Chaos"" drug,dirty cops,and a little boy prophet named David.The plot has more holes than Swiss cheese.There are slow-motion battle scenes,and Van Peebles' female counterpart looks&dresses; like Trinity,Neo's girlfriend in the Matrix trilogy.Poor Mario spends most of the movie baffled-until he gets possessed by Tlal.The boy prophet David from Iraq (who's supposed to bring unity between Muslims and Christians) says the magic words,Mario falls from a great height to his death,destroying the demon,and his wife awakens from near-death.Huh?Did I miss something?Oh yeah,the plot."
2,Adrienne Rich has gone soft,"Rich has gone soft! She cares more for causes, race and gender of the authors than she does for quality. There are about 3 and a half strong poems in the collection, which is the worst edition of Best American Poetry by far."
2,Disappointing,"Too many of the poems in this anthology are rambling and artless -- just plain bad. There are some worthy exceptions. ""The Prisoner of Camau"" by Henry Hart and ""Reading Aloud to My Father"" by Jane Kenyon come immediately to mind. Are the six or seven stellar poems in this anthology worth the price of admission? Perhaps. Adrienne Rich took a lot of chances with this collection. A pity so few of them were worthwhile."
1,Wish I could give it less than 1 star....,"Fundamentally, this is the dullest, least interesting collection of poetry I've ever seen. And it's deeply hypocritical of Rich as well; her own poetry reveals a woman who is aware not only of feminist and multicultural criticism, but who is also well-versed in the strengths and mysteries poetry can offer. ..................... There isn't a single piece worth reading in the entire book."
1,disappointing,"It seems like cultural and gender identities are becoming more important than literature itself when it comes to literary criticism. I am very concerned about people who sees this anthology as a victory of the feminists and the multiculturalists over the so called 'predominantly white male society'. It is disappointing to see that even this prestigious anthology would fall into the victim of feminism and multiculturalism, because it is one of the few anthologies out there that offers some genuine poetry."
3,A paradox,This book had interesting parts and some very dull parts. There was too much ink wasted on small details that were boring and contributed little to the overall story.
2,A few interesting facts buried in a mass of acronyms,"A pretty dry read, one for the conspiracy theorists only, I feel. Perhaps the NSA got to this author too, since after the first 100 pages we had already been introduced to about 150 acronyms, plenty of mini-biographies of the many NSA staffers involved and virtually no interesting facts. A recent article in the IHT said that the amount of intercepts each day could fit into a block 20 yards wide and 10 yards high. If you imagine how much must have been produced since the early 1950s it is very disappointing to find none of it in the book."
3,Good reading for those who find cryptology interesting,The author has attempted to expand on his knowledge of cryptology in the Navy with a lot of imagination to round out the intreging subject. The book was removed from circulation for a while by a government agency due to some of the information contained in the book.
3,Time Passed By.,"When this book came out in the early 80s it was the first thoroughly researched and non sensationalist treatment of our most obscure intelligence agency. Though it is now history and no longer current events. It still stands up as a reference but much has been revealed and released to the National Archives by the NSA since. Still valuable but not indispensible. Bamford's latest work on the same subject was done with much cooperation with the NSA directors of the last few years. Since the changes in cryptography and the end of the Cold War, this book has been overtaken by events."
2,The Puzzle Palace : A Report on America's Most Secret Agency,"This book was written almost 20 years ago. Any information in here is good from a historical standpoint, and you may get an idea of what the direction was, but that is about it. If you want to get an idea of what the NSA is doing today, this isn't the book for you."
5,A little paranoid...,"I don't know if this is true, but I heard that if you purchase this book ANYWHERE, your name and everything about you goes into some kind of NSA list..."
5,Big Brother is WATCHING and LISTENING!,"I read this book in hardback when it first came out, long before the WWW was even existed. It became the basis of my concerns about government servilance of our personal electronic communications.If the general public ( Or as Julius Cesear called them "" The ignorent masses"" )read this book, they would understand the mockery the US government has made of the basic liberties our forefathers and our brothers and sisters have fought and died for.If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's `Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, checkout Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban."
2,"The only comprehsenive study of the NSA, but poorly written.","If you want information on the NSA, this is one of the few books you'll find. So, in a sense, you have no choice but to read this book and the sequel. Unfortunately, Bamford needs to learn how to write. Chapters are chaotic. Miscellaneous information is peppered throughout. Run-on sentences and poor choice of verb tenses are only some of the grammatical problems that make this a difficult read. The book is a rough draft. In addition, although Bamford tries to be ""objective"", it seems clear that he wouldn't have obtained this information if he was critical of the NSA."
5,Arbuckle: One of the greatest comedians of all!!,"This man should be immortalized in the top echelon of the 3 or 4 greatest comedians of all time, right up there with Keaton (his protege), Chaplin (part of the Keystone family) and Lloyd! So inventive, so athletic, and by all accounts was a very nice man as well. I hope this wonderful collection will help get his star shining so brightly as he deserves; the horrible travesties dealt him need to be dimmed in the light of the joy and genius he brought to the world. :-)"
3,For your entertainment only,"If you're into Lovecraft, you should enjoy this tongue-in-cheek work, which Lovecraft wrote to entertain those who thought there might be some reality to ""the dreaded Necronomicon.""If you think the Necronomicon is *real* you should *definitely* read this, along with Lovecraft's letters and ample documentary evidence that the Necronomicon was a figment of Lovecraft's imagination.If you're into *real* evil, you would do better to read ""Mein Kampf"" by A. Hitler, but maybe it wouldn't be as entertaining as a fantasy of wickedness, knowing the ""real"" horrors it led to.Lovecraft was a thoroughgoing materialist. I wonder what he would have thought of those who find eldritch wisdom in a fictional work?"
2,For completeness only,"Very [inexpensive], but, ""you get what you pay for."" I have seen privately printed pamphlets of higher quality than this (I consider it no small coincidence that it comes as an 8.5 by 7 inch center-stapled booklet, or four 8.5x14 pages folded in half).I would, however, buy this even knowing the above, simply for the sake of completeness. I know of no other recent sources for this particular bit of Lovecraft lore."
3,Some Corections,The Necronomicon is not fiction for those who say that Lovecraft invented the Necronomicon do some research and you will find writtings about the Necronomicon that date back at least as far as the 18th century here are just a few titles for those who wish to checkLa Magie et la Divination chez les Chaldeo-Assyriennes;by LaurentScience Occult; La Magie chez les Chaldeens ; by Lenormantas you will see the last one was published in 1874 thus befor Lovecrafts birthJust a History lesson
4,Easy to Love,"Another of the classic series of lesbian literature, the Lex and Amanda series by Carrie Carr should be on every collector's bookshelf. I recently read and enjoyed - for the second time - the entire story. In this sequel to `Destiny's Bridge,' Lex and Amanda start to move forward with their relationship and have to deal with Amanda's homophobic parents in the process.Because of this wonderful series, Carrie Carr is one of the more widely-published authors in the genre. Lex and Amanda are easy to love and it's a joy to watch their relationship grow as the series develops."
3,"Okay, but too muddy and quiet","I found this recording frustrating, for example, on ""Funeral Ikos"" The Holst Singers are muddy, and there is too much `ring' from the recording venue. In addition, in an attempt to respect the quietude with which the piece begins, it is simply recorded at too low a volume. The King's College Choir, Cambridge/Stephen Cleobury recording on ""IKOS"" is superior."
5,Great mask,"This mask offers many great functions and capabilities.1. The flexibility of the mask make it comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.2. The Thermal lens actually does what it's supposed to. You can wear it for hours, and it won't fog up like more common masks. Very big selling point for anyone who's ever played with an inferior mask.3. Relatively cheap price make it very affordable with a very high quality to boot. The quality to price ratio is very good.JT generally makes good quality products at very affordable prices.Overall this is a great mask from beginners to intermediate players. Offers great protection and vision from beginning to the end. Highly recommended."
4,works with Sherwood A-965 amplifier,"great product... only 4 stars because I feel the plug could be a bit smaller, but 5 stars in my mind"
5,One of the great smooth jazz cds,Only one word can describe this cd: outstanding! It's an album you can kick back and listen to anytime. I only wish Mr. Sumner would get back in the studio and put out another one as good as his first two efforts. I am a true fan.
1,Very poor,When I first bought this online I was very excited all of that changed when I received it in the mail .The package was very small and I paid almost $10 for it .Plus the picture online dosen't even match what I recieved in the mail .Plus My hamster won't even eat it . Honestly I think this is the worst product I ever bought online and will never buy from this person again .
1,Somewhat accurate item description(s)-very inaccurate values,"I buy old drugstores, whether from individuals or at auction. This book is the poorest example of a ""pricing guide/valuation"" (whether it be at ""auction value"" or ""street value"") on drugstore items, collectibles, paraphenalia or whatever. It is very evident the authors have a very limited, unrealistic and deceptive ""feel for the market""."
1,soda fountain,"Have been collecting soda fountain material for 30 years and this is the poorest yet! Lists fantasy items as real, shows kitchen items as fountain related, save your money!"
5,Awesome book for nonmembers and members!,"This classic missionary book was first published in 1920, and has been the Restored Church of Christ's foremost novel for over eighty-one years. Its message is as real and convincing today as when it was first written.-Price Publishing's website description."
1,Chasing Spring by Bruce Stutz,"Interesting, but on page 92 the Four Corners area is listed as the meeting place of Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. This should be Colorado (not Nevada), Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Also on page 85 the author describes rock massifs that rise to 18,000`. Since Mt. Whitney is 14,505` and is the highest peak in the contiguous US I am wondering where these ""rock massifs"" are."
2,Return to sender,"I purchased this product through Amazon several weeks ago, and was very disappointed when it arrived. It is much lighter in color and weight than I expected. A nice necklace for a teenager but not bold enough for an adult. I have returned it for a full refund."
2,Too sticky/tacky,"Love the scent of this! But it's really sticky. I can't use it. When I talk, it doesn't feel natural...my lips stick together. So disappointed."
5,alternative perspectives,"Top level academic research from what might be called a ""european' perspective; interesting and challenging alternatives to the predominant positivism that has previously pervaded much of the entrepreneurship literature."
4,An academic defense of posttribulationism,"This is still the best apologetic for the posttribulation position I've read. I'm disappointed that there aren't more books on the posttribulational position out there. But Gundry does a good job at critiquing the popular pretribulational view and setting forth a solid exegetical defense of posttribulationism. His interpretation of John 14 is a little wrong. But other than that, it's really good."
3,not very good quality,The sound is not of a very high quality and Highway Song is actuallycut off in the beginning. Disappointing...
4,good 'ole Rock n Roll with a Southern edge,I have hearnd verious songs by these guys through the years and finally got this CD. I was amazed to find that they were the ones who wrote some of the songs that have been made famous by others like the Allman Bro.'s Good music and the second half Rocks!!
3,Decent ... could be better,Value for money CD.Has a good selection of songs but the CD could hv contained more - at least 5 more! Worth it if you are getting introduced to Blackfoot.
2,ONLY FOR THE MOST DIE HARD CORWELL FANS,"I read things about Cornwell and Ive read all of her books, lord help me...and frankly, there was nothing in this book I had not heard or read elsewhere and I'm hardly an expert on Cornwell. One piece of advice..if you have not read a certain book DONT read the synopsis of it in this book, it will ruin it for you, it's a real spoiler, eventhough ive read all the books, ive forgotten some of them and even I dont want to have the whole book explained to me. Really, I dont get the reason for this book, is it really necessary to have all the books broken down and a quick index of the characters, I mean if you've read her books, you know who all these people are and you know what the books are about, and Cornwell it not interesting at all, she's notoriously mysterious and prickly."
4,interesting bio,"Anyone interested in the life and works of Patricia Cornwell will definitely want to buy and immediately read THE UNOFFICIAL PATRICIA CORNWELL COMPANION. The first section is a mini-biography on the author, highlighting the high points of her life. Two interesting sub-sections are ""The Quotable Patricia Cornwell"" and a reprint of an interview with the author.Section II looks at the works of Patricia Cornwell with reviews of each book stating what the critical thought about each novel is. This is a treasure chest of information and shows that the author went two steps beyond a mini-synopsis to give the audience a feel for each novel. If there is one criticism of this novel, it is that there is no interview with the author specifically intended for this biography.Harriet Klausner"
3,"Ok, but didn't meet my needs","I purchased the Dummies book for Quicken 2006 mainly to handle my investments and bank accounts. I have Quicken Premier 2006. This book is poor for this purpose. It provided very limited information on these topics. In the end I had to work with the help documentation for my software. BTW, the software also has many deficiencies as well. My main ""beef"" is that it requires that you handle certificates of deposits (CD's) as investments. It does not allow input of data or analysis of CD's as an individual financial instrument."
4,Excellent Debut with a Stunning Ending,"""Bond of Brotherhood"" is a solid debut by the author. Walzak is able to keep the pages turning with an story that is both believable and interesting. Just when the reader puts together all the pieces the ending leaves you stunned wonder what happened. Very refreshing to see an ending that is out of the ordinary. The only thing that keep this book from receiving five stars was too much detail in the early stages of the book and a lack of detail during the middle and ending of the novel. Still I highly recommend the book, especially if you enjoy novels based in the South."
2,Don't expect much,"If you don't expect much from this movie you won't get disappointed. Don't dedicate time to see it; anotherwords, multi-task like play guitar or eat while watching it, and then you haven't wasted your time, yet got a glimps of the epoque which this movie well represents."
3,Moneywise Kids,"I purchased this game for my 5 year old girl. She seems to like it. It is a game that she is willing to play, but it is never her first pick. It does seem to be a good way to introduce money, but if you want your child to understand the value of money I don't think this game will help. Ex: health care is $10 and a place to live is only $30 (I wish!!)"
3,Gave as a gift,"I gave this as a gift. It was requested by a 9 year old. Cant rate it too well, didn't get feed back if they liked it or not."
4,pretty good for younger kids,"I got this for my child when he was 6 1/2 and he mastered it easily. He is very into money and has been for a long time, so I thought this would be a good game for him. We played it a few times, but I don't think he learned much, because he already knew how to count money. It would be good for younger kids who haven't gotten the whole money concept down."
2,My 8 year old did not like it.,"I read many good reviews about this game and bought it for my children, 6, 8. My 8 year old played once and found boring. I insisted to play another time, both of us did not like it. I found no point to let my 6 year old try it. I am sure she won't like it. I regret to have bought it."
1,Daylight robbery!,"extremely bad booknot original and does not match their descriptionFake, in the sense that it is photocopied one and not genuine"
4,a blessed CD,Ms Jill Phillips did a great job on this cd. A lot of good songs and some great vocals. It may not be for everyone but it was for me.
4,A Gem,"Jill Phillips turns in a lovely collection of singer-songwriterly folk/country along the lines of Mary-Chapin Carpenter. Acoustic guitar, lightly augmented by jangling electric, propels great songs like ""Wisdom"" and ""Leave It Up to You."" Her cover of Pierce Pettis' ""God Believes in You"" is slicker than the original but no less pleasing. Like fellow Square Peg Alliance artists Andrew Peterson and Derek Webb, Phillips produces modern acoustic pop that compares favorably with its mainstream counterparts."
3,For the Chemist learking inside...,This is about the history and Chemistry needed to create these glazes. This book does not provide recipes as I had hoped. However it does provide all the science and background you would need to formulate your own glazes. Definitely for the more advanced ceramic artist who wants to create glazes from scratch. Maybe one day this book will be use full to me but right now it is over my head.
2,celedon blues,"The large font used together with the layout is rather off-putting. The text is hard to read, tends to waffle before getting into any information. Being a book about a glaze and having black and white photos really doesn't give you much of an idea of colour variations. B/W works fine if we are discussing form but this is a book on glaze."
3,Sad...,"I have to agree with the previous low rating. This is a fascinating documentary to watch, but , curiously, at the same time, difficult. This woman is so grossly obsessed with her narrow universe that she has squeezed whatever joy she should have from her success out of her life. Sad."
5,Breathtaking!!!,"After catching part of this documentary on HBO, I had to go out and bought it.Not only is Nadja one (if not the most) talented violinist I have ever heard but the documentary drove me so close to her that you I felt enchanted by her music. She is an amazing musician and even more extraordinary woman.The documentary allows you to experience all the pain, stress and glory of being a classical musician. Nadja, you are Breathtaking!"
3,Not the best of Bill.,"Compared with other jazz pianists this CD has to be rated five stars. However, compared with other Bill Evans albums this is just mediocre album."
5,A Great Help!,"I just bought this dvd yesterday and what can I say, It is such a big help. Todd really shows you how to initiate your spins lay down the grabs, as well as have fun on the hill. It's great to see him and J2 out there showin you how to lay down the big moves like a pro. This dvd really helped me and I can't wait to try the moves on the hill! Everyone who wants to be a good snowboarder should buy this dvd!"
4,Dope,"I was bustin threesix's and fivefours within weeks of watching this vid, It teaches you small body tweaks and positioning that you really don't think of. If you want to advance your riding to where I'm at, cop this"
2,Beverly Hillibilles,I was disappointed. The theme song is not the original theme song from the series. The picture quality isn't great either.
1,Disappointing reading,"I was so taken by an online description of this book that I impulsively ordered The Unobstructed Universe and Across the Unknown, part of a sequence, with it. I got so bored with The Betty Book--and it is in my favorite genre of reading--that I could not finish the second half. Writing in the pre-1940s was a lot more cumbersome, I guess, and the revelations of the book were less than clear and less than astounding. I almost always finish books I have paid for, but it looks like these three will be exceptions. For me the most interesting part of the book was its cover illustration.I wanted to love this set of three books. It will be surprising if I even open the other two. That doesn't necessarily mean The Betty Book is poorly written and edited--the mechanics of the writing are fine--and someone with more patience for the writing of an earlier time may enjoy this book.Oh well, sometimes you take a chance and it does not work out as expected!"
5,BACK IN FRYE'S,BEEN A LONG TIME THAT I HAVE HAD A PAIR OF FRYE'S.MY BOOT IS VERY NICE FITTING. NOT MUCH BREAKING IN TIME.VERY NICE!!!!
4,Immigrants affect small Australian town,"When an English ""Pom"" arrives in Silkwood Australia in 1939 he is judged harshly by the local men who make their living cutting sugar cane, a hard but well paying job. He sticks it and finally begins to fit in when one group including him volunteer for World War 2. There is tension between a growing contingent of Italian families buying sugar cane farms and the locals who are a somewhat insular group. Over time, relationships grow and at the center of the store is Else, the local pub owner who was abandoned by her husband years before. She is a friend to everyone and has two attractive adult daughters. It runs 600 minutes so you get your money's worth. I didn't feel the budget detracted in any way from the story. It was not ""A Town Called Alice"" but it was a very pleasant 3 evenings for me."
3,Udder Cream review,The item was not properly packaged. It was leaking when I received it. I contacted the company immediately and never got a response from them. I would never buy from them again. They should have responded to my problem.
2,Disappointed,"I have the 4 oz tube of udderly smooth and like it. For some reason, the lotion in the 10 oz is thinner and the lotion in the 10 oz container I got smells awful. The only thing I can compare it to is diaper cream. I won't use it, the smell is so gross and it was not any better at helping my severely dry winter skin (I live in the northeast US)."
3,The real thing?,"The container (a pump) had grime on the lid. When I smell the content, I'm not certain that it is actually the Udderly Smooth Udder Cream. It doesn't smell like the real thing."
5,Elocation,"The guys did a great job on their second time around. This album is better than the first. Not many bands can put out good second albums, but these guys did. Every song is worth listening to. This time around, they seem to really sound like a rock n roll band, they really dig into it and play it raw, with great guitar solos and catchy melody. There is not one song that I dislike. Their debut record was alright, but I'm glad that I purchased and own Elocation."
4,Elocation Review,I bought this Default CD first then went back to Amazon and purchased the rest of their collection. Default is a dynamic group with lyrics that you can understand and relate to. Nickelback's lead singer Chad Kroeger played a large part in the succession of this band. If ever you have an opportunity to see them in concert I recommend it highly!
5,This CD rocks,"Elocation, Default's sophomore CD, will not let you down. It is even better than their first, The Fallout, which received great success. They have been able to achieve a perfect balance of hard edgy rock and harmonious melodies that can appeal to almost anyone. The Jeff Buckley cover ""Cruel"" is one of the best tracks. Break Down Doors and All She Wrote are awesome Default originals. Over all, I recommend you get this cd because it is awesome."
5,this cd will blow your mind!,"if you aren't a Default fan, after hearing 'Elocation' you will be. this follow-up to 'The Fallout' is absolutely perfect. this album will not dissapoint!"
3,A Default Hard Rock Album,"This CD is what ""The Long Road"" (Nickelback) would have been if it were written at 2:00 in the morning. It's good, solid hard rock, but lacks any sort of an edge or grab. It's tame and plain. There is very little new ground explored in this CD. ""The Fallout"" was much the same way, but that was a debut album whereas this is a follow-up and should be showing some progression at least. Fans of this CD would find much of the same style of music in the latest Fuel release ""Natural Selection."""
5,The new Default cd a success,"Just when we were getting ready for the start of December, Default comes out with a new cd to make everything go crazy. The new cd called ""Elocation"" delivers exactly what its name stands for. When you listen to it you depart from the usual state, an ecstasy. Hearing the loud bass of Dave Benedict sounds to the rocking voice of Dallas Smith, every second makes your heart beat faster. Danny Craig delivers serious beats to the wild styles of Jeremy Hora. A must have cd for those into any type of music. Default makes sure everyone can enjoy their cd and they proved it."
2,Been done before!,"Default's second cd was a big disappointment. I assumed most bands get better with time, unfortuately Default keeps pumping out the same old. Why do these one hit wonder bands expect people to buy their cd instead of downloading the one or two good songs they have. This band and many others better try harder to make an album where every song is a potential single."
3,when they are heavy they are on their game,"the title says it all.""who followed who"" and ""break down doors"" are excellent tracks with ""throw it all away"" being one of my personal favorite songs of the moment.if they would just stay in the heavier side of things, instead of purposely trying to make ballads/love songs/singles, then the creative juices would flow and much better music would come out.much better stuff than ""the fallout"" though.for fans of fuel,revis,and will hoge."
5,WHOA,wow!!!!!!!!!!!!! a really really awesome cd i've been listening to it over and over again its sooo great! you should totally buy this cd! if you know good music you know this is a great cd!
5,Elocation,Excellent CD! I bought it a week ago and haven't listened to anything else. I'm ready for the concert this weekend.
4,A great follow up album,Elocation is a great follow up album to The Fallout. Default is taking their talents to an even higher level. Anyone who liked the first one MUST HAVE this one as well. There is a great variety of songs the entire CD can be listened to over and over again! Pick it up today....you won't be disappointed.
4,The sum of all the hard work showss,"Default has filled a great hole. After the Fallout came out they just sorta disappeared, but now they have come back and Kicked some serious ass with their new album. Compared to Nickleback's new one, it don't stand a chance, but if you like Nickelback, and are lookin for an all around good rock cd then you will go head over heels for Elocation"
3,NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPECTING,"This cd has most of Fats' hits, but be aware that these are all live recordings that have obviously been gathered from many sources. The sound quality is good, overall, but varys; some tracks aren't as ""bright"" as others (muffled), while one was extremely hissy. The cd cover says ""Digitally Remastered,"" but it can only sound as good as the source material. The performances are excellent, very close to the original studio versions in many cases, but if you're looking for those originals you should look for another collection. I rate this 4 stars for performance, 2.5 stars for sound, and ZERO stars for not making it clear on the packaging that these are live recordings, NOT the original hits."
3,good source material,"This is a standard WOTC module release,not fantastic and not dull either.I recommend it mostly as a great source material for Archeron.It does have some enjoyable encounters in it and it is an enjoyable module side adventure for characters who have been gaming together in a continuing storyline for a while.I would recommend trying to find this for a price under 10 dollars if possible,to spend anymore than that would be better spent on one of the more recent hardbound WOTC adventures(except for undermountain;see my other reviews)"
1,A mistake,"These cookies were all dried out. I made a mistakeordering these, maybe if they were fresher they wouldbe better."
4,You should definitely own this,"I bought this album 'cause a friend recommended it, someone had lent it to him and man, was I surprised! Whip Culture is some of the best stuff I have heard in a while. Pleasure Generation has lots of new ideas and also brings back some forgotten influences, like Gary Numan and Ultravox. The beginning is total electroclash with a touch of pop. And the lyrics of Turn Me On (two chicks heating themselves up) are pretty intense. Robot Love totally reminded me of 50s sci fi. Its got lots of house, techo rock and Sound of Ice which was super Bowie-esque. If you like Peaches, LCD Soundsystem, Deep Dish or Primal Scream, you should definitely own this."
4,George has the TONE!!,"Of all the cover albums coming out these days by famous guitar players this one (along with the Schenker-Pattison summitt) is one of the best! The guitar tones on this disc are the best I've heard in a long time! The disc starts out with a version of Space station #5 and I'm telling you-You won't find a better hard rock tone! What's great is that Lynch has truly captured the feel and sound of the original versions. Thanks George for covering Captain Beyond! We must be close to the same age! Also, Kelly Keeling does an incredible job of coping the vocals-from Mark Farner to James Dewar! You want James Dewar-you got James Dewar. You want Sammy Hagar-you got Sammy Hagar!The production is great! What TONE!!!"
2,Not as advertised,"This tube would be fine for the price, except I needed to transport a 4'x6' poster. I ordered this tube because it claimed to extend to 49"", but when I received and measured it, the max length (on the outside!) was only 45"". The locking mechanism is ok, but not very secure. Overall, you get what you pay for.... it's a good cheap tube but not as long as advertised."
4,Document tube,Basic document tube that I plan to use for transporting posters for presentations. It's a bit difficult to extend and hold into place. Haven't quite figured out how to do that yet.
2,"A jumpy, misguided attempt at a medical novel.","As a medical student, I've spent an awful lot of time in similar situations as the characters of this book, and I must say that the author describes them poorly. The story is less believable than it could be. It lacks the necessary explanation and description for the way the characters interact. Another major problem is that the story jumps around violently and the characters flip sides too quickly. The problems found in the begining resolve way too easily in the end. It's almost as if the author and editor were rushed to get this novel done. This idea is supported by the glaring spelling errors I found while reading. Not that I'm perfect and never misspell words, but it helps to show that the effort put into this novel was less than it should be. I am disappointed."
2,Excellent writing but disappointing realism,"I was looking for a book on the lines of ""House of God"" with the comedic irreverence that had me laughing most of the way through the book. I didn't find it in this one. The characters were almost too real. If I weren't a nurse in amajor teaching hospital (not Bellevue!!) I would be nervous about entering one. I think what the author is trying to imply is the uncertainty facing a new intern at the beginning of July. However it is written too much like a personal journal. It was sad and ludicrous at the same time."
1,Waste of money and time!,"I'm really surprised this movie didn't have a better storyline. There are great actors in this movie, but the movie is horrible and so is the acting. Don't waste your time and money on this. If you're into gambling movies then I highly recommendRounders [Blu-ray],Lucky You, andCasino."
3,This is not a regular baseball bat,"Looks good, but not what I wanted. The bat is also semi-soft, made of some type of plastic or hard foam. Nice, but it won't work me."
2,failed Attempt at literature,"I read the one review of this book where it was rated as a 1 but it doen't appear that the writer went on to read the book as he thought it was a release of THE SECOND SALADIN under a new name.It is not. It is a new release of the Spanish Gambit.The Second Saladin is being Re-released in 1998 and is a great book. I read the book-Tapestry of Spies cover to cover over a period of a week.Usally I read A Hunter book in 2 days at most ,burning out my eyes,but this book is Hunter's attempt to write your typical high school english class novel.It is slow,with characters who come and go,plots that end without any resolution,and just seems nowhere near as focused as the usual Hunter book.I guess that it does give you a feel for Spain in the civil war,but it is a mood book and not the type of book that people expect when they buy Stephen Hunter.The book resembles a classic but as Mark Twain said -A Classic is a book that everybody praises but nobody reads."
5,Love historicals,"I love historical novels. The Spanish Civil War was pretty much ignored in public school(70's-80's for me) so learning some historical facts, checkable easily nowadays, is fun. The characters are complicated as most people are. A bit more violent than I like, but some of the situations described were necessarily violent. I guess combining greed and wars do that. Finding out the truth of the foundation of the missing gold puts 'Oh my God' spin to the whole story."
1,why do i feel betrayed by my favorite author,"stephen hunter is by far one of my favorite authors for heart-stopping, page-turning suspense and i give every one of his books a 10 except for this one. i was so excited when i saw this new book by my favorite author and paid a pretty penny for it. upon reading the first page i realized i had already read this book. The Second Saladin was already sitting on my bookshelf!!! only on the inside title page does it say that this was previously called The Second Saladin. how betrayed i felt. maybe you cant find the original anymore but at least give the new one the same title as before so as to not mislead and in my opinion betray people like me. if the book is by one of my favorite authors and i havent read it--- boom i buy it without reading the back and all the other junk. so i give my first 1 to a book on account of the deceit i felt involved with this book"
3,The chessgame,"In fact, I'm asking for help. Can anyone tell me the notation of the chessgame Levitsky played at that tournament he won? It seems that the book doesn't have the whole game, at least it doesn't play out for me - can anyone help with that opening with the lonely pawn? Please email me... Thanks."
4,Tapestry Of Spies(Stephen Hunter),"Contray to most of the reviews I've read about this book,(most of them bad)I have found this to be typical of Stephen Hunter,well written,absorbing,a first class novel.I can see where this wouldn't bode well for some younger readers,as perhaps they wouldn't grasp the time frame that this was written in.An excellent novel."
5,Great book,"The books brilliant, I don't care what anyone else says. It's pessimistic sure, but it's the spanish civil war for crissakes. For a piece of fiction, it's as true as any other book about the spanish civil war.The George Orwell/Cambridge Five spy ring connection is pulled off beautifully. After you've read the book, look up ""Julian Bell"" on Wikipedia."
2,Don't rush to read this one.,"Hunter's other books, like _The Master Sniper_ and _Dirty White Boys_, are incredible. But if you're a fan, don't run out (or click) and buy this one until you've worked through everything else he's done. It's not worth it."
2,"If it ain't Swagger, it ain't fun!","Like ""the master sniper"" and ""the second Saladin"" this book is no page-turner and lacks growing suspense and a complex plot. I was really disappointed.It seems as if Stephen Hunter's books are not on the same high level if the main character is not Bob Lee Swagger.As loong as Bob Lee Swagger is in it you can buy any of the books. But leave this one on the shelf."
1,Hunter can and has done better.,"I have read several books by Stephen Hunter and I fear this is the worst. It did not grab me by the throat and cause me to not want to put it down as some of his others have. I stayed confused a big part of the time and really did not want to finish it but his other books had been so good I kept thinking it would better. I feel now that I wasted my time. Robert Flory, I suppose is the hero but it could be Julian Raines. So many people and so many things going on. The ending was really no surprise. Everybody has bad days or weeks, I guess or hope, this has been a rare bad write for Stephen Hunter. If this is a first read for Hunter it may be your last."
2,Give the man a break!!,"I think alot of people don't realise that this was Hunter's first attempt at a fiction novel. Granted it is not half as good as his next few books such as The Day Before Midnight but every writer has to start somewhere and it would be wrong for people to judge him on his first effort.The book is fine if you haven't read other Hunter books but if you are already a fan about to read this book, ""Cut the man some slack!"""
4,I found the Tapestry a thoroughly enjoyable experience.,The chapters seemed melt away with the hours. The backgrounds leave one craving for the balmy shores of Spain and the characters are marked with a deep richness and color that leave one longing for just a few more pages. This is truly historical fiction at her most inventive.
4,Paul Doherty is fascinating!,"Paul Doherty was recommended to me by a friend who loves everything about Ancient Egypt. YEAR OF THE COBRA was the last of a riveting trilogy: AN EVIL SPIRIT OUT OF THE WEST, THE SEASON OF THE HYAENA. The trilogy concerns a controversial Eighteenth Dynasty Pharaoh written from the point of view of the Chief of Police: Mahu. Mahu really existed. Archeologists have found Mahu's tomb. I couldn't put the books down and will read them again and again."
4,braiders opinion,"This is a great book, It contains anything a guy wants to know about braids and knot tying. This book is a great value compared to other braiding books. The material is a bit dated' but it is nothing you can't overcome. I always suggest this book when someone wants to learn to braid."
2,Leather braiding.,"I was disappointed in the book itself. The years since it's first publishing should have used to update the contents. I have the Ashley Book of knots and if I'd know it was so much the same I would not have purchased it. Now, the information is quite good but the presentation should have been updated."
4,IN NEED OF UP DATING,very interesting but the step by step pictures could be a lot clearer and how to finish the braiding off.Needs to be updated.
4,leather braiding,Great book lot's of detail on making leather gear. This book is a must have for the biginning leather worker.
5,Knot Lovers Will Knot Be Disappointed,"I rate this book a close second to The Ashley Book Of Knots,as a must-have for serious knot enthusiasts. Less pleasing artistic- ly, this book nevertheless delivers instructions for construct-ing truly beautiful and functional things. From rings, to brace- lets,to hatbands to belts--they're here. Need a quirt, a whip, a lariat,a horses headstall--they're here. How about a pair of ""galooses?""--they're here. For me, the woven buttons are the most fascinating of all. Intri- cate and beautifully symmetrical, these knots are easy to make by following the ingenious method that Mr. Grant explains. (I copy the pattern, match and tape the ends to produce a cylinder, then I slide the cylinder over a rolled piece of cardboard or lino- leum and pin the bites with carpet tacks.) If you like this book, and I know you will, you might want to get Mr. Grant's two other books on the subject: Leather Braiding and How To Make Cowboy Horse Gear. Enjoy. Happy birthday."
4,"Learned a lot, but a little boring","This book was very informative, but hard to get through. I found it to be a bit on the boring side, but I did learn a lot. If you have the perseverance to get through it, it's a good book."
3,Nice case......,"Bought this case as I saw good reviews about it. The case feels very nice and it fits very well and the grip on the two sides makes the note much easier to hold compared to it w/o since it is so slippery. However, there are issues w/ the case. I cannot charge my phone when I use the case because of the way the charger port is cut. Also, I would have press the power button extremely hard in order to hit it. But for what I paid, I guess its not too bad. I would recommend the case maybe I just got a lemon..."
4,My Note Loves This!!,I love this cover. It protects the Note great and comes over the front a little so it protects the front when you lay it down at night to silence it. It's also still slim enough that I still get it in my holster without any issues. Since it comes over the front a little it also protects the edges and my screen protector won't peel off. Haven't had any issues with the buttons being hard to press or accidentally being pressed.I will say if you have a docking station this case may need some modding to enable the plug to fit. But other than that I love the rubbery feel and the grips on the side of the case. A perfect match...you couldn't ask for more.Shipping took a couple of days more than stated. I should've chosen to expedite it.
3,Not bad (blue),"Pros: slim, strong, excellent grip.Cons: the color is not dark as shown, its light blue,, the camera and flash spacing are not accurate on the camera and flash."
4,Good bargain case,Nice looking case. Very inexpensive and seems to fit very well. Excellent value and it feels good in hand. A little softer than I like and therefore most likely prone to losing it's shape/tightness over time.
5,Perfect fit!,"Great case, fits perfect. All holes align correctly with buttons, mic's and micro USB on my Galaxy Note. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting additional protection at a low cost."
4,Good case,"This is a sturdy and durable case, not so pretty as others I have seen out there, but it's a nice red color and gives the right protection for the Gnote. Mine has fallen several times and still good as new."
2,"OK, But false advertising",The case is nice. My only problems are the camera portion cover is too big and the color is way off from there picture. The color of the actual unit is like a light baby blue. Almost like a kids color. Not the dark blue they depict it as. Also the sides do not stay on perfectly. As well as the buttons are a bit difficult to depress in the case.
5,Really smooth Case,I bought this for my husband and he loved it! He says that case fits like a glove and doesn't add bulk to it like a lot of other cases do. the material adds some grip too. it looks really cool and good knowing that his expensive new phone is protected! great buy!
2,"OK, but holes don't line up","It looks and fits great. Good grip surfaces on the edges. I have the AT&T; version and the holes in the case do not line up well with my phone. The hole for the pen is so bad that the pen is trapped by the case.I emailed BoxWave, but I did not receive a reply yet."
1,wrong item sent... rip off! beware.,"needed a case asap for my galaxy note,, and what i get! a freaking case for a tablet....its twice the size of my phone, note: the galaxy note is the biggest phone around for now. so this is twice as big. its useless and a waste of time..save ur money and dont order it. get a different one."
1,The item pictured is not what gets sent to you! What a RIP-OFF,The item pictured is not what gets sent to you! What a RIP-OFFBuyer Beware Here is a link to what was sent to me:[...]What a waste of time.
1,Do Not Buy,I'm highly dissatisfied with my order of this product. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The item isn't as described instead of being a dark blue like shown in the picture it is actually a sky blue. The camera cutout of the case is also not aligned right with the camera.
1,It is diferent to the item that i bought.,"I bought a skin case for my new cellphone, a samsung galaxy note, but in the box i receibed a case for a samsung galaxy tab 7."
5,Great product!,I am very happy with my purchase this case adds personality to my Galaxy Note and my phone doesn't slip out of my hands thanks to the grip at the sides of the case. Very stylish. I love it. fast shipping and delivery. Highly recommended.
5,Highly recommended!,"While it isn't difficult to find low-priced cases for phones, finding decent-quality ones seems to be mission: impossible. BoxWave's DuoSuit accepted that mission and succeeded. The design is sleek and I have had several people compliment me on my case (I love being a trend-setter). Besides that, I really like the grip of the matte finish and the protection it has already offered my klutzy self. Definitely recommend it to other Galaxy Note owners!"
2,Doesn't do the job,"After reading all the comments, I purchased one of these case. The phone looks good with this case on it. But the On/Off and Volume buttons don't work as expected. In my case, the power button works when pressed hard, the Volume button doesn't work at all. Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down. I would rat it 2.5."
3,Read the description!,Shame on me for thinking that all Samsung note's were created equal! This does NOT fit the NOTE 2 for Sprint! The buttons are in different places so nothing matches up.
4,"Trendy, snuggy and robust cover for Samsung Note",The TPU case fits well and looks trendy. The only problem that i have noticed is the back cover getting very hot when I turn the Wifi Hotspot on the Samsung note on. Could probably do better with ventilation/ cooling vents or ribs. Otherwise a value for money and trendy case.
3,"Light blue, not dark blue as apears in the picture","Nice case, fits nicely and snug, is quite durable, and adds a nice grip. However, its real color is light blue (not what I expected or wanted)."
4,The Status Syndrome,Love this book - have read it twice more cover to cover. Michael is a leader in research in this area and this book gives place to deep thought and understanding of the human race.
1,Choose your own Adventure + Star Trek,"What kinda looney came up with this idea? Basically, you are a cadet and you have to survive in the Star Trek universe. I don't know. Get it if you're determined to."
5,A sexpert who actually has sex!!!!!,"Finally a relationship guide from someone young and hip speaking on the real deal with relationships today. Black gets the challenges of being a single sister and lays out a great plan for getting you toward love. The book is funny, insightful and real. Someone get the sister a TV show!!"
5,Looking at Self,"I am not a big fan of Relationship help books. They tend to pacify the readers, and are very predictable. This book written by Ms.Black offers a different spin on relationships advice, it points out how we must possess the same qualities that we are requiring in a mate. It has precise points, and a mechanism for positive and eteneral change for women's attitudes and attributes."
4,Real Advice from an expert in a relationship,"got this book as a promo item from the station where the author broadcasts from. honestly i had not planned on reading the book, but my latest man disappeared and i thought why not give it a try. black has written a relationship guide for sisters looking for real answers to modern dating issues. all of her own personal experiences spoke to me and gave me hope that it is never too late for love. this is definitely a must read for sisters looking for love or looking to recapture the magic in a long term relationship."
5,SYMBIOTE SPIDERMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS SUIT IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!ME AND MY BROTHER LOVE TO RUN AROUND THE HOUSE AND SHOOT CRAZY STRING!!!I DEFENENTLY RECOMEND THIS TO ANY SPIDERFAN,ITS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!"
3,Sweet Older Western,"This is classic Madeline Baker. Easily read, sweet moments, though no real ""fire"" between the couple's and a predictable plot. Overall it's a just a ""nice"" read."
