1,friends don't let friends buy audiovox,"I bought an Audivox dvd player and it was defective out of the box. I sent my device back to Audiovox FOUR times for repair, was charged $90 for 'repairs', and it still doesn't work properly!!! The customer service was extremely rude each time I called and never returned my messages. I would burn my money rather than buy another audiovox product!"
1,5 movies then done- doesn't work,I recieved this DVD player as a gift for Christmas from my wife. I used it 5 times- done - screen says no disk with DVD in machine. My wife got the ex-warranty through Amazon.com . NO GOOD UNTIL 1 YEAR AFTER DATE OF DELIVERY> THEY HAVE AUDIOVOX as HAVING A 1 YEAR WARRANTY -- AUDIOVOX HAS A 90 day WARRANTY on this DVD. I ASKED for Help ..... NO response. I was told to wait until DEC. 2006 and then reply.. I suppose I'll recieve the same at that time to--- NO RESPONSE -- BOTTOM LINE DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF *%**^%^&&^!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,still waiting,as of yet i haven't rec'd the product altho it was shipped 9/6 from nv. to az....... this is the 3rd amazon order & each time fedex has delayed what s/b a simple delivery..... i'll write again after i've received & used the product.........
2,Awful for indoors,"I climb at the YMCA twice a week and before buying these, used 5.10's with great success. These looked like a good entry-level shoe. However, the grip is terrible for indoor holds. It creates black marks on the wall and slips often. I almost seriously injured myself several times. I definitely wouldn't take them outside. 5.10's have much better/ more reliable grip.I thought maybe I just needed to wear them in, but after two weeks the grip was still coming off and causing my feet to slip."
2,not such a bargain,"Ive always been a big fan of robert altmans, and two of these films are certainly marvellous, the classic mash, unsurpassed, and a wedding, which is clever and funny, but the other two, quintet a perfect couple, are a little embarassing for an altman fan, as they really are pretty atrocious.But if youre a movie buff and altman can do no wrong, Im sure youll find some enjoyment even in those disasters."
5,Infant-Seat Cover Fits Like a Warm Mitten,This cold-weather cover fits our infant seat perfectly and keeps our infant guarded from harsh winter winds. And the cover's elastic-perimeter design allows the seat to safely function with its base as it was originally designed. It's a terrific product.
2,Short Lived,"This product fell apart after three days of use sound great love the way it fit in the ear but this is my second one bought (not from Amazon) and practically the same thing happened to each piece I am so done with this product, and angry I didn't even waste time to get my money back of $25.00"
2,Bluespoon Review 2 stars only,"pros: lightweight, small, almost unnoticeablecons: you'd better not drop it! Not sturdy at all. USB only recharge :-("
1,This CD could be better!!,"I have the several of the Deliriants older tapes, one of my favorite songs was Lemondrink, now when I heard the CD, I was so dissapointed, they really can do better."
1,"The band used to be so good, What happened?","I used to really like the Deliriants, I would go see them all the time. Then their drummer quit and they have this new guy, and I just don't think he holds up."
3,Wave for kids,"Great introduction to the concept of waves in all their forms for kids, the books a little on the dry side."
5,My son loves this!,"My son loves this game for PC. It has been great for him to learn to use the computer as well as animals, spanish and things about the rainforest. He was almost 3 years old when he first used it on the computer and now he is 5. It was great help in getting him familiar with the computer, typing his own name, spelling, reading, learning animals, shapes, spanish, some songs, and more. He still loves this game and it is very educational as well as entertaining."
5,Great Game for Kids!,"I bought this game for my three-year-old daughter. For the first three days this was all that she wanted to play. Within a day she could start the game herself and even figured how to feed the animals, selecting the amount of the different foods all at once instead of one-at-a-time. She really liked being able to play this game by herself. She really got a kick out of being more independent."
4,Simple and fun!,"This game seems to be easy for 4 yr olds to navigate. Graphics are fun and interesting, instructions are simple and easy to follow. I think any 4 yr old would like this game very much."
2,Wouldv'e been good but didn't play well on computer,"The audio on this game skipped and it ruined the fun of the game. My kids like the songs especially and when the song sounded chopped up, they lost interest. The Atari customer phone line is closed and their website only suggested to update the audio driver installed on your computer, which i did and it didn't help."
4,YUM!,"I picked this up on a whim at Homegoods of all places. So yummy especially b/c I have not had any sort of food like this in forever b/c soy sauce has wheat in it etc. (even though I buy the wheat free soy sauce separately, I can't get a whole packet dinner kit that is gluten free - hard to find). Anyway, this was absolutely delicious and there was so much sauce left that I saved it for another meal. The only thing I have to say is that it was very spicy even thought the box said mild. Maybe that is why it was at Homegoods?! Delicious, but very spicy. Can't wait to order some from amazon when it gets in stock!PS. My husband, who is not Gluten Free absolutely loved it. He loves spicy food especially and this he said was great!"
4,Classic Hervé,"Includes three solid gold classics of French pop: Capri, c'est fini; Fais-la rire; Une voix qui t'appelle. Worth it for these highlights of early Hervé Vilard. Otherwise, a couple of passable songs, and quite a few hideous ones (especially the last five!)"
4,Good vendor,I wanted this for a long time but it was my first with this vendor and the experience and service was great.Thank you
3,"Bird the master, Stitt the apprentice","Charlie Parker was a great musician. Stitt, although he admirably learnt Parker's be-bop style inside out just doesn't have the edge to make his playing of equal. Parker, as well as having the technique to match his brain signals was also a clever composer, using new harmony techniques and innovations in jazz. If anything, this album shows how far behind Parker Stitt was. He's still a terrific player though."
2,Not the best travel toy,"We bought this toy for a cross country trip with our 8 and 6 year-old children. They showed some interest in finding things, but since our six year-old doesn't read well, he became frustrated with it. The cards ended up all over the floor and subsequently ripped."
2,THE CONCERT,"Anthony Hamilton is a very good singer, but I was hoping that this would be Anthony Hamilton live concert DVD. I would have like it much better if the narrated parts wasn't mixed in with the actual live concert.There were too much talking and not enough perfomance."
3,Great singer,"I was expecting a concert, but the stops during the show left me unsatisfied.Anthony Hamilton is a great singer and his melodies are the best."
5,League of its own,"A master piece an epitome of soul music and gospel,unique,moving,spiritual,advocacy of human and women rights,soulful"
3,For fans of Kiri and the music presented,"A long, well-balanced program of several works by Mozart and Puccini, well-delivered, most notably by New Zealand's Opera legends Dame Kiri De Kanawa and Dame Malvina Major.I found some minor technical problems in the camera work and edits; and in the synchronization, unless (gulp...pause) there was some lyp-syncing. If that was a necessity, then less close-ups should have been used.The jacket art is most disagreeable, with a poor split-screen cropping of the stunning Diva."
3,"Nice blades, undersized handles","I ordered this set after receiving my Forschner Victorinox Fibrox chef's knife, hoping it would be the same=quality product. I love my chef's knife!I was wrong. Yes, the blades are great -- exactly as described by America's Test Kitchen.The handles are woefully undersized! I have trouble using them because they're so difficult to grip.I'm hoping Victorinox redesigns the handles on these!"
2,Poorly written - don't bother,"This book is so poorly written that at first I had to force myself to read it. It is full of sentence fragments, typos, and the writing style is very sarcastic. My husband commented that it is like reading a heated message board conversation. The only reason I read the whole thing is that there are some truly alarming ideas in it. However I would certainly not recommend this book if you want a good, two-sided discussion on vaccinations. I do highly recommend Dr Sears' ""The Vaccine Book""."
1,It's Easy To Like When You Already Agree,"I find it interesting that that 95% of the reviews are positive, not because the book is good; but it would seem because the reviewers already hold the position that vaccinations are harmful. This is not objective reviewing, this is finding evidence that supports your belief and asking others to accept it as proof. I would give the book a better review if it were an objective dissertation on the topic. However, the author is speaking only from one side and buyer and parent beware. THE ONLY WAY to support your opinion is to challenge it. I encourage you to read books that are pro vaccination, give equal time to each side as well as books on not vaccinating. THAT is what an informed parent, doctor and reviewer would do."
2,Alarmist crap,"America's vaccination system needs improved. Okay, I get that. But most of this book 'did you know's' read like alarmist crap."
2,Review for immunizations,"Hey doctor. I recently read your book because i was confused at first of how medecine really effects you. Your book provided alot of information but im not too sure if all of your theories u presented in your book are true. I dont mean it in a bad way but most of your information is backed up. Although some of them puzzle me. I find it kinda hard to understand some of them. Well please write back so i can ask you some questions. Thanx sincerely, John"
5,Educate yourselves!,"I have started vaccinating my child as normal, and found that THE ONLY times he EVER had a health issue was with the post-vaccine reactions, which my doctor's office looks at like it's the most natural thing in the world. So let me get this straight .... never has my 4 month old had a fever of 103, almost 104, then after a vaccination, but I am supposed to THINK and FEEL it is ok that it happened, and that I should go on?!!!! I am so grateful I came across this book. Read it, make up your own mind! Do not give up your power to choose! In this lies true freedom. Oh .... and did I mention there is not much money to be made off your back if you are healthy all your life?!!"
1,MOST ANNOYING SONG EVER AND THE VIDEO IS EVEN WORSE!!!!,"This is the worst song ever. I am not only saying this because I HATE REGGAETON but because this is the MOST ANNOYIN, STUPID, DUMBEST SONG EVERRRRRR! AND THE VIDEO WAS WORST BECAUSE NON OF THOSE GILRS COULD DANCE TO SAVE THEIR OWN LIVES!"
1,And the worst song ever is...,"...GASOLINA! Oh my god. Daddy Yankee must be on drugs! I can't believe such an artist would look into recording a song that makes the artist worse than he already sounds. Sorry, fanboys, but this lifeless junk is not music! If you want good music, listen to Pink Floyd. Everytime I hear this song is like a sledgehammer to the groin. Enjoy!"
2,there is no cabin view on any of the planes,I wanted to see realistic view of the cabin but instead you get open space. If you just want to fly the plane I guess it's not bad.
4,Airbus Series for FSX/FS04,I thought this product satisfies the buyers needs. I have FS2004 and having this Airbus add-on made the game a lot better. Gone are the simple panels of the default a/c and in are more complex panels. The graphics of the a/c are detailed as well. If you just want to fly an airbus for fun well here's the add-on for your flight sim.
2,Unrealistic sound!,"I love how the planes handle, and enjoy flighing them on short flights. But the sound is so unrealistic, its so loud it blew out one of my speakers. Also the sounds produced by the engines is sub-par at best,Ive sceen a real a300 takeoff and let me say this add on dosent even come close!"
5,"Great for headaches, carpal tunnel, etc","This is one of those cases of truth in labeling. They call this stuff tiger balm for a reason. I first started using Tiger Balm at the recommendation of a friend after I was diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Just a dab of the balm at the base of my thumb tamed a bit of the night-time pain. A touch of tiger balm on your temples will help with a headache. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before you touch your eyes, mouth, etc. This is strong stuff and it does burn sensitive skin."
2,How do you get $6.49 ($2.70 / oz) on a .63 product?,"I like this product very much, but the way it is advertised is very misleading.Unless you include the weight of the jar, the price per once is $10.30!"
5,Great Stuff!,"Tiger Balm Extra Strength is a true wonder,rub it on your shoulders or sore muscles and it really loosens them up!if your'e unfamiliar with how Tiger Balm Extra Strength works it produces a heating sensation to help ease the pain of over exertion of muscles and it works :)A few tips on using Tiger Balm Red(extra strength),do not mix water where you applied the Tiger balm for some people will will burn you.Tiger balm is available in a larger size jar.I highly recommend this product if you're into the heating balms but if you like a cooling sensation go with a product called Mineral Ice,stronger in aroma and more effective than Vapor rub."
2,Sent the wronge stuff,Well i wanted extra strength i was sent ultra strength.. was called by the company and was told we will send you the right stuff the following week when it comes in... I'M still waiting for it..
3,Good but expensive without color photographs.,The book was good with some good techniques for bush flying. At a price of $34.95 for a soft-cover book I would have expected superb quality paper and extensive color photos of Alaska's beauty that were not there. The book would be a good value at $12.95.
2,Not very durable,"I bought this for my nice who is a little overweight, it stretches easy and losses its shape. I also realize this item makes kids depend on it and don't let it go. My son and niece didn't learn to swim until they stop wearing it, BUT it can save your child's life if they don't know how to swim and you are a distracted parent."
2,Not as describled,This picture would have made my daughter so happy but unfortunately the product that arrived was Yellow. I would not have ordered this item if I had realized it was not going to be pink as pictured. As for what it is it will work just fine but it was not what it should have been.
1,(...),Not only does this swimsuit not work as far as flotation. The color bled and I had to drain my hot tub. Rinsing it out did not work. I think it left a stain in my bath tub. Don't get it!
3,Not quite right,"I agree. The pockets are not quite right... too deep and skinny. 4 slightly larger pockets would have been better. I clipped some of the stitching to work better with my chargers, ipod and Nintendo DS. Strangely, there are just pockets inside, no opening in the middle like a pocketbook. The middle section is filled with the inside ""wall"" of the pockets. Not a very logical design, but I assume cheap and easy to stitch up. The zippered bag does fit nicely into my carry-on shoulder bag, which is really all I wanted. No excessive odor... just basic neoprene."
4,A must for the kicking specialist,"If you like to kick and want to learn to snap off a piledriver of a kick this is the book. Mr. Lee introduces several basic stretching techniques that we all know by heart. But the kicking sequences help the basic to intermediate student develop ""the flow"" that they need to master kicking basics. A good book for the library."
5,A must-have manual on kicking art,"Mr Lee's technique is flawless and exciting, even in print format. The photos are well-done, so that the reader can easy follow the action and thus make the technique his/her own with practice. This is an exceptional look at the foot-fighting techniques of Korean tae kwon do."
3,Series is Slowing Down,"The series is slowing down, with Nystrom and Ishihara growing slightly desperate, but their gambits seeming to come further than ever from succeeding. At this point, it begins to be questionable whether they will ever succeed.The story is slower and not as much fun. At this point, the series begins to deteriorate and the rest of the books are not as worth reading as the first four.A good book, but not worth the search that it takes to find it. I recommend it if it is easy to find, but otherwise I wouldn't bother.Harkius"
2,Kind of boring,"This thriller starts off fairly well with a woman journalist discovering that her lover has been murdered.However, the author then finds it necessary to absolutely fill the story up with endless details that make the story drag and drag.Also, I just could not connect with ANY of the main characters and found the story just kind of goes along at a sluggish pace.I keep buying this author's books and I never seem to get into the storyline. I think its time I stopped buying them."
5,Good,My grandson is now eight weeks old and he has had absolutely no problems.. My daughter said it is sold everywhere and the price is competitive.
5,Great Formula!!,"I LOVE this formula!! My son was born at 34 weeks and after 3 weeks in the NICU only being allowed to use similac neosure. He had a problem with the similac and would always be throwing up. once we got him home we switched to the Enfamil Enfacare and hes been doing great!! we have not had any problems since switching to this formula, I just wish we had this in the NICU."
5,Better than the Similac preemie formula,"This formula is for premature infants for weight gain. Do not buy it for term babies unless directed to do so by your baby's doctor. It is expensive, but my little guy has grown well on it. The NICU gave us Similac, but that made him very gassy. He gets two bottles of this formula daily. His other bottles are breastmilk or regular formula. Do not use it for all feedings as it is highly concentrated and can actually cause your baby to become dehydrated."
4,"Great product, better than Similac Neosure for my son","My son was born full-term, but had heart surgery right after birth. So the doctors recommended a higher calorie formula to help with wound healing. Neosure made him more gassy than Enfacare. His stools are very regular and around the same time everyday when he has Enfacare. Also, for mixing formula I find the consistency of the powder to be less courrse and so enfacare mixes more uniformly in water."
1,Not worth the risk,"After buying this disk I was unable to download or play it. The prior reviews, I've read can only second everything they have said. I have been unable to down load this to my hard drive, but cannot play it from the disk! I run Windows 7 and all I get is nothing or a blank screen and sound only. This is one I would pass on, Try as you might,the better your operating system, the more you're going to get it. As much as IAtari: The 80 Classic Games in One (Jewel Case)'ve loved the ""old days"" hold off! You will be doing yourself a favor!"
1,NOT SO MUCH!!!,"i ordered this for my boyfriend for christmas and he wasn't real pleased with it...he said it just wasn't very appealing and he said it was quite boring...HOWEVER, i also got him the ""ATARI FLASHBACK 2"" so it makes good sense that the cd compared to the real mccoy would bore him..."
1,severely upset!,"i ordered the atari 80 classic games because it was advertised to have the game caled chips challenge on it. between the price of the game and the shipping and handling i paid almost 20 dollars and when i got it in the mail and loaded it chips challenge was not even there! as far as i am concerned i will not use amazon again! i will go to e-bay or somewhere else, this review is not even worth one star but i have to put at least one to get the review posted!"
1,dissapointed,"After a purchase and return and a repurchase I still cannot load this disc on my computter, menus come up and I select games but every thing freezes and I have to abort all operations. Love the original games but am at a loss with this one."
1,Would have been fun if the game would play,"What I was hoping would be a fun present for my husband (who loved Atari games as a teen) ended up as a Christmas dud. We tried three different computers in our home, two systems on XP and one on Vista. Same problem with each. The game would install but instead of playing would freeze completely, requiring a forced exit. It's a shame because my husband is a huge arcade game fan. We're returning it and will hopefully find something else he'd enjoy, perhaps Zuma or Luxor. Don't waste your money on the chance it won't play in your computer either."
1,"would not load, then it crashed my computer",I was over joyed to find this product...BUT when I got it first I could not get it to load...THEN lo and behold my computer crashed...to me a worthless product.
3,A stroll in Memory Lane,"It was nice to play pong and some of the other old games, it took me back to the 80's which I did enjoy so much. The only flaw was that they were a little difficult to control with the arrows keys, instead of the joystick."
5,GoHastings Rocks!! Thank You!,"I am completely and totally happy with my game! It was received 5 days after I ordered. The product was new as it should be, loaded without trouble, and now, I am showing my kids the games I used to play when I was their age! We love it!! I couldn't be more thrilled!!!"
2,barely worked...,"Out of the 80 games atari promised, I could only get asteroids deluxe to work normally on my Vista. That alone made it really fun, but it's a rip-off overall and you shouldn't buy this product.Since you're probably desparately looking for addicting games that work on a laptop: I had no problem with konami contra and castlevania, and monopoly."
4,brings back memories,brings back memories. Still intriguing. I like the lunar landing the best. I wish the breakout had bigger paddles. asteroids had OK control.
1,Doesn't work - don't buy!,I was excited to get this CD of Atari's classic games. Unfortunately after installing the program and clicking on a game title my entire computer freezes up. Can't play from the CD either. Complete waste of money. I wouldn't take a chance buying this as many other reviewers have had the same issue.
4,A shot of classic gaming.,This is the definitive collection of Atari classics. You don't need to mess with other lesser collections because this one has them all. It evens includes a bunch of old 2600 games. These games are best for short bursts of fun. You want a nice long involving game play experience? Get an Xbox 360. These games are also good for playing at work!! Ha Ha!
1,Slow on refund for item,It was the International edition and my instructor wanted us to use the edition that was published in the U.S.I returned it to the seller on 2-15-05 and have not yet received my refund.Please advise.Rickie Crane
1,"VHS, really?","I didn't even know people had VHS tapes anymore, therefore I didnt even think that being sent a VHS would be an issue. My fault, I probably missed that in the description. But seriously, I don't even have a VHS player anymore and I don't know anyone who does. I thought I was buying a DVD so you can imagine the disappointment."
3,service was great.,The product arrived damaged but the shipper was wonderful and credited the item quickly back to the account with no cost to me.
2,I MUST HAVE READ A DIFFERENT BOOK!!!!!,"I read all reviews of this book and just happened upon it at the library.The reviews were so glowing that I couldn't wait to get started. Well, several WEEKS later I finally finished it. The characters were bland an oh so boring. There was neither desire or romance in this book that made much sense to me. Even at the very end of this book, I was left with no feeling for either character or the entire premise of this book.She was a vamp at night and very boring and unattractive during the day???? Emily was afraid of her own shadow, but she turns into a vamp with a mask. Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just my opinion, but that is what I got from this so called romance. She was no seductress and he was no ones hunk of burning love."
3,EXQUISTE RENDERING,"I like it. It would really like to give it a 3.5 rating but we all know that is not possible.I thought this was a exquistely nice rendering of a potential victorian disaster in the making. After all married Ladys of the ton do not gamble in gambling hells of London. Yet, Lady Widow managed to do just that in quite a nice fashion. I did find it a little contrived that these same said ""Gentlemen"" of the ton would have allowed her to linger so long unscathed by their amourous intentions.I loved that her husband, albeit a mostly absent husband, did not at first recognize her as she gambled to ditch him and find her own way in the world.Over all I think the 2 star was harsh. It is really more in keeping with the 3 star rating.I think it was wonderful, light and a bit predictible at times but none-the-less is was worth the read."
2,A Good Read,"Troy Taylor has done a good job of telling this legend and providing interesting insights into what might have caused the Bell Witch to come about. I buy into the ""portal"" theory and think he did an excellent job of explaining it. The only real problems I had with this book is that the type is hard to read, and that some of the sections lack a smooth transition. All in all, this is still a good read."
3,BO--ring,"This is the type of book you find in the bottom of a box at the flea market. I read it, but felt like I wasted my 50 cent. I suppose if you are into this whole kid of Blair Witch stuff it would be interesting...but I was just plain bored.If you feel you have to read it, look really hard for it at your public library. It isn't even worth the shipping it would cost me to sell the thing on Amazon."
2,Mediocre Watch,The watch was of medium quality. Very hard to read the date. Watch band leather became dark and oily looking. Watch keeps good time.
1,This cup sucks,"This has got the be the SMALLEST coffee cup I have ever seen. Really, it looks nice, but what you get is a mini cup. It's like an expresso cup or something. Maybe I didn't see the size or something. Basically in my garage holding dirt since it's to small to have a drink from.... Go ahead and buy one... You'll see what I am talking about."
5,Not just for cross-stitchers!,"This book is a treasure trove! I confess, I do not cross-stitch. I do filet crochet, which uses thread to make lace. I have just finished creating a pattern for lace curtains for my kitchen, combining various motifs I found in this cross-stitch book. Since this book features silhouettes, few if any modifications are necessary to make the patterns work for filet. Frankly, it is a better filet collection than many filet books! And of course, I'm sure it's wonderful for cross-stitchers, too. The patterns include wonderful (and unusual) nature scenes, scenes of children at play, cross-cultural patterns, holiday patterns,borders,traditional designs, contemporary designs,and more! You can find patterns for the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty, or a scene right out of the Everglades. And of course you can mix and match motifs to make your own creation. I highly recommend this book."
5,Love this book!!!,"This book contains an amazing assortment of silhouette stitching projects ranging from period style head shots, florals, religious, hobby, country style, animals, sports, household, crafts, childhood, western, ethic, Christmas, to name a few. The best book of its type that I have every seen. There are a substantial amount of graphs to provide inspiration to you. One of the best cross stitch book purchases you will ever make!"
3,Cross Stitch Silhouettes,"Received the book today. There are some cute silhouettes. It was worth the money, but most of the projects are not worth doing."
5,Simple and Fun!,"This book gives a simple overview of some common x-rays and helps to clarify their meanings.... literally in plain English! If you have read Dubin's Rapid Interpretation of EKG's and liked it, then you would love this book. It is set up similarly. It's an easy read and there are tests at the end for review. I highly recommend it!"
2,"Good information, TERRIBLE layout","I would have LOVED to give this book a better review, but unfortunately it suffers from two things:1. Numerous typographical errors, which are unacceptable and distracting2. A disjointed layout that might have been designed to appeal to a short-attention spanned teen through bold page shifts and font changes, but comes off as disruptive and annoyingI heard Pam Stenzel speak on a radio show and was completely enthralled by the information she shared and the way that she spoke. Although my daughter is only four, I ordered this book immediately with the thought that I would read it and share it someday. Although there is some great information in the book, it is so poorly constructed both physically and in layout that I doubt it will survive until my daughter is old enough to understand it. The book needs a serious editorial, layout, and publishing upgrade. In the current state it is a challenge even to the patient reader."
2,DVD quality sucks,"I bought this for my dad for Fathers Day, and he was really excited to start watching them. He said the quality was so bad, he couldn't even finish the movie he was watching. He said it was like a bad copy from VHS to DVD. I will be returning this."
2,John Wayne Collection,Collection was not what I expected. Had not heard of any of the selections included in the collections. My son loves John Wayne and was not interested in this at all.
5,In Heaven,This was a gift for my mother-in-law who is a BIG John Wayne fan and she is in heaven. She is watching movies as I am typing.
2,Disappointed in accessory kit,Very disappointed in accessory kit - no instructions regarding how to set up tripod. Tried to contact someone to ask questions - that is not going to happen. There is no such thing as customer service anymore. The nikon 55-200mm lens was not user friendly. This was our first really nice camera puchase and was hoping for a great accessory kit that had what was needed.
1,for collectors only,"i had the single release (!) from this lp, if you can believe there was one. it was a REMIXED version of 'carry on', that has a completely new drum track added to it..basically adding a more straight ahead snare beat. what made it unusual was that it is ONLY 'carry on', and they edited off the entire 'questions' section of the track. it was pretty cool, really..but nothing to replace the original version. other than that, its a strange, uneven cash in, and quite an embarrassment to any real CSN fan. solo tracks, a couple csn tunes...just a joke. but the single, well its worth hearing. i wish i'd kept the 45."
2,Not for bad backs,I read that a hard seat was good for the back. I found this seat to be too hard and it irritated my back. Returned the seat.I am 63 yr old and already had back problems so maybe it would be better for someone else.
4,auto focus binoculars,"Product is good, small and easy to tuck in most purses. A huge bonus is the fact there is never a need to focus; therefore, when a subject presents itself, you can see it immediately without wasting time."
5,Great product,"We are very happy with these binoculars, they are a great size, with excellent viewing capabilities for our needs of watching high school football games!"
4,Excellent Binoculars for Beginners,"The Bushnell Perma Focus 8x25 Binoculars are the perfect set for children. The Perma Focus feature allows children to quickly view either a game or wildlife without constantly fiddling with the focusing part of the binoculars. They are a great size for packing away as well. The only drawback is the level of zoom. For a child's first set of binoculars or someone watching a sporting event, they are an excellent choice. Highly recommended."
3,Fixed focus binoculaars,"Good binoculars for handing back and forth between people who have different optical correction. There is no mechanism that focuses - the focus is permanently set at ""infinity."" As a result, anything less than about 50 feet is not in focus. Sharpness and clarity are good. Well worth the price for the tourist, but probably wouldn't satisfy avid birdwatchers."
1,Perma Focus? More like Perma Blurry!,"I got these to use when we go kayaking. People should be aware that these have no diopter setting and no center wheel for focusing. Supposedly easy to use because they are permanently focused at long distances. However, they are out of focus no matter what distance you use them. The image is seriously blurry at distances of 50+ feet. I checked online to see if there are hints at using them correctly, but could find nothing. Maybe I just got a bad pair. I will be returning them."
4,Very nice,"Very nice product, the size is perfect and also it is so easy to handle. I really like this product."
1,Terrible packaging!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered the Bushnell Perma Focus 8x25 Binoculars. When I received the item I was shocked. The Postal Service had to tape the box, because it was open, and it was crushed and torn. I then opened it, and found that Amazon didn't even take the time to put the item in bubble wrap or insert pop corn. The binoculars were sent back, because although they didn't appear to be damaged, I wasn't taking a chance. I bottom line is, I will NEVER deal with Amazon again. I emailed Customer Support, and never received a reply."
4,superb summer reading- a good spy novel to read on the beach!,"The story of how Thomas Lieven, a mild-mannered banker, is coerced into becoming a secret agent for multiple countries, a professional criminal and a resistance fighter during World War II will both thrill and amuse you. Based upon a collage of figures from the French underground who enjoyed cooking and the arts almost as much as snapping the neck of an unsuspecting German sentry, you will find this to be a light and enjoyable read on the beach this summer. Note- some of the recipes spread liberally are quite good too. Whether you enjoy the glamour and intrigue or the tips on how to be a good chef or criminal, this book will leave you hungry for more."
4,"Cute, Bright, and Fun!","I loved Strawberry Shortcake as a little girl and even though this DVD features the new Strawberry Shortcake (more modern, hip, colorful, older) it is still cute. My 2 year old son actually loves this DVD and when its just him at home he always picks this DVD, I think it is all the bright colors and fun that Strawberry and her friends have. ""Puttin' On the Glitz"" features a few episodes of Strawberry and her friends in their little town. I like the episode where the girls learn that its okay to do your own work - they receive machines that basically take over their jobs and while it is great to have free time they realize that a personal touch is worth it and they want to be useful. This DVD is appropriate for young kids and not just girls, although my husband would disagree! It is cute and fun and of course teaches some great lessons!Mom and More Disclosure: I was sent this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion."
1,"Three old episodes put on dvd and called ""New""!","The newer Strawberry Shortcake episodes are great--my little girl loves them. So when we have been hearing advertisements for a couple months about a ""new"" dvd, she has been SO excited. She was so bummed to see 3old episodes as this supposedly new dvd. What a disappointment!!"
1,This is just episodes from the Berry Bitty show on the hub.,Very dissapointed. I got this for my daughter for easter and she is a big strawberry shortcake fan. Realized once we started watching it that she had already seen it. It did not state that is was just episodes from the tv show.
1,the same DVD - Live In Lisbon,"This is a great performance, but better buy ""Live In Lisbon"" (is the same concert)."
4,Action,"The characters are tough, the bad guys are evil, and you will have fun. Got to get the rest of his books."
3,A Good Action-Packed Police Thriller!,"Overall, I'd rate Clarkson's New Lots 3 1/2 stars. It's filled with action, excitement and more action and excitement; and on these dimensions I'd give the book 4 1/2 stars. However, the plot, which is somewhat simplistic, and the characters, which are only fairly well-developed, deserve only 2 1/2 stars. New Lots is a book that I think you'll enjoy a lot when you're in the mood for total escapism and not much more."
4,"Very realistic, well-paced police novel.","""New Lots"" is a police novel about two groups vying for control of a Brooklyn housing project. It's a very realistic story in which locations and action sequences are described so clearly that they're easy to visualize with your mind's eye. The book is very well-paced, and the author is adept at building and easing tension."
1,Did not fit,"I ordered these for a 2009 Acura TL. The fit was very poor: The top edge of the visor DID NOT line completely with the window frame. They were definately the correct part # for the vehicle, but they were not correctly sized."
1,WRONG ITEM,TWICE ORDERED AND BOTH TIMES RECIVED THE WRONG YEAR CAR THE LAST TIME VENT COMPANY SENT ME BACK MY MONEY STATING THAT THEY ARE NOT SURE IT WONT HAPPEN AGAIN'EACH TIME I HAD TO SEND IT BACK UPS
5,"COMFY, SWEET, AND KEEPING THE LITTLE ONE SAFE!","The title says it all, when using this Super Soft Strap Cover with your little ones carseat you are making them more comfortable by using these covers by the little ones neck as well as keeping the neck more safe and more secure. Great for the littest ones to the Biggest ones. Our just loves her Kiddopotamus Cushy Straps!"
5,You'll never go wrong with Kiddopotamus,I have several Kiddopotamus products and i love every one of them. they are practical and give comfort to babies. this one specifically keeps your baby from getting that red line from the stroller/carrier straps that they'd get on their cheeks or neck especially if they move around a lot.
4,"She's Happy, I'm Happy","This have been great for protecting my daughter's neck and supporting her head - no more red marks or looking like she broke her neck during naps! They are not heavily padded on the back side (the part that Velcros around the strap) so everything is still snug, and I've had no problem keeping the chest clip at armpit height where it's supposed to be. They are very soft and have washed well so far. This is another item I've been able to pick up locally for less than the Amazon price and use immediately.EDIT 10/15/12: My daughter used these until she graduated to a highback booster and loved her bears. I have been using the same set (purchased 2 1/2 years ago) for my son for the last five months, and they have held up very well to lots of spit-up and many washes from both kids. I've found they support infant heads better if used upside down, with the bear heads up by their ears instead of their chin."
4,great covers,"Great product, works great. Now when my daughter falls asleep in her car seat she has somewhere to rest her head and the straps aren't digging into her neck. At first she was distracted by the bunnies and would try to eat them, so I turned them upside down so the bunnies are at her shoulders instead of her chest."
4,They're super cute,"I think I got these through amazon, so they were cheaper. Kind of bulky for a smaller baby (mines 2 months 2 weeks). I'm sure they'll fit better when she's older, but I don't recommend them for younger infants.Very cute, and very well made. Soft fabric, and does support their sleeping heads."
5,We love these!,"We've used these in my 4-month-old daughter's car seat since she was born, and she loves them! They are so easy to put on and take off, and you can just throw them in the washing machine when they get dirty. They are very soft, and they must be tasty, too, because my daughter loves to lick them and ""chew"" them."
2,Too thick,Th strap covers are absolutely adorable and very soft. The only problem is that they are SO thick! Much too thick for a newborn.
1,Is your child a crash test dummy?,"NOT SAFE - DO NOT USE ANYTHING LIKE THIS!Items like this have not been crash tested... are you willing to use your child as the test dummy? These covers interfere with the snugness of the straps, and the height of the chest clip. Harness straps should be worn SNUGLY against the child, and the chest clip should be at arm pit level; Meaning your child could possibly be ejected from their carseat in at accident. Why would you put your child at risk like that? Learn more about how to keep your kids safe in the car by reading your carseat manual, talking to a Child Passenger Safety Technician, or by doing a little more research. Get the facts. Don't trust random reviewers who don't know any better."
1,big no-no,"Aftermarket products like this can interfere with the harness straps, which may allow a child to be ejected from the seat in an accident. Use of aftermarket products also void the warranty on the car seat. Only strap covers if they came WITH your car seat, and only use the ones that came with the seat."
5,Brilliant! Love Love Love! Cheap solution!,"What a great bargain and SUPER cute! Easy to put on, super soft, and they help keep my 8 1/2 week old's head from flopping forward when we take off from a green light. So glad I got them. Great baby shower gift or stocking stuffer around the holidays for new mom! My LO looks sooo cozy with them on!"
5,SO SOFT AND CUDDLY,"I got these for my 6 month old since she falls asleep in her carseat all the time, and her head often slumps in odd angles- or when she gets out of the seat, i see the red and raw marks left from the straps of the carseat.These are REALLY soft, plush, adjustable for most any width seatbelt strap. They are nice and thick and I wish I got them when she was a little younger since they are so thick, they kind of help keep her head up as well! I liked them so much I got a matching pair of the piggy version for my 2.5 year old daughter since she also falls asleep in her seat on long trips and these seem much less cumbersome than those carseat pillows. They are very great and perfect and soft and easy to wash!!! I bought 4 pairs for both sets of car seats!"
1,1.33:1 Full screen presentation,Broadcast in HD Widescreen but presented here in 1.33:1 Full screen. You have to buy Blue Ray version to get complete picture. Game selection is fine but if todays movies and TV series are in 16:9 format why not Celts playoffs?
5,A wonderful resource!,"This book is simply wonderful. Jam packed with lots of information that is not readily or easily obtainable! I recommed this book (without reservation) for anyone interested in the Orishas or the Orisha Movement! Although the book may appear small and useless, don't judge it by it's cover.....it is a great starting place to learn more about your personal Orisha!"
4,Miss my old Databank,"The DBC32 is the best thing I could find, since Casio doesn't make the Databank watches with 150 and 300 pages of memory. Other than the too small 30 pages, the rest of the watch is an improvement over the older models. The display and buttons are easier to use."
4,i like it!,Solid watch. A little confusing to use all the functions but there's a manual for that. I've just been a little lazy to read it.
1,"6 months old, but not covered under warranty","The watch broke where the pin that holds the band is inserted, and cracked at the case screw. The pin was covered by the rubber watch band, and there is no impact at all to the case. I was driving a car when the case cracked. Casio said cracks in the case are not covered under warranty. It was only 6 months old."
1,This model worse in a long line of great watches,"I'm owned Casio Data Bank watches for 25 years, when they ware out about every ten years I buy a new one. They have dominated this market from the first watch introduced. However, this model is a bust! Too complicated to do simple functions. Takes too long to enter data too many key strokes. The alarm works for 10 seconds and goes off. Any of the older models would please you but stay away from this model."
2,THe buttons are too hard to depress,"Great watch but it takes a very hard push to depress the calculator buttons. I need to watch the display after hitting every digit to make sure it was entered. This makes doing calculations on this watch a very slow process and since it can only do simple calculations, it's easier for me to do them in my head/on paper."
4,Good small data bank wristwatch,"This will be replacing another casio wristwatch, which is still working but somewhat scratched. I have good experience with casio wrist watches. I was able to adjust the time and store a few data which is all I wanted to do. Only 25 data capacity. The instruction booklet letters like the watch keyboard if you will, are tiny, one almost needs a magnifying glass to read them. Other features which is new to me is the auto light. When you tilt the watch in your wrist from the horizontal position the back light lits up automatically. Overall a good everyday watch. Reasonably priced.This is an update. When I use the data function I used the tip of a pencil to use the keyboard because the numbers were tiny. I found out that the tip of my finger works just as well. I replaced the plastic strap with the stainless steel snap on strap from my old casio watch. It looks much better and putting it on is a snap."
4,Another Great Casio,"A little changed from previous data banks, but still great,like the bigger numbers. Would recommend to my friends. Good watch."
5,Casio Databank Watch,"Watch was just as advertised. Good price, free shipping. This was not my first Casio Databank watch, but I did note a few differences, too minor to mention. The only unanswered question I had was, somewhere in the Amazon ad, it stated water resistant, In the owners manual that cane with it, it listed 5 ""ranks"" of water resistance. From not at all up to scuba diving. I found no where, a listing of it's water resistance, so I called Casio. They didn't seem to know either, but suggested that I didn't get it very wet. So with that, I don't take it in the water with me."
5,Casio for traveling!,This a perfect watch for traveling. This is my third Casio in 15 years!The last one was great except I scratched the face very badly over a period of about 5 years.
4,Nice watch,"Casio makes the best watches. They are rugged and last forever. The '10 year battery' has lasted much longer than that in a few cases I've had. For this watch it's got all the advertised functions and reminds me that Casio really does have the best features in cheap digital watches.Two small gripes that are not deal breakers for me:1. It doesn't seem that it's marked as being water resistant so I've been careful to not get it too wet. I wash my hands with it on and the little splashes it gets haven't killed it yet, but that's one thing to know.2. It does have a light unlike the more simple basic calculator watch Casio makes, but it's not one of the really bright even blue backlights. It's a little yellow glow from one corner of the screen. Yes it gets the job done, no it's not as sexy as Indiglo."
4,I love it,"It is a very good set for the price i was actually expecting a lot less, the one thing i wish it had was more colors, or instead of the deep brown/red, for it to have a bright red play-doh. Other than that it is awesome, and i'm an 18 year old girl lol so imagine how much fun an actual kid would have."
4,Better than I expected,My 5 year old daughter received this as a gift. I didn't really expect her to like it as much as she has. The table that attaches to oven is worthless though.
3,Fun but not sturdy!,"Great idea, and my 3 and 5 year olds love the recipe cards. Two things bother me. The first being that the box has a huge cut out in the front, so there is no where to store the stuff once you've opened the packaging. The other thing is the table. It does not stay in the legs. Also, there looks like there is a strip in the back of it that would hold more utensils, but it doesn't. Overall my girls loved playing with it, though."
3,Granddaughter enjoyed it!,"I bought this toy as a gift for my 4-year-old granddaughter, and she really enjoyed playing with it. We do not live close to her, so I frankly don't know how often she has used it when the new has worn off, but I can tell you that she really enjoyed it when it was new."
5,fun toy for playdoh lovers,I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter who loves playdoh and she loved it ...but the stand that connects to the oven always falls off so we just turn it upside down and play with it that way because there are cool shapes on the underside you can smash playdoh into. overall it is a good playdoh toy for playdoh lovers..
4,My 3 year Play-doh hating son - LIKES this!,"Since my husband would not let me get a real play kitchen... I saw this and snapped it up! To my surpise, my 3 year old that normally hates touching play-doh, was all for this!We made lots of different foods with the molds and even wanted to sleep with the fake egg (not happening!)Oh coarse the biggest down side to this is that it IS play-doh... it makes such a mess and I am always vacuuming, but it is worth him being really happy to play with something besides Thomas the Tank Engine!"
2,Don't let the pic fool you.,"Don't let the picture fool you! It looks like a stove with an attached counter/work station. The ""counter"" doesn't stay connected and the back falls off. It's silly how the picture makes it look like you could set the toaster on it. You could set it up to take a pic for an advert box but put anything on the counter and it falls apart. It made my three year old mad that he kept putting it together and it kept falling apart. Also, the ""recipe cards"" have to be cut out of the sides and bottom of the box. This is essentially a stove and a lot of different parts and some ghetto cardboard signs. Not up to the Playdoh standard."
2,misleading shipping pricing,"While the amazon site lists shipping at around $20, this product tallies up a shipping cost of $100 to San Diego, CA. I had to remove multiple items from the cart to identify the culprit, and would hate to see someone not notice this outrageous cost."
2,More trouble than it is worth,"I read the mixed reviews on all the pottery wheels and decided to get this one any way since it was one of two things my son asked for for Christmas. Having used real pottery wheels and knowing what they cost, I wasn't expecting much. My son had a great time playing with it at first, even though he couldn't use any of the tools to shape the pots. I tried and found I also had difficulty using them and finally helped him shape them by hand. He loves the pots and tells everyone he made it on a pottery wheel when in reality, we basically used the wheel as a pedestal to work off of. We only used the wheel once."
2,Cursing under my breath with this thing,"I was extremely disappointed in this product. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. The shaping tools do not work. My daughter and I read the directions and followed them to a T, over and over again and it didn't work. It was a very frustrating experience. My daughter was in tears when she finally said ""let's take the shaping tools off and I'll just use my hands, water and sponge to shape it."" Good thing she did that. Now she has fun with it just doing her own thing. So don't have high expecations for it. Be able to improvise and go with the flow if you get this. I recommend spending money on real kid's pottery classes instead of this."
3,enough power to turn a pot,You can turn and shape a pot with very wet clay. The problem is you waste half the clay getting it wet enough to work with. Thank goodness this comes with a power cord. We haven't managed an actual pot (5 year old) but they enjoyed trying.
2,Loud Junk,"Bought this for my 10 year old daughter...mind you, this is the second one I've purchased - first one didn't work at all! It is very cheaply made. When we tried it we were immediately disappointed. It is very loud and very hard to make anything. Don't bother wasting your money on this product."
1,Don't buy it.......,"I don't typically write reviews but really felt I needed to on this one. I read all the ""bad"" reviews before purchasing but figured it would be good enough for what my 8 year old expected. Well, it was a terrible product. It was messy, difficult to use, poorly made and we ultimately just ended up with a lump of clay. Even my daughter said it was a ""rip off"". I have already sent it back to Amazon. I agree that these types of products are typically ""junk"" and should be taken for what they are....toys. However, you should be able to use them at least once and come up with some sort of end result. Not with this. Don't waste your time or money."
1,JUNK,"My Daughter went to the store and used her own money to buy this clunker. First off, the instructions are vague as to how to assemble it. You have to refer to the box art.Secondly, the motor is noisy and weak so when the thing is turning and you go to use the shaper wheel the thing will stop. Our unit the foot pedal kept sticking and would not stop.This is a cheap plastic toy that maybe a very young child would like to get their hand dirty with the clay but as an actual craft item it is total garbage. It is a cheap plastic toy and my daughter was very dissapointed and she will be getting a refund.Not sure how anyone could rate this 5 stars. Any vendor selling this item should be ashamed of themselves."
2,Disappointed Grandma,"I purchased this pottery wheel for my 9 year old granddaughter who has wanted one for two years - and I did lots of online research to select one that I thought would work well. In my granddaughter's eyes, this is still a fun toy - but to me it is NOT at all what I had hoped. The wheel is weak (I know it's a toy, but it is advertized to work), and the instructions are extremely incomplete (we actually resorted to just looking at the picture on the box). The ""tools"" are not effective since the wheel is so weak. I do like the fact that it comes with an AC adapter included. However, I'd really like to see someone make the sample pottery that's pictured on the box on THIS wheel. Unless you find this on a super-cheap sale, I wouldn't recommend buying it."
3,Not as good as I thought,Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. Was not very easy to use. Difficulty for me let a lone her. I found the plastic tools uses to shape the clay while making the wheel go around. Very basic shapes could be made not like the ones in the pictures which I am sure were made with a real pottery wheel. Got what I paid for.
1,The worst toy ever,"I just bought this for Santa and we are so dissapointed, it doesn't work at all, the product information says it has Ac adaptor but it doesn't come with the cable and the plug, altough it's new, it's all acraped. I can't believe such an expensive gift is so my daughter and I have been trying to work with it for hours without any results. I'll try to turn it back."
3,cool toy,really cool toy my son had alot of fun with it. not what i would buy for a person who is really getting into pottery though. it is only a toy.
4,fun with pottery,"My daughter really is enjoying this, I'm not sure how long it will last. It doesnt seem to have much power. For the most part its a fun toy for kids who have interest in pottery."
2,Frustrating product -,"My daughter and husband just finished trying to use this pottery wheel and we are frustrated and disappointed with how shoddy the wheel is constructed. The instructions are practically worthless. They should include more about how to center the clay and some troubleshooting tips. Once he finally got the clay centered on the wheel and got the motor to run without making hideous grinding sounds, he was able to make one pot and use one shaping tool before the motor appeared to die. He left it at that and my daughter is happily decorating it with the jewels and looking forward to painting it tomorrow. She is still thrilled. Even though we didn't buy it for her, I definitely this product is not worth the money."
2,not as good as it looks,I so so wanted this to be a great toy. This one was supposed to be one of the better ones that the motor was powerful enough to allow you to mold the clay and it spins. NO WAY!! This does not work as advertised!! Now my son got this for his 8th bday and he thinks it works so for that I guess it doesn't matter. He puts his clay on gets all muddy and wet and does his projects. But truly in reality he is just molding the clay with his hands the pottery wheel is of no use. But guess if he is having fun and thinks it is something special all is good!!
2,It;s just OK.,"Read through the reviews and this specific pottery wheel looked promising. It's cute, but not worth the cost. The motor just isn't strong enough to be used properly."
4,THE GREAT CHI LITES,A full concert on the Chi lites. Doing all their hits? Who could ask for anything more. The kids today need to watch this so they can get an idea of how to entertain an audience.
2,Kind of disappointed,I grew up in the 70's when music was sooooo good. And I have bought several concert dvd's that have been put out. This one is by far the worst. I've always loved the Chi-lites but this definitely wasn't what I expected from them. I have one by The Dramatics Biggest Hits Live that is amazing and I can't stop watching it. The Dramatics still know how to groove. The Chi-lites will just be added to my collection. But not one that I will pull out to watch with anyone else.
3,To retire or not to retire?,"I must say it is not easy finding older Motown or soul live performances on DVD. And if you can find them, they are usually of poorer video and/or audio quality. After having said this, there comes a time when even the best need to hang it up. I know you gotta pay the bills. This DVD is an example of what I'm talking about. Once at the top of their game now should leave the game. Old men who can no longer sing in tune and have lost the ""punch"" in their sound. I will keep this DVD for my soul library but not one of my best choices."
1,Very disappointed,"Placed this order over three weeks ago. I don't plan on making any more purchases with that company ever. Contacted the company by e-mail twice, they have yet to respond. Still no Chi-Lites."
1,comp cam break-in oil additve 159,"This item was shipped in a box with out inclosing it into a plastic bag first .Cap cracked and this oil drained into my mail box all over my bills,magazines and mail. what a mess cleaning this up.I only hope they learn from this and ship more efficiently in the future. Hope no one else has to expirience what I did."
1,Sick and Demented,I was sick and demented for buying this album. I was totally out of hand when I made the decision. It was an uncalled for buy. Some rank this album highly. What are you talking about. It is boring. Sometimes it is alright to just cheese out and listen to mellow music. But I am lactose intolerant when it comes to this cheese. It does not do the trick for me. Like a Korean with a mullet and a Yankees hat. Totally unacceptable.
3,Good Listen,"To me, Umphrey's McGee sounds similar to an upbeat jazzier version of Ben Folds Five meets the Allman Brothers. The music blends rock, blues, jazz, country, and a splash of prog so there is variety for all to enjoy. The disc is loaded with blazing guitar solos and quality music played by proficient musicians. If the label ""jam band"" refers to turning a three-minute song into a ten-minute tune due to extended improvising, or just making up tunes on the spot, then this would be a great band to see live."
3,The delusions of an amateur sociologist,"Gurdjieff's fabulous sense of humor notwithstanding, this book, and most of his work, portrays an active imagination and a poor soul who appears to actually believe his delusional, otherworldly explanations for human behavior. ""Kunderbuffer?"" Come on! In his efforts to ""bury the dog deeper"" Mr. G accidentally dropped his brain into the hole. I love you George, but slap some sense into your students, please!Stay with ""Meetings with Remarkable Men"" a great romantic travelogue, very touching, pithy and humorous."
1,"Read it, tried the work they were both a waste of time.",I don't recommend this book or pursuing this dying philosophy. I read the book and joined the New York Foundation on 123 East 63rd Street in Manhattan and was completely dissappointed. Dont waste your time and money. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWkqDwfpN0o
3,Preaching from the empty,Mostly rubbish. But what isn't is vital beyond words. Discriminate. Watch out for scarlet herrings. Read it with care and imagination or don't read it at all.
1,Not What I expected...,"I ordered this for my husband. It is not good. This Tea has a funky smell and tastes the same. I thought it might just be us so I gave a box to a friend.(I've got alot of it) She came to me the next day and asked if I had tried it? I lied and said ""No, Why?"" She told me ""It's kinda funky tasting and it stinks"" She gave it to her Mother-In-Law who is Vietnamese but I haven't heard how that went. I'm hoping the MIL likes it so I can unload the other 5 boxes.Very Disappointed."
3,More statistics than technique,"I was hoping to get more strategy for mitigating risk of system failure than was actually addressed. Overall, still useful, but is more targeted at networks than systems with embedded computers."
5,A 'must have' for medieval recreationists,"This is a great book for beginners and veterans alike. Through text and recipe, Ms. Santich dispells many of the myths regarding medieval cookery that have somehow become 'gospel'. The recipes range from very easy to slightly challenging and cover enough ground that a sizable feast can be presented based on this book alone. I hope that it gets a reprint soon, this book would make an excellent gift as well as a great addition to an already established cookbook library."
4,Yummm,"This is a different slant on the medieval recipes you get in most these styles of books. The recipes are very tasty and have a real ethnic flavour along with the medieval tastes. The info B. Santich gives about certain things throughout the book make it a fun read even when you're out of the kitchen. I definetly recommend the ""Chicken with Verjuice"" as it's delish."
1,Not at all what I expected.,"Like another customer, I believed I was purchasing a grant book that came with a CD-Rom and was quite surprised when I received only 1 package. I thought it was a mistake but apparently not. Had I known I would have spent $10 more and bought from another website."
4,Good Book,Good read and had some really good insights and knowledge of how and what it takes to follow Christ.
3,There are some cuts on here,I used to have this album back when it came out in the 90's. I bought it on Amazon in 2006 for $1.75 (CD). Some of these tracks could be hood classics today. Great production from Warren G. I would say this is like MC Breed's Thug Life style album.
4,average album,"After hearing mc breed and dfc before I had a feeling this would be good. Its not a classic, but its still a good album all the way through. It has a few guest appearances from some well known artists. The beats are sounding nice and the rapping is cool too. Theres a few tracks that ain't too good, but most of the album is ok. Its not as good as breeds stuff, but definately worth getting. So make sure you pick this up if you don't have it. Later!"
1,Illegible,"I bought this as a gift for my goddess daughter. Unfortunately, it is completely illegible--worse than pictured. You can't make it out, even when staring at it up close, let alone on someone's neck."
5,Exactly what the radical left needs to hear....,"This book brilliantly exposes the true, almost universal nature of 20th century revolutionary regimes. The similarities between Stalinism and Italian Fascism were indeed more profound than their differences... and one conclusion that can be taken away from this book is that supporters of the so-called ""leftist"" version of this phenomenon should indeed be held to the same level of accountability as the supporters of the ""right-wing"" variant.One should also consider the ability of Stalinists to portray their fascist revolutions in progressive light during the 20th century... and what forms of radical ideology could/are being made to seem palatable to the West in 21st century...Radical Islamo-fascism primarily comes to mind."
1,Obnoxious historical revisionism,"This book is one of a handful of bibles of the 'new' right. The libertarian fringes want to paint all evil in the universe as being part of the political 'left'. They are as doctrinaire as any Soviet-era Marxist, and far less subject to academic scrutiny.While there are certainly many similarities between fascism and totalitarian communism, this piece of propaganda completely ignores the historical underpinnings of each movement."
5,Love this movie,"This is a great moie. Kind of gross and weird, but enjoyable. Definitely a reminder of how bad fast food is for you."
3,Not a bad documentary,"Movie is a pretty solid swipe at the fast food industry. I think most of us would agree that eating nothing but fast food for every meal is pretty darn stupid, yet many folks still do it. There were some scenes that are a little over dramatic and probably overplayed like many agenda driven documentaries, but overall good enough to have my kids watch it. The documentary conclusions (both outright and implied) are correct - fast food bad for you. Learn to cook fresh food at home."
5,"Supersize me, please don't","Should be compulsory viewing in all schools and colleges.When will sugar be treated like a drug and regulated, no more than 1/10th g per day?"
2,annabel,This video had a lot of difficulties laoding and it was beffuering a lot and wouldn't let me watch it the way I wanted to watch it.
4,"good tips, good information, good recipes!","this book has LOTS of ideas on how to prepare meals for your kid that are healthier than pre-packaged, store-bought crap. i couldn't believe it when i prepared the spinach and cheese souffle for my 13 month old and she devoured it. (usually she doesn't like eggs, cheese, or anything green). she also really likes the cheesy lentil sweet potatoes, which blew me away! it has been an incredibly valuable resource when it comes to nutrition information for kids. most of the recipes are pretty bland (low-sodium/low-sugar), but bland is what my kid seems to like. its a really great cookbook, the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because some of the recipes involve a lot of ingrients and take way too long to prepare."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book as a gift for someone who has a toddler. I thought it would provide good ideas for dinnertime meals. I was disappointed when I looked through the book at the recipes. Although some looked very child friendly, such as chicken nuggets and smoothies, some looked like they were more geared towards adults. Sardine bruchetta, walnut pesto,and sweet potatoes with lentils and bacon all sound delicious, but may be more appropriate for the parent's tastes. I was so disappointed about what I read that I couldn't bring myself to give it as a gift even though the book is beautifully put together with great pictures."
3,3d,Its hologram 3d with some depth put its not like IMAX were you get protruding floating image in 3d
5,They finally got it right,"This is a fully revised edition of the first pictorial history of the pulp magazines to be published and the authors finally got it right. There is a complete index of magazine titles and the artists who painted their covers, the images have been rescanned to eliminate any ""moire"" patterns that may have degraded the paintings, and the most unusual cover ever published has now been included (a painting by John Held Jr., famous for his ""sheiks and shebas"" of the Jazz Age). The cover has been redesigned and features the image of a pirate far more fearsome than Johnny Depp. This is the book that started it all and the price is now more than right. --Frank M. Robinson (I'm one of the authors)."
2,A toy for sure,I wouldn't say this product is very educational. It is not in scale and the planets all rotate together. I think a young child would like to watch the planets go around. Older children would get bored quickly. What do you want for $25.
1,Poor Quality - Does not work as advertised,"We were really excited about giving this to our son for christmas, he loves the solar system..... Unfortunately ths thing is a lemon. The rods that hold the planet were bent so the planets would not line up properly, and would collide if the paths crossed. The motorized feature rotated the planets but not in the proper relation to each other, detracting from its educational value. There really is no point in purchasing this unless you don't mind using it as a stationary display, otherwise its worthless."
4,The bulb for the sun,This is a great toy and educational tool. I give it hight marks. I have one complaint. The bulb for the sun doesn't have a long enough life. [...] Thanks in advance.Les Campbell
1,Would have been ok if it came with all the necessary parts...,"Of the assorted space models Santa brought my seven-year-old daughter, she was most excited to put together this light up model. Sadly, the kit was missing the connector to attach Venus. I contacted the Educational Insights company twice to ask for that one missing part so my daughter could complete her project (the model is useless without all planets connected). However, Educational Inights failed to respond to either of my requests. Buy this product only if you want to be disappointed."
5,good teaching tool,"It's a great teaching tool for children and adults alike,the only drawback are the instructions are not very clear and simple, and it takes time to put together,the planets are not exactly accurate in color , but all in all my grandson loves it."
3,Nice but kind of cheap,"I purchased this as a gift, when we opened the box we noticed it runs on batteries and has a hole for you to plug it inthe wall, but doesn't come with the wall cord. While running you can hear all the gears turning while its moving (guess they won't be sleeping with it on at night). It comes with a star map which is pretty cool but very dim. This product was okay"
1,A total waste of money,"This toy is very cheaply made. It uses C bateries but not indicated anywhere in the box ormanuals. The sun is made of two piece cheap plastic that don't fit together properly, so, one part keeps falling off unless you tape it with clear tape. The planets are outside the range of light so there are no useful shadows. The rotation produces a fairly laud motorized sound. Also the bulb burned in less than an hour and the fact that it came with an extra bulb, does mean that you can expect the second bulb to burn in no time as well. Ultimately, this toy is a lame waste of money, a good idea with lausy production from China that really belong to the shelves of a ""DOLAR STORE""."
2,sub par,"its sub par, the motor is effectively useless since it rotates all planets at same time (they are not geared). planets are not sized respective to each other nor are they spaced correctly. Jupiter and Saturn actually colide as you manipulate them. other than understanding the order of the planets and their respective Greek symbols it is of poor value."
2,Geosafari Motorized Solar System,"This solar system was difficult to put together. I read and reread the instructions before finally finding the symbols that tell you which planets are which and where they go. The little end pieces that the planets sit on keep falling off when my son pulls the planet off the rod. And all the planets move at the same rate. My son really only plays with the planets by themselves, so I could have saved a lot of money by just buying him the planets. He wasn't interested in the rotation when all is said and done."
4,"Nice, but parts are flimsy","Bought this for our 5 yr old son. He loves it! Easy to assemble & more educational that I thought it would be. Only con is that it is flimsy, but I guess that's to be expected. Favorite part is using the constellation globe at night."
3,IS IT TOO SOON?,Tracy Byrd undoubtedly possess great voice and everything he sings seemed to be above par. But is it too soon for him to have another GREATEST HITS? It seemed that almost all of the hits were included in the previous one already. He should have waited some time to do it after a couple of new albums.
4,Tracy Byrd,"Tracy has pulled songs from most of his CD's to make up this package. While some fans might not believe that is a good idea, this listener likes having his hits all in one place. From Watermelon Crawl to The Truth About Men this is a feel good, have fun CD. There are a couple of new songs included Johnny Cash and Revenge of a Middle Aged Woman. Johnny Cash is a definate honky tonk crowd pleaser, it has a toe tapping beat and should get you out of your seat and wanting to dance. Revenge of a Middle Aged Woman is the tale of a woman upset with her cheating husband, it is another toe tapper that Tracy is known for recording."
2,Not as useful as I had hoped,"After reading the first review I bought two of these sets, one for me, one for my Mom. They're awkward so you can't keep them on the sink next to the sponges without looking funny. The other problem is the yellow brush is stiff and not very useful, the metal brush is so hard it scratched everything I used it on. Steel wool is much more useful as it's a little softer and doesn't scratch like this metal brush stick does. You're better off using a BBQ brush on your pans.I like that these are made in the USA, other than that, they're worthless."
2,BE CAREFUL... Lots of MISTAKES in this book.,"I started reading this book and found so many mistakes that I had to come online and vent. The book is an ""easy read"" with alot of good info, however, if you have no NT experience, the mistakes in this book may confuse you. Example: Page 62, question 6; Book gives answer as 4 tape types, the preceeding chapter, only give you 3 types.Example: page 118: (1st sentence) You can also demote the PDC. Page 41: You CAN NOT demote the PDC.Example: Page 91: ""See figure 6-1"" Problem: Figure 6-1 (or any other pictures in chapter) DO NOT show what is being talked about.There are countless more.If I had not already taken the CD out of the book I would return this.ps - I went to the bookstore and the ""2nd edition"" has the same mistakes."
5,The Oxford History of Christian Worship,"A geographically and ecumenically comprehensive work that concerns itself not only with the past and the present, but also with projections for liturgical developments of the future. Readers interested in the development of Catholic Liturgy in the Hispanic American mainland will find the article by Jaime Lara particularly useful."
5,Gifts,"I cannot review this item, as it is a gift for another person. Ask me again after Christmas when he has opened it."
4,One Major Problem,"I Purchased 2 of These Sub Woofers & then I Realized that the Main Trim on these do Not get Screwed with the Speaker itself & that they are Glued on, I Feel in time these will Vibrate away from the Speaker itself. My Experience with Glues I know that even Glue Breaks down due to Tempature Changes. What I did was I went down to the Hardware Store & Purchased Stainless Steel washers, Screws & Nuts & Fastened the Entire Sub Woofer to the Box itself to make sure that the SubWoofers Trim will Stay together & Not Vibrate Loose Due to the Glue Breaking Down & come Apart. Outside of that I Feel that once I Hook these Bad Boyz up they will Not Only Sound Great but will Last a Long Long Time. This is Why I give them 4 Stars. R.G.B.Jr."
2,bottle clogger!,"I hate this formula because it is always lumpy, no matter how much I shake and shake and shake and shake....... My baby still spits up a little, but that is to be expected. The thick formula is a real pain to deal with. So unless your baby has a REAL problem of spitting up, it isn't worth the hassle. I think my baby spits up less with the regular Enfamil product than she does with a generic brand of formula that I tried. So I still prefer Enfamil brand."
4,Great for GERD,"Although this formula creates quite a bit of foam and bubbles when mixed, it has helped my 12 month old who suffers from GERD. He does not spit up at all anymore!"
2,Breaks your hair,I have a wigo that I was using before I bought this product and it worked great. However THIS product damages the hair. It does not go over the hair smoothly and in just a few uses it has cause major damage to my hair. Save yourself and get a CHI
3,Wigo,"The transaction was very smooth - but, the product is not great. However, you get what you pay for - I paid half of what I had planned to pay for a better brand of flat iron. In retrospect, I'd rather have saved up and purchased the better flat iron."
3,game,kinda fun game. It takes awhile to getting used to. Totally different than any other wrestling game out there. But it is still fun to play
4,Fun for a while,"If you like Muscle toys, etc you'll probably like this game. I like that they have some custom dialoge for certain match-ups. It's easy to pick-up but not as in depth as other wrestling games is why I advise it for fans of the toy mostly. I had fun unlocking everything & playing every character to see which characters I could get on the top 10 records which I filled.Good fun but will sit on your shelf after a short enough time. Try to get it for under $10.00 & you should be happy."
4,An ok tent,I like this tent a lot seems like it would be really nice. The only problem that I had is...I put it up for the first time and one of the hooks that you use to attach the tent to the poles broke. I am trying to contact texsport to get a new one and then of course I will have to figure out how to attach it to the tent again.
1,Too much noise but very few nuts,"This DVD is very disappointing because gives almost nothing about jumping that can be useful for a beginner rider.I ride since 1 year ago and I am jumping obstacles up to 2 feet high, so I am a beginner that bought the dvd expecting some tips from Greg Best, but instead the title "" basic jumping"" it should be named ""Subbasic Jumping,"" because the information he gives is too poor for the price."
5,"REGINE, THE QUEEN OF PARIS.","I sung at Regine's place when she owned ""Le Doyen"" on Les Champs-Elysees. Most people only know her as the ultimate disco owner in Paris and world wide. This album will show you how sensitive and avant-garde MADAME REGINE can be interpreting old French songs, reaching perfection with exquisite and refine musical arrangements. Pascal Hakim-Levy."
1,yuo go to my head... like a brain tumor lingering round...,"tHIS CD GOES TO MY HEAD LIKE A brain tumor LINGERING ROUND IN MY BRAIN, MAKES ME WANAN GET DRUNK WITH A GALLON OF CHAMPAIGNE... THIS IS A BAD CD, SKIP IT, AND BUY ELLINGTON INSTEAD"
1,"This cd is ok, but it isn't very romantic","Buy Duke Ellington Blanton Webster sessions, those feature Strayhorn himslf, this cd isn't roamntic and it doesn't take a rocket scientest to figure out how bad it is, it's just ok, but it isn't romantic."
2,This book does not give sufficient information.,"I thought this book would be very helpful considering the reviews I read. However, the book was not helpful at all. A class of twenty people purchased this book, and none of them found it very beneficial. The possible difference between my review and the others is that I was using this book to study for an exam. Other exam notes books may be more helpful such as those by sybex."
2,Most of the stories are bad,I would read other Greenberg anthologies like Sisters in Fantasy I and II or Marion Zimmer Bradley's Sword and Sorceress series. Don't waster your time.
1,Poorly made,"I bought this product as I was impressed by all the functions it performed: seat reclines, height settings, and so on.I didn't realize I would have to put it together from scratch, which I did with some difficulty, it took me the whole day. The problem we have with it is the cover pad - it is very poorly made and very flimsy. After the very first wash - using the instructions - on delicate cycle and hanging to drip-dry, the lining started tearing. After three washes the lining is practically falling off. Another concern is that I already have to put the tray on the outermost setting to give my baby room to breathe, and he is only 22 lbs (this chair is supposed to last until 45 lbs.), otherwise his tummy is getting squashed, and he is a skinny baby! I would not recommend it."
1,Very disappointed,Not durable. Only had it for 3 months. Plastic is cracking and unsafe. Would not waste the money.
1,Disappointed,"We were fairly happy with this high chair in the beginning, however now that my son is 8 months old I feel it is very unsafe. He pushes on the bottom of the tray with his feet and the tray has come off on several occassions. I have tried to secure it as best I can, but it does not fit tightly and comes off way too easily. Another complaint - the tray has to come off in order to get the child out, which is inconvenient. And one more - when moving the chair around the screws that hold the legs on have popped off quite a few times. Overall very disappointed with the product."
4,Trend High Chair--Great as secondary high chair,"This high chair is only being used when at my mother's house, so it doesn't take the daily wear and tear for a totally honest review. However, with only minor difficulties putting the chair together, and the ease and sturdiness of use, I would totally recommend this product, if only as a secondary high chair."
1,Very Disappointed,"This high chair was great when my daughter was littler. She is now 9 months old and can as well remove the tray by using her feet. She is able to get her toes up in the release latch and pushes it off. I called Baby Trend and they had no solution to my problem, Other than to possibly have my baby wear shoes while she uses their high chair and maybe then she won't be able to get her toes up their to release the latch. Oh, yeah the other solution is to use duct tape to cover the latch. Great advice huh?They did call me back and advise they are going to send another tray.... Not sure what that is going to solve."
1,Horrible Experience,"It has been a month since I tried to put this high chair together. The instruction booklet was missing directions for a very important step. Also, the parts listed and the parts in the instructions did not match.The help line for Baby Trend products is only available from 8:00 A.M to 4:30 P.M as noted in the instructions booklet, however, it does not advise you that this is only Monday through Friday and of course I was assembling the high chair on a weekend when I needed help.It has taken six phone calls to Baby Trend so far, and twice they have sent me the wrong part. The last part I received was for a baby stroller.I spoke with Jeff the mananger(no last name given, as they don't do that)who advised they know about this problem from previous complaints. This stroller should have been pulled and replaced with one with correct instructions and parts.Still waiting for the correct part."
1,non effective,"Nuwati Herbals Indian Blanket Balm, 4 OuncesI have been looking for different products for muscle and joint pain relief,but this did not work.There is an odd smell also which I wouldn't really mind if the product worked.I could not recommend this for anyone to use."
2,Tips and techniques are sketchy at best,"This book has some attractive patterns, so, if you're just looking for patterns to blindly copy, it is probably fine. Unfortunately, however, it bills itself as offering tips and techniques -- which are very sketchy at best -- and the Resources don't even include Papercuttings By Alison, which is where 99% of US papercutters purchase their supplies. You would HAVE to own at least one other papercutting book to be able to use this -- which is a darned shame, since it would have been very simple for the author to mention the basic things every papercutter knows about using paper, scissors, knives, etc. If you're going to NAME your book Techniques, you really ought to include as much information as possible. Conversely, if she'd named her book Patterns, it would have been fine. I just wouldn't want anyone to think that this is a standalone book on the subject ... It is a book of patterns, with a few tips included."
3,Not What I Expected,"This book did not provide the technique as suggested by the title. However, I did get some good ideas from the photos and patterns."
4,_,"This Austin, Texas, four-piece subtly does justice to mid-'70s, Bomp Records power-pop without resorting to bland navel-gazing of such contemporaries as the Promise Ring and the Get Up Kids. Amidst the sparkle and chime of strummed guitars and politely driving tempos, Silver Scooter betters latter-day Superchunk with unobtrusive deliveries that nevertheless keep an enjoyable energy through a sustained sigh. Try ""Morning View"" with a smooth cuppa coffee."
3,No exit and the whole it has,"Reading this book for a school summer reading list is like putting a gun to my head, or so i thought. I really enjoyed this play because of the diolgue between characters and the witty behavior that Sarte used. however i found parts of it so bloody boring that i could help but fall asleep. I did most of it very enjoyable and i hope that you will tring reading it as well."
2,.,"In reponse to a review below -- I have an IQ of about 130, andI think No Exit s**ks. I should also add that I like Jean-Paul Sartrequite a bit. Nausea was rewarding and The Age of Reason was incredible. But No Exit is a painfully overrated, silly little play. I found it interesting simply because it was by Sartre. But the interesting premise aside, No Exit is just simply not very profound, and generally poorly done. Seeing it performed might increase my appreciation somewhat, but then again, it might not. The whole play is based around a single philosophical idea -- ""Other people are hell"" (or create hell for the individual.) It is a flimsy and not particularly interesting idea, which is poorly expounded on in the play itself. I gained almost nothing at all from reading No Exit. The Flies was better, but far from great. I haven't read the other two."
5,"""The folk of Argos are my folk. I must open their eyes.""","I have read this little collection countless times over the years. I have seen Huit Clos (No Exit) performed several times (generally poorly) but it has never quite lived up to the power that I find in the written version. I realize that this is unusual for a play, and may reflect a fault in Sartre's work rather than a strength.It is important to remember, however, that Sartre's work is always more about the ideas behind it than it is about the form he is using. Sartre wrote novels, plays, essays, and criticism during his long career. Through it all, he was a philosopher-- struggling with the notion of freedom and indifference.People (particularly students) tend to stop with No Exit, neglecting its less famous cousins. This is a shame, as both The Flies and Dirty Hands are fascinating pieces. Particularly if you have an interest in the Oresteia then The Flies is a wonderful interpretation.A must read book."
3,good but not great,"These four plays were good plays- they are easier to understand if one is familiar with Sartre's philosophy. The plots in all these plays were both unique and exciting yet at times, especially in dirty hands and the flies, the plays seem to drag on and on. Had the plays been shorter, Sartre's main point would have been made clearer and more forcefully. In plays, it's hard to communicate character background yet with a novel the author can just describe it from third-person perspective. I think perhaps these plays would have been more successful and more dramatic had they been written as short novels with more description and character analysis. At times I felt that the characters were explored and described in superfical ways. All in all, these were good plays yet I cant say I loved them. This might just be me though since I have never been too fond of the format of plays- i feel like it never gets to the heart of the character since you only get dialogue with little analysis."
1,Bad Edition,"This edition contains only half of Volume I. The text is also filled with strange typos- many pages have a mysterious small ""p"" at the beginning of each paragraph and some paragraphs have random ""g""s where spaces should go. Finally, compared to other versions both in print and online, the translation is atrocious and very difficult to read."
3,so-so,"Certainly this is much better than ""The Big Store"", but it can't really compare to ""Horse Feathers"" and, of course, ""Duck Soup"". Where is Margaret Dumont?"
1,Do not buy this version,"Capital Volume 1 is a masterpiece. However, this particular version is trash, it only includes HALF of capital volume one, AND the publishing quality is atrocious, all of the equations are jumbled up and illegible."
4,STV vs. LTV?,"The review below hinges on the reviewer's (who sounds like an advocate of neo-classicalism) rejection of the LTV. The transformation problem is a thorny one, yes, but not one that cannot be worked out. Did not Stigler determine that 93% of the differences of prices could be calculated with the LTV? This is an important piece of empirical evidence, no? STV, on the other hand, treats every commodity as if it were a work of art or a diamond or such, completely ignoring the modern mode of production. Not only did Ricardo endorse the LTV, but Smith also.From there the reviewer lapses into ad hominem. Should we judge Christianity by the atrocities committed in its name?"
4,not a bush basher,"I am not a Bush fan, neither am I a Bush basher. I was with himuntil Iraq happened.This book is different from other Bush-bashing books I've read, because it focuses only on one thing:Iraq. And it only gives 5 reasons why the author feels Bush lied. The most intriguing thing about the book, is that 4 of the 5 reasons the Bush administration gave for invading Iraq, have come to be considered false or weak reasons, by everyone from weapons inspectors, politicians on both sides, and the general public, to our foreign allies covering most of the globe."
3,Bush Lies,Depresing but interesting book. Confirms what I already believed and then some. Outlook for the future of our country is uncertain and the new administration has what appears to be a herculan task.
3,Informative Read,"I found the book to be informative. Being able to read it 4 years after it was published adds a strong current of correctness to the book as some of the things that the authors write about have come true - billions of dollars spent, US lives lost, Iraq still a mess etc.This book is valuable reading and should create some important questions about the Iraq situation. It is a worthy complement to Bob Woodward's trilogy on the Bush Administration."
1,WASTE OF TIME,I watched Scheer debate at the LA Times book festival and felt compelled to read his book due to his passion for the subject matter. I borrowed the book from a client and I am sorry to say that it was a waste of my time. Spend your time doing something productive. This book isn't baffling and surely not impeccable. This book was written at a time to make some money off Bush bashers . . . nothing more.
2,This DVD should be titled a day in the life of Dr. Beckwith,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be, as it is advertised, a learning program with the insights Dr Bernard brings so well. While the DVD is interesting, if you would like to see how Dr. Bernard lives and his church he founded it is not something you'll glean any real knowledge from. I like the DVD and found it intersting, I just don't why it had to be sold with the description as it was for ""life changing"" information."
3,used DVD,"Dear Amazon, This DVD was damaged and I only got to see about half of it. Loved the songs. Thinking about returning it for a new one. Dan Bridge"
5,Sturdy and efficient,"Very well made. Works great on uneven pavement. It does require a bit of effort to push (that may be because I'm 5' 95 pounds so I'm not powerful), but it is very effective."
3,"Good broom, but not worth the price.","This is a really good broom, but considering you can get a $5 shop broom at your local hardware store I would not recommend buying. It is not 6-7 times better than a cheap broom. I would say this product is a good buy under $15."
2,Not that great............,"I agree with the first guy. This movie pack was not that great. I purchased it hoping to see some actual combat footage (or any footage for that matter) taken from the vietnam war. instead, each VHS which is supposed to specfically target one fighting aspect of the U.S. in vietnam (i.e. the marines, the bombers, the navy, helicopters, etc) just shows the same footage over and over. For instance , every video shows a diving helicopter shooting rockets and B-52s dropping bombs, which is cool the first time you see it but after 10,000 times it gets old and you realized you wasted your money."
1,Watch the History Channel instead,This was a boring and put you to sleep series of videos. More like the training films we used to have to watch in boot camp.
4,Big one,"I bought it 3 weeks ago, and I'm pretty happy with it. It's very spacious, but have no belts to keep save de lap top."
4,Scars of Pain -- a review by Megan,"Eleanor Driscoll has to go through all of her high school years with scars on her face from a fire that she and her father got caught in. Now she has to ignore people laughing at her and gossiping about her as she walks by. She has a penpal who doesn't know about her face, but that's the only friend she has. Then she meets Clarisse, who see farther than her scars.I usually have trouble reading for a long time so I can finish the book, but with this book I was able to concentrate and really focus on what I was reading. Every chapter was a cliffhanger. The way Eleanor took all the gossip and laughing surprised me. She just kept going and tried to make friends. At the beginning it didn't make sense, but I just comfortably fell into the book when I found out how Eleanor reacted, and when I felt all the sensitivity and pressure in this girl's life. I think Cathleen Twomey wrote this with all her heart, and tried to relate the joy and pain of the life of a teenaged girl."
4,Not Too Bad,"This wasn't her best book, but it was okay. As the other reviewer mentioned, the points on Voodoo were a bit off, but I really wasn't too overly concerned enough with those details to look them up at the time. To me, it was just a decent thriller. I enjoyed it, but don't remember it being quite as good as her other books. Still, it was fun and kept me glued to my seat so I'd recommend it. It's part of my collection."
1,horrible just horrible,"this paperback ""book""is only about the thickness of a VERY thin magazine you can read it cover to cover in about 10-15 minutes. i was not made aware of this beforehand or i wouldn't have purchased it ...VERY DISSATISFIED :-("
4,Check out page 10!,"Awesome photos, including one on page 10 I haven't seen anywhere else. If you look closely, you can see Annie's nipple thru her outfit!! Mmmmmm--I can imagine victorian Annie blushed and was mortified and wanted to destroy the photo, but her husband grinned and kept the picture himself! I wonder...."
4,La Dolce Vita,"In Jennifer Louden's latest book, The Comfort Queen's Guide to Life, Louden goes beyond the concept of balance straight to the heart of living the good life, La Dolce Vita, from the inside out. Although Louden gives suggestions for pampering the mind, body and spirit, and asks us to do away with self-imposed obstacles, she reaches down into the heart of the matter: building a quality life from the essence of who we are instead of externally ""rearranging the furniture"" in the hope that it will create genuine contentment. Louden adds sass, humor, wisdom and a dose of self-love for a wonderful dialogue on living in harmony with our essential Self! Enjoy!"
1,"Precious, self-indulgent psychobabble","I too couldn't resist the title, and was hoping for something a little more practical. I guess. But the whole ""Comfort Queen"" as a literary device got really tiresome after about the first chapter. Guess I didn't realize it was quite the genre it is (femimist spiritualality stuff). While I am a feminist, and spiritual, this one just didn't connect with me."
4,Dreamy,"The outcast is back, and this time he has a friend from the 'real world'. The story is more rewarding and faster pasted than book one. It develops some interesting strategic fights and insights into the land. The development of Mhoram and his insights make for some interesting reading. The Lords have been hampered by their blind allegiance to the Oath of Peace? What does this really mean. The best of the first series."
4,Donaldson continues and grows the story,"The explores further the link between Covenant and the land. The book builds further on Covenants character and the world is expanded beyond the scope of the first chronicles. If you liked the first chronicles, the second is a most read.I recommend the book, although there again are some odd and unfortunate mistakes in the tranfer to e-book."
3,a filler,"a neccessary bridge between the bane and the excellent conclusion of a power that preserves, but not up to the level of these two. slower and no where near the suspense or convoluted story line of the other two novels of this series.mr donaldson redeemed himelf in the end of this trilogy a did thomas covenant."
1,"You've got to be kidding! Protagonist, Covenant, is a worm!","I can't believe all the positive reviews on this book/series. I have struggled through Book I and Book II holding onto scant hope that the author would somehow redeem the main character, Thomas Covenant. He is an unlikable, egocentric, cowardly, whiny, sniveling, and I'm afraid, unredeemable worm. Try as I might I can't like him. I don't care if he lives or dies. I can't even feel sorry for him. I've read quite a bit of fantasy, some very good, some not so good but this is really awful. I'm afraid that I would find the author's style to be quite tedious even if I did like the characters. Do yourself a favor and read George RR Martin, Guy Gavriel Kay, Tad Williams, almost anyone else, but don't bore yourself with the Unbeliever"
2,A very unimaginative series,"You can also read my review of the series in my review of the 1st book. Basically, I just want to restate how un-impressed and how boring this un-inspiring series was. Donaldson focuses so heavily on his writing style and his portrayal of a one-dimensional self-pitying Covenant that he forgot to write a story which would captivate his audience. Instead he writes a very rudimentary, unimaginative, predictable plot with flat unbelievable characters. My suggestion is not to waste your time reading this series as I did."
5,The Illearth is NOW,"The Illearth War, by Stephen R. Donaldson is the second installment of the 1st chronicle of the book of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever. I for one, am generally not a fantasy reader but was definitely hooked from the first book! The second book is even better. Thomas is recalled to the Land once again, to continue the battle against the legions of Lord Foul. In Illearth, we meet new characters and are reaquainted with some of the original heroes. All the characters come alive and the plot is tightly woven into a cohesive epic. Thomas' doubt continues in this book but our anti-hero gains knowledge on the power he holds and begins to understand the dilemma he faces. A few of the better reviewers pointed out that in the chronicles, is a very powerful statement on the human condition. A must read!"
4,Awesome,"O.K. great book right here. but the ending is a little sad. i can't tell you because that would ruin what happens right? RIGHT! i say you should read this book A.S.A.P. it is sooooo good. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because that title is reserved for the most awesome series of all times. THE GOLDEN COMPASS, THE SUBTLE KNIFE, THE AMBER SPYGLASS. best you can get. but this book ranks pretty close for me. give it a try. i bet you'll like it"
2,Too much the whining anti-hero,"I read this series when it first arrived on bookshelves at the suggestion of some well respected book reviewers. While it was imaginative and certainly well written, I really could barely stomach the constant whining and under-achieving of the main character. In the genre of heroic fantasy you expect the lead figures to step up to the plate more often than just once at the end of the novel after almost everyone around them has suffered enormously. If you want to read a good anti-hero, I'd suggest giving this one a miss and read Moorcock's 'Elric' series. Far faster paced and a challenged character that actually makes an effort, which to me is far more entertaining."
3,The Illearth Bore,"Though this book has its good points, it seems the majority of it is a depressing march across the Land. This is definitely the worst of the six books in the Covenant series, but it's worth getting through to get to the rest of them. Donaldson is not immune to the common failings of fantasy writing, such as giving people or places stupid descriptive names, but that's about the only shortcoming throughout the whole series. The end of the book is pretty good, and the parts between Covenant and Elena are interesting to read. If you liked ""Lord Foul's Bane"" there is enough here to keep you reading into the third book. If you were only lukewarn on LFB, this one might lose you."
2,Boring,"After having forced myself to read the first book to the last page, I could not find the stomach to finish this one. As in the first volume, the main character is the only one which is carved with more than superficial detail, and the dramatic flow of the story is wrong. As a side note - I am not sure if Donaldson's intention was to describe the world from the view of a schizophrenic, but if it was, Joanne Greenberg did a better job with ""I never promised you a rose garden""."
3,Parent Friendly,this is a great CD because it is parent friendly. The kids like it because it is from the movie and we like it because it is actually good music.
3,sound track Fair,"Tracks 3,5 & 10 were best song rtracks on the whole cd. I wish theyed put thoses 3 songs on a cd with other disney songs which would be much better. Id say thoses 3 tracks is what saves this cd from getting 1 star rating."
5,Driving music for a driving movie,"""Cars"" so far has been my favorite movie of the year and the music was no small part of my reason. The producers managed to create an atmosphere with their music and scenery that brought the whole experience of the movie to life. This soundtrack is a great mix of classic and contemporary artists. We've got Chuck Berry's ""Route 66"" and John Mayer doing a great reprise. Overall, this is just a great, upbeat set worth keeping in your car's CD player for those winding s-curved roads!"
4,Cool Car Tunes!,"I love the compilation on this CD! Coming from a generation that heard the original ""Route 66"" and ""Life is a Highway"", these versions make me nostalgic. What's more, my children have been introduced to these songs as well and they sing along with me when I play the CD in the car. My son's favourite is ""Life is a Highway"" and my daughter's fave is ""Sh-boom"". Can you imagine your kids singing along to songs you used to listen to when you were young as well?! It just boggles the mind! Keep at it Disney - you just get better!"
3,a lot of instrumental tracks,"My son loves the song Life is a Highway and Route 66. I just wanted to download those two songs, but you have to buy the whole album to get Route 66. Overall, the songs with lyrics are good."
4,Great soundtrack... our son LOVES it!,"Any child (or adult) who loves this movie will love this soundtrack! Our three-year-old listens to it in our car every day (several times a day) and has learned all the words to the songs. One complaint -- it would've been nice to have some sound effects and sound bites from the movie in addition to just the music, particularly in the race scenes. Our son tries to say them while listening to the music, and sometimes asks us what happened at THIS part of the movie, who is racing HERE, etc. Very entertaining!"
4,"Good, but a little too country/western","My family LOVES a couple of the songs - Sheryl Crow's ""Real Gone"" and Brad Paisley's ""Life is a Highway,"" but several of the rest are just too mellow or country/western-style for our taste. But there's a pretty good remake of ""Route 66,"" as well as the classic original. All in all, it's worth the money just for those songs."
4,We love CARS!,"Bought this since every time my 3 year old son hears any Rascal Flatts song he asks for the 'Cars song.' LOL. We love it, there is a great variety of music but once you get to the middle to end of the CD it is a lot of instrumental/muzak stuff. We love it anyway. If you love CARS, you'll love this CD."
3,pixar cd,"Its a good cd but not sure there are as many ""catchy"" type of songs on the cd for children aged 4."
4,Fun for all to hear and dance to,"My son LOVES anything from the Cars movie but the music really gets him and the rest of us jamming in the car. I wish there weren't the couple of songs repeated but they're great songs. My son would rather hear the lyrical songs than the scores, which there are several on the CD. Overall a great collection."
5,"If you liked the movie, this is great!","My 4-year-old son is a Cars fanatic, and he loves all the music, too. I thought I was buying this CD for him, but I find myself listening to it in the car when he's not around, too. Great artists and great songs."
5,Excellent addition for the 'CARS' movie lover,"My daughter loves the 'CARS' movie and dancing and signing as the movie plays... so for Xmas we got her the soundtrack...She loves the CD just as much and loves to also dance, sing and describing the scenes for each song that plays (I can't even do that for every song!!)"
5,A must-have for everyone who loves Cars!,"This is all-in-all a really super soundtrack! I'm no fan of country music, but you don't have to be one to enjoy listening to the songs on this CD. Apart from all the great songs, what really stands out on this soundtrack are all the instrumental tracks. I listen to a lot of Disney soundtracks, but I usually get bored with the score tracks and skip them. Not so with the Cars sountrack. The instrumental tracks are fast and fun to listen to. They allow you to imagine the scenes from the movie in your head. The music from the racing scenes are especially a real listening experience. Every fan of Cars must get this soundtrack CD!"
4,Cars Soundtrack,"This CD is a mix of various country songs that were in the movie Cars. The songs are all great, the only complaint I have is that the second half of the CD is composed of the musical score of the movie. I thought there were more real songs from the movie that they could have put in instead, but I guess not. The score portion is pretty boring, but the rest of the CD is great."
4,Way better than this has any right to be,"EP's and b-side albums so frequently suck that I stressed about blowing hard earned cash for this, even if it was only $9. A Certain Trigger was maybe my top album of '05 so I was prepared for disappointment. While not matching the highs of ACT, there is nothing here of decidedly lower quality (save the demos, which are worthless). The production is a bit less dense and there is less of a ""wall of sound"" effect than on ACT which does make this sound a bit ""cheaper"" but this occasionally becomes a revelation like on ""Stray Talk"". Worth every penny."
2,"Poor transfer to DVD, not in original wide screen","Bought this collection from a brick and mortar store for my son. We both watch the show everyday on TV but when we watched these DVDs we noticed that they are full screen cropped. These newer episodes of this show are in wide screen so why would they produce full screen version DVDs. To make it worst many of the scenes are not panned right. While the shots look great in wide screen, many times the full screen crops shove characters to the side of the screen. Other scenes you can tell they where done originally in wide screen but due to the full screen crop, feel overly zoomed in."
4,"Fast, easy read.","I found the book an easy read, but had trouble getting a real feel for the horror of the war. I thought the book was a little short, perhaps because the author couldn't get any input from Sharon Lane, herself. Not as in-depth as I expected, but definitely worth reading if interested in women's roles in the Vietnam war."
1,Got something else...,I bought this from goHastings thinking that I got Guyver vol. 1 but instead I received a copy of the movie If These Walls Could Talk 2. horrible service.
4,The Guyver Goes Off,This is quite possibly the most thrilling Manga series I have yet to come across in my lifetime. The graphics are so good and the storyline is ace. Buy me now okay?
3,Give and Take.,"All in all, the DVDs are BAD my friends. The opening sequence is completely cut from the episodes, and replaced with this awful clip sequence of cuts from variouse episodes. It's not even a song, and it just makes you want to cringe. To make it worse, the Chapter cuts are done so badly, you can't even skip the bad opening without cutting in a quarter of the way through the episode. And the extra features are minimal if any.But, all in all, if this is the only way to GET Guyver on DVD, then it is a sacrifice that must be made. Aside from the few minor edits to the actual anime, it's still all there (even if you have to go looking through the extra features for episode 12.) If you don't want to keep rewinding through three episodes on your collection of 4 low quality VHSs, get it. Just be prepared to hit the Fast Forward as oppose to the skip on your remote."
4,Not the first of Richard Rose's books I would read,I would read the Direct Mind Experience or the Albigen papers before I read this book. Some interesting material about the transmission of spiritual experiences and the conservation of human energy.
3,Half decent B-movie romp with Bruce Campbell,"B-horror movie god Bruce ""Evil Dead"" Campbell is the main attraction of this Sci-Fi Pictures original, in which Campbell and Xena: Warrior Princess' Renee O'Connor star as opposing humans against devious, grotesque aliens hellbent on, what else, annihilation of all mankind. The special effects are about what you would expect from a Sci-Fi Channel original movie, and were it not for Campbell, this would just be another forgettable schlock-fest. All in all, Alien Apocalypse is worth checking out for fans of Campbell (and you all know who you are), but if you want to see a surprisingly great new film with Bruce, check out the recently released Man With the Screaming Brain, in which Campbell stars and directs as well."
1,"Worst movie ever? Wait, Mansquito is on next....","Just finished watching Alien Apocalypse, only because I never wanted to be tempted to see it again. Bruce Campbell did a spoof movie about himself and said - ""what can be worse, I did a movie in Bulgaria"". This was that movie. This movie is dying for a spoof soundtrack a la MST3000. If you like bad effects, bad acting and a worse script - this movie is for you."
3,Not to great,"If you are expecting Renee o Connor and Bruce Campbell like they were on Xena, think again. The film is not so very bad, but it's not great either."
2,this one was meant to be bad in a fun way,"Our hero upon return to earth years later dreams about the future world hailing him as the great healer returned to earth (even tho he is 'only' a D.O. because his grades were not good enough to be an M.D.) But earth is overrun with aliens who want him to be a slave, like everybody else. He and Kelly attempt to escape....eventually he is presented an opportunity to adjust a bad back in order to try to win the respect of the people. Did the adjustment work? Will the people follow him, as the great healer, and fight for freedom? Will he get the girl? Does he even want the girl after the aliens had some of her for lunch? You have to watch this stinker to find out."
3,i take it back.....,"earlier i gave a half decent review for this film. i just watched it again and realized that it is a very boring 3rd generation army of darkness re-make. the scifi channel is horrible. they kill everything great and replace gore and suspense with cheap sfx and horrible cartoony video game animation. this movie is best recommended for rental if you cannot catch it on scifi. i made the mistake of being a bruce campbell nut and buying it regardless. i do recommend ""man with the screaming brain"" that is a movie scifi didnt eff up. stick with army of darkness, evil deads 1 and 2, bubba ho-tep, and MWTSB.i recommened only bruce campbell die hard completists purchase this. if you want a guide on what NOT to get with bruce campbell in it, i say stay away from this one and maniac cop. they both are very boring."
3,Bruce does it again,"For the budget they had to work with, and the fact that they had to dub in most of the actors voices due to the fact that they filmed this movie in another country, this was a very entertaining enslaved human race by insect alien's film.The key factor was Bruce Campbell pulling off his usual stellar performance, he can pull any movie out of the crapper with his funny sarcasm and dry humor, the best part of this film is listening to the commentary while watching the movie the second time around, very funny and insightful.If you're a Bruce fan, I say buy this movie, but if you're not a fan, don't bother since it's not able to stand on its own without Bruce's support."
1,Embarrassing,"I'm sure there are worse movies, but not that I have seen. Some bad movies are at least campy and fun in that regard. This is just an embarrassingly bad movie. Bruce Campbell is known for campy. This is just bad. I got the movie based on Bruce Campbell being in it because I find lots of his other stuff fun, despite being cheesy in many ways. But that cheesiness is exactly what they're going for in these other movies. I am not sufre what anybody was going for in this movie."
3,This Sweet Word Freedom,"A team of astronauts finds different America they left forty years prior, destroyed civilization and something British-colony-pre-independence under a crude rule of ant-looking aliens.Brave doctor revolted against such a reality, mercilessly annihilating murderous strange creatures and their collaborationists.A fanny satire on some recent moral values is mixed with a sort of homoeroticism and horror."
3,Half-decent B-movie romp with Bruce Campbell,"B-horror movie god Bruce ""Evil Dead"" Campbell is the main attraction of this Sci-Fi Pictures original, in which Campbell and Xena: Warrior Princess' Renee O'Connor star as opposing humans against devious, grotesque aliens hellbent on, what else, annihilation of all mankind. The special effects are about what you would expect from a Sci-Fi Channel original movie, and were it not for Campbell, this would just be another forgettable schlock-fest, but thanks to pretty much him alone, the flick ends up being enjoyable. All in all, Alien Apocalypse is worth checking out for fans of Campbell (and you all know who you are), but if you want to see a surprisingly great flick with the man, you'd be better off checking out Man With the Screaming Brain instead."
4,Just give this movie a chance,"This movie isnt as bad as everyone makes it out to be.i mean give it a break it is a made for TV movie,were people expecting the same level of quality as a hollywood movie??bruce campbell delivers again in a role that was probably writen for him.his humor comes through various times in this movie.the gore was decent but the aliens at times do look a little cheap but again it was made for scifi channel.if your a bruce campbell fan check this one out but other people will either love it or hate,i for one thought it was good."
5,As advertised,"DVD in excellent condition, cover had rental sticker on it and was in good condition. Delievered within a matter of days. I have used this seller often in ordering used DVD's and have never been disappointed with thier items and speed of delivery."
1,very out of place,"This movie was made to be cheesy in a good way, but the humor was so bad that it made what could have been cheesy funny into just boring. Boring is never a good thing. There wasn't a single moving, funny, exciting, or entertaining moment in it. Then the movie decides to have the most poorly and inappropriately placed rape scene ever filmed. Was the director trying to ""be serious"" for a moment and ""add drama"" to this? The casual and inept way it was handled actually made it more offensive than anything else. Adding a rape is not how you add drama to a talentless movie."
1,OH MY GOD WHAT A HORRIBLE MOVIE>>,"Fly a kite, read a book, jump off a cliff....anything but watch this travesty. Horrible acting, horrible video, horrible, horrible. Don't waste your money."
1,So bad I almost cried.,"I love Bruce Campbell, but this movie is almost unwatchable. It just drags along... not funny, scary, clever... I will keep it because Bruce is in it, but I won't be watching it again."
4,"Good movie, but no WOW factor","I watched the movie because I think Renee O'Connor is brilliant and love the few things that I've seen Bruce Campbell in. The plot is pretty simple and the lead acting is great (as can be expected from these two), but I didn't find anything that really WOWed me. Once I got over that fact and realized that it was simply going to be a B movie, I found that I liked it for the most part."
4,Good introduction to Strauss,"I bought this CD in order to understand something about Strauss. I had no musical training and I had never been to a symphony. I thought this CD was great, especially for background music. Since there is no playlist, I will provide one here:Johann Strauss, Jr.-On the Beautiful Blue Danube Op. 314 ""Waltz""-Annen-Polka Op. 117Johann Strauss, Sr.-Radetzky March Op. 228Johann Strauss, Jr.-Pizzicato-Polka Op. 449-Vienna Blood Op.354 ""Waltz""-Sweetheart Waltz Op.418-Persian March Op.289-Wine,Women, and Song Op.333 ""Waltz""-Overture:Die Fledermaus ""Operette""-Perpetual Motion: A Musical Joke Op.257-Voices of Spring Op.410 ""Waltz""Total playing time: 64:25"
5,Must See,I can not understand why we are not showing daily videos like this series through our middle and high schools and universities.This video was my favorite of the season so far
3,Dream & Hope,"I really enjoyed this novel. One of my favorite aspects of running is sharing a dream and I found as I read through the pages of this novel the flames of the fire of that dream were ignited. We never run alone and this novel showed that. We run with our past behind us and our hopes and dreams at our side as we reach forward to the future, this Novel, like ""The Gift"" invited me to keep dreaming, knowing that others were dreaming and hoping of what the future can bring. I really enjoyed this simple novel."
2,"I might have a ""defective"" Pooh.","We gave this to our 21 month old on Christmas morning. It worked well in the box and she was quite delighted with it. However, Pooh will stop walking in mid-stride and will not turn back on for hours. I have already changed the batteries once--15 minutes after taking it out of its box. When he does walk, he doesn't go very far. It's a shame because she seems to like him and wants to cuddle him all the time. I might bring him back to the store for an exchange. Maybe we just received a ""defective"" Pooh."
1,Pooh broke in two weeks.,Our one and a half year old grandaughter loved this toy however it stopped walking after two weeks of use. She was not abusive to the toy. Just normal use.Buy something else that will last.
3,Cute but problematic,"At first my 7 month old son was afraid of it but as the batteries began to wear out, it wasn't so intimidating. The music was softer and Pooh didn't stomp so loudly. There was a day when Pooh had a meltdown. His words and music cycled randomly and made no sense and then he turned himself off. I thought he was possessed. I immediately changed his batteries. It has not happened since. The toy is cute and I catch my son hugging it from time to time when he is not pulling Pooh around by his ear trying to make him play music. =-)"
5,Space Opera - Didier Marouani,"Simply Superb! Is a renewed and reloaded flavor of the French wave of electronic vangardists, the music is magnificent and a tribute to earth, space and universe! Thanks Didier for the Music. The greatest! if You still do not know SPACE (Blue Tears, Babe's Paradise, Air Force, etc) You do not know what You've been missing."
3,Wanders a bit,"This book includes some fascinating material on the number 13 and associated superstitions (13 at a table, Friday the 13th, etc.) and puts it in context as a relatively recent phenomenon. For the most part the writing is very engaging and the author has included lists and illustrations. Unfortunately the book also strays from the central subject at points, making these parts seem like something to get through rather than part of the whole. On the other hand, I do enjoy the fact that he placed the wiccan movement and its associated superstitions (and paranoid delusions) in context as a recent fabrication as well.Overall, well worth reading just for the research."
1,Garbage bins are very flimsy,"Purchased this garbage truck for my son and I was very disappointed. Within 3-4 minutes of playing, both garbage bins clippings that hangs on to the rear of the truck broke. That piece of plastic on the garbage bin is very flimsy. I will not recommend this product."
3,Over-rated for speed.,"I guess I was expecting miraculous speeds, but if there is a speed increase you won't notice it. If you really need or want increased speed SSDs are probably the way to go."
4,The On-Purpose Business,A great read for anyone that is after a book that can give them some advise about how to be a good leader and manager. If your business is lacking that something then this is the book to read.
1,Avoid this and find ProSobee Lipil,"According to the description of this item, it is Enfamil ProSobee Lipil.However, it was not ProSobee Lipil that could be purchased anywhere.I could not find the word ""LIpil"" on the each canister.It seems to be an older product (i have never seen it before)."
4,Convenient!,It is so hard to find this formula where I live. So convenient to get this in bulk online. I chose this formula for my baby because he wasn't doing well with my breast milk. He is doing fine doing fine now and is a happy baby : )
3,Temptations Motown's greatest hits,"I was extremely disappointed with this CD. The group on the cover might have inherited the name of Temptations but clearly do not possess the vocal quality of the original. Then to add more disappointment, some of the songs have been revised, not remastered but changed by tempo. Purchasing this was a big mistake on my part.I do not recommend this particular CD to anyone who values the sound of the original group."
3,Lovely but a disapointing Talia:-(,When I looked on the internet Talia was beautiful!Two days later when I went to the store she was the ugliest!I was very disapointed.:-(
2,not fun,I am a bratz fan but I do not like Lil bratz because I have three and a playset and never play with them so I would recommend Polly Pockets though I am eleven and still play with them.
1,a big no-no for your child,"these dolls are downright stupid! any parent in their right mind would not give their child one of these slutty, ugly and ridicules looking dolls. i wouldnt even say there ""dolls"". they look more like trolls or gremlins from mars.they set a bad example for young girls. i dont think a parent would appreciate it too much if their child goes to school one day with a shirt that is 5 inches above their belly button and a skirt that exposes everything BUT their private parts, and make-up that makes them look like a clown. all because of a doll. my, my, my what is this world coming to. i strongly suggest buying your child a myscene or barbie doll instead of one of these ""trolls"" thanks for reading my review.p.s. PLEASE dont get one of these for your child. it will be a big mistake. pleease."
5,"different sound than previous blessid, just as good","I live in a suburb of Cinci and have been following this group since they were only local. I've always loved their stuff and was particularly charmed by their ballad style. They've altered that for this album, though... and the result is amazingly GREAT. Pop culture references are fun, and the music is definitely more upbeat. I hope that with this radio-play-friendly album they finally get all of the recognition that they deserve. I also hope that they have better luck with their new record company than they have had with past ones. If it could just stay in business long enough to promote this terrific album..."
4,A CDthat doesn't Blow,"This CD is really good. ""Hey Leonardo"" is a very cool song. Sure it might sound a little like Third Eye Blind's ""Graduate"", but it definitely has it's own style of mixing all the types together. I bought this CD and have been Loving it ever since. It is relaxing and pumps you up all at the same time."
2,A disappointment,"When I got Blessid Union's second CD, I loved it and couldn't stop listening to it. So I didn't hesitate to run out and buy ""Walking off the Buzz"" as soon as it came out. Boy, was I disappointed. I didn't find any of the songs meaningful or memorable--I could hardly stand to listen all the way through. I would recommend one of their earlier two CD's instead; steer clear of this one!"
1,ist hier mein zusammenfassendes,"Ich denke, daß amazon saugt. Sie haben einen sehr sehr langsamen Service. Aber sie haben eine populäre Web site. Dieses ist kein sinnvoll. OH-... die DIGITALSCHALLPLATTE..., Es war okay."
3,Average - talent but nothing to show for it,"Stone Glass Window and That's the girl are okay, but overall a huge disappointment. Great sound, but all the songs sound alike. And what's with the lead singer? Can't he find a different style? Sounded like he was passing a stone while singing every song! Overall, this is mediocre bubblegum. Buy it used, if at all."
1,you've gotta be kidding!,"Oh no...that ""Hey Leonardo"" has to be one of the worst songs I've ever heard. The last thing the world needs is a Third Eye Blind ripoff, especially one as awful as this. Yuck!"
1,"Oh, man...","This is the most half-witted band of the 90's. The Leonardo song is idiotic, and it goes down hill from there. Hey, maybe these guys are robots manufactured by their record company?"
5,"If you like these guys` other songs, you`ll love this!","Right, so I go to the shop and my eyes fall on this CD, ""walking off the buzz"". I think to myself, hey, didn`t these guys sing that ""hey leonardo"" song? Man, i really like that song, let`s buy the album..... Right, flash forward. I`ve just listened to the CD once, and i`m like, well, at least I got ONE decent song. Then I play it again, and again and all of a sudden, i`m getting a headache trying to decide which of the songs is my favourite. This CD is amazingly good. It easily has some of my favourite songs of all time on it. It`s just....magical. I love it, ilovitilovitilovit."
5,WoW they have talent!(westdog13bh@mailcity.com),If this song hey leonardo isn't on the the top ten 4 the songs theres gotta be somethin rong i mean theres not much music thatu can say ill listen to it without fast forwarding 2 a better song except this. WOW i cant stop singin and playin it over & over again.
5,Cool,"The song, ""Hey Leonardo"" is the best. Listen carefully and you might pick up a rather sarcastic message or moral about material items. I like it a lot."
5,THIS CD ROCKS MY WORLD!!!!,"I bought ""Walking Off the Buzz"" after hearing only one song--Hey Leonardo. Usually when I do that I end up hating the cd but I love every song on this cd. It's perfect for people who are looking for good music but also meaningful lyrics. Plus these guys are just great people!!"
4,Pretty Good,"This CD is good. ""Hey Leonardo"" is the best track on there. Most of the other songs sound alike, especially the slow ones. The CD gets old after you hear it a few times. Overall, It's pretty good. I would buy it again."
4,Substantial story...,"But it was inconsistent and choppy...the story line moved with speed in some areas and slowed way down and plodded along in others. The plot was unexpected and different, but was a very good read."
2,The stories seem half-finished,"Not only do most of these stories follow the cop-out of ""throw enough dysfunction at the wall and hope it's shocking and/or angsty enough to stick and seem meaningful and interesting"" but they're also a tease.In writing workshop, I learned that every story has to have a problem (of which there are plenty in these), a climax (mostly lacking) and a resolution (of whatever kind, even if nothing really gets resolved. In this case, lacking in almost every story).Most of these stories just end, often when things just seem like they're about to happen. Most of the characters blend together. I didn't care about them, and the stories didn't feel finished. A bunch of kids in trouble, broken homes, drugs, sex, violence and incest doesn't make good writing unless the story is complete and compelling. To me it just felt like an angsty laundry list."
5,Review,"This laurel & Hardy collection is just a few of their classic performances.The Big Noise have a very young Robert ""Bobby"" Blake, and Jitterbugs has the classic turning water into gasoline with a pill.This was a belief that it was possible to do in the war years back then.Great Guns puts the boys in the army with their employer who gets drafted. Great laughs.This would be a great addition to any Laurel & Hardy collection.I would recommend this one."
3,The Three Stooges and also Laurel and Hardy - early shorts,I bought these for our young boys as a bit of comedy history and they didn`t stop laughing - particularly over Stan Laurel - not really for adults though unless you are nostalgic. Great stuff.
5,feeling and form,This seminal work is out of print. I borrowed it from the public library but such was the demand for the book I could only have it for three weeks.Through Amazon I got a copy in good condition at a reasonable price.Very Pleased.Dave.
3,A little disappointed!,"I just received this grill pan, and used it 3 times in the first week to cook steaks and pork chops. The pan heats quickly and evenly. It looks great. It's heavy and appears to be well made. The non-stick claim is a bit of a stretch, however. The meat is easly removed from the raised cooking surface, but the small pieces of fat, seasoning, and meat juices get stuck in the crevices. It takes me a couple of minutes to scrape off the debris, even using a special non-stick scouring sponge. I have many other non-stick products that are almost clean after just rinsing alone. I like the pan, but I'm considering returning it, so I can try another product that might require less work."
5,Anolon Grill Pan,"I bought this grill pan as I got rid of my old G. Foreman grill. I was thinking of getting a cast iron grill pan, but they could be hard to clean. This pan along with the whole line of Anolon Advanced is highly recommended. I also have the stir frypan. They heat up well for being non-stick and anodized aluminum. Also very easy to clean. I received a good price on Amazon, free shipping and very happy with it."
2,Way too complicated for little girls to enjoy!,"This game is just too hard for little girls to enjoy, and I doubt even middle school aged girls could play alone. I'm a grown woman and a TEACHER and I became frustrated with the directions and all the little things you have to remember to play. It's just way too confusing and not very fun at all. We tried to play for about forty five minutes, and it was just NOT FUN. The cards make no sense, and the whole ""adding skill points"" is to hard to remember. Don't buy it."
4,"Good book...if you do the ""lessons"".","This is a great book in many ways. I feel its a good ""approach"" to learning to draw figures if you do not have a ""background""in figure drawing. I like the ""loose"" approach also as the figure is ""fluid"" and not static. I tend to draw in a very stiff wayas I am trying to get proportions so correctly. This approach frees you from being too stiff!"
4,Reid Rocks,The author doesn't disappoint. Full of helpful technique for rendering the figure in watercolor plus many clear illustrations by Charles Reid. I felt my money was well invested after acquiring this book.
4,good not great,"I have read many instructional books on art and this one is good, however there is an older book by Charles Reid that has much better paintings. That said this book though lacking is as many quality examples goes much more in depth into the process of paining the human figure. He has excellent demos of his technique and a variety of different approaches."
3,An Emotional Journey!,"""Water Bearer Rhymes by Cynthia Memmolo is a book of poems divided into many sections: Life, Writing, War, Creatures, Nature, Love, Holiday/Spiritual, General and Sensual. The poems are deeply personal, heart-felt and reflect the author's feelings about various experiences in her life, including the unfortunate death years ago of her four-month old son from SIDS.

5,Start Dancing with this DVD,"Do you want to dance? Start here. I guarantee you; this DVD is exceptionally well done. As instructional material goes Trautman and his wife are incredibly easy to learn from. I watched the ""Slow and Romantic Dance Sampler"" and was really impressed with the clarity of instruction and the helpful comments on dance etiquette. The camera angles shift between the male and female perspectives which is really interesting. You will learn enough of the basic dance moves to feel confident on the dance floor. I would eagerly recommend this to anyone who wants to get a jumpstart on their dance moves. Honestly, I believe you could watch this one night and be out dancing the next. It gives a man immediate skills he can use the same weekend. If you want to dance, start here."
5,Danze Fairmont Shower Trim Kit,Difficult installation in our vacation home vs. easy in our main house; dependson current set up. This is the exterior kit only. You may have to purchase theinterior wall valve. The color is more an antique copper so if you have other ORBthat is dark be careful. Santec's antique victorian copper is a close match if you can't find Danze parts. Once installed Danze is durable and beautiful.
4,A great contemporary tale of romantic suspense.,"By day, Cottonwood Hall was an eerie, whispering monument to dread. By night, terror took shape and walked the dark hallways of the psychiatric rest home housed in an antebellum mansion... and frightened the unlucky to death. Nurse Amanda Matthews worried that her patients weren't getting well. Instead, they were mysteriously dying. Beneath the moaning cottonwoods, there was only one man she could trust. Only Dr. Len Percy had the strength to share the dreadful secret of Cottonwood Hall. A good read! In the style of Mary Higgins Clark, you will never guess the ending!"
4,Baby Animals - Catch Me If You Can VHS Video,"Description from the back of the cover:In filming wildlife, the most enjoyable days are spent filming the young. Catch Me If You Can has two fun-filled animal programs, ""The Predators"" and ""The Grazers"". In ""The Predators"" you will enjoy the delights of watching the young bears, foxes, coyotes, wolves and otters in their never ending tussles. In ""The Grazers"", you will see the magic of Dall sheep lambs bounding up a mountain, elk calves dodging in a game of tag, and bison calves butting heads. Play is important, and for each animal their never ending seemingly carefree antics will make you smile time and time again."
1,Wow. What a P.O.C.!,"I'm not an audiophile, so the sound is fine with me. My problem with this is the design of the cabling. I'm not a fan of the assymetrical cord lengths. Besides the assymetrical cord, the worst part of airbuds is the rubberized cord. This material allows for the cable to easily tangle. If you are tempted to put your earbuds in your pocket, please be ready to spend a few mintues untangling them. Very frustrating."
1,These are exactly the same as Philips SHE 9501 except they are black and twice the price,These earbuds rock - great for women because you can just use the 1st half of the cord which is 0.6 meters long - I find that the standard 1.2 meters gets in the way when running etc. Also the cords are staggered so the cord for the right ear is about 3 inches longer then the cord for the left - I love these and I'm stocking up because I think Philips has discontinued this model
3,Little Disappointed,I do not like that the ear buds are two different sizes for the different ears. It was very disappointing.
2,sound?...word. design?...turd.,these sounds pretty good. i actually had to refit them in my ears so i could hear around work when i needed since they isolated somewhat decently when some one tried to talk to me. decent sound really. infact i would have kept these except...the one side being longer than the other is an idea to try but the designers should have seen how poor this is. the weight of the connection brings this design flaw to your attention as one side is always tugging. i tried multiple things and they're just annoying. and with this design you HAVE to have your musical device on your left.
2,Bad Sound !,"The sound is really one of the worst I have ever had. Not only the quality is bad, but even when you push the volume a little bit, the sound becomes unexpectably distorted."
1,Very mediocre sound,"I picked these up as a middle-of-the road solution between the high-end 50+ dollar buds and the typical 10 dollar buds or over the head earphones. I wanted something that sounded decent and would not fall out when running. They are extremely comfortable, but that's about as far as they go.They do absolutely nothing for blocking sound. Furthermore, my previous set of 12 dollar hook-over-the-ear headphones sounded much better. These sound tinny and definitely like they're coming from a plastic case. The sound is a bit distant, like listening to MP3s from a cheap pair of computer speakers that weigh less than a few ounces. The bass response is fair, but otherwise, the mids and highs are muddy and blurry like listening to a nice AM radio. For the cost, definitely look for a better buy elsewhere."
4,Great for the price,"The sound from these headphones are great, as well as the small size. They represent the entire sound spectrum very evenly. They also have very good noise canceling due to their shape. In the airplane, I was able to use half the volume I usually do to hear my music over the engines.They will work well if you are careful with them, since they are fairly fragile- They have pretty thin cables and the connections are small. It's a little scary to pull the extension wire away from the main wire; it feels as though it might break. The sides are of unequal length, which I don't particularly care for, so I just used the small twist tie from the packaging to bundle up some of the cord from the longer side to make them even.Buy these headphones if you want good sound for a good price but will not be using them under harsh conditions, i.e. sports or constant daily use."
2,Ugly and Uncomfortable,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet... I purchased these earbuds over a year ago to replace another(different) pair. After over a year of wearing these I kept noticing how the plastic extends from the bottom of the bud which makes the piece fit awkwardly and stick out at an angle over the earlobe. Also, with extended usage(up to an hour or more) I noticed HOW uncomfortable these buds really are... to the point of causing my ears to hurt around where the bud fits. I started looking for earbuds that didn't have the plastic extending and fit comfortably. I found them... Sony MDR-EX32 earbuds. I'm not saying buy these buds but the moment I put them in my ears and played a song, I immediately(!) noticed how much better the sound quality and comfortability was over these Phillips. I don't want to be bias and say, ""Don't buy Phillips"" but DO NOT buy these earbuds! Definitely give any type of Sony earbuds a look before you look to buy Phillips."
4,Great Headphones,"Every headphone in this price range comes with practically identical silicone thingies, so it's not really worth it to judge this type of headphone based on comfort (I find them very comfortable anyway).I use these to play my electronic drum kit silently, and the response is great on mid-tones (toms), treble (hi-hat), and bass (...bass) with no need for tweaking or equalization on my part. I can practice for hours with these things in and have no complaints as for comfort.They sound great plugged into a laptop/iPod/etc. as well!Only reason I gave it a 4 was because I had a Sony pair of headphones a couple years back that were better than these for roughly the same price, so I know it can be done; alas, Sony doesn't make the same ones anymore!"
4,Small BUDS for small ears,I had been looking for small ear buds that would be comfy in my small ear holes & these 'fit' the bill.
2,"wow, crappy.","that was my initial reaction. every aspect of the design is poor. its a shame that $30 cant buy you a decent pair of these things. i guess the technology to get good sound inside your ear is complicated. the sound is very mediocre. ""turbo bass?"" thats a pricey joke imo. they are fairly comfortable but i dont see them lasting very long. the cable insulation is so thin it almost ripped when i tried to pull it out of the package. the stems of the earbuds protrude from the case so they are not very protected if you shove them in your backpack. who knows what your expected to do with the cable, crumple it into the little satchel they give you? if you only want to spend >$30 you can find yourself some very nice over the ear-phones but it looks like you cant cheap out on the in ear stuff..."
3,Not durable.,"While the sound quality of these earphones is exceptional, buyers beware. The durability of these earphones is pathetic. The first pair I bought went out after about 6 months, the second pair went out after around 2 months. Each time the left earphone quits producing sound. Very irritating."
3,Not good for cycling / running,"The drivers sound good and this ""extra-bass"" thing is gimmicky ... i returned these because if using them outdoors or exercising, they become a wind-tunnel and create disturbances in the sound quality. good for desk/sedentary use. I ended up buying some sony in-ear buds."
4,Excellent sound Quality But!!...,"... The Only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star.. yup you guessed it just like the previous posts the cord tangles badly. Other than that its nice crisp sound a hell of a ""BOOM"" Bass. I use headphones everyday at work mainly and it shuts out all outside sounds. And I use it while i play poker. I would most definitely recommend this product. But Be warned the cord is lengthy which is great but it tangles up very easy and thats what really s@%K$ !But for the price its a great Deal."
4,"Pretty good, with a few issues","I bought these the other day when my old Skullcandy earbuds crapped out on me. Overall, they aren't half bad for the price. Sound quality is great, with a nice deep bass that doesn't drown out the surprisingly crisp mids and highs. They are reasonably comfortable as well.There are some issues with these earbuds, however. The asymmetrical wiring design is kind of a pain, probably because I'm not used to it, but oh well. The actual wiring itself is sort of a pain too, as it tangles frequently. They also don't feel very secure in the ear, regardless of which rubber tip size is used. This may or may not be a real problem, as they have yet to fall out on me in action.Overall, are these worth it? Sure, if you're looking for a cheap pair of earbuds with good sound and can get past the few flaws. Those who want something higher quality should look elsewhere."
2,"Sound is fine, The wiring is horrible","Unlike most of the reviewers giving low scores, I had no problems with the audio aspect of this product. It was a fine fit in my ear as well. No, my problem is with the wiring. It is soo fine, that I was sure it would go bad. Well, sure enough, after about a month of use, the wiring started to deteriorate and cause the sound to drop out."
3,left ear bud stops working,"After some time, the left ear bud became very very very soft. Unless I turn it up to full volume and take the right out, I can't hear it. AND, I've had friends report the same problem..."
4,Not bad for the price,"I got these (model-she9500) at marshalls for only $10. For that price what a steal. I've seen them at different locations in L.A. area. I give it 4 stars because it lacks the clarity compared to other in-ear bud designs I own; Also, the wire is thin and flimsy that it can easily get tangled, attracts dust, and can kink if you are not careful with it. I do like that it has a lot of bass."
2,What were they thinking????,"I purchased these at another store and did not have to pay the $30 because of a labeling error, but even then that did not make up for the poor design of these. I have had problems of these slipping out of my ears as well. And then there is the different length of the cording leading directly to the earphones. Why would that make it a better design. Maybe I am missing something. I string the wire underneath my clothes when I am working in the lab so they won't hang around everywhere. Unfortunately with the mismatched cord length, everytime I move my head, the stupid earphones fall out and I have to remove my gloves to put them back in, a HUGE hassle when performing an experiment. The sound out of these is not the greatest either, I feel sorry for the people who paid full price for them. I am going back to my Koss ""The Plug"" which are cheaper and sound a whole lot better. I guess I have a back-up now if I ever lose the other ones."
2,Knock offs AT BEST,"I tried these because at the retailer where I bought them, they were 10-20 less than the sony fontopia in ear phones. ""TURBO BASS! Excellent clarity!"" Completely and udderly ridiculous. These headphones are terrible. They sit in the ear uncomfortably (the wire-tab that comes off the bottom presses on your ear), have a default volume that is too low, the clarity of highs and lows is awful, and are a FAR CRY from ""turbo bass"". Spend the 10 and get the Sonys. Definitely worth the money, great sound."
2,sony's better,it doesn't fit as snuggly as the sony fontopia headphones. they are only like 5 more dollars too. the headphone straps are designed poorly and makes it uncomfortable when doing anything except sitting still. wouldn't pay 10 dollars for them but the earbuds fit into sony's headphones so it wasn't a complete waste of money.
4,"Excellent Earbuds, Great Price","I've generally gone with Sony earbuds, but I switched it up this time since the wires frayed on the last two Sony pairs. These have been excellent so far; great bass (better than similar Sony models), and clear, crisp highs. I listen to a lot of music and a lot of audiobooks, and they provide good audio for both. They aren't quite as comfortable as the Sony ones, but they are by no means uncomfortable. I recommend them, especially at this price. We'll see how long the wires last; if they match or outlast the Sony ones, I will be very, very happy with my purchase.Also, on a side note, the little felt bag that comes with the earbuds is the exact right size to tote around a 3G iPod nano--a very nice side benefit."
5,"Good sound, cheap price","These are my first pair of in-ear earphones. I use the smallest ear piece. I think they are comfortable, and they sound very nice. The farther you jam them in, the better they get. I use them at work and at the gym (I don't run though, just lift). I'm thinking about getting an arm band for my ipod so I can just use the short version and not the extension. These sound infinitely better than the iPod default headphones.My problem with these is that they just refuse to wrap up nicely. The wires are slick and just don't stay put. This make them hard to tangle, which is nice, but it took me a while to figure out how to wrap them up so they stay. I prefer not to use the little jewelry bag that comes with them.For the price, I think these would be tough to beat."
3,Mostly OK...,"The headphones themselves are great. Sound quality is good. Fit is good. My problem is with the cord. If you wear your mp3 player on your waist, these are not for you. The headphones have an extension that allows to cord to reach to your waist, but it adds so much weight that it bounces around and is jostled to the point that it just isn't worth it. The plugs were literally yanked out of my ears on numerous occasions due to the swing and sway of the cord. If you wear your mp3 player around your arm, you should be OK as you won't need the extension at all. Personally, I prefer my mp3 player on my hip but have had to move it to my arm to accommodate the cord."
2,Bad cord material,"I've had several sets of Phillips earbuds, so I was surprised when I realized the material of the cord on these is very poor quality, it's like putty, gets kinks very easily (even right out of the package) and tangles too easily. Maybe Phillips went back to the better material of other Phillips buds I own and if they did, good for them. But I got a set I can barely use, which is a shame, because they do sound pretty good, hence the 2 stars despite the cord problem."
2,"Good sound, bad fit.","I bought these as a replacement for my stock I-pod headphones because my cat chewed them apart. These headphones sound great but never stay in your ear even without the extension. I never had this problem with the I-pod headphones. The extension, that is needed because they are to short without it, weighs them down and makes them fall out as well. They also look like they are sticking out of your ears and the cord tangles every time you take them off. I wouldn't suggest to anyone to buy these."
3,alright...,"These are ok, but my ears get tired after awhile (this hasn't happenned with other buds) and more disappointing was when i tried to run with these on... all i heard was the wind. oh well, not bad for the price but i'll have to find new ones"
5,Availible online from American Red Cross for Free,I had looked for this book in a cheaper print because American Read Cross prints are usually just a few dollars. This book is however full of color which is expensive to print. I did find on the American Red Cross website that the book is available online for Free and can be downloaded to a PDF.
2,A big disappointment,"Both characters and plot are over simplified and not one bit challenging. While the `Floaters' culture is well conveyed, everything else in this book is either well anticipated or utterly unconvincing. It is hard to believe that the author holds a degree in physics - any similarity to Gregory Benford, or any other author with a similar educational background, is really non existent."
2,"Bad Science, Adequate Story","For a book that is advertised as hard SF, it falls far short. There are numerous and pervasive errors in the science and engineering, many of which could have been caught by any reader familiar with the conventions of hard SF, and others that would have been caught by any competent person (layman) who is familiar with science on the level of reading the newspaper and magazines like Natural History and National Geographic.There are a fair number of word errors (spelling, word choice, etc) that should have been caught by a proofreader.There are general and specific problems with consistency and continuity, that (for me) affect the believability of the characters and story.I also was not convinced of the believability of some of the characters and situations.Decent story idea though. Save your money."
2,formula,"It was pretty much formula ""space sci-fi"". Some interesting ideas but if I squint a little, it could be any of 500 ""space"" sci-fi books I read in the 70s-80s."
1,Unbelievably bad,"This book is unbelievably bad on a number of levels. The characters are unbelievably immature, the plot is unbelievably coincidental, and the villain is unbelievably evil. ""Murphy's Gambit"" is written with all the sophistication of a ""young reader"" book. It kept reminding me of the Jedi Apprentice series, complete with an overabundance of exclamation points, only those books are deliberately written for 9-12 year olds. This book, however, was ostensibly written for adults. The description of life in zero-gee is interesting, if sexist, but it's not enough to save this book. And nine as a prime number? If this woman really has a master's degree in solid-state physics, the university should revoke it."
3,It's an abstract and not a detail.,"For all the no brain reviews that I have read just now there should be at least one that expresses the real intent of Murphy's Gambit, which was to present an abstract of the future and not to be misled by just a few mistakes. It was an excellent prelude to the real possibilities dealing with Astro-Physics which the author is very capable of handling and did so with expertise. The space ship presented a very real example of what is possible in Einstein's universe if the people who write reviews could just imagine, but they are too concerned with a glob of paint on a canvas when they should just back away and look at an excellent work of art."
2,Not what I expected but I'll take the blame.,I thought I was getting wine glasses to match what I already have. Turns out these are wine goblets ( as it says) and they are not the same. Unfortunately the picture makes the glasses and goblets look the same. Bad news is they won't let me return them.
3,Item appreciated except for the packing,"I appreciated receiving the wine goblets, except for the fact that one of the two boxes had no packing holding the goblets, so one was broken in shipping. But they were the goblets I had seen in a store."
3,ordered for a friend,A friend requested this item and I ordered it for him. I do not have a personal need for this product. Appeared to be of good quality
1,"If I was Stanley, I wouldn't want my name on this thing","This thing is very poorly made which is shocking since it says ""Stanley"" on the side. Mine went into the trash a week after using it. It sticks as it retracts; it doesn't always retract all the way, so you have to push it in; it's loud (cheap spring scrapes on the metal tape); and I should point out that it doesn't lock. There are other quality portable measuring tapes here at Amazon that are definitely much better quality."
1,not dishwasher safe,"Although marked 'dishwasher safe' on it, these covers did not fit my KA bowls after washing in the dishwasher at moderate temperature (not the hottest program)."
5,Filmed locally in my hometown area,"The movie was somewhat of a local hit back in the Sharon, PA area. heard a lot about it. Finally got around to owning it. I dunno why it wasn't very sucessful. I thought it was good"
3,Different,"Not the typical Patrick Swayzee type movie, but very good if you listen in between the lines."
4,Great storyline...,"I don't normally like movies with this amount of sentimentalism in them, but I have to make an exception here because I like the characters and storyline. The main character (Tiger Warsaw - played by Swayze, of course) seems pretty legit, and so do most of the other characters. I think the movie comes off pretty well and the people in it reminded me of people I've actually known - even if a few elements of the movie feel a little contrived."
3,very good story-line,"This movie was never viewed in theaters outside of the area (Sharon, PA) where it was filmed. Being a Patrick fan, I searched until I was able to purchase it. Patrick does an excellent job of portraying the son who returns home after a long absence to make amends with his family. The production and color were not the best, but I really liked the story."
4,Small town people will get this movie,"While admittedly not one of his best films, this is a decent movie. I think it helps if you're from the type of area where the movie was filmed. It helps you to ""get it"" a little better. I think a true Swayze fan owes it to themselves to at least give it a chance. I am actually from the town where it was filmed and had the pleasure to cross paths with Patrick on one occassion while he was out walking his dogs that he brought with him while filming. He is a true gentlemen and I wish him well in his ongoing cancer battle."
1,Why did he do it?,"Why did Patrick Swayze agree to do this train wreck of a movie? It was horrible! The story doesn't make a lot of sense. It is never made quite clear why his character had to leave town. The story had me thinking that he raped his own sister. Again, I may be confused from the fact that I was trying to stay awake.Swayze's character is also pathetic in the fact that he leaves and comes back like 3 or 4 times in this movie (or so it seems). Before I knew it, he was sitting in a church with his family and big stupid smile on his face. I remember thinking - what just happened?Not to trample on Swayze's memory (I loved Road House and Dirty Dancing), but the man should have never agreed to do this movie. It was just terrible."
4,A gift from a talented gentleman.,"I have enjoyed most of the movies I have seen with Patrick Swayze. I have several of his and all are very good. This one is not as good as some he had made but still worth watching. Would I purchase this one if I had seen it or heard about it before I bought it, probably not.Mr. Swayze was a very good actor and we will miss him and his movies. I really think that GHOST was his very best with Dirty Dancing next, also Road House is really close behind. Don't miss seeing them at least once."
3,Tiger warsaw,Great movie with the late patrick swayze. the title is also very hard to find. glad i finally found it.
2,Superb Balance - But Flawed,"I use this cleaver regularly when cutting chicken up including chopping through bones when prepping for stock. It works very well, is a great weight, heavy enough to cut without becoming tiring. I have brought it with me half way around the world, which should speak for it usefulness.It chops bones, bangs through half frozen carcasses when necessary and is worth every penny.Above is my original review, now I must amend that. The cleaver broke in half. No, I didn't use it drive nails or cut rebar. The thickest bones it ran into would be in a pork chop. Not even a thick cut pork chop at that. But it split in half just above the handle just where the transition to the blade occurs. Quite surprising and totally unacceptable for a product of this price range. If you see one cheap at a yard sale, buy it. Otherwise, don't bang your bank balance too deep.I have, sadly, totally revised my view of Global and their quality assurance."
4,Global Cleaver,"This is awesome knife! It's got good heft, and it's more than sharp enough. Being a Japanese knife, the steel is a lot stronger than german knives so the edge will stay sharper longer, but will take more work to bring it back during the sharpening."
5,Wonderful Gift!,"I gave as a gift. They LOVE it, the knife is 'heavy' and makes chopping through bones easy. It has a great design, when I was able to use it ... I realize it is worth the price."
1,Pay Pal Sucks!!!!,"To Whom It May Concern,I tried to order an item from you. Pay Pal gave me the run around for well over an hour. I will never use Pay Pal again as long as I live, not with a gun to my head. If you continue to use Pay Pal, I will not be ordering from you.My concern is for you. I'm sure you're trying to do the `safe' thing for your customers by using Pay Pal. However, it is because of Pay Pal that you lost business.My hour and a half lost is/was not worth the savings on the item I was trying to buy from you. Perhaps you should find another way of accepting payments other than through Pay PalSincerely,Scott W. Swigart"
5,Worked GREAT!,"This tool was useful when I needed to serial into my Soekris computer, and my SUN Ultra-1 machine. Both running OpenBSD. I was using it to administer the machines with a Windows laptop, which had no serial cable. This connector saved the day! The installer is a little odd, it is an EXE, and you have to sort through the Driver disk for the right one, as it has drivers for a good amount of other items. Match the model number on the package.The installer had some issues installing the drivers on one of my machines. It did not do anything for a long time, and then came up and worked fine. I enjoyed the product, and think it is well worth the buy!"
1,Does not Work,"I tried getting this to work with my vista laptop, no go! Then I tried with windows XP, no go! Now its uselessly laying around in one of my cabinets. The drivers provided were very outdated and I could not find any good drivers any where else. Useless, not worth getting, I will consider changing this review if the Person who sold this to me comes up with some good drivers. The reason why I know its not my hardware that is not working is because I tried a different Serial to USB cable and it works just fine. If someone knows where I can get drivers then please let me know..."
3,"Don't know, never worked","Who knows, this is probably a fine product, but the drivers do not work with Windows Vista. At least I couldn't get them working.I needed this to connect a PWS to my PC, and I could never get it to work. I was running Vista Ultimate. I am not a tech geek nor am I a slouch. I know what I am doing. I would just look elsewhere or get confirmation there are Vista drivers."
3,generic USB to RS232 adapter,"Hello,I got this cheap adapter to connect my MacBookPro to some serial hardware i havelying around. i haven't jet tested it in my MacBookPro, but i have had success running thison Linux. The used Chip set pl2303 is recognized immediately and i found a OS X driver by the chip setvendor (Polific).I am not a Windows user since a few years, but hearing all the trouble you are going through with thisadapter, you might want to try to get the vendor drivers from there website:[...]might do the trick for you.good luck!"
4,Needs a little improvement.,"This is a good compilation of the 2005 Warped tour bands. It could use some improvement though. They could have chosen a much better Dropkick murphys song and a much newer Fall Out Boy song first of all. I'm very pleased with the Millencolin song though. The Armor for sleep and Strung out songs are also very good. It is okay overall, but they used ""Note to self"" by From first to last on the 2004 comp! The song by The Matches also could have been way better too. One song I really like is the MXPX song. It's pretty good."
3,Good Bands... Bad Songs,"I love almost all of the bands on here, and bought this CD with high hopes.The chosen songs for this compilation, however, are below par. I can think of dozens more songs for almost every band that would have reflected their talent a lot better. If you're new to these bands, then you won't appreciate this album either, since only one or two of the songs are any good or do the bands justice.If you really want a punk rock compilation, then I'd get something from the Rock Against Bush series, or Punk-O-Rama. This one really doesn't cut it, not in terms of their choice of bands, but in terms of their choice of songs."
1,"some good bands, not enough to cure the headaches","Milencolin, dropkick murphys, the offspring, pennywise, all good bands, but drowned in this sea of p.u.s.s.y a.s.s b.u.l.l.s.h.i.t, they lose all their bite, and it causes me pain to see them on the same track list as posers like underoath and fall out boy"
4,ok but crapo bands,"I would have agree with Jeda. warped is full of crapo emo screamo bands. Its not about punk anymore its about crap music. This cd is ok, they could of done better maybe some whole wheat bread, and tusnami bomb, but oh well. the one song i hate on this cd the most is track 7 Gogol Bordello - Start Wearing Purple. I sweare its the most annoying song ever ::erases song from cd:: omg i hate it.. but in a nut shell warped tour gets worse and the cd gets craper.. but its still worth the 8 or 9 bucks."
2,A few good bands but WAY to much emo/screamo,"This is an okay compilation however its far from the best. If your looking for good punk music you wont find much of it here. Heres a list of the bands i thought were pretty goodThe OffspringPennywiseStrung OutStrike AnywhereMxPxMillencolnNo Use For A NameStreet DogsPlain White T'sI really hate emo music, And it's not like a really really hate all screamo/hardcore music its just that i really don't wanna hear like 40 songs in arow of it it almost sounds the same.Hopfully next year there will be some more punkish bands on the tour such as Propagandhi, Nofx, Desendendents,Pennywise, Rise Against, Black Flag, Anti-Flag...etc"
2,"punk guy on cover, with one, maybe two punk bands of CD","yea, hmm, what can i say. justin sane, singer/guitarist from Anti-Flag on the front cover. and i think that may be george from the casulaties on the back cover. two punk bands, two good punk bands, and whats on the CD?...EMO. why advertise an emo cd with two punk people on the front and back cover? can you get any more controversial? i have to admit i do like some of the bands on the CD, good songs, good bands. i like it back in the day when there actually was punk bands on a CD that advertised punk people on the covers. if was justin sane, i'd be so ashamed to have my face on the cover of this CD. ever since last year, this CD, no tour, has gone down the drain, more and more crappier bands, and more and more controversy. whoever made this tour/CD is only looking for money and thats all he cares about, he doesn't care about the music."
4,This is from the other side.,"This was very informative, written about the war from Japan's side. A lot of information most people would never know without reading this book or one like it. I spent a year in Japan in the early 50's, met a lot of Japanese men. The US Military hired many former Japanese as interpreters and security personnel. I never met one that admitted he fought American troops, only the British and Australians. Very interesting."
3,Brief!,"I think I was expecting more footage, what was there is very good, all is in color and most is footage I had not seen before. It's more of a brief overview of Japan during that time and more or less a collection of what looks like home movies. What I got was good, I just expected a little more footage, with that being said it's worth the watch."
4,"finally, we get the other side's point of view","JAPAN'S WAR IN COLOUR is a very basic showiing of Japan's lead into all out WW11 war. I found it a rather feebleattempt to create a rationale for the slaughter that was inflicted by their army, especially on China. there were manyglaring omissions of their brutality. However, a small amount of information, even overblown, is better than nothing.The fact that it was in color film that was not known to exist gives it a value in and of itself. If you are a history buffof WW11 it is worth viewing at least, if not owning."
5,Japan's War in Color,This is a well done documentary with loads of color footage that I had not seen before.
3,Very good footage but weak as documentary,"This documentary's strong appeal is the historical footage it contains but as a documentary, not very much different than the others of the same kind I have seen before."
3,"Amazing archival images, problematic presentation","The producers of this documentary (and others in the series) have obviously spent a great deal of time and effort in tracking down the remarkable color footage and restoring it. However, they've also made the decision to convert the original 4:3 images to 16:9 -- obviously to satisfy those who've already bought their widescreen TVs. This cropping of about a third of the image from the top and bottom of the frame results in the frequently painful butchery of the image. Since the whole raison d'etre of the series is to present these rare images (as documentaries, the programs are efficient but unremarkable surveys of their subjects), this mutilation seems inexplicable. The material itself is worth five stars, but the presentation drags down the rating."
3,Could be better,"This is one of the first documentaries about World War II that I've seen that focused on the Japanese side of things. The film is too short and isn't very in depth about it's subject. For example, the ""Rape of Nanking"" is only mentioned briefly and doesn't even begin to describe anything that happens during this incident.At about the 1:11 mark the Japanese have surrendered and the movie continues to describe what it was like after this for the Japanese. I'm glad they added this because most other documentaries probably wouldn't have even bothered.I felt the movie relied too much on quotes about the war to tell it's story.The film maker also seemed to love to brag in the movie about how their footage was the first time it was seen. Yeah right!Definitely worth the $9 I paid for this movie."
2,Made in Japan?,"Based on the Product Description ""It was assumed no color films existed in Japan..."" you might think this was all Japanese film. You would be wrong. Very little was shot by the Japanese. I was disapointed."
1,The director ruined the archived video,"All old film was shot in 4:3 aspect ratio. However, the director chopped off the top and bottom of the video to wedge it into 16:9 format. Thus, a noticeable chunk of the information has been thrown away in their drive to look ""modern""."
3,looking for sympathy,"There are some interesting segments in this video, I happen to like to here both sides of history. Missing most of 1943-44, looks at Americans as the aggressor when talking about bombing campaign. No discussion of any length about japanese atrocities. interesting, but misses a lot, can see most of the videos on the history or military channel"
3,Japans war in colour,"A bit shellow in content no depth, nothing new, doesn,t go into why Japan was forced into the pacific war or what effect the wars with USSR had on these decisions."
5,Produo histórica,"O DVD tem ótima produo para a mídia - DVD, agora que estamos to acostumados com as cenas em blu-ray, a filmages ""clássicas"", do comeo do Século XX so emocionantes de se ver."
3,MEDIOCRE AT BEST,"I WAS ANTICIPATING WATCHING THIS DVD AS A MILITARY HISTORY BUFF AND A FAN OF THE NARRATOR BRIAN COX.MR.COX DIDN'T DISAPPOINT ME BUT THE FILM DID.DON'T EXPECT TO SEE A WHOLE LOT OF COLOR FOOTAGE FROM HOME FRONT JAPAN BEFORE AND DURING THE WAR.THERE IS SOME BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE COLOR FOOTAGE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN GLEANED FROM OTHER SOURCES AND REHASHED TO THIS FILM.I HAVE SEEN MUCH OF THIS FOOTAGE IN OTHER FILMS. A LOT OF IT IS AMERICAN,BRITISH AND GERMAN.IT WAS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT."
3,Excellent but...,"Certainly a different perspective on the war in the Pacific/Asia. It presented facts I did not know or at least ignored before. It is very limited in its range because of the requirement of colour I suspect. I have seen much of this colour footage before, however much was new to me as well.The most irritating feature was the the continuous 'musical' drone behind the dialogue. It is fairly common in documentaries these days but annoying and distracting nonetheless. The added feature of the early post war film 'The Last Bomb' was very welcomed as it outlined the planning for the large air raids on Japan. Now that was enlightening despite the period martial music behind it. That music seemed in keeping because of its age but the elevator music in the main feature very nearly made me switch it off - perhaps I am too sensitive about it but I see no point in just putting in noise for no reason."
3,it was okay!,"not very fond of the suit, but dont hate it either. My baby in the water with me basically holding him anyways. Just wasnt enough for my BIG HEAVY boys. for normal size kids sure probably perfect, but my kids born much larger, stayed continually larger than. SO FOR ME AND MINE , ehh!"
1,the shoe doesnt fit,the size does fit the boy he sank you need to retest your prodouct i wasted time and money on this product i seen it work good for little kids thats why i got it but the larger size did not keep my son up he uses a live vest that works very very well
1,This Book is Awful!!!,"If you are really interested in doing what you want to do and realizing your dreams--there are better things to read than this trash. For women, I would recommend anything by Faith Popcorn orCarol Hyatt, both are much better writers and convey more meaningful information."
3,Not my favorite translation,"Actually, this edition doesn't include Genesis, or anything else from the Old Testament (other than Psalms and Proverbs).My problem with it (the translation, not the lack of OT, obviously) is that it feels a little dumbed down. Sometimes it doesn't even get the correct meaning across. It was a valiant effort, though... Try the New Internation Version, Today's English Version, New Jerusalem Bible (my favorite), etc."
2,Rewriting the Bible isn't good for my daughter,"I had a big hang-up on the fact that the writer tried to re-write the Bible. The verses that she quoted through out the book weren't inspired by God. If God had intended for daughters to be the subject of the verses, He would have had the daughters included. There are reasons why daughters aren't used in comparison in the Bible to their mothers. There are just too many other good daughter-training books out there that my girls can read instead."
4,Refreshing,"I've loved this product for years but have found it difficult to find, so Amazon saved the day. It's such a pleasant color and has a mild fragrance. Glycerine soaps just seem cleaner somehow."
3,Not all that happy with this soap,"Mild and rinses clean, but the smell is way too strong and synthetic. The original Pears soap in amber smells much better."
1,MY MISTAKE,"Did I buy this? Can somebody tell me why? Must have been a slow day. But, that's what you get when you can't think of anything else to buy."
3,OK,Im not trying to diss but this album is not that good but it gets 3 stars from me because of the song Jamboree but I do like Naughty
4,YOU DOWN WIT' NBN,"NAUGHTY BY NATURE ARE THE MASTERS OF ANTHEMS. TRACKS LIKE ""WICKED BOUNCE"" AND ""ON THE RUN"" SERVE AS PRIME EXAMPLES WITH THEIR INFECTIOUS HOOKS. I GOTTA SHOW LOVE TO NAUGHTY FOR SHOWING LOVE FOR THEM 504 BOYZ FROM NO LIMIT TOO. TAKE ONE LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM AND TELL ME IF TREACH AIN'T ONE OF THE MOST VICIOUS EMCEES IN THIS GAME OR NOT . IT'S DEFINITELY 19 NAUGHTY 9. PREPARE FOR THE STORM!"
5,You gotta get this cd!,"i highly reccomend buying this cd, there are so many good songs on this cd. and ""live or die"" with mystikal and silkk the shocker is tight. go get it"
2,NOT A GOOD CD,"NAUGHTY BY NATURE MUSIC IS NOT GOOD FOR ME RIGHT NOW,THE BEAT MUSIC THEY USE IS BORING.I USE TO BE A BIG FAN OF NAUGHTY BY NATURE SINCE 91 TO 95.I NEVER LISTEN TO THIS CD THAT MUCH SINCE I GOT IT, IF THEY DOING ANOTHER FORTH ALBUM I'M NOT PLANNING TO BUY IT."
4,Not As Good As The Others,"This Latest Naughty Album has the rymes and beats to make it a decent rap Album. Guest appearances by Silk The Shocker,Mystikal, Big pun and krazie bone make the album interesting. However, this album does not quite meet the sounds of there first three albums Naughty could have done alittle better. The Album is just fine for non-naughty fans. It will not be a dissapointment for diehard naughty fans"
4,DEFINETLY A KEEPER!!!,"I picked up this cd mainly because I'm a naughty fan. And while I thoufgt the collaboration of other artists was interesting, it's not enough classic naughty by nature!! I still have to go with poverty's paradise and the first self titled cd as my all time favorities so far. I'm still looking forward to hearing more ""classic naughty"""
4,Why are Naughty being slept on,Naughty did their thing here. Vinny rapped a little more here than ususal. The one with Pun is hot. This is a quality album that is being slept on way too much.
2,Not the best Naughty by Nature has to offer.,This album lacked what songs on former Naughty albums had-songs that keep you hooked and there famous style of beats. The lyrics are not that bad but Treach does'nt really seem to bring the emotion he usually does into his songs.
3,Treach remains on point....,"I've been a Naughty fan since they've smashed into the hip-hop scene in '91. They've not only pushed the envelope but added a new dimention to hip-hop; with fresh hard-hitting lyics and lyrical dexterity of front man, Treach, a follwing was instantly created. Eight years and three cds later, they appear to be unwilling to forgoe the formula that's worked for them in the past. Treach reamains on point (like usual for most of the cd), but in trying to maintain the appeal of a larger and diverse hip-hop arena, the mesh of pop, Southern, ""Westcoast"", and collabos prevent us from seeing ""Naughty"" do what they do best--be ""Naughty"". I guess however, that's what we scacrifice when record execs not only want records sold, but are calling for hits. I still reccommend this cd. Tracks like ""Radio"" and ""Ring the Alarm"" are straight up bangin'; hitting you the same way other Naughty classics hit you. They just need to try less at gaining the appeal of every Black musical genre."
1,Skullcandy Bluetooth Link...NOT!!!,"Bluetooth is a wireless technology to get music to headphones, speeakers, etc.. This is not""Bluetooth Technology"" but a coupler from a music device or phone to headphones -HARDWIRED! The phone will break into the garbled sounding music via Bluetooth, but again the music must be connected with a wire ""through"" the Bluetooth adapter. Worthless!"
5,Better Than I'd Hoped For,This book arrived in beautiful condition and was even more clever than the newer version I have. I would definitely order from this vendor again.
4,Good despite bad dubbing!,This is the original Swedish version of Pippi Longstocking it is pretty good despite the bad dubbing but despite that the movie is very charming and appealing and so are all the other movies in the delightful series that stars Inger Nilsson as Pippi and she is the defintive Pippi! It's a shame that this classic is out of stock it's better than the 80's remake. Fans of Astrid Lindgren's Pippi books will find this Swedish version more faithful to the books than the remake.
3,The Immortal Maysa,"A collection of Jobin's Brazilian songs on an Argentinean record production, but it is really the first song, Eu sei que vou te amar, that's worth the whole disc. Every once in awhile a writer, artist or composer creates a jewel, when everything worthwhile comes together and the total is a masterpiece, worth far more than the sum of its parts. The melody, the lyric, and Maysa's incomparable voice transcend a song about love lasting a lifetime and become love itself."
3,Not this exact item.,"This is not a review for these exact dressing gowns, but a rant about dressing gowns in general.With the birth of my daughter, my mother bought me many dressing gowns. She knows that in life I really love simplicity, and she had loved the ease of diaper changes with these one piece outfits when she had kids.In theory, what could be better than not having to remove clothing or undo snaps to change the baby? Unfortunately, they perpetually rode up, exposing my daughters legs. With these on, she was essentially wearing a bunched up T-shirt at all times. You couldn't buckle her into anything with gowns on, because there was no gap between her little legs.If I find dressing gowns that maybe velcro at the bottom and make an easy to undo sack, I would purchase them by the dozen. Provided they had a slot for belts to go through and were made of an outdoors kind of material... Otherwise, I do not really reccommend them."
4,Historically fascinating description of early Florida,"The murder of Guy Bradley, and the subsequent failure of justice is an interesting, but in the end secondary part of this book. The strength of this narrative is the wonderful descriptions of the courageous, or perhaps desperate, settlers in a strange and extremely hostile area of South Florida. The story of the Plume hunters is an interesting historic tale, and their actions affect the South Florida and Everglades environment right up to this day.This is a worthwhile read if you have an interest in South Florida history, or care about the type of people drawn to such a hostile environment so many years ago."
5,"If you lift, then this book is for you!","No matter if you are a novice or an expert on body building, this book will undoubtedly come in handy. Everything you need to know about getting built is in here - from excercises to techniques to supplements - you name it. If you are starting out, then reading this book will enlighten you on how to build and make you seem like less of an idiot at the gym. If you already lift, this book will further your knowledge and give you an edge that will maybe one day allow you to compete with the biggest and the best in the business. It's the next best thing to having your own personal trainer."
4,A Good Bodybuilding Training Manual with Lots of Exercises.,"This book has a nice collection of exercises, with photographs and detailed description on the proper execution techniques for each one of them. The detailed description on each exercise include: The muscles emphasized by the exercise, its starting position, movement performance, exercise variations and training tips.One valuable aspect of this training book is that at the end of each chapter you will find a lot of routines from Professional bodybuilders and champs. Each muscle is treated with great detail in its own individual book chapter.In summary, very useful manual, with lots of exercises and routines, and plenty of information on nutrition, aerobics, training techniques and principles as they apply to bodybuilding."
2,Good for a beginner,"There's not much to be learned here unless you've never stepped foot in a gym or are a relative beginner. Some of the exercises are shown improperly(e.g. the one-arm dumbell row shows the girl lifting her elbow above her torso at the contracted position - a great way to experience rotator cuff surgery and elbow tendinitis - not uppper back development).I would say that I learned something from this book, but the fact is I didn't."
1,CHEAP !!!!,"There's cheap ripoffs and then there's baby genius.I wasn't expecting it to be anything comparable to thebaby Einstein series but this is atrocious.The images have are low quality, and unattractive.The video entirely lacks imagination, creativity and any sort of quality whatsoever.You would think making a baby Einstein ripoff would be easy right? Get some colorful toys, take some colorful animation and throw it together to classical music.This video can't even achieve that. It held my kids attention for about 1 minute. They now cry when it come one.HORRIBLE!!!Note: I have 4 videos in this series. They are all a waste of money. Who makes this garbage???!!!"
4,Great DVD for the price...,"Our 1 year old really likes this DVD. The musical selections are great and we even enjoy watching it each night as we all get ready for beddy-bye time. The only complaint I have is the annoying animated characters that pop up from time to time, especially the tiger in the UFO and the little boy driving the car across the screen then blows the horn when your little one is just about asleep??? Who thought that was a good idea? All in all it's a good DVD for the price. I would advise purchase."
3,Does not meet the same expectations as some of the other's,"While it is a Baby Genius CD it in no way compares with Favorite Nursery Rhymes and Favorite Children Songs which is the best, after getting all the Baby Genius CD's I would save my money on this one as it is not able to really keep their attention for very long, not much in the way of children interaction like some of the other's, maybe ok for younger children, our grand daughter was 18 months when she got it and she watched it the first time and didn't make it through the entire CD before she was bored with it."
4,good,works well.very relaxing for my 7months old.comparable to thebaby einstein movies.good to add to your baby dvd collection.
1,a disappointment,"I bought the Spanish version of this DVD and there was NO POINT AT ALL. If there is no speaking on the video, why advertise it as the Spanish version? RIDICULOUS. Buy it only if you are aware - this is music and cheap (and random!) animations."
2,Not what I expected,"There's footage of kids playing on this dvd, not what I was expecting on a ""sleeptime"" DVD"
2,One of the poorer volumes.,"The book has some good action, but overall it's poorly written. It has some small plot holes, illogical action by Fank & Joe, and some big coincidences. I have read every Hardy Boy book more than once, and I'd have to put this one near the bottom. I gave it two stars becuase there is some good atmosphere, and the outline and concept are pretty good, but some of the story is just too unrealistic, illogical, and coincidental. 2 Stars."
3,Not Bad,"I think this was a very good book, but not one of the best in the series. I would still reccomend reading it."
4,A very informative book,This book is very unusual and awakening the moslem world but unfortunately that world will be defiant to the facts exposed!
1,Horrible... Don't saste your time!,"unscholarly, out of context,and full of lies! worst book ever! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!I advise people to read books with at least some scholarly merit...this book has NONE! Ibn Warraq is a HATEMONGER!"
2,The opening sentence of the book...,"""""The stereotypic image of the Muslim holy warrior with a sword in one hand and the Koran in the other would only be plausible if he was left handed, since no devout Muslim should or would touch a Koran with his left hand which is reserved for dirty chores."" - no longer holds in the modern world.e.g., I have two news photographs here:[...]With what certainty can we say that it held in the ancient world?"
2,Typical Western perspective?,"Capita selacta from western scholarship on Islam, saving the a wider audience to dig their way through university libraries. Most of the material is soon going to be overtaken by the latest developments based on comparisons of the oldest manuscripts with contemporary Syro-aramaic (the method proposed by Christoph Luxenberg)In a novel contribution, the publishers of this book on such a delicate topic underscore the desperate need for intelligent dialogue with Islam by allowing the beautiful image of a Qur'an on the dustjacket to be printed --- UPSIDE DOWN. ..."
1,"Nice try, to no avail","The worst part about this book is, it is not based on the author's research using the open mind to analyze the situation. It's basically the orientalis' thinking! Have a look at this page www.afi.org.uk/New%20Articles/1Book%20Review.htmlAny body can claim an Arabic name and write books like this one. (Who is this Ibn Warraq anyway!) But the unobjectivity of this book is obvius from the very beginning. I wish the author at least try to discuss the rather heavy issues in this bookbefore he (or she) wrote his, or perhaps the orientalis', opinion. But he couldn't explain the science side on the Koran. Please read the book by Maurice Bucaille.Again, you can judge this book by yourself. But believe me, there are only arroganism, anger, etc. (judge it)."
2,not scholarly,"This book is just a mere collection of journal articles written by missionaries (and Noldeke). the only original feature of his book is his introduction, and to tell you the truth, I didn't even bother reading his introduction because of his hiostility towards Islam. Any one can write a book like that: go to a good library and start collecting articles on a chosen subject."
1,wow,"I haven't read this book ... but just by looking at the cover you can see the disrespect. He shows no decency, a piece of Qur'anic manuscript is portrayed upside down!! I highly dislike this creature and I piss on it's so called ""scholarship."""
4,Some important articles but the collection is rather dated.,"This is a useful collection of articles on the historical origins of the Qur'an, many of which are hard, for the non-specialist, to track down. The very small number of similar publications available on the market makes this an important book. However, the material included is rather old, to say the least, with virtually nothing from the last fifty years of scholarship, when important advances have been made. It is a shame, for example, that we are not given any ""classic"" introductions dealing with some recent discoveries, such as the early variant forms of the Qur'an found in the 70s in Yemen. It is also rather sad that, given the enormous number of critical (in the best sense of the word) studies of Christian and Jewish religious texts, that the articles included here do not make use of the plethora of historical tools that these, comparable works, have made available to the modern scholar."
5,Honor Book,"FREAKs won ""Honorable Mention"" in the Writer's Digest 2001 Book Writing Competition...""In a few pages Scalia takes the readers into a realistic junior high environment that could be theirs. The story could be theirs, too... Hildy, Scotty, Harrison, Carmine are so real! Scalia treats them with the respect each deserves. The voice of the story and Hildy's voice are loud and clear. The language is simple but beautiful. The dialogue is credible... Young adults of different reading levels will enjoy this book. Adults should read it, too."""
4,Travelog of Ancient Egypt's modern discovery,"This book is not really about Ancient Egypt. It is, as its title suggests, a book about the discovery of Egypt by modern Europeans and research on the civilization through the 1980s. In a lot of ways it reminds me of a National Geographic issue which isn't bad it just isn't highly technical or academic but geared toward a general audience. If it is judged with this audience in mind, it rates as an excellent book. For anyone more serious, it may be amusing and interesting and certainly a nice change in that it attempts to discuss fairly recent research."
4,Hormone Book by my doctor,"This book was purchased when I visited Dr. McWherter recently. It was written mainly for his patients to explain the myriad of things that usually go right over the top of their heads. Though much of it is too deep for me, it does explain how to determine hormone levels by symptoms, and gives much important, practical information in many various areas (including exercise, stress reduction, and nutrition) which will help us to avoid not only breast cancer, but most of the diseases of aging. Lots of questionaires and lists in the appendix and specific ways to detoxify our bodies."
3,I am the author,"Hello All,I write this in response to the reader from Birmingham, England, who was kind enough to (a) buy my book and (b) comment upon it. It is not a work of fiction. It is fact. I researched everything I wrote. I am sorry the reader missed my point about Pope Joan. As explained in my book, for centuries the Church believed she had existed. It was only later that historians concluded that she had not. The most important facet about Joan is that people believed she was elected as the best available candidate. The legend never ""hinted that she had governed unwisely, or had been a bad pope. Her downfall resulted merely from her becoming an unwed mother.""Again, I thank the reader. I wrote the book for kicks. I love history and I love humor. I will be the first to admit that it is not a masterpiece. It is not J.R.R. Tolkien or Dave Barry, my literary heroes. That is why I rated it a ""3"" (most humbly).Slainte,Mike Wall"
5,An excellent brief overview of Aztec civilization,"This is an admirable example of how to introduce non-experts to an ancient culture without being pedantic or boring. In one hundred and fifty pages, Boone gives us a very readable summary of Aztec history, culture, religion, economics, and politics. While she describes the horrors of human sacrifice, she also lets us see the more positive sides of Aztec life, including the glory of Tenochtitlan. She helps us to understand how a small number of Spaniards brought down the empire. The book is well illustrated in color."
5,Perfect introduction to financial statements for humans,"This book provides an excellent and easily grasped introduction to financial statements. Then it goes on to explain how to make sense of the figures.I recently read for the second time, I cannot recommend this book more highly."
5,Just great,What a great reading! Another example that it is possible to write clear and simple evan about comlex questions. A must read book. Congratulation!!!
3,"Great pictures, fine story, terrible writing","I don't mind the truncation of the story. I don't think Aslan appears weak. But the writing is technically very poor. It is absolute ellipsis *hell*. Check out this unmodified passage from the first/second page (it has a nasty habit of splitting sentences across page turns):""And of course, right here on this side of the wardrobe, were four children ... Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy ... all of them longing for adventure. Lucy, the youngest, and most longing, was first to push past the furry coats ... [turn page] ... and find herself in a snowy wood, under a streetlamp ... where the Witch's wickedness had made it always winter.""It's just awful reading this to my daughter. I am tempted to make up my own version."
5,Captivating,"My three year old daughter is captivated by this intriguing and beautifully illustrated rendition of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. This book has sparked her imagination beyond words! She talks about the ""white witch"" during the day, and the poor Mr. Tumnus turned to stone, and is enchanted by every page of this book. We read it every night, every single word. I do not find the text broken up and difficult to follow. The pauses that occur from one page to another allow discussion of the book and create eager anticipation! It has also sparked conversation about God. I really can't say enough good things and encourage all readers to delight in this fantastic fantasy."
5,Wonderful retelling of the story for younger kids,"My almost 6 year old really wanted to watch the movie but is prone to night mares so we said no. She was very interested in the story that she heard from friends and wanted to say she knew it too. We found this book and are both thrilled. It's a wonderful retelling of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. It takes less than 10 minutes to read out loud and the illustrations are fantastic, very beautiful. It's very true to the actual story, just shorter and ideal for younger kids. I'd say 4-7 old range. We highly recommend this book for the younger kids interested in Narnia but not yet ready for the longer chapter book or movie."
4,Our grandson loved it,"As soon as he got this book, he sat right down and began to read it. He's 7, and reading is a challenge for him,so it's good to know that it drew him in."
2,"NOT the actual C.S. Lewis story, Great Pictures though.","While the illustrations in this Book are great, the text is not the actual text of C.S. Lewis. The book is written ""BASED ON"" the Narnia. Well, the story here is a little twisted which makes a huge difference in the understanding of the main thrust of the narration. Aslan is depicted weak and impotent and redemption story is not evident from the text. Otherwise, if you know the true story, the pictures are worth the money. (You may have to use quite a bit of whiteout on this one.)"
2,Soulmotor - self-titled (CMC International),"Apparently,this is the band that former Tesla bassist Brian Wheat is/was in.This was the group's first of two(so far)releases.It's okay,for music to play in the background while you're doing something else.Also believe that Tesla guitarist,Frank Hannon was involved in the making of this record.Best described as bluesy-like '70's music,inspired rock&roll.Actually,it COULD grow on you.Tunes I sort of liked were ""Guardian Angel"",""Lizard Boots"",""Go For A Ride"" and ""Supermodel"".Give it a try.You might like it more than I did."
3,havent heard it all yet,"i am going to buy this cd on the grounds that it has brian wheat, formerly of tesla, no one has noticed that yet....this album will kick **, i know it...i saw tesla in a small club here in houston, and while i hope and pray that they get back together, i know that bw is intense in his music....guardian angel is one of the baddest ass songs to drive to that i know of...Brian, if you read this, i would love an e-mail...you kick ***!!!"
1,Looks good but didn't help me one bit,"I have arthritis in my knees and ankles.I purchased both the neckless and a bracelet.I know everything doen't work for everyone and this didn't help me at all.The item arrived on time and was in good condition, they just didn't do anything at all for me."
4,Nice piece.,"I could have made it myself with the kids kit sold by Oriental Trading for about the price I paid but, then again, this was already made. The benefits of bio-magnetic therapy still yet to be seen."
5,great album. worth my money.,"the album is great. hes a dope mc. beats are cool. Really, i give this a 4.5 because the sound quality is kind of low and theres quite a few tracks. but it was worth my time."
4,Every man needs an evolution,"First and foremost, One Be Lo is a hell of a lyricist. He has always kicked ass, solo or with Binary Star. He can paint a picture with his words unlike any other mc I've heard in quite some time. So, lyrically, this CD is top notch. There would be no way for me to pick a favorite vocal track, because each one is dead-on.As far as the beats go, this albums on and off. Some of the tracks are perfect, but some of them miss the mark a little bit. ""Axis"", ""Sleepwalking"", ""Rocketship"", ""Enec Eht No KcaB"" are my personal favorite beats. But most of the other tracks are just a little bit above average.This is a CD that's meant to be paid attention to. If you sit down and listen to what he's saying, it's truly profound. But, as a background CD, it's probably not going to hit the spot."
5,a few words for the two people who gave one star...,"...i just dont get it. how delicate weve become, hey?"
4,QUALITY- 4.5 stars,"The first time I heard this album i crapped myself. The beats are consistently fresh and the lyrics are insightful and thought-provoking (sometimes). I really can't say enough about the beats. The synthesizer line in ""E.T."" is one of the coolest melodies i've ever heard on a track. I think One achieved exactly what he was going for with S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M., but He just did it a little too much. As a whole, this album is better than anything Binary Star ever made, including Masters of the Universe, which is pretty solid. One's style and lyrics are perfect because they're hardcore without being violent and conscious without being emo or preachy. Its just good, energetic hip hop. I think this album is just too good for too long- making me wonder what all these other fabricated MCs are doing with their 13 track cds where half of the tracks are skits."
1,great album marred by antisemitic comment,Would be 5 stars but for his rhyming about the Jews controlling the media on the track propaganda.
1,Could do without the anti-semitism,"There's nothing worse than popping in a CD, listening several times and enjoying it more, then hearing a racist lyric. I played the track twice more to confirm what I heard, Jews control what I say."
4,Bon Voyage,"Considero que su mayor éxito fueron sus interpretaciones en francés y este álbum trae varias de sus mejores canciones, gracias por permitirnos volver a escucharla."
2,unreliable seller!!,"The cap is of good quality, but the seller is terrible. The item arrived 3 weeks after I ordered it...10 days later than when I needed it. I tried to contact the seller several times by e-mail and by phone, but never received an answer."
2,"Cute, but only tangentially about teaching","I received this book as a gift before I became a teaching assistant. Reading it at the end of my teaching stint, I find that there is not much substance to the style. It is a collection of quotes, which I generally don't enjoy, with each chapter being quotes on a particular theme. This works at first, various instructors or famous people reflecting on their tutelage. But maybe 25 pages in it begins to dissolve into just seemingly-random quotes on life. You could open the page at random, pick a quote and instantly apply it to teaching...or metallurgy. I finished the book and had found only two quotes to be meaningful, neither in relation to actual teaching but more as life affirmations.In short, if you need a gift for your child's teacher feel free to get this in hopes that they'll never do more than occasionally flip to a page in boredom."
1,Disjointed,"Are there a few cute boys in this movie? Yes. Does that make it worth it? No. Stupid acting and a script, if you can call it that, which left me dumbfounded as to what the movie was about. In the end, more crass than corny. Not worth it."
4,History of the Sacraments,"Joe Martos' book is quite detailed on the history of theSacraments. The first part of the book is about sacramentsin general: sacraemtns in all religions, beginnings of the Christian Sacraments, Development of the Catholic Sacraments.He writes about the Protestant relationship to theSacraments and the problems that Martin Luther had withhow Catholics were doing Sacraments.In the second part of the book he goes into detail on eachof the seven Catholic Sacraments.The book is so detailed and philisophical at times it makesit difficult to stay focused on the reading.This book is used in many college courses on Sacraments. Itis NOT a light read, nor does it give much on the rites oftoday's sacraments. It is a historical perspective."
1,Careful...,This book reads more like an argument than a history book. The author clearly intends to deconstruct current church practice by putting forth an extremely negative view of the historical development of the sacraments.
3,religious,i find this a good starting point for teaching the youngsters in our religious ed program as well as when trying to help older people who may have questions.
1,two different books,"This book offers up a non-detailed summary of weapons systems that are being contemplated and tested for the next round of wars. Most of it is obvious from reading Popular Mechanics. The author attempts to write up possible scenarios as to how such weapons might be used in an imagined confrontation in the near future. Sadly he also comments on political and ethical considerations in the last part of the book that that sound like the ravings of a lunatic. ( For example: In an effort to stem the tide of murders in the Middle East the author recommends that we do as the Russians and target the families of suicide bombers, hack up their bodies and send the parts to their relatives. Apparently it worked. If you like hearing this sort of thing as a serious policy proposal coming from a high ranking American military officer then you might like the book.) It makes you wonder what a lifetime of service in the military actually does to your mind."
1,I really wanted to like this,"I read the graphic novel version first and I definitely recommend you get hold of the graphic novel. It's awesome. I'd give it 5 out of 5 stars.I really had high hopes for this film. I think it COULD have been a great film but unfortunately the acting's terrible, especially Ted Raimi, he just irritates the hell out of me everytime he's on the screen. The actors' Eastern European accents are extremely iffy and the film just DRAGS. I actually ended up falling asleep after 70 minutes.I think this could have been a great film if it had a bigger budget and better actors so I recommend you get hold of the excellent graphic novel instead."
3,SoSo,"This wasn't one of the best films Bruce has made, but there were some pretty funny scenes. As always you can't go wrong when Bruce is involved. It's worth adding to your collection."
1,Bruce Campbell In A Bad Film????,Yes its true this was a terrible movie. Filmed badly and the acting was terrible even for Bruce Campbells standard. I have been a huge fan of Campbells work for years but this movie was just plain bad.Sorry Bruce I had to say it.Two thumbs down.
2,Fell Short,I'm a big fan of bruce campbell but this movie really fell short. It wasn't funny at all.
1,"Not a Campbell Classic, This movie is really lousy.","D0 not, I repeat DO NOT purchase this movie. As A die-hard Bruce fan, loving all of Bruce's work, (ie Brisco County, evil Dead, Army Darkness and Bubba Ho-tep) I bought this movie. I read these reviews on Amazon here, and thought It may possibly be good. DO NOT BELIVE THE OTHER REVIEWS. I was sceptical about this movie at first, and decided to rent it, but none of the rental stores had it so I bought it. This movie is the bottom of the barrel. There is nothing to like in this flick at all. As much as I tried to like it, I was extremely pi**ed off and bored. All of the characters suck, and I hated all of them. The plot is extremely stupid. None of the actors seem to enjoy doing this movie and the comedy is just lame. Bruce's character is the worst of them all.Do not even watch this if you enjoy Bruce movies. It will leave you resenting him for making it."
1,MAN WITH THE SCREAMING BRAIN DVD REVIEW,"I'm not a big fan of Bruce Campell but I was appalled while viewing this film. I know it's a B Horror film but there was no orginality in this movie. I know it's suppose to be funny but come on people, was it really? The only part that was slightly funny was when Campell's wife was going after the Gypsy for the first time.Needless to say, I think it's interesting that this movie was a book.Going off subject, however, on a late night talk show Bruce acknowledged that there was no such thing as a PG-13 horror film. I'll conform with that."
3,"A nice effort, but . . .","Not a terrible film by any means, but still misses as much as it hits. The idea is fine and the acting, while a little broad, works well enough. But the story is too messy, and it drags in spots.And of course, there's the humor. It's okay, sometimes it even made me chuckle. But overall it reminded me of Bruce Campbell's novel ""Make Love the Bruce Campbell Way"". Obvious, clumsy, and more likely to bring a groan than a laugh.WOULD I EVER WATCH THE FILM AGAIN? No.WOULD I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO WASN'T A DIEHARD BRUCE CAMPBELL FAN? No.WAS I BORED BY IT OFTEN ENOUGH TO NOTICE? Yes.THREE STRIKES. In the end, I give it an okay, worth seeing once, but ultimately unexceptional."
1,"not very ""screaming"" at all","Bruce Campbell, superstar? Not with movies like this. OK, so he's a cult figure and all, but there's nothing particularly redeeming at all about this movie and Ted Raimi is much more interesting. An American diplomat (played by Campbell) is accidentally killed and dragged back to the lair of a mad scientist who transplants the brain of a taxi driver into him and voila, that's about it, and of course stupid behavior ensues. I bought this with the highest expectations, and after I watched it only loaned it to a friend who watched it and also thought it was pretty lame, and then traded it in. As I mentioned Ted Raimi pretty much steals the show, as the Russian assistant of the mad scientist (as played by Stacy Keach, who must be hard up for money) and Raimi is the best thing this has going as he does his Russian hip-hop patter. Other than that, this is a bust, bleah."
4,a fun funky show,"""the man with the screaming brain"" should suck beyond belief.after watching it for the first time,I thought about what I had just seen,and became very confused.it starts off like a pretty basic drama,and by the time wiiliam(bruce)cole encounters a hotel maid all hell breaks loose.you get a bar room brawl,brain surgery,a ridiculous head wound,ted raimi singing,a dancing robot,a cat fight,bruce riding a pink moped,stacy keach as a mad scientist.its goofy as hell in some spots,but damn it works.The bonus features are pretty good,the best one is priceless,a brief history of the hell they went through to get screaming brain made called:neurology 101,this alone is worth buying the dvd."
3,Well-written but frustrating,"As someone who loved the original Earthsea trilogy and some of Le Guin's other books, this one was frustrating to me. The writing was typically beautiful but the story seemed to move so slowly. The theme is interesting and reminded me a lot of Phillip Pullman's ""The Amber Spyglass"" with its view of the place where half-dead souls are stuck... But I probably wouldn't have finished this book if I'd had something better to read. I'm surprised by how many people gave it 5 stars - but I guess that just proves that people's taste differs."
2,"Should be titled ""Men do Everything Wrong""","This book should have been titled ""Men do Everything Wrong"", in two senses: First, in every story the men can't do anything right. Secondly, everything that's wrong with Earthsea is the fault of Men. In this way, LeGuin begs forgivness for the sin of not being sufficiently Feminist in the first three books.If you loved the Earthsea trilogy, you'll be outraged by what LeGuin does to it in this book, and in Tehanu. As best I can sum it up, her attitude is ""I spit on your memory."""
3,The master doesn't know where to start,"I'll be straight with you, I did not finish this book. Why didn't I finish it? Because LeGuin burried me in backstory. There is a rule that every writer should know, ""if that is the story you want to tell, tell it, don't refer back to it."" Now I understand that this is just a follow up to her original trilogy, but she puts in so much narrative filled with explanations of the past that you begin to wonder what happened to the current story.LeGuin is an amazing storyteller, and her ideas seemed to have a lot going for them. Her descriptions were vivid, and the storyline was good. Even the characters were intriguing, but like I said, she starts and stops the story so often that you eventually get tired of it and toss in the towel.As a stand alone novel, I'd give it a thumbs down. Maybe I'll go back and read the trilogy and then be pulled through this novel, but somehow I'm doubting that."
4,about time!,"Thank god - le Guin has rescued Earthsea from what was once described as the most depressing afterlife in fantasy literature! Probably not the best in the series, but wonderful none the less."
3,"A good beginning, but predictable ending.","I love the entire series, and was so surpised to see this addition. Le Guin spends a lot of time building the context of the story plot only to leave the ending a predicatble, almost boring ending. It's worth reading, but I'd wait for paperback."
2,Disappointed,"I loved the EarthSea trilogy, but I was very disappointed with this book. I'm not sure why the reviews are so good. What existed of the story line, dragged terribly. The character development was poor and they failed to captivate me the way the original characters did. The ending was predictable and we seemed to be going over the same old ground."
4,Adult novel is finale to kids series,"Yes, you kind of have to have read the previous books to get the deeper meanings of the plot and character development. Yes, it is not the simplistic (as if anything by leguin could be called simplistic) plot of the first few Earthsea books. Unlike those first books: aimed at children, this book is aimed at the adult who can tolerate a more complex world, more complex characters, and a few suprises along the way. Less action, more food for thought.She undoes some of the pat solutions left earlier in the series, makes heroes into human beings, and does all those things I hated in a book in my teens but appreciate now: portrays life as messy and complex and makes you question everything: But in a deepening way, not a disturbing way.Fans of LeGuin (Left Hand of Darkness, The Telling...) will not be disappointed."
3,Not my cup of tea,"While I really loved the original Earthsea trilogy, both as a kid and as an adult, this book (and ""Tehanu"") were a bit disappointing. I had a hard time deciding on whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars and in the end went with 3. I can't pick out anything technically wrong with the book, but it failed to draw me in. Despite being relatively short, it took me months to finish this book. Nothing much was really happening, so I didn't feel at all compelled to see what happened (or rather, didn't happen) next.This novel didn't have a plot so much as a theme, and LeGuin used some familiar and some new characters to explore that theme. If that's the kind of book you like, then you'll probably love ""The Other Wind"". However, I read fiction (and fantasy in particular) for engaging and thrilling stories. That type of story was lacking here.I still think LeGuin is very talented, but as she has matured as a writer she now seems to prefer writing a type of book that I do not prefer to read."
5,Deep and Profound!,"It's been a few years since I read all the books in the Wizard of Earthsea series to my son, but I remember the depth of the characters as though yesterday. Deep, heavy stuff that leaves you enriched and changed for having read it.These books are labeled 'young adult' but deep and profound enough to be appreciated by adults.Another reviewer compared them to The Lord of the Rings. I disagree. While Tolkien deserved all the credit he got for being the first to create a lush, intricate universe and bring it to life, it is ultimately an action story. Le Guin's ability to develop strong, complex characters far surpasses any mere action story. Her characters and their experiences reach deep into your soul and do not let go."
3,"When it's good, it's very very good; when it's bad...","...it hurts. The good: ""Ramon's Blues"" and ""Green Onions"", both of which the guitar solos alternate between Buchanan and Steve Cropper as well as the cute ""Adventures of Brer Rabbit and Tar Baby"", ""Done Your Daddy Dirty"" which has a good guitar riff, and the powerful leadoff track ""The Heat of the Battle"". OK: ""Hidden"" which has strings and flutes as well as an acoustic piano; ""The Circle"" which (thankfully) is a rare vocal; the singing is marginal. Bad: ""Judy"", a would-be mellow New-Age piece that doesn't really mesh well with the frenetic guitar. Really Bad: ""Your Love""; a ballad and misplaced to say the least. One of the worst tracks I have on CD. Can't imagine what he was thinking on that one. At least it's the last track on the CD, so whan that comes on you know it's time to change disks. This CD is probably better for Buchanan fans; others start somewhere else."
3,Great place - bad pictures!!!,"Dazu is a really great place. It is as stunning as Yungang caves in Shanxi and much more impressive than the famous Mogao caves in the Gansu province. And this makes probably just about every book on the place worthwhile. BUT half of the photographs in this book are so bad it is unbelievable. True, those caves tend to be dark and there is little room for you to step back when taking a picture etc... but one would assume that somebody who wants to publish a book about the place could do better than take average tourist-quality (and sometimes worse) pictures. Unfortunately, this seems to be the only book on the topic out there. So there is really no choice for you if you are interested in Dazu. The accompanying text is very detailed and seems very good but, let's face it, most of us don't get books of this type primarily because of the text - it is the photographs that really matter. In sum, think twice before you get this book."
5,A shining example,Clyde Drexler was always my favorite player not only for his on the court play but for his off the court demeanor. He was always friendly and a perfect gentlemen. This book just reenforces those attributes and shows a man who is content and proud of his career.
5,This dual mic holder works perfectly,Using this with a pair of Rode NY5 condenser mics. Great little gadget! Could also use for using two vocal mics.
4,Nice,Works for what I need it and the base can be adjusted to different angles which is good but would have preferred it fixed. Overall very good product and quality.
2,pretty average coffee.,"Not great coffee. Rocamojo and PuraVida, which amazon also sells is so much better--and those aren't great just good. This is cheap coffee and tastes like it. I can't complain much at about $3 a pound but it's just ok, drinkable, but wouldn't buy again."
4,"Nice, smooth espresso","My favorite coffee changed their beans and I no longer liked it, so I have been looking for a new brand. Out of 4 I tried, this one is the best. Some of the brands I tried just didn't have that real Espresso flavor. This one does."
1,Bad Beans!,"Life is too short to drink bad coffee and these beans make bad coffee. I have a Compak commercial grinder, a Pasquini Livia 90 espresso machine and the experience to use them. The beans are dry, the flavor is sour and thin. These are the worst beans I have ever tried and we have thrown them out. A waste of money."
4,It's nice but I doubt it will last long,"I do love the bed, my fiance and I do not like headboards so this was a perfect match. Of course it seemed like I paid more for shipping then the actual bed. I would however say that this is for first time bed buyers, it isn't a great investment but will do well for at least a good year."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,This seemed like it would be fine. Some of the boards weren't pre-drilled and so it wouldn't fit together good enough. It is sloped badly and I need to borrow a drill to drill the holes where they should be. It wasn't easy to put together and I was very disappointed.I wouldn't buy this or recommend buying it.
2,Not for Long Dog or Cat Hair,"Even though there's a picture of a Dog on the box this machine will not work for that kind of Vacuuming. The long dog hairs just wrap around the beater brush and cause a big mess. Very little of the hair acually made it to the waste bin. If you don't mind dismantling the brushes every time that you use it, then i guess it would be OK. But be prepared for 15 minutes of disassemble and cleanup with each use.The manufacturer needs to figure out how to transport long dog or cat hairs past the brush assembly. Until they do that i wouldn't buy this vacuum. And they should take the picture of the Dog (and the Dog hair on the carpet) off of the box.Other than the hair problem, the unit seemed to work fairly well."
2,an expensive toy,"Yes it vacuums but not well and not anything big, if you want a robotic vacuum that does what your human powered vacuum does now, wait."
1,"bad start, no remote",We were led to believe unit came with remote. It did not. Units of compariable price in retail stores come with remote.Unit avaiable on A S shopping network for less including remote. This is probably last years model. Great entertainment for pets not much good for humans
5,This is a VACUUM!,This is a wonderful product (even if it can't really suck your pants off); I am finding that my carpet was not nearly as well vacuumed as I thought it would be with a Windtunnel. The only disadvantage is that one has to constantly keep the lint tray cleaned out--as it is small. Well worth the money.
2,"Died After One Month, Short Warranty","I bought one and couldn't rave enough about it. Then the thing died after one month's use. I lost the receipt and so couldn't take it back. I really like the concept and would even consider buying another, but the warranty is only good for 90 days. $200 is a lot of money to spend for only one month or three month's use. They need to improve the durability of the product AND extend the warranty."
3,Forget High Pile Carpets,"It's nice for under bed or under furniture, if it fits, so not to have to move of lift them. I like it for floors and it works great. Carpet cleaning only so so. Low pile fine, high pile no way. Sometimes heat vents in the floor cause it to stop for no apparent reason. If I were the manufacturer I'd add a bit more AI or verbal warnings saying it's stuck or battery getting low or getting near completion. In a few years, if still being made, I'd say improvements will be more fun to watch or listen to than actually doing what it was designed for. Would I get another one, yeah!"
2,Roomba Pro - worse than the original,"I have purchased three Roomba's. The latest, a Roomba Pro, seems to have far more troubles than the original. It gets stuck on simple trim and even in corners (it is calling me now to free it again). I was happy with the first version (despite some reliability issues); I was hoping that Irobot would work towards improving the product but so far am not thrilled. It is a great concept, the execution is frustrating."
4,We Love it!,"We recently had hardwood floors installed throughout most of our house and found our vacuum cleaner did not get them as clean as we would like so I started looking for other options besides Swifter and found the iRobot. This device does a good job and as a bonus is entertaining!I give it a room to clean while I get ready for work in the morning and away it goes. The down side I found is because it rides so close to the floor the bottom gets dusty, sometimes leaving a little dust on throw rugs it goes across, but otherwise we are very pleased with it. It does a great job getting under the bed!"
1,VERY CHEAP - RETURNED IMMEDIATELY,"I gave it 1 star because it would not let me leave NO STARS...what a piece of junk. Thin razor sharp edges like tin - would have DEFINITELY SCRATCHED MY WATCH if I installed it...lightweight cheap links...big fat ""MADE IN CHINA"" sticker on it. What garbage. I sent it right back. Amazon should really be more descriptive and post more detailed large pics of junk like this so people who appreciate QUALITY do not have to waste their time with junk like this."
3,Half-romance/half sea story,"I loved the Patrick O'Brian series --- the greatest historical fiction I've ever read --- and that is what led me to sample this. Well, it is like comparing Raymond Chandler to James Patterson: other than a similar topic, there really is no comparison. Taken on its own terms, this book was certainly readable, the plot moves along in its Napoleonic setting, reliably providing the cliched developments of battles and courtships that are cliched precisely because they are comfortable and comforting. Nothing more than that here though. FYI, the story spends as much time on the romance, including detailed description of the wedding, as it does at sea."
4,Great Book,"I wanted to read the Hornblower or Aubrey/Maturin series but the publishers of these apparently not only write about the 19th century, they also must live in it since they are not available on the Kindle!!This did lead me to these books and I am glad it did as I have enjoyed them a lot."
4,Enjoyable,"My husband and I enjoyed this book. It's not quite Patrick O'Brian, but it's still well worth reading. I enjoyed the romance as well as the sea battles, and there's some humor too; as the author, perhaps taking a lesson from O'Brian (who created such a memorable twosome with Aubrey and Maturin), has provided his young captain with a first lieutenant who is also a personal friend, and who likes to take the captain down a peg or two with some ribbing occasionally. We're looking forward to the next book."
1,Below C-level Naval Story,"Go read Marryat, Lambdin, or O'Brian if you're looking for great sea stories. This doesn't measure up. Edgemont has no distinguishing characteristics except that he will sacrifice any shred of honor, integrity or moral courage to win his Quaker girlfriend. In fact, his Quaker girlfriend gives up her religious beliefs for him as well, so the whole tale sinks into a post-modern relativist morass disguised as nautical fiction. The characters are shallow, the ""action"" is thin and predictable, and to spice things up, another author's fictional character makes an appearance.There is nothing to love about Edgemont and I only finished the book out of a seriously misplaced sense of obligation.Any resemblance to to nautical fiction is highly improbable."
4,Coccyx seat cushion,This oroduct provides the addiotnal height I require to to easily et up from a couch or chair. It also provides comfortable sitting for prolong periods. I would purchase again.Fleece Coccyx Wedge Seat Cushion with Handle
2,Not comfortable,"I have a cushion identical to this.This one does not feel the same, too hard.Also,the cover on this one arrived very wrinkled,perhaps because of the packing and the cover fitstoo snugly on the cushion itself so I couldn'tunzip it to iron it out."
5,light & loud,Good whistle for coaching and getting the players attention. It would work for ref also. I have also placed one in the car for emergencies.
5,A real attention-getter.,"Look no further for the perfect whistle for everything from refereeing a game to traffic direction. The Fox 40 is small, lightweight, comfortable to use for extended periods of time, and oh...did I mention LOUD? The harder you blow, the louder it is. A Must have for coaches, referees, and cops."
5,Loud good whistle.,"It's a simple whistle without any moving parts, so there isn't much that can go wrong. It is comfortable on the lips when blowing it. The lanyard works nice, and it makes a nice loud sound. It's working well for sports and I would expect it to work well as an emergency whistle, too."
4,It does ok,Its a good whistle except for the break away part which will break with normal wear after about 3 uses. I just threw away the clip and re-hooked the whistle into the metal piece.
3,Not so hot.,"The holster broke apart as soon as my grandson (3 years) put it on. The red rivets fell off, we tried to fix it but stayed broke. Hopefully we can glue it, my grandson loves portraying a cowboy."
4,"Fun for my son, not like the main picture.","My almost 4 year old got this to go with his cowboy costume for Halloween. He loves it. It's not at all like the first picture above, make sure you look at the second photo for what it really looks like. Overall, it's worth the $13 bucks or so and my son really loves to play with it. Too bad he already lost one of the guns!"
5,This is really neat!,"This toy does exactely what it says in the decription. I bought thistoy for my 5 and 7 year old children. My 5 year old is not strong enoughto pump it up yet, but my 7 year old can. It is definately an outside and with younger children would need to be used with supervision. Does go about 60 feet and works pretty easily. My 7 year old son thinks it's the coolest thing ever!"
1,Not a wise choice!,"If you are a fan of Caetano Veloso, ""DO NOT BUY "" this DVD, you will be disspointed if you do, it is only a collection of his music with pictures of Veloso, no live performance or music video, it is a waste of money and for that price, you can buy a nice collection of his cd's or a better DVD, like ""Caballero de Fina Estampa"".buyer beware, this DVD, is a bad choice, who wants to listen to music on DVD?, for that, we already have CD'S, and for a fraction of the price!"
3,electrical & eletronics,"I, intrested in eletrical & electronics booklet. thank you. waiting for feed back."
3,It's not what i'm use to.,"I have seen this movie and am not impressed with it I take Tai'Chi at Meritcare Medical Center in Fargo,ND Begginers Class and some of the moves are the same but ours are more Relaxing we do things like Pulse the Monkey White CraneFlashes Wing and so on and so forth I would prefer more deep breathing moves."
2,I disagree with the other reviews,"Maybe somebody can learn tai chi from this, but not me. The problem is everything is too fast. The techniques are not demonstrated slowly enough to follow."
3,i'm a beginner so anything is good,"As a beginner, this tape was very helpful. Carradine is very patient and repetitive in his teaching. i only wish that there was another tape that furthers the 9 movements of the first tape. i really want to get into the Chen style of Tai Chi, because it is the original style, but all other intructional videos are either the Wu or Yang style."
3,what about David's book with the same name?,"I assumed that a video by the same author and with the same name would go with and build on the book. This is not the case. I got the book and found it very useful but, as is often the case with exercise books, it is sometimes hard to figure out how the moves go. I hoped the video would help me to do this, but not at all. The video has a very different work out. If you have the book and want MORE tai chi drills, you might want the video, but if you want more detail on the exercises in the book, it will disappoint you."
1,David Carradine's Star Trek,This has got to be the worst video I have ever seen. The ever changing back ground made me feel like I was watching a Star Trek movie. It looked like they were being beamed around everywhere. At times I felt sea sick. I was really looking forward to this tape. How disappointing it is.
5,Relaxing and effective,I loved this video. It has a very relaxed style and the moves were done repeatedly and slowly and so are easy to learn. at the end of the tape there is a section where it is all put together at a faster speed so you can use that once you master the moves. they describe tai chi as moving meditation and this tape certainly demonstrates that. I have found it calming and a great gentle exercise for the body. The music and back drops are great. Highly recommended.
2,Easy to follow at first....,"I was encouraged by the beginner pace when I first began viewing this tape, but I found that as the video progressed, the movements were more difficult to follow. I am very familiar and comfortable with Chi Kung and was very interested in learning a Tai Chi form. I consider myself well coordinated and a fast learner. I've heard that you can't really learn Tai Chi from a video, but with my hectic schedule, I'm still hopeful I'll find the right video."
3,Possibly a motivating tape for anyone with an illness,"I am about half way through this tape. The video starts off with a testimonial from a woman who feels that tai chi helped her beat cancer. David claims various moves should cure or prevent various ailments and keep specific organs healthy. If you have an illness, this might be a very motivating tape because you certainly will not feel alone and you may develop a re-affirmed feeling of hope and motivation.My main objective was to relieve back pain. I liked the first two sections of the first tape better for this purpose. The rest of the first tape is proving difficult to follow. Kinda of like learning dance steps without being able to see the instructors feet."
2,Farily good,"A slick, eye pleasing production, but it is too choppy and hard to follow. Just as I begin to get the hang of a movement, the camera switches to a different person AND camera angle. It's not bad for the price though (get what you pay for)."
1,Give me a break,"David Carradine is an actor, not a martial artist. This tape is not Tai chi (more commonly 'Taiji' if you are Chinese). It ain't Yang style, it ain't Chen style, it ain't nothin'! I studied both styles under a master from China for several years and this does not even resemble the real Taiji!"
4,Easy to learn and relaxing.,"My wife and I purchased the Tai Chi workout video and found it to be a very informative and satisfying workout for the mind,body and soul. We feel this is a routine we can incorporate in our everyday living.It's well worth the price and time invested."
5,Excellent Softball Hitting Video,I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn to properly hit in softball. The material is very thorough and there are several people presenting their tips which is highly useful!
5,Gerald Morris ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is my favorite book of all time. One of Gerald Morris's best books it is a definite good read. A story full of humor anyone who loves reading Camelot stories should read this book. It's a book that all ages should read.
5,"A short, clear and concise overview of the Republic.","""The Weimar Republic"" is a quick read into the complicated history of Germany's first attempt at parliamentary democracy. Henig focuses on domestic political and economic developments to provide students and the general reader with an overview of the period.Such issues discussed are domestic responses to the Versailles Treaty, the failure of the left to deal realistically with the problems of liberal and mass government, the inability of the bourgeoisie parties to find mass support for party rule, and the designs of the right to undermine the parliamentary system altogether. Within this framework Henig includes all the major points such as nationalism, patriotism, workers unions, the landed class, and the successive economic crises that plagued the Republic. At the same time, the book also provides clues to the rise of parliamentary government in post-1945 West Germany."
2,It seems to leak.,"I bought this on sale at Big Five. Used it once in the Trinity R. at a kayak launch with strong current out in the middle, and rapids below with no place to get out for a few miles. But I just went out from one small launch area to another and paddled back under the brush. It touched brush and although it was not stuck, it also seemed to leak from thed time I ""put in"". The valve lets air out if you squeeze it. I could not see any bubbles coming out from the one I could check in the water. Had a great time, but it started deflating by itself on the way back. It is now over half deflated. I paid $10 for it. I never used one before and there were NO real instructions. Just said to blow it up, period. We did not know, and blew it up with a bicycle pump. It took forever. I think a gas station pump might work, but, not sure. I'm returning it. I wish I knew why it leaked."
3,Dependable,"If you are one of those who wants to go toobing(.net) once or twice a summer, the River Rat is fine for you since they are fairly cheap. HOWEVER, if you plan on toobing(.net) in the sun (duh?) the River Rat's surface will be hot enough for you to cook bacon on since it's black. So you will have to splash water on the sides of it constantly to keep it cool.We always give the noobs on our trip the River Rat so that way they can appreciate the better floats that are out there!Holds air just fine. Has 2 air chambers (1 is a safety)."
1,Piece of junk,"When blowing it up (well before it was full), the seams next to the blow up hole split apart. It was about 5 degrees F and the cold seems to make the material it's made with brittle. I saw the other bad reviews prior to purchasing, and was just hoping those other bad reviews were for rare circumstances with those specific people. But this really is a pretty low quality product."
1,I don't think they even have a customer service department,"I couldnt find the lead time until it was too late. I got the tubes after I needed them. I tried to email True Value's customer service, since there wasn't a number and Amazon said they couldn't really help. I haven't used the tubes yet, but don't want to pay shipping/restocking fees. So overall, I am sure the product is fine, service terrible!!!"
4,Lazy day on the stream,Very decent product. Valves make it slow to inflate and deflate. Held up well over rocks in lower stretches of the stream. Made for a fun family experience. Overall a good product.
5,Tubes,They r great for the river! We use them all summer long. They last 2-3 years would buy them again
1,Can't hold air,I purchased the tube and when it was delivered it was defective. There was a tear in the part you blow up so the tube wouldn't hold air. I was unable to patch this part of the tube so it was never used!
4,For Our Pool,"Bought this one to replace one that we have had for several years. Nice for the pool, but I don't think that this is tough enough to handle tubing on the lake."
3,Poor reproductions of photographs,"I found this print of the manual frustrating to use because of the poor quality of the photograph reproductions. At Maritime.org the photographs are MUCH clearer, though you cannot print it without screwing up the text.It's maddening.They need to do a reprint with clearer manuals and fold-outs of some of the back diagrams."
5,Owner's manual for a submarine,"Practically anything you would want to know about operation and care of a WWII sub. Some of the pictures didn't reproduce too well, but that's a common problem with books that are reproductions.Lot's on insights on this subject, and very interesting.I just wish that Periscopefilm hadn't put their web address on the top of each page."
3,An Average Recording,"The sound and picture quality of the DVD is not bad. The sound is not we ordinary expected from a live recording in a church. However, with the assistance of the sound processing facilities of my surround amplifier, the sound is improved remarkably. I recommend viewers of this DVD to use a sound processor to simulate an European Hall effect for better listening."
1,What a dissapointment,"I bought this DVD just as soon as it was released. I am totally dissatisfied. It is a Dolby recording but the camera work is a quality of amateurs, the performance is the one you typically hear at a local church rather than something you are willing to pay to hear."
1,For $2.98 it is OK,"Either the cameras used were of low quality, or the DVD was copied from a VHS tape. I did not care for the production at all. Too much soloists not enough choir. I will either throw away or give to the library."
2,not even close to 10 hours,"I bought the n-charge system and tried it with my Sony notebook computer. The product said that you would be able to watch 3 dvd's, etc. with the time allotted. I ran the system quite a few times to give it a chance to break in. It never provided more than 4 hours and five minutes of continuous use...1.5 - 2 movies. More than the battery that came with my computer, but not even close to 10 hours worth. I'm glad that Brookstone has such a good return policy."
1,Worthless,"Battery pack arrived with the following message. ""Cable NOT included, please ask salesperson for details."" So much for my impending business trip."
2,Too short Lived,"This item only lasted about 6 months before it died. While it worked, it was great, but I was extremely dissappointed in the time before it died. The problem is that there is no automatic shutoff. My dog or one of my children must have stepped on the switch for the heat which burnt the fuse and ended up frying the entire massager.I would highly recommend looking for one with an automatic shutoff."
5,To Be Shared,"I purchased two of these DVDs after first seeing it on the local PBS channel so I could circulate these among my friends and those that are important to me. Stress is everywhere, some self imposed and others external. Understanding Stress is as important as understanding what diet is best for you. Share this with your friends and you will be doing them a great favor."
3,Not bad but need more details on human behavior,"I hope during the 30 years period of research, he would have simultaneously studied human behavior & their effects. We are already aware that the stress is the root cause of most of human problems. The study should give what are the internal reactions in human body & how to overcome those. They didn't mention about Adrenaline at all, produced by the adrenal glands playing an important role in short-term stress reaction.But it's a good material to know more about stress."
3,Stressed by an inflexible DVD!,"Although I like this DVD, I would never get this DVD again, as it doesn't seem to let me select different parts to watch at any one time! It keeps telling me that that is forbidden. I have to watch it from the beginning and then restart the next time either at where I left off the last time or at the beginning. However, there are times when I simply want to review one section in particular. Such inflexibility in a DVD -- up with which I will not put!"
4,"No, Corporations Don't Kill. They Simply Empower Managers to Produce Stress that Does It for Them.","This is a very insightful DVD. Well worth viewing. When it's over, you may find yourself wondering why the law hasn't adopted a similarly informed perspective relative to the conduct of employers, employee complaints, and the need for related investigations in the context of corporate policies."
5,Everyone should know this about themselves,"Very thought provoking. We all have to deal with stress in our lives. I am been a very active, athletic person all my life. Just ran my third marathon. I have brothers and sisters who have not taken of their bodies very well but I am the only one who has had a heart attack. I lost my wife to breast cancer after a long stressful battle. This documentary reaffirms my life story to a T. Very entertaining and if you do not think this applies to you. There is someone who you are close to certainly could benefit from this."
5,WE're not that different than Baboons,It's been said that we're monkeys with car keys and IMO that's true OO OO OO OO OO OO OO This Video proves it.
2,Returned immediately,"Did not fit my teaching needs that inspired the purchase. Very little about effects of stress on physical and mental health in humans, ways to cope better with stress. Great service from Amazon.com on return/quick refund, thanks!"
5,Sand & Water Activity Center,"My daughter is 20 months old, she loves splashing around and playing with this... this was a worthwhile purchase."
5,Kids love this - lots of fun,"This is a great water table. My kids love it (ages 1 and 3). They drive matchbox size tractors and bulldozers around the sand area to build roads and come up with lots of different ways to enjoy the sand and water. The umbrella is a great addition for the shade.I rated 3 for durability because we've had it for 2 years and the center is beginning to droop. This causes the the water to run into the sand side before the rest of the water side fills up. It bugs me, but my kids don't seem to notice or care. I might just put a support of some kind under the center of the table to level it back out. Would be nice if this was built in from the get-go. Overall a great product that provides hours of outdoor imaginative play, and other than the drooping issue it has withstood 2 years of play and I expect it last several more."
3,Step 2 Sand Box,"The sand box itself is nice and provides a great play area for the kids. The top is nice, too - - keeping the wind, rain (and cats!) out of it. However, the umbrella and its pole leave a little to be desired. The pole is flimsy and has bent several times, just in regular usage. The stems of the umbrella have broken, again, just in regular usage. Considering that it is an outdoors product, it would have been nice to see the umbrella be a little more sturdy. The kids still play a lot with the sand box, even though the umbrella damage happened within the first 1-3 weeks of getting it."
4,Great - keeps my 2-year-old busy for a long time!,"We got this for my son's 2nd birthday in September, and it's been a hit ever since his party, where multiple toddlers were practically fighting to play in it (good thing it came with a selection of toys, plus I threw in a bunch more cups, shovels, bath toys, etc. for them all to share). Unlike most of his toys, it will keep him engrossed for a good half hour at a time, with nary a peep (or ""Mommy, come play with me!"") We keep it outside, and fill both sides with water, based on the comments here that using both sand and water will lead to messy mixing.... The umbrella has been very useful in our Indian summer heat, and when it gets too cold to keep water in it (my son always ends up a wet mess) I plan to fill it with rice or beans for the winter."
3,leaky,"Looks great, but leaks. Very disappointing since it could have been made differently so that the leg attachment didn't risk possible leaking. My little 2 yr. old likes it well enough...so we'll probably try to caulk the leg joints."
3,Leaky and unstable,"In theory this is a great toy, but the truth is that the water sides leak, so put this outside where you don't mind a watery mess underneath it. The table merely ""rests"" upon the legs; the legs don't snap into the table, and the table isn't steady on the legs. The umbrella shaft is too short, thus making the umbrella very low, and children bump into it. I had to get a 4 foot length of PVC pipe to lengthen the umbrella shaft. If you don't mind the leak, it's a great toy. My kids love it, and it's in the yard where the leak doesn't matter. You can get this at Menard's for $49.95, but check the packaging. The umbrella was broken in the first one we bought, and I had to exchange it."
4,Wish I'd bought this earlier,"It's almost too hot in the south right now for an outdoor toy, but I can see that although my timing was off the choice of this sand/water table was a good one. The table arrived in perfect condition, not even a ding on the box. The put together went smoothly. There was one leg-leak issue with the first water fill, however, some applied sealant (that we had on hand) and a double layer of clear packing table has made the table watertight. The umbrella is surprisingly sturdy. I would buy this item again (for the price I paid) in a heartbeat. I noticed that amazon has jacked the price up now and the seller is Target? Perhaps we got the last one?"
5,Granddaughter delight,"I purchased this for my two granddaughters 1 year old and 3 years old. Because the one year old is too young for sand, we just fill both sides with water and even the 1 year old enjoys spashing in the water with her little fish and rubber ducks. The 3 year old has no problem climbing into it to cool off on a summer day. She enjoys using it to fish with her play fish and fishing pole. It is the perfect height for standing and playing. The girls enjoy it now with just water and will enjoy it in future years when sand is added. It was easy to assemble and the umbrella provides good cover to protect from heat and sun. We have the Naturally playful sandbox as well and love these products."
5,Every kid should have one,"I've had this for a year and it's great. During colder weather I don't put water in it, but my little boys don't care, though it's more fun with water. Yes, they will mix the sand and water and they will dump the sand on the ground. I had this on my patio where I could sweep up the sand. Right now it's on my wooden 2nd-floor deck, and I just sweep the spilled sand off so that it falls through the boards. I did try to glue the 2 bridges on since they don't stay put with the heavy toy car traffic we have, but the glue didn't hold. I like that the lid attaches securely so it can't blow away, and I like that the umbrella is included with the table (with other brands you buy it seperately). My 14-month old can easily reach the sand and he loves to play with this, too."
4,Use it only for sand,"Excellent durability, lots of fun, convinient umbrella - but the sand and water DOES mix. It is true for all other tables so best is to use it for sand only..."
3,B-Day Gift,I bought this sand and water activity for my daugtgther for her 3rd B-Day. She's really love it. The thing I don't like is the water mess up with the sand when she played.
4,a fun toy,I was all set to purchase a similar product but instead bought this one based on all the positive customer reviews. They were very helpful!I found that this table was very easy to assemble because I opted to leave off the leg anchor screws. (I tried using a regular screwdriver as suggested in the instructions - very unrealistic!) The weight of the water and sand seemed adequate enough to make the table stable.The umbrella was a great idea to include.The only problem that I can see is whether or not one would care if the water and sand get mixed together - it's impossible to keep them mutally exclusive while the kids are playing and experimenting.
2,Mediocre toy for an anal retentive parent,"From a parent's perspective, I think this toy is mediocre. For the money, you would be just as wise to purchase a normal sandbox & swimming pool. The sand and the water are constantly mixed together. The sand constantly is spilled over the edge. The overall sandbox is much smaller than you think. The positives to this sandbox are: the umbrella to protect your child from the sun and a toddler can stand next to the sandbox instead of in it (which prevents sand from getting buried in their clothes, hair, etc). I think if this toy was less expensive, I would like it more."
2,Legs are horrible,"We were very excited when my 2 year old son got this for his birthday last year; he loved playing with it. Unfortunately, the legs on this are horrible! Even though we keep this on a flat surface, our deck, the legs did not stay straight. They are flimsy and only held ""in place"" by screws. As much as we tried to prop them straight with cement blocks, they just got worse. I would recommend buying a table with sturdier legs than this one. We now have to go buy a new one because this one did not hold up. Our son never sat in it or climbed on it to make the legs buckle, just in case you are wondering!"
5,Very entertaining and durable!,"My three boys love this table, we bought it to put rice and/or beans in it in the house however we haven't got there they just love to drive there matchbox cars and trains on them. There is so many things you can do with this, as we probably will put it outside come summer. It's very strong and has held up well, it can even hold little boys!?!"
5,Naturally Playful Sand and Water Activity Center,"Great, durable product. Easy to assemble. Kids of all ages can enjoy this toy."
4,Perfect if you only have a balcony or deck,"we only have a small balcony, and this product fits perfectly on it. Our son LOVES the water portion of the table...I am really glad we bought this table versus some of the others we looked at that just contained sand."
5,Love it!,"The ""Easter Bunny"" left this toy for my daughter on Easter Sunday. The moment she saw it, she ran straight to it and played with it for an hour (she probably would have played longer had we not have to leave). Everyday, this is the one toy that she plays with and never gets bored. Like the other comments, I do find the legs wobbly and she does get sand in the water and vice versa. The lid, when used properly, does indeed protect the sand from insects and rain. Overall, I think the Easter Bunny did a great job when choosing this for her Easter gift."
2,problems with table,"It is a great table however after a short period of time, water leaks out of the hole and the table is sunk a little in the middle. I believe it is defective however its not like I can send it back. do you have any suggestions."
2,Wobbly Legs!,"My son received this for his 2nd birthday. He loves playing with it, but I am very disappointed with the lack of sturdiness of the legs. It is on our back patio & has not been moved around and 1 of the legs is already buckling in. We have several Step 2 products and have been very pleased, but the quality of this one is pretty poor."
3,The legs fill with water; table leaks,"I agree with most positive reviews of the table. The table is fun and sturdy and the kids love it. It blends with the natural decor of our yard and deck. The only drawback - and it's a big one - is that IT LEAKS. It will not retain water and even more puzzling is that the legs on the table remain full of water! I don't know how to ""drain them"" without drilling holes in the plastic. I am in the process of trying to get a replacement table, but I may be out of warranty. I just thought I'd share my experience. I am dissapointed in the leaking, but I can't say that my kids haven't enjoyed the table anyway..."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My son loves this activity center and I love not having to clean sandy diapers!!! Note: this does not come with sand, so make sure you purchase sand that is specifically designed for children (i.e. pre-washed and non-toxic if eaten)."
5,Works great--solves problem of mounting gate to open spindle stairway,"The Kidco pressure mount spring gate is great--really well made and easy to use-- I have two of them. The Y-mount allows the gate to be used on open stairways with spindles. I used it one one side (the other has a solid wall) and it is very secure. I use it at the bottom of the stairs for a puppy. Even though it mounts very securely, I might not recommend it for use at the top of a stairway if there is a strong, active toddler in the house. Overall great product--exactly what I needed."
3,Didn't work for our wrought iron gate problem,"This was an ideal solution except the distance between the wrought iron rail (where the spindle was going) and the gate was too big, which caused the gate to be extremely unstable as it was literally extended to its last thread. This is because the bottom tension rod on the gate was against the base board, and the top was against the rail (2 inch difference). A larger gate was not an option, as the one we had was the largest that fit. I returned and opted for the Kidco gate installation kit which included a piece of wood that we zip-tied onto the railing, allowing for the top tension rod to fit securely against the railing. Problem solved!"
4,Kidco Y Spindle,"I purchased this tension gate because I didn't want to put holes into my framework. We bought to keep our dog confined to an area in the house. It holds securely to the molding when tightened properly. The only downside is that it's hard to open gate with one hand because of the handle mechanism.Sincerely,Cleo"
5,What would congress do?,"What would Congress do it they were able to use Maruska's decision making process instead of the arcane and antiquated procedures they do today? Produce meaningful health care reform? Lower the deficit? Raise their own approval ratings?This common sense approach works well in practice as well as theory. I use it my business, with clients, and with a not for profit, whose Board I sit on. Even though the process may seem time intensive, it ends up saving time as well as lots of acrimony and meaningless debate.I find myself buying additional copies to replace the ones I give to other people who really seem to need it."
1,bilge,"Even if there are some useful ideas in this book, Maruska's horrendous writing style and touchy-feely approach to business problems leave me unable to take him seriously. ""Be an agent of hope."" ""Discover your shared hopes."" ""Be a mirror, not a sponge."" ""Get in a circle, hold hands, and sing Cumbaya."" (the last one is mine, but it fits right in.) Blecch."
3,Life...ok or not?,The cd 'Life' was very mixed. It included slow songs to the very fast rap songs. R-Kelly really had not too much to do with it besides editing it. He's just on the cd so it would sell more.
4,I like this CD!!,"The LIFE cd wasn't that interesting to me, but when I heard Kelly Price's ""It's Gonna Rain"" (I'm not sure what the title is) I was like ""Oh my God"" this song makes all the difference on this CD. But it's tight!!!"
3,ONLY TWO,THE TWO BEST SONGS FROM THIS ALBUM ARE:Maxwell's FortunateKelly Price's Its Gonna Rainand Maybe Brian MCknight's Discovery
2,Very Average,One Would Think That R.Kelly&Wyclef would have Come Correct on A Project together? think Again.Aside from Fourtunate by Maxwell which was written By R.Kelly Nothing else matches it.I was Hyped about DJ QUIK&R.KELLY working together but it was more Business than any good results.it should have been better.
3,To sum it up- this album is luke-warm.,"The opening track ""25 to life"" gets this soundtrack rolling. The next cut ""It,s Like Everyday"", which was produced by DJ Quik is laced with beats so tight and so smooth that you will push playback again and again. While there are several misses on this soundtrack, such as ""Every Which Way"", a song produced by his royal freakness- R. Kelly- has solid beats, but the artists on this cut should definitely find another job. There are bright moments on this cd. One of these moments shows on the smooth ballad ""Fortunate"". Maxwell lays plush, sultry, and orgasmic vocals over an even sultrier track. Maxwell along with K-Ci and JoJo are the saviors for this soundtrack. Speaking of K-Ci and JoJo, I will let you discover for yourself the magnificent gem that is called ""Life""."
4,PRETTY GOOD SOUNDTRACK,"THE SOUNDTRACK IS GOOD. MY FAVORITE IS THE SONG BY KCI AND JOJO CALLED ""LIFE"". THAT SONG IS GOING OFF, IT BRINGS THE ENTIRE SOUNDTRACK OUT!!!"
5,NICE AND TRENDY,LOVE this product!!! nice and trendy way of keeping my computer stuff organized!!! LOVE IT!
3,Serves no purpose for me...,"I purchased this thinking that my gadgets/cords would fit in the pockets of this bag. I have a mac laptop and the power-cord is wider than most. It doesn't fit in a pocket with the cord part wrapped around it. Basically, I don't see a point in using this bag. For some other people, it might serve a purpose, but for me, my things don't fit in there nice and neat like I would prefer. I might as well use a paper bag."
3,Simple alternations would make for a much better bag,"The pockets on this thing were too small and I expected an open central space. There wasn't one; instead there was lots of wasted fabric in the form of a weird wad of fabric used to make the central division in the bag. Instead of having, say, pockets created on the inside surface of the bag, a double layer of fabric was sewn into pockets. I just picked out the stitching for the two end pockets and wound up with two nice large pockets; perfect!"
4,Pretty Pockets too small,"I bought this to go with the laptop sleeve. It has pockets inside and is pictured holding what looks like a mac laptop charger of some sort. It doesn't really fit the charger for my macbook well. I have to put the power brick part in one pocket and the rest of the cord wound between two other pockets. Unless your laptop's power brick is exceedingly small, I don't recommend this bag for it. Buy the lunch bag instead. I ended up using this bag for cosmetics and toiletries when I travel."
5,nice snug fit!,Love this companion to my laptop sleeve. It fits all my computer tools stylishly snug!
2,Doesn't work very well for hot pans.,"I bought these for our catering business, we can't ever keep ours clean and have to constantly throw them away because most oven mitts aren't washable. I found these on the internet and bought to pairs, the first time we used them the hot pan started to melt through the mitt, if you pick up pans that are coming out of an oven around 400 degree's you better have a place to set it right away because the heat comes right through them. If they were a little heavier made and a little bigger they would be perfect. They are very nice when it comes to cleaning them, but for hot pans and large hands they aren't very good."
3,Silicone,"Great that it's silicone, but we found them difficult and clumsy. Too bad, I'd rather have all silicone mitts since they're so easy to clean and don't catch fire ;)"
3,Uncomfortable but they work.,They feel very strange especially if your hands are a bit damp. But they do a stellar job of preventing burns.
1,BUYER BEWARE !,"Lekue silicone pan came apart after some months of occasional use. The customer service is in Barcelona, and unless you speak Spanish you cannot even explain the problem to them - never mind expecting any kind of support in the United States from a customer service that is located in Spain.This product comes de facto without manufacture's warranty although you could send it back to Amazon within 30 days. Very disappointing product."
4,Great Pop Tarts,"I am not sure why I bought these, I maybe thought they just looked good. I didn't realize I was buying so many when they came. This is like buying bulk at costco which I probably could have gotten cheaper there. Anyways, the taste on these things is a little more than average, they taste good. My favorite will always be S'mores though and I think a lot of people will agree. These taste just like a cinnamon bun though and are pretty good. 4 Stars out of 5."
5,Metallic Space Pop,"I picked this up used after hearing ""Sermon Underground"" on a CMJ sampler disc. The rest of the album is just as good. Imagine a successful fusion of the best qualities of The Smithereens and Blue Oyster Cult, with the digital sheen of Depeche Mode ( though otherwise the DM comparison is pretty invalid, IMHO )and you've got some approximation of this band's sound. It takes two or three spins to get fully acclimated, but there really aren't any clunkers on this album. If you like catchy, spacy alterna-pop, get it."
1,Dividers SOLD SEPARATELY!!!!!,Stack-on Products do not come with the proprietary dividers for their proprietary drawers. When I emailed them about it they sent back an order form for 2.50 for a pack and 4.05 in shipping pre-inlcuded and no apologies that they weren't just selling their dividers next to their products at Home Depot.Plus it would take 2 weeks for delivery.This company deserves to go under in the next two weeks.
4,overall a nice cabinet,"i am totally satisfied with my purchase of stack on cabinet.I purchased it to store little houshold stuff like buttons,artificial jewelry,cable connectors etc etc..The only complaint i have is some of drawers are misaligned and you may feel that only when you are taking them out or closing them-i don't think shipping has anything to do with it as they were packed nicely and securely.mostly the ones at bottom row.Also It would be nice if manufacturer provided courtesy dividers instead of offering them seperately."
3,Stack-On DS-22 22 Drawer Storage Cabinet ...,"The cabinet is great, however, the inserts/dividers are not included with this unit and are sold separately! That is most inconvenient."
4,"Not bad, could be better","Like everyone else, I wish they had the dividers included with the box, but it's a great little organizer. Some of the drawers had burrs left over from the injection port when they were molded. These prevented them from sliding out all the way. I took a knife and trimmed them off, then they worked flawlessly. I would definitely recommend these for the price."
4,Great cool book,This is a great cook book for those looking for good suggestions and recipes for lowing cholesterol as well as losing weight.The book begins with a two week diet (eating 6 times a day) to get you going.The recipes are easy to make and tastey. You don't have to give up flavor for low cholesterol eating.
2,Pass on this one...,"I have to wonder when this book was originally written or, more importantly, from what time period these recipes are from. I leafed through the entire book and all I found were old, boring receipes.The use, or lack thereof, of the latest healthy ingredients is a giveaway to the age of the recipes. These recipes lacked such ingredients. They might be good for cholesterol control but these were definitely not recipes I could get excited about using.Look for something more up-to-date."
4,the historical insight,Learning about how ideas came into being has given me a better appreciation of this field. I definitely recommend to this book to complement one's study of genetics.
1,Just a quick caution.....,"I was really excited about this game; it sounded really cool.But after I had played it for 45 min.,I died(like I had so many times before), and so did the game.It caused MAJOR problems for my computer, and it took a while to fix it. Don't buy this unless you are abseloutely sure it will work."
4,Is it the best yet?,"I have play every Star Wars games for PC since the original X-Wing, and I just found what I really want in this game. Finally I found that the more I get into this game, the more I want from it. However, it would be nice if Lucasarts will ever release the games base on the original Star Wars using this engine and this style of gameplay. C'Mon Lucas, many people out here still want to play as Luke Skywalker and Han Solo! END"
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun, Fun","This game is so fun! You can play as Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, Panka, or Queen Amidala. The graphics are awesome. I recomend you buy this game. END"
4,A good adventure game,There weren't enough levels in this game and the graphics where too 2D in some parts. Other than that it's a great game. The action is great and the storyline is pretty good. However Mos Espa is too confusing and Darth Maul is too easy both times you fight him. The game also needed to stay closer to the movie. Other than that it's a great game.
3,disappointing,"gameplay is ok but controls are bad, good sounds and cinematics but it feels stiff... I expected more after the Racer game(which is cool)"
2,Poorly Executed,"This game had a lot of potential, no matter how lame the movie may have been. The graphics were good (especially the lighting efects), but the polygonal characters... frankly, they stank. I know Lucas Arts can produce MUCH better titles than this, after having played Jedi Knight and Pod Racer I know it's possible. But this one was rushed to the point of releasing on beta level! The sounds were great, just as most of the other Lucas Arts games are. They are usually pulled straight out of the movie. The most annoying aspect of the game was the camera angle. What were they thinking! You could barely see in front of you. It would have been better for a completely overhead view, than that annoying angle, in which you couldn't see twenty feet. Anyway... I'm not even going to waste my time writing about a game I was sorely disapointed with."
5,*GET THIS GAME!,"LIGHTS<CAMERA<ACTION! An AWESOME GAME! This game should becalled best game EVER made. 10 out of 10 in graphics, 10 in sound, 10in gameplay, 10 in storyline. This game also has 5 star Controls, and great Characters! The characters are: Qui-Gon-Jinn,Obi-Wan-Kenobi, Queen Amidala, and, Captain Panaka. I think the Jedi are the best, because they use LIGHTSABERS! But anyway,BUY THIS GAME!"
4,Very very good!!,"This is a very good game in a way that when you has seen the film you just have to get as the play is just so like the film. The game play is very like the film in many ways as if you split up the film in to sections then this game has a level in each piece of the film. You can even follow the story while playing it. So you don't have to have seen the film to appreciate this game but it will help as you will know what is happening throughout. It is quite a hard game to get used to but once you do, it becomes really good from there on and you can't get off of it as it is very addictive as you want to get to the next section of the film. The good thing is that it is not only just an action game like you would think but also very much a strategy one having to figure out where to go next. And to top it off you even play as queen amidala in one level! If you love the film like i do then you will love this!!"
3,"It was ok in some parts, others better, but some bad","The game was ok, but in some parts it was to challengeing and others just to easy.When you are a jedi there should be more things to do besides swing a light saber. The force rarely does any good. The force push only knocks down little enemies and the mind trick dosent even work a lot of the time.There are to many unimportant parts that make no diffrance in the game. It needs to stay closer to the movie."
5,This Is The force,This is the best game ever yo must get it.I got a demo of it and decided it was cool just from the firt level so i bought it and it i my favorite game.People say it sometimes is bouring on Tatooine but its fun wondering around and buying parts.you have great players to choose from like all of the charicter from the movie and you play the whole movie just like the movie and theres more part then the movie.I think every one should buy this game.Even if youer not into StarWars.
5,a classic star wars game to a classic star wars film,star wars episode I the phantom menace is a awesome movie a classic the best of the best the greatest movie in the world george lucas is a god the greatest film director in the world and the phantom menace video game is just as good buy this game if your a huge star wars fan you wont be sorry
2,fair-de-middle-in,"It's a game. But the acting is no worse than the movie so I give it one extra star because you can do stuff, not just sit there and watch the lousey acting. ""Qui gon, I have a bad feeling about dis"" Well, it's kinda fun, I guess. You get to whack things with yer light-saber which sounds much like the movie and the other sound effects/background ambience are excellent in my opinion. Music even better. Gameplay OK. Graphics are not the best for now but very good for 1999. You want a good Episode I game, try Racer."
2,i love star wars,"I'm a huge star wars fan, but even I found this game to be a dissapointment. The Graphics and sound are well done, but the game has caused me more frustration than enjoyment due to poorly implemented controls and camera angles. If you're looking for pretty graphics (and star wars, of course) then buy this title, but don't expect to get very far without hours of frustrating game time."
4,Hooray For Crayons!!!!,"As a avid reader of King and True crime I was quite impressed with the first time Horror writings of Mark V. The art was very original,And not all writers can be as talented to be able to write a book,and illistrate at the same time.The story lines from the Residence were quite refreshing because it wasn't something I have read or seen a millon times before.To those who have such a narrow point of view of this book try going out in the world and get a real life, or let's see you try to articulate something worth reading...It's alot harder than it seems.A note for the Author keep on writing with those Crayons if the writing biz doesn't work out you should try to get an endorsment from Crayola for making your first book possible..."
5,Best Lullaby CD ever...,"I have had all three of these CD's since before my first child was born 7 years ago. I listened to them during pregnancy (and still do occasionally to calm myself after a stressful day.) My children go to sleep every night to these beautiful sounds. From a ""production"" standpoint, there is no break in sound between the tracks on the CD, so it has a continuous peaceful sound. I love the fact that my children are getting to hear hymns as they are resting. We don't sing hymns in church like we used to and this is a way that they are getting to hear them more. I cannot recommend these CDs enough!"
5,TENOR SAX BOOK=A MUST FOR ALL,"If you play tenor sax and study jazz get this book. Do not waste any time on any other book. These transcriptions are perfect.The Colotrane solo is a gold mine of ideas and perfect. I thnk I learned more about Lester Young as well. I know the author played and was a student of Sal Nistico and that is very cool.My teacher in New Orleans uses this book as a text for his sax students. He also sais Price is one of the baddest players out there. That must besome value because this teacher taught Harrison and Bran through others.I'd hope I give you a hard core idea that this book is your next step. Any player without it is cutting short the growth.More books from Tim, somebody publish him more. I love his work! By the way what a fantastic player and nice friendly dude.One of the most creative sax players in my opinion on the jazz turf. Or rock or funk turf too. He plays it all and does it up cool."
5,Great Tenor Sax Solos Review,"Where else can you get this information and such excellent clarity. I found these solos to be perfect. Plus, i learned a lot about some players i never knew. Such as Wardell Grey and Sal Nistico. I really loved the Prez Solos and the Stan Getz Solos. The guy who made me aware of this book is the great ""Sax Repair Man"" Emilio from Boston. He told me this book is the best...and it is. He also spoke highly of the author, Tim Price, as he has known him all his life. He mentioned that everyone that comes into the store buys this book, and if i didnt believe him to stand there a while and watch it sell. This book was such a help to me i hope some day maybe to study with Tim Price. I also reccomend his Hot Rock Sax Book very highly."
5,good product,good product. I use it to hold my iPad holder on my mic stand. Does the job. the only thing I dislike about the product is the fighting screw. it would be nice if it had a washer or something on the end instead of digging into the mic stand... still no big deal.
4,You can actually win at slots,"The truth is that you can only win at the slots dictated byMr. Lund. There are no other strategies for non-banking slot machines because they are unbeatable. Lund actually gives the player at certain types of slot machines if you play by the rules given. Apparently having to ""think about it"" is too much for the reviewer below me, but personally I am excited at the opportuntiy to play slots that can be beaten.On the negative side, Lund doesn't do a great job of explaining his methods, and although I know that his analysis of machines accurately predicts the ones that can be beaten, he needs to do more research to get a greater exactitude. The good news is that he frequently publishes a supplement to this book in order to keep it up to date."
5,Crossing the Border,"This is a beautiful narrative that crosses the boundaries of culture, class and gender to let the reader see life through the eyes of an uneducated Mexican woman. The authors tells the extraordinary story of Esperansa's life and the friendship she developed with her. (The author is a professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan).In spite of the authors background, the style is rich and unique. The book would be easy read and very entertaining for people able to appreciate women's perceptions and spirituality in unprejudiced manner. I have very different backgound from both the writer and the main character and yet could relate to the story and the experience. It made me re-think my own cross cultural experiences and identity of a woman."
2,Whatever.....,"I was looking forward to reading this book after hearing so much about it from my colleagues. While it was an interesting approach to the subject matter (especially in what i assume is suppose to be an academic book), both Behar and the book get tedious.Although I appreciate Behar's efforts to relate her life to Esperanza's, somehow the book ends us being about ""me, me, me."" She just goes on and on about how horrible Esperanza's life is, and how her life is very similar to it. It comes off as a bit of a stretch, especially since Behar is benefitting by writing about the struggles of this woman's life. The book is self-centered in a very subtle way. But, by the end of the book, I just didn't care anymore about what happened to Esperanze, Behar or the book.There are both a lot of critics and advocates of this book. I wasn't able to for an opinion strong enough to join any of those two camps."
1,Something Fishy.,I'm always looking for new fun fitness dvd's. When I saw this new DVD I wanted to check it out. Every reviewer has such great things to say I wanted to see what their other reviews were like. Not one had any other review other than this DVD. This just doesn't seem right. I guess I won't be ordering this DVD until I see some real reviews.
5,Amazing!!!,This video is the hardest workout video I've ever done. It is the best total body workout possible. You will burn a ton of calories and sculpt muscles you didn't even know you had. All in an hour!!!! Awesome!!! Thank you Fusion Fitness!!!!
1,:-(,"I loved the lamp, but the glass was broken upon arrival. I am still looking for replacement glass dome so I can install it. I don't know how to go about an exchange with amazon."
2,Can't Keep a Good Man Down,"is why I bought the CD - I was hopeful that there would be more to love (Shane & Shane's Clean is one hit after another, but I digress). This is not a CD to sing to - it's definitely background music - nothing stands out but it's not bad music but just not outstanding."
2,Seems great at first...,"A Net of Fireflies is a disappointment to anyone looking for a great compilation of the best Haiku. Beautifully bound and decorated, including many wonderful full-color paintings that bring the haiku to life, the appeal of this book comes to a screeching halt after reading only one or two pages. Originally written by Japanese masters, Harold Stewart's translation of these poems turns almost EVERY ONE into something resembling a cutsie-poo children's rhyme. Two brief, rhyming lines--many with exclamation points!! You can never shake the feeling that you're not reading haiku, just some Englishman's lame poems. If you're expecting quiet dignity, subtle playfulness, or the elightened rhythm of direct translation, this is not the book for you."
1,The beauty of haiku utterly lost in translation,"When I finally got my hands on this book I could hardly wait to open it. When I did open it, it was like biting into a rotten apple. The ""translations"" turned these beautiful poetic gems into cute little rhymes. The haiku paintings are quite lovely but the book is a tragic misunderstanding of haiku poetry. Please do yourself a favor and buy a copy of Issa's ""The Spring Of My Life & Selected Haiku"" translated by Sam Hamill."
5,A net of fireflies,I just got my hand on a 1st edition copy thats has never been read and its still n its hard case its beautiful book.... Im going to find a plastic cover for it .....
1,Don't waste your money,"Let me preface by saying that I really like most of Halpern's music, however, this CD hit way below my expectations. It is a chanting CD without any musical ambiance, and with one 10 minute track of meditation that is ""silent meditation"", literally. I could've gotten my friends to chant with me while I recorded in the Great Pyramid, or anywhere acoustic for that matter and then added 10 minutes of silence and ended the CD with another chant. I really feel Halpern missed a grand opportunity to do some amazing stuff while in the Great Pyramid, yet he chose to chant, chant, chant. Why, only he can answer that one. I bought this CD before any 30 second bites were available to listen to, otherwise, I would have never bought this CD."
5,The real thing,The was issued as a record in the 80s and someone taped it for me way back then. No matter how off track my life was listening to this always helped me find a calm place and sleep well. Good to find this again I've been looking for quite a while. Give it time and it may do more for you than the more 'musical' ambient options.
2,only written for the american market,"I'm an european reader. Faiths' book is totally not adapted to the european market. I bought this book, because I thought I would learn something from this book. Caracterised for this book is the bluffing about Faith's company. 90% is only bluffing. I take my head off for what she realised in her life, but her book would better carry the name:""The incredible success of Brainreserve"". Also, this book is NOT adapted to the european market. Notes and feagures for the USA cannot be compared with those in Europe. I propose Faith to write a new book, without writing about here company, adapted to the european market and more informational. Nice greetings stephen"
3,Education recommendended for our day,I really liked this book. It made you think about what would be the best way to set up a school really interested in helping studends learn. I was a little confused for a while that it was non-fiction but now know that it is fiction. Interesting way to use fiction to express ideas on education.
5,"A ""Must Read"" for every American","In his book, Gen. Bunting outlines the requirements of a New American College. But the ideas are not ""new""; they are the very ideas upon which our Great Nation was founded. These are the ideas and values to which our Founding Fathers committed their very lives. The ideas that are presented for the college go much further, though. They speak to the manner in which responsible citizens should participate in life. Gen. Bunting asserts that our patriotism, our religious beliefs, and our personal, professional, and public conduct should all be woven into the the fabric of life, inseparable from each other. The book challenges us, as Americans, to be more than doctors, mechanics, pilots, clerks, and salesmen. As Americans, we are to take an active role in the future of our Nation.This book should be required reading of all high school seniors and certainly of all people of voting age. My hat is off to Gen. Bunting."
1,Wisconsin Cheeseman sharp cheddar crock,I didn't like it because it didn't tast right to me. I don't know if it was a preservative that gave it the taste but I didn't like it.
2,Very Low Resolution,"I don't know what they did to the video. The effective resolution is no better than 160x100. The dancing is on par with other POB performances but the video transfer failed to show that.The video is watchable on my computer in a small window. Watching it on a modern HDTV would make you wonder if your TV is broken! The dancers are great but you can't see them clearly to fully enjoy the program.I guess the advance of the modern TV has made the older videos like this one unwatchable. Very sad.Performance : 4Video Quality: 1I rented this DVD from Netflix. I would not want to own it. Owning this Blu-ray disc,Tchaikovsky: Swan Lake [Blu-ray], forever changed my expectation on what a good video can be. Sadly, this disc is far from it."
2,excpected more,I have many ballet performances in my collection. Mostly Russian ballet. Quality of this film is poor .I expected more colors -better stage design. Why dancers perform classical pieces in modern or may rehearsal type of costumes? I couldn't even finish watching it. Cover photo on DVD box is too promising.
3,VERY GOOD DEVELOPMENT STUDY -GOOD OVER VIEW -,VERY INFORMATIVE READING WITH VALUABLE ILLUSTRATIONS TO INCLUDE MAPS OF PEOPLES AND AREAS ALSO VEGETATION ZONES = COLOR AND BLACK AND WHITE PICTURES OF HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT ITEMS USED BY VARIOUS TRIBES - THIS BOOK CONTINUES A BALANCE OF WORDS AND PICTURES TO KEEP A STRONG INTEREST THROUGH ITS PAGES - A MUST REFERENCE BOOK TO AFRICAN ART AND CULTURE LEAVING SOME OF AFRICA WITH YOU.
1,only one plastic film inside box,"it says : 3 Separate Plastic Film Sheets, 1 Roll of Tape on the webpage,it contains ONLY ONEand the box was opened when arrivejust be careful when you order!!"
1,Avoid Anything Frost King,"The tape doesn't seal well. It's hard to peel the paper off the tape, the plastic sheets don't even stick to it, and the tape barely sticks to the window frame. I had to use packing tape to keep these from peeling from the wall. I got NO seal whatsoever with Frost King. Had to use other tape all around the entire thing. This never happened w/3M.You'd be better off buying double-stick tape and rolls of plastic you can cut to size. Or just stick with 3M -- more expensive but I used that stuff for years w/out issue."
5,CSNY CD,"I already had this as it turns out, but I'm going to give it away vs return it...this is their best music at a time when they were at their best...."
3,Doesn't Flow,"The songs don't flow well. Each song sounds like it's from a different band. I know that this a greatest hits album, but the songs should have been arranged better. Quiet songs and followed by loud songs, electric by accoustic; it's just a hard album to listen to. The songs are good, but it's missing some songs that should be on there, and has some of the group's weaker songs-- ie stardust-- which is a cover of the much better Joni Mitchell version. It is nice to have ""Ohio"" and ""The cost of freedom,"" though. Overall, it's good, but it could have been better. I would have been happier if I would have bought one of their orignal albums instead."
1,Positively pointless,"This was an excuse to squeeze a few more bucks out of the fan base with a folksy cover painting by Mitchell as the only substantive addition. This is the band for whom context was everything, and taking these songs out of their sequence strips them of their emotional whallop. Skip this, You don't need it. Better you had only 1 of their truly remarkable efforts than to get saddled with something that has no meaning."
1,product not received,Unfortunately still not received my product.hopefully it will be send as soon as possible.graciously
5,Fantastic,"So Far is an amazing album. Each song is one of CSN&Y's best. I can listen through the entire album two or three times in a row and I just get *so* involved in it each time. If you don't own a lot of CSN&Y albums, you should get this one because each song is great. Starting with Deja Vu and ending in the soulful Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, you won't want to miss a note."
4,Good,This album is as expected. Gave it as a present and no complaints from my husband. The shippng was fast too.
3,A brief collection of hits: some great and one stinko!,"This CD gives a sampling of early hits from CS&N, plus some with Neil Young. The best cuts by far are ""Guinievere,"" ""Suite Judy Blue Eyes,"" and ""Helplessly Hoping."" It is unfortunately brief: less than 45 minutes in duration. Somehow, I expect more from a CD. And one unfortunate inclusion: ""Teach your children."" This one is an embarassment for its smug bathos. They were better before they became CSN&Y."
3,"Good, but get the albums.","Yes, this has Ohio and Find The Cost Of Freedom. You ever heard of downloading? Honestly, this album has about 5 or 6 songs from Deja Vu, 3 from the debut, and two new songs which total up 5 minutes. WOW! The music is quite good, but this is not essential. Maybe if you're a first time listener though."
2,"So Far, So ....Average.","A hastily compiled ""Greatest Hits"" album in the 70's, ""So Far"" seems a little in this day and age where CDs can hold 70+ minutes of music. Released after only two CSN(&Y) albums, this does not contain songs such as ""Just A Song Before I Go"", ""Wasted On The Way"", ""American Dream"", or anything released after the mid-70s, fot that matter. I agree with most of the other reviewers that the music is timeless and classic, but Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young deserve a stronger career retrospective for their thirty plus years."
4,CSNY Greatest Hits,It's a good album with the most importants jobs they've already done. Just put it on and relax!
4,So Far,This was the first CSN album I owned and it opened a door in my music library. I loved every song in this compilation and it drove me to buy more CSN albums and the box set.
5,Often overlooked masterpiece,"Put on the headphones, turn down the lights and do nothing else while listening to this maserpiece. Don't pay too much attention to the words, this album is all about the brilliant musicality. The harmonies give goose bumps, but they're never self-indulgent. This is just four master musicians who got together with a shared passion for perfection. Don't miss the impressive vocal attention to detail in ""Helplessly Hoping"". Wow. But of course the last track is the set piece. Wow again."
5,Sweet sweet Rock and Roll,"Having a mother who went to Woodstock, I was never allowed to live through the eighties in my childhood. Tracks from this album nurtured me into good musical sense. Now, in college, I find many modern ""alternative"" bands to be highly derivative of CSN&Y. ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes"" is a masterpiece which should satiate any Blind Melon fan, and ""Woodstock"" is one of the great early hard-rockin' hits that defined a generation. Here's to wishing that this age had never passed!"
4,Garmin nuvi 250W,Upon receiving the nuvi 250W it was easy to set up and install in my car. Sensitivity is very good and the unit locked on to satellites very rapidly. During a trip it locked on to satellites from my motel room while sitting at the desk several feet from the window.This unit is easy to use and does all the basic GPS mapping functions well. My only gripe is the quick start manual is very basic and I had to learn how to get the best use by experimentation. Getting to some of the more advanced setup features was not always intuitive.
4,Garmin Nuvi 250W,"I'm very happy with my Nuvi. I bought it to replace a very old NavMan loaded into my Compaq IPaq. Turn by turn directions with voice is very helpful, and bright color display is excellent. It oaccasionally takes a while to find the satellites, therefore I'm only going with 4 stars - otherwise it would be 5!"
1,Do not buy!,"Bought 2 of this and neither of them work without being plugged to the charger. As other reviewers said this gps has a defective battery, it doesn't even show the battery icon on top. It works fine when plugged."
2,Great unit...WHEN IT WORKS!,"For 18 months, I used this little gem, yes there were minor flaws, but overall, an excellent GPS. Then one day while driving it just stopped working! KAPUT! I checked Garmin's website and it costs more to get it repaired ($125 plus shipping) than to purchase a new one ($118 includes shipping). If Garmin can't back up their products better, I just assume go purchase a competitors model.Like I mentioned, the GPS is a slick little unit, but Garmin doesn't seem to care much about warranting their products."
3,Garmin Nuvi 250,I don't believe that I order this from Amazon but I use this version of GPS at my work. I trust Garmin over all other GPS in the market today. I have two Garmins that I use on a daily bases and I havn't gotten lost yet.
1,Outdated GPS maps,"This is the second Garman Nuvi I have purchased through Amazon in the past 4 months. The first one was for my own use and I have no complaints with it. This recent purchase was for a Christmas gift. I tested the unit to be sure it was operable. Much to my surprise, the unit immediately warned me the maps are over a year old and require updating. Updated maps are $69 on the Garmin site. This update will put the unit far above its worth in cost. Needless to say, I am quite disapointed in the product."
3,Garmin reliability? Remains to be seen,"Garmin nüvi 250W 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS NavigatorI think the unit that I bought has not been updated recently. I entered an address I knew to be where it was but I was directed in the opposite direction. Of course I ignored it and started driving towards the right place. Only when I was just a mile away when the unit gave the correct directions. Also, the unit did not have a new toll road in Austin, Texas, opened a year ago, in its memory.But I haven't really used it much. I intend to use it a lot more when I retire at the end of 2008. I gave it 3 stars because its reliability remains to be seen."
1,"""Used"" instead of advertised ""New""",Came in a box with no packing whatsoever. You knew instantly that this was a used item. Turned it on and there was a white spot on the screen. Used - and defective!! Sent it right on back.
3,Not quite what I thought,"When I used it to go on a long trip it took me ways that were by far not the quickest way to get to the destination. I had traveled to these place before but I followed the given directions to see where it would go. It almost seems that it has no idea of the ""good"" roads that are available to take."
2,battery issues,"I have been using a Garmin C530 for years. I decided it was time for a backup, and possibly an upgrade,..something easy to take along for a walk. I tried this GPS for a few days in my truck, and everything was fine. I left it home after that and continued to use my C530. A few months later, I decided to switch over. When power is lost, that is it, it would not continue on battery power. I read the warranty, and conveniently, the battery is not covered. There are other reviews complaining of this same issue. I read a review that said this model does not come with a battery. I opened it up, and there is indeed a battery in it, but it does not work. Good job, Garmin. Did you buy a bunch of junk batteries? I ordered a replacement battery from a seller here at Amazon, hope it is not the charging circuit. Yes, I already tried a different cord, from my 255W. I hope this is a good fix, and the 255W does not suffer the same fate."
2,Battery function unusable,"The device works fine while plugged in to power, but does not sustain a charge. I thought it might be me, so after reading the user manual and following instructions to no avail, I talked to Garmin, and did as they suggested to charge it overnight. No joy. Unit still would not turn on without external power. So, I thought, maybe it's the unit that has a problem. I returned it and had Amazon send another. Same problem, same effort to overcome, still no joy. Sent the second unit back for refund. I don't understand how this could happen. Either there is a secret about how to enable the battery, or the batteries they use are garbage. Either way, it's not good for Garmin, not good for Amazon, and not good for me. Avoid this product unless you have one in your hands that works the way it's supposed to."
1,Hate Garmin!!!,"Garmin has a policy of allowing free updates for 60 days only on this product, but there is nothing on the package to warn of this. So when I figured out that it needed updating, it was past the date. I AM REALLY MAJORLY TICKED OFF AT GARMIN! I sat on hold for 35 minutes, got cut off, sat on hold for another 15 minutes, got transferred, sat on hold for another hour and then was told there was nothing they couldn't fix it.WARNING! LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT BRAND!"
2,Slow acquiring saatellite signal & clumsy User Interface,"Takes up to 3 minutes to acquire a signal even under clear sky. Sometimes navigation locks up for no reason. I do not like the user interface because once you are deep in the menu you have to back out one step at a time. The ""STOP"" button is at the exact position of the ""BACK"" button so I sometimes end up stopping the navigation when I just hit ""BACK"" once too many. No alternative way to sort POI's and Favorites."
5,never lost again,bought a New GPS and I could not believe that I could get to point A to point B with out getting lost or stopping every other gas station for directions is an awsome little invention I never had any sense of direction maps forget about that one now with my GPS I don't need a navagator next to me in my car.I have my new Bertha that's her name so come ladies and Gents get yourself one YOU WILL JUST LOVE IT
4,it will get you there,"This is a great little device with many helping features. I don't know why I managed to get by without it. This makes traveling so much more enjoyable, knowing your not going astray. This makes for one happy trip."
4,a good basic portable GPS,I'm one of those people who doesn't need all the bells and whistles in a gadget. I also need something user friendly. This item is a good basic simple GPS that is easy to use. The only drawback: not enough information in the memory sometimes. That's what you get with the low price. My sister has an incredible built-in system (also by Garmin) in her car. It is also about six times the cost of mine. Do I want to pay that price for the additional features? No. I'm happy with my GPS.
4,Simple with frills and affordable,"I received this as a gift. So far, it works great, it is simple and to the point. I do not know why anyone would want more complicated software in it.It also has a voice, so if yours does not SPEAK, it could be faulty or defective merchandise. The only minus is that you need the additional gimmick of buying a sturdy support base, which is easy to put on the dashboard but bulky. However, for this price Gamin should at least throw the protective case for the screen. This has to be bought separate unless you spend big bucks on an advanced model."
4,Good unit,"Pros: Great picture, reception, a lot of features. Great for Geocaching.Cons: Takes a while to acquire satellite's at first."
2,defectiv e,"I BOUGHT THE GARMAN 250W FOR MY WIFE WHO IS ALWAYS GETTING LOST. I WAS SUPRISED TO GET A CALL SAYING SHE GOT LOST AND MISSED HER DR'S APPT. I FIRST THOUGHT WAS IT WAS SOMETHING SHE DID WRONG. SO I ATTACHED IT MYSELF IN HER CAR ,SET IT UP TO GO HOME. THERE WAS A DETOUR AND FROM THEN ON IT DIDN'T WORK CORECTLY, MY WIFE ENDED UP GOING IN CIRCLES AND WAS VERY UPSET. SHE NOW IS REFUSING TO LET ME REPLACE IT. I LIKE ALL THE FEATURES. IT'S VERY EASY TO SET UP, EXCEPT THIS MODEL DOESN'T CALL OUT THE STREET NAMES. THIS IS A HANDY FEATURE IF YOU HAVE TWO STREETS CLOSE TOGETHER AND ARE UNABLE TO SEE THE STREET PRINTED ON THE GPS. I DON'T KNOW HOW COMMON DEFECT ARE IN GPS UNITS, BUT I WOULD RECCOMEND THROUGHLY CHECKING IT OUT BEFORE GIVING IT TO SOMEONE WHO WHO REALLY NEEDS THE HELP."
2,Nuvi 250W takes a long time acquiring a satellite,I would not recommend the Nuvi 250W. I purchased two of these from Amazon and I have been disappointed. They take a long time to acquire a satellite signal. When I was in San Jose it took 5-10 minutes to acquire a signal. I was already to my destination by the time I got a signal. I then took it to Chicago and waited 10 minutes for the signal. I was traveling about 17 miles from O'hare airport and while on the toll road 355 the GPS showed me in the middle of a white space (no road). The GPS was totally confused and started spinning. Today in the middle of the Dallas suburbs it took 20 minutes to get a signal on a partly cloudy day. I would try a different manufacturer or a higher end model.
1,Faulty,"I purchased this product for my father along with a mount for his motorcycle. It seems to work great while its plugged in charging but as soon as you unplug it, it dies. The battery seems to be faulty and won't hold a charge. Pretty much defeats the purpose of having it on a motorcycle."
1,"Amazon, are you ripping us off?","I got an email from Amazon stating their lightning deals for gps... and that got me excited!Garmin has always been my preferred brand and I thought this unit is going to be a steal. Imagine my shock when I saw their price. $190??? Are you serious? It's a discontinued product and the newer ones with more functions are cheaper!Please shoppers, do some homework before buying stuffs even at a reputable store as Amazon!"
1,Must be plugged in,"I think it's a default, or at least I hope, but the GPS must always be plugged in, which is inconvenient. I like to start programming while walking to my car, I like to unplug and take it with me so it's not sitting in the car asking to be stolen, but now it shuts off and I have to start all over reprogramming. Don't buy this until they get that glitch fixed."
4,Wow! Technology rocks!,"This little gadget is awesome! It is very accurate, even showing streets in neighborhoods that were just recently completed.I like that you can change your ""car"" icon. My son likes the spaceship. I personally like the battle tank. Of course, my daughter like the pink car.It's very user friendly and very intuitive. It's easy to use, right out of the box, without having to read the instructions first.I recommended this to a coworker. He bought one and thanked me for steering him away from a Tom-Tom that he was looking at."
4,great little unit,The wide screen is great for easier viewing. would have liked spoken street names but that would be more expensive. this unit only speaks turn by turn directions but the price was affordable
2,Having trouble,GARMIN 010-00656-00 Nuvi 250W Widescreen Travel Assistant This was a christmas gift for my son going off to another state for college. I was very disappointed because he opened the garmin and to our disbelief it would not hold a charge. The company has had us send it back of course at our expense and is going to send a replacement. However this makes christmas for myself and son very unhappy. It costs enough to by these kinds of gifts and you expect them to work once you get them and not cost you more money to fix them when the company didn't do enough quality control to make sure it worked in the first place.
5,Critical for my survival,"I just moved to Coumbus after living in Pittsburgh my entire life, and without this Garmin, I would be lost everyday. It's easy to use and gives almost perfect directions anywhere. I'm also a fan of the wide-screen. I did a lot of searching for the right GPS system before I bought this one, and I think I made the right decision."
4,"Suction cup works! Good price for a 4.3"" widescreen but less options","Pro: Unlike the older and more expensive models, the suction cup stays on the windshield and is easy to remove and attach. There is no antena to flip or pull. The plug for connecting the unit to the cigarette lighter is small. You can make the connection while the unit is mounted on the winshield. I am happy with the product in general, especially the screen size and the price.Con: There are only two options for avoidance, and it won't let you avoid traffic or highway. You have to look at the display to know toward what street it is guiding you. The audio only tells you to turn or stay on left/right in certain number of miles/feet. If this is not the first GPS you use, you may need to get used to the fact that the distance info and the turn icon are on the uppper left corner on this model."
4,VERY GOOD GPS FOR PRICE,"Purchased for out of state trip and found Garmin unit to be very good indirecting you to proper exits. Retrospect wished had purchased unit that call out street names, but this unit was not confusing. Excellent value at under $200 for a basic large screen unit that is easy to use."
4,Garmin is the best,I have used several GPS products from other manufacturers and Garmin makes the best. This unit did not let me down. It is very easy to use and has a great display. Great GPS for the money!!
3,Great when it works,"The Garmin 250W works great when there is good satellite link, but connectivity is inconsistent and easily affected by clouds, the weather, trees, etc. Basically it might fail to work when you need it the most."
3,250w,"A bit pricy but excellent piece of electronic. Good support from Garmin but website can be confusing, if you have questions call them."
1,Surprised,"I bought this GPS for my second car. For my other car we bought the TomTom. We got a great deal on this model and thought that Garmin had a great name in GPS and decided to take a chance. Bad Choice - I was very surprised at the inaccuracy of the Garmin compared to TomTom.If I was going to the same place 5 times, I would get 5 different directions. After 1 month of getting lost and frustrated, I returned this item and went back to TomTom. I have to say I was very surprised with Garmin and Disappointed.Positives -Great window suction mountaverage battery lifeease of useSize of unitLarge ScreenNegativesAccuracy of directionsscreen does not keep up with driving - Many times screen would fall behind where I was on screen causing me to miss turnsHope this review is helpful! You need to decide what is most important to you when buying a GPS"
2,My GPS is trying to kill me.,"I bought this when I moved to San Francisco 3 weeks ago, and at least for SF the Garmin is more than a little buggy. Since SF has several overpasses and freeways over streets, the Garmin has trouble when I go up an on-ramp and often glitches, suddenly thinking I'm on the road below. Once when crossing the Bay Bridge it suddenly thought I'd leapt off the road and headed over water, spinning in slow circles ... a situation it didn't correct until I was well into Oakland.I know that satellite technology isn't perfect, and it does a good job for what it is, but I'd at least expect the Garmin maps to know the difference between a one-way street and a two-way. Far too many times it plans routes that are either impossible or dangerous. Add to that the fact I've done store searches, selected the store I want to go to, and followed the direct route as instructed by the Garmin only to end up in an industrial park with no stores in sight. They really need to update their maps."
3,"Nice unit, but not worth these prices","I've had good luck with Garmin units, just bought a 265T to replace a 275T stolen from the car.The problem with the 250W is that it should be an $80 unit in today's market, Amazon has a regular price of $200 on it. Why not buy a 255W, or 265W instead, probably adding traffic (255WT or 265WT). Much better deal currently."
2,extremely slow satellite,"I owned this product for 6 months and although it usually got me from point A to point B it took forever to get satellite reception, which means you are either driving around lost or have to sit in your car for 5-10 minutes until you get a signal for it to calculate the route. After awhile my receiver stopped holding its charge so I had to constantly keep it plugged in, and my letters doubled on on ""D"" so I could not type in the letter ""T"". I exchanged it for the Magellan 1420 and it was MUCH faster, routed my drive immediately, and gave me more routing options such as fewer freeways, and more points of interest."
2,Very Slow Connection,this product takes forever to connect to a satellite. I am thinking of returning it. It is very unpredictable and if you are in a hurry forget about using it at all.
3,Garmin nüvi 250W vs. Street Pilot III,"As a return customer from Garmin Street Pilot III. I found the new unit has several things that are hard for me.1. It needs very long time to register sat.2. Less accurate and slower response3. Assume you always are on the route it plotted. Even if you have already deviated from its plotted route, the GPS still shows you are on the plotted route. Eventually it will finally realize you are at somewhere else and perform route recalculation4.Software not as robust as the old unit. It went completely hay wire on my several times. Only way to get it back is to reboot the unit5. No indoor charger. Sold as a $25 option.Not a bad unit for what it cost. Just thought that the software could be a little better"
2,I Have Mixed Feelings About Tori's Second Outing,"Tori's ""Under The Pink"" is marginal and strange. The concept of her songs are just not understandable, and I guess you're not supposed to understand it at all. Tori wails on ""God"", the blasphemous single that turn some listeners away, and tragically ruins the record and ones to come. ""Pretty Good Year"" stands out as a great song and so does ""Bells For Her."" Other than that, I am disappointed."
2,Not up to snuff,"I wish this were as good as ""Little Earthquakes"" but it doesnt come close. The melodies are flat, the production slick. I'm beginning to think she's a One-Trick-Pony."
1,Not even close to Little Earthquakes,"Except for a couple of tracks, I find this album immensely boring, almost unlistenable. I can't believe the same person that did Little Earthquakes put out this garbage. It is one of the few CDs in my collection that I will someday trade in for something else. Sure, her fans love it, but to everyone else...BUYER BEWARE!"
1,the worst album ever,"Where to start. This is the worst album I've ever heard -over indulgent vocals blend jarringly with meandering and ridiculously dynamic piano parts to create the kind of music that is sure to put me in a bad mood no matter how good I was feeling previously. I acknowledge that people have different musical tastes, but it is too far beyond me for me to understand how anyone could even be indifferent to this 'music' let alone like it enough to buy it. It's just plain rubbish."
2,Eeeek!,"Does Tori Amos have an appealing voice? Certainly. Is the music good? Of course! Then why are you giving it 2 stars? The track, ""GOD"" is offensive. So are what I feel to be other references to God and Christians which express negative feelings towards them."
5,"Rabbits, Greg, and pumpkin PJ's.","Amos's sophomore effort did not disappoint. The songs were more complex, both musically and lyrically. Subjects ranged from the cruelty of women toward one another to masterbation in the church. The album is rich with metaphors and stunning piano-based arrangements. ""Cornflake Girl"" garnered the ""girl and the piano"" some long-overdue attention. And as the world would find out soon enough, Amos was just getting started. Highlights include ""God,"" ""Past the Mission,"" ""Cornflake Girl,"" and ""Yes, Anastasia."""
5,I treasure this one,"Get this album, then listen over and over again to Bells for Her, Icicle, and Yes Anastasia. Cornflake Girl is not the only good song here. Tori, you rule!!David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
5,My Favorite Tori CD,"This is my favorite Tori cd and the one that made me a fan. I had heard a little about her and decided to get the cd when I couldn't decide on another free cd when joining a cd club. I was instantly hooked. I thought it was a little weird at first, but Tori has become one of my favorite musicians. The piano in her music is awesome and her lyrics are something I find enjoyable to listen to and to read just as I do poetry. Another reviewer described Tori perfectly when he suggested that she is either a genious, insane, or both. This cd is perfect."
5,Edgy Expressive Eloquence,"Never have I really experienced in a long span of time music brimming with enticing instrument unison with pop theatrics. Under The Pink is riveting! Tori's nervy chilly voice possesses an extraordinary vintage. Her almost lulling but powerful voice and lyrics stay in your mind as if speaking to you like that kept second voice in your subconscious. Right after listening to my copy I felt entirely enveloped by her profound metaphorical world and musical concept. Her piano touches soft, sharp and hard create melodies as if looking for stage play scenes to accompany. Pretty Good Year is tinged with dour sensitivity, that brings to mind a forlorn lass at once reminiscing and reflecting one unforgettable awakening. Here is a musical genius whose distinctive music writing and singing will become an icon of emotional psychedelia."
5,this album is incredible,"Tori Amos is one of the best performers there is in the industry. This album is has a perfect blend of soft and hard music. The emotion, the piano, Tori's voice, and the lyrics that have been shed by the soul of Tori Amos. These all combine into one sensational recording."
3,"Good for Tori fans, otherwise merely average","This album is a scattered bunch, never really coming to a point and going in some experimental directions that were perhaps best left alone. It has a few good tracks, but they never quite outweigh the average ones."
3,Strained greatness,"3 1/2Amos's exponentially experimental follow-up to an extremely solid starting point did feel a bit over-thought in spots, consciously trying to evade any ""solo singer/songwriter"" box she seemingly perceived. But often this extra instrumentation complimented in ways that expanded rather than detracted."
3,"I love Tori, but not this album","I'm sure I will anger a lot of the hardcore Tori fans with what I will say here, and that's fine with me. ...I really don't know why this album was released, it is hands down the weakest Tori album. There are, however, two fabulous songs on the album: ""Past the Mission"" and ""Cornflake Girl"". The rest of the songs are just filler (with a few very minor exceptions) and this album can not be played all the way through as a whole and enjoyed, at least not for me. I will be hitting the track forward button constantly while listening to this album. This is really the only album of hers that I can not just press play and walk away until it's through. Sorry!"
3,pretty good,i really liked the God song.i think she has talent.she has a certain style about her Writting&piano playing.this album was pretty good.her voice is hit&miss at times but i respect her overall talent.
3,A quiet sophomore beauty,"yes, I'll admit i was more than a bit disappointed that this umpteenth album i don't own slipped much more slowly into the drama than did Tori's first effort Little Earthquakes, therefore making it a success...but if one does appreciate the placid experimental themes of most tracks this album shouldn't be one to disappoint, so give it a try i suppose. ""god"" and ""the wrong band"" were considerable high notes..."
2,?,"I really loved Little Earthquakes, I was weirded out (and a little scared) by Boys for Pele, and I respected and enjoyed Choirgirl Hotel. But I just didn't get this album. Most of it, anyway. Cornflake is incredible and Baker is beautiful and there are a few other good tracks, but mostly this album is beyond me."
2,Boring,"The much ballyhooed Tori Amos dishes out another set of pretentious, cloying songs. Except for the coyly blasphemous single, ""God,"" and the shuffling beat in the otherwise awkward ""Cornflake Girl,"" none of these songs have any appeal. If Amos is at the forefront of the new singer-songwriter movement, bring back Carole King."
3,Cornflake girl,"Compared to Tori's Little Earthquakes album this is not as moving or haunting. It's more alternative and light hearted. I admire her for trying something unique but some of the tracks just don't work. Cloud On My Tongue, Space Dog, Yes Anastasia and Past The Mission could have been better. Some of the songs that are worth listening to are Waitress, Baker,Baker, Cornflake Girl,(terrific piano playing) and GOD the best song on the album. Not her best effort."
5,NoTORIous,"I saw Tori Amos's ""God"" video randomly on MTV when I was 14. I could not believe how amazing she was. I bought the CD and listened to it over and over again. There was a guy I liked and I played the CD for him. He asked me ""what that crap was""? Two years later he was dating a hippie chick and during a conversation at lunch he asked me if I'd ever heard of Tori Amos. That's when I first realized that he was definitely not for me.Under the Pink laid the background for my future revolution. I could sing every line of every song. ""Bells for Her"" is about blanket friends. ""Cornflake Girl"" is about never being a cornflake girl. What's a Cornflake Girl? You decide. In ""God,"" Tori asks God whether he needs a woman to look after him. ""The Waitress"" is about wanting to kill a co-worker. I'm sure you've been in a similar situation. While Tori has put out several more CDs, but in my opinion, this is her best work."
5,Cornflake Girl,"Tori creates a chilling landscape of insidiously soft bells and sweeping strings, wailing of subjects as diverse as rape, God, failed relationships.... and that's only the tip of the iceberg. The songs themselves can be as introspective and thoughtful as they are disturbing, masked by cryptic lyrics and Tori's undeniable quirkiness. I especially enjoyed her dueting with Trent Reznor, that was an unexpected suprise, since he rarely collaborates with other artists. Some of my other favorites are Cornflake Girl, God, Pretty good year, and The waitress. Killing a waitress....Tee hee. Watch your backs, all you McDonald employees! One of her best efforts."
5,"Outstanding, passionate & original music by Tori Amos.","Best of her albums so far, deep rhythmic backgrounds against a delicate Bosendorfer piano and tori's expressive voice combine to make a unique listening experience. It's the kind of music that will definately take you to another place. Tori's 'Cornflake girl' shows her unique vocal characteristics. This album has a way of getting under your skin, these songs stay with you. 'Space Dog' is the most interesting song I've heard with the strangest lyrics. Her songs are a great mystery. 'Waitress' is a wild song expressing the inner conflict of hate and reason. Tori will take you on a musical trip through her Looking Glass, you might not understand the lyrics, but you will enjoy the music."
4,Pinking into the coming storm,"It's amazing to consider the fact that this is what preceded Boys for Pele, but if one takes the time to listen to the b-sides associated with it, the chronology no longer seems so surprising. This and BFP are very special to me, but you should round out (both) with some non-album tracks, like Honey, Sister Janet, the piano suite, Alamo, stuff like that."
4,Tori's Great Sophomore Effort,"If you were to assemble a 'greatest hits' collection for Tori Amos. The majority of those songs would come from her second Lp Under The Pink. It contains the fan favorites like ""Cornflake Girl"", ""Pretty Good Year"", ""God"", and ""The Waitress"". However, this album can be referred to as Tori 'on the lighter side'... there is much more piano than guitar. Granted, Amos is a talented pianist and vocalist, but a music buyer enjoys a bit of variety in an album. All in all, this is as good as a sophomore album that Amos could hope for. But it may have left her audience hoping for something a little bit more."
4,Magical moments...,"The lyrically daunting follow-up to Little Earthquakes reveals itself slowly and then sticks in your head for years.UTP is a more complex record, both lyrically and musically. The beats of God and the angry snarl of The Waitress are still off-putting and the album scores higher marks when Tori sticks to the ballads.UTP features some of Tori's best work - Baker Baker and Bells For Her are exquisite, while Space Dog meanders along before falling into a near-perfect chorus. But it's the frank humour of Icicle and the magical Cloud On My Tongue that really make Pink an essential purchase. These two songs say more about Tori than anything recently and they remain firm fan favourites. Highly recommended."
5,Elclectic and energizing,"Perhaps because I've grown into being a fan of Tori Amos, or simply have a taste for complex musical poetry, this collection meets all my (high) standards of what poetry should be when woven with innovative music. Amos is a composer and strong poetic force who feels what she creates.I recommend that you listen and share her feelings, blending them with your own."
5,Under the Pink,"I love this CD, and of course my favorite is Cornflake Girls. My girls and I use to jam to that song frequently and it remains a favorite after all these years. Great listening!"
5,The Best Tori Album,"If you have to purchase any Tori Album, get ""Under the Pink"". It has a better variety of songs than on ""Little Earthquakes"" and is not as whiney (and bad) as ""Boys for Pele"". People tend to favor ""Little Earthquakes"" over this album and I don't know why. On ""Under the Pink"", the songs are catchier, more mature, and many songs can fall into the ""alternative"" genre. Songs range from the slow tempo of her piano and the strings in ""Baker, Baker"" to the guitar-screeching noises and piano-banging of ""God"". I have almost every Tori album/single/E.P. that was ever made in the U.S. and I can tell that this is an album that you will not leave alone. If you don't like this album, than you have bad taste in music, because this album has something for everybody and has some of the best lyrics that you'll ever find. Tori is one of the greatest female artists around, and this is her best album. What more can you want?"
4,Pretty Good Year...for Tori's _Under the Pink_.,"Tori Amos' second album shows she's not one to rest on her laurels. She explores new musical ground, and the melodies and arrangements are more complex than those of _Little Earthquakes_. Songs such as _Pretty Good Year_ displays complex musical struture. Tori fearlessly breaks from muscial tradition and provides an ever shifting musical terrain for us to experience. In _God_, she even dares to question if God needs a woman to look after him. This album is great, but lacks the emotional intimacy and candor of _Little Earthquakes_. _Under the Pink_ is another masterpiece by Tori Amos."
3,Dry Though Useful Close Comparison of Several Icelandic Sources,"I ordered this 80-page pamphlet to assist me in researching my book on geographical fantasies, Sailing the Sea of Dreams. The lore of pre-Columbian contact between Europe and America is part of this parade of illusions and garbled accounts of likely real voyages. The author has decided to compare the several different Icelandic saga manuscripts and versions side-by-side and note discrepancies (explained away) and similarities ( affirmed). He tries to square the accounts to find out what really may have happened---who, where, when, and why. However the method is rather dry, reading like a doctoral research paper rather than lively history."
3,Ok,"Fairly remedial information. There were a few gems, but they were hidden. If you are new to inside sales management, this would be a great buy."
4,interesting,"the vampyre was somewhat slow. a little confusing if you compare a vampyre of the 1800's to a vampire of today. i like many of the vampyre's more cursed aspects such as; when he gambled he would mysteriously always win all the money of someone who desperately needed money, and rendering young girls of good family worthless. but, regenerating in the moonlight was something that needed explanation as well as not needing to drink blood-he seemed to drink life instead-. with the exception of the moonlight issue, i think i like the old vampyre's character."
1,Not Worth It,"This product did NOT satisfy my expectations. I ended up returning it. Granted it's only $..., I don't think it's worth the money you pay for it.I ordered this poster hoping it would resemble the one shown in the tiny product picture. It didn't however look anything like that. It wasted a lot of empty space on the poster, where they could have printed more detailed information on the classes illustrated. Java Report (online magazine) has a nice interactive poster that is better than this one. I'd advise anyone wanting this to print out some pages from that site, or create a poster that looks like what you need - with the classes and necessary methods. This poster only depicts the classes and has very little other useful information.Good Luck!"
2,Records audio fine,This camera records audio fine but as for video....it's terrible. Any movement at all produces huge blurs leaving my entire 32 minute video I made completely incomprehensible besides the audio. There are many many other choices for a video camera and I urge you to choose any of them in the place of this one.
3,its ok for the price,this is the first digital camcorder i've had but i expected it to have a little better resolution. i have an older vhs-c camcorder and it takes clearer video than this. i really don't think it is 6 mega pixels though. my regular digital camera is 4 mp and takes a lot clearer picture. overall it's ok for the price. i plan on using it to take quick video clips of my kids and i think it will work for that.
1,Camcorder wouldn't charge,I bought the camcorder for my grandson as a Christmas present. He didn't get a chance to use it because the battery wouldn't charge. It was returned in exchange for a gift card.
2,For Still Life only (or web-cast),"This is a great camcorder if you are filming sloths with a tripod. If anything moves, it blurs. The video is noticeably choppy, the stills are blurry. The sound is questionable. You can't fill up a 1 GB memory card on one set of batteries (about 40 minutes). From the time you hit the button to take a picture until it actually takes it is at least 3 seconds. It does not remember settings from power off to power on, I had to set the flash to auto repeatedly.It is small, it is light, it will fit in you pocket. It is actually quite amazing for so small a device.If you are filming for your website, this is cost effective, buy rechargeable batteries. If you are filming for posterity or a DVD to give grandma, don't bother."
3,Okay camera for kids,"I bought this video camera for my 12-year-old son who enjoys recording moments and events with his friends. It does not provide the best quality and since I purchased it a week ago, he has had to change the AA batteries three times.This camera is okay for the price, but I would not recommend this camera if you wanted to record high quality material."
3,Camcorder,"Easy to use -- lightweight -- nice for someone just starting out -- the picture seems very nice too -- even my husband the ""camera enthusist"" was impressed with the quality of the picture."
2,Broke within the first week,"I had this model before and it lasted about 3 years. I was happy with it and the price was right, so I found another one. Unfortunately this one stopped working after just a few days. Very disappointing."
3,"Quite different from ""Big Ones""","Made in EU in 2000, Serial# 497-441-2, Playing Time: 76 min.A collection of 18 tracks lifted from the ""Done With Mirrors"" up to ""Get A Grip"" albums. Because this is the first review, I'm sending the full track listing separately.Unlike ""Big Ones"", the record company decided this time to include tracks from DWM (6 tracks!). Furthermore, the rest of the track selection is quite different from ""Big Ones"", and in my opinion, somewhat weaker. I'm surprised but mostly disappointed that songs like ""Love In An Elevator"", ""Dude"", and ""Livin' On The Edge"" are absent from this latest collection.Overall, ""Big Ones"" has more chances of getting in my CD player than this inferior compilation..."
1,Every song is a HIT!!!,"Every album is a must have for any Aerosmith fan. For those who ""Boo"" this album for not having Dude(lookes like a lady) is lame. There is more to Aersomith than that one song. I like the classics. I wish they would have a album that has songs that have not been on a greatest hit album. Dust off some of the older songs and make them new again."
4,Good practice,"This book will give you plenty of practice before the actual registration exam. It gives you an idea on what kind of questions will be asked, and helps you to find what areas you need to focus your studies."
4,"These Wild Orchids have color,artistic and are in a class by itself","Steve Hackett's lastest is a classic example of true craftmanship.What I found to be humorous is the little comments after the listing of each song.Anyway tracks like Waters of the Wild,Set your Compass start the album of innocently enough then the journey begins!The song Down Street has a kind of Tubes Wild Women Of Wongo feel with Tom Waits sining. Man In The Long Black Coat is excellent.Steve's guitar cuts through like a hot knife in butter.The rest of the album cruises along until the last track Until The Last Butterfly winds down,leaving the listener grateful on the purchase.Personally I could have stayed and listened to 17 more."
4,Rise Again,Steve Hackett is one of the most talented and underated guitarist living today. Wild Orchids presents Steve at his versitle best. This disc is a typical Hackett effort in that it presents a broad pallet of musical taste. The musical spectrum is touched with delicate accoustic sounds and paint peeling screaming electronic solos. My own personal favorites are Howl which is very reminisent of Jeff Becks Guitar Shop and the very meloncoly Cedars of Lebonan which is about as political as Steve will get.Steve should depend less on the Count Dracula vocal effects and just consider straight up instrumental when necessary. I would like to see Steve tour the US on a more consistent basis and create more jazz focused tunes to take advantage of his own skills and showcase his excellent SAX player (Rob Townshend) as he did on his last electric tour.
4,NICE....,"FOR SOME REASON, THERE WERE NO REVEIWS ON THIS ITEM ANYWHERE, & I COULDN'T FIND OUT ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I WANTED TO POSSIBLY PURCHASE IT BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER THAN ALL THE OTHERS, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS ""CRAP"" OR NOT. I WENT OUT ON A LIMB & BOUGHT THE SYSTEM, & EVEN THOUGH I'VE ONLY HAD IT A COUPLE OF DAYS, I LOVE IT! IT'S NOT BULKY (KIND OF SMALL ACTUALLY) WHICH IS NICE, THE STROLLER GLIDES REAL SMOOTH & MANUVERS EASILY, THE COLOR IS NICE (TAN, GREEN, & SILVER), THE STROLLER IS EASY TO FOLD DOWN, ....OF COURSE I'M STILL LEARNING STUFF ABOUT IT, BUT SO FAR THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT THE RELEASE TO GET THE CAR SEAT OUT OF THE BASE IS IN THE FRONT WHICH IS HARD TO REACH IF YOU HAVE YOUR CHILD IN THE BACK SEAT FACING THE REAR LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO. I LOVE THE ADJUSTABLE HEAD REST THING -YOU JUST TURN A DIAL (IT'S SO COOL). OVERALL, SO FAR SO GOOD! I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE! I THINK IT'S A GREAT SYSTEM SO FAR!"
3,Cheap Price and Construction.,"Assembly was very easy, however ALL of the wheel locks BROKE when I tried to install them.The stroller seat only adjusts to two positions, does not appear to be very sturdy, and the canopy has alot of gaps where it meets the back.There are alot of exposed pieces of sharp plastic where little fingers can get cut.The footrest will not snap into place.The Carseat does have a really convenient triangle handle that doesn't require you to painfully twist your wrist to carry it.The Carseat canopy is really cheesy.I kick the bottom with every single step I take. (I'm 5'10) If you are tall or have a long stride this may not be the stroller for you.I would not recommend this travel system. It may be a good price, but is not of outstanding quality."
4,"This is great for a quick, fun read!!!!","This novel is short but action-packed and well worth the 13 bucks! I didn't want to put it down. The characters are very unique and interesting, and the story is thought-provoking. I you're looking for something fun to read, go for it!!"
4,Superb Collection !,"One could never stop listening to Jim Reeves. This collection should be classified as a True Collectors' Item. It has been over 36 years since he passed away in July 1964, yet his songs have become true legends and classics in their own right. No matter how many CDs are manufactured with varied tracks, Jim Reeves will always be a favourite. I think the USPS ought to honour this great Gentleman of Country Music with an appropriate postage stamp, like other country music greats have been honoured."
1,Print is MICROSCOPIC,"I ordered this to have as a handy, small quick reference. I had NO idea the print would be this microscopic. It can't even be a 6 pt font - probably more like 4 or 5. It is too tiny to even be able to read. Very sad and would not recommend to anyone no matter how good their eyes are."
2,Almost too small for old eyes.,"I wanted a latest edition NIV for hospital visits, etc. It is small, and the font size is difficult to read. It would be more useful if it included the Psalms."
2,Can't read it!,The font on this pocket bible is sooo small that I can't even read it. Really disappointing because it was a gift for my mom.
5,When I need the Lord's comfort it is in my pocket.,"This little book has travelled in my shirt pocket for years. It is very light, yet durable. I have never babied it, and yet its thin pages have never ripped. When stress and anxiety overcome me, I pull the book out, wherever I am, and read its Holy Word to sooth me. It has Jesus' words in red so they can be easily identified, and has enough margin for notes if you desire. I have given these out as Christmas gifts, and am presently ordering a batch to distribute as my heart prompts me. The only drawback is the type is quite small, so people with vision problems may have trouble reading it (A small pocket magnifying glass will solve that problem)."
5,Handy and Divine,"What a great handy little New Testament! Besides being very small, it has Christ's words in red, a very neat format with headings all throughout, a cloth book mark and even a little index in the back with topics and NT references to look up.Well worth getting if your looking for a great NT that offers A LOT of convenience and quality."
2,Not Leather,"I expected a leather bound pocket New Testament and found it was, according to its own stamped discription, ""Leather-Look."" I also wish that the description had indicated that the ""words of Jesus"" would be in red."
3,Print too small,I knew that the print would be small when I order this pocket size but it was much too small for me - even with my glasses on. I returned it.
2,VERY small font!,"I would never rate a bible ""one star."" HOWEVER, this printing has a font size so small that it is nearly unusable without very bright light and very good vision. In summary, VERY small bible (even for a ""shirt pocket"" bible), VERY small font! I bought five copies and regret it."
5,Beautiful,"I highly recommend this CD, the music is exquisitely beautiful. It makes me feel very calm and peaceful. It feels like it is cleaning my chakras. This music is very suited to fall asleep with, practice yoga and if I have another child I will choose this CD to listen to while giving birth. Thank you Sophia & Band for this heavenly music."
4,Practical Herbal uses,"This is a good, condensed book on herbs and their magical uses as well as health uses. This is not a Wiccan book. Some of the herbs and particularly the way they are used (hexes, love spells, and potions) are very Voodoo oriented. Some spells involve images of saints and a trip to the local Botanica (Santeria-Voodoo occult shop) for saint candles, etc. I can't say that just sprinkling herbs on the floor will give the desired results but it's a good herbal reference. It also has an index of the herbs as called by their native or American names for ease in shopping.My only complaint (other than its size; It's very small--108 pages) is that there's no supplier page in the back."
2,You get what you pay for,"Purchased two of these on clearance for our library; not worth the trouble. One arrived broken and needed a spring replaced (luckily, I was able to do this myself). One print head was defective out of the package and is streaking less than 250 pages later. Both printers skew every page by 1/16"" or more from top to bottom, which makes our letterhead look horrible. Other than that, the print quality is OK, they're pretty quick, and take up a lot of desk space. As for myself, I'll stick with Canon."
3,a little predictable,"This is different take on crime thrillers, quite good with good acting however I found it somewhat predictable."
2,More Drew,"Hello, Well I saw the movie and I thought Drew looked great but it needed more Drew in it like to last in the movie, now scream is a differant story she didn't last but the cast was a great selection and worth watching to see what happens next, I would reccomend Scetch Artist to those who don't like Drew Barrymore hehe, I adore her so that is why I didn't like it. @->---------- :)"
1,"just a cartoon, not a real show (nickerbocker10 please read)","nickerbocker10, Winnie the Pooh is just a cartoon. Not a real Show. Cartoons don't show little kids how to do the right things. Real Shows do. Winnie the Pooh isn't a real show. This show is a funny cartoon. It makes me laugh a lot. Not learn a lot. My little brother, Grant says it's funny, too. He's a little kid and he knows how to do right things. I'm not a little kid and my favorite TV show is Winnie the Pooh. Why would it show little kids how to do the right things, nickerbocker10? Why? It has Freindship and Playtime sets, too. You play on the Playtime ones along with them and Be Friends with them on the Friendship ones. It's not a real show."
5,RvB ROCKS,I've been watching Red vs Blue since its second season was online. To finally own this box set with all of its special features....and remastered? AWESOME. My only complaint is the lack of subtitles.
2,Maybe it's just me.... but I gave up on this book,"First let me say that I'm reviewing Kindle version of this book. Not sure why, but the letters seemed blurry and it just seemed not clear. I've read a lot of kindle books before and never had this problem. So, it wasn't a good start.About 4 percent into the book I was getting irritated by the content as well. Jumping from one topic to another, not getting anywhere deeper and making a point. Since I remembered the book had good reviews I told myself I just had to give it more time. Well, 10 percent into it I gave up. It just seemed the author would never finish an idea, jump to the next one and it just irritated me as someone who keeps talking without making a point.My reading time is special to me and I don't get enough of it. Plus there are so many other great books out there that I just won't bother on suffering through this one. And I will be deleting it from my library."
5,Soooooo encouraging!,"This book has saved my parenting life!!! With love and grace Susan helps you to not just get through the hard times but to make the most of this calling. I wish there was a ""Susan"" next door for every woman to talk to!"
3,Not alone...,"Haven't finished book completely, but the first few chapters made me cry; truly felt like I wasn't alone and I was reading my feelings on ""paper""...."
3,"Ok book, not too impressed","The book was good an easy read. I didn't like how it seemed to talk like motherhood is something to be endured happily, instead of enjoying and cherishing every moment you have even when things are challenging"
4,Having a Food Allergy is OK,"""No Nuts For Me"" focuses on daily life for a child dealing with a severe nut allergy. The daily routine for the boy in the story is exactly the routine for my child. My 4-year-old could see that she is not alone; this book was a confidence builder for her. I will use this book as a resource for educating my childs public-school kindergarten classmates and administrators about life with food allergies. I was having trouble finding this title -- thank you Amazon for making it available."
1,"not about political crime, a text about communist jingoism.","a very twisted book. simply put, it states laws create criminals, and denies the importance of real history and common laws that resulted from the bad preying upon the good. the book continues this inverted argument throughout. the book does not discuss political crime, or corruption, but lectures about ideas from a clear communist social adgenda. the book attacts the real american experience, and substitutes its own unrealistic, dogmatic, and most importantly, unsupported by facts, its own fantasy law."
4,The Day the Music Died,"As a regular at the Garage and its predecessors, I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a must for anyone who lived through that era, in particular New Yorkers who danced at the underground clubs. It brought back memories and was nostalgic. Mel tells the story well and weaves the Garage story into a history of gay New York. It is honest and sometimes sad and tragic. It put my experience of those days into perspective, and gave me inside information on a place and a people who were a big part of my life. Thank you to Mel Cheren."
5,Excellent read,"What I liked most was its easy reading style. Sure, it could have been more comprehensive, technical and detailed, but it was a refreshing and moving reading experience. I like Mr Bova's science fiction but I think he only presents solid credentials for the basis of his fiction with this type of book. The real target for this book would be young people to encourage themselves to look at science and be inspired. Ben said it was ""conversational"" and it certainly was with my eyes rolling over the words and phrases with great ease."
2,Sony or Pioneer,"The user interface is not the best; I use Sony and Pioneer my whole life, so this item for me does not have the basic characteristics for a really good stereo, I both this receiver 1 year ago because in the tech specs I readed that you can control a cd charger from the same brand, but guess what, It never happened, on the display is really hard to find the track time, some usb devices does not support, sometimes the SD slot can't read either, the sound quality depend on the speakers but is the only good think that I found in Blaupunkt the auxiliary devices like input 2 I use for my iPod but the volume is too low, I try everything you can imagine, but isn't working. If I have the opportunity to return the receiver I definitely do it."
3,"Nice, but cannot stand alone","This is a lovely book with some very nice patterns. (Other great books for cards are Anne Redman's and Diane Crane's.) HOWEVER, if you're going to use or give it as a gift, if not already familiar with quilling, make sure to also purchase something more basic, such as Malinda Johnson's treasure trove. This book is definitely not a standalone for beginners. By way of example, most quillers agree that folded roses require lots of practice -- but this book is the first I've ever seen WITHOUT EVEN DIAGRAMS. The average person wouldn't have any chance of mastering folded roses by that brief description alone!"
3,SIMPLISTIC,"I was disappointed at the simple, stark items for quilling. There could have been much more put into the pictures. What was given would have been more appropriate for school age. I did find the instructions very good and easy to understand."
1,Defective product.,One controller did not work. Do not buy this blanket. You will be very disappointed. Returns are a hassle. Once again do not buy this blanket.
4,Not warm enough,"This blanket is great, it just doesn't get quite warm enough for me in the winter. (Other friends who have used it think I am crazy though)."
1,worst ever..don't make em like they used to,"Would give a negative score if I could! In the past 2 years I have had 8 Biddeford electric blanket...from throws to twin to full to queen size. The longest one has last was a month...one did not work new out of the box! My last two worked 2-3 days! I would not say it was just a fluke...that is poor quality! And I follow ever care instruction listed! Not like the old electric blankets ( that is why they are so hard to find)...now those blankets from 20-30 years ago lasted forever and stayed piping hot! Why did I keep buying them? 1. They are one of the only brands around for purchase and 2. They were marked down (guess you get what you pay for...no actually, not even that!) What I wouldn't do for a old Sears blanket!!! Stay away from these unless you are looking for a temporary electric blanket!"
2,Biddeford has bad controllers,"We purchased a king size Biddeford electric blanket about 4 years ago. This model has the digital controllers. I don't know if I just have bad luck, but I plugged it in again today for the upcoming winter and found that one of the controllers didn't work. The same thing happened last year. I have now replaced two digital controllers in one year. Oddly enough, the controllers worked the day before I unplugged them for the summer. Its like they quit working if they sit for a few months. This is the last Biddeford blanket I buy."
2,Controls won't last,"This is the second Biddeford blanket we have had. The blanket is fine. The temperature it keeps is fine. The problem is the controls. Both blankets have lasted one year because of the controls. They stop working and display a E in the control window. Good blanket, lousy controls."
3,electric blanket,"The blanket is fine about the only criticism is that the attachment point for the cables could be a little higher up to allow the bottom of the blanket to be tucked under the mattress at the bottom. Also the instructions say don't tuck this point under the mattress and don't tuck the wires to the attachment point under the mattress. This leaves a lot of wiring on the floor where it can be a tripping hazard or caught in the vacuum on cleaning day. Otherwise the blanket if great. So far it is warm enough that we haven't needed to turn it on too often, and we are saving energy."
5,Wraps You in Complete Warmth and Comfort!! Say Goodbye to a Cold Bed in the Winter!!!,"This electric blanket keeps you surround with plenty of warmth, comfort and coziness!!Luscious sky blue color! heat control has variable temps to keep you warm all day & all night! Atomatic shutoff after each 10-hour use. Just flip the switch off and back on again for continued comfort. Lighted dial for selected heat level from 1 to hot. Prewarm the blanket about a few minutes before you go to bed for great warmth and comfort!!It's almost like having your own personal heating system!! Two-year warranty. You'll NEVER have to get into a cold bed ever again during the winter!! Great product!~Daquan13."
2,It works great...for awhile,"I bought this blanket at a national chain, on sale with my 30% off coupon and it worked great for the first two months. We have the queen-sized blanket with dual controls and my husband didn't even bother to plug his in. I, however, used it religiously, often starting it before brushing my teeth so it can be warming up. All that came to a halt last night when the power unit didn't even light up. I switched units and it's not the wires in the blanket that died, but the unit itself. I then did some online research and discovered that it's not uncommon for these to fail within the first year of purchase (so definitely use those warranties!). Check out this site for more information on electric blankets and electric mattress pads: [...] The Biddeford actually got a Fair-Poor rating for Reliability and I would agree. Works great while it lasts; just not sure how long that will be."
1,WORTHLESS,"Purchased at Target. It started showing an ""E"" message and quit working after a few weeks. I exchanged it at Target. 2nd blanket lasted 3 days before quitting! It's soft and is great IF and WHEN it works."
5,Just what we were looking for,We were looking for a heating blanket that was lite enough to use under our quilt......This is perfect. We wanted dual controls.....this is an awesome product.Thank you sooooooooooooooo much
4,A Fun Collection,"This is a very enjoyable CD. I have heard some of Rice's songs previously, but this is the first album of his that I have heard in its entirety.His music is very mellow, but it has good lyrics and a pleasant sound. The main reason that I bought this CD was that I thought my daughter would enjoy 'Cartoons'. I found that it was not the only 'fun' song on this album. 'Billy Joe McGuffrey' is another great song for kids. Actually, I have enjoyed both of those as well as several of the others also. I particulary like 'Deep Enough to Dream'.If you have a pre-teen or teenager, I would really recommend this for a couple of fun songs. It is also enjoyable for adults."
3,GREAT SHOW BUT TOO EXPENSIVE HERE,"The show itself is great. A real labor of love from creator, producer, and star Allen Hawco. If you are a fan of THE ROCKFORD FILES, then this is the show for you. It has all the elements that made ROCKFORD such a long and enduring hit, only in Canada. So, the locales are beautiful but in a small, quirky town. It's sort of like ROCKFORD meets NORTHERN EXPOSURE. By all means,enjoy.While the show is, without a doubt, five stars, I gave the transaction only three. You see, here in America, the DVD sets are way too expensive. I bought the first season from Amazon.ca for HALF the US price. In my haste,when I saw season two for sale, I hit the wrong button, forgetting to realize that I could get this same set, brand new and region one, for HALF THE PRICE from Amazon.ca. It's a mistake I won't make again."
2,One KitchenAid Attachment to skip,"Maybe I just don't understand what this is supposed to do. KitchenAid attachments are usually wonderful enhancements to their basic appliances. But I haven't been able to create volume or foam in drinks with this attachment. Can't see that it does much more than a spoon, and certainly doesn't do as much as a plain wire whisk. It's not portable like those cheap, little drink mixers. When I'm at home, I have my immersion blender - a much better option for mixing liquids. Maybe this is good for something I haven't tried yet."
1,Disappointing,Stiff drawings illustrate a stilted story. A rather disappointing attempt to create a Christmas classic.
2,Waste of money,"Very weak film in all respects. The plot is dull, the execution is below average. The best of the package is the cover of the box."
4,Memories from the Sixties!,"I remember this show from when it was originally aired. I loved it and was sorry that it was taken off after only one season. Of course, if it hadn't left the air John Aston wouldn't have been available for the Addams Family. Can't wait for the second half of the season to be released."
3,I got it as a gift .,Was given as a gift. the family like old TV shows. this was on a wish list. I have not seen it yet.
4,Dickens / Fenster 50 year memory,"I was 5 when I last saw this show, but I remember it being very funny. 50 years later it's still funny, great slapstick, and great performances by Astin & Ingels. The sets are cheap, staging is dated, but it still made me laugh. One complaint only and that is that they should have added closed captioning. After 50 years I imagine a lot of the show's fans are hard of hearing."
4,Reasonable price with very long cord,"I tried to find a long cord headphone for a long time. Finally, I found it! Amazon does not tell that this product has long cord. I had to find the information from other websites. However, I got it and I love it. I use it when i watch TV and my roommate studies. It works! I don't miss my favorite programs any more and my roommate can read her books at the same time. It's also good to use with my notebook."
3,Good book,"Good book for introduction to political quantitative research. But I felt there could have been more to it. Perhaps more examples, data sets on the CD included. The CD is very limited. The chapters were pretty easy to follow but could have used graphics to make it easier to follow along and to reference back to find a particular section."
4,good introduction to scholary research,"this is a good book for those who want to understand what it takes to write a good scholary work. the underpinings of statistics and how they are used. the only weakness is that there are times when even the most advanced student needs an teacher, why i give a four in stead of five stars. but it is still a wonderful resourced for all."
4,SPSS Companion to Political Anslysis,"This is a lab book, so don't buy it unless it has the CD, or if it's been written in. Now that I'm half way through the class, I can say it is helpful. The companion book does not have to go with the text book. PROFESSORS - DON'T MAKE US BUY TWO TEXT BOOKS, JUST TO USE THIS LAB BOOK. If you like a different text book better than Pollock's recommend it only. Thanks! (A former college bookstore manager who has decided it is time to get a Master's degree.)"
2,Found mistakes just glancing through,"While browsing through this book at the library, I opened it up to the short descriptions of the states.The capital of Minnesota is NOT Minneapolis. It's St. Paul. That's a pretty ridiculous mistake."
5,Nels Cline and his Fender Jazzmasters,"The present incarnation of this band seems to have the greatest chemistry of any band to ever exist in the history of this galaxy. They have put aside all egos to just allow themselves to produce the most pure and beautiful music to come out of America in the past 10 years. Everyone knows their role in the band and execute that role in fine fashion. This DVD will soon see a well-deserved spot on the top-ten list of best DVDs ever produced in ANY category, along with ""Rush R30"". And it's too bad that most 16 year-old girls will never understand the subtle beauty of Nels Cline's Fender Jazzmaster."
5,Gorgeous Work,"The cinematography and music are gorgeous, they come together well to support the lyrics that form the heart of this film. The music mixes are excellent. It's greatly ""watchable"" and the fact that you also get a track by track download of the tunes makes it a no-brainer. Given the amount of work that went into this thing I really wonder how many they'll need to sell just to cover the production costs! (assuming all the crew got paid scale, and I bet they had fun regardless)I got a kick out of someone's comment asking if it's available on Blu-ray. It's a good point but hey, we're not talking about a megalomaniac like Madonna or something...this is Wilco: a hard working bunch of altruistic guys, who clearly find meaning, and enjoy performing, in the clubs that inspired the musicians who inspired them."
4,Introduction to RF Propagation Review,I am an EE but have been out of school for 35 years. This book was needed to bring me back up to speed on RF effects on low band VHF propagation. It is well written and the math is well explained. This allowed me to understand the text and the math and apply it to my problem. Well worth the cost.
3,Outstanding in your field,"My rating is insignificant. I have not yet read the book.Just wanted to share an error with you.P. 14, Section 2.2 ""The Electric Field"". The equation is wrong.It is written as: E = eDIt should be: D = eEwhereD is the electric flux density vector (coulomb / m^2)e (epsilon) is the permittivity of the medium (farads/meter)E is the electric field vector (newtons per coulomb (N/C) or volts per meter (V/m) )Also, on P. 15, TABLE 2.1 the equations for the Electric Field intensity are incorrect.Their units are wrong...Electric Field units are newtons per coulomb (N/C) or volts per meter (V/m).For the Infinite line charge: E = (linear charge density (lambda)) / (2*pi*r*e) * r_hat (e = epsilon)For the Infinite surface charge: E = (surface charge density (sigma)) / (2*e) * r_hat (e = epsilon)Note: lambda has units of coulombs/meter , sigma has units of coulombs / m^2"
3,Haven't read the whole book,"I'm just using this book as a reference and wanted to highlight an error. Just ignore the rating because I haven't read the whole book thoroughly, but I'm forced to give a rating.Page 196, first paragraph:""If the signal bandwidth is less than the coherence bandwidth, B < Bc, then the channel is considered wideband or flat (flat fading). Otherwise, it is called a narrowband channel (selective fading).""The terms wideband and narrowband seems to have been switched. Narrowband channels are flat fading, while wideband channels are frequency selective fading."
4,comical view from a small- town veterinarian,"I enjoyed reading Dr. Lucas' book about life in rural Iowa . The book touched on all the human emotions . I laughed many times throughout the book, yet I also found myself close to tears . Dr. Lucas portrays an honest , uncensored look at life as a veterinarian. A real eye-opener to the good , country life that many people are looking for."
2,Not the best DVD,"I was disappointed in this DVD. I really didn't want to compare it to the Baby Einstein Baby Mozart DVD, but it's impossible not to. The images on this Baby Genius DVD stay on the screen for longer periods of time and they tend to be more pastel rather than primary. Also, on the Genius DVD, there are images of animals (a brown squirrel running around on brown grass - which makes no sense to me since babies are stimulated by bright colors) and children who really aren't doing anything that entertaining or interesting. I really prefer the Baby Einstein Baby Mozart DVD because the images are brighter, they rotate in shorter periods of time (keeping my son's interest piqued), and the hand puppets and toys shown are just generally better and more interesting than the Baby Genius DVD. If you're looking to get a DVD and can't decide between Baby Genius and Baby Einstein, go with the Einstein."
1,Needs more diversity!,"What world does the writer of this childrens video live in? This video lacks each and every minority child known. There is nothing but, white children throughout! I can't believe a person would make a film that doesn't represent atleast a couple of minorities in it. However, almost every animal is featured. I would never purchase anymore of these dvds. Something that doesn't view God's world in it - doesn't belong in my home and isn't worth my dollar."
2,boring cd,"unlike the ""Children's Favorite Songs"" one, which my bb loves, this one bores her...picture and animation are not as good as CFS...a disappointment..."
1,Pens are junk!,pens don't work! cheap don't buy!!! I've tried 5 pens out of 12 and none worked at all. And they're uncomfortable to hold in hand.
2,One to Grow on.....,"Real quick and to the point this is average at best. I am a Dead Prez and Outlaw fan, but this seems rushed. I know they could have done better than this. M1 from Dead Prez is not on most of the album and Kastro from Outlawz is not to present either. They put a song on here from Get Free or Die Tryin'(maybe for those who did not hear it) and that kind of bothered me.I know it's a mix cd and not an official album but still they could have done better. I can't lie it has grown on me a little more now, cause when I first got it I was like this is whack. Hardcore fans should get it, if you are new to both groups get something else, this is a bad representation of them."
2,what a dissapointment,"This was the biggest let down ever after the 1st two Dead Prez albums I was sold, but this one has maybe three good songs the others are kind of weak and lack the same black nationalism that the two previous Dead Prez albums had. I would not recommend this album but I still would recommend buying their other albums because they are still jamming today. and what outlaws was these, they didn't sould like the outlawz from 2Pac. These outlawz was wack"
5,Excellent!,I am extremly happy with the product. I recieved an open product and they were so kind and quickly sent another shampoo as a replacement. Thank u so much! very fast service
3,Ok,"This is a shampoo for normal hair. My hair tends towards dry, and I found this shampoo a bit more drying than other shampoos I've used. It doesn't lather much, which takes a bit of getting used to, and my hair does come out clean.Basically I chose this product as the company claims to use all natural ingredients (and organic ingredients where they can). It was the only one at the health food store that didn't contain carcinogenic compounds in the ingredient list as far as I could tell (at least they were according to my research, it's possible I could be misinformed, I'm no scientist).And, most importantly, it contains camomile which is supposed to highlight my hair (which also happens to be thin - hence the volumnizing).However, I didn't like the honeysuckle rose conditioner, it stinks."
4,That Last Scene,"Dated as it might be, it remains as one of the few ""must see"" films for ski enthusiasts and students of the sport's history. It also contains one of the most haunting images of any film of its era. That is, the very last scene, when Redford locks eyes with the unidentified, teenage German (if I recall correctly) racer who has fallen on the last steep section of the downhill course. The difference between first and last, in ski racing as in many other pursuits, is sometimes razor thin. The glances exchanged among the German kid, Redford, and Hackman are a magnificent example of actors imparting with subtle expressions volumes more than dialog could have."
4,Cold ambition,"Dating from 1969, Downhill Racer holds up remarkably well both as a character study and a visually impressive journey into the world of Olympic skiing. Robert Redford, in the title role, plays an egotistical loner aiming for Olympic Gold. Coming from a background of rural poverty, he is fiercely determined to achieve fame and fortune. Often abrasive and laconic, he is openly contemptuous of people who lack his ambition, and resentful of those who have been born to wealth. Gene Hackman provides an interesting foil, recognizing his ability, but manipulating him for his own purposes. All this plays out against a background of lofty mountain scenery and high-speed ski runs. There is something very legitimate about the characterizations here: the implicit subtext is that success requires both relentless perseverance and an element of cold-bloodedness."
2,For visuals only,"Downhill Racer is essentially, a movie to see only for the terrific skiing sequences. Although there is a story here, Robert Redford's character, a skier trying to make the U.S. Olympic team, is so bland and unsympathetic that you wonder why to care about him at all. Gene Hackman, in an early performance, adds nicely, but this is a film that could be watched with the sound off, and it wouldn't make much of a difference."
3,Same as the old video,"With a lot of the music played by Oistrakh represented now on DVD as complete compositions, to have clips like this now longer holds the urgency for people to get this. For accuracy, he plays HALF of the ""Intermezzo"" from the Symphonie Espagnole which is not indicated. (On that piece it seems that is all there is). I pointed this error out to the people at Kultur years ago and they chose to leave it as was. Now they just have been re-releasing their video catalogue on DVD clearly without any real effort to restore picture/sound (even leaving obvious flaws) and not adding any new material."
3,He is much better violinist than this DVD is,"I came from Russia and am familiar with David Oistrakh violin playing. He was a great performer. Many violinists, as itzhak Perlman for example, consider him as one of the best in the world. But this DVD does not show that. Very superficial."
1,misleading picture and bad return procedure,the picture at amazon.com is misleading with a pan included.the return procedure of macy's is very bad. they said the return tag is included in the package but actually it's not. I have to send many emails to get it returned.
3,Obtrusive use of cartoon images,"This video is slow - good for small children who shouldn't be exposed to lots of flashing movement. The classical music is nice. The videography is nothing to write home about, but there are plenty of animals to be seen. My 18 month old daughter oohs and aahhs over them all.What I cannot fathom is why the creators decided to superimpose cartoon animal pop-ups on the screen every minute or so. It is incredibly annoying and seems so out of place!"
3,Not as entertaining as the Mozart and Friends Sleepytime,"I nought this DVD to introduce animals to my now 12 month old daugther. I believe she was about 9 or 10 months old when I ordered it and I noticed how it didn't make much of an impact inher. In fact, she was more interested in the Mozart and Friends Sleepytime DVD.This video has animals but also cartoons. I still play it now that she is 12 months old and she just doesn't find it entertaining."
5,Turning 3 and still likes to watch 'Zoo',"My daughter has enjoyed this since a bit before her 1st birthday. We are a 'light' TV and Video family, so this suits our style. She has always enjoyed the animals and watches just about the whole DVD. She now requests the accompanying Music CD in the car. ""My music please - Classical""."
3,Baby Genius - A Trip to the San Diego Zoo - ok for maybe young children,"This would maybe be ok for younger children under 1 that like to see animals, but don't expect them to sit through it, our 18 month old get's bored about 1/4 way through and is done."
4,Mirinda (Wonderful!),"The Teach Yourself Series is a great modality for learning and/or acquiring a second language. Esperanto: A complete course for beginners, is exactly what it says! I have used other TY books, and the quality and level of material learned is excellent for adult learners either studying alone or in a group setting.Definately worth the money.....recommended without reservation!"
3,It's OK,"I have a semi-serious penchant for collecting older ""learn a language"" books, so I purchased this book online from Amazon. Plus I was curious about Esperanto. Now, you can teach yourself the basics of Esperanto from this book, but, let's be realistic, Esperanto's not really a language. I think Esperanto has real value in teaching English-language students about inflected languages, and demonstrating the comparative linguistics of Romance (and to a greater extent Indo-European) languages, but it's not like you're going to learn basic Esperanto, zip off to Paris, and converse with someone at a cafe. You need to join a club to do that.The book's OK, like any basic learn a language book there's words and phrases, basic grammar, questions and answers, that kind of thing. But unless you're a collector, I wouldn't spend $44 on this out-of-print edition; you can buy a different but new in-print Esperanto book for $15 from Amazon."
5,A must have,"If you are interested in the Victorian era, this is a thorough and comprehensive study of the period. A classic!"
1,I hate velcro,I bought this to use as an everyday lanyard and I can not put my keys on it and feel safe because the velcro at the end. I absolutely do not like it and will now be purchasing a new one else where.
4,great,it great nothing wrong with it had it for 4 weeks and the lettering has not worn off . i was afraid it would because it looks like it was glued onto it but so far it looks great.
1,Poor quality with cut and paste velcro. As you can see there is no velcro on this picture--at all.,Item not like shown. Misleading. Should have had more of an accurate description so I would not have wasted my money.
2,This Must Stop..,"This movie is just great and nostalgic for some of us....Arquettes and Weavings performances are just great in this sweet romantic comedy that won't be easily forgotten ....Anyways...I won't bother myself with writing too much details because in the end I absolutely won't recommend it for the sake of a pervert ""Inc"" called ""Direct Source""...I mean the movie is totally remarkable ...but the quality is just way too unbearable...I just don't undestand how did those people found the guts to distribute some cult classic with a bad repulsive quality that kept me trying to determine the characters faces I mean the image is way too blurred... oh and the audio..it just keeps going and coming like a gentle visitor...this is just too depressing ...I guess that the price speaks for itself.....Please amazon ...clean your stock from this garbage."
4,Good Value for the History Buff,"Among these nine movies, the quality of storytelling (and DVD transfers) vary, but this boxed set is a good value for anyone interested in vintage historical flicks, especially considering that some of these films are virtually impossible to find anywhere else. Contents include:*HENRY VIII AND HIS SIX WIVES (movie version of the classic British TV series)*FIRE OVER ENGLAND with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh*SINS OF ROME with Massimo Girotti as Spartacus*EAGLE IN A CAGE about Napolean in exile, with John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson*CONSTANTINE AND THE CROSS with Cornel Wilde as the first Christian emperor*LADY HAMILTON about the lover of Lord Horatio Nelson*SARABANDE FOR DEAD LOVERS a romance about King George of England*THE IRON DUKE with George Arliss as the Duke of Wellington*SCOTT OF THE ANTARCTIC starring John Mills (with a score by Vaughn Williams!)"
3,Hard To Find Historicals,"Unfortunately, a few of the movies are in poor condition - Sarabande (terrible lighting, very washed out, faded look to it) and Lady Hamilton (freezes in spots about the middle of the film).However, the two I bought it for ""The Wives Of Henry VIII"" and ""Fire Over England"" are in great shape and worth the price of the collection.""Sins of Rome"" is another re-telling of the Spartacus tale and was much better than I expected.Overall, ""History at the Movies"" is the bargain the other reviewers claim it is and I wasn't sorry I made this purchase."
3,A miexed bag.,"This compilation has some excellent films, like the Henry VIII, Scott of the Antartic, Saraband for Dead Lovers(This last unfortunately in rather poor quality)Others are not as good, but none of them is a complete turkey, and all have some interest for historical film buffs, and at this price it is a real bargain. You won't regret it."
3,History at the Movies DVD Multi-pack,"Overall, good fun. The visual quality is just okay, though with such old films that might be expected. The choice of films varies from high quality to old Saturday matinee. That said, still glad I bought it, particularly for the opportunity to see Stewart Granger in Sarabande for Lost Lovers, and Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh in Mrs. Hamilton. Keith Mitchell's performance in Henry the VIII and His Six Wives is worth the price of the three-disk set in itself. For true old British movie buffs there's George Arliss in The Iron Duke."
5,A journey into the depths of rock 'n' roll,"Don't let the name confuse you - New York City's The Last Show are coming to town, but it's not a finale. In fact, The Last Show is only beginning. With their debut EP, the cleverly titled sleEP, just released, the band is touring extensively to promote their new material.SleEP is a four-song journey into the depths of rock 'n' roll's underbelly. With heavily distorted guitars and grinding, dirge-like rhythms, the minimalist three-piece is hoping to make their mark in the current garage-rock revival. The liner notes read ""This is The Last Show, now Sleep..."" but there won't be any dosing at this gig at Tulagi."
3,"Cute, yet surprisingly not completely obvious","This is the kind of book an uncle or aunt gives you as a present before you are about to start law school; you brush it off but then notice it's comforting to have around every now and then when you feel a bit crummy or discouraged during your 1L year. Definitely a fun little book to browse through. It's a little book of ""tips"" that are not totally commonplace (a lot are, but there are a few to pick from that aren't that bad...and work). For example, it may seem silly to use this as an example from all the tips, but the one on using air fresheners around your home is something small yet it really does make it a bit more pleasant to be home...and study...she explains it much more eloquently. But it all falls under the theme of giving yourself room to unwind in the stress that befalls your life during 1L year. As long as you're mentally prepared for it, you CAN begin to see that's it really is all just small stuff!"
4,Helpful tidbits for people entering law school,"This book isn't perfect, but it does have some great common sense advice. Definitely check this book out if you're entering law school. A lot of the info contained here, such as how to handle the stress, most people (such as myself) don't figure out until their third year."
3,Not worth it.,"You'd get about the same information from talking to a couple 3L's for ten minutes... There were a few useful pointers, mostly about what to expect. It helped me not to freak out so much in the first days.But I found her to be very melodramatic about several things. Maybe she's just dating herself, or maybe it's just my law school, but the classroom is not nearly as confrontational as it used to be (and as she makes it out to be). Most of my professors are wonderful, interesting people who are not out to get me.I would borrow this book from someone if you're curious or just that nervous (which I was)."
2,Oh dear...,"Another stinker from Professor Ashley who seems to be making something of a career out of hack-n-paste occult books. This, like its predecessors, is the rough notes for a book - held together with weak humour and sundry howlers - rather than a book itself. To make matters worse, as he'd already dealt with Satanism in a previous volume, much of this grab-bag has precious little to do with 'devil's disciples'. Instead, it's a sort of random selection of hokey lists and spooky facts, and little else. Admittedly, easy to dip into, but equally easy to put down. Feeble."
1,Poor translation of actual events,"I was one of the Scouts personally involved with Dan Stevens' rescue, and it was surely a case of ""right time, right place"", but we handled the situation properly and swiftly. In this account though, we are written off like the cast of the Sopranos. Every line ""quoted"" from a New Jersey participant is fraudulent, and written to add cliche humor to a skewed story. None of us are from the inner city, all but one New Jersey scout eventually made the rank of Eagle, and we all revere the outdoors, even to this very day. I personally earned a degree in biology, and just finished a two-week excursion through the entire Grand Canyon for a second time, with members of the Minnesota crew. The hero Dan Stevens broke wilderness rule number one: Don't venture off alone! This is hack writing at it's finest, and any real authors should be appalled that this person is published."
2,ok stories....,The stories themselves were ok. Though very burdened with words... too many and too complex for such a simple story.
4,An epic journey of luck and survival,Interestingly the fact that either of these guys survived is miracle. The stories are well told and remarkable though both offer more insight into classic wilderness error than survival. This book offers more about the generosity of volunteer search and rescue than of wilderness survival.
4,It's easy to get turned around in the North Woods,"This book gives two accounts of people lost in the North Woods. It was well written and the author definitely did their homework. Both accounts started out as routine trips into the Minnesota wilderness. Dan Stephens and Jason Rasmussen both made critical errors that while reading you might say, ""they should've known better"". Maybe not. When the author puts you in their shoes it is easier to see how these things happen. Just a couple of mistakes can quickly turn a bad situation into a dire one. I thought it was pretty impressive how quickly and efficiently search and rescue is able to mobilize in that part of the state. Especially since the efforts are comprised mainly by volunteers."
3,Lost in the Wild,"It was ok, but didnt have as much survival stuff as I thought and wished it would..was more about the rescue."
4,Two Great Wilderness Survival Stories,"I looked forward to reading from this book whenever I could. I enjoy wilderness survival stories and found this one to be well-researched and written. I haven't ever been to Northern Minnesota so the book taught me about the wilderness there and delivered a home run on the survival stories. The author did a good job of transitioning back and forth between two survival stories separated in time, but in the same general area. There were about 20 awkward words that caused me to pause and scratch my head as to the meaning . . . simpler words could have been used to make the sentences flow more smoothly. Lost in the Wild is a good book to read for anyone venturing out into the wilderness. There are some good lessons-learned from these characters. It is amazing how quickly you can get lost in the wild. If you like real outdoor adventure stories, you may also consider readingRocky Mountain Adventure Collection. Cary, thank you for the enjoyable reading."
2,Mislabeled product,Its decent kit for regular every ports. I wanted Mini USB A pin which the description says that they have.. but they clearly dont. The review is based on the product description not the quality of the product itself. I actually liked the way it was setup.. I also did not like the customer experience with JR when I tried to sell it.
1,Do Not Purchase!,I purchased this item to get the USB 2.0 Micro (A) attachment shown in the image. Product was replaced by a completely diffect item carring the same Model #. Intentional misslead! The product sent to me had 4 phone/cat 5 adapters instead of the the USB adapters as shown. Seller has purposely sent out wrong equipment. Buyer beware!
5,Great,"Songs like ""Shadow Captain"" and ""Cold Rain"" are great. Not a bad song in this collection. I like the cover of the CD too."
3,worth the nostalgia,"I bought this album on a whim, when something reminded me of this favorite from my senior year of high school. The lyrics don't do as much for me as they did in 1977, but the smooth harmonies still hold up. I wouldn't call the album a must-have in the oeuvre of Crosby, Still, Nash, (and Young), but I'm glad to have added another item to my collection of CDs that replace my 70s LPs. A better investment for those who like this stuff would be the ""new"" Neil Young album of his 1971 concert in Massey Hall. That's priceless."
4,Great cd,Very good later work from these guys. One of my favorites. An excellent choice if I may say so myself.
4,This is a good album,"Not my favorite Crosby, Stills and Nash cd, but I still like it. Their harmonies are marvelous as usual. I personally like Cold rain and Cathedral the best. Of course one of their most radio friendly hits is on this album--Just a song before I go. It was rumored that Graham Nash wrote the song waiting on his plane at the airport. One of the guys said, ""Hey Graham, while we're waiting why don't you write a song"" And what an incredible song it turned out to be. If you like albums where the group actually writes the words to their own songs than you will enjoy any Crosby, Stills and Nash album."
4,"International intrigue, Nevil Shute-style","The Cold War is underway and--oh wait a minute, it's the 1920's. Nonetheless, the Soviets are already up to their shenanigans--hiring German and English aviators to do stealthy reconnaisance flights over Portsmouth, England for reasons that aren't made absolutely clear.One of them crashes his Breguet Nineteen on the South Downs between Winchester and Under, where he's found in bad shape by our hero Moran. The aviator looks familiar--wasn't he in the Flying Corps, Ninety-Two Squadron back in 1917? Well... maybe. But how did a good English lad get mixed up in this Soviet business?The most memorable chapter is a solo flight Moran takes from England to Italy, navigating with a couple of map pages torn from an Encyclopedia Brittanica, sustaining himself en route with a flask of brandy and a couple of sandwiches made by the girl we hope he'll marry if he makes it back to England alive...Thanks for a fun ride, Mr. Shute."
5,Mysterious Aviator,"It is great to have so many of the Nevil Shute titles (maybe all of them) available via these quality reprints. This is my second order of a reprint of a Shute book and I am very pleased. I had a problem with my first order (a wrinkled page not discovered until much later) and the publisher took care of it - good for them! There are many Shute fans out there and even though original copies of his titles are much desired, it is nice to be able to obtain them easily through this publisher."
1,Lovely shoe to look at,This shoe is a beautiful green. Comfort and quality is lacking. It cuts across my bunion and I was unable to take even 5 steps in it. The toe box is very small and the heel is very wide. This is not a shoe for mild bunions. After taking it off and wrapping it back into the box to return I noticed the stitching is not done very well. The green almost looks as though it is painted on. The bottom side of the shoe the green just stops and the shoe is a cream color.
5,Peter Gabriel at his absolute best - the SO tour,"This is a magnificent film. It captures Peter Gabriel at his best - during the SO tour. I have been a Peter Gabriel fan for years - and his ""SO"" concert was the best live show I've ever seen. A very young Youssou N'Dour from Senegal was on this tour (and sang on songs like ""In Your Eyes""). The concerts were full of a remarkable energy (and the songs had such meaning - especially ones like ""Biko"" and ""Games without Frontiers""). POV has complete versions of all of Gabriel's best songs such as ""San Jacinto"", ""Shock the Monkey"", ""Solsbury Hill"", ""Mercy Street"", ""Sledgehammer"", ""Games Without Frontiers"", ""In Your Eyes"", ""Biko"" and much more. A true classic!"
3,Muy bueno,"El precio es bastante razonable, es un bulto muy resistente y grande, puedo meter todo lo necesario para un dia de entrenamiento o tomarlo para vacaciones"
4,Nice made bag,"Very good quality and looking bag.Easy to separate your clean from dirty clothes with the dry extending pocket that splits both spaces depending on their content.There is a pocket on the side perfect for your shoes. Just the right size, and very durable.It is a little bit too big to fit easily in the gym lockers though, I always have to squish it a little bit: I would recommend getting the smaller size."
2,A Bag for the whole Team?,"I read the reviews before buying and a lot of what they said it correct, but I have to question the size. As soon as I opened the box it came in, it looked VERY big. I checked the dimensions and it is too large to have as a carry on with any airline. This is what I wanted it for. It is even larger than the dimensions listed in the product description. It is well built and attractive, but will have to be checked if on air travel. I'm a little disappointed with the product description."
4,great bag,"I bought this bag because it looked like the best option. I got the bigger size, but I really should have gone with the smaller one. The big one doesn't fit in a gym locker too well. Besides its size, everything about it is perfect: it's got a separate compartment for your shoes, side pockets for swimwear and valuables, and a big main compartment. Also works great as a travel bag.Strongly recommended for those who go to the gym a lot and need a quality bag."
5,Fantastic gym bag,"I've had it over a year, still use it all the time, it is always in the car or in the gym. I keep a lot of goodies in my gym bag too, supplements and equipment, clothes, shoes, work supplies, you name it.Very rugged and does the job, still no tears or noticable wear, and I beat it up."
4,Functional and sturdy,"I bought this bag to take to the gym at work and love that it has a compartment for my shoes. It fits pretty well in the locker at work and it feels really sturdy. The only complaint I have is that I could use more small pockets to stick things in (ie. hair products, keys, wallet, headphones, etc.)."
4,Under Armour Large Team Duffle (Black),"This is a very robust and well constructed bag.It feels like it will last for a long time.It has an excellent wet storage area and ample side and front compartments. The only disapointment is the lack of any internal pouches for storage of money ,keys etc which means it unfortunately cant be a five star product.Other that that a very good bag."
5,BEYOND GREAT,WORDS CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW GREAT THIS BOOK IS. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MEET MR.JOHNSON IN 2005 OR 2006 DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN WHERE HE PERSONALLY AUTOGRAPHED MY BOOK FOR ME. I READ THIS BOOK ABOUT 3 TIMES. HE'S A NICE GUY AND A WONDERFUL WRITER. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK.
2,Umm....,I'm a bit confused here.....I can respect cutting-edge and new ideas. But this CD is neither.
1,Terrible,"This is the first time listening to this guy even though I've heard his name before but this is garbage...JUNK. Noise, no melody nothing....I just can't fathom how any reasonable person could give it more than 2 stars. This album is no better than the static you hear when the radio is on the wrong frequency."
2,Horrible songs,"This CD was a disappointer for me. I understand that digweed is a sort of pioneer for music with progressive house with no real climax. I listened to the whole CD as soon I recieved it. The only thing that I can say that I liked about it was the transition between each song. That element is very smooth and enjoyable, however, the songs itself are horrible. There are a few songs in here that I probably wouldn't even consider music because their is no rhythm. It is more like a beat with obnoxious sounds playing with no smoothness. I actually couldn't listen to a few songs for the simple fact that it was very annoying. I had read good reviews so I decided to purchase, but only really liked 2 or 3 of the songs on this disc. If your a diehard fan of slow, continous music of this sort, you may like it. But if your not, you will be severely disappointed. The only way to enjoy this is if your on drugs, and if that's the case, it's not good music. I'm glad I bought it used."
2,Trance zzzzzzz,"As much as I like John Digweeds music, I have to say this album didn't impress me very much. I hate to say it, but it actually put me to sleep. Sorry Mr. Digweed, maybe next time."
1,I threw it away,"The book was a disappointment. I'm not prudish, but involving the clergy, religious implements and incest goes across the line. I can't comment on the ending... I was too turned off to reach the conclusion"
2,bad acting / script ...but pretty good effects.,"At some point in the first 20 minutes the acting is soo bad that it lookslike a high school project. Yes i fast fowarded most of the boring stuff,and was at least pleased with the special effects and make up work doneon the actors...even some of it is pretty impressive...but bottom lineits not the worse but sure aint the best... Good for a rental"
1,"""Contagium"" Review!","Messy and dull name-only sequel to George A. Romero's ""Day Of The Dead"", ""Contagium"" isn't so much badly made as it is just mind-numbingly boring. The story follows a group of mental patients who accidentally expose themselves to top secret Russian chemicals which turn them into zombies. The plot synopsis is far more interesting than the actual execution. I've seen a lot of bad zombie movies but this one is just painful. Not even worth the rental."
2,Sad To Say........I should listen,"Since I am a huge zombie/horror fan,I read the reviews for Day Of The Dead 2 and how bad the film was, I decided to take a chance on it...and there were some good parts that I thought was good...but when the zombies started to talk.....that pretty much blew it for me. I was dissapointed..maybe sometimes u shoul listen to the majority of the people!!"
2,"Good title, okay movie",This movie was not that bad. The plot was okay but the acting could have been a lot better. I think they could have been more original and creative and had a better setting than at a mental institution. Other than that this is one movie that I will watch one a rainy day when theres nothing better to do just to pass the time.
2,The title was the best part...,"So I just finished watching this. It was sort of entertaining but compared to Day of the Dead it wasn't good. The acting was bad, the story was fair, but lacked some explanation. The only real good part was the gore. Cheesy, yes, but cool none the less. At least the ""actors"" weren't the pretty boys that star in most modern horror films although I presume that's beause of the budget. Rent this one for the hell of expanding your zombie movie knowledge but it is mediocre at best."
1,Worst movie EVER!!!,"Being a fan of George A Romero's dead trilogy and his newest (and believe me,far superior)Land of the Dead.....this movie absolutely STINKS!!!...it is unwatchable and has no entertainment value whatsoever..this movie looks like it was filmed with a high-end camcorder,should have been on Lifetime(I was waiting for Meredith Berney,Delta Burke or that chick from One day at a Time to be in this turd of a flick)...I couldnt give this movie zero stars so I was forced to give it 1...do yourself a favor,get Land of the Dead which is released on the same day and enjoy that movie.......as for this movie,A coma would Suffice.........ZERO STARS!!!"
1,RIP OFF,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD - DO NOT RENT THIS DVD. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DAY OF THE DEAD (MY FAVORITE IN THE QUADRILOGY OF THE DEAD FROM GEORGE ROMERO)IF YOU ARE A REAL HORROR FAN, IF YOU ARE A REAL ZOMBIE MOVIE FAN, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE.... DONT LOOSE YOUR TIME"
1,Waste of a title,"When I first heard and read about this movie, I was all excited and could not wait for it to come out. Unfortunately, I made the mistake and brought this movie. This moveis SUCKS BIG TIME!!!!!!!The title is a waste, how dare these people say that this is a tribute to George Romero's movies. According to what I had read it was a prequel to GR's Night of the Living Dead and Sequel to Day of the Dead.Basically, this movie was horrorable, it was a combination of really Low budget gore, rip off of Return of the Living Dead, with these 5 retards that turn into talking zombies (Return of the Living) and then you have your other zombies who just want to eat on human flesh. This was waste of money, time and anything else you can thing of.This is not even worth 1 star, but had no choice since there's no options for a rating of 0"
3,DAWN OF THE DEAD II : CONSTIPATION,"With the exception of the title being DAWN OF THE DEAD, there is little connection between this film and the original Romero settings. Bad dialogue and awful special effects halp to make this film the disaster that it is.On the flip side though, it is unique in its own way, sporting a slightly (and I use that word loosely) new twist on the zombie contagion. Pistols with no muzzle flare, Russian spies captured on American soil in uniform and zombies that enjoy comradary as well as conversation all help to make this move what it is.If you like B (and I mean B) movies, then this one's for you."
2,Day of the Dead 2 - Craptagium,This movie was the dumbest thing out. They should be ashamed to attribute it to the day of the dead line of movies. The characters are transparent or just plain stupid. They plot sucked and the ending was the worst. I know that sometimes the end must sometimes to be left open in order to leave rom for a sequel but this movie could put you off these types of movies for good. Not worth buying. At least if you get it as a present you could trade it back for something good.
2,"Good idea ,bad film",I read all the reviews about this film and thought i would take a chance.Its a shame that it was so badly made.I mean the idea was qutie good.As a zombie film fan it would be nice to see an idea of how it all started but this just was so badly done.The gore was ok but WOOF the rest stinks
1,Contagium means TERRIBLE,"I don't understand how they can call this movie a prequal/sequal?There is a Prequal to the original Day of the Dead...it's called DAWN OF THE DEAD. This movie has nothing to do with the original DAY at all, except for the title.I'm sure this movie had a big budget but it wasn't spent on the movie, it was spent buying the name Day of the Dead to slap on their turd of a movie.I was going to try and be open about this movie when I bought it. No Romero...hey cool...as long as you keep the spirit and story the same I'm game but this movie...ugh! That's all I have to say."
1,every day has a begining... hopefully this one has an end,well let me point out the 2 flaws that i remember 1 they spelt the title wrong 2 they said theres a desert in PA these aren't the only flaws just the ones i remember the acting? is almost as bad as the plot its about a disease in a hospital turned mental hospital found in a soup thermus (?) and guess what it turns the infectents into zombies this movies budject must be as small as the writers brain when a gun is shot the actor? just raises it in the air like he shot it NO EFFECT people are devoured so quickly it seems IMPOSSIBLEthis movie is so bad that you should train your gag reflexes before watching
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I am a die hard george romero fan, any unnoficial sequels or remakes that relate to his movies, im usually all about. i saw this thinking that it would have that same romero 80s DOTD feel. nothing. this was the worst 10 dollars ive ever spent in my life. the story line and acting are just plain terrible, and romero fan or not this is more of a disgrace to george, no, EVERY zombie horror film in existence. i know what youre thinking, ""eh ill give it a try it cant be THAT bad"" no. its awful. dont order this i promise youre not missing a damn thing."
1,A Bad Zombie Film...,"I received this as a Christmas present in 2005, which is 3 years ago, and how long it's been since I watched it. I watched about 2:00 AM Christmas night, and as I watched it, I realized that it sucked. It had nothing to do with Romero's Zombie flicks at all whatsoever and was probably a cheap cash-in on his franchise! There was a part that was disgusting to me when all the patients were sitting around eating, then they all throw up on each other, and they are still eating! If you love Romero's Dead series, PLEASE, DO NOT WATCH DAY OF THE DEAD 2: CONTAGIUM!!!"
1,One star is being kind,"I have to say that I am never one to really listen to reviews but everyone that has had a negative review for this film is RIGHT. Thank God I only rented it. What a stinker! I actually watched this film on fast forward (level 3). It really is bad; from the acting to the editing. Honestly and truly do not waste your money on this film unless you are having a theme movie night like we do here called ""You can spread it on crackers movie night""."
1,Lame of the Dead,"This movie is awful, awful, awful. NOT A ROMERO MOVIE, just more people capitalizing off of the francise. Quality is awful, story is even worse, bad acting, and so on and so on. The filmakers need to take back all copies of this film, put them in a box, and throw it in the ocean. In fact they should throw themselves in too."
2,Yikes,"I thought Ed Wood was dead. From the bad sets to even worse acting, this movie is not good. Since they only had the rights to the name Day of the Dead, they had to slap a number 2 on the end of the title and put this out. But if you are trying to tie this into the Romero films, this would be more like a prequel to Night of the Living Dead. There is some okay gore, but most of the special effects are very bad. Don't bother with this one."
1,Commits the deadly sin of being boring . . .,"Oh dear! After a slightly entertaining first five minutes (the inept special forces team and least gave me a few laughs as they 'contain' a hospital with their rather pathetic skills), the movie degenerates into a talkfest with dull characters doing amazingly dull things - but do we have an exciting finale? Well no! No no no no no. A few people falling on others and pretending to eat them. The lead characters doing nothing in particular. The lead bad guys doing nothing in particular. A few messy looking zombies that are ineffective because - gasp, the things they are doing are so tension free, relatively goreless and frankly dull.I'm sorry, folks, but the crime of dullness has been committed . . . this movie is found guilty on all fronts.I know. You're going to watch it anyway because it has zombies. But I tried to warn you, I really did."
1,Complete Drivel,"This movie was absolutley horrible. Like watching a soap opera. Bad acting, totally unoriginal, and gore? WHAT GORE?!? Now poor George Romero has to live with the fact that this film is concidered as ""paying homage"". Yeah right. I'm not going to talk about this movie at all cause there is nothing redeemable about it. You'll agree with me once you see it. Get Land Of The Dead and Undead because they are WAY better released than this stinker. This was a total cash in. Now I'm going to to try and cash in....look for my DVD of this on ebay. Skip this hardcore!"
1,Holy Moly!! No! No! No!,"This is by far one of the worst attempts at a zombie movie that I have seen. This is on par with War of the Dead as far as acting, Zombies and downright stupidity. I would rather watch Day of The Dead remake over and over again. Avoid, AVOID! AVOID!!"
1,THIS IS NOT A FILM IT IS NOTHING!,"this is not a film it is an utter waste of camera time , i wish i could have back the time it took to watch this disgrace."
3,"Ok, it wasnt totally bad","Got a copy for 2 bucks. I didnt expect anything at all. I actually got something. If you totally Ignore the title it isnt all bad. You got some alien thingy that transforms people into dead people. The makeup is ok, the gunfire is funny as heck. Lots of, well, some, gore. Remember, Ignore the titleeee Ignore the title and just watch it as a low budget title. I kind of wish they would have ended it differently but they didnt. It is worth the watch one time and if you can get it for cheap and ignore the title you will probably go away thinking, ok, it didnt suck."
1,"Pretty lame, Milhouse...","I had high hopes for this video tutorial, and am left quite disappointed. The topics covered are done in brief, five minute (+/-) vignettes with very limited explanation of the data and how it relates to the feature being discussed. Essentially, you receive narration on what you see (i.e.: ""now, I'll press this button and we can see that this feature opens..."").More a short guided tour of the software than anything leaning toward genuine instruction / explanation. Crystal Reports is a very powerful analytical tool, and this group of videos only serves to scratch the surface in a very brief, confusing way.If you expect to come away with anything more than only the most spotty and limited understanding of CR, keep looking."
3,"Good intro to step, but gets old pretty fast","This is a good routine for Beginners, especially those who want to start right off with a step routine. Learn the routine on the floor before starting to use the step. The steps are pretty basic and the correct form is taught. But the music and the routine itself get a bit boring after you've mastered the steps, even when you add the challenge of using the step ""bench"". It's not one that continues to challenge you once it's been learned. The abdominal routine at the end is too hard for Beginners who haven't been exercising for a while, but it will certainly build up those ab muscles quickly if done regularly. As always with step routines, be careful of doing them if you have knee, ankle, or balance problems."
2,"okay if your just beginning step, but not very challenging","To give this video credit, i suppose it would be alright if you had never tried step before, since the moves are all very basic. Actually i found the entire video rather boring. The music needs much improvement. I don't think I broke a sweat through this entire workout, and was feeling like I didn't get a sufficient workout at the end."
5,Thank you!,I really havent had the chance to watch the video because my vcr isnt working and I need ot buy a new one. but I believe I will be happy with it. Thanks
4,coordination needed,"I agree with some of the other reviewers in that this video is a good workout and the time goes quickly. However, I am both a beginner and not very coordinated... I find that by the time I figure out what the instructors are doing they have gone on to a different step. In those times, I just make up my own steps. The complicated (for me) steps keep me from rating this video higher."
5,good workout,"Jane Fondas workout gives me a good all around workout. Combines just enough change to make it interesting without boring you to death. Already used one up,needed to buy another one. Recommended for someone who wants a workout without having to go to dance class first."
5,Anyone seen this in DVD format?,"Great, excellent workout program, but has anyone seen this version in a DVD format?"
2,"good for beginners, but...","this is a good video to keep on hand if you're getting back in to excercise after vacation or being sick & need to work back into it slowly. It's very basic and loses it's challenge after a few times. It is a wonderful tape for somebody completely unfamiliar with stepping, though, since the routines are taught on the floor before bringing it up to the step. But in no way is this an intermediate/advanced video."
2,Ok for novices; not challenging for intermediate or advanced,"The step part is too simple and does not have enough moves to keep it interesting (you can only do basic step so many times before you look at the clock, you know?). The music is blah, and I lost interest quickly. The abdominal part is good and interesting, and I will keep it for that. I had much more fun at a gym step class than this one."
5,Love It!,"I love this work out! The step aerobics are great for any level, for you can adjust difficulty by arm movements, or higher step. I have been stepping for years and found this in a thrift store for only $1. Well yes it was well worth it. The moves are fun, and the ab routine at the end is really great!"
3,not for advanced steppers,"This would be a great workout for the people just beginning to step. The cueing is very easy to follow and the instructors take it pretty slow. On that note, I didn't find it very challenging and my heartrate just didn't get as high as it should have. Some of the parts are repititious and there is a lot of explantion for the beginner, making it difficult for those of us who want to skip the basics and get to sweating!!"
2,Looking for more instruction,"I had a hard time following steps because instructors are facing you. I would love it if you could see the steps from behind. Several times over many years I have taken out the stepper, try to follow the tape, then put it back in the attic again. If I could find a tape or cd where the instructor is not facing you but are turned around to were you are looking at their back, I would buy it."
5,Jane Fonda fan for years,"I've been using this video in addition to those of The Firm for the past 4 years. I consider it the best step video I've tried. It allows the exerciser to choose the level of intensity and increase it as fitness progresses. Initially, it takes a bit of concentration as the steps can be a bit tricky at first; however, once I got the steps down, I found that it was very enjoyable and not at all boring. The abdominal workout is fairly intense, but worth the time. Give it a try..... You won't be disappointed!"
1,no product received,"I am extremely sorry to inform you that neither I received this product ,nor the seller bothered to inform me that he would not sending me the product.Amazon.com takes no resposibility in the deal .I really dont understand why such sellers are allowed to sell their products at their siteHarrased customer"
5,A classic!,"I started this routine shortly after it came out. I still use it today. I know most of the words by heart and can use the routine with my mp3 player - no video.I like the variety in the class, the change of the music, and the change of instuctors. I have to admit, when I'm pressed for time, I skip the warm up and cool down, and only sometimes do the ab part, but the aerobic part of this video is very productive without making anyone turn and twist when tired which is so dangerous!This is my favorite of every workout I have ever tried."
2,Belkin F8V301,"Haven't yet used the cable being reviewed here,thus the 2 star rating.Bought it as a backup or test cable only. the quality is roughly the same as the cables supplied with most video components in the box. Not bad for the money I guess.Normal shipping as expected from Amazon."
1,Don't buy it!,The lid on the sandbox is basically worthless. It never stays on in even the slightest wind and doesn't fit on it. We found that out too late. It had already rained and the water collected in the sandbox and had algae growing in it by the time we realized the lid had leaked. Not worth the money spent at all!!
1,Bad lid design,I have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the lid. Our sandbox always has water in it after it rains. It is a hassle and my daughter doesn't understand why she can't play in it. I have contacted Little TIkes and they are suppose to send me a credit voucher. Definitely pick out another sandbox.
4,Great Little Sandbox,"We had a really rainy summer and despite what the other reviews say, the lid fits fine--it doesn't leak at all. This has been a great little sandbox for my son."
1,Not what I had hoped for,"While it appears the intention of the authors of this book were good, the book and it's companion Lernheft leave much to be desired. They are filled with obvious mistakes, inconsistencies and very confusing sections. As a returning, older university student, I expected more from a textbook than I received from this book. Most of my fellow students are of traditional university age and the long references to World War II and other historical eras are just not interesting to them. I am one of the only students who remembers the removal of the Berlin Wall! Having struggled with this book for three semesters, I am happy to say the department has chosen a new textbook combination for the current and following semesters. I would NOT recommend these books for any students (especially beginners) of the german language."
4,Good Adventure Story,"If you have seen the movies, you will find many interesting differences in the books upon which they are based. James Bond is much more vulnerable and not nearly as sinister as Sean Connery portrayed him. Honey Rider is a much more complex character. Her beauty is flawed by a broken nose caused when she was raped. The movie softens this in a way that takes away from understanding her character. Dr. No is much more menacing. This book is not great literature but it is a worthwhile diversion."
5,Principles of Genetics,Book came on time!!! There is highlighting already in the book which helps!! The book is not even half as bad as the seller said it was. It looks brand new! I'm passing this class!!! Thanks!
2,Boring and not comprehensive,This book can be utterly insipid and tedious to read. The illustrations are not helpful and main ideas are not presented clearly.
2,Psychotic,Someone was on some serious acid when they decided to A. Come up with the idea. B. Convince someone else (probably also on acid) to put up the money for it & finally C. Convince the actresses to do this cause it will blow your mind. It actually made my head hurt to watch it. Plenty of chunky nudity & a lesbian scene or 2. I cant remember. That's how weird it was.
1,"GSM Networks: Protocols, Terminology and Implementation","Dear,We have not received the book GSM Networks: Protocols, Terminology and Implementation (Artech House Mobile Communications) (Purchased on 21/10/2011).Request information if in fact this book has already been sent and was received at CESAR, what is the name of the person you received?Rogerio Ferreira"
2,Didn't Notice Any Difference,"I know plenty of people love this supplement, however it didn't help my issues at all. I have possible Habba symptoms/IBS D/Who Knows What and these were just additional pills I was taking without results. Seller was fast and condition was good."
1,DOSEN'T WORK DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I question the validity of where the positive comments are really coming from. I was a little reserved about this product after reading the reviews that this stuff was a miracle cure for diarrhea, but thought I'd give it a try. It has done absolutely nothing to help even slightly relieve my diarrhea I think it may have even made it a little worse actually. I even ordered more directly from the company thinking it needed more time to work still no difference. I followed their dosing directions and everything. If this was really a good treatment or cure it would be hailed by most with IBD as a great miracle but, it is not. Read the FDA letter about the company making claims about its product. I hope the FDA checks into this company more. BUYER BEWARE. I WISH I HAD MY MONEY BACK."
4,Yes!,"These are pretty awesome. Very good bass, and audio quality in general is high. Only problem is that they're really fragile - unlike other headphones in the shape, this one bends slightly in, which can also take some getting used to. On my second pair, but they're still the best of low-priced headphones I've used."
2,"New, but not better","They were uncomfortable with the plastic frame squeezing my head just ahead of my ears. There seems to be a trend to try to ""float"" the phones over your ears. I didn't give them a listen initially because they were just plain uncomfortable. They relaxed some after sitting in the car (I guess 100 degree plus weather is good for something) and I was able to give them a listen.The sound is veiled and vocals are moved to the background. The sound quality noticeably lags the Philips HS500's and HS820's. This is the second SHS series phone that I gave a low rating because of sound quality. Check out my cumulative ratings under Philips HS820.The strangest thing about these phones is when I turn my head; I hear a ""zizzing"" noise. I turned down the volume and it is still there. They aren't rubbing on anything so I haven't figured out what is causing the noise. Never had phones do this. Weird!This goes on my ""don't buy it because there are better phones"" list."
1,Great... if you have a huge head,"I got these expecting them to be of good quality because they are made by Phillips, but boy was I wrong. I was so happy to receive them; I immediately ripped open the package and put them on my head. As soon as I had put them on, I had to take them off. They were awful! They did not fell right at all. They twist in on your head and are horribly uncomfortable. I have an average size head and didn't ever think this would be a problem. My husband said they were fine, but my kids agreed with me. I got these to replace the ear buds because those won't stay in my ear, but after I got them I went back to my ear buds and returned them as soon as possible. These may be good for men, but I would not recommend them for women or children."
3,Good for the price,"A pretty good headphone for the price. It does ""float"" around the ears and the frame of the headphone does rub against the back of my neck - causing a bit of discomfort from time to time while I am sitting down. Overall, I am pleased with the the value - if I wanted to $100 headphone quality, I would not buy this one but this works just fine for gym, office, and general usage (and I will not go heart-broken if I lost/broke this headphone)."
3,Decent for its price,Picked them up for $12.99 from Best Buy. The bass is better than the stock ipod headphones for sure. You do look kind of dork while wearing them but good for the price.
2,Needs less personal stories,"I wasn't impressed with this book and bummed that I bought it. There were a few tidbits of solid historical evidence and way too much personal anecdotes. The author even included multiple stories of things his friends had told him. And what's with all the self reflection? I want to know about Jesus and where he walked, not about the author's life or questions about my own, let me figure that one out. I don't recommend this at all."
3,"Looks good, fits so,so","I ordered a pair of these to replace a broken one. You push down on the upper tabs and up on the lower tab to remove the mirrors covers. The new lenses have a plug on a cable so you have to stuff that into any space you can. The price is right the look is good. I guess they could fit a little better but I would buy another pair. Shipping was very fast, Amazon does a good job. I love free shipping. Thanks Amazon."
4,Recon LED side mirror lens-Ford Super Duty,"Ordered these Recon replacement lenses for my truck to replace a cracked factory Ford lens. The dealer wanted 160. per side, so obviously, at 90 for the pair these lenses represent a great value. There are 4 tabs that need to be released, (the instructions only call out 3) but replacement was easy, and straightforward. The lenses fit like factory, and the smoke tint looks much better than the factory yellow. Awesome deal, great value, fast shipping from Amazon, and I saved 70 bucks. What's not to like?"
3,Recon side mirror LED lights for Ford SuperDuty,"Received the lights very fast, thanks Amazon. The lights themselves look good, however the fit was so-so. Really had to work to get them into the mirror housing. Fit was close but needed to heat the retention tabs to bend them enough to lock in place. The stock light has a connector built into the housing, these have cables then the connector, so you have to be careful when squeezing in the added bulk in the available space. It does fit, you just have to be careful when snapping the housing back on. There are 6 LEDs on the stock lights, the Recon has 4 LEDS, but the brightness is about the same. Would have given it 4 stars, but based on the fitment issues, giving it a 3, expected a better fit based on the price."
4,Best double stroller available,"I've had this stroller for 3 years now. My kids are 18 mos apart. It has been fantastic. It steers well and my 4.5 year old still likes to ride in it and he's 75th percentile for height.The con is the front sun shade isn't really high enough, but we don't use them anyway. I took the sunshade off my bugaboo frog too.The only other issue we've had is now that my boys are both 35lbs it does seem to sometimes tip when I turn tight corners, but this wasn't a problem until more recently.I find the storage basket plenty sufficient but I'm not a carry the kitchen sink with me. It has the most and easiest access of my 3 strollers."
4,"Great stroller, considering the competition!","We bought this stroller in September 2006, one of the first available in the US. I had a single Maxi-Cosi 4 wheel drive stroller and LOVED it. I thought there would be something similar on the market for a double. No such luck!One of those crappy Graco doubles doesn't hold a candle to this stroller. My neighbor has a new Zooper Tango and it sags in the center, really bad. Who has room in their car for a double jogger? and the side by sides barely fit through the door of a store.This baby turns on a dime and is great for zipping around the racks of stores and going off road at the park.This stroller has a couple of flaws, but they are far outweighed by the abilty for this stroller to maneuver around town. Flaw #1 the child in the front can kick the wheel lock and that's a pain in the rear. Flaw#2 once your kids are a little taller, the sun shades are virtually useless. We haven't used them for a long time."
2,Uneven and haphazardly done,"Very disappointed in this book. Have the House Book by Phaidon and love it. This one is pretty poor. Many of the gardens are credited to the building architect in the listing, tho the garden designer is mentioned in the text. Ex: Look up Frank Gehry; he's listed for the garden even tho the landscape architect is mentioned in the text. There are others like that, too. Wha?? For some of the gardens, the photo chosen is not the thing highlighted in the text. I think this book just lacks really good and tight editing by someone who actually cares about garden design."
3,Laid Back Blues Rock From 1989.,"Eric Clapton has been at the top of the tree since the mid 1960s, since which he has covered many genres of music, however in his heart he loves the blues best.For me Bad Love is the best track, this includes support from Phil Collins, on other songs Robert Cray, Jim Keltner and George Harrison help out.Not his greatest album, but blues rock fans are likely to enjoy it."
4,one of my favorites from Clapton,"Eric Clapton is a true legend. An amazing guitarist, songwriter, singer, historian, and crucial member of several Hall of Fame worthy bands. I saw the Journeyman tour twice in 1989/90 and those were great concerts, and that may influence my opinion, he was on fire that year. Journeyman is a great Clapton album and I'd put it up there with Layla, the Cream albums, his self-titled ""solo"" album, and Slowhand. If you are a Claptonhead and don't have Journeyman, you should get it ASAP. Stinging blues, soaring pop, and the riff of bad Love is just awesome.Standout tracks: Pretending, Bad Love, Anything For Love, Running on Faith, Before You Accuse Me"
3,The Comeback Album?,"Refusing to be relegated into classic rock history, Clapton comes out with a very modern, revamped sound. The result is Journeyman, and, for the most part, it does not dissapoint. There is a lot to suggest that Clapton has matured not only as a player but as a songwriter as well. There are songs of betrayal and loss in a kind of middle aged sensibility. And the playing on here is very polished and professional. This also happens to be the drawback of this album. Most of Clapton's solo work has been slightly underproduced and understated, lending itself to a soulful approach. The standout songs here are Pretending, Old Love and Bad Love. Given his career, there are much better albums, but this one will do for the casual fan, with a limited range of Clapton knowledge."
3,before you accuse me,"Clapton's abilities as a studio musician shine here, but the album dates itself with 80's clap-track (Anything for Your Love) and the sounds of solid state amplifiers. Old Love, Pretending, No Alibis, Bad Love and Before you Accuse Me are all cult favorites for Clapton fans. Lets face it, 461 Ocean Boulevard is his weakest album and it's still awesome. This album rates better in my book, but not his best effort. Too much doo-wop girls and over-production, which again shows its ugly head on the albums Pilgrim and Reptile. Still, Clapton can write and play and somehow manage to put out a good album, regardless of your recording tastes."
2,Got to learn the secret handshake first,"Rather than just leave monuments all over the world saying, ""hey, this is what is about to happen to us, and the same will eventually happen to you"", an advanced civilization 10,000 years ago decided to leave the warning in such a cryptic way, using astrology adjusted for precession, etc, that no one in their right mind would take it seriously. To me that says that no such message was left, and is merely the product of a living imagination. Yet another book which takes catastrophe and tries to get it to behave by making it periodical and predictable."
5,"If you like whales, you'll like this book","If you want detailed information on whales, dolphins and porpoises layed out in a consistant, logical way with beautifully drawn, color images, this is the book for you.Some of the detailed information includes maps of where the animals typically range, a profile of their dive sequences for whale watchers and a comparison profile against a 6ft tall man. This is for each and every animal in the book and only part of the information included.This is a real gift to whale lovers and whale watchers everywhere. I can't really see anyone being dissapointed in a purchase of this book."

4,Provocative,"Kurosaki is bold enough to basically say, enough is enough; all Christians should love one another. Too bad we don't listen to him. This is a short read with a bold message. I recommend it."
2,dont know why these are rated so high.,"In order for my recorder to record these disc's ( my recorder specifies Maxwell DVD-RW)I FIRST had to have them formated via Burnaware ( a pc DVD burner)then had to reformat them again on did not work... To take a disc from the spindle and put it into the DVD recorder created nothing but a ""cant record on this Disc""... Upon loading it immediately formatted -then the Error Code E4 appeard.I tried several ways of erasing and formatting before I found this process.So if you get a spindle of discs that when loaded immediately goes into format and then the Error Code E4 appears, try this process.. The PC program Burnaware is a free download. It takes me 35 minutes each disc to prepare.Hope this saves you some unusable discs."
3,watch the outside of the discs,"dont take my comment wrong because it is a very good product , but the outside of 3-4 discs look "" a bit "" i cant think of the word, im sorry. but ill use jagged. they are history. you call this place (maxell twice ) , no return call. i put in a TDK AND THEN A MEMOREX and they were perfect and we watch them on our dvd player. i had a small bit ofa problem w/ memorex on 1 dvd blank media and that fine , but the maxell didnt work out for me at all. plus you only get 15. the maxell 15 pack sold for $ 13.00 or so for 15...watch for a sale on TDK. BUT,that's only my opinion.... don barajas"
1,Somethings wrong with www.amazon.com title?,"WWW.amazom.com shown in Product Description (4.7 GB- 2 hours - 10,000 read/write cycles - Supports 1x-24x write speeds - Quick formatting - Sequential & random access recording - Full playback compatibility - 50-year archival life- Includes jewel cases- 15-pk spindle). But I can only write in maximum (4x) speed.Somethings wrong with amazon or Maxell?"
3,Maxell 634046 Rewtitable DVD + RW,I haven't had the opportunity to try these yet. I am disappointed that the maximum recording time is purportedly two hours.
2,Rewritable DVD blanks...,These Maxell Rewritable DVD+RW (15-Pack)are far superior than the DVD-RW.So far so good...I've no complaints.Thanks Again...Mark
2,Convoluted,"I was required to purchase this book for a class, and I must say that it is by far one of the worst textbooks that has ever been foisted upon me.BDM seems to take great joy in turning very simple, very obvious concepts into extremely convoluted, over-bloated metaphors with PLENTY of self-referential citation thrown in for good measure.The book is difficult to follow at times. I found myself frequently re-reading paragraphs to make sure I wasn't missing something important, because the concepts that he took four pages to explain couldn't POSSIBLY be as simple as I was understanding them to be, right?! Wrong. They ARE that simple, and most of the text in this book is essentially pointless.In short, use the glossary in this book if you must, and take notes from that. At least that way you can avoid most of the self-adulation and long-windedness."
2,Boring as hell,"I had to use this textbook for my world politics class and hardly learned anything. The book is incredible boring and just unnecessarily complicates things with vocabulary and mathematical models. Also the chapters are really lengthy, and its easy to lose focus on the subject at hand."
1,Book Review,This book uses terrible examples and does a very poor job of explaining concepts. The book throws tons of theories at readers however none ever take human nature into account. The book is dry and revolves around Mezquita's computer models and how he wants to predict future events. Very self-righteous and pretty biased. All in all a really bad text book.
4,Very Good Book,"I think that this book is very good because it details the experiences of someone who was at Columbine and how her faith helped see her through what happened.However, I think this book's main weakness is that the author does sound slightly self-righteous at times and I don't think that this is a book is suitable for anyone who wants to learn more about what happened at Columbine on 4/20/99.This is a great book about someone who survived what happened at Columbine and I would definitely recommend it, especially to anyone who is a Christian."
5,I want Moore!,Gary Moore is one of the greatest guitarists in the world and this concert showcases the vast skills at his disposal. Very polished performance all round with an unforgettable version of Friday on my Mind! With ex-Rainbow bassist Bob Daisley and future Kiss drummer Eric Singer this is a must see!
2,battery no good,"it is nice to have a car and wall charger for this product, however the battery does not stay charged for longer than a few hours."
4,Good Stuff!,"Another great book by Robert Schuller that focuses on exactly what the title says. Gives some great ways to boost your confidence and lots of good advice on being a more positive person. Written in an easy to read style, it's by far one of the best books I've read on the subject."
5,This book changed my life!,"Not hyperbole, but the truth. My father had a copy of this book in his library. Stumbling upon this book was probably the best thing that's ever happened to me. Reading the stories the author presents can't help but motivate you to pursue your dream. It's not preachy -- and not too religious -- it's just a great book that is easy to read, and will inspire you to achieve success.Because of this book, I decided to leave the engineering world behind and pursue my dreams of being an animator / cartoonist. I'm MUCH happier now than I ever have been, and it's all because of being inspired by the stories of success in this book. Taking the first step in any radical change is the toughest -- but this book is by your side, and will help you along the way. Highly recommended."
3,Kindle version suffers (as is sometimes the case),"This rating is no reflection on the quality or veracity of Pope's translation of this unmissable masterpiece, but is only a warning to you Kindle readers who are browsing through the various Iliad options. The text in the introduction is formatted improperly almost like verse and renders it practically unreadable. The actual text of the translation is, however, formatted much better. So depending on whether you care about the substantial introductory material, you may find this to be a non-issue. Also, there is no Table of Contents, which anyone would be hard pressed to ignore. However, as this is an important translation and it is relatively inexpensive, I would recommend that you not disregard it, but please try a sample first."
1,"Great content, badly kindle-formatted.","Considering the previous reviews were all about the content of this book (which of course is fantastic, since it's Pope's Iliad), I want to add a review of the kindle formatting.-- Which is terrible --- no verse formatting, so the lines run into each other- no section navigation between books- the note markers are left in, without links to the actual notes!- references to illustration are in the text, but the illustrations are missingThe author seems to have taken the free content from the Gutenberg Project (google it) and removed the helpful formatting, navigation, and images. Go there to get a better, illustrated, and free version of Pope's Iliad for your kindle."
4,Great Book Poorly Printed,"Pope's translation is excellent, and the story is a great one. However, I am a little disappointed because the quality of the copy I received is poor. The print is very faint or patchy in a lot of places. In some places whole words are missing."
5,Homer with a baroque tunic,"I read this translation a couple of years ago, and greatly enjoyed it. I will admit that the perpetual rhyme scheme, typical of Pope, did gradually lose its charm for me. But then, that's the way Pope wrote! Nonetheless, a powerful translation of this great classic, and well worth reading. 5 stars: If Homer doesn't deserve them, nobody does!"
5,Compelling translatio9n,"Despite the some time ""sing-song"" translation, I think the Pope translation is the best one i've read - with all the gore and sex and awful gods, it is a treat."
5,Homer and Pope,"What can I say... The Iliad, of which so many of us are afraid, is one of the greatest stories told! Everything is there: grand battles, individual deaths, anger, love, jealousy, honor, betrayal. One can understand why so many good writers went on to mine its many treasures. Alexander Pope's translation, as highly recommended in an essay in The New Yorker by Daniel Mendelsohn (Nov. 2011), is gorgeous. Please, read it!"

1,Wrong title,"The title should be ""how to ask right questions for a bible study"". The whole book was about asking questions in referance to the bible passages. Which is fine but it does not help with conversations outside of a bible study. So if you need guidelines with conversations for real life conversations then buy a different book."
5,A Must For Every Discussion Leader,"I can't say enough good things about Karen Lee Thorp's booklet on How to Ask Great Questions, and I've loaned it out or recommended it to many people. It's a short read, well organized, and easily absorbed.For teachers, discussion leaders, and book writers who want to ignite better learning and transformation in class, small group, or book club participants (and who find the typical small group study guide questions somehow inadequate for the goal), you'll learn why certain questions fall flat while others provoke passionate commentary.After reading this book, you should have no problem coming up with your own excellent discussion questions. Although I've grasped the fundamental lesson of this book, I like to keep it close by so that when I get stuck planning a group exploration of a topic I can quickly get back on track."
3,good product,"This is an interesting product, it works real well for what it is, allowing movement of music off of your ipod and additional outlook syncronizations. I am actually shocked itunes has not adopted the functionality into itunes (owned the produce for a year already), it would make their offering much better."
1,Bad,"The product package (not the shipping package) arrived open, looks like somebody opened it and returned it before. Seller claims it's manufacturer's defect.Not safe. It has a lot of air bubbles in the material (kinda like air trapped in glass), which will cause the ball to stretch unevenly under pressure and burst easily. The center seam looks rough, too.No way to select the color. Online picture shows a blue, I got a hot pink. My boy cannot play it. This is not ""colors may vary"", this is drastically different."
1,Won't charge - less than a week old,The unit was received as a gift for Christmas. It refused to charge at first but finally the light came on and it seemed to take a charge. A few days later it was dead and will not charge. Panasonic customer service was worse than awful as was their web site when trying to complain about customer service.
4,Bluetooth enable your iPod,"If you want to bluetooth enable your iPod, this adapter is a good way to accomplish it. It securely attaches to your iPod so you don't have to worry about it accidentally coming over. Its reliable, doesn't seem to consume too much battery power from the iPod and syncs very easily to my Motorokr S9 bluetooth headset."
5,Likeable Langenscheidt's,This dictionary is really very handy. I use it when I am reading brain candy. It has had most of the words in there that I need. The ones that I find are not in there are obscure words like pater. The book is small enough to fit in a backpack and it's well made. Print is very good and so is the layout. I am very happy with this dictionary.
5,Very Cool,"This dictionary is the absolute best for students. When I was High School, I would use this for my vocab list all the time and I loved it! Since the book is so small, it takes half the time to find what you are looking for, and the definitions are short, sweet, and to the point...like this review, bye bye!"
4,this is hard and i love it,"dude, i listen to punk music and wear eyemake-up and tight jeans - pretty much i look like someone B.G. and people who like his music would beat up but I LOVE THIS cd. its so hard and makes this white boy feel straight GANGSTA ... i might even buy a jersey and mob on the corner this summer (but no dope slangin', i'd be no good locked up in the pen) cause this cd got me inspired to make something outta my life!!! Thanks for something refreshing to listen to this summer ... BELIEVE IT"
3,"pretty good, but not the best from b.gizzle","This album was well rounded with some alot of good tracks, however b.gizzle is a exceptional artist. his work is usually so far ahead of others that there is no comparison, however this time his cd is at average, this is not what i expected the album to be. however its still better than alot of the garbage that is being called music out there. so by it, you wont be disappointed, just not as satisfied as other b.gizzle albums."
3,this is cool for today...,"this album is the coolest, dopest, hard hittin jamz this week,yeah, this week. itz definately not a classic but itz cool fa tha moment. but yo, ya be one lackin fan of the former CMR click if ya didnt cop this record. it'll make ya want to go out, get bent ,act a fool at ya babys mamas and go jack somebody fa their government check so be careful bcuz right here bg getz pretty intense. i definately recommend this album fa all the real g'z who are livin tha ghetto life bcuz this will definately not go mainstream purely bcuz of itz subject matter. enuff said. DJSIRLEXX"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"In a sense, my review is unfair. This is an entertaining book with a unique perspective on first contact. From another author I might have given it 4 stars. But I had hope for more.Other reviewers have detailed the two threads of the story, from both the human and ""alien"" perspective. I never really got the subtitle ""A Scientific Romance"" -- perhaps it is supposed to reflect the romance of travel and discovery. I note that it now seems to be subtitled ""A novel of first contact.""Although the story moves along well enough, it has a very weak ending (as did Engine City). I had hoped that Newton's Wake heralded a revitalized Macleod (I couldn't put down the books in the Fall Revolution series), but I ended up disappointed.Well worth reading, but don't get your hopes up."
4,Learning the world,"This book was a little differnt than the usual scifi first contact story. The story focus on the instellar starship But the sky,my lady! The sky! and its inhabiants and what happens when they fnally run into other intelligent life after 4000 years of travel. There are some interesting ideas in the book about what would happen if a generation of people used to always being plugged in suddenly had that taken away, along with suddenly losing their purpose in life due to running into a planet they couldn't colonize.The book is a little out there with the techno babble and dealing with stuff that doesnt exist. But it does look at some interesting ideas a little differntly.This book does remind me of another called Ship of Fools by Richard Paul Russo. Not as dark but dealing with some of the same ideas. All in all a good read."
4,Good first contact story,"This is a standard piece of ""first contact"" science fiction. I don't think there was anything outstandingly original in the story, but it did keep me up last night reading the whole thing straight through. I agree with the reviewer who thought the characters were a bit flat, but I did think the aliens were well done. I recommend this book to any compulsive reader of science fiction."
3,Just OK,It was just OK for me. Lots of common sense and filler. Most sales books have the same format...and this is one more.
3,Good advice,This book is helpful in putting structure around a referral program. We'll be implementing many of this book's suggestions.
2,Lacks depth,"After reading the masterly work of Baucknam on Jude, I thought all the books in the series were similar. I was dissappointed. There is nothing extra. The greek analysis was okay, but that was all. No discussion on the historical, archeological material or the customs of that day. No comparison of scripture or how verses are linked to other parts of the bible..It wasn't what I wanted, but it may be okay for others"
2,Big disappointing!,"I'm a big Texas fan, but this album stinks! Mind you, I was expecting something as good as White on Blonde and the Hush. This album doesn't flow like the other two and feels rather uninspired. I'd have to say, I hate the added the R&B and rap insertions, I think this trend of adding R&B to pop songs is getting old. There is not a single song I liked on this entire album and not one song stood out as even remotely catchy."
4,Interestingly Amazing,"After listening to this album several times I'm still not sure how I feel about it. If you are looking for an album with musical variety you have found it! The music is extremely catchy and perfect for anyone who enjoys many different styles of music. The reason this album only earns 4 stars from me is the lead vocalist's (Sharleen Spiteri) voice is drowned out and muddled on several of the tracks (Broken, & Big Sleep to name a few). This was disappointing to me as her vocals are always the crowning glory of any Texas album. All in all this is an extremely decent album. To be truthful, the more I hear it, the more I enjoy it. Happy listening."
4,Interesting mix,"Texas have always been musical magpies, and this collection is as different from ""Hush"" as ""White On Blonde"" was from ""Mothers Heaven"". Hints of Blondie, Bacharach and No Doubt sit comfortably side by side, all linked together by Sharleen's vulnerable vocals.It's all very listenable, but ultimately not quite as memorable as ""White On Blonde""."
4,It was good but not great,"The first half of the CD I really enjoyed and it was catchy, but near the end it sounded like they were desparate to fill the CD so they added almost anything. I still don't understand how carnival girl got into the CD considering Sharleen Spiteri said that the album is more rock... hmmm... I still gave it a 4 star coz it's still better than most CDs out there."
2,Cathy's Concepts Sparkling Entwined Ring pillow,"Not happy with item. Poorly made, but beautiful design. Designs are stuck on the pillow and are all loose. I thought it was embroidered on the fabric, but the design has an adhesive back. I will have to anchor it all with hand stitching if I want to keep it since it matches the candle I got."
5,very good gloves,"I'm a film lighting technician and these gloves really fit my needs when it comes to handling hot lights etc. they are well constructed and fit well much better than leather which lose their shape over time. they also handle the heat, i can comfortably hold hot items for a reasonable period and the gloves dissipates the heat after I let go. I have had them for a month and I hope they are durable"
3,Nice gloves but too small,"These are nice gloves, and they're great for working with excessive hot metal. The problem is they run smaller than most gloves. I tend to wear a size Large, but with these it's damn near impossible to get them on. If you order them, just make sure you order a size up from normal."
2,GOOD BUT !!!!!!!!!,"the gloves are good because they are made of good material which prevents cuts and abrasion BUT I suggest not touching anything hot because it cannot stand more than 2 seconds of holding a hot object, therefore they do not withstand the suggested temperature."
2,This Player Sucks and So Does The Customer Service,"I purchased this in January, 2007 and my PC refuses to recognize the flash device. I contacted customer service and they were hard to reach. The one e-mail response I got only included a copy of the instruction manual. Since I had already exhausted all the options in the manual this was not helpful. I have players, a RCA and another Coby, the other Coby has the same problem even though it's a more expensive product with more memory and options. My RCA still works great. Avoid this product, it is hard to keep working and reprogram. Since I purchase and use a lot of PC equipement and help others with their stuff, I am very well informed. I recommend skipping this product, it's not worth the cheap price. Since my brother gave me the other Coby at the same as a gift, at least I am not out the price of two useless players."
5,EVERYONE WITH A PULSE SHOULD HAVE THIS INFORMATION TODAY.,"I have told everyone I care about to become aware of this information.The facts presented in this book are both UNBELIEVABLE and IRREFUTABLE.If you have the desire to become TRULY INFORMED aboutvaccinations' and their HORRIFIC DANGERS, purchase this book. You'll not beable to put it down, and you'll immediately want to PASS IT ON TO OTHERS.What you'll read is no less that SHOCKING.You owe it to yourself and your family to read THIS one immediately.There is no question in my mind that this book deserves to be a #1 best seller, but the politics won't allow this to happen. There's too much profit in promoting thisshameful and dangerous agenda. Bottom Line: Get this book. You WON'T be sorry."
1,An amazing view into paranoid delusions,"There just isn't space to detail all of the errors, inaccuracies, distortions and outright falsehoods contained in this book. It would be easier to describe what this book has RIGHT, which is largely limited to the author's name. If you read this book, you would be better off - and more well-informed - if you simply assumed that the truth was the OPPOSITE of what the author writes."
4,Good ideas.,Great ideas. It ended up to not be exactly what I was looking for but stimulated creativity.
5,"Best birthdays, ever!","I have had this book for years and was able to give my daughter the best and most creative birthday parties I could imagine. I just ordered this book for a friend with two small children as she was searching for fun and economic ideas for their celebrations. My daughter had 6 parties; the cheerleader party was one of my favorites, and the bicycle birthday with neighborhood parade is still talked about 15 years later! Buy this book and make great memories!"
2,A good start but not for informed readers,This is a bad book in that it only covers a few ships out of a few major navies of the world it only book mentions things about different classes of ships but then never explains how the changes were done. Which leaves the reader with no idea of how a warship weapons system operates.This book would be good in a child's library but not in an person with an interest in naval systems. In short don't buy this book if you want to see a majority of the type of ships in a modern navy. Buy Jane's.
5,A Childhood Favorite,"As a child, I was facinated by they different ways in which people live. This book shows readers in simple, eloquent text and illustration a way of life quite different from the way most Americans live. In doing so, it shows the universality of human living. For very young children, Come Over to My House by Theo LeSieg (aka Dr. Seuss) does the same."
5,GREAT Vest!,"I bought this for my little nephew to play Special Forces, but when I saw it out of the package I must admit I wanted it for myself. Appears to be made well and has LOTS of handy pockets."
4,Great vest used as Halloween costume,"We purchased this vest for a Hawkeye Halloween costume for my 10 yr old son. The medium size was a little large for him, but still fit him well enough (which is exactly what I would prefer so that we can use it for future occasions). There are various types of pockets all over the front, and there are some loops on the back. The material is close to a canvas feel, so it wouldn't provide much warmth. This vest worked well for the Halloween costume - although I'm not sure when he'll ever wear it again. It would probably work well on a camping or fishing trip."
2,Lacking in details,"I was really looking forward to this tome. However, a very limited introduction at best. Considering the price for a softcover, not worth the effort. I really have enjoyed Jim Teeny articles and etc. This effort would have been a lot better as a pocket book. I managed to read this book at one sitting and don't really feel that I learned much of anything new or useful."
1,Much ado about simple attention to detail,"There isn't really a Jim Teeny Technique, just a collection of tips. Get the fly down to the fish, use shot on the leader if allowed and required, note pocket water as best areas, don't spook the fish, flog any place that hold fish, watch for takes, don't fish with less than 8lb tippet (but had a good day using 4lb on the page before that). I'm sure Jim Teeny's reputation as a persistent and successful angler is true but this book is just a quick read."
5,Oddworld,"Highly recommended. I have read all of Thomson's books, except ""Soft"", and found that his first 2 (""Dreams"" and ""5 Gates"") are his best. What seems to work is the off-kilter realism of the characters combined with the surrealism of the setting (a coast town based on the funeral business in ""5 Gates"" and a town no one is allowed to leave in ""Dreams"") and stories. ""5 Gates"" is an eerie read where you always feel submerged in the dreamy water-world of Moon Beach or its surrounding deserts where things mostly move in slow motion until drawn to a quick conclusion."
