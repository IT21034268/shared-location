2,"well written, but bizarre intertwining with tv episode","I do not know who (jms or the author) is responsible for the decision for books 2 and 3 of this series to closely interweave and usually re-write the significance of events in the tv series (in this book the season 2 ep. geometry of shadows is the main one), but I think a very good story from this theme could have been written without. so now the events in Geometry of Shadows have completely different meaning, including Sheridan knowing about the false departure tactic and aiding it, londo's apology being a trick from morden, and most annoyingly the fact sheridan saw the departure vessel explode, something WE didn't see.I don't know why this sort of tactic for writing this story is used. 4 stars for quality of writing, negative 2 stars for the episode tie-in tactic. I posted a similar note on novel 3 in this series."
5,Unbelievably beautiful,"Mr. Silvestri has proven himself a staggeringly gifted composer with the gorgeous music from the movie Contact. The recurring theme moves me to tears. The music is a timely and fitting memorial to the late Carl Sagan and his dreams and the dreams of all of us and our hopes for the future of humankind. Bravo, Alan Silvestri!"
4,Good but not great,"There is so much going on on the screen, so much to watch and listen to, so much to think about, that you don't listen to the music. Finally, when you get a chance to hear Alan Silvestri's orchestration, on the end credits, it is such a beautiful arrangmement of the strings and gentle piano. It's good, but not great, though it is very enjoyable and easy on the ears. I give it my recommendation."
4,The Perfect Souvenir,"Movie scores, at their best, should be like little souvenirs of the films they are for. And CONTACT is a perfect example. While the music does run stylistically close to Silvestri's own FORREST GUMP, it nicely nails everything it needs to do dramatically and emotionally. Not to mention that you are not likely to find a more thrilling cue than 'GOOD TO GO'."
3,A good score.,"Alan Silvestri as done much better than this.Even so,i like it very much cause i'm his fan."
3,A Piece of Work Taken for Granted,"After watching the movie Contact and then listening to the soundtrack, I was delighted to hear just how much the music added to the entire film. Contact, which spoke to contact on so many levels from father-daughter, science-religion, man-woman, terrestrial-extraterrestrial, also spoke to the new contact between film and music. The soundtrack was as essential to the complete enjoyment of the movie as was the acting of Jodie Foster or the plot by Carl Sagan.Definitely a must for any Contact lover."
2,Just OK,"This tool is just OK for starting the screw removal process. You still need a pait of pliers to finish off the job.Not easy to use, but if you have to get a one-way screw out, I don't think there is an easier way.Helps get the job started, but not done."
2,Didn't work on older one way screws,"Ordered this to remove some one way screws on some locks around the house.The screws probably hadn't been turned in 20-30 years, and this tool was not up to the task. MIGHT work on screws that are just barely snug.Had to use a dremel and notch a head and remove that way. Actually went pretty quick once set up. Wasted money."
3,cheezie.but fun,"This one remains my favorite among the cheesie catagory.Its filled with bad effects,acting and costume.Low budget and hilarious entertaining.Creatures covered with eyes terrorize a small town and the army is called.The only movie where headlights are used to destroy the creatures.John ashley stars in this ridiculous romp.The director in my version forgot that there was a fly in the room and filmed it."
1,Get the Novicane ready !,"Feel like getting numb to dumb movies? Numb yerself folks cause its going to be a looooong night watching this ham fest of bad movies.The writer before me took the time to go over this in great detail{i wonder if he is in therapy? I know I would be}Its filled with horrible acting,cheesy sets,and phony monsters.The one man isn't effected at all about hearing the death of his roomate?!? Can't blame him though thats one obnoxious crappy actor out of the way.Oh Marlon Brando daid it best in Apocalypse Now.....The Horror! Yes the horror of spending 80 minutes watching this dribble! Headlights kill the monsters! I wished the monsters had killed everybody on the set and put em out their misery or mine!"
2,Not Bad Not Good,"Yes, i know its bad, but ive seen even worse...much worse.If you like classic no budget science fiction movies from the50 then you should add this one to your collection...butbuy it second had...the price they want for a bad movie is justtooooooo much."
1,HUH?,"Does no one recognize this really bad made-4-TV movie as a remake of the 1956 Roger Corman quickie ""It Conquered the World"" with Peter Graves?"
3,"Nice, but...","Several fittings privided but only the foam ear ""plug"" fittings seem to work for me. Unfortunately they will wear down in time and I will likey have to get a new set. Everyones ear is different so I can't imagine the other prefab fitting would work for many people. That leaves keep buying the foam inserts or get custom fittings made, either way it can be an expensive proposition. Sound is good as it isolates out all external noises. I don't have to raise the volume so much to drown out the other noises (helps to save the hearing). I was a little disappointed they are fairly bigger and stickout more than ""earbud"" style headphones and I can't comfortably use them under my helmet when I ride."
1,Quit Working after about 6 months,"Again, (this is the second pair in a year) the sounds quality was awesome until the left one quit working. Sound comes in and out if I move even the slightest bit. If I hold the part where the one wire splits into two - it quits going in and out - but you shouldn't have to do that. I agree with the other reviewers that say the reason for all the positive responses are people write these when they first get them. There are plenty of other decent earphones that wont break so early."
4,Learned to Appreciate it,"I've had these earphones for about 2 months now. Absolutely hated them and was very, very disappointed when I first got them. Funny thing though is that the more I used them the better I started appreciating how excellent they are. Sound quality - or maybe clarity is a better term - is fantastic. At first I thought the iPod's earphones were better, but when I went back to them, I realized just how much better the Shure's are. Once your ears adjust to the clarity of the Shure's you'll never go back. I'd love to know how much better the E3 or E4 are, but out of my price range for earphones. As others have said, finding the right fit is imperative. Also I recommend leaving the EQ settings on the iPod off, no need to add artificial sound. Yes Bass could always be better, especially for Hip-Hop, but with the proper fit and placement, the sound is pure."
2,Very disappointed with the bass and volume levels,"I spent considerable time reading reviews and searching for an upgraded pair of earpuds for my new 80GB fifth gen iPod. After doing my due diligence, I settled on the Shure E2c-n.I spent several minutes changing the various sizes to get the best fit then plugged them into my iPod to give 'em a whirl. I was very disappointed when I hit play and heard very little bass and an overall lesser volume over my stock Apple buds. I fiddled with other sizes of covers, without success, and swapped the Shure with the Apple stock ones several times with several different genres of music and continued to be disappointed. The one advantage the Shure offered was they did block out external noice to a much greater degree over the stock buds but this was a minimal positive compared to the lower overall volume and reduced sound quality.I'll be returning these tomorrow. :-("
3,Noise Cancelling,"These are good earphones. I have both the Bose 2 Quiet Comfort and these E2c earphones. And I had the opportunity to test both on a 747. The Bose wins hands down when it comes to noise cancellation. But for portability and light use, the Shure E2c is not a bad option. If you would want heavy noise cancellation, get the bose. For light use, the E2c is good. There is a new Bose 3 out. But, I tend to think the Bose 2 is still better in as much as you can replace the battery any time. while the other one requires recharging. Rechargeable batteries do not last forever. So the question of how long you may be using the expensive Bose 3 would be of concern. In summary, just as advertised. The E2c is good noise isolation but Bose 2 is superior for noise cancellation. Especially on a long 747 flight."
2,Not for SHURE,I have had great success with buying on-line in the past. You know how there is always the uncertainty when not inspecting something in person. I was disappointed with the quality and the fit of these earphones. For the price I was expecting something greater.
2,Not worth it! Falls out of your ear...,"This item is a disappointment to me. The plugs need to fit perfectly or else they will fall out of your ear. The manufacturer suggests you wrap the wire around your ear. This is very uncomfortable and if the cord gets caught on something it will pull my ear off. They sound good but not great. I wish I bought these in a retail store so I could return them easier, but I guess I'm stuck with them now. I suggest you pass on these."
2,Where's the Bass?,"I don't get it...I've tried every single ear attachment and there is literally ZERO bass. It's laughable that I paid a bill for these and the stock ear buds sound so much deeper than these. I must be doing something wrong...seriously, NO bass at all. I am not being sarcastic or exaggerating."
2,Great fit / terrible sound,"The fit on this item is great, very comfortable. However, sound is very poor. Music sounds tinny - very disappointed. I am returning them. Not worth $77."
4,shure not a great buy,the case is not in perfect condition a inside piece is missing. Get any answer from the reseller
2,OK Sound with Horrible Bass,"I purchased these after my Bose TriPort ones went out on me (after 3 days) and the sound quality was ok but there was absolutely ZERO bass. I have the sony $40 headphones and those are much better than these or the Bose headphones. I would not tell anyone to get these. I almost bought the E3c's but I could not see myself buying headphones for $180 when the Sony ones work perfect. The have noise reduction and they have earbuds as well as awesome bass/sound quality .. for $40!I fly a lot so I needed something that would take away the sound of a plane and the only reason I was looking for something else was becuase after two years of owning the Sony ones, the cord broke. I will be re-buying the Sony ones. Do yourself a favor and buy Sony or look into E4c's if you're really into sound. If you're on a budget, do not go for these or the Bose as they're both way overpriced for such under-performance."
1,Uncomfortable with Little or No Bass,"I was dissatisfied with the both the sound quality and the comfort of these earphones. As other reviewers, both positive and negative, stated, I followed Shure's instructions for selecting the right sleeve. Many rubber, plastic and foam sleeves of varying sizes are included. The soft rubber one produced the snug seal needed to generate low frequencies, but at the expense of comfort. As others note, you feel like you're under water. Also, none of the sleeves kept the earphones comfortably in my ear.These are not worth the money."
2,"dont bother, low value","I owned the e2c for one year and really didnt have any plans to replace them, but one winter the parts taht bend around the ears broke and the wires eventually went. If that didnt happen I would never have tried the Ultimare Ears fi.3 OMG, I now see what a ripoff the Shures were, the UE has the greatest sound I have ever heard in an earphone, it makes the e2c sound like they are made out of cheese. THey make everything sound great and they are cheaper than e2c. Frankly the e2c never blew me away with the sound, the were however realy good at blocking out external noise which is at least half of what they promise."
5,Great Earphones for the price,"I bought the earphones for my Ipod because the Ipod earphones just didn't fit well in my ears. And they kept falling out. I did think twice about spending $99 on earphones but I have found that they are well worth the money. It does take a little time to get the correct fit. But when you do they are GREAT. I saw a review on Amazon saying that they still didn't know if they are noise canceling. No they are NOT noise canceling. They are noise isolating. Because how they fit in your ear, the only thing you are going to hear is the music coming from your earphones. I was recently on a 2 hour flight from Denver to SF and a baby was crying (screaming) for 2 hours.... and I never heard a thing. Oh, and I bought a pair for my girlfriend so they will not fall during her workouts.My girlfriend doesn't care for the length of the cord. It's longer than most. Doesn't bother me. Forget the Bose earphones... get Shure!"
2,Lousy,Good sound separation but the base is terrible. Don't waste your money. Bought these as an upgrade to the buds that came with the ipod nano. Turns out original pods were better.
1,Very uncomfortable,"Tried them out, switched the buds a few times, very unhappy with the fit and comfort level. Immediate regret followed by return."
4,"These work well, almost too well!","I purchased a pair of these earlier this year and i had a pleasant experience with them. They do a great job at drowning out outside noise from trains, airplanes, etc. They work almost too well, as i have, on more than one occasion, fell asleep listening to music in airports, on buses, even restaurants, without intention, because of the absence of any sound besides the music. However, these are not a good choice of earbuds to use while performing physical activity, as this wears them out more quickly; i discarded my pair after an exposed wire in one ear caused sound to stop coming out of that ear. Other than that, these are the best sound isolating earbuds you can buy for the price."
2,cord gets ridgid,"I bought a pair of these back in march 2006 and now its dec 2006, 9 months later the plastic sheath around the cord is ridgid and cracking around the ears and the bare wire is exposed. I expect earbuds to last more than 9 months when you're paying a premium. Luckily these carry a 2yr warranty. As soon as the new pair comes in, I'll be auctioning those and purchasing a another pair of buds that don't have the wire wrapping around the ear."
1,So dissappointed with Shure......,"This is my second round trying these headphones, previously they were given as a Christmas gift and right out of the box one of the ear buds was broken. At the time I needed something else so I exchanged them. So a little over a month ago I decided it was about time to get some decent ear buds again and thought I'd give Shure another try. My headphones worked well during the first few uses (which was seldom and usually while sitting down somewhere) and it wasn't long before the left ear bud started failing, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I will say that when they work they sound fantastic. All in all I'd avoid Shure's E2c's if I were you."
2,You can do better with you money,"I've owned this product for about 8 months now, and at first this is a great headphone, great sound, good bass, perfect fit, but too bad it wont last too long.1. The rubber WILL crack if you live in cold places, as it did for mine about 2 months ago, and I know this is an issue from seeing other reviews.2. Now one ear isn't working well. it takes a long time to mess around with the connection to make it right, which is extremely annoying.I'm not sure if these issues I've had are the result of prolonged use (average 3-4 hr/day), but yeah, i'm not really satisfied with the over-all performance, because i really thought a $100 earphones will surely last me at least a year and half."
4,Good sound for the price,"Got a newer version of these: Not the E2c as I ordered, but an updated model that is the same except for a few asthetic changes from what I can tell.My impression goes pretty much along with all of the other reviews on here. Can't speak to the longevity of these since I just got them earlier this week. One drawback: I have small ear canals and even the smallest adapter in the included set takes some adjusting to get into my ears right each time."
2,Hurts the Ear,"I bought this as a replacement for my old Sony noise canceling headphones and as an alternative to ear plugs for my long air trips.Neither works, unfortunately - it keeps falling off - i keep inserting them into my ear (very uncomfortable) but regardless, they break loos, letting in all background noise.After 4 hours I used my standard iPhone earphones instead. Bummer."
3,Left bud is louder than the right bud.,"I can really only listen to music for a while before being too annoyed. It is distracting to have the music constantly over loaded to the left ear. If both of them were as loud as the left ear bud the sound would be excellent, but I guess that's the risk you take for buying a refurbished product..."
2,I've tried everything and they don't stay in my ear,"I've spent three months now working with the various earpieces, trying to find ones that fit my ear and stayed there. I've been unsuccessful. Basically, I can only use these earphones when sitting still. Forget about wearing them to the gym -- they fall right out no matter what I do. They also don't seem to point directly into my ear canal (and yes, I have them pointed in the right direction, with the cords going behind my head). I regret this purchase."
2,meh,"The headphone is simply not durable. My original one broke in less than a year; the wiring became exposed when the outer casing ripped off. They gave me another one for free because of the warranty, but that one broke in under a year in exactly the same way. It's a good headphone but it's so fragile."
2,"A big, fat disappointment","The Shure name meant a lot to me and I had counted on good sound quality. Perhaps that is why these ear buds were such a disappointment. The sound seems flat (and I don't mean just the bass). When I tested them alongside some $12 earbuds, they did not stack up. I was looking for some clear separation of music and instruments and I did not find it with these. Perhaps for speech they will be OK, but that is not saying much for some $70 earphones. Likewise, getting them to stay in your ears is a chore, requiring fitting and refitting of the rubber cups. My advice: look elsewhere."
4,Does what it says...,"these earplugs does what it claims, isolates the noise. The sound clarity is very good with my ipod now i use only 1/10th of the volume and its clear and loud enough. It does not just boost the volume, but isolated the noise, the unique design helps it. However the user should take extra care, high volume with this phones can defiantly cause ear damage, esp. certain musics genre.However, i have a complaint, it take a couple week before you can experience the good music without pain. For the first timer, the fitting it tricky and needs experience.Surprisingly this one also delivers good bass for its size. usually it is very difficult to find a a earplug with good bass, but this one is exceptional.Pricewise might be expensive, but for the quality it is worth, look for speacial deals in amazon. you can save more."
2,Could be the right headphones for the right person. I wasn't that person.,"If you are looking for good sound isolating earphones and you have small ear canals then I recommend getting the Shure E4c-n instead of the E2c-n. Even though there were many different tips to use on this model none of them fit my ears correctly.I had the Etymotic brand of earphones before which worked really well with my ears. They were small, fit tightly in my ear canals, and used flange tips. They broke after a year which is why I was in the market for a new pair.Would I have liked the E2c-n's better if they were able to use the flange tips? Very doubtful. They are very bulky and, since I could never quite get a good fit or tight seal, caused my outer ear to ache after wearing them for about an hour.After trying this pair for a couple of weeks I returned them and purchased the Shure E4c-n. I've had them for over a month now and they have worked out great."
4,High performance but pricey...,"High performance in a lightweight package, but a bit on the pricey side. The intonation and definition are very good, but again that's what you're paying for. The noise cancellation could be better, but if you use them in a reasonably quiet environment they seem to block out unwanted sound well enough. The package includes a nice assortment of soft rubber ear adaptors so nearly everyone should be able to find a good fit. They begin to hurt my ears slightly after about an hour of use but a short break does wonders. The storage case is well made but a bit of a pain to use and a little bulky to store. Overall a quality product."
3,Get a Custom Sleeve made!,I also have them and could not keep them in my ears to save my life!I ordered some custom sleeves from Alien Ears and they sound even better then before becasue of the isolation I am getting. Hated them before....love them now!
1,Very. Disappointed.,"These headphones are an absolute waste of money if you like any sort of BASS. The lows comes in REALLY lo, like barely audible, whereas the highs and mids kind of pop, creating a VERY TINNY sound, not warm at all. I'm really disappointed I spent $70 on these. The $15 headphones I bought at bestbuy sound infinitely better. If I could get my money back, I would return these in a heartbeat."
3,"Good Sound Overall, So-So Bass, A Little Awkward Feeling","I researched a bit before deciding on these. They have good sound but I couldn't get much bass after trying all the recommendations I read, and all of the many options of earpiece adapters they provided. Part of the fit and comfort problem was that the earpieces are heavy enough that they kept falling out. I'm not an audiophile, but I think I am pretty picky. I have a good stereo system with old Polk Audio Speakers, use full-sized studio headphones at home (Sennheiser HD-280 Professional Headphones for what it's worth) and encode my audio usually in 256 bitrate. And I do listen to some bass heavy music but also country, folk, classical, and much more. And I did also use the EQ but to no avail. That's my two cents."
4,Sound Isolation is Pretty good,The sound isolation is pretty good. I am using the earphones on my bus rides from and to work and even with normal sound level the surrounding noise is hardly noticeable. What I dislike is that the ear buds are hard to distinguish. Depending on the available light it can be hard to read the little letter for right and left on the ear buds. The previous pair I had from Shure had the right ear bud in two different colors which made it very easy to figure out which one goes in which ear.
5,Ear buds,"They are probably the most comfortable ear buds I have tried yet. The sound is great and I am extremely pleased with the accessories it came with. No matter what size your ear canal, there is an adapter to fit any ear canal. The case is perfect. I have nothing bad to say about these ear buds whatsoever. Thank you."
4,A classic known by another name.,"Also known as Wu Tang & Ninja, this film stars Alexander Lo Rei as a young student of shaolin caught up in a plan set by The Wu Tang high Priest and a group of japanese ninja to take over Shaolin temple. Through Rigorous training he tones his skills to where he thinks he can match the Ninja. and if he is lucky enough to make it alive through that he still must fight the white haird priest. Can you guess where his weak point is?A very good film. Lo rei shows off why he is considered one of the best fist fighters. Great Ninja tricks and fighting styles. An all around good film, and actually a little better quality to."
5,ONE OF THE BEST MARTIAL ART VILLIANS EVER,"Not that many movies,especailly martial art movies,that has a villian that takes two generations to defeat. basically the movie is about the villian,abbot white's,quest to destroy the shaolin temple. While doing so he sides himself with three japanese ninjas who control an army of ninjas. armed with iron skin & the ability to make people explode/implode just by pointing at them. attempts to destroy the temple. You have to see the method of which he maintains his iron skin. I could describe it but it's best for you to see"
3,This is an alright video.,"I own this track and it's alright.There are alot good scenes of Wu-Tang vs Shaolin conflict.But some of it is a bit exaggerated.For instance no one can jump up backwards about 10ft into a tree.Still,all the good fighting makes up for all the stretched clips."
2,I have seen the video and much of it was just plain wild.,I own this video and much of it contains some very good Martial Arts fighting seens. But some of it goes a little to the extreme side when Abbot White starts practicing the iron-shirt. END
3,Fathers are more important to sons than most people think.,"Provocative certainly, educational only if you can spare the time to reflect and talk with others as you read this book. As this century ends, so many otherwise bright people seem convinced you can ignore human reality. All fathers should read this book. Many terms are used to describe a male who grows up unable to hold his own in our society; no father should contribute to his son being one of those men. I wish Gurian had used more case examples of real people. The Author does have an odd reaction to the fact that his clients open up to him, parts of this book I'd edit out. As a Physician, I have an odd reaction if my patients do not open up to me. Enough material here for every man reading it to ensure several days heated debate with every woman you know."
1,Antifeminist ripoff of Reviving Ophelia,"As a minister to youth, I sat down with A Fine Young Man ready to be educated in how to understand the young men I work with and communicate back to them a sense of their own self-worth and integrity in a culture that sells all youth out in innumerable dangerous ways. Instead, I got a litany of the author's personal biases about what he perceives is the ""feminist agenda"" that wants to turn men into women, supported with scanty ""scientific"" evidence (I was a journalist once; I know how to manipulate poll results, too), compounded with a vague injunction to ""do better"" as mentors and parents. I was hoping for more case studies. I was hoping for more concrete suggestions about warning signs and counseling techniques. I was hoping for a non-political firsthand understanding of how our boys struggle to become men in a very confused culture. This book truly disappointed."
2,Catchy for its stereotypical simplicity.,"As a female in this society, I would like to believe that someday we would view respectful, non-aggressive, non-violent males as common instead of exceptional. Many of the author's ideas may encourage emotional closeness in one form or another, but too many of the author's premises are based more upon continued stereotypes than scientific data with many of the studies used to support his point of view being narrow and self-serving in scope. The most workable ideas presented are as fit for female bonding as for male, and parents could find equal alternatives if only they would look past the outward genitalia, relax, and relate to their children as people -- for there are too many exceptions to purported behaviors, etc. to be ignored in favor of yet another testosterone theory."
3,Mastering Tarot,What novice does not need clear and concise information about the tarot deck. It has been by my side as I am learning to read the cards. It is helpful and easy to understand.
2,I only made it through Chapter One,"I got this book from the library and was pretty excited to start reading it. It's possible that most of the book is great, but I won't find out as I struggled to make it through the first chapter before returning it. That chapter is filled with nothing but long lists of ""this guy did that"" and ""another guy did something else"" that was boring, disconnected and pretty repetitive.I guess it's possible the author felt he had to lay down the foundation for the rest of the book, but the first chapter was absolutely brutal to read.If you're interested in the book, I'd suggest you skim (or even skip) the first 40 pages or so."
5,One of the Best Children's Books on Cats!,This is a terrific book about cats. I didn't know they could see color! There are many other interesting facts about cats written in an entertaining form. Seymour Simon is a great non-fiction writer for children and this book is one of the best. Maybe I'm just biased as a cat lover.
5,It is a great war story,This book is a great war story about a real war and it told about all of he deials.
2,Disappointing,"This LP was advertised as being in ""Very Good"" condition, but it skips on every track. I have since found a better copy in an independent record store for less money."
4,The reuniting of college classmates holds surprises for all.,"Patience Magee is a savvy, intelligent woman with an attitude and a temper. From the opening scene this heroine is depicted with a fiery disposition that attracts and repels. You'll either love Patience or hate her. Jace Hoffman was the most boring, ordinary man she knew in college. This was not a person skilled in the art of inspiring thrills. Years later Patience sees him again at a friend's wedding and falls for this Wall Street executive against her independent best interests. She has no need for the interference of domestic or romantic issues. Jace reciprocates her affection, and their relationship leads to steamy seduction and sparkling dialogue as they play off each other's wit. Morgan's fast pace and shock-value scenes will entertain genre fans looking for an unusual read. A polished, skillful delivery."
3,Capstick is a legond,This video is OK. Not a lot of hunting but plenty of Capstick in site. It was just good enough to make me want to check out another one of his movies.
5,Art widow laments,"My husband is an artist. He must have a hundred sketch books. Each has a few sketches in them. He seems to love to collect sketchbooks and pens. They are all over the house and he is always getting a new one. Anyway, I got this one for him as a gift and he really likes it. Says the cover is good quality, and it does look pretty. He also commented that the paper is a good weight and smoothness for both pencil and ink sketching. So, I did well!"
5,A must for any journal junkie,"This was one of the few blank journals that I could find that wasn't pocket sized. I love the paper quality, hidden magnet fastener, and the distressed look for the cover. Definitely a great buy."
3,Not as expected,"The pictures and reviews led me to believe that you could also hang this from a cabinet door instead of screwing it in. When I received it, I realized that wasn't the case. Otherwise it looked like it would do a good job of holding kitchen wraps."
2,Works with the right sized items,"The photo of the product is not exactly what I received in the mail. The photo shows the bars of the rack at the same height on the sides and the front. The rack that I received has the bars on the sides in a much lower position than in front allowing for smaller wrap boxes to tip out of the side of the rack. The Wrap Rack works alright for me, but smaller sized wrap boxes lean or fall out of the side of the rack, sometimes blocking me from being able to open the cabinet door that the rack is attached to."
5,Smart idea for someone with lots of stuff + small kitchen,"I've recently moved into a smaller home, and I had to find a way to fit all my kitchen gadgets within the limited drawer space. So I decided to kick all my plastic wrap/tin foil/lock bags out of my precious drawer space and hang them inside my cabinet doors.Initially I purchased 2, and they were so fabulous that I purchased another 4. Now I have snack bags, freezer bags, wax paper and other similar products all neatly lined up and accessible.Needless to say, I am very happy with this product."
3,WrapRack,I found this rack to be quite small and was only able to fit 2 types of wrap into the rack. Very disappointing.
4,Wrap Rack,"Picture shows available space for 4 boxes of Aluminum Foil and Plastic wrap, but it only hold 3. Good Quality and made well."
3,All about Coke,"Robert Goizueta was on of the most influencial business men of his time. He changed the entire formula of Coke as a product and as a company. The numerous accounts of Goizueta's plans to take coke totally global shown a new light on the world of coke. It was facinating to learn about the behind-the-scenes action that took place to make Coke in to a Brand Name Monster. I would recommend this book to anyone who was interested in finding out how Coke became the most recognizable name in almost all the world and the life story of Robert Goizueta. I don't think, however, it is a good book if you are looking for an enlightening economical outlook."
3,A Good Start,The author does a credible job researching facts and figures surrounding the entry and the eventual reign of Goizueta in the Coca-Cola empire. The book succeeds in being able to provide the reader with an initial glimpse of how Goizueta operated and the transformation of Coke from a an above-average company to one of the greatest corporations in the world. The only setback is the admitted non-cooperation of Goizueta himself in the creation of this book.
2,Disappointing Account of Coke's CEO,Regretably not a very good biography and lacking insight into the business strategies that Goizueta used to build Coke. You are left with a sense that it is more novel than biography. Unfortunate for such a titan of business. Don't buy with hope of finding business insight or what really drove Goizueta. This is an unauthorized biography and the author makes some assumptions and leaps of faith that are not substantiated sufficiently.
1,Smart man - No Heart,"First,let me say I've never read this book.I worked for this company for 3 long yrs.Mr.Goizueta may be a smart business man but he had no idea how to make his employees feel good about their job.Coca-Cola peaked in the 80's but when Coca Cola New England came along they ruined lives.I've never seen a turnover rate like I saw at Coke.Read this book but don't be fooled in thinking Coke is a good career."
4,coca cola mmmmmmmm,the book is really ambitious and portrays Mr.Goizueta as very goal oriented and eager to accmplish what he sets his mind to. The book does a good job of letting the reader know how great of a leader Roberto Goizeta really was.
4,Goizuetas Genius,"I thought that this book was very informative and inpspiring. It seems ironic how the American Dream was achieved through an American product, with an ambitious Cuban man. I found the book to be a little biased. It refuses to show the readers any outside view of Roberto Goizueta. It seems that the author wrote it with the intention of making Mr. Goizueta out to look as perfect as possible. I found the book to be compelling. I very much enjoyed hearing about the gambles Mr. Goizueta took. Such as abandoning TAB SODA in favor of DIET COKE. And when he changed advertising corporations only to change them again years later in order to boost sales. Not to mention his influence in expanding Coca Cola world wide and improving the quality of Coke bottlers globally. I would recomend this book to anyone who is interested in learning anything about how to run a buisness the right way. As exemplified by Mr. Goizueta and the Coca Cola company...From the ground on up."
2,The book did not meet my expectations,"I was looking for the strategies of Coca-Cola in building itself to be the number one consumer brand in the world. Sadly, the gist was not there. Some of the materials were repeated and sequel of events were not well-presented."
4,Cute!,"This cute little recipe book is just what you want from a Schulz product. Granted, I find that 25$ was a little steep to be paying for a 30 page book, but I can't really complain as I bought it anyways. I haven't tried any of the recipes, yet, and, honestly, I don't know that I will try them all. Some of them are a little terrifying, but others sound smashing."
5,Blast from the Past,"My wife saw a reference to this little book in a very old magazine or something, and really thought it looked interesting for the grandkids when they stay over. Never really thought I would find it, but there it was on Amazon.com. Reading the words of Charles Schultz, and viewing the illustrations, not to mention using the simple recipes, is not only fun for the grandkids, but it's like mini time travel for my wife and I. Really, really great, and the book was in excellent shape for being so old. Kudus to Amazon.com and to the seller. Having a place where these older items can be found, sold, or purchased, shows what a truly wonderful site Amazon.com has developed."
3,"Hokey Pokey, Chicken Dance",I bought this for my 3-year-old who loves to do the hokey pokey and the chicken dance. I was really disappointed with the hokey pokey. It is VERY fast and hard to keep up with. I was looking for a CD with the songs you dance to at weddings. The other songs aren't catching for a 3-year-old. I did like the name game. It has a fun beat and my kids love dancing around the house to it.
2,Disappointing,We rented this because of Damian Lewis. It was mindless fluff that had us wondering why we spent the money.
2,"Great casting, but story line fizzles...","Assassin in Love is full of actors that are perfectly matched for their parts, from the local vet to the fishmonger to the eccentric guys battling over the ""best garden"" prize.But the story? Burned out assassin wants to start anew, moves to small town, becomes a baker (with no lessons), the town finds out his past, yada yada.The ending is supremely underwhelming. And where, oh where, did a couple of fencing sabers suddenly pop up from?This needed something else, starting with amnesia after getting knocked by a flying head from a ewe that exploded."
4,UV Light for air cleaner,"I have had this product for several weeks and it seems to clean the air in my living room. It runs pretty quiet on all speeds. The only problem i have with this air cleaner is that i can't see the UV light, so i don't know if it's burned out or not. I have another air cleaner productthat has the UV light and i can see it thru the filter, so i know when it burns out.Thank you"
1,Stay away,"Piece of junk. Simply wastes electricity and is noisy on ""high"". Cabinet made of cheap plastic that ""attracts"" dirt to the outside, so it needs frequent cleaning. 2 Filters will cost as much as a new unit. For about $50 more, check out the green air machines on ebay. (No, I am not associated with them). Tossed this Multi-tech for a REAL air cleaner; the difference is phenominal. One green air freshens the whole house and keeps Grand-dads smoke to a minimum. AND, the filters are ALL washable."
3,"Farewell, Leslie","Although this sounds like dated Asian-pop, this is a great album to listen and get a feel for Leslie's talents. Farewell, Leslie. You left us April 1, 2003."
4,Durable and Pretty !,I had Corelle dishes years ago and I went back to them because they wear so well. They aren't so heavy and don't chip in the dishwasher. They also heat food well in the microwave (which is the main reason I bought them!). Great for everyday use! This particular pattern is not a vivid red color. More of a rose red color.....but pretty.
3,It's PINK!,"I read the one review saying that these dishes were pink, but (silly me!) thought that they would really be a ""cream of tomato"" color. Wrong! They're pretty much a bubblegum pink color! Not as rich looking..."
5,Love these!,These are the prettiest Corelle dishes I've ever had. The salad plates coordinate so nicely with the pattern on the larger plates/mugs. These are my favorite!!!!
2,poor color transfer on cups,"I expected the dishes to be more substantial. The plates are very light and thin, more like melamine in feel. The colors on the dinner plates and bowls are like in the pictures seen on the internet so they are what I expected. Very disappointed with the cups- I bought two sets, and only 1 of the 8 cups had ALMOST the same color intensity as the dinner plates-the others were so faded (kinda like when your color cartridge in your computer is outta ink) they looked like, either rejects,or they had gone through a heavy load dishwash 100 times"
3,Nice pattern but plates don't feel as smooth as the old correlle patterns,"I like the pattern a lot. This is a nice set, and it is very nice that each dish has a different but coordinating pattern. However the dishes feel rough when you put your hand over them, and I am worried that they won't hold up as well as my old correlle set."
3,Corelle going downhill?,"These dishes, while pretty, are warped, inconsistent in colour from one piece to the next, the cups are so small there's nothing I could think to use them for.I will forever regret giving away my nearly complete set of the Corelle Summer Blush pattern. That was by far the best set of dishes I owned. Now they cost a fortune on ebay because they're discontinued.My advice? Buy a different pattern."
5,Beautiful Set of Corelle Dishes,"I have just received my Corelle Heirloom Bloom set of dishes. After reading some of the reviews, I was apprehensive to open the boxes, for fear maybe some of the cups would be broken. I was extremely happy to see that after inspecting each and every piece of the two boxes, service for 8, that they were in PERFECT CONDITION. What a beautiful set of dishes. I am very, very pleased with my selection. I know we will get many years of enjoyment using this dinnerware set. Thank you for such a beautiful set of dishes."
1,Broken dinnerware,"Item came in broken pieces due to poor being poorly packed. Had to return item,they did not have another for replacement."
2,Beautiful Heirloom Bloom Dinnerware,"I am very pleased with the dishes. Years ago I owned Corelle dishes, and am now wondering why I went the way of the heavier dishes. They don't scratch or take up a lot of space. I bought two sets. I love love the colors and my table settings are so nice to look at, especially since I purchased table mats with big orange blooms to put the dishes on and celery napkins to match. It really makes for a beautiful table. I get compliments all the time. I was also very pleased with how quickly I received the dishes - in about 3 days. I am always happy with my purchases made through Amzon.com."
4,"Excellent, for you Amber Brown fans!","This book is about Amber Brown, who has just entered the fourth grade, her parents are divorced, her dad lives in Paris she and her mom live in America, her mom is dating and she difintly DOESN'T want him to marry her. But for her Mom and DAd to get back together."
3,Dog Chews,"The actual dog chews are great for my dog. Just will never order or have them shipped during the summer to Las Vegas' 100+ degree weather. They arrived melted and caked together. Complained to the company and they were honorable enough to refund my partial shipment. Didn't want to waste that partial shipment, so tried to cut and save them, but not very successful. Would order this product again through Amazon, but only during colder weather."
3,Good starting point,It is a nice collection of essays that would constitute a good starting point for the problems associated with the variosu social security systems and alternatives to these. It is not a must-have since very similar work can be found at OECD and alike web sites.
1,Did not work! Not even a little bit.,I bought this because there were no bad reviews.Now there is one.Don't buy it.It would not grip screws at all. It slipped just like a regular screwdriver.I would give it 0 stars.
3,"works, kinda","You need a LOT of pressure to make this tool work, but it does. Wish the handle was about 8"" longer."
3,"""Malossol""?","Guys, do you know what ""malossol"" means in Russian?""Lightly salted"".This particular caviar was actually over-salted quite a bit.Other than that its a very good tasting caviar (I guess you can blame a puddlefish for that), very close to Russian Sturgeon's caviar."
5,Does this single have an album?,"Cuz this is easily one of the coolest genre-bending tracks I've come across (second to sasha of course!) I'm really interested in this Emma girl. It's like a fusion if jazz, trance and eighties soul"
4,Disturbingly beautiful..,"Genji's mother died when he was young, and he's been looking for her in all of his relationships with women ever since. And there are a *lot* of relationships: I had trouble at first figuring out who was sleeping with whom, and who was related to whom. The Tale of Genji is full of moving imagery and symbolism, but be prepared for a lot of beautiful, quiet, prolonged sequences where nothing much happens. There's even a Kubrick-esque dream sequence at the end; as confusing and anti-resolution as the end of 2001. :) The music is wonderful as well, and I've never said that about any other anime I've seen."
3,Great Animation - Slow Story,"This animation movie was made in Japan and is subtitled. The story is void of any action and has a slow story line. It is an excerpt out of the famous ancient Japanese book by the same title by Murasaki Shikibu. The Tale of Genji tells of the non-fictional character Genji who is court prince in the times of Japan (c.1000 AD). Only recommended for animation or Japanese Historical enthusiasts. However, the animation is near perfect for realism and for those students of history it has a lot to offer about ancient Japanese Culture. END"
4,Maddalena,"Have you been looking for a great read? If you like books with a great historical background, this is a book you will enjoy to read. It is entertaining and educating at the same time and I can highly recommend it."
5,The Text as Canvas,"Siroka takes the rich fabric of 16th century Italy and paints a vibrant canvas of love, lust, betrayal, piety, and morality. The characters resonate with a life made possible only by her wealth of knowledge of the time period.Enough of a guilty pleasure to warrant a second read."
3,"Rare Single - But Not ""Enta Da Stage"" Quality","I'm a huge fan of Black Moon, but mostly thanks to tracks like ""I Got Cha Opin"", and this single is nearly as grimey. Buck Em Down contains a sample of ""Wind Parade"" as performed by Donald Byrd. DJ Evil Dee produced both of the tracks on this album, and Chi Modu shot the cover photo.Tracklisting:1. Buck Em Down - Da Beatminerz Remix [4:55]2. Buck Em Down - Instrumental [4:55]3. Murder MCs - B Side Vocals [5:17]4. Murder MCs - Instrumental [5:06]This is a decent single. A rare CD to come by, but not among my favorite Black Moon tracks."
4,"Comfort with height, finally!","Awesome shoe!! Very comfortable on my feet. Even though it's high healed sneacker you really don't fee too much of height and none of it's negetive side affects. I can actually run in this. Only thing is that it looks little too casual and your feet can get really HOT wearing it. I would recommend wearing thin sox. I originaly brought Dark Brown in size 7 (normally wear 6 or 6 1/2 size shoe) but had to return it to get 6. way too big. It's wider than I'm used to even though I have wide feet; offers plenty of toe room. If they offer 6 1/2 size , it would have been perfect wearing my thick sox in winter. Unfortunetely there are no half sizes offered. I wanted to buy Black in 6 also, but 7 is too big and smaller sizes tend to go fast and there are no more option for me now."
4,Fun,"We bought this game for my sister in law for Christmas. We really enjoyed playing and using the props to act out our words. Be careful with the props because you need them to play the game, and they're a little flimsy. Also be careful acting out 'tennis' by hitting the ball with the noodle - you may hit your mother in law in the face with the ball inadvertantly!!"
3,Helpful but seriously outdated,"While this book does contain a good amount of information, it is seriously out of date (as is the Harry Benjamin Gender Dysphoria Association, which is based on his research and beliefs). For instance, the real life ""test"". For some this can be the worst thing. What this book does show is how many hoops we as transsexuals have to jump through in order to finally be happy. For our surgery (it is basically nothing more than cosmetic surgery) we have to ""pass"" tests and fit into stereotypes. If we have to, then why do people wanting other cosmetic surgery like breast enlargement not have to go get 2 letters? Seriously out of date, and high time it be taken out of print and someone write a new book. Times have changed, and this book would have us stuck in a time warp. I only recommend this book as something as a basis, to help understand, but not as gospel."
4,"I thought it didn't work at first, but ended up doing the trick","Didn't think this was going to work out, and it went in the drawer after an unsuccessful attempt.. You really have to put some elbow grease in but it does work.."
1,Does Not Work,"$18, down the drain. Tried this NUMEROUS times, and even had a handy(er) neighbor give it a whirl as well, and it did nothing but cause frustration. Doesn't grip one-way screws at all, regardless of the pressure applied. After purchasing, I read numerous handyman sites that say don't bother to buy these as they are expensive and rarely work (better off getting a Dremel and just cutting off the head of the screw, which is what I will end up doing)."
3,Pamal.,This isn't a terribly great book. It doesn't explain things easily for students like it should. It's a good book...but not for beginner French students.
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is terrible, there is no real action, and the ""plot"" is ridiculous.The loose plot revolves around this detective getting kidnapped by this drug cult. They dress up in black trash bags and wear masks, and there seem to be more of them than actual citizens in the movie. They kidnap the cop. The girlfriend convinces the police chief to go after him. He tracks the cop with a gps device. No joke. The Chief and gf track him to a building...where they get trapped in a room and sit for hours. No, really.Side plot, another cop shoots a beggar by accident.I won't ruin the ending, in case you do watch it. But coming from someone who likes to watch bad movies, this wasn't even ""good"" bad, or ""funny"" bad. It's all bad, and afterwards you will wonder what you are doing with your life."
1,"Totally Worthless, disconnected, inane, pointless ---","Even if the budget was only $10 USD WHY waste $10 to make a movie like THIS??? Were they hoping it is so poor that it would become a cult classic? True that NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was made on a tiny budget, BUT the size of the budget does not a cult classic make. There is no story here. It is a garbled compilation of shots that in someone's mind means something. For our sakes, I hope that someone is locked snugly away in an institution. I gave it a chance, and it crapped all over itself."
2,watch out for the hiss,"Despite reading reviews that warned of an audible hiss in all but optical modes, I ordered this anyway as I use an optical connection. The electronic whine, which Soundmatters' FAQ describes as rarely an issue, is so loud (in all modes) that you can easily hear it across the room whenever the soundtrack goes quiet. Very annoying. I seriously doubt if all the units are this bad. I'll be returning this one tomorrow. It's too bad as the sound is otherwise quite good."
2,"Great idea, bad execution","I wanted to get better sound on my TV without buying a complete TV speaker system so this unit seemed ideal. However, I needed to return it twice for malfunctions. There was a processor problem which created static sound during a broadcast. (Customer service was very good.) The unit is OK for spoken word TV broadcasts but DVDs with music are a real problem. The soundtrack is played back too loud relative to the dialogue which is very distracting. I was very excited about this product and overall it has not met my expectations. I don't use it much."
2,"College Students, Keep Looking","I purchased this book with the greatest of intentions. Unfortunately, it is so rambling and disorganized that I was not successful.In reading the other reviews, it is apparent that the focus of this book was on the college level student reader. True, to my knowledge there is nothing out there with the same focus. However, Land of Contrasts, while written at the supposed high school level (though I enjoyed it), is much more organized and a better read.I did enjoy the Bleeding Kansas section, Civil War impact, and the building boom time period of the 1880's. Then the organization starts falling apart.I tried hard to like this book, but I couldn't get past the way it jumped around in topical themes to decide whether I really was enjoying it or whether I was missing something somewhere. I decided to put it back on my book shelf and to get over the headache it had created, and then try again another day.College students, keep looking out there."
2,More like a weak summary than a history,"This book reads more like a few index cards collected at the KU library than it does a real state history. Instead of any detail of the OK Corral shootout in Dodge City (or any other history of Kansas west of Salina) we get three mentions of the KU basketball team. In another example, the author mentions the ""Wakarusa War"" in passing at least four times before briefly explaining it later in the book, with the author presumably assuming all of us are familiar with the river that runs near Lawrence. The author explains in the preface that a ""literal collection of history would be a paperweight"" and instead gives us a meandering narrative with few actual examples, ironically making this a paperweight for everyone else. The state of Kansas deserves a better documented history than a transcript of two KU basketball fans discussing the history of the northeast corner of the state."
3,Sentence Structure,"I can speak Hindi, but can not write Hindi. This is a fairly easy to follow book if you are a beginner. It gives a good overview."
3,What's up with the extra $30 for radio?,"SMC is asking for $30 to access all the radio stations. I do not think this is a fair price for something which is essentially a list of web addresses.If you look around you can find UPNP servers which can run on one of your PC's and take a .m3u or .pls file from the radio station and serve it to this device. Unfortunately, this partially defeats the purpose of this device of beeing able to turn off your computer.I am using cidero right now on OSX. It is written in JAVA and should run in many other places too. The only problem is that it is very slow and that if you press the keys too fast the device hangs.I also found the eyeconnect UPNP server from elGato. It serves my iTunes just fine except that it puts up just one big list. Fortunately it also serves the playlists.The three stars are for the annoying implementation of the radio feature."
4,"Sil-a-Gel, but not a bad product","After ordering this product I discovered it was made of Sil-a-Gel PVC, which conveniently never shows up in the product descriptions (which is almost completely lacking for this product) of these things unless it's a high end material. Having had other bad experiences with this material, namely Doc Johnsons Sil-a-Gel crystal Jellie line, I was a little wary that this product too would smell extra bad and burn sensitive skin. However, my fears were not founded as this is a quality economical product; no-frills, cheap, and does what it's supposed to. While things will definitely stick to this (like skin, hair, lint, etc.) and I wouldn't describe the smell as good, it has a slight PVC rubber scent, is really easy to clean, and didn't irritate my skin. Also the heads are pretty big, so I wouldn't suggest it as your first toy. If it was less stretchy and more rigid I would have given it five stars."
3,Strong horror anthology,"Amicus films pulled Hammer standards Cushing and Lee into doing this overall entertaining horror anthology. The story begins on a train where fortune teller Cushing uses his tarot cards to predict the unenviable futures of five men. The first two stories are probably the weakest, but hold tight because they get better. The third tale is a about voodoo and it is considerably better than the first two. The real gems are the last two entries of the five. The fourth story has Christopher Lee as a snooty art critic who gets pursued by a relentless severed hand and the fifth is an interesting vampire story starring a young Donald Sutherland. This film is definitely reccommended, just remember it gets better as it goes along."
4,"Found Again, movie from my youth","I remember being a child that did not like horror movies. My friend tried to make me watch Freddy and Jason when I was little and I had to hide in the bathroom and had nightmares for weeks. Well, I remember flipping channels and seeing a movie that was divided up into stories. It was a little too scary for me then, but I remembered it. Then a few more times over the years I came across this movie again and watched it. I now relate it to another Peter Cushing movie, The original Tales From the Crypt. They take a group of people and tell stories about all of them separately and shows how it affects the group pretty much. It is very campy, but if you enjoy older horror movies and want some fun on a Saturday this is a good movie for it. Definitely worth a chance. Keep the faith, dExtrosien"
3,It Grows On You,"When I first saw this film in the early 1970s, I started out thinking that it wasn't very good. However, the creepiness grows on you, and by the time I left the location where I had been watching it, 'along about midnight' (!), I was thoroughly scared and not really up to a long walk home in the dark !The acting is either above average for the genre or deliciously over the top.Special mention must be made of the superbly atmospheric musical score by British twelve-tone composer Elisabeth Lutyens."
1,BE CAREFUL!!!!,I bought a copy of this (to me) five star film . The one that started it ALL . It won't play on any of my Region 1 players . I bought my copy (The Best Of British Collection) off the folks at AmazonU.K. They disowned me when i tried to get my money back!!! Be careful....
1,Dr.Terror's House of Horrors.,"I saw this recently on NF, And I must say the audio is horrible and with the exception Of having Sutherland and Of Course The Man Himself Christopher Lee the movie is plain Boring,Lee has made better films than this, I usually am a Fan of Anthology Horror Movies and Classics,But it just didn't do it for me."
2,Very bland (even for Japanese cuisine),"After living in Japan for 7 years one gets cravings for certain items. One day it was for soba. With no local sellers I tried this. Bad move. This is very generic, run of the mill, brand X. Nothing special about this at all. Japanese cuisine is supposed to be subtle and not overpowering, but even by those standards this was bland. Better luck next time.If you were going to eat the soba with tempura or onions or something else that imparts some flavor it might be good enough to get by in a pinch, but for plain-vanila ""zaru-soba"" it's not quite good enough."
1,Unpleasant,"Another vanity press book, pushed through without any editing whatsoever. A person can state that someone needs a better editor, but someone who intends to write for a living must have a better grasp of the English language themselves. There is a rather identifiable difference between minor errors and someone who clearly lacks a fundamental understanding of grammar, sentence structure, spelling, and sentence fluency. This is not intended to come across as an ad hominem attack, but as a statement of fact.An honest attempt to tell an interesting story is present, but it's lost beneath the unnecessary vulgarities, off-color humor, and again, the unacceptable writing quality of the story."
1,"square is square, but rule inaccurate","The unit I purchased was square enough, but its rule was WAY off.The 0 point on the rule at the inside corner was off by 1/20"" ! The inch-to-inch stampings were much too inaccurate as well, to my taste.This item costs little and I didn't buy it to measure length, but a rule this bad should not get out the door. (I found the 0 error about the same on another unit I examined months later.) Doesn't someone eyeball these things, even for a second ?Johnson's customer service did take care of me promptly when I told them of the problem, but I wouldn't touch another model 450."
2,sweet honey from the rock,I expected this cd would be more Christian songs. It wasnt my style. But mostimportant I was sent two of the same thing. Then Amazon was suppose to send me a return slip and never did. Now I think it's too late.
3,I'm at a Catch 22,"I have mixed emotions about this release by one of my favorite female singers. For the most part it's not what you say but how you say it, but in this case, it's backwards. What I mean is I LOVE her voice!!!! Even earlier in her career, the smooth, softness of her singing (mainly from her first 2 releases) makes you wish that you had a woman at home that could sing to you the way that she does. Which leads me to this CD; I STILL LOVE her voice, but some of the songs don't do justice to her capabilities. How she sings is still a wonderful eargasm, but WHAT she sings just ain't what I'm used to hearing from her. Overall, the CD isn't bad.........but if you really want to hear Chante' at her best, grab ""Precious"" and/or ""A Love Supreme""."
5,Great music :-),"I own all of Chantes cds. I got this quite a while back but I still love to listen to it because it's beautiful. The music is great and her voice is soft and soulful. She's a very underrated singer, but full of talent. I love Take Care Of Me, Better Than Making Love and Everything We Want. This is her fourth cd, and maybe it's not the best out of all she's done, but it's great nevertheless and well worth listening to. I find it really relaxing and great to chill to. If you are a fan of Chante's and don't already own this, then what are you waiting for - you'll love it."
3,NOT HER BEST BUT SOLID.,"I fell in love with Chante Moore after really listening to her second album which I think is a masterpiece. This album is solid even though there are one or two songs I would skip over. There are more good songs on this album than the bad one which makes this album decent. Chante's secret weapon? Her voice. Overall, EXPOSED is a good album but not her best."
3,music,after listening to the cd i amdit it has some good tracks on it but she is more of a woman with a voice to slow jams and flow not fast beat songs. i feel she should change music producers to find the right music that fits her god gifted voice.
2,C'mon Chante,"As a fan since the Precious Album I have become increasingly disappointed in Chante's releases. I am sick and tired of hearing her fabulous voice on ""okay"" tracks. She is the best background arranger out there and if it weren't for that the songs on this album would just flop into oblivion. The only songs that save this album and reflect the Chante Moore that diehard fans fell in love with are M-A-N, Bitter and Better than Making Love. We miss the real Chante Moore!"
3,Not the Best,"I am a huge Chante Moore fan and could not wait for this album to be released. I heard ""Bitter"" on the radio and immediately fell in love with it. I was very surprise and disappointed to hear the album version of the same song. I couldn't believe such a classy and talented artist would sing such lyrics. I will continue to listen to the old Chante Moore and hopefully her next album will be better."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"Don't get me wrong, I love, love, love Chante Moore. I own all of her CD's and I love them. But this CD is not what I expected. I only like two songs on the whole recording and those are titled Everything We Want and Love's Still Alright. Chante is an excellent singer and performer. This won't stop me from purchasing any future projects."
3,Will The Old Chante Moore Please Stand Up?,"Don't get me wrong----I am a HUGE fan of Chante's but this CD was very disappointing! I am convinced as never before that Chante is a ballad singer----STRAIGHT UP! I know singers mature and evolve, but I couldn't feel the energy in this CD as I had from Precious, Love Supreme or This Moment Is Mine. Her voice is angelic and she won my heart over with her much earlier work. I especially love it when she does duets with strong male counter parts (i.e, Will Downing, George Duke, BeBe Winans). Chante, hip-hop is not your thing! Go back to your roots baby!"
2,Don't Buy It....,"...I'm telling you I've purchased ""Precious"", ""A Love Supreme"" and ""This Moment is Mine"". Precious, was by far the best CD Chante will ever do in this lifetime. Lots of artists only dream of such a wonderful debut with the likes of George Duke, BeBe Winans, Stanley Clarke, & Will Downing behind the scenes. ""A Love Supreme""...well, all I can say is ""what a waste"". ""This Moment is Mine""...I thought well maybe she's heading back in the right direction. Then I bought ""Exposed""...what a joke! Not one song showcases her truly incredible voice. All of the songs are electronic ""hip hop"" produced by the likes of Dupre, Jam/Lewis, and Laney Stewart (whoever that is). Her vocals are light, airy and devoid of any real substance. All I can wonder is doesn't a person that can really sing know when they are HEARING BAD MUSIC? I can't imagine Chante would signoff on such a project. Totally disappointed. If anyone wants a copy you can have mine!"
1,A Big Fat Zero,"This is the album that turned real music lovers away from Chante. Two web sites that were devoted to Chante were taken down because the owners were so disappointed in the direction that she took. Why, because she sold out BIG TIME with this record. When this was first released, I listened to the cd twice and then put it away. I hated it. Recently, I pulled the cd out and listened to it again and my opinion has not changed. This cd is really bad and she sounds desperate. Desperate for a hit, she employed Jermaine Dupri and Da Brat of ALL PEOPLE to help her and made herself look bad. Had Chante stayed true to herself, her style would have made an impact. I really believe that. But she took the low road and paid for it. I really hope she get it right the next time."
2,Waste of a true talent,"This CD is a waste of Chante Moore's beautiful voice. Instead of her usual beautiful and elegant ballads, we have Chante gettin' ""ghetto"".....and she's no Mary J. Blige. Thank God. The songs just don't work with her angelic voice. Go back and listen to ""A love Supreme"" or ""This Moment is Mine"" this CD is a dissappointment for any Chante fan!"
4,Chante leaves you wanting Moore...,"Chante Moore, does it again in this CD. This Cd has more up beat cuts adn rap duets. It is different from her other CD's. But in the End it is still Chante giving us her best with her smooth sulty voice. Like all of her CD before it, this is s detaling of what was going on in her life at the moment with Kadeem Hardison. It is a personal glimpse into her feelings at the time. It is expressive and emotional & should be in your collection for ""those"" days that you feel like letting it out a little bit, venting or bragging...It is a nice CD. Chante has another solid Cd at hand."
1,You have got to be kidding,"I downloaded this cd and after I heard Bitter I deleted the file. Girl, you have got to be kidding to use the ""N"" word in this song. I will never spend my money on Chante Moore again."
1,"From ""Chante's Got a Man at Home"" to ""Bitter"" (""Nigga"")","What on earth possessed Chante' to record the song, ""Bitter"" and to refer to Black men as ""niggas?""She is setting a poor example for young women and is no longer a role model. Not all Black people use this word and it's just so shocking to hear her sing it. It really takes away from her physical and lyrical beauty.The rest of the songs are overly commercial and just plan silly.It's obvious that she's a 33 year old woman, who looks 23 but acts like she's 16 with juvenile lyrics and her stupid gym video! She should stop trying to compete with Christina Aguilara and Britney Spears.She's a mother and supposedly a ""lady"" whose supposed to have class, dignity and self respect yet she has let producers/artists like Jermaine Dupri and DaBrat record with her and this ""cheapens"" her image.This album belongs in the trash can and will not stand the test of time. Teenagers are fickle and will not be singing songs from this cd even 3 months from now!"
2,What Happened Baby Girl?:-(,"This album doesn't seem to fit the Chante I remember hearing when she sang ""Love Me Tonight"" with El DeBarge and classics ""As if We Never Met"" and ""Your Love's Supreme"". I sure wish Chante would re-discover that old-school-luvin' sound that made her one of the smoothest-sounding sistas in this ever-so predictable world of R&B. I understand that with time comes changes but Chante you sound as if you sacrificed your monumental voice for spark-in-the-pan ""commercial sound""."
1,Yuck !!!,"Please note, I gave one star out of sympathy if nothing else. What's going on ?? What's happened?? I have just cringed my way through a pathetic line up of tacky, pubescent lyrics that sound like they belong to a teeny bopper group and not a mature woman. What's happened, Chante? It was painful to hear her beautiful voice being wasted on lines such as ""here's the number to my cell......"". I'd like to think that she has grown out of that adolescent behaviour. Oh and by the way, did you really use the N word on your third track? - Shame on you, Chante, comments like that will obliterate 400 years of struggle and send us right back to the plantations. Chante, do whatever it takes to get back on track. If you do another album like that.........you'll be finished."
5,There Are No Words!!!!!!!,"To me, anyone who doesn't like this album is a straight up hater. Chante did not change a thing about herself. She simply EXPOSED feelings in a way fans weren't used to but I love it without a doubt. This album is edgy, sexy, somewhat avant garde, and absolutely beautiful. Throughout, you feel like you are experiencing something original that you can experience no where else. Every single track is 5 stars and TIGHT!!!! And the way it ends, with ""Love's Still Alright"" simply beautiful."
2,Disappointing,"I am a big Chante Moore fan, loved all her CD's prior to this, especially Love Supreme. She seemed to be trying to hard to keep up with the mainstream music. I like the old style alot better. She sounds like any other singer out there on this one. You can definitely tell Jermaine Dupre had something to do with this one. what's the saying again, don't fix it if it's not broken...that definitely applied here."
5,Great stuff,"I'm a new comer to Chante Moore. I don't know about her old stuff but i heard that they were good. I like this album, but all the people that liked Chante's older albums seem to dislike this one. Maybe i won't like her old ones. I liked Straight Up the best. It was the reason i bought the album."
1,Does anyone remember CalvinBall?,"If a dyslexic writer wrote a treatise on the U.S. tax code, it would read like this book.My advice is that if you're an experienced programmer and the boss ever comes to you and asks if you'd take over the Installshield duties from the last person who (inexplicably) is no longer going to handle them, don't spend your money on this book -- put it directly into a new resume or job-hunting service.PS -- CalvinBall was the favorite game of Calvin, from comic strip Calvin & Hobbes, in which Calvin simply did whatever he wanted, and pronounced that as the rules as he went."
2,Sitting on my shelf!,"I stopped reading it half way thru. It was taking way to long to get the information I want it. Did not help me dealing with different Operating Systems (95,98,NT,2K). Very important to know how to handle the particular OS and IE, and I did not see any info about it. How to handle ADO, DAO MDAC's etc..I have used Express, Standard and now the Pro Windows Installer and InstallShield is very buggy anyway, so be carefull. Check the News Group, it's loaded with emails for help. That's were many answers that helped me came from.Wait till the book's price is half off!"
1,This book stinks...,"The book is poorly presented and organized. The author keeps refering to other chapters or references to make his point. Out of the 20 chapters, there are less than 10 examples. Most of the them are unclear, lengthy, and unreproducible. The CD-ROM is useless, except for those demo programs. The writing is highly abstract. The author seems to assume the readers can read his mind. It is not worth ... Users may be better off to get help from the HOWTO topics...."
1,Stinks!,"The whole idea of InstallShield Developer is to make it easier to write installations using the Windows Installer. Throughout the book the author keeps referring to the installer database, as if you wanted to directly modify the installer database instead of using a user friendly IDE (which is the whole point with using a program like InstallShield Developer). You'll be better of reading the InstallShield help files. Not recommended."
3,Great information but...,"Baker has written a book that provides everthing you want to know about Installshield and the Windows Installer service. It's a shame his editor let him down: Duplicate words, missing words, and misplaced words muddy what otherwise would have been clear and comprehensive information."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS !,I unfortunately have this cursed book because of my ignorance. After reading it I became even more confused and used Install shield just as bad or even worse than before due to my greater confusion. I feel cheated and injured. Now I can't even sell it to get my money back. It's best to burn it and go on with my life. Most things in this book are Install Shield related but in a very round about way and just plainly splattered all over the place without any coherence to whatever you might be trying to do. It's like reading a book upside down with the pages in the wrong place. :) <--- before :( <--- after
4,A good book about a complex topic,"If you want to understand Windows Installer in detail this book is a very good choice. Be aware that it's not easy reading because the Microsofts Installer is nothing you understand on the fly. It's also not bad to have some basic programming knowledge to understand the code samples (written in C++ and VBScript) and to have an idea about Windows 2000 and Active Directory. One thing the book doesn't cover is the repackager from Installshield (Spy). Specially for admins, this is a very important tool and because it seems to me that the Spy is quiet buggy I would have been glad if I had got some help in handling it."
1,It doesn't do anything.,I think it's too fine and doesn't do anything. This was a waste of money for me. The fine cone it just too smooth.
4,Masterpiece,Charlie's debut album is right on target for rock & roll lovers. Beautiful crafted music with plenty hooks and guitar riffs!!!
2,Unremarkable First Try,"Poorly produced, potentially good work by very talented musicians.Invest in No Second Chance...their very best album by far."
3,"Great toy, but quite pricey","This is a very fun game. Two pirate ships try to ""sink"" each other by sending cannons over to the other one. Beware - it is a VERY large game and takes up a goodly amount of floor space.I really do like this game, but it has two big drawbacks. The first is obvious, it takes a lot of space! It takes space in the cupboard and space on the floor. Not an easy game to just whip out. The second is its high cost. Not unreasonable for what you get, but very pricey for a game that is finished in a matter of minutes.If you love pirate ships, have space and cash to burn, this is the game for you!"
3,Do your homework,"Warning! Make sure this card will work in your camera before buying. This card, because of its high capacity, uses FAT32 file system to store photos. Many older cameras use FAT16 and can't format this card. You can find a partial list of compatible cameras on SanDisk's website. If you are unsure about your camera, play it safe and buy 2GB or lower cards which all use FAT16."
5,"good value, good performance.","I had 1gb, 2gb cards already and since I got a 10mp camera so 4gb card is a must. All the Sandisk CF cards had perform flawlessly the last few years. Recommended!"
2,Kind of cheap looking,"I ordered this online, but when it arrived I was disappointed. The case is not high-quality. For the price, it is a rip-off. The fabric is inexpensive, and the logo on the front is ugly. I covered it up with a hippie patch to make it look better. I guess I am stuck with it, but I hope you will look elsewhere as this item is definitely not worth the price."
5,"magnifico, gran calidad","saludoseste producto es uno de los mejores comprados, gran calidad, atención del vendedor, cumplimientode etapas del procedimiento y entrega a tiempogracias"
4,Well made,"The level is well made and true to level. A good product for a good price. There are plastic levels out there for a cheaper price, but you get what you pay for. In this case it is good price and good product."
5,A different kind of road trip.,"Harry seems to have a charmed life, with a successful business, a bunch of guys who tease each other over coffee, a lady who might be interested in him. He also has a difficult relationship with his adult son and something very dark in his past. A phone call from a dying Navy buddy brings that back to the surface. Harry tries to track down the man who suffered a brutal attack at the hands of his so-called friends. A series of flashbacks tell more and more. We suspect what happened before it is finally revealed. Along the way, Harry calls on other members of the gang and sees that their lives have been affected by what they took part in. The ending is a hard punch to the gut. I'm glad this film is now available on DVD since it never made it in wide release in the theaters."
5,This is an amazing history,"This is an amazing history of Maxwell Street told through the stories of astonishing characters who came from there. One could not invent many of the very real characters, from Yellow Kid Weil to Benny Goodman and Barney Balaban, who started out in impoverished Jewish immigrant families and became part of the fabric of America. It reads almost like a novel."
2,Make sure you get what you ordered,"I had ordered this lens hood directly from Adorama (for less, BTW) but received a different hood. So, if you need this specific hood shown here (fit for zooms), then Adorama will not have it and send you a different (quite cheap-quality) one."
5,"Get ready to laugh, cry and live in Katie's world!","A Season of Dreams is a sweet, satisfying story about true friendship and young love. The four main characters are so real you feel as though you know them and each one will touch your heart. The story begins as Katie, Diana, Steve and Wayne enter their senior year at their Christian high school and continues as they grow through their life experiences over the next two years. God's hand directs each character as they follow their dreams and survive unexpected events that change their lives forever. The last page will leave you longing for a sequel."
4,Great Purchase!!,"This is a wonderful book! It is the perfect book to have out on your coffee table. The 'Christmas Book' offers more than beautiful images, there are delightful poems, stories and songs that will be sure to be a great addition to your Christmas season. It was a the perfect book to have lying around at my eggnog party!!"
4,Great buy!,This is a great collection. The introductions on each event are done very well and make you interested in the fights (they all show a good back story and some controversy.) The extras are extensive and suprisingly interesting.
5,A great collection for any ufc fan,This collection is full of great fights. I would reccamend this for any ufc fan. includes great battles between liddel an couture.
1,just awful,Just terrible and not worth the money. The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill. Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.
3,Took forever to sprout!,"This came in promptly, but when I planted it it took about 3 weeks to do so. Other than that no other complaints."
1,Lousy,"I'm trying to use up these lousy nuts and get some decent nuts. If you like the flavor of almonds, don't get these. Emerald's flavorings cover up the nut taste. I tried Emerald's walnuts too. They are just as bad -- not much walnut flavor."
1,"YUCK, YUCK and YUCK!","First let me say I LOVE almonds. I like them raw, toasted, salted or not. I wasn't expecting the flavor of these at all. Very strong garlic and onion flavor that took me by surprise. I really tried to get past that and eat these but could not. Emerald should change the label to 'seasoned' almonds. Now I read all labels when I buy nuts so I am not disappointed again when I just want the flavor of the nuts and not all the seasoning."
3,Weak Representations of Lennon Works,"So I bought the triple disc edition of this to great disappointment.First of all, who ever had the bright idea of letting Lavigne do anything on this record is a joke, and needs to be taken away and forced to listen to her music until his head explodes.For the most part, the covers are weak. There are a few decent tracks, like The Postal Service, Regina Spektor, Green Day, and Ben Harper songs, but U2? Give me a break!I would buy this album for the charity and goodwill it brings, as well as for the image and meaningfulness of the late John Lennon, to make sure that it never dies, but apart from that, it is just another in a long line if crappy tribute albums."
1,Pass on this one....,"While saving Dafur is an extremely important cause, listening to this album is really difficult. Most, if not all, of these covers are really unimaginative, boring, tedious, plastic, crappily rendered. The only decent cover is Whatever Gets You Through the Night by Los Lonely Boys. It's just decent, not great, and the only reason I like it is because I never liked the fast tempo of the original. Los Lonely Boys slow it down, and get it in a nice groove. But that's the only good song. There are no great ones, and some are downright obnoxious. Steven Tyler's Give Peace a Chance is histronic, Aguilera's Mother has no feeling at all, REM's #9 Dream is boring, and Nobody Told Me is really bad, with a smarmy lead vocal on it. Avril's Imagine sucks, too. Like another reviewer here said, just give the money to Dafur. That's the best thing to do."
3,Average Karma,"This CD was disappointing. When you look at the list of artists: U2, REM, Snow Patrol, Jack Johnson, Postal Service, Ben Harper, Green Day, Jakob Dylan, and more, you think you are going to get a great album. But it's average at best. I loved the U2 and REM songs at the beginning, but even some of the artists I liked didn't do a great job. Definitely more misses than hits. I will admit that I didn't know any of these songs, except Imagine, so I'm not sure how faithful these covers are to the original. But they felt very bland. Luckily, I checked this CD out from the library, so I didn't waste any $$$. Of course, I guess it wouldn't be wasting since proceeds would go to a good cause, but you catch my drift."
5,Great songs for a Great cause,"I have to admit, there are some great versions of John Lennon classics. However there are some songs that weren't that great. The great standout songs include Jakob Dylan's version of ""Gimme Some Truth"", Green Day's ""Working Class Hero"", and Jack Johnson's ""Imagine"". The biggest miss in my opinion was Aerosmith doing ""Give Peace A Chance"". They were overshadowed on that song by Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars. Overall this is a must buy that will go for a great cause."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this CD after having heard the Jack Johnson version of ""Imagine,"" which I loved. Unfortunately, it turns out that that is the only song on the CD that I will ever actually listen to. (Why would they even put Avril Lavigne on there?)What it really comes down to for me, though, is that I would rather listen to John Lennon's own versions of his music any day."
4,Pat in NY,A money raiser for Darfur. Tribute album to John Lennon by various artists. Great music. good service. Would recommend this to anyone who likes John Lennon and wants to do a little good at the same time.
5,A fresh way to listen to old favorites,I love this CD! and I am hoping that the current artist's interpretations will bring on a whole new audience to John Lennon. As well it should.I highly recommend this to all.
3,"Not bad: Some good tracks, some I could live without","I generally avoid tribute or cover albums; they seem pointless unless the arrangements are substantially altered from those for the original recordings. However, I purchased this CD because I heard and loved Regina Spektor's version of ""Real Love."" It is better than the overdubbed version created for the Beatles Anthology, and more akin to the demo recorded by John Lennon's as heard on the Imagine film soundtrack. The rest the album, as others have said, is hit and miss. Nothing surpasses the original versions, but the material they are working with is so good, it is hard to do too much harm. The one exception is ""God,"" covered here Jack's Mannequin and Mick Fleetwood. The original is a centerpiece of one of the greatest albums of all time. Yet, if ever there was a song inappropriate for a cover version, this one has got to be it. The lyrics and point of the song simply do not lend themselves to being sung by anyone but John Lennon himself."
2,Why must saving the world be so disappointing?,"I bought this album because it supports Darfur, but was very disapointed. Out of the 2 disc set I liked 6 songs. Granted I'm not a huge Beattles fan, but many of the covers were just plain bad. Considering the wide range of talent on the album I expected something better. I encourage you to buy the album as a social statement and consider the cost a donation to support Darfur rather than an investment in your music collection."
1,Disappointed,I did not like any of the songs on these CD's but one. I found myself skipping to the next song. Only liked Green Day. All the other songs were way too dark and gloomy.
1,John turning in his grave,The results of the drug abused generation have turned John Lennon into this? A charity to strengthen terrorists and terrorism is basically what this is with consequences that we will suffer down the road. A Working Class Warlord is who will get these funds. But that doesn't feel good which is why the reality is hidden.But this is from the generation that lost its ability to reason to feel good all the time.
5,My nephew loved this Power Ranger Costume,"My nephew is 3 years old and the costume fitted perfectly on my nephew, not too big or too small just right! Although the mask was a little too big for him, but other than that the outfit looked good. The details on the costume looked exactly how it look on the the power ranger show my nephew watches. He had so much fun with this costume and just being a power ranger for one night."
2,Pass On This One,"This book is mostly a waste of money unless you are taking a class requiring this as a textbook. Why? Because it is written like a textbook! Every chapter ends with pages of great questions that remain unanswered because the only place to get the answer is a special order instructor's version. I am not taking a class. I foolishly expected it to be a complete teaching tool and business reference. There isn't even a disc included --a requirement for a book this expensive.For an understanding of Excel's data analysis features, skip this book. Instead, check out ""Data Analysis With Microsoft Excel"" a much better book with a great disc and a fantastic macro included. Some of the information in this book is useful but for the money look for a more comprehensive book."
3,Teacher recommended,Instructor recommended this book to use along with others in our class in order to learn additional concepts. Dry read.
4,Excellent Design Guide for Landing Gear,"Currey addresses almost all of the aspects of landing gear design. From basic gear geometries to dynamic analysis of the shock strut - the descriptions are clear and the illustrations accurate.With this book alone its possible to design a complete landing gear - well almost. Stress analysis, computer dynamic analysis and manufacturing processes are not covered in great detail in the book, nor should they be.Currey accurately describes what's involved in the preliminary design stages of landing gear."
4,"Not quite lithiums, but close","One of the best standard batteries out there. When you need extra juice but don't want to pay for Lithiums I find Duracells leak only a fraction of the time compared to other batteries also, which is a plus."
5,High Quality Adapter,"I bought this to replace my 25 year old SKIL adapter that walked off. The Bosch unit is just as nice, if not nicer for fit and finish."
2,Did Anyone Bother to Edit this Book??,"I think this would be a great book for anyone interested in training sheepdogs, but the editing is extremely messed up. Trying to read it is often like trying to decipher cryptic messages. It's too bad, as it has a lot of good information to offer."
1,Drive did not recognize the discs,"My Lite-On drive meets the required specifications for using these discs, but none of the discs are recognized. I even flashed my drive with updated firmware, but it still will not read or burn these discs."
1,Doesn't Work in ANY of My Drives,I have several of the latest DVD+-RW drives as well as DVD-Ram drives and this media doesn't work in any of 'em
5,A welcome reissue of one of Tete's best,"Superb mid-sixties (ca.1966) piano trio with Tete at or near the top of his form, with terrific chops and no scarcity of ideas, regardless of tempo. Some very interesting original material (Blues for Nuria is a standout.) Imaginative and tasteful backing from drummer Al ""Tootie"" Heath and bassist Peter Trunk.This was originally released on the German SABA/MPS label. If the sound quality on this reissue is as good as on the original vinyl disc, it should be up to (or better than) the standards of present-day recordings. Sure, it ain't cheap - but if you are a Tete Montoliu fan, by all means go for it!"
4,"an unfairly treated ELVIS "" movie.","from the very first time i saw this film, i've been convinced that Elvis can act as well as sing. Unfortunately, he was not given too many chances to do so. His performance is credible, noteworthy, and unforgettable. The up-state NEW YORK scenery is beautiful,the veteran actors also in the movie- GIG YOUNG, CHARLES BRONSON, ED ASNER, all give outstanding performances.The songs may have been few, KING OF THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD, I GOT LUCKY, etc, but still Elvis at his best.This movie is my favorite Elvis flick hands down. PLEASE MGM produce this movie on DVD FULLSCREEN AND WIDESCREEN 5:1 DOLBY DIGITAL . DO IT SOON, FOR I WANT TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION. THANKS,oldugly1911"
3,Hard-Hitting Presley Vehicle,"This 1962 remake of ""Kid Galahad"" provides a solid acting vehicle for Elvis Presley. Relatively few songs (mostly forgettable) as director Phil Karlson focuses on the boxing milieu. A stronger-than-average cast includes Gig Young, Lola Albright and Charles Bronson. Unfortunately, the film's moderate box-office success prevented Elvis from venturing into more dramatic territory - which is a pity, since he could deliver the goods when given half a chance.OVERALL RATING: ***"
5,ELVIS AND BRONSON!,"This is a fun Elvis Presley movie, where, being Irish and an Army veteran, Elvis, along with Charles Bronson, is fighting for the boxing championship, while battling corruption from the Mafia.Typical of Elvis, he spontaneously sings, while surrounded by adoring females, and all of us guys wish we were him!So far, I've purchased five (05) Elvis Presley movies, and used a couple of them to learn to sing a few of his songs (which I've recorded and posted on the YOU TUBE web site, and on my own personal web site, ""OUR ETERNAL STRUGGLE"")."
4,Only One Elvis Presley!,"Couldn't wait to get this on DVD. Great quality, no trailer though (which was on the VHS version). I thought Gig Young and Bronson did great in supporting roles. I love the music, the best song being ""Home is Where the Heart Is"". Joan Blackman was a fox...My other favorites post 1960 are Wild In the Country, Roustabout, Tickle Me."
1,"Nice music, poor quality product","I had this album on vinyl. Really like the music. Unfortunately, the CD is very poor quality, very scratched, and so distorted you can't stand listening to it. I threw it away and ended up downloading the songs I wanted most from Itunes. I do not recommend buying this as this is obviously a very poor product of duplication. The original vinyl sounds a lot better even with a few scratches!!!"
2,"Good for the basic stuff, nothing more","I had no install or functional issues with this product, however my complaint is this: for $19.99 this software should know armoire, stereo CD player, etc. Basically it has a database of the most common household and office items, nothing more. In the long run will it help you save more money? Maybe, depends on what you are trying to claim.I expect more from H&R; Block."
1,Buggy Software that Does Not Save Time,"After manually entering many ""non-cash"" items, I found the total amount for this category was not reflected in the summary page and shown as $0. The data would also not export to Taxcut. When contacted, the technical support ""help"" was to re-enter everything and if that did not work, to re-install the software. The software did not save me time - it doubled the time it would have taken to just enter the information directly into Taxcut."
3,USB Utility won't work on Windows 7,I have been very pleased with this phone system (purchased in 2007)until now (July 2012). The USB Utility for loading and maintaining the phone book on the handsets refuses to work now that I have a computer running Windows 7. I can't imagine why Panasonic would discontinue support for a product that is still in good working order.
1,Was not the best phone I ever owned.,"I purchased this phone also through amazon, forgot who I bought it from, but anyway, the phone I bought was a dud from the start, I could not download any of the features as stated, and what really pead me off, the phone only allows you to talk for 2 hrs, now that is a no-no, because when I get into a conversation I don't need my phone to tell me to hang upkind of reminds me when I was living with my parents, when I called the company, panasonic those people act like I just landed from mars, they did not have an idea of what I was talking about , so I never was able to use the features, I'm in the market for another talking id phone from panasonic, and the reviews I've read seemed to be pretty good, I'm leaningtowards the KXTG9333T, atleast they states you can talk for 5 hours."
2,Base Unit Stops Working,"The handsets (we have four, including the one in the base unit) work fine. But the buttons on the base unit (numbers, messages -- outgoing and incoming --- hold, intercom, volume control, etc. ) stop working within a very short time. Not a big deal unless you don't have a separate voice mail system (we do) or unless you want to add another handset. We've had two base units so far. We returned the first unit as it was still on warranty but in order to benefit from the warranty we had to send the unit in and wait for them to send us a replacement. It was a hardship as this is our only telephone and without the base unit the handsets don't work. So, unless we want to use a cheap spare unit while we send the second one back to the manufacturer we are stuck with a non-functioning base unit."
2,More of the same,"If you liked J. Robert King's Invasion Cycle, this is about status quo. Lots of annoying fourth wall breaking, lots of INCREDIBLY melodramatic prose that doesn't fit the setting, lots of choreographed violence. It's not as bad as the books that follow it, but it's not going to be winning any Locus or Nebula awards any time soon. This is the best of the Onslaught Cycle, but that's not really saying much. If you want thoughtless fight scenes and escapism that doesn't require a lot of thought, go with this book. If you need something a little more solid or thought-provoking, seek ye elsewhere."
4,Kamahl is Back!,"I was VERY pleased with this book. Kamahl was always one of my favorite characters and now he's back,and better. The fact that he's a druid is so cool. I have read many Magic books but this is one of the best. King is a great author who also wrote the Invasion Cycle (My favorite cycle)."
2,"The songs are ok, but the melody will drive you insane!","Well the songs were real nice. These are all the songs I used to sing as a kid myself, which I wanted to pass on to my daughter. Now from the first track till the last track the melody hardly changes. The music is purely electronic and the songs lost their beauty.I do not recommend this CD!"
5,A GREAT book for parents and those close to them!,"Since my son died, I have read many books about grief and this is the absolute BEST! This book also lets people who have not dealt with losing a child first hand, really understand what parents go through. It is an excellent book!"
5,An insightful journey of a child's death,"I was introduced to Joanne and her book through a friend who lost a child. With this book and her help, I was able to understand and better deal with the situation. Through ""Dear Cheyenne"", I understood what to say, and more importantly, what NOT to say, as it gave me a better understanding of their grief. I strongly recommend this book to anyone that has lost a child or knows someone who lost a child."
5,"After reading ""Dear Cheyenne"", I knew someone understood.","I received the book the week of my son's death. It was at a time that I felt so alone. I thought noone understood the pain that I was feeling. After reading ""Dear Cheyenne"", I learned that I was not alone. Just by reading this one book, I knew there WAS someone else who understood my feelings and my pain. This book has helped me realize that my feelings are natural, normal emotions. I would recommend ""Dear Cheyenne"" to all bereaved parents."
3,Design flaw makes the changing table nearly unusable,"For a strange reason the changing table is designed to be attached at the center of the play yard only when needed. It is very difficulty to attach / detach the changing table, and it is nearly impossible to have the baby playing inside when the changing table is attached, due to the limited space left. The changing table can not be used itself without attaching to the play yard. Many other play yards have the changing table on the corner BTW.Except this complain, we are very satisfied with the play yard. Its micro-fiber is of high quality and goes well with our other micro-fibric furnitures. I wish Safety 1st could correct this design flaw in its next version."
2,Ok Toy if you get it for CHEAP!,"Where do I begin? I had high hopes for this. My 3year old was excited for it. When it arrived, I was even heartened by the ""made in the USA"" sign. But it is CHEAP! The plastic pieces were all bent in the box, which was only partially fixable during assembly. The parts come stuck together with plastic that needs to be broken off. It's impossible to break off the plastic nubs cleanly - they're sharp! I had to cut them off with a box cutter. The item is only 1 shade of pink and not 2 like the photos show. It's flimsy and not as nice looking as the photos appear when assembled. My 3 year old thinks it's ok. I give it two stars instead of one because my 18 month old likes it a lot."
2,Cheap plastic and nightmare to assemble!,"I gave this 2 stars because it took 3 hours to assemble. I was dissapointed to see the plastic is very thin and cheap. Not as sturdy as the picture makes it look... so much so, that there was a plastic piece that was already broken when we opened the box! There are also very sharp ""knobs"" on the edges of each piece that actually cut my finger. All the pieces are stuck together with these ""knobs"" so you have to dissasemble each and every piece before you put it together, which leaves the sharp knobs still attached. My daughter loves it, however and this was her favorite gift this year for Christmas. Overall, I would NOT recommened this product. Get something more sturdy."
1,a trillion pieces,"The box has a trillion pieces in it. All of the pieces (plastic) are bent so screwing them into each other is nearly impossible. It was bought to give as a gift, we didn't give it to her because we couldn't get it together (And we've assembled a ton of toys/furniture in our time).The doors that you see with the little heart handles are just sitting in there and moving the thing will cause them to fall off."
2,AGHHHH!! What a pain in **** to put together,"Let me preface this by saying I am an engineer who has finished my own basement, installed bathrooms, wired anything.. This monster had 60 separate plastic pieces to put together- first time I saw a toy like this with a recommendation "" power screwdriver suggested"" -- the little play hand shower sprayer alone was 6 separate pieces... Some of the plastic was slightly deformed which made lining up the holes a real thrill-so one of the doors doesn't close properly.. and one hole did not survive- epoxy cement was needed to repair that one.I am sure my grand-daughter will like it- after an hour and a half of assembly, she had better!<G>..OOPSS - spoke too soon about the epoxy repair- this is made out of one of those plastics that epoxy does not adhere too- if superglue doesn't work I'll drill a hole and secure it with a machine screw and nut....."
2,Poor quality,"This was SOOO difficult to assemble, took forever. So many pieces of plastic and so confusing. It also looks pretty cheap. However, my girls love playing with it, so I am going to give this one to a friend, and instead just purchased the better looking, better quality white wood baby doll high chair and crib on amazon."
2,Not a great product,Took me over 1.5 hours to build this toy. There are so many pieces and almost all of them needed to be screwed into place. The material is very flimsy and not durable....overall very cheap. Each of the small pieces comes together on a grid like system...all of the pieces are attached by more plastic that you need to either cut or twist to get off. Which in turn leaves tiny pieces of plastic sticking out on the sides of the small parts. These are very sharp and need to be filed down so your little one doesn't scratch them self. My daughter does enjoy playing with this toy...but I would not recommend it. I would have rather spent a little bit more money on a better made product.
3,replacement parts:,hi our daughter loves this toy it is perfect for her and her dolls. we just recently moved and lost a few pieces. and she is so upset about it. so is their a website or anyway i can buy replacement parts. please email me at sippl_navy1983@yahoo.com
3,Pieces! Pieces! AND MORE PIECES!,"There is a neverending flow of tiny plastic pieces you get to cut/rip out of even more plastic packaging. Once you've unleashed the MOUND of plastic, you get to piece it together - one shard of plastic at a time. Still can't figure out how to get the sink to stay together, but my daughter doesn't seem to mind that she can't use the fake sink. The crib swings, the bathtub actually holds water if you feel like letting your child actually bathe their babies and there is actual, usable storage - which my 2 year old uses to keep her dolls in. Be prepared to devote a minimum of an hour (took me almost 2) to assemble. It really is a lot of pieces, but the end result seems worth it."
3,cute set if you can put it together,When we opened up the box my husband & I looked at each other & started cracking up! I've never seen anything like this. All of the tiny pieces were connected to other plastic. You have to pull them apart & then file down all of the sharp edges. It took seriously forever for my husband to put together. If he wasn't around and I had to do this by myself I would have closed the box back up & shipped it back to amazon!! Once everything was together & the sharp edges were filed down we were really pleased. My daughter really likes the set & she has a good time playing with it.
3,COULD THERE BE MORE PIECES PLEASE!!,"First of all, the only reason I give the Doll Center a 3 star review is because my daughter loves it. Upon opening the box you are greeted by a jumbled mess of plastic. Not too bad, except every piece is stuck to the plastic tree mold from hell. Is there any way to break the parts off this tree without leaving the little nub that somehow manages to scratch you every time? Besides the one-gazillion parts, do you think the plastic pieces could be of a little better quality? Maybe the instructions could be a little more...user friendly, for us Dads that are plastic toy assembly challenged. Bottom line, your child will enjoy this but, parents, be ready to be frustrated."
2,Poor quality,Took 2 hours to assemble. Pieces are molded to each other and have to be pulled apart (creating sharp edges) and then assembled. Very short for my 5 year old who loves dolls. Cute monitor. She likes the cupboards and the pretend sink. The cradle is very small and only fits small dolls. A disappointment.
4,Nice toy for the price...,I hated the assembly; many of parts didn't fit correctly (more than usual for this type of toy). But the price was fair and my daughter is getting lots of enjoyment out of it.
2,LONG Assembly process!,This toy came in so many pieces. It took my husband at least an hour to put it together. It was hard to screw some of the parts as they are plastic and bendable. My kids have not played with it much. I paid about $47.00 for this and saw it at Big Lots later for $20!
5,Nursery was a hit!,"I purchased this product for my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. Upon opening the box, was a bit surprised at all the pieces to assemble. My patient son-in-law tackled the job. Unfortunately, a piece that goes on the bottom was missing. No problem. I phoned the company I purchased it from and they sent the missing piece within a week. When my granddaughter saw her gift she was very excited. The toy is very educational and interactive. It was a joy to watch her having so much fun with her doll. I would highly recommend this toy for any little girl wanting to ""play mommie"". I give it 5 stars!!!"
4,Nightmare to assemble,"Although cute, this toy was a nightmare to assemble. When I opened the box, I was shocked to see a confusing jumble of plastic pieces all connected to each other. The first step was to separate everything, and I had to use an exacto knife to remove the plastic ""nubs"" left behind so they would not scratch my children. Next, I had to figure out the instructions (mostly pictures, not a lot of explanation). The pieces were all warped and did not fit together well, although once you screw them into place, it seems to work OK. It took about 2 1/2 hours to assemble....not a fun experience! The finished product is cute and I am sure my daughter will like it when she finds it under the Christmas tree."
3,"Great toy, Great Price",Fantastic Service! Arrived so so quick! Item is only 1 shade of pink and not 2 like the photos show but that's fine...my daughter will love it! Item quality is about right for the price! Perfect for a little one! My daughter is only 2 so she will love this when she gets it on Christmas day! I'm very happy and will use again! Many thanks
2,Really? I thought it was crap!,"So we had this toy for about 2 years, and with in a week of having it, the drawer and one leg broke. My child was not hard on it, barely used it. It was waaaaaaaaaaaay cheap which is why I got it on clearance for five dollars at another store. NOT worth the money in my opinion. It looks cute, a good size for lil kiddos, lots of items, but really cheap quality. Good luck with this product."
4,Granddaughters delight...,Bought this for my granddaughters 2nd birthday....the only complaint I have is that it has toooooo many pieces..I thought it would take me forever to put it together...I got my older grandson to put it together for me..he did it in about 2 hours...my littlest grand baby just loves to play with it & so does her 2 sisters (4&6)
2,"Kids love it, but it falls apart and cheaply made","Although my girls love this toy, I think it's cheaply made and has already broke in several places. The concept and idea would be great if it wasn't made out of cheap plastic. I'd even pay more to have it better quality."
5,Did not disappoint - 5+ toys in 1,"I ordered the nursery for my 22 month old grand-daughter. Assembly was time consuming - but well worth the invested patience. She loved the colors (her favorite) and it was just the right size and height for her to use. It will/has given her many hours of pretend, imaginative play with and without adult interaction. Will shop for more American Plastic products."
3,not as great as I hoped,"I thought my 3 year old would love this. It is very large and bulky and although it has everything in it, high chair, tub, crib and storage, she doesn't play with it as much as I hoped. She prefers the smaller crib and high chair that she can move around. It is very durable :)"
2,Not horrible but would not buy again if givin the chance,First off it comes in a hundred plastic pieces that you have to cut apart. Some of the pieces are kinda sharp and can cut while assembling. Its made very cheap compared to other baby cribs out there for around the same price. The directions aren't horrible but had to use the colored picture on the box to figure some parts out. The doors aren't the easiest or very quiet to open so if you have a spouse or siblings napping it might wake them up. It takes up a lot of space but is very short. My 3 year old loved it for about a week and now has no intrest in it. Im just going to give it to our local budget center and buy a wooden crib like the Badger or Mellisa and Doug versions.
5,perfect set for little mommy,"My daughter loves this set, it is just the right size for her bedroom, not too bulky. Assembly took about an hour though."
3,Plastic nightmare included,"Upon reading previous reviews, I have to agree.....It is the plastic tree from hell. My son in law put this together in an hour, lots of trimming for all of the pieces. My grand-daughter loves it. It is made for an 18 inch doll, and really is the perfect height for a 3-4yr old. I wouldnt recommend it for a child over 5yr."
5,Trace Marie's Favorite Gift,"My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loves spending her days playing ""babies"" in her new nursery. She especially likes the monitor and the different baby sounds that it makes and how the sounds change according to what part of the nursery she is using."
4,"Daughter loves it, really hard to put together","Our daughter (2 1/2) loves this! But her Dad and I thought it was SUCH a pain to put together and the plastic edges need to be filed down. Once it was finally done, it is a very sturdy, nice toy and a great deal for the price. But my husband told me to spend more next time on an already assembled one! LOL"
1,Don't waste your money,"Look for something better quality...this is the cheapest thing ever! Yes the pieces are all attached and it's a pain to tear them off...it's also time consuming and flimsy, things don't fit together and it very difficult to get all the screws in properly. I am so frustrated and very disappointed, i should've spent the extra cash on a wooden set...this one is not worth it."
1,This toy pack it wrong!,"Although the toy is very nice, I had the bad luck that poorly packed, I bought two, one for my daughter and one for my niece, the box of toys not packed well, so that the toy will hit and damage."
2,not the sharpest tool in the shed,The blade is smaller and duller than expected. I used this to start the circle and finished with a jabsaw.Not sure if there are any replacements for the the blade.
3,grit stone bonanza,"A prerequisite for reading this books is that you are at least interested in rock climbing in general, and even better if more specificly British gritstone climbing in the Peak District. Although there are some detours to the Alps, Patagonia and, most notably, Annapurna in Himalaya, this is mostly about climbing gritstone.This book is probably bit to nerdy about the rock climbing for the average reader. Also it does not contain the amount off-the-gritstone anecdotes about Whillians the brawler as the title and cover suggests.Still I got through, and found it well worth the effort. The portrait of Whillians goes against a background gallery of other notable climbers from the era, and gives a good presentation of the times and the characters.And at least now I know where the Peak District is."
2,slow start,"I guess I thought this would be more of a full climbing book. The endless chapters at the beginning discussing Whillans school days and early work history put me to sleep. I guess this is more of a character biography, a character best left unexplored."
4,"Nice, can't be beat for the price",It has three of the little symbols on it. My understanding was that the symbol (the hands with the heart) when faced one direction meant the person was taken and when faced the other direction the person was not. Well two of the symbols face one direction and the third faces the other.
3,Cute but...,"I bought this ring as a Valentine's gift but couldn't give it since the hands holding the heart symbol would reverse whenever the ring spins (there are 4 of them on this ring, alternating the facing direction). It's a cute ring so I just kept it for myself."
3,Incorrect charger,The charger didn't work for the bluetooth. It said that it was compatible with the model #. It arrived in a timely manner and the seller accepted it back without a problem.
2,(Gold) King - Economy lot,"Back from the laundry: the colour has slightly faded, the fabric is nice and soft, the fitted sheet is rather too shallow to even reach the bottom corners of the mattress and the flat sheet is too narrow (8-10cm on each side) to line up with the comforter's sides."
3,Great concept; some information is incorrect.,"This book is a great concept with, in general, a good execution. But, as I toured the east coast a month or so ago, some of the information in the book was incorrect. There was a mangled URL, an incorrect phone number, and passages about museums which haven't been built yet. I found this book and tried to make a vacation of it; but after being misrouted to 2 of the 5 spots by this book, I wouldn't put 100% faith in it. But I also suppose that's part of the nature of these small museums, and why we have to visit them when we can; you wait, and they're gone."
4,Good Effort but Getting Out of Date.,Small museums don't last forever. So this book is getting a little out of date - however - this is a good book still. I have read it twice and still use it as a resource. I hope the author makes a new edition. If you like visiting small museums and stuff - get the book.
3,Worthless in the real world**(see edited section of review),"I now understand why large corporations are confused. This book has many pages of verbiage with even more useless graphs. Perhaps corporate vice presidents who need to justify their existence can wave this book around and generate reams of computer reports to wade through while their corporate bosses walk down the halls, but as far as creating a practical working program forget it. I would like to have my money back.**************** Hold the presses!This guy David J. Cichelli just gave me a call! I will say one thing for him. He is sincere and extremely intelligent. After a warm friendly conversation he helped me with my plans. So I don't want my money back after all! In fact I definitely will be looking for him to write some industry specific books in the future. I truly wish him well."
2,Detoxifying Spa /foot bath,"I compared with one in a hotel in Africa where I saw this product for the first time and the one I received does not work well. The colours change but i dont see the fatty substance, froth, etc, as I get when I use one in another place. I have now relocated to my duty station in Africa and therefore unable to either return or get a better one."
5,A beneficial product,"I have been using this product for 7 months. I have suffered with joint pain, stiffness, edema, etc., for quite some time. Over my period of use, it has greatly improved my feet and joint pain. It is supposed to draw the body's toxins out through your feet. It is much cheaper to buy your own spa than to get it done at the salon for $45/30 minutes. I ran it once without my feet to see what would happen, and the water remained clear. When I run it with my feet in it, the water gets dark and cloudy. It is simple to use and to clean up. You do need to purchase refills every so often because the array eventually stops working, and you also run out of liners and salt. I am very happy with it."
1,This unit is bogus,"This unit and it's advertising is totally bogus. When I tested the until without my feet in it, it became the same merky brown color as it did with my feet. I did several experiments using distilled water and different types of salt, without my feet in it, and it still came out the same. I have experience with commercial ionizers at a holistic clinic I go to. The EB Pro is a unit I have used for a long time. Very expensive to purchase.I am so surprised at the deceptive advertising as well as the deceptive unit. Try this yourself if you have the unit. Run it without your feet in it and watch the brown color come out of the Array (center unti).This is probably the most disappointing product I have purchased from Amazon."
2,stopped working,"I purchased this product around Dec. used it 2or 3 it worked g reat, went to use it now in July and it won't work the timer goes off as soon as you set it and the water turned murky brown but nothing else was happening . No one wants to give me answers So Buyer Beware"
1,Bogus product; bogus claim; bogus science.,Please do not purchase the Ion Detoxifying Foot Spa thinking that you will really benefit from it.Water will turn brown regardless of whether your feet are in it or not because the electrical charge going through the cartridge produce rust!It's a SCAM!
3,for collectors,"Yes, it has archival footage I've never seen before, but wouldn't watch this too often - once every few years? It also has a somber narrator. Why? I suppose there are many narrative styles that may have been annoying, but a little bit more energy would have been better. And you don't really have to try and create a point and keep pushing it home repeatedly, let the viewers decide."
4,great tool,Thanks to Amazon I've found a useful tool to mesure angle inclination and more. And the price is just right.
3,level,"works fine, didnt realize this one didnt have a magnet so I ended up gluing the magnet back into the old one and use this as an extra. may add magnets to this one as well"
5,Excelent,"C'est un bon appareil, assez précis pour faire la job de mesurage qu'on lui demande.Une étoile de plus pour la qualité-prix."
3,A slope indicator that is not truly level,This level tool does not indicate a true zero degrees on a level surface. If you need a true level tool buy a bubble level and test it before leaving the store.This Pitch locator is acceptable for my purpose. I use it when making photographs of paintings where I need the slope angle of the painting to match the slope angle of camera's sensor. The readings need to be the same and the fact that the tool does give a true zero is not significant in this usage.
3,Accurate,"This thing is accurate, not very durable. Later I found better products at my local hardware store for the same price. I thought I was getting a deal...prices on these measuring devices has dropped. Check out your hardware store or Home Depot."
4,Great tool for easily determining slope and pitch.,"Very easy to use. I recently put in a new drain pipe and wanted to ensure I maintained proper slope over some very uneven ground, This tool made it very easy. I used it in conjunction with a laser and finished the job in no time at all."
3,"Cute, but nothing special.","If you want a fun, fluffy read, this is it. The characters were fairly good, the story OK, minor characters were interesting, but had no presense, and were completely dropped much too soon. The inaccuracies were there, but not such a big deal in such a non-serious, light book.It didn't stand out to me, either good or bad, but was somewhere in a gray area of ""entertaining, but unremarkable."""
2,A disappointment,"I was sorely disappointed in this book, expecting something more after reading several reviews. I found it to be choppy, with poorly developed characters thrown into contrived situations. The ""hero"" sporadically swung between spoiled child stubbornlly wielding his power, with no concern for his own life, to sensitive man learning to enjoy the simpler things in life in forced comedic situations. No matter how good-looking the author wrote him to be, I just couldn't find him attractive. The ""heroine"" was equally unlikeable."
2,Flat characters!,"I was very disappointd! It has been a very long time since I had the misfortune of reading a book with such a one-dimensional hero! Adam Romero is just not realistic. He is not old enough to have forgotten what it was like to be in college and having to ""rough"" it a little. You can understand the griping at the beginning, but when it is still going on at the end it's just a little too much! Additionally, Alex comes from Cuban descent and is really concerned with human rights activities - I can honestly tell you a person such as this would not be as hung up about clothes and food as he was! They make a point of his heritage at the beginning and then it is completely dropped fpr the stereotypical corporate millionaire persona. It was a great disappointment!"
1,Romeo falls flat....,This was an incredibly unbelievable attempt at writing a interesting book. The jacket cover was more interersting than the book. The characters were shallow and the dialog was ridiculous. Definately not worth the ($$$) I paid to read it.
2,Not as funny as the reviews make it seem,"After reading several reviews, I tore into it the minute it arrived. I expected laugh-out-loud reactions to this book (""hilarious read"" etc). Did not happen. It was passable. The characters were rote, forced... the plot predictable. The ""action"" non-existent. I swore I would gag if I read one more comment about ""the Academy"" and the heroine's ""duty."" She's a Fed guarding a JKFJr clone. We get it! It had amusing parts. Put together, it did not amount to a great read."
4,Makes you feel good about choosing to stay at home.,"Overall, I really liked this book. It addresses the mixed feelings you may experience by transitioning from working full or part time to staying at home with your children and points out the good feelings you will experience by making the choice to do so. Although there are a few chapters that point out obvious and sometimes extreme ways to save money while at home, most of the chapters revolve around coping with your mixed feelings, obtaining support that stay at home moms need and acknowledging God's guidance as you stay at home during the most important season of your childrens' childhood. Easy and quick to read... I recommend it for anyone planning to stay at home or just merely thinking about it."
3,"Great, but...","I first played this game when it was originally released and it is the ONLY computer game that I have ever liked. Unfortunately, it had a few bugs and you needed to download ""patches"" to make it work.The other thing is that the game was designed to run on Windows 3.xx and it just plain doesn't work on a modern computer without a huge amount of fussing around. I would have liked to give it the five stars it deserves but since I can barely get it to run on my XP computer (and I suspect not at all on anything later) I have to down rate it.A shame, really, as it IS an excellent game. If only it could be revised to run from a single DVD and on a later OS."
1,Very disappointing,"I am very disappointed with this software. All the negative things that people have said about it are true. I have used it for a few (wasted) hours, and this is what I've found:---It is very difficult to navigate the software. It is not intuitive. I am an experienced computer user, I've even used Fritz before, but I could not figure out this software.---It is very cumbersome to set it up to review a game you've played, which is what I mostly wanted to do.---This software is not just difficult, it is BUGGY! There are many functions in the program for which there is no ""Help"" at all! I tried the openings trainer, and the openings are all named in a foreign language! (Polish?) There is an option to delete games from the database, but it doesn't work! And so on.My advice: don't buy this software. You can analyze your games with a good engine (Fritz 6) and small database (12,000 games) using the free program ""Chessbase Light"". I recommend it."
3,still needs work,"I bought deep fritz because I was already familiar with Chessmaster and I wanted to see what Fritz had to offer. From some of the other reviews I,d already gathered that they both can be buggy. I also read a review on Fritz that parts of it were in German and that the user could not get that part of the program to work in English. I ignored that because after a review like that surely they will have fixed it by now. Nope. I still give the program 3 stars because it has an excellent engine and does most of what it says. It is ""not"" user friendly. I know this program was capable of more than I was able to figure out in the short time I had it. So buyer beware. They may ""not"" have fixed the little idiosyncrasies. But if they haven't you can always return it. On a side note, I have a feeling Shredder may be a better, more stable program but it may cost a little more."
4,my review,"I got this game yesterday from gamestop, and man it is cool! only one problem, some times when you press move now, it doesn't, and it will switch sides on you, so if you started out the game contolling the white army, now you'll be contoling the black army. but this isn't to bad, just don't hit the move now button to quickly and be patient. overall I'd say this is a good game, with a good chess engine, the AI has many different levels of diffuculty, I've been playing chess for 7 years and am only using level two of six! this also has very nice 3-D chess sets, and also a 2-D mode. also has very helpful tips for beginers. very good game, i would definatelly recomend it for any one who plays chess, from a beginner to a an FIDE grandmaster."
4,"Awesome Chess Engine, But...","Deep Fritz is an incredible chess engine. The big thing it lacks is training and mentoring. I have been out of the game of chess for a while and wanted to work on and sharpen my chess skills. Playing Deep Fritz for me was like going from T-Ball to the Major League overnight! When Deep Fritz recognizes you're not a high level player, it will reduce its level of play though. I did end up getting Chessmaster as well which does have an incredible training and mentoring component to it (IMHO). The difference in engine strength between the two is very noticeable (Fritz being much better) but Chessmaster has much more flexibility in how you can use it to train and learn. My bottom line opinion: If you're an expert, Deep Fritz is your best bet. If you're a beginner even up to an expert, Chessmester may be a better option. Oh, one other thing about Chessmaster: you do indeed have to keep the disk in the drive to use the software - get with the times Ubisoft!"
1,Not for the beginer.,This product is not for the begining chess player. Interface is dificult to use. Find a free chess program and save your money. The manufacturer claims this is a training aid. Bull!
5,Kick back and enjoy!,I just happened to come across this cd on amazon. It was only $.25! How great is that! So i got it and was totaly blown away. I felt like i was on some island and everything just melted away. If i could recomend... PLEASE BY IT!!! Im still trying to find other stuff that is like her.
5,Easy & Fast Exercise Ball Air Pump,Great pump-takes seconds to inflate lots of different sizes of exercise balls. I highly recommend it--the pumping motion is very smooth. It really great quality at a very reasonable price!
2,the equipment was advertised as needing a pump to go with it?,I ordered a Ergo ball on wheels and it was advertised as needing an air pump to utilize the ball. I ordered both as a package deal. When I received the ball on the wheels it already had a pump that came with it. So I don't need this additional one and haven't opened it as of yet.
5,Wow! The best air pump ever!!!,I used this pump to add air to my stability ball-wow! It was so easy to use! It took me under one minute to pump up the ball to the firmness I needed. What a great investment I made:-). I threw out that cheap and lousy foot pump that came with my 75cm stability ball. This air pump is a keeper. Buy it. You won't be disappointed. Now I can do my chest/back exercises w/o having to purchase a bench- Yeah!!!!
3,just average,"it pumps air two ways, but it seems to be very difficult after some time. it is just an average one"
4,Pump it up!,If you have an exercise ball you need this pump. It does all the work for you in half the time of those dinky foot pumps that come with most exercise balls. I highly recommend this item!
5,Perfect for inflating stability ball!,Many stability balls come with a manual pump that takes forever to fully inflate. This pump works to inflate the ball when you are pushing down AND pulling up on the lever. It inflated my 65 cm ball in about a minute! I am not an incredibly strong person either.
5,Thanks Nicky!,"Nicky, you, your counting book and jazz lullabies cd are number one with me and my three little nephews. Thanks for helping me during my first babysitting effort with them! We acted out your 123 book with swinging, sliding, counting, and bopping amidst lots of fun and laughing. Then, we relaxed with your wonderful selection of jazz lullabies that calmed us all many times throughout the day."
4,Great novel by underrated author,"Milan, 1960. A fifty year old man, single and with a comfortable economic position, goes to a brothel. There he meets a new prostitute, about twenty years old, called Leide, to whom he becomes immediately smitten (despite the fact that she is not, in his own words, particularly attractive). They become lovers, he falls for her obvious lies, he spends a lot of money on her, despite knowing that she sees a lot of other men. He knows he is being taken by a fool by her, but he just can't cut his ties to Leide. As time goes by, Leide increasingly humiliates him with her behavior. The plot is not terribly fresh, and the protagonist even quotes the Blue Angel to explain his predicament. But this potent book (originally written in 1963, and a best seller in Italy at the time) ought to be better known today. Italian Author Buzzati (1906-1972) is in my opinion incredibly underrated as he was one of the most important European authors of the 20th century."
4,Comfortable but thin,"Pretty good. Although they're very comfortable (esp. thru seat and thighs), the material is a bit flimsier than I'd like. If it were an ounce or two heavier, the trousers would be perfect."
4,"Waist fits great, a little long!","I bought these for my husband as he needed new pants for his new fire department shift. They are great quality and the fit is great around the waist but the length is a little off. I ordered him a 32 inseam and they came to be about a 34, though the tag states 32. No biggie as he likes them longer than shorter. He got the navy blue which is a great color for stains and dirt. He really likes the pockets too."
2,"Honey, I shrunk the pants!","Got myself a pair for work around the house, but out of the bag they have a very unpleasant plastic feel on the skin. So I washed them before first use. The label says wash cold - work pants to be washed cold? We are talking dirt, grease, sweat, mud- you name it, they'll see it. So wash cold is not an option in real life now, is it. Surely the manufacturer is being over cautious here, right? So I washed my pair at 40C (about 100F), warm, not even hot. I put a 34"" waist into the machine and got a 30"" back out. I did plan on a diet after New Year, but 4"" is probably somewhat overly optimistic. So I got a brand new utterly useless pair of very cool pants for work I'll never do (in them anyway..). It's true I did not follow the manufacturers instructions, but in all fairness that is not what I expected to be told. ""You can use out great pants only once, because there really is no way to clean them after that weekend in the garden."" A stupid product."
2,Improperly Sized Product,"These pants were improperly sized (i.e., they were marked as a 34"" waist, but were actually a 36"" waist). Beware."
2,Sizing problem,Seems these pants run a little big and a little long (or maybe everything else I by in this size and style run small)
2,Very dissatisfied with the product description.,"Now Dickies are Dickies, however I selected Dark Navy Dickies Pants which was a part of a larger product for a fleet uniform job I'm working on where branding is key. So the color of the pants was very important. When I received this apparently Dark Navy means BLACK and not remotely similar to blue and returning this product has been a hassle."
2,not made for humans,"The material and looks of the pants are decent thus giving it 2 stars but I don't know what man could fit into these pants properly. I normally wear between a 30 and 32 waist, I even own dickies loose fit carpenter jeans which fit fine and are 32 x 32. These pants i could barely button but the legs are so large they look like parachute pants. These pants are made for people with thighs as wide as their waist. Loose fit legs are one thing but these are clown pants."
4,cargo pants,"They are a good product, not exactly what I wanted, but a close copy of it. I like the Levis relaxed cargo better just beacuse the cargo pockets (which I use extensively) were a bit larger. I like them though and will probably buy another pair."
5,Great value,For the price these are great value. Well made and good quality material - I have paid 4 times this much for inferior products.
3,32x32 was great fit in the waist but to long,"The quality and shipping of the product was well done, but when I put them on, alas they were just to long. And I mean by 2 inches to long. I couldn't make them work so I returned them."
3,Great pair of pants,"Well made pants that look nice. They don't exactly fit loose. I bought my husband's normal size for jeans, and they fit a bit tight."
3,Not bad for stimulant-free,"These worked pretty well during my stimulant-free phase. I dropped from 196lbs, with roughly 16% body fat, down to 190lbs @ 14%, though it did take a little longer than I prefer (around 3 weeks). But stimulants are really only a problem if they're abused anyway, so now I just go for gold and drop a coupleBELDT - Force Thermogenic. The results are way better/faster and worth the added stimulants. But again, if you're going pure (and have the patience), Universal won't disappoint."
2,not too bad,ok this pills are like horse pills and they say take four a day .for some people that can be alot but that didnt bother me.its the way it makes made me feel.always thirsty and stomach didnt feel right at times.like it was clogged.only used for 2 days just decided i could deal with how it was making me feel.the good thing was i wasnt very hungry with it and i needed it more for stopping my late night eating.so it does supress eating.overall i give it a two not made with product becasue i didnt pay alot for it and i'm selling them to a friend.didnt work like any other fat burner ive had and i've taken alot over the years.if you want to try go for it.i will not be using again happy training everyone.
5,A Great Album from the Most Talented Voice of the KLF,"A terrific album from the KLF's Maxine Harvey. Hopefully, the label will reissue this title and amazon.com will list is as a related artist to the KLF... as the voracious fans of the latter would definitely enjoy owning this very entertaining record."
2,feverfew,"I was dissapointed with the seeds, I planted half of the packet in by the current feverfew plant to expand the site and the rest in miracle gro starter and nothing happened despite my watering."
5,Powerful Little Multi-Media Devotionals,"Love this series! All have a humerous and entertaining audio story that introduces the month's theme. Included on the CD is a contemporary style Christian song as well as a Drive Time discussion for parents only. Reading material: There are 4 weeks' worth of family discussion starters that: Define the virtue, Evaluate why it is important, Encourage each other when caught using the virtue, and Decide what you think about the virtue. Those are great to do over/after dinner. Then 4 Bible stories, each with suggested bible readings, tidbits, and discussions for parents and kids. Each month also includes a memory verse, and special cards to write messages for your children. There is a contemporary style Christian song and a Drive Time for parents on each CD as well."
4,Good Book,This book is the account of several people who lost their lives diving to the extreme depths of the Andrea Doria. I shows how simple accidents turn fatal during extreme diving.
2,Worst of the Andrea Doria accounts.,"Having read most of the accounts of diving on the Andrea Doria and other deep diving sites I can say that this is the worst of the lot. The author is not a diver and admits it but obviously has not taken the time to have his work checked. Several references to ""1-2 knots per hour"" leave the reader wondering if the author has spent anytime on the water at all. Also some technical goofs where author makes clear he did not really understand some of what what communicated to him. Most aggravating is being left not knowing the outcome of the legal actions taken with regards to accidental drowning of Chris Murley. It was as if 1 or 2 chapters were missing from the end. Still some pretty good accounts of the mishaps aboard the Seeker from 1998-2001 as well as a reasonable retelling of the Andrea Doria sinking. In the end it is a worthwhile read as long as you look into the other books in this genre."
2,Accurate but disappointing,"I had just finished Shadow Divers when I jumped into Fatal Depth. That's a shame because Shadow Divers so overwhelms FD that a completely unbiased review may not have been possible.Haberstroh knits together the string of fatal dive incidents using the state of mind of dive boat captain Dan Crowell as the unifying thread. This attempt, though, turns up so little that the incidents really have to stand alone. As such, they seem like little more than incident investigations with perhaps a bit of background color for each of the victims. The author seems to have had no particular agenda and draws no conclusions. Even the status of a lawsuit described in the book's closing chapters is left unresolved.If you want a STORY, ready Shadow Divers. If you want research material on deep diving fatalities or just cannot get enough of the genre then by all means pick up Fatal Depth."
1,boooooring!,"I actually had to forcefully keep my eyes open to finish reading this book. If you have read The Last Dive or Shadow Divers, you know that these books both share an immediacy and drama that reads like a novel. These are up-all-night page-turners that will leave you breathless. Fatal Depth was written like a summary of the author's short magazine articles about the events described; the book reads like the Coast Guard's accident files, lacking utter poignancy or interest. There is no attempt at defining the divers' characters or motives; as a result, we find ourselves feeling sorry for the victims but all the while unmoved by their two-dimensional profiles. Save your money and instead buy the aforementioned books. On a side note, this book's editing, as has been noted elsewhere, is aweful, inexcusable given the major publisher and the author's credentials"
5,The Culture of Extreme Sports,"""Fatal Depth"" tells five stories, each one about the death of a scuba diver pursuing an extreme version of the sport - diving on the wreck of the Andrea Doria. The personalities and circumstances of the divers vary, but the stories, taken together, provide a fascinating and multi-faceted look at the culture of extreme sports in general. What attracts people to extreme sports? To take unnecessary risks? And what are the consequeneces to the survivors when the gamble doesn't pay off? If you liked ""Into Thin Air"", chances are you will like this book also."
1,Pounding square pegs into round holes,"I hestitated before buying this book. It was by someone who worked at a one of those tax deductible foundations suposededly dedicated to improving the planet for their fellow man. Then it was published by St. Martins a house big in quick read mysteries not non fiction books offering social political economic etc. commentary. Well the writer of this book is constantly twisting facts to fit his preconceived conclusions or to say it another way, pounding square pegs into round holes. I am going to demand my money back so I can buy something that dosen't insult my intelligence. I wonder who wrote all those all those five star reviews. I guess you know who."
3,"handy, practical, and (usually) easy to follow","A brief guide to the basic knots every camper should know. Left-handed illustrations are unique. Generally well illustrated with clear, step-by-step tying diagrams. Starts with a good introduction to types of rope and their care.The author's knot and rope nomenclature is not always consistent with most authorities, and a couple of the illustrations are either incorrect or difficult to follow. One gets the impression that author and illustrator failed to communicate under deadline pressure.Nevertheless, a handy little book that's easy to throw into your pack or glove compartment."
3,"Generally useful, sometimes difficult to follow","Cliff Jacobson's second edition of this book is, by and large, a very handy field guide. Most of the illustrations are easy-to-follow, but some are infuriating and frustrating. As a plus for left-handed folks, he includes how-to diagrams for them, too.Jacobson starts out with some basic rope care guidelines, and how to select the right rope for the task. He then goes over the 10 most useful knots, and then moves on to more complex and less-often-used knots. There's a small tear-off card with a few handy knots on it that's easy to slide into a pocket or pack. The book itself is fairly small and thin, too, but probably larger than I'd want to take on a long hiking/camping trip.By and large, it's useful; but I have a sneaking suspicion that there are better knot-tying books out there, with better diagrams (especially for beginners.) I gotta say it again; I got *really* frustrated with some of Jacobson's."
4,Nice Reference Book,"I fancy myself as a sort of lowbrow renaissance man, and have a diverse library of reference books. This is my book of choice when it comes to knots. I found the author's choice of knots to be a nice collection of knots that can be used in the everyday real world. The Power-Cinch/Trucker's Knot was worth the price of the book alone. This is an awesome little knot that I now use all the time when securing my canoe to the top of my vehicle, or tying down a load. It's great to see the ""how did you do that?"" look on other people's faces, too, when they watch me tie something down. This is a nice little book."
3,"It's Shea, but can't say it's oil..","It is shea butter, but can't say is is oil in anyway. Arrived quickly, but had to get out of the bottle because it is a typical shea butter. Not sure why it is called oil..?"
2,Not What I Expected,"The African Shea Oil was not what I expected. I expected an oil, but the product was creamy like a moisturizer. I suppose this is because shea oil crystalizes once it sits for a while. I would have liked to have known the texture of this item before buying it, because I was expecting an oil. The oil is oderless which is good, but before buying, be sure that you want ""shea oil"", and not shea butter or any type of natural oil."
2,Better off with regular shea butter,"So, as someone who loves all natural products from the earth and as someone who is in love with African shea butter, I expected this oil to sort of be as good as shea butter, just in oil form. I'm not sure what this is. It's super thick and oily, but just not as efficient as shea butter. It's a little grainy too.It has zero moisturizing properties like other oils like coconut oil or olive oil. It's straight up greasy- doesn't absorb well into the skin or hair shaft. I really wanted to like this product, but I just don't. 2 stars for effort though because ""shea oil"" sounds cool."
4,Recommend,I used this product on my daughters hair which stated dry and mine as well. Using this product has brought my hair to being natural
3,is it worth your money?,It's ok. At first I was impressed that it worked but then after a week or two I saw that it didn't really solve the problem especially on my legs. Even though it didn't solve my problem I still use it on my elbows. would I recommend it? I would because i still think it's better than some of the lotions I've used before.
4,Great for skin and hair!,"Shea butter is an excellent product in itself, but having it in a 100% Pure oil stage is great for rubbing in the skin right out of the shower to lock in that moisture. My daughter has extremely dry skin that can be very rough on her legs. I use it for her twice a day and her skin is softening so nicely. This is also great for hair right after it's been shampooed and wet. Just a few drops rubbed into the ends keeps the hair nicely conditioned and soft. With a family of 5 this bottle looks like it will last us about 3 months total and I will definitely be reordering and keep this in stock...this has replaced our lotions."
1,Misleading,"It's nothing like what I read in the reviews. And doesn't do anything exactly what I read. It didn't even make my hair soft. So I was really disappointed. I accidentally spilled it on my bathroom counter. My counter is granite and for some reasons it accumulates a powdery substance that I can't get rid of. My husband says it's the minerals from the water. Well, I wiped it on the counter and it got rid of it. So now I use that on my bathroom counter top and the powdery stuff stays away. So I give it 1 star for hair and 5 stars for counter revival stuff. Too funny."
5,Absolute perfection,"No need to ever buy any other lotions or creams. This works for my husband's extra dry AA skin that drinks other lotions, my daughter's sensitive skin, and my uber-white skin which does not handle lotions well. I have psoriasis as well and this softens the patches. No greasy feel."
5,Nice product..,Feels nice on my natural hair and scalp. Not too oily and has a decent smell. Will continue to purchase.
5,i absolutely love it,i have a lot of skin allergies and can't use most cosmetic stuff from stores. but this oil is wonderful for around my eyes and little spots that are bothering me
4,"Pricey shipping, but excellent product","My kids have mild eczema and I think the shea butter oil works well in any season. The quality of the product was great and was delivered quickly. However, the shipping is pretty pricey given such a small quantity."
3,"Great for nightly use, but...","This product is fantastic straight out of the bottle, but I add a few drops of essential oils to wear my favorite scent all day long. (You only need a couple drops else it can be heady in this fragrance free oil.)The oil goes on thick almost like castor oil, but is not shiny. However it is greasy enough to overwhelm makeup so I would not recommend it for use during the day. Also my sister, who is very sensitive to fruit and nut extracts broke into hives.We use virgin coconut oil during the day instead. It is surprisingly grease free and light. The skin absorbs it right away. The shea does seem to moisturize better though.All in all we are glad to rid of extra chemicals absorbed through the skin every day - so we will still use this and buy more if need be. However I was seeking an oil that would fulfill both daytime and nightly usage. The search continues."
1,Not moisturizing enough for dry skin,I have dry skin and intend to use it as a body oil/lotion. It is not moisturizing enough for me and my skin can still get dry and ichy in the evening. I purchased slice of nature shea butter later and that works perfectly for me.
3,OKAYFORSTARTERS,it felt good on my hair but i find it is most likely watered down and leaves ur hair more oily than moisture.
2,Doesnt work for eczema,The only thing this particular Shea oil did was oil up my hair and scalp. It did not work for helping with my eczema at all which is what i purchased it for.
1,garbage,"It only worked a few times (3). Each like 20 minute sessions. At first it was good, but when it stopped there was only enough light coming out from the LED for one key"
1,Unreliable,"This product only lasted for a couple days, I would not recommend it to anyone since the product is not made with good quality and the stand tilts the USB port plug either way, I am not satisfied with this product. In addition, the light does not illuminate to all the keys on the keyboard, it only illuminates on the center of the keyboard. If you're looking for a keyboard illumination and do not have back-lit keys, then I would suggest looking for another product."
4,"Convienient, useful, overall helpful","I like this light mainly because of it's USB connectivity. It's really convenient, and I don't have to worry about batteries. I just wish the beam were wider than this little single light provides. I find myself adjusting it to shine directly where I want it allot. Regardless, I will use this thing for a ling time!"
2,Too Dim! Too Short!,"I expected much bighter lamp than this product delivers. I have a 2 cell (3 volt) MAGLITE Flashlight, and expected equal or better brightness from 5 volt USB connection. Also, overall length seems shorter than product sales image."
5,flexible light for laptops.,what can I say but thank you. I can see clearly now without waking my husband. he loves it to.
1,Worked for 4 hours then went dead,"Plugged it in, nice light from single bulb, but after 4 hours of use it died. Does not work with any USB port. I would not buy this product again."
1,Broken after 3 weeks,"While I was browsing for laptop accessories, this item popped up. I ordered as it was not expensive and looked very cool. I got it through US mail (paid more on shipping than the lamp itself), but it really only worked for 3 weeks. It could not light up at all, even when it was working, it only lighted a small area on my laptop. Basically, it is not worth it at all. Don't waste your money on this product."
3,Exactly as pictured good for the price,"This item ships from China, so shipping time estimates are tripled; this one arrived about a 1 week ahead of the estimated time. Packaged sufficiently in bubble envelope. It works as intended Is a good item for the price two dollars and fifty cents. It's a sturdy piece of equipment not flimsy. I would perfer more light however this is exactly as described. The free shipping is a plus.If you need more light you may one to order one of the LED lights that contain multiple cells."
2,I bought this because it was cheap...,"...it would probably work better if I had a PC notebook, ...having said that it would still have this distracting glow at the end of the lite which I covered up with some black electrical tape, it really doesn't work for me, ...Even if I had a PC notebook, ...the light doesn't cover all of your keyboard and I find myself having to move it around. I got it because I have a black keyboard that is hard to see in the dark and I don't want to turn on a big light to see it."
5,elbonbon,"this USB LITE is awesome. I like it cause its portable, flexable and easy to use. but my only problem is that my girlfriend liked it also that she took it and keeped it for herself, so no i have to buy another one next month lol..."
5,Excellent Light from Amazon,"This light is very flexible. I was able to clamp it to the top of my laptop screen with a standard binder clamp and since the cord is a metal type that is flexible, I can aim the light to where I want and it will stay there."
1,Don't bother with this!,"This products are worthless and a sure source of wastage. The light from the device could not even illuminate the keyboard, neither is its flexible support body strong enough to support its already light weight lighting point. How did this make it to amazon. Look for an alternative. Worse more, the seller is the most unresponsive I have ever known on amazon. This type of malicious sellers on amazon needed to be weeded off by amazon. What a pity!"
3,Not a good product,"I've used it 5 times max in the past 2 years..It's shaky and the light is not that efficient to illuminate all the keyboard..Cheap price, cheap product."
1,Too little light,"The light it gives is too little, I think I would need at least 3 or more of the same one to be able to light my whole keyboard.It only gives light to a couple of keys at a time.If you want to light your whole laptop keyboard don't buy this lamp."
1,It is not a light,This light is too week and still can not see the leybard. Don;t waste your time on this.
3,Ordered two lights.. Both arrived with deep cracks covering each bulb.,"I ordered 2Mini USB LED Lamp Light Flexible Travel for PC Notebook. Both arrived with numerous deep cracks covering each bulb that considerably obstructed the light. The outer packaging (consisting of a plastic cover and slide-through stiff paper backing), as well as the box the items were delivered in had no damage, indicating the lights were broken before they were shipped. The construction felt sturdy, but the bulb covers seem prone to easily cracking, which will either partially obstruct the light, and/or misdirect it. Without properly functioning lights, the items are worthless.Not factored into my review, but is worth noting: I promptly returned them and was initially refunded less than half of what I paid, after spotting the wrong amount on my bank statement, I contacted Amazon customer service, which promptly refunded the balance owed."
2,Poor design,"The light is quite bright when seen from the -side-, which makes it unsuitable for use in a dark room; you aim it at the keyboard but then there's this bright light in the corner of your eye, which is distracting and annoying.I've amended mine by wrapping a piece of electrical tape around the barrel, and that makes it usable. But it should be redesigned so that this is not necessary."
1,keyboard light,only 2 months old with minimal use and already the bulb burned out. i cannot figure out how to get to it without breaking it. i want to return it or get instructions how to replace bulb please. thank you
4,USB light,"This light does the job. Wish the head was just a little bit bigger, so that the light would cover the entire keyboard. For the price, it fit the bill."
2,Laptop Light - Don't expect much,"I have another LED light I purchased a long time ago and it is much brighter than this one and has a control switch, which allows to alternate between two brightness settings. Then again, the only reason I got this light was because it was included with the laptop pad I purchased. So, not bad for being a freebe."
1,stopped working after a couple of uses,i've gotten cheap stuff from ebay before and it's lasted me a whileJust because it's $1.41 doesn't mean that it can't work past a couple of uses
1,Do not waste your time and money,"The item only worked for one hour. After speaking to the mailer, they suggested that I try the lite in another source. I tried the lite in another source and it only worked for fifteen minutes. A full refund was given."
1,Poor Quality,The LED lamp worked upon arrival but failed after a single day of use. I was attracted by the low cost but I guess you get what you pay for.
3,What did you honestly expect for $4.50?,"It gets the job done but I wouldn't recommend this light. The LED has too sharp a beam and does not fully illuminate the keyboard area. More like a little spotlight. Would be a better product if there were a way to adjust the beam so it would diffuse somewhat. A power switch or button would be helpful too. But it does light up the keyboard as it is advertised to do. I do like the style, I think the sleek neck actually looks really nice. So I'll use this for now, will probably replace it with something that has a wider beam when I get around to it. Not that important a thing. Bottom line, it's ok, but keep looking."
1,Useless,"the light is of useless intensity... won't even light a keyboard to useable levels. Cheaply made, useless JUNK! Don't waste your money on this item."
2,easy come,Light burnt out in 30 days. I wound not buy this light again. I thought LED's last forever. I'm disappointed
4,Putting a little light on the Subject,"I occasionally use my laptop in the evening, while watching TV; there's not a light near by, so it's difficult to see the keyboard. I went cheap on the pricing, just to see if a laptop light would be a worthwhile investment. The light I received works well, is bright enough to shine on most of the keyboard, but could be a tad bit brighter. The neck is flexible, and long, enough to be moved into the most useful position. I'm quite pleased with the purchase price, and the quickness of the shipping."
3,"not fantastic, but darn well worth the money","I had hoped for something brighter, and I'll get a 4 LED next time, but for what I paid, I got a helluva bargin!"
1,junk,does not move easy and there is no on off switch you must unplug it to turn off would not buy again.
2,I don't even use it anymore.,"I got this to light up the top part of my keyboard during my night online gaming sessions. Sometimes you just need to see and make sure you press the right key. The light is too weak, and the body doesn't always hold the shape you want it in. Because it is cheap, I ordered two of them... The first one already broke from the base and the second one is still in the package unopened as I found it useless."
1,Not useful at all,"Does not light up the whole keyboard, beams on only one key at a time, it is a narrow spotlight, you have to swing the flex neck around to search for a key,like a police helicopter at night searching for a villain! Too much work."
3,Not a bad little light.,"The lamp is a small ""spotlight"" where it shines on a small area of your work area. It does the job, unless you are expecting a larger area (like a document) to be lit. It does the job in lighting a small area, but don't expect more than that."
4,2 lites; 2 sizes ??,"hey Amazon - Just ordered 2 of these lights and they arrived yesterday- To my surprise, I discovered that there are two sizes - a medium and a large; the medium is about 8 inches long and looks almost identical to the large one, which is about 12 inches long. They both put out a small amount of light, which is enough for keyboard usage or reading medium to large print. Will report back to life expectancy of LEDs."
3,Decent Quality USB Light - Dimmed Significantly in 2 Months,"This is a very good value, considering the low price. Item is actually silver color (appeared gray in the photo). The flexible neck is a little too flexible (doesn't always stay in the position intended). I plugged this into a USB connector that was built into a night light (from Wal-Mart) so that it is powered from a wall outlet (can also use the plug-to-USB connector that comes with iPod chargers). This allows me to use it as a wall-mounted low power accent light (instead of a night light).UPDATE: After about 2 months of heavy use, the LED has dimmed significantly. It's now little more than a dim accent light."
1,Broke,"When I first got the light plugged it in and it worked. I use my laptop alot in the dark, when I needed the light it did not work. So basically it worked once. Not worth the money. Nor is it worth to send it back, it would cost more to mail it then what I paid for it. I guess you get what you paid for."
1,???????????,This product worked for about 12 hours then it burned out. I guess you get what you pay for. Not very bright light either.
1,it worked for a hour,It came in the mail today it took almost a month to get to me but it came from hong kong and i live in the U.S.A so i understand I put it in my computer and it worked perfectly fine for about a hour then the light cut off i unplugged it and put it in another usb port on my computer and still nothing i even plugged my computer up because i thought the low battery was causing it not to work properly but still nothing im not sending back because it would take way too long plus i only paid $1 for it i guess u get what u pay for
2,Not so bright,"It works well but it's not as bright as other ones I've bought of amazon before. Does the job and is smaller than other ones, but if you work at night, you might need a more powerful one."
1,Buyer Beware - Do NOT buy this junk,"This light worked for about 30 seconds, then died. Tried it in 3 different pc's - nada. Contacted the seller and was refunded the $1.51 but I'm still out the $3 shipping.Even if it did work, I would not recommend this light to anyone. It is so heavy that it will strain your usb port and probably break it. If it doesn't break it, it will enlarge the port where it will not make good contact with other devices put in there later. I can't believe this seller is still selling these. I wasn't going to leave feedback at first, thinking he would pull these off the market, but he's obviously satisfied making a few cents off shipping after refunding folks the item price. Shame..."
4,Great Futuristic looking product,"This Light is great in many ways.It is flexible so it can bend around your screen if your port is on the back, or gaze over your keyboard from high and stay still.Its light is not Strong enough to make the whole keyboard shine, but it provides just enough light for the long dreaded nights you spend on your computer.It works great on my Sony Vaio Laptop, and provides the light needed.One other great thing is its power usage, as USBs drain power from your battery, this little device takes very little battery to illuminate my keyboard.Overall its something i would recommend to all my colleagues. It looks cool and futuristic, its small and flexible enough to take it anywhere, and it will save you the frustrating moments trying to find a certain key on the keyboard at night..."
4,Extremely easy to use!,This light was extremly easy to use. Just plug it into the USB and it turns right on. No on and off switch though.
4,Light it up!,"Puts out a pen point light, great if need a small light rigt on a certain area on keyboard, flood light it isn""t. Got item quickly."
5,Longtime Favorite,"As a big TYA fan while in college, ""I'm Going Home"" was our theme song just before leaving campus to head home for a break or holiday. So when this album first came out I had to buy it, more rockin' TYA blues right? I soon found out it wasn't and at first was a little taken back - but not for long. I soon came to love the album and all but destroyed my vinyl record playing it so often. Two years ago I came across the CD after all but giving up on ever having it digitally. Nearly 40 years have passed since I first heard ""On the Road to Freedom"" and I have to say it's still an all time favorite. At times it rocks. Other times it's so beautiful. And everything in between. Few albums leave the listener with so many varied emotions and pass the test of time as this one has."
4,Amazing lyrics... and some of the best songwriting,I only have this album on vinyl right nowand i will soon pick up the cd..... but its worth itamazing lyrics
2,On the road to freedom ? Yeah !,"After Woodstock and the aftershock of the performance by TYA, Alvin decided to take a break in the English countryside, put down the electric guitar and cool off the sweat, rage and excitement of his newly established stardom. So he called friends (other rock stars of the early 70's - George Harrison even wrote a song I think) and very consciously crafted a folky-acoustic-country-like album. This one will astonished anyone looking for fast Alvin Lee electric licks (if that's what you are looking for, don't get this album). If you want to share a pure moment of retreat under the wooded forest, in company of Alvin, then, go for it, you will enjoy the serenity this album will bring you. I have it, I like it, I may even bring it on a deserted island if I had to (along with Stonedhenge and SSSSH of course !)."
3,Its ok,"since i don't have a green thumb, most of the beans died but five of the beans grew more than i expected."
3,A good read,"The author presents an interest concept of his own family ""discovering"" America. The story gets a bit thin as he does not go into depth with the most important proofs, while he spends much more time creating a history of the Grail and the Templars. For the real story of Antonio and Nicolo Zeno story and the 1398 expedition there are better books to read. Sinclair somehow decided the Doge of Venice and the family Zeno should not have an ""O"" after their name. Once making this error - he sticks to it despite the fact that no one else has ever spelled it as ZEN. Leading this reader to wonder if a fact checker might have helped."
1,The Sword and the Grail by Andrew Sinclair Disappoints,"Andrew Sinclair's tedious and pompous book about the supposed discovery of America by his ancestors, the Sinclairs of the Orkney Islands, and his supposed discovery of the Holy Grail. is the closest thing to saying he has found the Lockness monster. This pseudo-scientific bunch of baloney never should have been published. God only knows why it was. If this is all Sinclair can produce these days, he should pack it in and take up checkers. Chess would be too challenging."
3,Interesting but...,"Bromell was there.So was I.But Bromell goes wild analyzing the spaces between words in Beatles or Dylan songs. While the spirit of the 60s is amenable to me and I agree that rock was an integral part of the times (and quite meaningful - quite ""lived"" as Bromell would say), it can be overdone. Nevertheless, it's an interesting read and at times Bromell's analyses of songs are more interesting than how I experienced the songs back when they were released (I think his PhD helped him look back with a keener eye than I'll ever have)."
1,Stems and seeds,"Beatle-crazed and ridiculously weak in terms of coverage of zoned superstars like the Jefferson Airplane, the Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead, this book barely scratches the surface of the topics presented in the title."
1,"Not a ""Real"" Watch",The Stuhrling watches are great for show but are unfortunately of horrible quality!Do not expect this watch to work for long! Its also a big watch!
1,Its not what you may think!,"The title is misleading this is a boring film. Its not from above, but a documentary about earth's water ways and the destruction of its Forests. Its a France Film with subtitles. If I had to read this much I'd read a book. So save you money and look elsewhere. Yes it is a great topic, but don't mislead the public."
5,Great book to teach rhyming skills,My son was really have a tough time learning this essential pre-literacy skill. This book helped nail down the concept of rhyming for him.
4,"Strong, human political/ecological documentary","Very good, if not quite great, this documentary about poor villagers being cruelly displacedby a massive dam project in India has some emotional and powerful moments.There's no pretense of objectivity here - this is a film with a point of view, and it expressesit strongly.The weak spots are a certain sense of repetition, and a back of the mind feeling that goodand bad might be a bit more complex than shown here - we're asked to take some of the film'skey assertions on face value, without question or rebuttal.None-the-less, a moving and sadly inspiring film."
5,A powerful movie,"A powerful movie that I further reviewed on my blog at [...] For anyone concerned about water scarcity or social and environmental injustices, the plight of these people takes the cake. I also recommended this for use in a graduate school class while learning about the same topic. An easy to understand video that even my daughter, who is middle school, is watching, for a project."
5,wonderful atmosphere and settings,"Aside from the fact that I now have to go buy a recording of Don Giovanni, this is a terrific book. Mozart and his librettist are under the gun to get their production going and seek advice from the then-premier womanizer in the history of the world, Casanova. After all, who better to advise on staging and dramatizing the nuances and perils of seduction? But the best aspect of the book, for me, were the atmosphere and details in the settings -- the genteel yet dramatic interplay between the characters and the dynamics that move the story forward. It's all rendered with a touching affection and respect for the characters and their times. Lovely."
5,The Enchantments of Mozart's World,"This imagined chronicle of Mozart's life in Prague leading up to the debut of Don Giovanni is a pleasure. I'm not enough of a historian to know about the accuracy of some of the book's details, but the writing is breezy and engaging, as is the story. It's a relaxing, incredibly affectionate look at Mozart's relationships with his wife, librettist Lorenzo da Ponte, and -- in an interesting twist -- Casanova, who assists both with the staging of the opera and with romantic intrigues that weave through the plot. It's also an engaging tour of the social practices and mores of the time. And it's a lot of fun. Of course, I had to go out and buy the opera afterwards, so beware of getting lured into the entire subject. My only wish is that there had been a discography to suggest great recordings."
5,Good reading.,Its an honest insight of someone's experience not only with FMS/CFS but with other conditions. The author endures many ups & downs & its a ride you wont forget.
1,I MADE MISTAKE - NO VIDEO MACHINE TO PLAY IT ON,I want to return this video as I do not have a machine to play it on anymore. I made a mistake and do not know how to return this un use unopened item. HELP ME PLEASE !!
1,Never Works,"I purchased this item a few months ago and it has yet to work right. It is only working about 10% of the time and even then it doesn't seem to like excepting files. I do not recommend purchasing this. Mine will soon be For Sale, if you'd like to try it for yourself."
4,Pink Panther Sticker book,"This book is fun for a Panther fan. It can be used in 2 ways, either removing the stickers and placing them on some object as normal, or by using the book itself which has backgrounds in it and the stickers can bere-used over and over again by setting up scenes then removing them and setting up different ones. Neat."
1,Disappointing,"This textbook is one of the poorest works I've had to deal with in college. The materal is not organized well, the topics are out of date, and the chapters are difficult to read. I agree with other reviewers that the book needed to be reworked.Although Rains may know his stuff, he fails to show he can communicate that knoweldge in a way that is both interesting and educational."
2,hard to understand,"I know this is not supposed to be easy stuff to get, but the way the book is written makes it all the harder to comprehend. I know classes where this book is required, and fear taking it. In previous courses, Rains required Carl Sagan, and other authors who had a crisp and interesting approach to the topic of the human brain and behavior. This book is too dry and uninteresting.Dr. Rains does know his stuff. He lacks the ability and warmth to communicate it in this text."
2,Better work is out there,"I reviewed this book for a class on neuropsych for next year, having seen an advanced copy. I was disappointed that the writting is so dry, the topics covered briefly, and that several mistakes appear in the text. The book serves as a complex edition, more for those with a solid background in the subject than for someone just starting out.Rains seems fixated on the images of William James and Sigmund Freud. While Freud started with a background in neurology, he soon left for other, more notorous studies. James, while well thought of as a man of science, also fell short of a scientific method in several areas.The author, while obviously well versed in the subject, seems to have no skill for communicating that knowledge. I myself, had a hard time understanding his style, which is often obtuse.For educators, there are better and more comprehensive textbooks out there on this subject."
1,"If required, buy it used","I found this book used online, and was glad I did not pay full price. The other reviews bring out the essential points I have against this book, style of presentation, poorly organized, outdated references....so I need not add to them. I doubt this book will find the audence it seeks. It will not become a standard text in neuropsycholgy as it fails at it's basic point...to teach.I do not doubt the author knows his material. But knowing a subject does not mean one is qualified or capable of presnting it to others. The text creates more problems than it solves. I would not recommend it to anyone interested in learning about this amazing subject, as far better texts exist."
1,I returned this text book!,"I actually was forced to use this book for a course and shelled out hard earned cash for it! Turns out, the teacher never even used it, and instead taught from other, more professional sources. Not until I made the mistake of highlighting the first few chapters, and falling asleep in the library on campus. I was able to return it to the bookstore and get some money back, but the book isn't being used next semseter anyway. Rarely, ok, NEVER, have I posted a note about a textbook, but this one was not helpful, and cost me too much! A word of warning for fellow students...avoid this book!"
3,Better understanding,"I bought this book as a companion to Tank Killers, which was about tank destroyer doctrine during WWII?.. Excellent ride along and the pictures and ddescriptions were great!"
4,"Minimal ""Slop"" and easy set up on my Table saw","I have a Ridgid table saw and there is some ""Slop"" in the fit of this product. I'm still trying to figure our how I can add some width to one (or two) edges of this product to get a tight but movable fit. Otherwise, very sturdy with plenty of screw holes for attaching to the top surface of the slot for a rip sled, etc."
1,Waste of money,"88 degree angle? 92 degree angle? Depends on which time you adjust this poorly made square. Bought it, tried it, and made a half dozen bad cuts..... then tossed it in the junk pile. Just too much variation depending on which time you adjust and clamp it."
5,An excellent historical novel.,"I knew the history of this novel was accurate after I'd read it. Members of the Osage tribe were known for having oil monies. During the time of this book, many of them were defrauded or killed for their wealth.My Dad grew up close to the scene of this book. After he'd read it, he said that it was quite accurate in its portrayal of what went on in those days."
5,mean-----library book,"MEAN SPIRIT--374 pages--auth/LINDA HOGAN-1990.Hogan is the Chickasaw tribe - Oklahoma - artist in residence.I have enjoyed ALL her books tremendously.It is common knowledge that the discovery of Oil in Oklahoma Indianterritory in the 1920s made many Indians rich..then a vicious campaignof fraud,intimidation and murder began against them.Belle and Moses Graycloud,Michael Horse,John Stink,Stace RedHawk-theirlives all change horribly.John Hale a rancher..now oil man..is behind ALL the M E A N!Hale uses the local sheriff,government officials,hired thugs and businessmen to get what he wants!A really GOOD...S-A-D READ.bbpokc ok63retired"
4,Mean Spirit,"Mean Spirit is a wonderful work showing the Indian's view on life and nature. The novel, based on true story, really touch me and makes me feel for the Indians. The Indian seems unlikely to win the 'confrontation' against the white government. It gives my sympathy for the white man and the U.S government for they were (are?)not ashame in annexing the land of the native people of American since the early colonialization. It just too bad that the story does not end in a happy ending on the Indian side."
3,Good overview of Taj - not for a collector...,"I got it before I went to see Taj Mahal recently at City Winery in NYC in August 2012.I was very happy to have made the purchase, as I had not listened to him in awhile and it got me re-exposed to this great man's work. It also got me really in the mood to see him.However, if you own a lot of his work, not worthwhile...in my opinion..."
5,A gem for the fans of Irving Fields,A long awaited tribute to one of the most well known works of Irving Fields. Some nice videos are included ... which adds a nice touch to this piece of memorabilia.Note that the recording appears to be protected against ripping an MP3.
4,a pleasure and a piece of history,"From Havana to Havannah Nagila. . . it's cute, it makes you want to dance, it makes you proud to be Jewish. And it's not overproduced. You can hear the performance-joy that Irving Fields brought into the recording studio."
4,Kickbit Information - 'Bitkicks' (ATM Records),"This band was a short-lived side project for Uli Trepte,original bassist for German krautrock band,Guru Guru.'Bitkicks' was recorded in 1975 and 'discovered' just a few years ago,by Uli.""Schnellbedienung"" is probably the best cut here,almost fourteen minutes of experimental cosmic madness with elements of jazz intact.""Hacksack Serenade"" makes for a good jam session,perhaps improvised.""Psychedelic Review"" is an impressive tune that goes on for nearly thirty minutes but it appears that the entire band is completely cutting loose.Better than Trepte's 'Real Time Music' effort.Should appeal to fans of Faust,Ax Genrich,Neu! and maybe SOME fans of Can."
3,Original movie cover for the Newest movie version,"I hoped to receive the Original ""Umrao Jaan"" since I've seen the newer one and heard countless viewers claim it didn't do the Original much justice. I guess I will continue looking for the Original version, but the price I paid for the DVD received was good and it plays with ease and clarity; no scratches or skips. Thanks!"
1,Bubba Sucks,"I haven't read any of the other ""Bubba"" stuff, but this collection is dreadful. The stories are uninteresting, the characters flat and boring. Frankly, I'm sorry I paid to read it."
1,Stupid,"Selina Rosen is a very, very good writer. I have read her science fiction and had a hard time putting them down. But this book is extremely bad. It's not funny. Other reviewers have made mention of the Prom Story. I found no humor and thought it was stupid in the extreme. Hopefully, Selina Rosen will stick with her science fiction titles. She does a great job with those."
4,"Make a larger one, please. 80x90""","I love this heat saver, as an extra blanket on my bed in winter. The constant use has deteriorated parts of the foil, now in it's second year. Probably paid for itself in two seasons. Actual 5 feet x 7 feet (INCORRECT: Product Dimensions: 14.5 x 1.5 x 7 inches)"
3,Not Bad,Has interesting twists I found intruiging. I like Jim Carey the Comedian but didn't think he could pull it off in a thriller. He is quite good at it. The movie itself has a lot of narration that I enjoyed and plenty of sequences to keep you glued to the screen. I recommend this movie.Tami Love
3,Bizarre,"Okay, we finished the movie...but laughed our way through it as it was justtrying to be meaningful and poignant but came across as absurd. Worth seeing but don't expect that much."
4,Intelligent and enjoyable,"First, you need to be able to let go of whatever pre-conceptiopns you have about Jim Carrey. I'm not a big fan of his other films but he does a gerat job in this serious role. The film is intelligent and clever. The whole numerology-thing was pretty cool. I disagree with people who lable this a ""horror"" film. IMO, 23 is a psychological thriller. I didn't figure out the ""suprise"" ending in advance, which is unusual for these kinds of movies.The only real gripe I have with the film is that the ending was a touch weak (but not too bad).Recommneded."
5,It Was GREAT!!!,"I thought the Number 23 was a good movie. It was a pleasant relief from his typical ""funny"" movies. Of course, I am not a very big comedy fan. Most comedies to me are not funny, but stupid.Honestly, I think the Number 23 was some of Carrey's better work."
2,Don't Do It!!!!!,"I am a huge Carrey fan, but this movie absolutely blows. The story makes no sense, and it is nothing like the previews indicate. Absolutely absurd, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I wish I could say something positive, but I can't. The movie is so dark and dreary it is actually hard to see, not just difficult to watch. Characters are introduced randomly that have seemingly nothing to do with the plot, and why Virginia Madsen is still making big screen movies I'll never know. Wasn't she the one from the original Candyman movie? I guess she made some kind of comeback in an indie film a few years ago, but she is terribly vapid in this movie. Carrey is all over the place, with the facial expressions of the Cable Guy, set on the backdrop of ""the Grudge."" I give it 2 stars for trying to be creative but even Carrey can't save this trainwreck of a film. WASTE of time and money."
4,This is how I see it,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, it caught and held my attention firmly. I just knew it was going to be one of the best movies I'd ever seen.....to say the least, at first I was a bit disappointed. It started out a bit slow for my taste, and I was prepping myself for a big disappointment. But I decided to hold on for a little longer...and I'm glad I did because I got what I wanted. I love movies that catch me off guard and leave me wondering ""what the...."". This movie did that for me. I was completely caught off guard with how it all turned out because it was a complete 360 from the ending I had in my head. And Jim Carrey did an excellent job, in my opinion.I rented this movie, but I am planning on buying it."
1,urgh!,"It pisses me off that hacks like these are allowed to steal the ideas of brilliant dead guys like William Burroughs and Robert Anton Wilson and make such tepid swill. When I saw the director's name, all was made clear. Go back to window dressing, Joel!"
3,Eh ...,"I agree with most others here because, well, we're supposed to all follow the heard. No this isn't Jim Carey's finest moment, but consider what he gets paid for his name on the marquee.The ideas of numerology being a hidden, arcane type of communicating by the Illuminati types that truely run the world is an old legend type thing, but interesting enough to be the basis for a movie with rather significant backing by the movie industry. Hmmmmm ... maybe the Hollywood types are the ones ruling the world.Very intriguing premiss that just missed the mark. Good renter if you want to see a fairly realistic vision of someone slowly sinking into paranoia."
2,Interesting plot ... in the end,"Although the overall plot turns out to be somewhat interesting, my problem with the movie was with Jim Carrey trying so hard not to be Jim Carrey. I mean, as a dogcatcher maybe, but can you buy him as a hard-boiled detective? No. It's ludicrous, despite the gritty and saturated look in those scenes. Suspension of disbelief just vanishes in those scenes.Otherwise, it's entertaining enough."
1,"23 min is enough of this garbage, really sucks.","Jim Carrey has reached an all time low, this movie was really bad, do not waste 23 dollars on this, 23 min into to it, you will feel ripped off. Do not even rent this, glad we did not buy it. Enough said, you are warned."
5,Amazing Psychological Thriller,This movie changed my life! I adore it. The twists and turns of the plot are captivating and fantastic. Jim Carrey is truly a star in this film.
4,Good,This movie is...uhhmmm...weird but yet very interesting...I would recommened this to somebody who likes down-right weird movies...I liked it though...interesting.
1,SLOW!! STUPID!! and a total waste of $4.97 at Blockbuster,"The movie started off slow and stayed on a turtle's trott throughout the movie. I was not surprised when things started happening that resembled his life, nor was I surprised when it turned out to be him that wrote the book. Come on Jim Carey, stay with what you know!"
1,Very bad,I would have given this a rating of 2 or 3 but you know. I was so excited about this movie because it is very differen't from most of his other movies. The story starts out VERY slow. You start to fall asleep right away. Then it starts showing him as the character in the book he is reading. This makes things very confusing. It keeps jumping from one character to another. Then when you find out what actually happened. (in the last 15 minutes) It makes no sense and it leaves so many dead ends and questions that you ask yourself why you watched it all. I have never wanted to leave during a movie but I wanted to leave after 15 or 20 minutes of this one. The only reason I didn't it because my mother and I went to see it and I thought she liked it. Only to find out she hated it and didn't leave because she thought I liked it. I would deffenitly rent this instead of buy it. Jim if you are reading this stay away from the guys that made this movie. Far far away.
3,Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen tried their best to save the show....,"I am always fascinated whenever Jim Carrey tries to do a serious non-comedy film and see what he's capable of in terms of showing more range. I am not disappointed by him at all, it's the script that is boring and it was kind of predictable what was happening half way into the film. It could have been a very good thriller, but there was very little horror or suspense about it. The characters are confusing and the film is so slow. It was so hard to enjoy this film. I really like Virginia Madsen and Carrey's performances, and they both get to play double characters so that's a bit more interesting to watch. The story was out of focus, there was so much on the mystery behind # 23 and then there is a twist and turn that leads to a new subplot that has nothing to do with the # 23....Oh well, it's one of those times when Carrey picks the wrong project and you just rather see him do another comedy."
2,Jim Stick with comedy,He must been high on something when he made this flim #9 #9 #9 The worst film ever. He was not a kid when this was made!!
2,Not what I expected,I was expecting a cheesy psycho-thriller. Instead I got a cheesy film noir? Jim Carey doesn't seem to take himself to seriously here which is good because it's hard to take anything seriously about this movie. Good flick to check out if you have absolutely nothing else to do on a Sunday afternoon.
1,captions,no captions... extremely dissatisfied. Ever heard of accessibility to everyone? Please subtitle your movies or atleast notify us it has no subtitles before purchase so we dont waste our money.
2,"Sounded Interesting, but Disappointed...","The two things I liked about this movie were: Jim Carrey acting rather than relying on his funnyman persona and the interesting premise.What I didn't like? Pretty much everything else. (And, okay, Carrey as a a-hole to animals when he's an animal control officer immediately made him completely unlikable for me. It was pretty much downhill from there--and that was the first scene.)Movies like this need a character to like and root for--someone. For me, as talented as the actors in it are, there was absolutely no one to like or care about. I couldn't wait for it to be over--and the ""mystery"" was a huge let-down as well.A ""fail"" on pretty much every level--plot and character. Even the structure was darkly filmed and quite choppy. Two stars just because it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was so disappointing in every respect that there's no way to boost it to ""3""."
1,"I'm sorry, but I just can't get into this movie.","I figured it would be nice to see Jim Carrey in something other than a comedy. This movie starts out fine, but quickly becomes a cluster of plot twists that are completely unbelievable. I had to turn this movie off after the first 45 minutes..."
1,"Dear Mr. Carrey, You proved with ""Truman"" and ""Man On The Moon"" you could do drama","So why oh why did you step into this messy one note ""thriller"" that makes you look foolish and shows you in such a bad light. We know you are better than this and wait for you to sink your teeth into better roles than this."
1,23 is a big zero,"Carrey and Schamcher team up in this very freekish movie that looks like a cross between X-Files, and a bad Steven King novel. There is no script, no plot, no complex characters, no one to like, and no idea where these two fools were taking the movie. In any case you loose intrest and walk out of the theater very fast."
4,Pretty darn good psychological suspense!,"THE NUMBER 23 I felt was underrated. The acting was very good. The plot was a well-crafted murder mystery. There was a lot of psychological suspense, especially with his wife, that kept you guessing. Madsen & Carrey were very good. The sexual alter-identity bits were rather ridiculous, but they didn't detract too much from the overall quality of the film."
2,A slow start to a boring film...(How bizarre! The letters to the title of my review add up to 23!!),"Unfortunately once again the modern era of complicated movies with twisted endings delivers another disappointing film. I was really geared up for this one when I saw the trailer but this film nearly lost me at the 45 minute mark. I'm glad in a way I decided to stick it out to the end because the film does get a little more interesting from the half way mark to the end, but it's a shame we have to sit through the first 45 minutes to get there. Of course this film does appeal to a certain genre of people out there who do have a fascination with the number 23, Jim Carrey being one of them in real life from when he was a younger man. I think it's only those people who will really benefit from this film."
2,If you liked The Machinist...,"If you liked The Machinist you might like this. Or should I say if you liked this you'll definitely like The Machinist. Both films are of a similar theme and genre, only The Machinist - in my opinion - was a much better film, mainly because it had a lot more happening and more to keep the mind occupied and intrigued. This film I mainly just sleepwalked through."
2,A HOT MESS,Here lately it's been hard to find a good movie. That'll hold my interest and i'm truly addicted to dvds. The last movie that had me going through all kinds of emotions was titanic. I made a mistake and got 23 (lawd) This movie put me to sleep and i thought. The only good thing that came out of this film. Was a very good paycheck to the cast. This movie is horrible. I'm going for an exchange today.Luther Aramis McRae
4,JIM IS SERIOUS!!,"i didn't know what to expect when i bought this, but truthfully i was blown away by the ending. didn't see it coming at all. drags a little at first, it goes back and forth, then you just start guessing and then bam! this man gets this book for his birthday and it revolves around around the number 23. he says the book is about him and his life, he becomes obsessed and is afraid this is taking over his life. he doesn't know who wrote it or why, but he's determined to find out. little by little, his recollection returns, and some things are better left buried. it's suprising and very good. Jim Carrey great actor a good film i do suggest you watch it."
2,Weak...,"Jim Carrey is a great actor and it disappoints me that he would stoop to this movie.The overall idea is kind of interesting and fun to play with, but the execution of the writing, acting, and directing was just sort of pathetic. The story stretches out well, only to be very rushed at the end (and the ending was sort of weak overall). Throughout the movie, the main character is reading a book and they play out parts of the book while he is reading it, now these fictional flashbacks are just cheezy. The only good part about them is that Rhona Mitra (Who is amazingly good looking) is in them, but that does not salvage horrible film making."
3,Mixed emotions,"For me, watching this movie was a mixed bag of emotions. The beginning is tediously slow and strange. I could not get a clear picture of who was who and what was actually happening. On several occasions I was just seconds away from giving up and switching off the DVD-player. I kept watching, though, and gradually got hooked by the story and by Carrey. In spite of the difficult start, at the end of the movie the overriding emotion was still that I had watched a really good and interesting movie. I thought James Carrey's acting --in a serious role for once-- was more than OK too. Intriguing storyline, albeit still a bit strange. Definitely not your average, run-of-the-mill movie."
2,Slow -- Couldn't Finish Watching,"The plot sounded interesting, but the movie is so slow I gave up and didn't finish watching."
4,Good,I think.. that this movie is definitely worth watching. Good gripping suspense and ends with a fantastic explanation. Its not just about the number as you will realize. Jim Carrey again proves his caliber.
2,Numbers are after us? Someone needs a life!,"As you can gather from the title after getting a book as a present the number 23 appears over and over in this guys life. You see numbers like 599 on signs through out the movie. 5+9+9 You get the idea. They tell you lots of cool facts about 23 too. Ronald Wilson Reagan has 6 letters in each name = 666 divide that number by 28.95652 and you get 23. OK thats not in the movie but isn't it freaky? the number 2 is the smallest even number, 3 is the smallest odd other than 1. Just think of how many numbers can be worked down to 2 or 3 or both.I am sorry I bought it. I am sorry I wasted two hours of my life watching it. This guy is freaked about the number 23 following him around? I'll introduce him to a letter that has been haunting me for years. My X is much worse than his 23.The only freaky thing about the number 23 is that the rating for it was 2.3 when I wrote this review."
4,Creative movie for people with creative minds,The Number 23 turned out to be a very creative movie in my viewpoint because I wasn't sure if the lead actor could do movies besides comedy until I saw him do this movie was impressed with his preformance. The movie ended up keeping my intrest all the way threw to the very last scene which doesn't happen that often. But I would tell people to see this movie least once in their lifetime because will open up your mind to new possiblities and other stuff. Plus buying the unrated edition you get more for your money. So if your looking for a movie that will keep your intrest all the way threw as long as you keep your mind open and willing to give the actor a chance to show you he can do more then comedy movies then this movie will do you good and watch it with your friends or a night were you got night to yourself.
3,america's critic,this one was a lil different im not sure but i think this was based off a comic-- with strange turns and the ending this movie was just ok jim carrey being serious---in my life its be good at what ur great at!! and its not this fire marshal bill
2,Not for Rhona Fans,"I only bought this movie because I'm a Rhona Mitra fan. That said, she doesn't show up until the final 10 minutes of the film. If you're a fan of hers rather than Jim Carey, skip this film and get Sparticus instead, because she actually co-stars throughout the 3-hour film."
1,My son just apologized for wasting two hours of my life.,"I am a Jim Carrey fan, as well as a huge thriller/horror fan, but the two just didn't work together in this film.I thought a few times that it wasn't sure what it was supposed to be: sex thriller, detective noir(ish, psychological thriller, etc...It had it all but I never bought into any of it.And my kid was wrong, it wasn't a total waste of my two hours. I did kinda laugh when I saw that tribal tattoo."
4,nice,It is a thrilling movie staring Jim Carry and his odd twisted obsession with the number 23. Finding it in everything in life he drives himself to insanity only to fine the truth about the number.
1,Number 23 - Have not received,"Order 105-4049277-4150607 - The movie Number 23I have not received this movie as of yet - 3/11. I contacted the seller Kelly Dugally at kellie@norampartners.com on 2/24/9 and she assured me the movie shipped on 2/9 and ""could take up to 21 business days or longer to arrive"". I'm not sure how much LONGER she wants me to wait. I ordered three movies that day and the other two movies arrived the week of 2/9/09.I am very disappointed and plan on reviewing the seller/shipper in the future to make sure what I am ordering is NOT from NorAm International Partners, INC.Above I was made to RATE THIS ITEM and it would not let me leave it blank. I had to mark one star to complete this review. That is upsetting since I would rate this transaction a zero!RhioFernley, NV"
2,Confusing,I watched this movie on HBO and I thought it was very confusing and hard to follow. I still dont really understand it.
2,Too many coincidences,"Initially I was intrigued with this movie. Carrey's performance closely resembled Jim Barish in Eternal Sunshine. The same confused look-running aimlessly as if the missing pieces of the script could be found on a street corner or something. But what is fundamentally remarkable is the odds of this little self publish book making it back to its writer is so incredibly laughable, I can't believe no one in the entire production of this thought-hey maybe we should come up with a better plausible ending. Again, this film uses that much hated dark nuclear green lighting that gives the impression this movie was shot in a cesspool. It's a bad script, uncreative direction and horrible lighting. Pass this one by if you can."
4,"Amusing, true stories","This little book is a very entertaining collection of short portraits of eccentric characters (both historical and more recent) from all corners and regions of Texas. Each one of the profiled people, Mr. Tolbert, over the years, either personally interviewed, or historically researched, as part of his daily columns in the Dallas News. The subjects range from very distinguished people, to semi-literate but hard-working backwoods characters, and everything in between. Mr. Tolbert draws attention to some overlooked but fascinating Texas people and incidents who have been neglected and under-appreciated. I learned some things about Texas pioneer history and culture from this book."
3,IDIOTS CAN HARDLY IDLE,"IDIOTS DE LUXE (1945) - An interesting short, and pretty good. Moe gives in a hilarious performance as a nervous wreck. ""Oh, my nerves! My nerves!""I CAN HARDLY WAIT (1943) - Another interesting short, since most of it's in dream form, and the whole short revolves around one simple little problem, but it's a hilarious short regardless, and the Stooges get to perform many gags. Also, note that the entire first half has no supporting cast.IDLE ROOMERS (1944) - An okay film, although not some of the Stooges' and director Del Lord's best work. Note that this is the very first time that supporting cast member Christine McIntyre appears in a Three Stooges short."
2,Overview,"This book is a good overview of fitting adjustments for the beginner who is just learning to adjust patterns, but by no means thorough or exhaustive. Not worth buying in my opinion, if it's in the library go and check it out. You won't need this book in your library for long if at all."
1,Waiting forever,"I really would love to review this product but have been waiting for 3 months and it still hasn't been shipped.Home decorators customer service just lies about it every time I call and enquire, I would thing twice about ordering from this company."
4,Could not put this down,"Yet another great story by Cook - this one not as dark as previous works. I liked the way each chapter is from one of the characters point of view - it gives the reader different perspectives of the same scene. Very, very fast read - a change from past Thomas Cook novels. Only minor problems are characters: one is WAY over-the-top (the bad guy), while another is under-developed (the heroine). Otherwise, a terrific book for a short weekend."
1,I think I'm Blind.....,"Other than the fact this movie was horrible I simply see things really odd in the world, I will never look at piercings the same nor a simple glass of pop.....I seem to see everything in a twisted black and white eclipse, I beleive this is the worst movie I have ever seen.....Horible storyline aka Plot, the thing I hated worst was those two girls....I wanted to strangle them both what exactly was the main thing in this movie either I missed it or there really isn't one, So the director or writer couldn't even think of something a tiny....Little bit better? huh? I mean look at this movie, I mean it does happen in real time drama but the things in between makes as much since as why someone made a no taste candy...and all they say in this movie is the F word.....blah blah NO blah #@&*$ blah blah Ick!!!!#&@(#@^ ahhhhhhhhh this movie has made me a different person and I swear it is not me."
1,Sad,First of all this movie has no script or talent. It just shows what MTV does to young girls. Very sad.
3,A Sad And Almost Never Happy Movie.,"This movie was a sad one to say the least. To put yourself in the main character shoe's would take a lot. The DVD is loaded with bonus features. I don't want to give anything away, so for how much this DVD is, pick it up for your collection. You will be happy with the purchase. 3/5 Stars."
4,Overall an Excellent Movie!,"First off I would like to say that I bought this movie BEFORE actually seeing it myself. I was just crossing my fingers hoping that it wouldn't be completely ridiculous. Much to my suprise, the movie is extremely moving and a perfect example of how a life can go so horribly wrong. Some of the scenarios I though were a little far fetched. Such as a scene where the thegirls drop acid. I thought that was a little ""hardcore"" for a couple of 13 year olds. But other than that, I recommend this movie for all!"
1,Hollywood teenage mutant girly trash.,"A decent movie if u want to get to know what average teenage american girls can get into according to Hollywood. Decent acting from all the characters esp Tracie's mum. I believe this movie to be unrealistic and overdramatic in most parts esp the end when Evie turns on Tracy and makes out that she was the bad influence on her. If u r an adult, u would get bored half way trough this film like I did because the point that Tracy's life was spiralling out of control was over emphasized. It was supposed to shock but it doesn't because u have probably seen something similar before. It is believable in most parts, pathetic and unrealistic trash in others but very watchable if u have the time. Rent it before u buy it(if u want to)."
3,Crazy Teenage Girls!!!,"I remember watching this a long time ago. Before I watched it, I was having a headache. By the time I finished it, my headache was worse because these girls were always fighting, yelling at their parents, smoking, getting high, having sex, stealing, and etc. Tracy starts out normal, then the most popular girl in school turns her into one of those bitches you see on Maury or Jerry Springer. If you want to see high-school girls doing everything real high-school girls do, then I guess you'll like THIRTEEN!!!"
2,Blah.....,"While Thirteen is in no way a bad film, it does not by any means deserve the continous praise that fellow reviewers are giving it. While it tackles a rough and very real subject, there are ultimately only 2 reasons to watch this film: Wood's and Oscar Nominee Hunter's performances. Hunter is utterly heartbreaking in her performance, and although she does not deserve to win the Oscar for THIS movie,( that honor should go to Patricia Clarkson)she definitely deserved the recognition. Overall a hit and miss forgettable film, by no means a classic or a 'great' drama."
5,Powerful...but can kids see it?,"This is a powerful exposition of peer-pressure and teen angst. Director Catherine Hardwicke has presented a devastating and totally honest display of contemporary ideas, with the help of fellow screen-writer and star, Nikki Reed (13 at the time).Nikki plays the bad-influence, while Evan Rachel Wood gives the performance of a lifetime, as the victimized ""outcast"". Holly Hunter is there, as the mother who wants to let her kid grow by herself, until it's so out of control that she needs to intervene. It's a pure, 100% performance, with total conviction. It's uncomfortable to watch, but it pulls no punches. Good DVD with extras."
5,WOW,"What an incredible movie. I didn't even know what it was about when I picked it up at the video store. I was shocked to find out that the movie was brave enough to explore its important topics. I think it was an eye opener to a lot of parents who are totally blind or even those that think they know whats going on in their teens life (I know mine dont...).Definitly check out this movie.If you are suffering with depression/drug abuse/self injury,etc I would suggest watching the movie alone."
4,How it REALLY is.,"I thought this movie was disturbing, but only because of how real it was to me. What happened with the drug use and going into a downward spiral just to fit in is exactly what happens with teenagers today. This movie is pretty incredible. It kept me interested the entire time."
2,depressing as hell,"I seriously think this was full of realistic and gut wrenching performances, no doubt but it just bored me and I got depressed. Holly Hunter and Evan Rachel Wood are excellent, especially Hunter as the mother who has to deal with her daughters transformation. Also starring a laid back Jeremy Sisto, D.W. Moffett, Nikki Reed, Kip Pardue and Deborah Kara Unger. This echoes into the realm of Larry Clark's masterpiece KIDS, but it gets lost in my mind. It has some pretty hard to chew in your face moments."
4,powerful performances!!,"I wasn't freaked out that much in the movie but there were terrific, powerful performances!! Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter's performaces together made me feel the tension between them and they were total worthy Oscar performances too! They gave tears to my eyes they were soo good! Also, Nikki Reed did a fantastic job as the bad, popular girl. The way the movie was filmed was really cool how it was hand-held because it felt realistic and that you were there watching it all. Other than movies with teens who lead the ""perfect"" life with no bad things happening to them, this movie brings out ""reality"" to teens lives. Highly recommended!"
5,REALY real.,My freind told me to let my 13 year old daughter and son to see this. Well I seriously felt like this movie was real. I had to remind my self its just a movie. i recomend all of you parents to let your teens see this. It is one of the BEST movies of the year. It seriuosly can happen to any one. And it all can begin with one comment about your socks. I hope your children get as much out of this movie as I did and my children did.
4,Who's to blame?,"See angelic, thoughtful young Tracy trying to fit in with the cool kids. See Tracy shoplift. See Tracy change her style from sweet to suggestive. See Tracy drink and do drugs. See Tracy have sex. See Tracy terrorize her mother. See Tracy cut herself. See Tracy flunk out of school. See Tracy's whole life start to unravel.And, after seeing all this, you ponder: who, or what, is to blame for Tracy's downward spiral? Is it her seductive, dangerous new best friend? Her natural adolescent impulse to form her own identity? A desire for acceptance and popularity? Her permissive, recovering-alcoholic mother or her self-absorbed father? Or is the whole of society to blame ... a society that produces self-loathing in little girls and encourages them to become sexual commodities as soon as possible?This film gives no easy answers. But it sure does expose the viewer to a disturbing and very real array of problems and questions."
3,Over the top and relentless,"I'm sure ""thirteen"" has a message in there somewhere, but it is relentless and bleak. Not only that, but the main character exhibits every cliched teenager angst symptom imagined by pyschotherapists. Each one of these problems is harrowing enough-but in one individual?? This is an afterschool special gone to hell.The acting is superb though-though the main character becomes almost unsaveable cinematically."
1,Roman Polanski's Favorite Movie!,"I'm sure the Polish gnome enjoyed this piece of garbage, but as for me, if one of these brats was my daughter, I'd turn her out in the snow!"
2,What a load......,"I thought this movie was powerful?...Not [...]Ok I'll make it short and sweet for you1.The girls do not even look thirteen and if they acctually did get 13 year old girls it would have bin a bit better2.The movie was something I've seen on an educational video which is sadly...better.3.What the hell was up with the mom?..I agree with the reviewer who was talking about the mom.4.The movie just wasn't that great especially how much great reviews I heard about it .....99% prolly says A die hard movie fan who loved this will probably say something negative about my opinion...but hey it's my opinion....The movie wasn't all that great and pretty much just had the ""shock"" value...This is something I've seen on television so this is no different....Save your self and just Rent the damn film...Nuff said"
2,Depressing,I bought this movie for my sister and it is so sad. It is about teenagers hence the title and they shop lift and cut themselves and it is just sad at what some people do. I guess if you have gone through some of that stuff and have overcome that then I think it is a great movie for you. If you get sad easily by other peoples pain then stay away from this one. It is so sad and it makes me sad that people go through this stuff. I gave it three stars because it was original and came from the heart.
1,No Stars,"If there was an option for no stars I would use it. Of all the idiotic movies available, why would anyone back a movie based purely on the views of a teenager and think it's a good movie. I agree with the one review that said it was just plain stupid and if you strive to be popular over your grades, you deserve to be beat the crap out of, drugged up so you can't remember how to spell photographer. This movie is just an invitation for kids to behave that badly. Peer pressure is just a copout for not wanting to be brave enough to be yourself. IMHO."
1,worst movie ever made...,"even if this scenario were to happen, which i do believe it could, it certainly wouldnt happen over a two week period. the movie is poorly made, the characters are badly developed, and the plot is, well how should i say this...[...]"
1,Thirteen-not for impressionable youth,"Depending where you live your kid might be able to relate. Either way before you purchace this movie do a thorough search on it first. If your kid is impressionable you might not want them emulating these characters. Although, this movie might enlighten parents as to what their kids might be doing and the pressures that your kids might be facing."
2,Lacks realism - a very average movie,"I would imagine that are very few thirteen year olds in America could relate to doing and selling hard drugs, slashing their wrists, having sex, shoplifting, and drinking in downtown until dawn.The two stars (Reed and Wood) are supposed to be 13 year old girls in grade 7. When in reality they look and act like immature 19 year olds headed for prison.The movie attempts to portray American teenage girls in such a desolate and corrupt position and does so effectively. Woods' acting and emotion is well done but the movie remains unbelievable and too fake to be taken seriously."
2,not worth your time,i saw this movie and i did not like it. the camera made me mad. you can tell this movie was written by a teenager.
2,minus 10,"After all the rave reviews I was expecting a lot more than this modern-day update of ""Foxes"" souped up with a lot of au courant teen deviance like self-mutilation, lesbianism and huffing. If the lurid misadventures of the two central characters (a pair of 13-year-old girls) is unbelievable, the casting is worse. Although both girls are supposed to be in junior high, they're portrayed by two actresses who look like hardened teenage hookers who've been plying their trade for years. A real disappointment."
5,I watched it twice!,Hard to believe thirteen year old girls have to go through this at school. But I definately believe it! I am 22 and I know that kids are learning things younger and younger...Good acting; I was very suprised by this. Good plot. Great movie. I thought it was going to be another B movie.
2,maybe i expected too much.,"to keep it simple.. i expected way too much out of this movie. friends had called it 'shocking' and 'amazing', but too me it was so tame, and hardly believable. maybe it's because when you see it after certain movies, and compare it to brilliant films dealing with drugs, such as 'Reqium for a Dream"".. nothing is able to shock you anymore. (i think those who have seen Requiem and have seen this afterwards will agree). i know this is reed's true story, but i think she has made a little over the top. the only part of the movie i would watch repeatadly was when they are running around in the sprinklers. brilliantly shot, and the music is mesmirizing. unfortunetely, that is about the only brilliant and mesmerizing part of this movie. if you want to see a good movie dealing with drugs and teens.. see 'kids', 'bully' and 'requiem for a dream'. all three are amazing."
4,Don't expect to be shocked,"""Thirteen"" may have shocked some, but young adolescent girls have been acting like this for a long time. This movie was nothing like ""Kids."" I don't feel that the filmmaker set out to ""shock"" the audience. It seemed very real. In junior high girls often feel the pressure to fit in and be popular and that often leads them to hanging with the wrong crowd. Basically, that is what this movie is about, the girl who at the beginning seems to be at the extreme good girl end of the specturm starts hanging out with Evie and goes to the extreme bad side. This film was lacking in a few areas. For one, the main character during her transition to the dark side showed very little hesitation to trying new things, things just came a bit to easy for me to find it believable at times. I was waiting for the shocking part of the film, but to me it was just a coming of age story."
3,decent i guess,i sorta enjoyed this one and sorta not was a bit slow and boring at times but overall a decent movie
3,Friend made me watch this,"If your looking for a good movie to watch, don't watch this movie. The only thing I learned from this movie was that drugs are bad, um k."
3,A real look at family struggles to raise a teenager,"Ok DvD, Reality sets in for the whole family...a drepessing movie. I thought it was going to be a fun look at the life of a teenager, but reality hit home and it showed how much struggle life is!"
3,As good as everyone thinks?,"Thirteen is by no means an acurate description of growing up. AT ALL. I, a teen, thought this movie was blown way out of proportion. Sure there is sex and drugs...but not like this. I have never heard of anybody huffing and then punching thier friends in the face for pleasure. The girl who wrote this movie must have been on crack. This movie should be a comedy not a drama....my friends and I laughed the whole way through this story of teen angst. If anything...this movie made me want to go out and do drugs so i wouldnt have to think about the stupid movie for the rest of the day because i do infact think that this movie may have made me stupider than i already was."
2,Hard to review...,"Many parents probably don't trust their kids and think they are like this. Let me tell you, no thirteen year olds do this. None. There may be a few, but they probably don't have parents.The problem is, this movie tries to be over the top. First, 13 year olds don't look like they are in their late teens. I mean cmon, no thirteen year old looks like that. Then there is the whole prostitution/drug thing. If there are kids like that, it's a result of terrible parenting. But the fact is, I don't know anyone who has so many problems at age thirteen. I mean cmon, who goes into prostitution at age thirteen?Many people are naive and say stuff like, ""This movie truly showed me the light!"" Wrong, don't believe it. It tries to be over the top and stereotypical that teens are rebellious and do all this crap. The fact is, this movie is far from the truth, and many can't see that."
2,meh...,"At the beginning, I thought this movie progressed really well. It showed how a girl struggling with family problems and trying to fit in would do anything to feel accepted by her peers.Towards the middle of the movie, it started to seem like this movie was pandering to guys who would rather see 13 year olds having sex than actually sitting down and watching a movie that had some actual substance.Towards the end, the movie got a little too artsy. The fight with her mother was long and drawn out, especially the crying. The end was all summed up by various time-elapsed shots of the girl and her mother sleeping in bed together, and culminating in her spinning around on the merry-go-round, looking at the sun, and giving out a loud scream.All in all, a very disappointing movie. Do yourself a favor and rent this one before you decide to buy it."
4,A tough year,"A bright 13-year-old ""good girl,"" Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), is drawn into the orbit of the ""bad girl"" Evie (Nikki Reed) and begins a self-destructive downward spiral. The film is very good at chronicling the boys, the drugs and the stealing, but I felt that it was a bit slim in showing what motivated Tracy to star down that path. I realize that fitting in and being popular is of vital importance at that age, but I wanted to the movie to make me really feel that need rather than rely on my own memories of it. Holly Hunter turns in a powerful, raw performance as Tracy's mother--I really appreciated her story more than that of the girls. Nikki Reed also co-wrote the script when she was thirteen herself."
1,Catalog of ills of teenagedom,"This movie is not worth watching. It feels very long, has no real point, and pretends to portray the experience of every teenager while failing miserably."
4,Nothing Shocking,"For all the hype surrounding this movie, I was bracing myself for something really controversial. I suppose that for some adults who have completely forgotten their teenage years that this film is horrifying and shocking. For me, the movie was a reminder of what it means to grow up in a crappy environment. I didn't come from a broken home, but I had friends who were just like Evie - manipulative, easy, and very troubled. Luckily I never got sucked into their depraved world, but I knew the drugs, sex, etc. were out there.I actually found myself laughing in some spots, like when the girls are punching each other because they are high and can't feel anything. To me, the film depicts the stupidity of youth, and feels very true to life. Nikki Reed and Catherine Hardwicke should be commended for their screenplay. But I wouldn't take this as being an afterschool special. This film shows how making stupid decisions can affect your whole life."
3,something just isnt right,first off i want to say i thought this movie was pritty good but there was just something about it that dousnt seem right to me it could be that a girl that hot wouldnt have a proboblom not being popular or it could be the girls look like 15 or 16 year old but there sopost to be in 7th grade but i think its cause the girl douse all the drugs and things just so she can be freinds with the poplular people and the camera have been better too but if u like movies about people who are cut themselves and do a bunch of drugs and are almost suicidal youl'll probobly like this movie if your not into that stuff or not emo you'll probobly have the same view as me or just hate the movie all together
2,Completely Overwhelming,This movie shocked me to the core. I didn't know weather to be angry or horrified. The girls portrayed in the movie knew more about the world than most 50 year old adults I know. But I guess all in all it was a movie and not all thirteen year olds are like that. (At least I hope they aren't) Another thing I couldnt figure out if this was based on a true story or fictional. I was left in a state of duh for the rest of my evening.
1,This movie robbed me of precious hours,"How this ever got funded, I will never know. THe storyline has more holes than something with a lot of holes, like that kind of cheese that is full of holes. The characters are more like schizophrenic manic depressives than developed roles. I distinctly remember one scene where the main character is amazingly mad, and the day later she's repented and dressing normally, without explanation. The conclusion, or lack of, is utterly anticlimactic. The only reason I've even taken the time to write this is so that others won't make the same mistake, and lose a valuable or or two of their lives. I can never reclaim those hours, so im sacrficing another 5 minutes of my life to preserve countless others. P.S. IF you directed or produced this movie, I have a great script about a catfish, and a suicidal broomstick, I swear its good buy it off me."
2,Awful....,"I do not understand how anyone could rate this trite piece of garbage 5 stars. The story was predictable, and the script was boring and forced. The movie had some scenes with shock value, but I didn't watch it to see fourteen year old girls getting undressed, and forcing themselves upon people. I was hoping it would be along the lines of kids, but nowhere near the intensity of that movie. The characters in this movie are two dimensional, which makes the movie even more unbeleivable. Maybe I'm being harsh, but I expected a LOT better from the other reviews I read."
1,unrealistic,"I watched this movie last year when I was 17 and I thought it came off as really contrived and overly dramatic. It surprises me a lot to hear people talk about how ""startlingly real"" it is. Everyone I know who's seen it found it laughable. She pretty much transforms into a bad girl overnight. The most inexplicable part is when she cuts herself, she doesn't seem to actually be depressed or have any reason it just seemed (as with the whole movie) like they were trying to capitalize on all of the possible bad things that a teenager could do and so decided to throw them all in one after another really unconvincingly."
2,"Same Movie , Different Decade","Everyone in this film is painfully hip and beautiful. Even the parents. Why is that? Why don't they make a drug film involving unnattractive people? Everyone in this film looks like they stepped out of a rock video. This is tried to be explained by making the mother in the film a beautician.This film has been done time after time. In black and white it was ""The Days Of Wine and Roses"" and ""Heroin Fiends"". In the eighties it was ""Less Than Zero"". The plot never changes. The only changes are the clothes, hair and soundtrack.I am sorry there is nothing new in this film, nothing to shock, nothing to suprise. When the daughter breaks down in the kitchen towards the end of the film, she is suppose to be hysterically crying, look close there are no tears!Holly Hunter stars as the mother and as usual gives the only worthy performance, typical of the films she appears in."
5,The BEST movie that has ever been made,When I first watched this movie it touched me in so many ways. It was so real and horrifying. To think that this happens to teens all around the world! I am glad finally someone made a movie like this one. It's about time for people to see what's going on in this world. This is a great movie and I highly reccomend it.
3,13 and acting it,"Nothing you haven't seen before, if you're over 13. Good acting and interesting writing considering the age of the co-authors."
3,How Your Daughter Can Plummet The Depths Of Sluthood,"Essentially, this movie details the journey of a teenage girl as she descends into a life of drug usage and sluthood. It is a commentary on how America's young girls are being transformed into willing whores.It has been a while since I've seen the movie, but its basic structure has been retained in my mind.At the beginning of the movie, she is a normal, well-adjusted high school student. Very quickly, she falls into the wrong crowd and becomes all ghetto. The remainder of the movie shows with her wallowing in the aforementioned drug usage and promiscuity.The movie is intended to shock and is successful in doing so. The maker of the movie shouldn't be attributed undue talent, though, since it is fairly predictable and contains no inspired twists or insights. Nevertheless, it is good in sounding the alarm on the problems facing today's youths (especially girls).I give the movie 3 stars."
5,Great movie!!,This is one of my favorite movies EVER... and that is quite a compliment. It really gives a great look into what life is like for 13 year olds growing up in the world today. Not much else needs to be said... the other reviews say it all. I highly recommend this movie.
3,WOW,"I bought this movie without ever seeing it and I was hoping the whole way home that it was worth the money and to my surprise it was pretty darn good!But I do have to be honest about a few things in this movie,I wasn't completely in shock of what was happening throughout the movie because around the time I had purchased this movie I was maybe 16 or 17 and I knew girls who were exactly like that and a few of them were friends of mine so I kind of knew what was going to happen next throughout the movie.It was a good movie and I have watched it a few more times since then.It is a bit raw and crazy at times because I was just never like that as a teen(at least not that far gone)so when the movie ended I was like WOW!!That was crazy.Good movie I still watch it till this day(5 years later).Buy This!!!"
2,Overrated.,"Thirteen plays like an after school special with nudity. The performances were stereotyped and the ending was a cop-out.The best part of the movie was Liz Phair's ""Explain it to Me"" playing over the end credits."
4,The real thing,"American Beauty meets Kids meets Traffic. About a ""good girl"" turned ""bad girl"", when she enters the world of drugs, casual sex, self-mutilation, etc. at age thirteen. Unlike most teen tragedy sop stories, it manages to steer clear of clichés and pop-psychology quick fixes. There's no good guy, no bad guy, no moral of the story.What I liked about this movie was that it was so raw and unrefined (it was co-written by a thirteen-year-old based on her experiences), which in turn made it so chillling.A must for all parents, or parents-to-be."
5,WOW!,Holly Hunter and the girls are amazing in this. Great movie to show in Psych Adolescent Development course in college.
3,ADULT TEASE?,"THIRTEEN is either a serious expose' of contemporary urban adolescence -- specifically early female teen culture -- or a contrived, adult tease to put first-time director Catherine Hardwicke on the map. Evan Rachel Wood is the good girl going bad under the influence of popular Nikki Reed, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Hardwicke.There's a faux realism to the scenes with teens on their own, and the acting and directing are fine, but I wanted to scream at single mom Holly Hunter to take control of her kid's life. This film does not go nearly far enough to make its point about the power of peer pressure and the corrupting domination of pop culture on kids."
5,Amazing Movie,This movie is an all time favorite of mine.It is so well written and so well acted.I would but this movie over and over again...
1,People review this and think it's realistic?,"My Review: Little miss perfect teenage girl meets the popular bad girl and gets into bad stuff and mom is shocked when she finds out. The end.Well, for me it ended about 45 minutes after the movie started. I could only last that long. It was terrible, dull, boring and predictable. Defintely a waste of time.If you want reality to show your little teenagers, show them Trainspotting."
1,Keep all daughters under lock & key.,"This movie is so far over the top and so separated from reality I can already tell you want other typical movie watching idiots will say about it:""Every human on the planet must see this movie.... Its such an important film for our generation of young woman.""Give me a break. I can find more realistic meaning in watching Terminator. Don't waste your time with this one.I hate when they make movies that are supposed to reflect our culture and yet come as close to realism as I do when I am tripping on acid."
1,thrirteen? more like 1 star,"this movie might as well be the NBC movie of the week, corny storyline and nowhere as nearly controversial as some people made it out to be. iv'e seen more drama from the jerry springer show. (which ain't saying much) if you want to see a more gripping teen flick, rent larry clark's KIDS instead of this turd."
2,"Unbelievable S***,I meen Unbelievable","Most People out there knows this is Fake.Especially me,i watched this S*** on HBO And Cinamax and On Demand.So I Had Enough Time to Research this movie.Heres 3 Reasons why this movie is fake1 They Are Way Taller and Bigger than Avreage 13 year olds2 They do all this s*** that you know A F****n 13 year old wouldn't.(When I Was 13,I didn't even know what the slang Coke stood for,Plus you wouldn't expect this from Orange County.3 Everybodys Acting Like An Airhead,My Mom Would be on My Ass everywhere I went,not just some call saying im going to the Library."
5,The Book???,This isn't exactly a review. This is a question. My question is: Does this movie have a book to go along with it? If it does then can you email me the title and author to this screenname Kissmekate312@aol.com and on the email put the title book name so I know it is that email and not a virus. Please and Thank you very much.
1,Too bad zero stars isn't an option,"Am I the only one who thinks this movie was boring? Why was it billed as being so ""important""? They use that term for any movie that stinks to try to get an audience.You'll read reviews that state how this movie portrays the real life of today's 13-year old but it actually PROMOTES this bad life... it doesn't just show it.The characters do not really redeem themselves, they just all kind of forgive each other for hurting each other over and over and nothing is resolved very well. The film just runs off the end of the reel and it's over.If you want to see kids engaged in physical love, here's your chance. Hollywood just loves to show kids do stuff they shouldn't. Hollywood is addicted to this and they want to make it look normal so more kids will do it so Hollywood will have the chance to get more kids in the Directors' lairs."
1,GARBAGE!!!,"This movie is the most cliched pile of garbage I have ever seen! I also found it kind of racist, notice how everytime she snuck out to do something bad it was with black people? Sickening.This movie felt like a crappy MTV video. How could anyone say this is a masterpeice? Gosh."
3,Okay...,"The only thing i can really say about this movie was it was only decent. It wasn't hard hitting or ""scary"" like other people said. Having a past in using drugs the film just didn't hit it for me. I don't see why this movie scares so many people. The main character was only using ""soft"" drugs, she wasn't a herion addict or anything. She wasn't in the movie having withdrawls, and she wasn't addicted to anything. She only did drugs occasionaly, and the only real sad part about the movie is that the relationship with her and her mom wasn't hurt. This movie truly was lame."
1,Tacky,"I heard about this movie and being an inner-city teen myself (19, working my way out of teen years I guess but whatever) wanted to see what all of the hype was about. It bored me to tears. I mean a lot of it was just obnoxious and silly. This is NOT true to life, Ive never met a thirteen year old like this in my entire life. Sure, I guess its possible, but these girls would have been a thousand times more believable as 15 or 16. Its very stereotypical, the ""I have a bad mom and I don't fit in so I cut myself and destroy my life to fit in, feel bad for me"" type of movie. Just a silly teen angst film, the sort of thing kids write in their diaries about and fantasize about but never do. I cant stand that sort of thing and it makes me sad that parents are watching this and freaking out because honestly it is so ridiculously exaggerated. Just dont waste your time."
4,almost great,"I recommend a double feature, Almost Famous for the lighter side of teenage promisquity and drug abuse and Thirteen for the reality. Thirty years apart in time yet so little has really changed.I know we've come a long way. We're changing day to day. But tell me, where do the children play? Cat Stevens, 1970Though Thirteen is not easy to watch I watched it twice just to catch its several Biblical allusions."
4,Best Movie for Teenagers,I really like this movie because it really gives a message to all the teenagers that see it. They can see in this movie that little problems like trying to fit in a clique in can turn into a big problem.
3,Mediocre,"The girls in this movie scare me, especially the scary way they look and act. This is both the good and the bad part. It is the story of a girl that is doing well at school but because of a bad family situation (her mom is a recovering alcoholic) has to break out. She does so by becoming friends with a 'bad' girl which leads to sex, drugs and theft.Is it about bad family situations? teenage angst? drugs? Maybe about everything. It is made to shock and sometimes do. The shaky, docu-style of filming is not bad but I was sometimes reminded of 'Requiem of a Dream' which is more about drugs and a true masterpiece in 'real-life' movies."
3,good movie,"I enjoyed this movie very much... especially because there was no way we could guess what she would do next. I'm the kind of person that likes to have to figure out a movie. Plus I loved Heather's hair do's. I didn't think her clothes really fit the texas area either. If you like movies that don't have too much action and suspense then you'll like this, It's a very good psychological movie according to me."
2,not a good movie,"i purchased this dvd for a good price from a good seller, but i hate to say that the movie was a junk."
2,Committed should Never have been Permitted,"COMMITTED is pretty much a movie without a story or at least a story I was able to follow. Heather Graham does nothing here that would attract anyone's attention providing that she even could. Graham seems to have flaunted her talents in obscure and nondescript films such as this. Don't bother checking this movie out because you may have yourself committed after seeing it. By the way, the cover should really give you a clue don't you think?"
3,diffrent but intresting,"ok so its not the best but it dose have its moments .ant its oringal the storys goes like so: a young couple get married far to young the hudbanb skips town leaven his wife alone ,she decides to go across the country and find him to make him see sence the weird thing is she dosent no where he is but fins him anyway thats why it go 3 stars its not realalisticbut worth a watch"
2,Independent Cutes,"This is another example of an independent film that depends on inexplicable behavior from its characters to mind humor and drama. As usual, it fails miserably. Heather Graham stars as a woman who will do anything to keep her marriage intact. This includes stalking her husband once he has left her. The movie is a complete mess. IT never decides what it is. Characters come and go for no apparent reason. Luke Wilson as the husband is attractive, but he's given nothing to do. There's a romantic subplot involving ER's Goran Visnjic, but that goes nowhere. Visnjic is the best thing in the movie. His car seat seduction of Graham is the best scene in the movie. However, This movie is a real mess."
3,Strange...but good.,"Before watching this movie I thought Heather Graham and casey Affleck - thats got to be good...and it was. I expected it to be better in the sense that the story could have been more in depth and it needed to flow faster. Aside from that the cast were great - watch out for Goran(ER) as the guy who sits with Heather Grahams character while she watches her husband - its hilarious.Committed tackles the issue's of marriage and painful break-ups but with a comedic style that really works.This movie is really good....but I'd only really recommend it if you like Heather Graham or Casey Affleck, otherwise pick it up at your rental store or catch it on TV."
4,Deep for Comedy but a Great little Sleeper,"This movie hit me at just the right time. Normally I would have turned it off as the pace was a little too leisurely but the little spiritual messages it was giving me were so perfectly spot-on that I had to watch it all. The main character reminded me of myself going through a hard time, and how a spiritual experience can look like a psychotic episode from the outside. The acting was good, the characters understandable and the road trip was a lot of fun."
5,Brings context to the Gospel,"Essential to understanding the Gospel of Jesus Christ is an understaning if the times in which He lived. There are a lot of unanswered questions as you read any of the Gospel authors. What ever happened to Joseph? Frank Sheed doesn't know for sure but he speculates and reasons. There is a lot of this in this book but he's always careful to warn you when he's doing so. Reading this book you get a feeling for the times and customs of this period of time. Part theology. Part history. Part archeological. This book brings a fullness of experience to Gospel reading. A warning though, its not a quick read. And at times the theological discussion can get a little deep, but Sheed is careful not to let these sections drag on. Take your time and read this book."
1,You get what you pay for.,"If you care about accuracy....don't bother with this try square. The hardwood is rough to the touch. When compared to my Incra Guaranteed Square the Johnson was acute by .014"" over the 8"" length. That's the width of fine pencil line, no good for fine carpentry."
1,Don't Care About Accuracy?,"If you don't care about accuracy, consider this tool. The rule part of the try square I purchased measures short about 1/64"" from the base shoe to the first inch mark. Johnson Level claimed, when I contacted them, that their stated toloreance is +/- 0.015"", close to 1/64, so I guess my tool is within their specs or very close. A tolerance of +/- 0.015"" may be ok for framing but not for woodworking. (By the way, can you find the stated tolerance in the product description?)Oregon Woodworker"
2,You get what you pay for,Bought 3 squares to find that no two where aligned at 90 degrees. A nice looking square but is only for general work.
2,Should be better,"The zero of the scale should be at the corner. It was a 16th of an inch off. This is not close enough for any kind of woodworking. Instead of returning it I send it directly to Johnson Tools. Johnson Tools did replace it. I know it only cost about $20, but still it should not of gotten past thier QC department. I'm a little disappointed in Johnson Tools, for everything else I have purchased from them has been of good to execellent quality."
1,The Johnson Not-So-Square,"The square isn't square and the rule isn't accurate. Almost a degree out of square and the rule is out about a 1/32 at 2 inches. For any modicum of precision, look somewhere else."
3,"Johnson 8"" Hardwood Try Square","I am returning this square. I compared it to my old Stanley and my Mayes try square and I found that the handle was 4 15/16"" vs Stanley 5 5/16"". Also, the blade thickness on the Johnson is not a full 1/16"" thick. The Stanley is closer to a full 1/16"" thick and the Mayes blade is 1/16"" thick. These differences are significant to me because the end of the Johnson handle digs into your hand because it is shorter and I prefer a thick blade so it won't flex. These shortcomings might be tolerable if the price wasn't high. The black graduations will give more contrast and that's good and what I really want."
1,One sip is all you'll want,"Not good - overly acidic, and the sweetness tastes... off. Even the smell is off-putting. If you're looking for sugar-free options, you can do better than this at your local supermarket."
4,You can't go wrong with Son,"This Cd is actually really good. however a good chunk of it is from his Father of the Delta Blues Cd set, and the recording quality of the other tracks is extreamly poor, so you would probable be a little better off with The Father of the Delta Blues. Even though some of the tracks are really badly recorded, it is entirly worth buying and is my favorite out of all the Martin scorsese individual artist Cds."
2,"Good Songs, but the sound quality SUCKS!","The colletion of the songs is a good selection but the sound quality of many of this is very poor, with a lot of noise in the background. You can't enjoy this cd with volume because the noise is very annoying. If you like Son House i recommend you a remastered CD."
4,The Mynn's Mystery,"I enjoyed this book on my Kindle as it is an easy read and it keeps you up a little later at night than you should be. Enjoyable and doesn't tax your mind trying to keep track of too many people, places, etc."
2,Didn't like at all. Did not read all of it.,Couldn't get interested. Only read a small portion just didn't hold my attention. Will not be looking for any more of these.Just didn't hold my interest.
2,Don't waste your money or time,"The Mynns' Mystery is predictable. It's very hard getting into it, and I have yet to MAKE myself finish it!"
3,The Mynn's Mystery,"This book was very interesting and quite good as it would be a book teenagers would read or young children to read, as it was not scarey or dangerous. It was just a little mystery that was for easy reading."
2,Worth a look but not much more.,"More of a two and a half star movie than two star. I watched this movie online and thought it was interesting to watch but had it's problems. I only knew what was going on because I'm already familiar with Frida's life. The acting was decent but the movie was very slow paced. Only recommended for diehard Kahlo fans, and knowing Spanish might be a help."
1,Bad Movie,"This movie doesn't have a dialog. All scenes are badly scripted. The sound is not synchronized and I turned it off after watching it for 40 minutes with no sequential story whatsoever, I could not stand it. Buy it at your own peril. It is really a bad dvd. Waste of my money. My opinion."
1,Absolutely Awful Rubbish.,"I wish I had read some of the reviews here before renting this awful movie recently. The director (Paul Leduc) should have never made another film after this one (but I'm sure he has). I did not like Frida (the 2002 Hollywood version) and a friend raved about this 1984 Ofelia Medina film - so I thought this might be a superior film. MAN, WAS I WRONG! Where's the script? Where's the acting? I sat thru 20 (painful) minutes of it and could view no more. Don't waste your money even renting this - let alone buying it. The 2002 Hollywood version is a very flawed film but it is atleast worthy of watching."
3,worth it,"the movie was all right and the animation wasnt bad. the plot could have used a little work but they get the point across. there was plenty of violence, blood, and gore for those who are fans of ""Fist of the NorthStar"". overall it was worth seeing"
3,Below adverage,"This movie is a below adverage anime about scientist who gets posessed by the god of evil, goes on a rampage to destroy half the city and then miraculously regains his humanity all for the sake of love.Avoid it, unless your snowed in and stuck with nothing but this movie.You're be better off watching anime's like - Jin-Roh, Spriggan, Nausicaa, Wings over Honnemaise, Princess Mononoke, Shadow Skill, Escaflowne."
1,WASTE OF GOOD MONEY,I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE. IT LASTED TWO YEARS. HAD THE BATTERY REPLACED BUT THAT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM. THREW IT INTO THE DRESSER JUNK DRAWER. HINT: BUY A SEIKO OR TIMEX. THEY KEEP PERFECT TIME JUST LIKE AN OVER PRICED OMEGA.
2,Seamaster loses time,I have a mid-size men's quartz Seamaster 120 meters I purchased 6 years ago that now sporadically looses a couple of minutes a day or just stops. \I have had the battery replaced twice in the last two months at a good local watch shop. They say there is nothing they can do. Disappointing quality. I would not buy Omega again.
3,Beware of the size description,"This watch is a mid-size watch, not 41.5mm as descripted. All other watches is sized by their diameter, this watch decided to dscript the size by including the crown, very deceptive....."
3,camp,"Good axe, just wish that it was not all plastic, if you are a sure swing then its ok but if someone is not them be prepared to buy a new one."
1,"Lacking in useful information, badly organized.","There are few guides to Pittsburgh, don't waste time and money on this one.Information in the guide is organized and formatted poorly (ie., there is little or no differentiation between lodging and attractions.) Hotels may be listed in different sections of town, yet be relatively close to each other.Many popular attractions are not mentioned at all.Maps are not very detailed and attractions are not well labeled on them.Comments on lodging are overly glowing (they go on and on), and do not have complete, relevant information. For example, it is mentioned that there is an airport shuttle to downtown hotels, but not that it charges a fee, or how much that fee is.In short, compared to other travel books I have purchased, this one is a big dissapointment."
4,Outstanding Guide on Pittsburgh,"I read the first review, and I was baffled. This is not the book I have. The accommodations are clearly defined, chapter by chapter. The Pittsburgh area, which is difficult to find your way around, is divided into sensible areas. I guess if I have a negative point, it is the descriptions are too in-depth, with too much information. Otherwise, with so few travel guides on Pittsburgh, this one worked great."
3,Batgirl overrides Batman,The sodding story of Batgirl will keep you in the mood. But don't expect much of the story. You'll have a nice time reading it but it has its flaws. The last pages are long and boring compared to the beginning of the book but is a readable one.
1,Description needs correction,On product description it is listed as being 1.5 lbs. The actual weight is listed below on shipping weight as 4 ounces.
1,Sized wrong,This product is much smaller than the description and image indicates. 5 of them together do not weigh a full pound.
5,Versatile stick lubricant.,Got it to lubricate metal zippers. Learned it works well on a lot of things. Really handy.
5,Love Never Dies,"I waited a long time to see this follow on ,from Phantom of the Opera .Very well made, but I didnt like the ending much."
3,Disappointing,BluRay has beautiful photography and scenery but lacks the expected memorable melodies typical of Andrew LLoyd Webber. I rate it as OK but not outstanding.
5,Well Worth the Wait!,"I have been a huge Phantom of the Opera fan for years. I have a room full of Phantom of the Opera memorabilia, so you can understand when this movie was available for pre-order I jumped on the bandwagon. Well, the DVD arrived this afternoon and within 10 minutes it was in the DVD player. I was already familiar with the music as I have purchased the soundtrack, but I was breathless watching the production. I waited so long for a sequel to this love story and was not disappointed. I am so curious and dumbfounded as to why it did not do well in London. I had read The Phantom of Manhattan and the story is based upon it; I thought the production was done very well. It is hard to fit a whole book into a little over two hours, but it was portrayed quite well. I am so happy to finally have the opportunity to see this show. Very well done and I highly recommend."
2,the sequel,"I had so enjoyed the phantom and hum the tunes even now. The sequel has wonderful singers, beautiful sets, great orchestration, and a dramatic story to tell, but the music doesn't sing in my head. Not a disappointment, just not the stellar music of the original."
3,not a good sequel,"My family and I loved Phantom of the Opera, so we decided to rent the sequel, Love Never Dies, from Netflix this weekend. We found it to be rather disappointing. The stage production is pretty good but the story and songs aren't up to the same caliber as Phantom."
3,disappointed,"I was hoping for more from this DVD. If you loved Phantom of the Opera and were expecting something similar you will be disappointed. I'm waiting to watch it again, when I can be more objective now that I know it's no Phantom! There were some nice songs, but the story line was lacking something."
5,LoveitLoveitLoveit!!!!!!!!,"I heard Wbber was making a sequel to POTO.I didn't approve.Then I saw this production.Now I approve.Damn you, Webber."
2,disappointed,"I liked the beginning and very end , the guy who played the Phantom was great, but I was disappointed that Weber did not carry the same love story theme from the original play and the 2004 movie , I would like to have seen him pick another opera house , but Coney Island NY , give me a break !!!!"
2,Andrew Lloyd Webber killed The Phantom,"I remember when I first saw the movie, The Phantom of the Opera, after reading the Leroux novel. I was completely satisfied until the end when The Phantom does not die of heartache like in the novel, but has to suffer the pain of losing Christine. This ending, of course, was one of the reasons Andrew Lloyd Webber decided to make a sequel. When I watched this Love Never Dies movie, I thought that The Phantom and Raoul had totally switched personalities. It was so strange. Nothing was much of a surprise to me until the very ending. Andrew Lloyd Webber made a worst ending than the first. I didn't feel the same message that the original musical was trying to give us. The 2 things I actually enjoyed was the music and the visuals. I don't think this DVD is worth buying. I believe you should rent this movie, if you're dying to see it."
3,Love Never Dies . . . A Poor Follow-Up to The Phantom,This Follow-Up to The Phantom of The Opera was a terrible disappointment . . . NOT up to the standards set by Andrew Lloyd Webber . . . Don't waste your time.
4,Music is gorgeous.,"I really enjoyed this DVD. The music is wonderful and the show is certainly not as bad as some of the reviews indicate. It was recorded live but you miss out on the audience throughout the show. That made it feel more like a movie then a show. If you are a Phantom fan, see this one."
1,Horrible,I am a HUGE fan of Phantom of the Opera but this story RUINS it. They should have left it alone. Not worth the $3.99 I paid to rent it.
5,Pleasantly surprised...,"I had not seen any clips nor heard any songs before buying this dvd, though I had read the original book on which the basic story was based ('The Phantom of Manhattan' by Frederick Forsyth). So I really had no idea what to expect but I bought it because 1) I'm a POTO fan and 2) Andrew Lloyd Webber.In short - this is a tremendous show. Buy it immediately.I disagree with those reviewers that say the music is nothing special. I love the music (and have bought the cd). Several songs in particular stand out: 'The Beauty Underneath' (a visual feast and a wonderful song sung by the Phantom and Christine's son, Gustav), 'Devil Take the Hindmost' (Raoul and a spectacularly sinister Phantom), and 'Love Never Dies' (Christine's signature song which always brings tears to my eyes). Don't take me wrong - I don't think there's a bad song in the entire show, these are just my favorites.I could go on and on but I won't bore you. Watch it for yourself and make up your own mind."
1,Just Pitiful,"I love Phantom of the Opera so much and the music is beautiful. So I just knew this was going to be awesome. Well it's not, it's pitiful, there is not one good song in it and the story line doesn't fit with what happened in Phantom. I would not recommend this movie. Don't waste your money or time. Sad to say it simply is not worth it."
1,"Phantom , Hieronymus Bosch - style","Imagine Tim Burton or David Lynch getting the go ahead to do a sequal to Phantom, only with the sensibilities of Ed wood, and you get an idea of what this is like. Add production design inspired by Hieronymus Bosch and you have...oh, I don't know. Words escape me. Sitting there watching this, I must have looked like an audience member watching ""Springtime for Hitler"" in Mel Brook's The Producers. If thie hadn't been linked to Webber's THE PHANTOM, I might have enjoyed it as an incredibly tacky spectacle, like the Rocky Horror Picture Show. However,for me, it sullies the memories of the original, and it's going to take some time to forget this ever existed."
5,"""Love Never Dies""..the DVD","I think that Andrew Lloyd Webber adapted ""Love Never Dies"" from a book ""The Phantom of New York"" by Fredrick Forseyth...We picked up the book ten years or so in an off the wall bookstore in San Diego and enjoyed it very much...It is a continuation of Webber's ""Phantom of The Opera"" in New York City...I'm not sure the mucical ever hit Broadway, but know that it did well in London's West End...Never heard much more about it but it appeared on PBS in May 2012 and we watched and enjoyed it as well....Did not know that a CD and DVD was availible until the PBS showing....It is a good experience for Phantom fans who wonder what became of him after the Opera House in Paris....We were pleased to find it availible at Amazon....JJJ"
2,Watch if You Dare,This was so unnecessary. So very very not needed. Did I mention redundant? Really they thought this was a good idea? I demand a different musical one in which Christine dumps both their whiny asses.
3,Not on par with Movie,"This sequel lacked the passion, the charisma, the magnetisim of the Movie Phantom of the Opera.The chemistry between Christine and Erik just wasnt there in this sequel. I had hoped to hear threads of the original music throughout the background but was barely noticible which led to a let down of the creshendo at the end. Altough I will have to admit the ending was quite powerful."
4,Fantastic!,"I took my wife to see this performance in London, yes, Phoenix to London to see a play and it was the greatest experience's in my life. I have not seen the dvdbut just found out I can pre-order it. Best news of the new year for me. When this play comes to the States we will going to as many openings as possible!!! Buy the DVD and enjoy. If you like Phantom of the Opera this is a must watch.The performance is amazing and music is some of the best of ALW. Till I Here You Sing, will tear you up it is beautiful."
2,Not for THIS fan of the original Phantom musical!,"I could hardly make it through this show. Maybe it would have been better had I seen the show in person first, but it was painful. As someone who has seen the Phantom of the Opera musical over 10 times on stage and who loves the movie version featuring Gerard Butler, I was really hoping to fall in love with Love Never Dies. Not the case. Very disappointing to see how Andrew Lloyd Webber saw the story continue as that's not how I would have liked to see things turning out after the end of Phantom of the Opera. And I didn't like any of the songs either. I will be looking to sell my blu-ray as I won't be watching this again."
2,Plot Changes that ruin the original,"Oh boy where do I even begin!!First let me say that what I am about to write will be SPOILERS, So read no further unless you want to know what happens.They actually changed things about the original Phantom of the Opera (POTO) to try to make this sequel work and it was very disappointing!Any of you who have seen POTO remember the final lair scene where Christine kisses Erik (phantom) and the look on his face is just pure shock because no one has EVER kissed him or shown him any affection at all.Now in the sequel Love Never Dies it turns out that Christines son is actually Eriks......COME ON!!! and you find out that they actually made love one night all those years ago.So then why did Erik act so shocked when Christine kissed him in POTO?I just feel this sequel was a feeble attemp to make more cash off of POTO.I actually felt mad and disgusted watching this."
1,Just not the same!,I was very disappointed with the music... guess I couldn't get past the Phantom of the Opera to be fair. I still haven't watched all of the video. Just can't hang in there!
1,Depressing,The movie arrived in time but the movie is terrible. The story is not well written and the music is terrible.
1,SOMEONE TAKE THIS MESSAGE TO ALW.,"(singers and orcherstra is great)I hope someone makes this humble opinion reach the eyes of ALW.I was surprised when I, at the extras, saw ALW talking about this musical.WTF is that? - Even the music is not original.The main music belongs to another musical - THE HEART IS SLOW TO LEARN.I wasted the money, the time - but that's not the most important:ALW, I was disappointed with you. You didn't need to do that. Really.Man, do you need the money? If so, please re-run other musicals.Question: How possible Christine be in love with the Phantom? And more than that, they have a son???Did the Phantom raped Christine and she enjoyed?Can we assume there is will the sequel to this musical - perhaps with the same score of Evita??? - I like Evita.Now to the person willing to buy this blu-ray: - Simply DON'T. Keep loving the ALW you know. Don't taint your admiration for him."
1,Catastrophy,"This was an absolutely abominable sequel; abysmal story line, contrived characters, with a banal score. This is simply a catastrophy. It took a beautifully layered story that ultimately opts for light and life and twists it into a dark and incomprehensible follow up to the original. While the sets and costuming were lovely it is extremely difficult to fathom that the genius of Andrew Lloyed Webber conceived of this tripe; it is really the antithesis of the Phantom Of The Opera. Ultimately a huge disappointment and complete waste of time."
1,Love Never Dies?,I thoroughly disliked Love Never Dies. Nothing in it appealed to me. I purchased the DVD on a friend's recommendation & now must really question her taste. I thought the story ridiculous & the songs downright ugly. Nancy
2,"A completely different kind of ""Opera""","Oh...dear. Well, the book and lyrics and plot are way sub standard and different from the ""Phantom"". They make no sense, the characters would NEVER have followed this plotline. The music is much modernized, which is fine, but haradly any of original music or tunes, no ""Opera either. However, the sets, actors and costumes are great. Expect no romance. Better it wssn't tried. There is a little boy that is absolutely terrific all the way through. Best thing about it."
3,Disappointing,"We were disappointed with the musical. It really isn't up to Lloyd Webber's standard. The first act was so boring that we nearly turned it off, but we stayed with it to the end. The second act was much more satisfying."
2,Maybe Love Dies After All,"A sequel to Phantom of the Opera may have been an impossible task. This was certainly a disappointment. Raoul has certainly gone downhill fast. Also, it appears that the Phantom did a bit more to Christine then just sing to her. You'd think that she might have figured out he was a man and not an angel a bit faster in the original. In any event, except for ""Devil Take the Hindmost"" the music wasn't all that good, and I liked neither the plot nor the ending. The author of the book is certainly rolling over in his grave."
2,"Great music, poor storyline","I have been looking forward to seeing this play for several years now, and was sadly disappointed by it. Andrew Lloyd Webber does not disappoint with his music, but the storyline leaves a lot to be desired. I will not spoil anything, but I find the story inconsistent with the original, which really bugged me because I love the original play so much. I also didn't care for half the characters (the actors in the cast were terrific--it was the characters themselves who were rather boring). If I could make this purchase again, I'd skip getting the DVD and just buy the soundtrack."
3,Andrew Lloyd Weber's Love Never Dies,"Our family eagerly anticipated watching the sequel to the ""Phantom of the Opera"". We were disappointed to find not so much a sequel as a revised future to the story. All the beloved characters from ""Phantom"" are here, but personalities and lifelines may have been altered. I don't want to give too much away, since if you can handle the revisions it is an enjoyable story. We we just jarred by going in expecting a true sequel. May this review give you the information you need to enjoy this musical for what it is; a possible new future for old favorites."
3,2/3 Excellent and 1/3 Horrific,"Andrew Lloyd Webber has out done himself in composing some of his most beautiful, melodic and passionate music. Unfortunately he has combined it with his absolute worst.Moving the continuation of his original plot to Coney Island from Paris cheapens the story and the production.All of the performers are excellent but the singer/actor Ben Lewis is outstanding in every way.This work could succeed on the world stage by jettissoning the extraneous plot complications----particularly the vulgar, hideous scenes of the Coney Island shows!!"
4,Love Never Dies,"I thought this stage production, filmed in Australia was wonderful. The vocalists, the sets and the colour excels!My only comment that having been filmed live, the camera angles were not always accurate and in the darker scenes the blacks were a little on the grey side. There was also some distractive light wandering into the black bands at the top and bottom of my 16:9 screen. The soundtrack deserves merit.I thoroughly recommend this blu-ray disc."
3,Not his best,"The voices are excellent and some of the songs memorable. I am a great fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber but this is not even close to his best musical. The story is very dark and does not tie in with The Phantom of The Opera. To be a ""sequel"" it should follow the previous story and this does not do that. I did enjoy the fact that it was a theater production and not a movie."
1,D.O.A.,This was a real disappointment. Wish I had previewed it before I bought it.Stick with the original production. Too bad ALW didn't.
1,2 hours of my life I will never get back,"I never leave bad reviews, but as a true Phantom fan, I have to say... don't waste your time, don't waste your money. This is nothing morte than a pathetic money grab. Wished I would not have seen this horrible sequel."
3,"Good Musical, But Leaves One Lacking","In this follow-up to Phantom of the Opera, it is a reach on so many levels. After seeing both Broadway productions, traveling productions and the made for screen film, I have been a fan of the Webber version of Phantom. I realize that each musical is unique, but this is not one of the great ones you come to expect from Mr. Webber. The soundtrack does not have a single outstanding song to focus upon afterward to bring back images of the musical.The overall story is great and grows each of the characters Phantom, Christine and Raoul. The most talented singer from this musical was by the Phantom's Ben Lewis. The rest of the cast was good, but not to the level expected for this size of production.It was a good attempt by Mr. Webber, but not ever venture will be a great hit. Watch it for what it is and do not expect too much from this musical."
4,"Absolutely spectacular, but...............","Having read several of the most recent reviews, I find myself agreeing with many of them. Personally, I thought the production and costumes were fantastic and the music and singing both melodic and memorable. My only issue is with the ending. It needs to be ""tidied up"" a bit. After the shocking climax, it takes just a little too long to actually end. At the risk of giving anything away, I will just leave it at that. If you are at all thinking about getting this DVD, you will not be disappointed if you do."
3,"Okay, but completely different from the UK version.","I wish that the UK version of this musical had been filmed, rather than the Australian one. I have owned the original soundtrack since 2010, and don't like how the songs were changed for this version. I had purchased this with excitement, and from the moment it started, I was filled with disappointment.The soundtrack moves me almost immediately when I start listening to it, it draws me in quickly and keeps me entranced for the entire 2:20; this version skips any and all setup that the soundtrack has, and jumps straight into storyline, which is cut down to 2:01. Entire sections are completely different, conversations had have different characters having them.. it doesn't flow nearly as well as the original version.If you get the chance and the time to listen to it, listen to the UK soundtrack, especially if you feel as though this show isn't up to par. It could change your mind."
5,ALW fan!,I am in love with all Sir Webbers works. This is the post Phantom musicial. Was done in London and not received well. Australia took this and reworked it and than taped it. Lots of plots and sub-plots. This is the way the 1st POTO should have ended but than we would have missed the 2nd one. About 4 of the songs will make it out of the show. Most are up to his usual excellence. The actors/singers are superb. Very well done.
1,"Functional, But Not As Advertised","This bag serves its purpose, but beware, features as pictured are misleading if not completely misrepresented. When I order a product from (what I believe to be) a reputable company, I expect that company to deliver. Features presented include a ""media case"" and a clip in zip-style cd case. The media sleeve comes equipped with Velcro strips, but no place in the case to attach the sleeve. The cd case apparently is not provided with the case; should so state. Unfortunately, the clip-in feature represented in photos does not exist. Conclusion, shoddy advertising or totally misrepresented. Very dissatisfied."
5,"Professional, stylish, compact - need I say more?","I first received this as a gift for Christmas almost 3 years ago. And I can say, with complete honesty, that 3 years later I still am using it and wouldn't even think of trying anything else. Every inch is padded, which makes me feel good about protection for my Mac. Unlike almost every other case on the market, it's actually comfortable to wear - for long periods of time. Most importantly, it's not bulky or large at all. Everything fits in a nice, compact area. It looks (and works) great in professional settings. And still looks pretty cool on the back of a motorcycle. How many bags can you say that about?"
2,Buy another clock,"This appears to be a very cheaply made clock. The cover for the battery broke when first opened, and had to be taped on. The clock takes a ""D"" size battery, not AA as stated in the description. The optional full time light was good, as was the ascending alarm. Setting time was very easy."
2,Bulkier than expected,This alarm clock is actually quite heavy. It looks small in the picture but since it takes a D battery it is too bulky for traveling light.
2,Defective!!!!,"After being a loyal Amazon customer for a few years...I've now received a defective product and I'm not very happy about it, but considering the very low, low price of this Alarm Clock, it's not worth the time or effort to return it and wait for a replacement. It's going right into the trash. The numbers don't display all the way, except for the ""1"", so unless I have a rough idea of what time of day or night it might be, I can then guess at the hour and minute. It has a defective display and teaches me once more that you get what you pay for!!!"
4,"Good, except for the African Recordings","Every song on this compilation is awesome except for the recordings because ITS NOT BLUES! The best songs on this cd would have to be John Lee Hooker ones, or maybe the Charley Patton song."
5,Worked for my sliding door to backyard,"Got it for broken latch for my sliding backyard door...I had to adjust little bit where I install, before installing...Older one was longer...Good product and it works..."
3,Same as his other video just different cover,This is the same video as his Salsa/ Merengue video with a more modern cover. It is a good beginners traditional Salsa. Cal also sells a British version with again a different cover.
5,One of the first (and best) Blues singers......,"An excellent collection of songs at a reasonable price for those looking to get a taste of some of the earliest blues out there from the works of Robert Johnson.Robert Johnson only recorded 41 songs over a two summer timeframe, and of those 41, 29 are duplicates of songs already recorded by him. So while some may say it is wise to just go out and buy the box set of Robert Johnson, I would argue that this CD makes sense for those who are uncertain whether they will like early delta blues. This CD contains 14 out of the 29 songs ever recorded by Robert Johnson. I love it, but must admit I am perplexed as to why 2 additional Robert Johnson songs recorded by other blues artists were included. Quite honestly, I would have rather have had more Robert Johnson material to listen to. But for the price, I don't think I can complain. Not the best of the Martin Scorcese series, but certainly a laudable effort."
5,Incredible movie!,"I bought this same film in France. After some weeks, i put in my dvd and it's ok; no problem. About the movie, is wonderfull, hipnotic and simply ludic."
1,Lousy product,"I just bought the 14"" version of this for my 14"" iBook and I was very disappointed. There were a lot of problems with this sleeve:1. It's specifically supposed to fit my 14"" iBook, but it doesn't. It has 2"" too much space all around - no snug fit.2. It's supposed to have padded protection for the laptop but the flap that closes the sleeve is not padded - which means if the laptop hits a surface on that side, there is no protection.3. It's supposed to be waterproof but only the fabric is waterproof - the way the bag is constructed, water can easily seep in at the flap (there is no zipper).Needless to say, I'm sending this back!"
3,"Ok, but not great...","For those who are not familiar with Tatsuo Sunaga this cd will not sound like a traditional mix. Sunaga T's albums are better described as ""complied"" with a few of his own actual songs. As far as Very Best of Fpm in the Mix: Tatsuo Sunaga Mix , it something to listen to and enjoy if you like Fantastic Plastic as he is. Don't buy this cd, it you are expecting a remix."
4,Solid Effort,"This a great cd by an up and coming artist. The things I like about this effort is that the music encompasses several different styles and still maintains a raw edge. It seems that Reilly draws from rock, punk, hip-hop, ballads to produce a solid effort. Another feature of this disc that I love is the lack of over production found on so many releases these days. This disc reminds me of ""Exile on Main Street"" by the Rolling Stones. The music is solid and the production is loose. There are times during the disc were the musicians and producer can be heard talking about recording strategies and I also like how the songs tend to blend into each other without much dead air. As I mentioned earlier in this review this disc also is comparable to ""Exile"" in that several different styles of music are covered and they all covered well. This a great cd and I look forward to more releases from Ike Reilly."
5,Long Live Rock and Roll,Take note of this gem of an album. This is one of the best Rock 'n Roll albums to arrive in years - let alone the Summer of 2001.This album stand out... head and shoulders above others. It is the oasis in a desert of unimaginative or over produced garbage. It is about time a voice rises above the din and demands the attention of your ear... without abusing the privilege.This is one album to enjoy repeatedly - and for years to come.Rock on Reilly...
4,Geed reference...,"A really good reference book one with lots of information. However, if you find working with math a problem and equations aren't your thing, then this might not be the book for you."
2,what the???,Better off buying John Legenfelter's book how build a small block Chevy!!! This book sucks unless you are teaching 11th graders about a sbc....
4,Corny Fun,"I teach the unabridged version of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer to my middle school students and I wanted them to compare the book to a movie. This film is closer to the book than many other versions, so it's a useful resource. At first, the kids were groaning because the movie is so old fashioned and corny, but by the end, they were cheering. The movie led to a good discussion about why certain scenes were not included in the film version, and it also led to conversations about use of stereotypes in media. I wish someone would make a new Tom Sawyer movie."
2,Not Up To My Expectations.,This film was not up to my expectations. It was over-acted and only a very basic copy of the original story. The goings on between Tom and his brother were over-done and became tedious. The fence painting scenario was not credible and left a lot to the imagination. I'm afraid I did not see this movie to its conclusion.
4,The Prof's Choice,"Our oldest just started college this fall (2009), and her Econ Prof. was so adamant about having this Econ text, he had the kids send back a perfectly good Econ text for this one, so he was quite sure this is what was needed. There is also an inexpensive study guide with which it goes.(When I said the texts they sent back were ""perfectly good"", I meant I'd read through the text and study guide, I found them to be sound, as well as a good teaching tool.)These are the two our daughter's Prof insists upon. His insistance, combined with my own review, as well as our daughters', is what I base my rating upon. I'm sure you'd like more info, and I'm sorry not to be able to provide it, but I was unable to have the text long enough to give a really good going over.Also, an aside.. I believe one of the previous reviewers was inadvertently reviewing the study guide, and not this book, which is the textbook.)Thanks for your time!"
2,Errors abound,"The study guide was kind of useful, but it often asked pointless questions about details with which we were completely unconcerned in my Intro Microeconomics class. Also, it often gave the wrong answers for multiple choice questions, resulting in such inaccurate assertions as ""The statement that firms in competitive markets are price takers means that average cost equals marginal cost at the minimum of average cost."" It contradicted the book as well, defining the long run average cost curve as the straight line running along the bottom of the short-run curves when in actuality such a curve is the minimum average cost curve, and it bizarrely defined the real product wage as the marginal product divided by the product price. This last error wasn't exactly a typo, because it appeared twice. I can only imagine how many microeconomics students this study guide has misled and confused."
5,easy install,I used this to replace a burnt out door lock actuator and couldn't be happier. This package came with everything I needed for the install and more. I highly recommend this item :)
4,good quality,"Good Quality heavy duty Door lock motor. Came with All parts required to install, including cable to run to the alarm."
5,Powerful and sturdy!,I used this to make my pickup tailgate key fob locking/unlocking. It is so convenient now! I have no idea why this isn’t standard on pickups. Installation was a breeze and it’s both powerful and sturdy. I expect that this product will outlast the truck. Highly recommended!
4,As expected,these where great in adding power locks to a Jeep LJ.the came with all needed hardware only required the pair of relays.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM FOR THE CINGULAR 8125!!,this belt clip is designed for the MDA...NOT the cingular 8125/8100....they are 2 totally different shapes and your phone will not fit into this holster...
1,Item does not properly fit the MDA.,This is a very cheaply made product.It does not properly fit the MDA.Once you have it in the holster it is EXTREMELY hard to get out.Ratcheting mechanism is not the best either.This product is very poor for the money.If it was free I would still send it back!!!
2,Fits Well But Not Long-Lasting,"I was pleased with the Swivel Belt Holster because it allowed me to quickly and easily remove my 8125 smartphone when I wanted to use it.The problem is the clip slipped from my belt and the holster and the phone fell to the ground. One of the""ears"" broke off the holster so that it is no longer usable.The holster is made from a hard, brittle plastic that cannot stand the least bit of shock. I would pay more for a similar holster design made from a softer, unbreakable plastic material.Les Pattin"
3,One good cartoon paired with a lackluster one,"I will keep this short. Elf bowling: The movie, is not a high quality cartoon. In fact, it is only perfect as riffing material. Christmas is Here again, however, is an excellent cartoon that deserves to be better-known. While getting this combo is cheaper then buying both movies new, I would recommend just getting Christmas is Here again by itself and renting elf bowling."
5,Great for Sports,"Many european tennis coaches recommend taking these tablets and they actually work really well! I use 2 when I wake up and 2 when I sleep, I definitely feel faster recovery in terms of pain and sore muscles after a long day of workout.Definitely a good value and choice.The only CONS is that its hard to chew the tablet is really big compared to other tablets out there which may be annoyance to younger children."
5,Great Book for Beginners!,"This is a great book for beginners as well as others. I really enjoyed all the recipes and information about the products. The hairstyles are great too. You can find all of this information on natural hair websites but it's also good to have much of it in one place. The information for the ""no-poo"" is great. I must say that I disagree with her suggesting not to wear micro-braids. I have had great forutune with my micros and they have grown my hair out tremendously. I think she should have stressed the importance of maintaining micros. I use essential oils and water on my micros. I also wash them every two weeks and I have seen tremendous growth. Other than that one complaint, I have really enjoyed this book. It is a keeper!"
4,"Black, Natural Hair is MAGNIFICENT!!","This book offers great suggestions on how to care for Black and African natural hair textures. I loved the fact that there are pictures of beautiful hair styles on the front cover and on the inside. The author also describes the practicality of natural hair vs. relaxed hair, and that many people are actually mislead to believe natural hair is more costly and time consuming. This book is a must have for anyone who is thinking of going natural or has natural hair."
4,Pretty Good Book,"This book is perfect for someone who absolutely knows nothing about natural hair. Since, I did know some things, this book just repeated everything I already knew."
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping to find new information here that I did not find off the internet from websites like Nappturality, Motown girl, and other nappy sites. I have been transitioning for 4 months. I have relaxed my hair for most of my life. I must be honest, it makes me think that I could have written this book. It is nothing more than a pamphlet with an advertising plug to the writers' website to buy products. Much too expensive for the ""information"" provided. I could have given it 1 star but I do not have the heart."
3,An okay book,"I enjoyed this book for some of the photos of hairstyles, however, the information contained in this book can be found on sites like [...] for free. In fact, when you visit the author's website you are required to pay a subscription fee to access information (this, even after you've already purchased her book.)Some of the recipes she lists for natural hair care don't have measurements so you're left trying to figure out how much of an ingredient you should use. ""Have I put in too much rosemary?"" ""How much spring water does she mean?"" ""What's the ratio of coconut oil to honey?"" I was left asking myself these very questions.I wouldn't recommend this book to a friend only because you can find the same information (and better) elsewhere for free."
3,OK but not great,I thought this book was ok not really what I was looking for but hey I did read some of the book. It would be better if the pictures were in color. I think I can find a lot of this information on youtube.
5,Excellent book,"Great little book full of hairstyles, advice and diy hair products! I told everyone who is natural that I know about this book : )"
4,Its Informative but nothing that I didnt already know.,"I would reccomend this book to someone who had no idea about ANYTHING concerning going natural or natural hair at all. If your someone whos looking for a good begginers guide to going natural, finding products, styles, looking up common terms then this would be a great book for you, but if your already searching online, in hair forums, or watching youtube you already have about 95% of this knowledge this book offers. I will keep it in my collection as a reviewers guide!"
5,going natural,dlivered on time and has lots of useful infomation and how to care for black hair and what to exepect during the transfomation
4,Nice book,"Started my journey to transitioning my hair from relaxed to natural. This is the first book I read. Easy read, and great suggestions. I started making a laundry list of products to buy."
4,Very helpful!!!!!!!!!,"Great book to start your transition or your journey of accepting, caring and loving your natural hair.They are many websites that are helpful too but this book is a first step."
5,BEST NATURAL GUIDE,"20+ years relaxed, enough already! I love this guide, chock full of photos, definitions,styles and great advice. The author knows what she is talking about. Do not hesitate to make this your 'go-to' book for transistioning."
4,Informative Book,"This book was very detailed and informative. I am eight months into my transition from relaxed to natural. This book is a must read for those who wish to transition. The book also contains various hairstyles you can wear, ingredients to avoid, ingredients to use and much more."
4,a struggle between the power of love and power of anger,"Since the death of his beloved wife, Sloan McCord is an embittered loner who needs a woman to care for his infant daughter and oversee his home. Burdened by family debts, Heather Ashford agrees to a cold marriage of convenience with the ruggedly handsome rancher. Despite the arrangement,Heather soon responds to Sloan's brooding sensuality. Craving affection from the distant man, Heather must first heal Sloan's damaged heart--before he breaks hers. We see the development of the relation between them and how Sloan admires Heather's persistance to gain his love. The novel exemplifies the struggle between the power of love that Heather has for Sloan and his anger and vulgarity after his wife's death"
2,More like HeartLESS,"The title Heart Breaker doesn't apply. Who's supposed to be the heartbreaker? I was expecting the hero to be some sort of rake, a love-em-and-leave-em type. Oh, was it supposed to be Sloan? How can that be, when he has a heart made of stone? He was so cold and cruel towards Heather. And she was no better herself, accepting that sort of treatment from him. Even the local ladies didn't stand a chance against that icicle of an heart. Exactly WHAT did these women see in him anyway?I usually enjoy Nicole Jordan's books. One of the better ones are Prince of Pleasure, Wicked Fantasy, and yes, even the most recent one, Fever Dreams. At least the heroes had FEELINGS. And they weren't hypocrites like Sloan was, using another woman as a sex object even as he was supposedly still honoring his deceased wife.I would highly recommend Petals on the River by Kathleen Woodiwiss, which has the same plot (widower in need of a wife), but with much warmer characters."
2,The story & characters are good but to much extreme sex,I enjoyed the story &characters but she had to much extreme sex & inappropate words in reguard to the sex .Very offencive.
3,Too much,"Shades of Grey meets Little House.Too much sexual voicing of what they are doing and nothing is left up to the mind.Where is the romance, the love.It was an okay book."
3,BRides 2,Like these earlier books as the emotions are stronger than her later works. Would recommend to my family and friends
5,In a word.....AWESOME!!!,"I am not a huge fan of Western historicals, I usually read Medievel, but I was so swept up in this book that I want to read all of Ms. Jordans other books. This book was awesome! Not very many books make my heart physically ache but this one did. I felt so bad for Heather. How could she not love the hell out of Sloan. What a man. I did think that he was a huge jerk to her throughout the entire book and I think she should have let him sweat a little more before she went back to him but I understand why she had a hard time resisting him. I am very impressed with Nicole's writing. It is fast paced and she draws you in to a hot (and I mean hot!) luscious story. I can't wait to read the next one."
4,Manning Knows Grace,"Brennan Manning writes an intelligent treatise of the subject of God's grace. His seasoned language and personal examples guide the reader through a concept many Christians find difficult to grasp: how can a perfect God care so much for His very imperfect people. If you struggle with the miracle of grace and tend to artifically attach strings to God's love, read this book, then re-read it. I have purchased 8 copies to give to friends and after 4 weeks, I'm all out."
1,"Hard to read, and abbreviated","The message and writing was superb. But the VISUAL edition is VERY hard to read (too much 'art' on page backgrounds.) Also, I found out this 'visual' book is merely 'excerpts' from the 'whole book'. I will be buying THAT in the future, though. This is a wonderful bit of bait, but not what I thought I was ordering."
5,Great message,We both enjoyed reading the great message in this book and have passed it along to a couple of other people.
3,ragamuffin,it's okay - thanks for sending it - sorry I didn't confirm earlier. I did get it okay and have read it -
4,Ragamuffin Gospel,I have read this book several times and have often given it away. I gave it to several members of my family for Christmas and kept a copy for myself. Brennan Manning creates word pictures that describe the doctrine of grace. I'll be giving more copies away.
4,Interesting read!,This was the first book from Brennan Manning that I have read. I love how he shares the Gospel and just shares that God loves us no matter what. I think its easy to feel like we constantly let God down by our sins. But it is refreshing to remember that we were never holding him up to let him down.I received this book free from Waterbrookmultnomah for my honest review.
3,"A lot of grace, maybe too much","At first I started to dislike this book. Grace is a wonderful thing, learning of the Lord is needed, but all of this seemed a little too much for me. Maybe I am a legalist or a moralist, but it seemed to cheapen grace. One line resounds in my head, ""in heaven there will be prostitutes, con-men, and corporate CEO's."" There will be certainly these people in heaven, for the grace of God has no limits on forgiveness. But the author presented them as acting in these sins. Just a little too much for me. But as I read, I did enjoy and needed the message of resounding love ringing in my heart. The book motived me and inspired me to preach more on the merciful love of God. The book was too unbalanced for me, but the message of love warmed my heart and soul."
5,Loved it,"I absolutely loved this book. It's true that he says a lot of controversial things, but it's very thought-provoking. It caused me to take a long hard look at my spirituality. For a long time I felt like I didn't measure up to God's expectations and I was constantly frustrated because I never felt like I was good enough. Now I know I'm not good enough -- and it's okay! I am loved anyway. :) Brennan Manning does a beautiful job illuminating God's love."
3,more used than i expected,"the book had quite a lot of writing and highlighting in it, which made it rather annoying. don't think this book was rated well on use."
4,The Ragamuffin Gospel,"A very inspiring book by a former Catholic Priest who has rediscovered, the fact that true belief in God comes from grace, not from works, the concept which occurred to Luther and thus launched the Reformation. The author has unique insights which are really refreshing and inspiring."
4,Mixed review,"The Ragamuffin Gospel is at best, a secular attempt at trying to explain the effects of kowing and under standing the real one and only true Gospel. It should not be mistaken for the true gospel. In and of it's self,it is not the road to your personal salvation. Some critics POO POO it on the premiss that the reader might be miss led into thinking that it is a way to personal salvation.I contend that all roads lead to heaven, BUT "" Strait is the gate and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life,and few there be that find it"" Matthew 7 ;14. Thanks DBWerlein"
4,"Great Visuals, Saturated, High Impact","Pros: Fantastic photographic visuals, choices of layout, high impact layout, cuts right to the chase and meat.Cons: (maybe just my luck with a bad copy) binding immediately fell apart; advertisements for this production don't tell you this is a 10% version of the original book (only the best lines are set to great photography layout), so if you're looking for the full text don't buy this one."
5,felt ragged,"soaked this book up as a dry sponge would water. the truth it speaks allowed my heart to exhale. buy more then one, you will give the first one away."
5,A must.,"This book belongs in your bible study arsenal!! If you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend it. No one understands the furious longing of God more than Brennan Manning and his mission is for you and I to understand his love for us."
3,A Ragamuffin Book,"As I read this book, I was conflicted in my reactions. I alternated between jotting words of wisdom I found it it into my personal journal, and desiring to label it a work of Pop Psychology and 12-Step Catholicism. Then it dawned on me: This is precisely the great theme of the book. People are ragamuffins before the holy and loving God. We are often well-intentioned but weak, frequently wrong but sometimes right. It is GRACE that recovers us and gives us value, and it is God's grace shining here and there in this volume that makes it worth reading."
5,Intense Grace for the weak and weary,"This book is by far one of the best that I have read in regards to the teaching of the amazing Grace that God has given to us. Brannan Manning is funny, witty and direct. This book is filled with many stories to illustrate his points and is an enjoyment to read. I highly recommend this book to any Christian at any level in their relationship to Christ."
1,Be warned - get the original,"I was very disappointed when this book arrived and I learned that it only had 15% of the orginal text. Very edgy, for a target audience. But I strongly reccommend you get the full version of the book. It is wonderful."
4,Ragamuffin Gospel.,"I haven't read the entire book yet but what I have read is wonderful. If it's anything like Manning's ""Furious Love of God"", I know I will enjoy every word."
2,Excellent Spiritual Guidance,"This is a book that I have read through four (4) times and from Mr. Manning and his teachings in this book particularly, I learned that no matter what I do, how badly I screw up, what I look like, what bad lanquage I use, Abba, Daddy God loves me more deeply than I can fathom! Beautiful, deep, Love!"
3,Ragamuffin Gospel,"Brennan Manning's book Ragamuffin Gospel is refreshing and I am thankful to Waterbrook/Multnomah for the free copy to review.There were actually several parts of the book that lined up with the sermons I was preaching. It was a great reminder of God's grace and the unbiblical rules we have placed on ourselves. Manning believes and explains how much of Christianity has become rule-centered Pharasaical religion. His book preaches God's grace. It was a refreshing reminder. Though it may be a little too therapeutic, leave too many unneeded personal examples, and have a little different theology than me, I would still recommend it to others as a though-provoking read. I am sure that this book will continue to encourage many in the years and decades to come."
3,The Ragamuffin Gospel Visual Edition,"The content of the book was great. I was disappointed that when I ordered the book, the description of the product was not clear. I did not realize that the book was mainly pictures without much writing. Also the binding was so poor, the book fell apart when I was only half way through in reading it."
2,Disappointing,"Those who expect an answer to the questions volumes 1 and 2 have promised would be solved in vol. 3 may be disappointed. The whole book concentrates more and more on the war between the Marines and China, and nothing else. As readers we have been waiting for three books, and then we only get a few lines of information about the aliens/ancestors at the end. The Alpha Centauri plot in the middle of the novel ends abruptly and is never continued.The good action and story of vols. 1 and 2 has now been institutionalised and the fighting gets boring. It is not conceivable that the nations on Earth would behave like this in face of such an enormous discovery. Maybe this book is the preparation of volume four, money has frequently generated trilogies with more than 3 volumes. But if this is the case, we as readers expect more tension and more substance. This book is weak in comparison to the others."
2,SOOO disapointing...,"I loved the first two books in the Luna Marine Triology. Ian Douglas left so much to hope for with the end of the second book. Find out who the Hunters of the Dawn were, a final battle for supremacy in the galaxy. This had the potential for a really good story! Unfortunatly, it looks like Mr. Douglas wrote the book only to get it on the shelf. It barely tracks with the two previous books. A main personality from the first two stories is barely mentioned! The only excuse for this is if Mr. Douglas plans to write a fourth book. By what I read in Europa Strike, that is just what he plans to do. That or leave many readers SOOOOO disapointed."
5,Europa Strike,For pure escapism within the military Sci-fi genre the three trilogies by Ian Douglass are at the top of a very short list. Why I say short is because other authors fail to bring real physics (as we know them today) and weave them into the story line. Excellent work may he write many more!Lance
3,"21st century ""Space Marine"" battle story, with little character development","EUROPA STRIKE (2000) is the 3rd book in THE HERITAGE TRILOGY, and continues the story of ""Space Marines"" in space-based battles occurring in a future space-based war (2067) between the US and China - with much of the battle sequences taking place on the Jupiter moon Europa, which has 1/8th Earth's gravity, and is described to have a liquid ocean beneath ice - which plays significantly into the logistics of the Europa-based battle sequences.The space-based battles are believable and entertaining; however, character development is seriously lacking, and where any is attempted, it is done half-heartedly - I was never able to identify with any of the characters as ""heros"". Additionally, the book obviously couldn't predict the events of 9/11/2001 - and there a few anachronistic passages relating to this situation."
4,A fairly interesting scifi tale about war and aliens,"The three Heritage books are really just one long novel. It wouldn't make much sense to read any of them individually since none is a complete story. Anyhow, this was kinda two stories in one. A fairly interesting scifi tale about aliens visiting our solar system. And then (as a bonus) the other story is about a war with the UN and then later, China. Together they make for a pretty good story. I especially liked how Douglas explained the science behind the weapons and technology and described the underlying discovery in the 20th century. On the downside, I coulda used a little less marine comradery and a little more about the aliens."
4,Great Story... Sequel please!,"This is an excellent ""Near Future"" trilogy. The author does a nice job of wrapping up the series while setting us up for another series at the same time. This trilogy was well worth the read, and I plan to read it again. If you are a fan of military science fiction, Mr Douglas will not disappoint you."
5,The best on the market..,I love body shampoos and this is the very best.My wife really love this soft smell.And it last all day.
3,This Is Not the Soundtrack,"While this is a fine album, it is not the soundtrack of the TV show. On the show, Dave Brubeck played a breath-taking blues about twenty minutes into the program. Marcia Ball played an incredible solo piano and vocal of Red Beans. Duke Ellington was featured on tape playing a rousing CJam Blues with Mingus and Roach. These artists are on the CD, but NOT playing what we saw and heard. I bought the CD because of them and feel a little cheated. If they were to re-release this album with the original soundtrack numbers, it would be a major improvement."
4,"Blues, etc.","There's some great stuff on this CD: folks who like their piano blues straight-up will treasure tracks 1, 2, 13, 15, & 18; those who like a little vocals with their piano blues will favor tracks 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, & 20.Tracks 10, 11, & 19 are too jazzy for my taste and the screeching vocals on track 7 literally made my dog get up and leave the room. Track 3 is pleasant enough, but it's really a big band number and thus it sounds a bit out of place on this collection. Tracks 6 & 14 are played so fast that they're more irritating than anything else."
4,"Intricate sting operation, FRench style","Charming ""caper"" type film about a sting operation that has several plot twists to the very end. Very entertaining, a sort of French response to George Roy Hill's ""The Sting""."

4,Great introduction for a rookie!,I picked this one up a few summers ago since I didn't have much genuine fishing experience at all. This book helped me get up to speed on all facets of freshwater fishing and the knowledge I've gained through it has provided a great deal of enjoyment out on the water since then.
5,Great Toy!,He has got to be the cutest little toy I have seen in sometime. I am not a big Elmo fan and have tried to really get my daughter into other Sesame Street characters. My daughter is younger then the recommended age but she still enjoys watching and laughing with him.
2,It's not as much fun as the Elmo,"Well, I bought this one on sale because I love the blue Cookie Monster that's kind of similar to this one. But it's not as much fun as the Cookie monster. My son pretty much ignores it. I would recommend getting the Cookie monster instead."
1,"""Possessed"" Ernie","We have the Tickle Me Elmo and our 21 month old loves it, so my husband ordered Tickle Me Ernie thinking it'd make a great addition. Ack! Ernie scared the crap out of our son! Unlike Elmo, he doesn't have a cute little laugh and shake. Tickle Me Ernie is, for lack of a better word, possessed. He spins on the floor and shakes like he's having a seizure, then jumps back up, freaking the hell out of you. Perhaps this is just me. It looks like lots of other reviewers here love this thing. But my idea of fun (and my son's, apparently), is not epilepsy Ernie."
5,I love it but,I love this toy but some times it scares the hell out of me when it starts playing by it self while I am sleeping. Reminds me of Chuky but in a good way
4,nothing can be quite the same as Elmo!,"Kids liked Elmo the best!ERnie is cute, but just doesn't have the same contagious laugh!"
3,fun toy for a little while,"Any kid 1 and a half and up will break it in a matter of weeks.Eats batteries, and it takes 6 at a timeit has hard feet and not very cudily"
3,tickle me ernie,"this toy is pretty neat it, the only thing is that the robot sometimes does not start ot move or laugh untill you really push the tummy area. A little kid may not be able to activate the robot."
5,WOW,This is excellent kit and works as promised. I would recommend this to anyone trying to stop rusting in the dishwasher racks.
3,The sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk.,"This is a good overview of the sinking the Russian submarine Kursk and the general state of the Russian Navy. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, the defense establishment has received far less attention and resources than before. This contributed to the sinking of the sub.I was particularly interested in what motivated the claims of the Russian Navy that another submarine collided with the Kursk resulting in her loss. The facts are otherwise, but the political motivation to blame an external power was there. Incompetence by either personnel on the Peter the Great in shooting off a missle or in the torpedo technicians on the Kursk (not Navy personnel) led to this disaster. Old habits die hard in Russia, so someone else to blame was necessary. Burleson does a good job of writing about this in the book."
4,Good read,"Interesting to read a book written before advent of cell phones, and realize what police officers had to go through to do their jobs. This is the first in a series, and I intend to read more of the series. Bosch is a believable protagonists."
4,Pleasantly Good,"This book is a good read for those who loves to enojy humorous moments. I ejoyed it through the end, even though the last 50 pages or so wasn't necessary. It was a little trite like every other kind of novel, but interesting nonetheless. The heroine did become a little annyoing near the end, but I love her spirit, and as well as the hero's intelligents in admitting he loves her, and not stubboringly waiting till the very end of the novel to tell the heroine so."
1,20th century slang in 19th century?????,"It really annoys me to see words and turns of phrase that did not show up until the mid 1800s in AMERICA and are only now creeping into British speech. You really need to check these things. It gives the books a very inauthentic feel. Have you ever read Austen, Bronte sisters or Georgette Heyer? You should. Jeffery Farnol is a good source of authentic sounding English speech as well.If you can't find an editor who is familiar with the proper use of 19th century English, I would be happy to check your manuscripts beforehand. Your writing is otherwise excellent."
4,LOVE THIS STORY!!!,"This has been my all time favorite, not just in the series but of all of Julia Quinn's work! I definitely love the spunky heroine, Henry, and Dunford has always been a favorite as well.It is a slower plot than her usual and I still can't quite tell when the two actually fall for one another, but I enjoyed the story so much that I don't care.Overall, this is definitely an add for the collection! :)"
4,MINX,"Julia Quinn is a good writer and I've enjoyed so many of her books. I ordered quite a few through Amazon and was pleased with the promptness of getting them.I found the plot a little awkward. It was more like a Eliza Doolittle character -- from a masculine type heroine transformed into a lady. Enjoyable but contrived and predictable. Loved the hero, William Dunford.But I enjoy all romance books, even the ones that challenge my ability to believe the romance."
5,Nice trilogy,"I really enjoyed reading this trilogy by Julia Quinn, ""Splendid"", ""Dancing at Midnight"", and ""Minx"". Minx is particularly good since it continues the stories of Alex and Emma, and John and Bellein addition to giving us a love story for William Dunford who was our favorite best friend throughout the first two stories. I love how Ms. Quinn ties her books together, not only within a 3-part series such as these, but throughout all her writings. The Smith-Smythe sisters and their lack of musical ability continues to show up in Ms. Quinn's works and it lends a feeling of continuity. You feel as if that time in history and those characters really existed because they continue to show up in one another's stories."
3,Cornballish?...,"I really liked Henry, but I didn't care too much for Dunford; he was a little cornballish (yes I'm aware that isn't a word)...It was also very obvious this was one of her first works, but overall a pretty good read."
3,Not one of her best,"I've enjoyed any number of Julia Quinn's books, but this one was just ok. A good read with a happy resolution, as you'd expect in the genre, but I was furstrated by the fact that the heroine herself generated all the drama that made the second half of the book necessary. There was one particular manipulative act that made me hard to like her for the rest of the book and overall, she herself seemed to be the biggest obstacle to her own happiness. Unless you've read then all, I would reach for one of her other books instead- better payoff!"
5,Hilariously Funny,"I thought that this book was great , the male character had charm and a very humerous streak in him. The herione went through alot of trouble to get rid of him only to fall madly in love with him. This books was 5 stars all the way, but take my word and read it, it's very funny."
3,Okay..,I agree with the previous reviewer.. the conflict was unnecessary.. it seems contrived. Sometimes placing this 'conflicts' seem to belong in a Mills and Boons novel. PS I liked the hero but grew irritated with the heroine
2,What's All The Fuss About???,"I know this is one of Julia's earlier works, but this book is far from being the charming read that others claim it is. While ""Henry"" the heroine is likeable enough, sometimes she's just plain irritating. She has a way of prattling on and says the most random and insipid things at the most initimate moments, that it makes you want to scream! I know this is supposed to be a part of her charm, but it's mostly just annoying.Dunford the hero is--well, bland. We're told he's charming and a bit of a rake, but we never really see it, so he's not terribly convincing as a hero.I also agree with some of the other reviewers in that the book was about 50 pages too long. I didn't even read those last pages because the story naturally ended when he proposed to her.All in all, this is not a terrible read, but from what I understand, the author has better written and more enjoyable books to chose from."
4,Very Cute Book,"I got bored with some parts of it and found I could get easily distracted and put the book down and come back to it, which with her Bridgerton series I refused to put the book down until I was finshed. I found both characters charming and the story was fun but it was not Julia Quinn's best book."
1,WORST JULIA QUINN NOVEL EVER! (sorry for the dramatics),"I am so angry at Mrs. Quinn right now. Her books, especially the Bridgerton series, have always been fairly lighthearted and some of my favorite romance literature. Minx, however, was COMPLETELY RUINED for me because she had to throw in an elaborate ""big misunderstanding"" at the end. Not a little misunderstanding; her characters had to wallow for like two months because of it. It brought down the book irrevocably, and I've never felt so let down an author.EDIT: Heh, so as you can probably tell... I was pretty angry when I wrote this review. Basically, I was very frustrated because the major falling out between the protagonists was dragged out so extensively. It really ruined my enjoyment of the novel. It's one of the few books by Julia Quinn I would not recommend."
5,Minx,Julia Quinn is an exciting and riviting author. She has the ability to capture your interest in the first few pages and hold it until the end of every book.
5,This was my favorite,"I loved this book, Ill never forget the first time I read one of Julia Quinn's books, I looked at the back cover and saw that face of a little girl ...and thought I am getting very old, how can she write like my old favorites (Rosemary Rogers etc.), and having not read in over 10 years, I thought no way can this girl write...and she proved me wrong, in every one of her books...I LOVE her ... I fell in love with them all.. In addition, after reading every book she writes ...I look at that /sweet/smug smile of hers on the back cover and smile back at her ...and think...life is still good, I still get my romance ... and it is even better then before. Cant judge a book by its cover or um back cover that is. *wink*"
2,Not all that but informative,In my opinion I really liked how informed we were about each character and given a full view of how hard it is for Single Mother and their children. I just felt as though the way the book ended it left a lot of questions unanswered and unresolved. I felt as though this was not Omar Tyree's best work and I doubt it that I would recommend it as the best selection I have read all year.
3,Not Omar's best work,"As much as I usually enjoy Omar's books, this work proved lackluster in comparison to Flyy Girl, A Do Right Man, and Capital City. I had no feelings for the poorly developed characters. I see where Omar was coming from with the idea, but it read more as an essay than a novel. It seemed as if he was trying to be a Sunday School preacher. Walter and JD were terrible fathers who only wanted to get into their children's life to appease their own guilty conscience, not for love of their estranged sons. I also felt that they were too accepting of Brock, who did not need a narration in the novel. Overall, this wasn't a bad book, but it certainly was not his best effort."
4,Awsome,Denise is living my vision. Omar how could you have know what reality could be possible for an individual. I truly enjoyed this booked and it stated such an reality bite for me. Career wise Denise is living my vision and making it clearly plain for a sister who wants to help others. Thanks Omar for waking up a burning desire that I almost thought was unreal to see.
3,Left something to be desired.,"I found this book to be okay....not what I expected after reading Flyy Girl and Capital City. For me, the book didn't really get somewhat interesting until half way through. However, I could relate to the female character in the book. Regardless, Mr. Tyree, has good writing skills. Keep up the good work!"
3,It was okay,"I'm a single mom and I don't think Mr. Tyree hit the marker with me, there is alot more to being a single mom than worrying about a man."
3,Good reading but could be better,"I was looking forward to reading this book because I enjoyed ""Flyy Girl"" and ""A Do Right Man"" however I must say that I was a bit disappointed. I felt that this book was more about single dads than single moms. It gave more of the point of view of Jimmy, Dennis and Walter than that of Denise. I also felt at times as if the book was too preachy and a bit self righteous, it also felt more like I was reading an essay than a novel. I could relate to each of the characters on one level or another but overall I thought parts of it was unrealistic. I am not trying to bash the writer because I know that he is a good writer, however I felt that this book did not fully show his talent. I look forward to his next novel."
3,"Good Story, but too Preachy Down the Stretch","Single Mom was my first exposure to the work of Omar Tyree. The basic storyline revolves around the title character, the two fathers of her two sons, her new romantic interest, and various friends and family. This is a relationship book, and Tyree does a good job with dialogues and evolving character development. I especially appreciated the fact that aside from the trifling younger sister, all the characters had redeeming traits and weakenesses. On the other hand, the constant harping on ""community"" and schoolwork, while admirable, came off as heavy handed overkill by story's end. In the conclusion, Tyree states he wants this book to be a ""spark plug"" to initiate a discussion of single parenthood. Seems a bit of reach. In all, a pleasant enough book--but not likely to effect social change."
5,To be read by all ladies who came up durning the 80's. Great,Flyy Girl was so good I wanted to read it again the author paitns a great picture of the story that he tells. This book brought back so many memories of the 80's. I look forward to other books from this author!!
2,Unsatisfied and still hungrey,"Single Mom started off pretty good and exciting. That was one of the reasons for purchasing the book...Sad to say that was the downfall. The farther I went, the worse it got. I have read almost all of Omar's books and I can honestly say that this is the worse one. I hope that we can look forward to something alot better in the future...Meaning beginning to end. Not beginning to page 27. Thanks for your time.... Unsatisfied and still hungrey."
2,Disapointing,"There was nothing in this book that kept me reading it. I have read 2 other books since starting this one. I'd read 2 chapters, then pick up another more interesting book. I finally finished it, and it left me cold. I didn't care for it much at all! Sorry Omar!"
1,I'm Sorry,"Now ya'll i try not to down my favorite black authors, but this book did not catch me totally. When I read a book I usually can't put it down but this book I put it down alot. The storyline with each one of the characters and their private lives could have been more in depth and the book could have had a little more action. To be totally honest his books have not really caught my attention since ""Flyy Girl"" came out. I was mad about ""Do right Man"", and I am glad to say that Do right man and Single Mom were two books that I did not pay for, a friend loaned them to me. Sorry about the bad review Omar."
4,Good book,"I liked that this book was told from several perspectives. I'm not a single mom, nor do I have any children, and actually, had my book club not selected this book, I probably would have never read it. Nevertheless, it was a good read for the book club and for the discussion we had regarding the ""rights"" of fathers who do not have custody of their children."
3,Okay Read,"The book is okay. I have read other novels by Omar Tyree that were a little more exciting than this one. I was hoping for a few twists and turns. It seems like some of the characters in the book kept dwelling on their pasts rather than looking towards their futures. Also the ""woulda, coulda, shoulda"" has been repeated too many times in this story which made it kind of boring."
3,It was okay,"This book was okay. Everything that happened in the beginning of the novel, ended up the same way. I kinda hope there would be some type of change of events. I still like it though because I was still interested."
4,single mom,This book was truely a good book for all the single mothers out there struggling to keep there kids together without the father or fathers around.Eventhough Iam not a mother i know that my mother struggled herself just to make her kids successful so this book is for all the strong women out there trying to do the right thing.
2,Single Mom,"First of all I am just like Denise, only I have one child and I too am a professional woman. I thought that this book was lacking. I couldn't finish this one. I have read all of his books this is the only one that I just plain didn't like. I will continue to buy his books. better luck next time."
1,Single Mom Waste of time!!,"I usually can finish a book in a week but it has taken me 3 months to get through this one. Its is soooo boring. Nothing ever happens in this book. When I read the title I thought that there would be a few struggles like the ones I have dealt with being a single mom. Her life is perfect: Good job, good money, good boyfriend and good baby daddys. No turning point & no baby momma drama at all in this book whatsoever!! Nothing ever happend. Ever time I turned the page I got more and more aggravated. I can't believe this book was ever put out there for us to purchase. I don't enjoy bashing people but how the heck was this book published??? I don't get it......Boring Boring Boring"
3,Single Mom Was Cool,I thought Single Mom did a good job of hearing all the sides of the story. It gave you an ideal of how everybody felt. It wasn't better than Flyy Girl but this book was good. Its something that is good to read.
4,2 Thumbs Up!,"This was a good book, it kept me reading and reading. This is the 3rd book I read by Omar Tyree, and I really have enjoyed all three of them: Flyy Girl, For The Love of Money, and Single Mom. Now I am about to read A Do Right Man."
2,Sadly Dissapointed,"I was greatly dissapointed while reading this book. Any book that i put my hands on and is good i can finish it in one sitting. So for this book it took a MONTH. I'm not sure what omar tyree was thinking when he wasted all the trees that he used to print his boring story on paper, but i can tell you that it wasn't a good choice. I'm not sure if he meant for the book to move so slowly, or if it was by mistake. I guess only single mothers can relate to this dissapointment, but i sure do know that i couldn't."
4,Much love and Praise,"I love the book. It was recommended to me by a friend of mine who read ""Fly Girl"". I went to the library to check THAT book out, but ended up with ""single Mom"". I have no regrets. I love the fact that the book is so real. I like how it was written from every point of view, giving you a better understanding of the situation. Im on my way to the bookstore right now. and, I'll be looking for more books to come. . . . . ."
4,A decent book,"I just finished reading this book today on my lunch break and it was alright. I like how the fathers decide to get involved in their sons lives after so many years of not getting be there. I like how the story was told from 4 different characters point of view and a different variety of characters were also involve. This story can be a bit preachy at times with that ""I'm a strong black woman..."" hoopla and Denise and Cameilla can be bit of two-goody two shoes at times but I guess they had their personal reasons. This story shows that there are a few good fathers out there that are not aren't involved with the mother and that it's never too late to start over. The end leaves you hanging a bit though because they never got to the part were Denise and Brock get married but a the same time I guess Denise wouldn't be ""Single Mom"" which is what title states. END."
4,Thick 'n Stiff,"This sleeve offers acceptable protection, an heat-vent aperature, and a clear window to remind you what computer you put in it. I do find it heavier, bulkier, and stiffer than other incases I have experienced."
4,dig the window,"I've had one of these for a couple years now and it's held up beautifully. I beat the crap out of it and it might not be quite as cushiony-soft as it was the day that it arrived upon my doorstep, but it still cradles my precious just right."
3,Not exactly as advertised.,"I wanted a bookcase in the 16 to 18 inch width range, but could not find any that I liked so I settled for this one advertised as 14 inches in width. Unfortunately once I got them assembled (I bought two) I found they were only 12 inches wide with 10 inches of space for books. On the positive side they are good looking, well built bookcases and they arrived much sooner than the estimated date."
5,a gem,"For a book first published in 1951, I am surprised this is a first ""customer review""! Chase is an uncommonly pithy observer and reporter, well grounded in the letters and poems, of a thing as elusive as the inner life of this greatest, and most enigmatic, of poets.I am a bit surprised at the [current] $86 price for a ""new"" copy, and happy for a ""Good"" used one for under $7, as it is worthy of being part of the personal library of any Dickinson fan, as I become ever more avidly as I peer into the mysteries. This biography rewards reading, and re-reading... I am buying the $7 book (having spent almost 20x that recently for a facsimile of her Herbarium--as gift to a friend.)"
3,Not one of the best.,"More like 3 1/2 stars, really.This book was a real disappointment to me. It is most definitely not one of the good Discworld ones; in fact, it's the worst I have read. I love the Discworld series, and have read a fair amount of them.This is about Death. To put it bluntly; he loses his job and becomes a reaper man.Meanwhile, with no one to take all the souls away, things are a mess in Ankh-Morpork. Furniture is flying around (more like a flying squirrel flies, really), undead are not that rare, and a stash of little glass globe-things are appearing - the kind that you shake with the snow and they have the city of Ankh-Morpork as the figure inside.And then, carts start appearing. Useful; until they run away with your things in them.While there are some of the funny elements that make the Discworld series so fun, it lacks somewhat in that area and the story area. Instead, I recommend reading Sourcery, Hogfather, the Color of Magic, and Interesting Times."
5,A master at work,This is my favourite Pratchett. This book contains one of the most amazing and beautiful passages I have ever read.Before DEATH does battle he must sharpen his scythe....I'm not going to describe it. I can't do justice to it.Read Reaper Man. You deserve it.
5,Another satirical success,"Continuing his successful Discworld series, Terry Pratchett's ""Reaper Man"" is yet another example of why the author is so widely loved. The premise of ""Reaper Man"" is that Death himself learns he is about to die, and decides to go on vacation and experience life for his remaining days. This complicates things for the living, especially those who were supposed to die, such as the oldest wizard, Windle Poons. The resulting story is funny and well-crafted, and Pratchett demonstrates again an amazing talent for creating interesting characters. The novel moves along smoothly and is consistently witty and clever. Though ""Reaper Man"" becomes slightly more confusing and harder to grasp towards the end, the writing is still fraught with humor and Pratchett uses his combination of fantasy and satire with near perfect results. Fans of the series will thoroughly enjoy this addition, and shouldn't be surprised if they finish with their cheeks sore from laughter."
4,Cutting-edge Comedy,"Reaper Man was an excellently written novel. Pratchett's combination of humor, drama, and a serious, intimately written plot make for easy reading. Truly, this novel was more a work of art than just a few pages, words and a binding."
4,Everything We've Come to Expect,"This is another strong work showcasing the zany characters and situations from discworld. There are tons of things to be introduced to: new societies, new characters, new info on the nature of discworld, new Gods, new locals, new almost everything. In all honesty, it's a bit too much new. There are more things going on in this book than normal(and that's saying something for a Terry Pratchett novel), which makes it hard to keep up with multiple story arcs, esoteric descriptions of events, and all the new characters.It was more loosely written; usually, everything at the end is tied up in a nice little package with all story elements coming together in a harmonious ending. This novel had way too many loose ends floating around to reach that level. This novel still reaches an amazing level of humor though with several sections being exquisite laugh-out-loud moments. I would still recommend it, even though it might not be the most tightly spun Pratchett novel I've read."
5,Great!,"I'm glad T.P wrote a book about Death as he pops up in all the other books but before 'Reaper Man' I didn't see a lot of him (with the exception of 'Mort') Still, it's a great book and it'll keep you laughing!"
5,Death and comedy go together like chocolate & peanut butter!,"Terry Pratchett shows once again that even the most serious of subjects is no match for the silliness that is discworld! He cleverly walks the fine lines of literature, embracing humor without falling into stupidity; exploring life and death without falling into dull preachiness. What sets Pratchett's writings apart from that of others in the field of fiction today is his balancing act; Every story has a serious plot, it's just the characters and setting that are ridiculous. What sets ""Reaper Man"" apart is the interesting look at ourselves that Pratchett provides, both through the eyes of Death and, in some cases, Windle Poons. Both come to realize in the end what really is important in life. Finally, ""Reaper Man"" finally allows Death to become a good guy, something that was denied him in the early discworld novels and, to some extent, in ""Mort"". As this novel shows, Death has indeed become quite a character, in more ways than one!"
4,Another Pratchett,"Interesting reading in the unique style of Terry Pratchett. If you haven't tried him, you should...Terry's books have great insight into humans and their interactions in an entertaining and off beat approach."
3,"As Usual, Entertaining","Reaper Man is typically Terry Pratchett: a skewed look at our world through the lens of his imaginary Discworld. This time his protagonist is Death, who plays hooky from his normal job of sending people into the afterlife to play human. Which raises the question: if nobody really goes into the afterlife, what happens with all the people (and other forms of life) that should be dying? Pratchett has a lot of fun with this idea. As always, his wit had me laughing out loud on occasion. This is not a great book and he has written better, but what the heck, it's Discworld, and if you're a fan of the series (I am), then you'll enjoy it."
3,It's ok,"This is the first book by Pratchett I have read. I have to say it doesn't live up to the hype. I liked the arc involving Death. His version of Death isn't particularly creative but it was well done. The other arc involving the snow globes, however, wasn't particularly funny or witty - it was simply dumb. I was unmoved and not very entertained by it. Thus I rate this book as pretty average. You can find better examples of this sort of writing in Piers Anthony's 'Xanth' series."
5,Lillte Joes,My mother grew up with this and I enjoyed it as much as she did when she was a teenager.
3,confused by picture...,"I just recieved this item in the mail today. I was confused by the picture (ordering it on my droid) upon my ordering. It looked to be a mask with the helmet to me. However after ordering it on my phone & looking at it on my computer. I noticed it's not the full mask w/ helmet. Overall it's a good mask though! It looks good,it's a decent size for either a kid or adult to wear. And for the price it's worth it.You can breathe fine in it.There are string s in the back with velcro. I have a kinda small head, so I just tied it. I will say you may have some trouble seeing through it at night,. Or in a dark part of your house. I plan to get a mask w/ helmet. But this is one my son and I can get crazy with, and not be that mad if it accidentally get's wear and tear. If you want a replica, this is not it. However, it's a cool mask to play around with."
3,Great mask...great price.,"Love this mask. Inexpensive costume when paired with a cheap black cape. Only problem is the plastic over the eyes is somewhat fuzzy causing some vision issues. I won't be wearing this for long stretches so I'm ok with it. Just be aware that vision is somewhat hindered, hence 3 stars. Still a keeper for me!"
3,Herrenvolk/Home was...,"It's interesting to note that as gross as Home was, everyone remembers it. The best part was the deleted scene with Mulder and Scully squeezed in a closet and she asks him if it was his flashlight she felt. Mulder is funny saying he's turned on pushing pigs. As for Scully and her ""Babe"" comments, I didn't see Babe and therefore can't relate.As for Herrenvolk, I think that was a very pivotal episode in trying to keep account of all the aliens and their purpose. We see the governments involvement and the bounty hunters actions (which for the longest time confused me and I'm still not too sure especially after his/their involvment with the torture of Mulder in the eigth season...but I digress.) I don't think these two episodes should stand alone unless you're having horror night at your house but as a vehicle to show the contrast in the X-Files universe, they're right on the nose (or back of the neck.)"
4,You can go HOME again!,"The rumor is HOME was so contraversial the FOX network won't air it again. I don't know which part was more frightening; the Peacock brothers traveling to their next victim's house while Johnny Mathis's ""Wonderful, Wonderful"" plays on the car radio, or Mulder and Scully considering parenthood with each other, sort of."
1,Not a good product at all very disappointed,"I got this cap for my volkswagen cabriolet. Within two weeks it rusted and pitted.It is assembled in Mexico. I called Stant and they were very nice and sent me a replacement. Within four months the replacement broke and does not work any more.Bad product, bad design, bad quality. I am afraid to buy another because I fear the lock will break and I will not be able to put gas in my car.Do yourself a favor and get the OEM gas cap for your vehicle instead of this pathetic product."
5,WONDERFUL!,"I have read over and over E. Kenyon's book "" The Wonderful Name of Jesus"" and to me this book is a companion. I know Mr. Hagin now dwells with Mr. Kenyon in the presence of the Lord, but thank God that both have left us with some wonderful teaching books on our use and authority in the Name of Jesus.Mr. Hagin clearly explains how important it is for believers to correctly use Jesus Name as they go about their Christian walk.I found this book easy tounderstand, Biblically sound and very useful. I recommend it! Thank you Rev. Hagin for leaving us words that are life changing!"
5,Simple Yet Profund Truths,"Kenneth Hagin has never written a bad book. This is one of his best in a long string of exceptional books about the Bible and Christianity.This book focuses on the power in the name of Jesus and how Christians should use it. That sound simple but it's a truth overlooked by most Christians for centuries. The name, spoken in faith, is a powerful weapon against sickness, disease, oppression and fear.Hagin, like the apostle Paul, received most of his knowledge of the Bible from revelation. He also has written how Jesus appeared to him five times in his ministry. If that seems strange, it isn't.Hagin was one of the greatest prophets and teachers in the history of the Body of Christ and this book was one of his best."
5,A must for every Home Library!,"I was in search of a keepsake to leave to my children as a legacy for my grandchildren. I ordered one of these books for each of my children and gave it as an extra Christmas gift with instructions to have each of my grandchildren read it when they graduate from high school and at any other time in their life that they need to have their ""faith"" reinforced.This is now a classic Heirloom in our family and will be passed from generation to generation. Many thanks to the Hagin family for making these books available thru Amazon."
5,MUST READ!!!,"If you are wanting an in-depth and understandable teaching of the wonderful name of Jesus and how it applies to you, than this book is for you! If already love and understand His wonderful name, than this is the book for you! I couldn't stop reading it once I started! Kenneth E. Hagin's personal experiences and revelations are amazing and spirit stirring. If you have doubts or un-belief about Jesus and who you are in Him or who He is in you, after reading this book your mind won't be able to question it. I was so personally stirred up that it brought me even closer in relationship with the power and authority that I have been given in this precious name. The life that I now live does not and will not be controlled by the principalities, powers, and darkness of this world, but by the truth, power, and knowledge in/of the name of Jesus!"
2,Flimsy metal,"I bought these because the cheap plastic ones that came with my bike broke. I thought these would be better because they are metal, but the cages bend easily, and now have broken, not lasting more than a few months."
1,Crappy product,I bought these off a local bike shop in a pinch. I rode with them one day and had to take them off and bend them back into shape. They're probably good if you're not riding very hard.
4,Gonna make you sweat!!!,"I was very pleased with this video. It is a very good overall workout, pretty intense cardio as you progress. The instructor is a karate champion so almost all of the moves are karate based. There are a lot of self defense techniques too incorporated in the workout. He provides plenty of motivation and fully explains moves and stances. The more you use this video the stronger you will feel. The music is not that great though and the rotating set can be a little annoying but apart from that its a great energising video."
2,Look elsewhere for kickboxing!,Someone gave me this video and I popped it in the VCR once and passed it along. This was so boring and the intensity was very low. You could also tell that there wasn't very much money put into this video. If you are looking for kickboxing I recommend Kathy Smith or Aaron Lankfords Power Kicks. Advanced kickboxers I recommend Dawei Kickboxing. You are better off passing on this one.
1,Don't buy this. Stopped working after 4 months.,I bought this clock because I liked the look of it. The quality was what I expected for a clock of this price. It stopped working after 4 or 5 months. I thought the battery was just dead but it was broken.
2,Don't know.,"Nice item, good price, did not last AT ALL. It fell apart less than 6 months after I purchased it."
1,suprise!,"The face on the one I received was different than the one advertised. Also, the hands had fallen off by the time it arrived."
2,"Pretty, relatively quiet, but alarm didn't work.","The alarm function did not work when I received it. It is a nice looking clock, but feels rather flimsy."
2,Just a pretty face.,"I love the look of this clock. I wish it worked well. I have owned three, and all have the same issue. One little rattle or bump and it will stop, or not alarm correctly. So if you never touch it, (good luck with that) or check it constantly to make sure it is functioning, you will love it as I have--with reservations. I am shopping for a clock I can count on."
2,Not the Same as in the Picture,"I really liked the looks of the clock, the numbers, sort of nostalgic, but when I got the clock, it is not the same. It's boring, like a hundred other clocks. I have not used it yet, and when --and if I do before returning it, I'll be able to judge its performance. (See additional photo.)"
1,Unreliable - - - battery is easily dislodged,"The universal standard for a clock is reliability. The single AA battery is easily dislodged, stopping the clock. Although I like the fact that it's analog with a retro style, it is poorly engineered and shoddily manufactured. Additionally, it took over six weeks for delivery."
1,didn't work from the start!,"Hi everybody,Though I like the looks of this alarm clock (still do), it hasn't worked reliably from the start. I kept putting in new (brand name) batteries, but that doesn't help. The clock keeps stopping, e.g., when the clock gets moved slightly (picked up to operate the light, for example). Obviously, I end up not using it because I don't feel like I can rely on it - kind of the opposite what you need in an alarm clock! I'd like to return it, but I won't because of the hassle... so, at least I want to warn potential buyers that this was NOT a good purchase! In fact, a waste of money. I strongly recommend *not* to buy this alarm clock."
1,Broke almost immediately,"I was so pleased by the appearance of the clock when it first arrived. But within the first 24 hours, the sweep second-hand had broken off, and within 48 hours it no longer worked at all. I tried playing around with the battery placement after reading others reviews, but I got nothing. It LOOKS great, but it is very shoddily made. I'd return it but I threw out the packaging. I would not purchase it again."
4,Good Little Alarm Clock,"Small size takes up little space. The night light is not a back light, but a small light on the side of the face of the clock. Its escalating alarm volume works well. Good deco face."
2,Not the best,"Clock is pretty cheaply made. Front looks fine, but back is cheap plastic. Plan to put a new AA battery in if you forget to turn the alarm clock at 6:00 am and it rings at 6:00 pm. I have never had an alarm clock that went through batteries like this (I am on my third AA).Looks cool, wish it made better."
1,"cute, just don't use it to tell time","We love the look of this clock, but it will simply stop running without warning. Not slowly loose time. Stop.Got it 3 weeks ago and have put at least 4 different batteries in it thinking they were dead. Batteries are all fine. They power other items.Something is wrong inside. Battery fits tight so it must be beyond where the battery goes."
1,"Time Flies, This Clock Crashes","Behold the World's Worst Timepiece. If you are like me, you are probably searching for a cute, inexpensive but fairly reliable clock. You are endeavoring to disregard the negative reviews and pin your hopes on the positive. Don't kid yourself, and don't buy this clock.As soon as I extracted the timepiece from it's box, I knew something was terribly wrong. It was disturbingly light, even with the battery in. The backlight consisted of one microscopic bulb located at 3. The body was loose, flimsy, and rattled when jarred.The battery being installed, the second hand ticked erratically for less than a minute, then stalled, alternating between two positions. I re-wound the clock, adjusted the battery, tapped, and pleaded to no avail. I earnestly believe it is incapable of working properly.In short, run. This clock certainly won't."
3,Tiny clock!,"This clock is tiny!!! I know I should have looked at the dimensions before I ordered it, but I assumed it was maybe 5 or 6 inches across--not the case! It's cute for its small size and is loud enough to wake me up in the morning. It's pretty hard to set it to the exact minute that you want to wake up. You move a dial to the time that you want the alarm to go off. For example, if you wanted to wake up at 7:30 you would have to put the dial exactly between the 7 and the 8. I wake up on the hour so its fine for that, but overall a kind of silly design."
2,Crooked face but I'm keeping it.,"I needed a small cute looking clock in brushed nickel for our bathroom. This is the best I could find. The metal of the clock is nice, and looks substantial. The face of the clock is pretty. Unfortunately, the face is crooked, turned just a little bit (like the equivalent of a minute or two) to in the clockwise direction. This is annoying as it makes an otherwise nice clock look cheap. Still and all, I decided to deal with it and keep it because I like it overall. I have not used it as an alarm clock so I can not comment on that."
2,NOT as seen in picture!!,"The first photo that was listed for this item was NOT what I received. The subsequent pictures (which I had assumed were customer uploads of ""similar"" clocks) were of the product actually received. The price is fair for a small alarm clock but it should be noted it's not retro like the photo suggests. The outer design (top button and feet) are the same but the face looks entirely different and far more modern that what I had expected."
1,didn't work from the start,arrived in the box broken. alarm doesn't go off and the second hand skips back a second every minute or two causing it to be off by hours within a single day. I will be returning this item.
2,Looks great but doesnt work,"Love how this clock looks. But it doesn't keep time...every week or so its behind twenty minutes so I would not use it for alarm purposes. I'm considering rebuying another one hoping that one will keep time because I'm attached to how it looks in my little girls nursery. And yes, I've changed the batteries many times to no avail."
1,Too small,"I read the reviews, but trusted the description. Mistake. The product specs are incorrect. This clock is so small, it is the size of a travel alarm clock. The clock part, minus the button on top and the legs is about 2 inches, at most 2 1/2 inches. Not made well, mostly cheap, fragile plastic. It is difficult to get the battery in so that it will work, I was afraid I was going to break the casing and door. Not worth the money."
3,nice clock,"I ordered this clock for my ten year old daughter. When this first clock came, it didn't work at all. I returned it to Amazon, no problem, and they sent a replacement, which worked fine. It is perhaps a bit less sturdy than I might like, but it has a nightlight, is easy to set, keeps time well, and the alarm is loud. It's perfectly fine for a child."
3,jaunty little timepiece,"Has the polished bronze look of certain coffin handles. The only thing I don't like about this nifty little clock is that if you balance it on a pair of paperbacks with glossy covers and place it on your night table, you can hear it ticking. Also, the feature where you press a little button on top and illuminate the dial in the middle of the night, the little flash of light that appears is kind of like the blast of light that occurs in ""Wicked"" when the green witch disappears from the page."
4,My little alarm clock,"I don't need an alarm clock that will wake the dead and this one is just what I needed. It's not too loud and not too soft on my ears. It's easy to set the time and the alarm and it doesn't take up too much space on my night stand. I like the fact that I don't have to deal with wires and power outages. Some people may like a large clock, but not me."
1,Dissappointed,They show 2 different pictures online. I did not get the clock I thought I was getting. I thought the back light up.
3,Not As Pictured,Chose this clock because the 40s style and deco numerals fit decor of my wife's boudoir. No joy! Plain old arabic numerals and slightly chintzy construction. Lop about five bucks off the price and this would be an OK deal.
3,Clock Face is not the same as picture!,"Two things to note. 1st, the clock face is not the same as the picture. While what's on the clock is not horrible, I like the original face (the one on the picture) much better. Second, the clock is not made by Timex as shown. It's made by Geneva Clock Company in China.So far it works okay, but I just received it."
2,Little clock,Clock is soooooooo teeny tiny! It slips off my nightstand when I try to turn it off and I have knocked it on the floor more than one time. it would be really cute for decoration only...
3,Goos for price,"Good for price, but pretty cheaply-looking alarm clock. Still trying to figure ot whether it's working well or not. Good feature is that it doesn't scratch furniture."
1,Clock will only run 5 minutes before hands get stuck,"Clock is cute, but doesn't work. I kept trying new batteries thinking maybe the batteries were the problem, but no, it is the clock. It will only run 5 minutes before it gets stuck and the hands stop advancing. It I pull the battery out and put it back in, and advance the hands manually, it starts running again, but then gets stuck again after a couple of minutes."
1,Eternally 8:32...,"I needed a small clock for my bathroom so I could keep track of the time in the morning while I put my makeup on. And this nice looking little clock was perfectly fine for about 3 months. Then I noticed that I always happened to look at the clock when it was 8:32. I thought that was a pretty funny coincidence until I realized that the clock was just stuck at 8:32. You can see that it's trying - the second hand attempts to keep ticking, but something is holding it back...fear? Anxiety? Well, whatever the reason, this little clock just won't get going. And apparently I can't return it. Don't buy it. Save yourself the aggravation and the possibility of being extremely late for work."
5,Nice clock!,"I'm very happy with this clock, it has a clean, modern look, is easy to see and read, and the price was definitely very reasonable."
5,Bedside Table Clock,It's a used one but you would never know it. It came in perfect condition. It's just what I needed for my night stand & just the style I was looking for. Can't beat the price of $2.99 plus shipping. I am very happy with it.
3,Good for extreme fans of the show.,"This is an interesting concept for a book, and if you are a huge Grey's Anatomy fanatic I'm sure you'll like it. But it's a little redundant because the two halves cover essentially the same things, just from different perspecitive. And if you've *just* rewatched Grey's as I had before reading it, it might not be that entertaining either... of course, conversly, if you haven't seen Grey's in a while, a lot of the little jokes in the book might not make sense. I think it honestly works best as the website/blog that they have it running as now, where you can read the thoughts of 'Joe' and 'Debbie' in a more current format as you watch the show.But by all means buy the book if you love Grey's as I do, because I did enjoy it."
5,Great Show/Great Book,The book give readers a little background of what happens happens in the characters lives while the camaras are not rolling. Provides a little more bio on each character as well.
3,Not up to the show's standards,"The book is good for what it is, but is nowhere near as high a quality as the show. I was rather disappointed by this book."
3,"Nice, but mine came in Spanish",The chart looked just as displayed except all of the text was in Spanish... I didn't bother to return it since all the data was accurate and the planets' names were obvious.
4,"No Exit - Compelling, Ennui-laden Realism","I shied away from this at first because of the ""controversy,"" but found it just too true to life; a bit brutal, artfully filmed, plaintive, sad and strangely uplifting at the end.It felt large in scale by examining the enormous confusion and pain of a very young gayish teenager. Yet it also felt intimate, in the way Long Island communities are clannish, somewhat corrupt, and duplicitous.While exploring controversial issues of youth sexuality, it wasn't done in a tawdry way. Less provocative than Larry Clark's KIDS, but more cohesively structured and less seemingly exploitative."
4,unflinching look at pedophillia,This movie looks at the dangers facing young boys and girls who seperate themselves from adults in a way I havn't seen in any other movie.
5,All I can say is WOW,"The teen actors, esp. the lead, stunned me with their performances. I was surprised to see a bigger name in this movie, and surprised at his role as well. It touches on some sensitive topics without being judgmental. You're left to decide what you think and how you feel. The ending was an absolute shocker. I also have to tip my hat at the shaving scene. No one wonder it won awards. It deserved every one it got."
4,FROM AN INSIDE LOOK!,"Well when it comes to Long Island, this movie L.I.E and the actors i only want to voice what i have to say. 1 above all this IS a good movie BUT: being from long island this puts a bad name on my home, as in pedophilia and people may think all of Long Island is full of suburban spoiled kids, well its not... (or pedos as well), 2 Billy Kay, the actor that plays Gary i went to middle and high school with back in Huntington NY, his talents really come out in this movie thares been rumors that hes gay, let me clear this all by saying HE IS NOT! totally str8. finnally just realize that this is a great movie, just dont let it portray the wrong way!"
3,"Good, but a bit fuzzy","I like both the boy's and the older man's actings, although some points were left unexplained. On purpose. Or maybe I am too slow. And the ending , of course, was already expected. I confess I'd gotten my hopes up too high, but it was a good movie anyway."
2,not Unrated,"This is one of my favorite movies, very well acted, the directors other movie 12 and Holding is also excellent,I was looking forward to viewing edited moments but there are none, I advise buying new copy R rating"
4,Surprisingly good I command you to watch it,"OK to say the least, this movie isn't for everyone. On my part i thought i would've been shocked but really i wasn't that shocked at all in fact there wasn't that much provocative scenes there was just minor, but my opinion doesn't really count seeing as i have seen a lot more provocative movies than this. but surprisingly i enjoyed it there really wasn't too much deep and wrist-slitting scenes. it seemed short and pg rated i must've gotten a pg copy but the ending was good enough i also thought the boy how played howie the protagonist and messed up kid in the movie, to be hot and cute in that stagatorry rape kind of way."
3,Screwed Up,"They marketed this film as a gay film. This movie is not about homosexuality. If your looking for a gay film. Dont watch L.I.E. . If your looking for a movie to knock the wind out of you, watch it. Yes, i liked L.I.E. its a good movie and the acting was amazing but for the most part its hard to take. Its a movie about a petaphile named Big John who collects little boys. He scedules appointments with them and files them by a collection of poloroids (not esplicit ones, pretty much head shots). The funny thing is, he has them thinking theres nothing wrong with this. He finds young Howie when Howie steals his gun in a break in. Then he begins a relationship with howie by howie coming to his house on a regular basis. Twisted movie.. it made me a bit nauscious, but as i said, the acting and characters were great.. its worth seeing.."
1,Emotionally Disturbing,"I found this movie seriously emotionally disturbing and upsetting. Whici is why for me the rating is so low. I did not deal with it well. But trying to detachmyself form the emotional asspect of it. It was an interesting perspective that we don't often see. I think it was effectively filmed and the dialog was well written. It took a lot of courage to make this film. If you find yourself very disturbed by this type of subject matter as I am, I don't recommend it, you'll be sorry you went. But otherwise I'd definitly say its worth a viewing."
1,This movie is a little too disturbing for me!,"L.I.E is a coming of age movie that deals with a young teen trying to discover his sexuality. The first part of his sexual discovery is innocent. Flirting with his best friend, masturbating, and constantly thinking about boys. The second part of this sexual discovery is where the movie isnt fun anymore. An old man preys on the young teen and an initially good movie becomes a sick and disturbing movie. This movie actually becomes very hard to watch as u witness an old man preying upon a young teen. The old man is obviously a pedephile and all of the reviewers who claims that this guy is not a pedephile are obviously sick themselves. so be warned, this movie is very sick especially in a time around the world where sick adults constantly abuse and molest children."
5,very moving,"I just saw this film, after hearing a great deal about it. I must say that all the controversy that has surrounded this movie is completely unwarrented. This was a beautiful, heart-breakingly done coming-of-age story. The pedophilia angle is merely one aspect of a very multi-faceted film. The acting was uniformly excellent, and the direction and cinematography were superb. Along with Mulholland Drive and Donnie Darko, one of the finest films of 2001. I suppose it is necessary to say that this film might be disturbing to some viewers, but art is not made to escape to. Nor is life, for that matter."
5,L.I.E,"Up to now, I have never submitted a review. But this movie was so great that I felt compelled.The story by itself was incredibly written. I was enlightened to find that it was far more in depth...and surprising...than I had expected. Not wanting to give away important details, I can say that I was impressed with the fact that ""Big John"" did not take sexual advantage of Howie as I expected, but actually showed true feelings for this boy. It showed how pedophiles usually take advantage of boys for their own gratification, but that if the pedophile truely cares about the boy...sex is not involved.Anyway...I felt it was a remarkable movie with excellent acting!! Especially from Dano."
3,A sordid tale,"The L.I.E., or Long Island Expressway, becomes the metaphor of a boy's dangerous journey through worlds marred by burgulary, an automobile accident, and just about everything else that shouldn't happen to a child. Paul Franklin Dano gives a realistic and understated performance as Howie, a fifteen-year-old who recently lost his mother to the L.I.E. and may soon lose his father to prison. To make matters worse, one of Howie's friends has become involved with a man who may be a child molester. Brian Cox (Manhunter, The Bourne Identity) gives a creepy performance as the possible pedophile-a performance made even more creepy by the fact that he seems so human, concerned, and likable.It's never completely clear whether Howie is actually gay, or just doing what he can to survive-which is certainly the case with some of the other teenage boys in the plot. Still, he is a fascinating character with a love for writing and books. His tenderness turns a sordid tale into a very touching one."
5,This book was formerly titled _The Edison Trait_,"We have been searching for _The Edison Trait_ online today since the copy we are using is due back at the library. We found it online at around $50 a copy to buy it used! Fortunately we discovered that it has been retitled and is now sold as _Dreamers, Discoverers and Dynamos : How to Help the Child Who Is Bright, Bored and Having Problems in School_.My wife has kept the library copy until it is overdue and has a hold on it. This is the most excited I have seen her about a book since we were married. She has found some very practical tools to help us with our children."
4,Just the answer,This is a useful tool for teachers and parents who have a child who is bright not always engaged in learning wholeheartedly and you just can't pinpoint why. I have found it useful in my classroom to understand the thinking that some children are showing.
2,There are better ones...,"I've got this CD as well as the other Andras Farkas'. I think those who rate them with 5 stars don't know much about this kind of music because there are much better CDs than this. I have nothing against Andras Farkas he may be good violinist and his band is not really bad, but the fact that he's been living out of the source of the hungarian gypsy music is notable. Some tracks are good, but time to time is really [weird]. To those who are interested in this kind of music I recommend some Sandor Lakatos' albums (better Sandor Lakatos than his son Sandor Deki Lakatos), the album Hungarian Folk Music with various artists or Csardas - Hungarian gypsy music by Ferenc Santa (is the same type as this one but several levels up).I have more than 30 CDs of hungarian gypsy music and Andras Farkas' are one of the worst. So look around and find better."
5,Definitely Cool!,"This little girl is darling. Living in Florida, she is just perfect with her sunglasses! I have already had many compliments on her!"
5,Thanks. Waited years to get this DVD.,"Reggie is even better. From seeing the Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, when it was first aired on PBS, to now being able to watch any episode at any time is even better. This is some of the best of British comedy. Having the DVD in your own home to entertain yourself when you are looking for something unique and humorous trust Reggie to get your attention and make you forget your own daily grind."
3,"Politically corrected, so as not to offend the easily offended","I waited for decades, literally, to be able to see the complete series again ... only to find it had been bowdlerized. Shame on them.What is particularly galling about this censorship, is that the portions removed were making fun of the types of people who would flee a neighborhood just because somebody ""different"" moved in. Apparently, somebody who had no clue as to what was really going on, saw CJ in blackface and Tom with a turban, and decided that we would be scandalized by seeing it.Leftist censorship is no better than rightist."
1,The Greatest Television Series EVER: CENSORED!,"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin was simply the most inspired, profound, brilliantly written, and painfully truthful series ever to find its way onto television. This was something rare...TV for smart people! Chaucer would have loved this, and Shakespeare would have stolen plots from it.I happened to have been in London and saw Leonard Rossiter on stage in Loot a few nights before he died (during a performance.) He was a great actor, and in PERRIN was supported by a brilliant cast. The humor cut to the core of society's hypocrisy unlike any other show, before, or since, and was a weekly beacon of hope for the jaded cynics whose senses of values were daily buffeted by this maddening world.So what does the modern day Inquisition do? It's been PC sanitized for our protection.END CENSORSHIP! DON'T BUY THIS. DEMAND the original in its full anti-social glory."
4,I didn't get where I am today by rating things!,"Classic late 70's British comedy with the masterful Leonard Rossiter as Reggie. Pauline Yates is a joy to behold as Reggie's wife, and John Barron as Reggie's pompous boss then employee then boss. This is a must see."
3,"Still funny, but not that funny....","I remember watching this show on cable some 20 years ago. I thought that it was very funny at the time. Upon further review, yes it is funny. It is not as funny as I remembered it to be. If you know the series and the price is right, I recommend it. Otherwise, think twice. Maybe three times."
5,The Fall & Rise of Reginald Perrin: The Complete Series (New),"Having seen this series only once over 20 years ago, I still remembered it and was happy to find it on DVD at a better price than most BBC programs are sold for.I have watched some of the episodes and so far I find it as entertaining as I remembered. While some parts of it may have been edited for political correctness, I don't remember enough from my prior viewing to personally know for certain. I do know it's as quirky and interesting to me as I remember. It really made an impression on me all those years ago.If someone has seen it before, or is a fan of British comedy programs, I think it is a good set to own and enjoy watching. I know I am very pleased with it!"
4,First DVD was hilarious...,"I didn't get where I am today by writing DVD reviews, but here is my DVD review (after only seeing the first DVD). Loved it. Laughed every time I saw the hippo. The faces Leonard Rossiter makes before and after the daydreams are hilarious. And, once more, we have Geoffrey Palmer, who seems to be in at least one episode of every DVD set I buy. Great so far!! I give it 4 chair farts!!!"
5,Do yourself a favor and buy the new 5-disc set coming out,"Just ordered the 5-disc set (PAL, Region2) from Amazon.co.uk because it has bonus material offering every other scrap of Perrin, including a post Fall and Rise show based on the series, and it costs less than this domestic set if you pre-order it now.If you can play PAL discs, it's a no-brainer."
5,I didn't get where I am today by...,"It's Super!On my top 10 British series list.Now, if they would only package DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE."
1,Preoccupied with sex,"I watched the first episode and half of the second, and they were preoccupied with sex. Not wholesome entertainment.Philip Martin"
4,A nicely written love story,"I really enjoyed this book! I loved the independent nature of the heroine in this novel, and the fact that she wasn't raised as nobility or upper class. The hero was equally memorable. This was my first Julie Garwood book, but I will be reading others."
3,Pretty good ...,"3.5 stars. I really liked the hero. The heroine was strong and athletic which I liked, though at times seemed a little brainless which annoyed me. I have to admit that I am childish enough to not like the hero to have prev been in love,(okay, okay, I know it is realistic that at his age he would have been married or in love before), however, the love story was strong and so overcame that little aspect :) I do wish we could have seen more of Christina's indian family. All in all worth the price of the book."
5,My favorite Garwood,"""Lion's Lady"" is my favorite Julie Garwood novel, and I have read them all. The love story is great, the sensuality is charmingly warm, and the various characters just seem to come alive on the page. The humor which constantly arises due the the contrasting cultures made me laugh all through the book. Christina and Lyon are both intelligent, likeable and strong. The lurking sense of danger which threads through the book makes the plot satisfying, and Christina's mother's journal entries (which start each chapter) are very poignant. I just love this book and would encourage anyone who loves the Regency genre to read it."
5,Good book,"Julie Garwood writes books with a smidgen of comedy.This is perhaps one of her best books. This book is structured with excerpts from the main character's mother's diary before each chapter. The diary excerpts explain her mothers life and fears concering her husband. Christina,the main character, goes back to england and meets Lion, a secret agent and a member of the ton. They fall in love and have to battle a secret enemy."
2,Not as well written as other Garwood books,"I'm finishing up this book right now, and I've been disappointed with both this and ""Guardian Angel"" (a related book). The non-romance plots are muddied and rushed, when they really had some potential. In this book in particular, the attention to dialog just isn't there. I could write better dialog and I'm no author!I'd recommend reading her Medieval/Scottish books - Saving Grace, The Wedding,etc. - they blend the right touch of interesting adventure plot, romance, strong characters, and humor."
5,Fav writer,I have collected most of the books written by Ms. Garwood and have thoroughly enjoyed her style. Her humor shows up at unexpected times to add another dimension to her writings.Love it!
5,passionate and thrilling,Absolutely loved this book. I loved the many romance scenes and the tension between the characters. the tension had you turning the pages as fast as you could because you become so hungry for more. Lyon and Christina are quite a pair and I hope she writes more one day on their romance. A must read!
3,undecided,"I'm undecided. It was a light read. Light being defined as danger and death not being the central focus, love scenes were somewhat rushed, and there were some areas it was comical. I did especially enjoy the part where Lyon awakes to find Christina has once again fallen out of bed.This was my first Garwood book. I'm giving her one more shot, Guardian Angel. I wasn't overly impressed with this. It was ok."
1,not julie's best work,"If you want to read something good from Julie Garwood, try Ransom. This book is not well written and the plot is a mess."
2,I hated this book!!!,"Well, maybe ""hate"" is too strong of a word for any Julie Garwood book. She and Judith McNaught are my favorite authors and I have read almost every one of their books. However, I really didn't like this one. Christina just seemed too loose for me. I liked how in Garwood's other books, the characters were married before they had sex. Christina seemed to always throw herself at Lyon and she had no inhibition whatsoever. While I liked the fact that she was totally self-reliant and could take care of herself, she had no caution, for example, going to the tavern by herself. I either didn't like the characters or were indifferent to them throughout the book. Of all the Julie Garwood books, this one is one of the worst."
2,Very Disappointed!!,"This is the first book by Julie Garwood that I have read. I was sorely disappointed with it. At first it was OK. The idea of a white child being raised with Indians was good. Once she gets to England it gets boring. I felt the book just dragged and dragged. It's obvious that Christina and Lyon are attracted to each other from the beginning. OK, then what???? We don't reaad of her father until the very end. All this build up about him and he has only a few pages in the end of the story. And what about her Indian family?? She could've at least gone and seen them. She sure had enough money to. So much for loving your family as she proclaimed to. I just couldn't get into these characters. I'm glad I took this book out of the library rather than have spent hard earned monry on it."
4,I really liked it,"I have read so many Garwood books, I liked this a lot, but not enough for 5 stars. Love at first sight, although Lyon didn't want it to be. But it's DESTINY the love that grows between the two. It's a great love story, a little mystery, and very well written book."
5,BEAUTIFUL WORK BY JULIE GARWOOD !!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love the way that Julie portrayed Christina and Lyon. I've read it over and over again. Every time I read it ,I can't put it down till I read it all . Every book I've read by her my heart leaps with every page !!! Whoever hasn't read this needs to . I know you'll love this book!!!!!"
4,"Nice shams, but color described incorrectly.","I ordered these shams because the description indicated that they were a ""subtle soft white stripe."" That would have been perfect with my bedding, but the actual solid yellow-gold color doesn't work for me. The shams seem to be a soft fabric with a high thread count, though the count is not indicated on the package. I would be very happy with the shams if the color were as described."
1,Very disappointed!,"I opened one of the packages and there was blood on the card that the sham was folded around. I promptly called Amazon and they replaced it. It was a waste of money, the first time I washed them, white patches appeared all over the shams as if they dye washed out. I was very, very disappointed with the quality and will not order them again. Don't waste your money!"
4,Definetly different,"I really do like Stevens' writing...the subjects that he writes about are very interesting as well..this book is a mixture of quite a few things...physics, murder, madness...some of the book gets a little too involved with the science but it doesn't take away from the overall experience..the book starts off with some very bizare goings-on..this isn't just your run of the mill murder mystery..my only problem with the book was that I found it hard to utilize teh suspension of disbelief...the latter half of the book relies HEAVILY on physics and space..and what happens..well, I'm not going to spoil it, but it was definetly way out of left field!But I do have to say that I enjoyed the book an awful lot. Definetly worth looking into."
4,A must Read!,"A masterful blend of Horror, Science Fiction and science fact. This author goes out of his way to research his subject material, making the premise plausible to the point of scaring the reader into thinking ""What if it were true?"""
2,Cat Collar,"Sorry but it did not workout, as our cat would not let it be. He bite into it and within 4 weeks it was gone."
3,fun,My girls are 8 and 6 and they enjoy playing this game! They like anything that has to do with HSM. and its not a singing game...its more arcade than sing along.
2,too difficult,"this is way too hard and somewhat boring. i am 7 years old and pretty coordinated, but this game is really difficult."
2,For Younger HSM fans only!,This game takes you through a competition for the best musical in the country. It involves timing notes or steps until you can click to play them. This game was fun at first but was repetitive after going through one level which only took about an hour. The entire game only took me one night of play or a few hours. I'm not a big HSM fan but I'm sure that for most fans hearing the songs and the character's face will be the only pleasure in this game. I would only recommend this game for kids only 10 or younger because they would not really care about the game but enjoy listening to the game.HSM fans might demand to have this game and love it but as a unbiased player I don't love. Although I did not purchase this game for myself I think that it could have been better written.
3,OK,In this game you make Music videos and do dancing but It ends very quick but it is OK Here is my smiley rate :(
3,More fun once I got the hang of it.,I got this on one of those great deals Amazon always has. I guess I was thinking more like American idol. It is an good game but probably more for teens. I thought it might be a break from all brain games and it is but not one I'm going to get addicted to.After working with it more I am liking it better. It is a good eye hand coordination game than I first thought. You have to have exact on time actions to get good results.It is actually better than I first thought. Just wanted to come back and update my review so anyone on the fence about buying as an adult you may just like the change of pace. The music is very upbeat.
2,Don't Buy,My daughter turned the game on twice and hasn't used it sinse. It's too difficult and doesn't make sense.I would have expected better where High School Musical is such a hit but the game is not.
1,This game didn't make the cut.,"For any of us 18-30 year old HSM fans, this game is a disappointment. The only thing real are the photos of the actors from the movie, everything else is not authentic. The graphics are cheesy and the object of the game is pointless and repetitive. Should you buy the game just for the music...don't! The songs are re-recorded by demo singers. Unfortunately, I really think Disney cut some BIG corners with this game. The first chance I get, I'm trading it in for something else."
5,Pecan Pie Pecans,Love this item -- looked all over Vero Beach for a store that carried the Pecan Pie flavor -- no luck -- went to the Emerald site and was redirected to Amazon -- bought a case and am going to buy another. These things are habit forming.
3,Pecan Pie Glazed Pecans,"I had bought these as something different to add as stocking stuffers but I made the of opening a bag. Well, I only gave away two bags and the rest I just couldn't part with. They were delicious!!"
4,tuckpointer,"I am a tuckpointer. marshaltowns are the best, but they shouldnt cost over $8 a piece. $16 is outragiously high."
2,Rods,"I hoped for more. Rather generic information that could be found almost anywhere on the internet, fairly basic, no real secrets here."
5,The most wonderful voice I have heard in a generation,"I love this man's voice, it is simply the purest and most lyrical I have heard from his generation of singers. I just can't get enough of the songs, they are moving and sometimes quite funny in a very touching way. More please!"
5,Great product,"LOVE IT! Lightweight, easy to set up, kids love it. Comes in a great carrying bag. Would recommend to anyone. Great for extra seating in backyard, just pull up a table and of course at sporting events."
3,"Great, while it lasts.","Just bought my second bench. The first lasted two soccer seasons before tearing. For the price, should have lasted a little longer."
5,Gundam Seed Vol. 9: Evolutionary Conflict,"We're almost to the finale with the boom, but not yet! We have ten more episodes, and they ar e getting better and better. Also, the Atlantic Federation will begin construction of a terrifing new weapon. Remember Libra? Or Solarray? Well think of that times 50. Anyway, the episodes inclided are as follows:Phase 41: The Shaking WorldPhase 42: Lacus SortiesPhase 43: The one who blockes the wayPhase 44: Spiral Shaped encounterPhase 45: The Opened door.-----Anime, robot, scifi, action lovers REJOICE!"
2,A Big Disappointment,Not to knock the band or the music but having a 5 song ep - rereleased as the 20th Anniversary collectors edition cd was very disappointing --- Amazon should have at least list the songs on it or labelled it as a ep/mini cd.
4,Great little setup,"Fantastic looking setup from infinity. Big but not too big, it fits perfect in the back of my Mazda 6. This thing hits like a ton of bricks, even vibrates my nose. It does tend to be a bit boomy, though I am personally used to sealed enclosures. That is the only reason I did not give it a 5. The splipstream port offers absolutely silent air movement even at max volumes, which I have always been picky about, so that is great. Easy to wire up to a mono-block amp at 2ohms. I runit with Infinity's 600watt RMS mono amp and it's a perfect fit. Not much more to say about it, it is a great little setup."
5,Great pedals for transit cycling.,"I own two pairs of these, one for a hybrid and another for a Cruzbike build. I ride about fourteen miles a day through the center of Houston, rain or shine. These pedals are strong and well sealed, and the wide rubber treads hold well under all kinds of footwear, even when wet. They can also be used comfortably with bare feet when the weather gets really hot."
3,Most as expected,"I had heard several of the songs on webcasts or XM and was drawn to this disc. However, for the most part, the 2-3 songs that were being played tend to be the best on the disc. The remaining songs are not quite of the same caliber. Still, they are somewhat enjoyable, but I think for overall cohesiveness the disc could have been better if all the songs followed the style of 3 best songs."
5,Excellent and Comprehensive,"This complete guide offers both practical financial advice for everyone and also guidelines for Christians. It is comprehensive and covers debt, investing, budgeting, giving, insurance, inheritance, etc... There were so many points that made me ponder the choices that we make every day. I plan to give this book as gifts to all of my family and friends. Their lives will be much happier if they read and apply the principles taught in this wonderful book."
5,"Money, Possions, and Eternity","This is part of a Bridal shower gift for my grandson and his bride to be, How we use what God has given us is very important both now and when we stand before HIM."
4,"Good book, kind of repetitive","I am glad I have had an opportunity to read most of this book. I have to admit, though, that I did not read all of it. It is just too repetitive. Randy has good points, but like many preachers, he tends to say them over and over and over again.I read the first section of the book and then skipped to some interesting appendixes he has in the back. Maybe someday I will read the middle of the book.Still, it is a book worth reading, and I learned much from what I did read.Recommended."
5,Very Convicting!,"I agreed with some of the previous reviews that this book is extremely convicting and is for those who are ready to step up in their christian life - start to invest eternally (store up treasures in heaven). It is a thick book, but one can benefit tremendously by gaining the perspective on money and possessions and other aspects of our life. It encourage us to delay gratification (power, possessions and pleasure) in this present world, so that we can achieve future, eternal ones in heaven."
4,true eye opener for God's instruction for handling money,it's a great book and although i am not finished reading it yet the content is excellent and will be a blessing to those who want to do what's right with the money and the possessions that God's blesses them with to be stewards over.
2,book about tithing....,"The first part of this book is good, but then gets into tithing as a place to start giving and goes on from there. The author doesn't understand that Israel was a theocratic society and the tithes were to fund Israel's government: the priests, etc. just like how our taxes today fund our government.I think the first part of the book is useful in that it puts possessions and money in perspective for the Christian."
5,Great money managing guide,This is the best book I have read on the subject. It has been very inspiring and I am thrilled at applying what I am learning. He covers everything and challenges the reader to check the validity of the book with Scripture. I have found it right on and feel that we need this teaching in our churches. It makes you think about what you are doing and where you're headed. I highly recommend it.
3,A Thought Provoking Examination of Materialism and the Giving Antidote,"This was a good read.The book helped me to examine my material inclinations and how giving is the antidote to materialism.As a metaphysical Christian, I felt that some of Mr. Alcorn's assertions were beyond my present belief system.At the same time, I do agree with Tithing and with Giving beyond the Tithe.I have not reached the level of Christian maturity, at this time, that I am willing to set a boundary and say that ""Beyond a set amount of Income, I will give all to God"".I do believe that everything material belongs to God (Source Energy); and that my material possessions are worldly and do not retain a lasting (heavenly) value. I admire Mr. Alcorn and his ability to give freely, and I do think that the bookMoney, Possessions, and Eternityhas helped me to become aware of my motives as I Give, Save, and Spend money that comes to me. I hope that my decisions will be wiser as a result of reading this book."
5,Excellent non-technical overview of QM.,"This is one of the best ""intro"" books for those of us whose math skills are limited. Dr. Guillemin takes us from the genesis of QM all the way to it's philosophical implications. There are quite a few diagrams to explain things along the way.The material covered is wide in scope and thus gives one a great overview of Quantum Mechanics. The math involved is quite easy to follow. However, do not think this is a quick easy read. To really appreciate the text one's full attention is required.I wanted to read this book for many years and finally got around to it. Excellent introduction albeit a little dated."
5,A great new animal behavior textbook,"This is the textbook that the field of animal behavior has been waiting for. Because this is an edited volume, with experts in the various disciplines having written the chapters, there is no bias towards e.g. an evolutionary or mechanistic approach. There is a remarkable unity of style, despite the diverse collection of authors. The chapters are very accessible and convey an enormous enthusiasm for the study of animal behavior. This is the most comprehensive animal behavior textbook that I know, with topics ranging from neuroscience and biological rhythms to sexual selection and animal welfare. This is likely to be the leading textbook for some time to come."
3,Somewhat helpful,"After purchasing my MO8 I was quite impressed with the poower and capability of this keyboard. However, being new at programming, sequencing etc. I was intimidated by the complexity of how to take advantage of what it could do.I was pleased to find ""Go Mo Instant Guide to Making Music With the Mo"", so I gladly spent the $35 to order it. It helped me to see what the Mo was capable of and to dig into the manual, step-by-step to find out how to do it. The video does not give you that step-by-step instruction but it does show you how to use some of the keyboard's functions and programs.I would recommend this to someone, like myself, who needs that extra push, or someone that wants to get an insightful look at what this keyboard does before making the purchase."
1,Helpful...but really bad..,"Let's face it, in order to operate any yamaha product these days you need a PHD in computer engineering. The video is helpful, but it is really really bad. They explain what the MO can do (sorta), but it doesnt explain how it can be done. The commmon phrase they say in this is ""we don't wanna drown you with information......"" I see it like this, if I paid 1,000 bucks for a keyboard that's difficult to operate I'd want you to drown me in as much information as possible. If I feel it's too much I can fast forward. It's helpful, but bad. Don't buy it new. Buy it, learn from it, and then get rid of as soooon as possible."
2,"Cute, but there are a few problems","I really liked these boots at first, but it didn't take me long to notice that there is almost no traction on the bottom, and you can unexpectedly slip on fall on tile, pavement made of smooth rocks, or even concrete pavement if it's on the slightest decline.I've had these boots for about a year, maybe a bit more and they look really shabby already even though I don't wear them often because the leather is sooo thin that the tips of both toes got badly worn pretty quickly.Overall, they're cute, and they're great if you're buying them for a specific occasion and don't intend on them lasting forever, but otherwise it might be smart to spend an extra $30 - $40 for a more durable pair of boots."
3,color is not as picture,"I purchased a gray pair and what I receive was definitely different from the pictures. It was greenish+grayish, don't really know how to describe it. Also, the boots are kinda tight, I would suggest go half size up. Maybe it's just me, so you should try this before buying them."
5,Wiggley Fun!,My then 2 1/2 year old received this as a Christmas gift last year. He is now 3 1/2 and still plays with this toy all the time. I'll admit it can be a little noisy. But he loves it! I have even observed my six year old daughter playing with it. My kids are hard on toys so for this one to be still going as much as they play with it I would say it is very durable.
2,Where Are The Wiggles?,"I was going to buy this for my boy who lives for two things: The Wiggles and Guitars. We own the older one so I was willing to look at this one for a replacement. While the guitar moving about is very fun, the voices sound like chipmunks. Unlike the rest of The Wiggles toys that use actual sound clips of the familiar Greg, Murray, Anthony, Jeff and Captain Feathersword, these are not authentic clips. In paying for a character themed toy, I expect them to sound like the characters. This is disheartening. I say if the sound of the clips matter to you, like they do for my boy and myself, pass over this guitar."
1,Great gift for parents you don't like,"Loud, noisy, no volume control, buttons respond as they are pressed, meaning you can interrupt any noise/song with another with just a push. The noise that comes from the thing is grating, moronic, and incessant. On the plus side, I got to show the kids some old footage of The Who and just happened to have the guitar on hand for emulation purposes."
3,"Good, but...","This is good for someone who just needs a little help, but i had several problems. It tends to over-simplify actions. It is sometimes not detailed. It does not list where most objects are. And i ahve found multpil times where is said that it was impossible to remain undetected, but i remain undetected."
4,Fun classic from my childhood,"I just saw this last night on maybe Encore Family, stayed up much later on a Saturday night than normal, was so pleased to see this show from my childhood. Good old fashioned ghost story. Susan & her brother Johnny come across an old map that may be a clue in finding gold, while staying at their aunt and uncle's house. Susan has been having nightmares about Rachel, a young girl who vanished in 1889 from a nearby mansion when her parents were killed by bank robbers. The siblings make friends with Billy the old reclusive cousin and soon began their search for the treasure as well as find out what happened to Rachel. Wished I could have dvr'ed it but it was half way through and did not have another scheduled showing. Story reminded me so much of the fantasy stories so popular now for that 9-14 age. Wish they would has this on dvd as a burn on demand option like another classic gem I just picked up Child of Glass."
1,Dated Book - Best Options 10 Years Ago,"This book is so dated that it misses a lot of the best spots and (accordingly) can't possibly provide the Best and Most Romantic Weekends. The pictures are nice but, since this book is published in 2000 and most reviews then are from 1999 (at best!), the ratings are very dated and new establishments which own the local market are not eve mentioned."
1,Boring,This held my 18 month and 3 year old twin's attention for a whole 5 minutes and they normally love care bears. I was hesitant to buy it reading some of the other negative reviews but decided to give it a try. I must agree with a previous reviewer who said some of the characters from this town Joke-a-lot are pretty scary looking. I would recommend Care bears Big Wish and Oopsy Does it over this movie. It doesn't flow as well as the other care bears movies did and my little one's did not enjoy it at all.
2,Whatever happened to the REAL Care Bears?,"I must say I was terribly disappointed in this movie. Having watched the Care Bears for most of my childhood and well through High School, I was disappointed to find that in this movie many of my favorite Care Bears were portrayed as sqeaky, whiny, not-really caring Care Bears. The music and lyrics were catching, but I feel that the writers and directors should have put more thought into the Care Bears and portrayed them as we as parents know and love them."
1,A True Disappointment,"I just finished watching this movie with my 3 kids (4-1/2 boy and 2-1/2 twin girls). They are all avid Care Bear fans and love the old cartoons. After the initial five minutes where the Care Bears all appear they lost interest. Except for Funshine Bear, you hardly see the other Care Bears as most of the plot takes place in Joke-A-Lot; a land full of grotesque creatures who are neither amusing or cute to look at. Where are Hugs and Tugs, The Care Bear Stare, Beastly, Shrieky, Lord No Heart? Don't get your hopes up for the CD either - there are 3 songs in the whole movie so I'm sure it will be a waste of money as well.This movie had great potential - its too bad they blew it."
3,Not The Same,"Okay, Sure this movie is cute and fun like 'Care Bears' of the past but The kids DO seem like 5 year olds. I know this movie is a new continuity but there's something missing.Fun for little Kids but not for Old Fans. If the 'Care Bear' owners wanted old fans to 're-connect' to the fanbase this movie does NOT do it!"
4,A good introduction for children to learn about God,"""Everyone wonders about God...We think about Him and wish we could see Him, but we don't need to see God to know what He is like.""Thus begins, ""A Book About God,"" a simple and beautifully illustrated story that explains God by comparing Him to things that are like Him and His love - the sky, the air, the sun, the rain, the sea - all things beautiful. The author paints a picture of a God who is loving, protective, gentle and always present - even when He can't be seen. The illustrations are beautiful depictions of nature.The book is non-sectarian but some readers may find the reference to God as a ""he"" to be problematic. However, ""A Book About God"" is a good beginning point for a subject that many children wonder and ask about and which is not easily explained or defined."
4,Enjoyable and interesting book,"I thought this was an enjoyable and interesting mystery. It kept my interest anyway, and even had some good character development. A couple of things were never explained at the end (what did Juan Gabriel and Lawrence have a fight about?) but overall I liked it."
4,Good Mystery,"I really liked this book. I finished it in 3 days, couldn't put it down. I read Silversword which I really liked also, in condensed form in a Reader's Digest book, that made me seek some other books by Phyllis Whitney. The ending suprised me, it was not what I was guessing."
1,"This swan was born ugly, grew up ugly and is still ugly.",Someone gave me a copy of this book when it first came out because they knew of my familiarity with the area in which the story takes place. I read the book out of curiosity and found it dull. I am glad I haven't read any of Whitney's other books. She is too full of hot air.
3,A fine second book,"Where did dogs come from? How high can a dog jump? How sensitive is a dog's scent? How do dogs communicate? These are just a few of the questions Seymour Simon answers in Dogs.Dogs is loaded with small and large photos of many different breeds. It would have been nice if they were labeled. The front cover however does break down a few breeds under the five main breed: Hounds, Terriers, Sporting Dogs, Working Dogs, and Herding Dogs.I was disappointed in the size/price comparison of this book. A rather small book for the hefty price of $23.99 CAN. But surprised how much data was contained there in. The content is easy to read, to the point and entertaining enough for any adult that may be following along. The hardcover and heavy pages are sure to be durable for the recommended 4-8 age group.A fine second book if you can find it in your bargain section."
4,full of neat info,"This book is a wonderful introduction for children to the world of the dogs. This will teach young children lots of facts about dogs. This book shows us all about the cats overall characteristics, descriptions of birth and growth and lots more neat facts. At the end of the book are some helpful questions to ask your family before deciding if a cat is the right pet for your family.We liked looking at the various breeds of dogs. The full color photos were very good and educational.This is a great book that appeals to children and dog lovers alike."
3,Very cute and cuddly,"This is the second cockatoo from Cuddlekins that I ordered. It is very cute, very soft and cuddly. In my case it was for a team mascot so we're not concerned with its usefulness as a toy - it met our need and it's very soft and hugable."
5,An awesome gift :),"This stuffed animal is one of the sweetest things Ive ever seen. Its soft too. If your a bird lover, or a cockatoo owner, this is a great gift to own."
4,Beginner's Book to all Husky Type Dogs,"This book doesn't seem so good from the cover, but truthfully it's great. It has TONS of photos inside and explains behavior and training methods. It is a good book to start with if you are trying to decide what kind of Husky dog to buy."
2,Terrible Dubbing into English,"This version is dubbed very badly. The words are not in sync with the scenes. It also has subtitles, which makes it a little easier to understand, but it would be much better if left in the original Swedish!Note this is for the Amazon Instant View rental version, and Not for the Criterion DVD which is purchased. The Criterion version evidently is in the original Swedish."
3,a review of the disability,"Autumn Sonata was a film I watched to evaluate the portrayal of the disability that Helena has due to tuberculosis. Thus, my view is that the character Helena was put in the film simply to add drama with her dramatic and not necessarily accurate scenes in which she falls out of her bed and crawls to the den screaming MAMA, MAMA. She is not shown, except for three times in the film, each scene illustrating her as a child, which she is not, and her diability would not make her so. Basically, if you are to think about it, she doesn't eat with them or socialize with the family at all. It's a terrible portrayal, and that's my schtick."
4,Gripping at the Least,"You could never call yourself a fan of film if you've never seen an Ingmar Bergman film. This would be a good on to cut your teeth on. He brings in Ingrid Bergman (in one of her final film roles, speaking in her native tongue) as a mother who has been out of town making a living. Ingmar Bergmans film touches are many: It is shot as near naturally as possible with hardly any lighting, many long takes, and the actresses wearing as little make up as possible. In the short time this movie runs it will grip you, forcing you two take sides in a no win situation. Touching and tragic. Another Bergman (and Bergman) winner."
5,Bergmans and Ullmann,"Ingmar Bergman is probably the greatest filmmaker of all time.Ingrid the greatest actress,remember she worked with Renoir,Hitchcock and Ingmar (among others) But,as always,is a Liv Ullmann movie.Liv Ullmann (with Ingrid Thulin) is the ultimate Bergman actress.The main thing here is really this 2 great actress...everything else seems pointless.At this point the great master didn't have anything else to prove ,and he let them fly."
3,bergman on bergman (with a touch of liv),"the performances of ingrid bergman and liv ullman are indeed to be admired, but i felt little but wearied in watching this late ingmar bergman rehash of earlier themes. truth be told, it felt more like one of those dreadful woody allen attempts to equal him. its rare that a bergman film doesnt leave some haunting images seared into my brain long after; sad to say i remember next to nothing of this high class soap."
5,Very handy indeed!,"If you are pregnant, have small children, any that are potty training or just a long commute these are a life saver. They really hold quite a bit and do not leak. When you have one or maybe two little ones sleeping in the car and one person needs to go, these are the solution."
1,Increase price too much,Last July 2010 I bought this product for $ 0.13 each andDecember 2010 for $ 0.48 Each
5,Bronte is fantastic!,"I dedicated one of the poems in my recently published book of poems to Emily Bronte, and did so after falling in love with her own poetry. What divine spark burned within her bosom? What muses inspired her? Although we may never know, we can see their impact. Her poems are stunning, powerful, curious, entrancing."
1,Deadly - lists of objects disguised as a narrative,I am beyond bored by lists of objects disguised as books. No real effective theme. Dead writing - reads like a poor quality Masters' or Phd thesis.
2,A big disappointment,"The book began well but ended badly. Nothing connected for me, and after reading the ending twice, still don't understand what the point was. The book could have been so much better. I'll try another J.P. Beaumont book hoping this was just a bad one."
2,Seen it all before,"Is this a bad re-make of ""Demon Knight"" or what? For those of you who haven't seen Tales from the Crypt Presents-Demon Knight, I strongly suggest you view that INSTEAD of this bad imitation!!"
3,"""Feast"" not quite filling","For all the hype I heard about this film and all the relentless nagging from a friend for me to rent this, I was rather underwhelmed by the whole film. Neither funny enough nor scary enough to live up to its ""horror-comedy"" billing, ""Feast"" came off (to me) as too much in the Tarantino-wanna-be category ---- too much emphasis on trying to be stylish, clever, and or funny, and not enough emphasis on compelling storytelling.I doubt seriously I will even bother to check out the two sequels (currently in post-production as I write this)."
3,"Gory and Disturbing, interesting","I never heard of the Feast movies until a friend had purchased the movies and sometime I had to go about borrowing the movies from him when I had a chance. If there's anything if you're not a fan of horror movies than you may want to steer clear of this franchise by any means necessary. There is one thing that I can say about this movie that it's sick and I don't mean that in the good way either, what I mean is that the gore in the movie can make anyone that have a weak stomach go throw up if you ate anything prior to watching the movie. If I were to comment on the writing it seems to be decent at most for a horror movie but I'm not sure that I can say it's good, though it does have it's moments and the acting doesn't seem to be that bad. Even so there are some things in this movie that may end up grossing you out if you're not careful, but I won't dare to say what any of that is. Overall I give Feast, 3 stars out of 5."
3,Not too bad,"I purchased this HD-DVD because of the price and I had watched the making of the movie during Project Greenlight. I was interested to see how the move turned out after all the problems that were on the set during it's filming. I'm not a huge fan of horror films, but this wasn't that bad. The performances by the ensemble cast did a decent job pulling it off. The directing was OK as was the script. I didn't find the movie all that frightening or suspenseful. I guess since I knew what it was about, it kind of took away from the suspense. Not a bad first movie for Gulager's first directing gig. The movie takes place in a dive bar out the middle of no where. The bar is besieged by a group of aliens/monsters (not sure which) who are trying to get to the patrons of the bar. The people in the bar must fight off the monsters in various ways. It wasn't a bad movie considering I only paid $9 for it from Amazon."
2,Not the unrated version.,"I specifically baught the unrated version, on the blu ray case and disc it even says unrated but it was just the original version of the film."
2,"Dear Hollywood, the ""shaky cam"" fad is over. Do photography right!!","This could have been a pretty entertaining (though silly) horror flick.But noooooooo, they completely RUIN it with that damn stupid and jujune ""shacky cam"",fast-motion quick cuts in close up, among other trendy ""hip"" camera gimmicks, so you cant actuallysee what is going on unless you play back in slow motion.Hey Hollywood folks; the fad is dead!! hold the damn camera still and photograph the set theway you were trained in school."
4,feast,this is the movie you want to see for being scared by monters it good series all three are good
4,Feast Delivers. Not Disappointed.,"According to IMDB, the ultimate budget was around $3 Million. I've seen horror films with ten times the pocketbook with a far weaker result. This movie gets moving in a hurry and only lets its foot off the pedal for a some necessary dialog here and there. It is by no means perfect, but nothing ever is. Nevertheless, if you are a horror fan (and by that I don't mean weak, flashy, PG-13, go-nowhere mood peices like ""The Grudge"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"") then you will enjoy this movie. Just a warning to the faint of heart: there is at least one disturbing death scene in this film even for a slash flick. If you can handle Texas Chainsaw or House of 1,000 Corpses, it'll be fine. The true shame is that this movie never got to see the light of day. Nice work Gulager, Dunstan, Melton and Crew."
2,Not Impressed,"I saw this in production on Project Greenlight and waited forever for it to be released. This movie is what I like to call a ""one timer"". Some of the actors were so dead serious it was laughable. It takes place in a dirty old bar out in the middle of nowhere (Evil Dead 2). An annoying couple suddenly burst in and announce that they are being chased (now we know where those costumes wound up from ""The Village""). They go into the boarding-up-the-bar routine while the body count increases. I thought the project greenlight show was 10 times more interesting."
4,Irreverant and fun,"Feast has to laugh at itself - it's a stereotypical horror film in so many ways, and it doesn't even try to hide it. The character development consists of 2 or 3 printed lines on the screen for each person introduced in the film. Feast pulls no punches, it knows what kind of audiance is going to appreciate it: fans of fast action, explicit gore, and a plot that moves at a break-neck pace, not concerned with originality. This gives Feast the feel of a movie that is almost a satire of itself - making fun of the fact that it exists. The end result is a fun gore-flick that has adequate acting, a few cameos, and tons of blood, dismemberments, guts, etc."
4,This was a great Movie!!!,"Feast is great! From the character introductions to the over the top kills it was great. Was it original? Hells no! Was it the most thrilling ride you'll have all summer? Nopa. But it did deliver on the laughs, gore and guts. This is a good movie to check out with some other horror buffs, and have a good time. And the chicks in the film are gorgeous!!!!"
4,A great campy horror flick,"I bought this one on a whim, but it's actually pretty entertaining. The budget was slim, but they did a good job with what they had."
4,"Finally !, a recently made B-movie worth buying.","Finally !, a recently made B-movie worth buying. This gory little horror gem succeeds in doing what the majority of other recent efforts have not, It actually lives up to the quotes on the DVD case it comes in! If you are considering buying a horror film to watch over the next few days, buy this and give the Hills Have Eyes part 2 a miss."
2,A little over the top...,"Although the effects and acting werent half bad, this flick isnt all that great. The movie took itself to seriously for what it was... a horror comedy. I found myself laughing at it more that anything, and there was no build up to the action. It just seemed that these silly creatures came outa no where, humping and eating everything in there path.Also... this movie just seemed to rip off ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", which took away from its originality. I suppose there is worse out there but if your looking for a laugh mixed with an occasional scare then this is your movie."
3,i fall asleep with this one,"i bought this dvd yesterday night...i watched it with my bother and sister... and I fall asleep not even at half of the movie... it's not that it was boring... it's just i was too tired. anyways the movie was quite interesting... good scares, blood, and suspense... and some humor too... i'd rate it more... but i'll have to watch it again..."
4,FEAST: Gulager's great goo and gore.,"I watched the making of the film, FEAST on the now defunct IFC series, ""Project Green Light"" and felt something [empathy I suppose] for the winning Director, John Gulager. As He nervously navigated his way through the spotlight directing his first [?] feature length project -John's on-camera discomfort & shyness were in full exploitive view, yet He became an endearing protagonist to the viewing audience. Using tools, crew, budget and most of all a cast he had never been able to afford [nor want in some cases], he directed a great little film. Buy it for someone -if not yourself- for Halloween! And somebody..., give this guy another shot -without the spotlight."
3,Third time the charm.,Not too bad. Finally Project Greenlight turns out a somewhat worthy product. The third time was the charm.
2,Eh.....,"This movie would have been a lot more enjoyable if they would have slowed down the action scenes so that you could actually SEE what's going on! It became quite annoying but not as annoying as the freeze frame stats on the characters. Funny at first but made me roll my eyes after awhile.It, to me, was a wanna-be Quentin Tarantino ""From Dusk 'til Dawn"" esque film. Some of the characters were VERY annoying to me to the point I couldn't wait for them to get offed. *Possible spoiler* The ending bit with the creature getting ""arm choked"" was such a rip-off of the old 80's ""Just Before Dawn"" classic ending. SOooo unoriginal! I gave it an extra star just for the fact that I was entertained somewhat enough to finish watching. It takes a lot more than gore or cinematic tricks to get me to rate higher."
1,Total crap.,"Horror is my all time favorite genre, so I've seen A LOT of horror movies, including a lot of cult/indie stuff that was well done, disturbing and creepy, and still maintained a good storyline. This movie, however, is complete and total crap. If it were possible, I'd give it zero stars (wouldn't process the review.. I tried). I'm sorry I wasted the five dollars and an hour and a half of my life. It's not even worth the effort of selling it for a 12 cent amazon gift card. Don't waste your time."
1,C R A P,"Feast your eyes on a different movie. This one is a HUGE waste of time. The movie feasted on my nerves and ate up 80 minutes that I'll never get back. Horrible monsters, horrible characters, lame director. Were Matt Damon and Ben Affleck High when they chose this guy? C'mon guys...give us something ORIGINAL! Feast...brought to you by Project STOPLIGHT. The movie moves slower than my last bowel movement! Do I smell bargain bin? Use this DVD as a coaster, door stop,or as something for target practice..just dont watch it!"
4,A good movie,"I saw this movie at a pre-screening. I don't give it five stars because it's basic premise is that of the movie ""Dusk till Dawn!"" That aside, I still it's worth going to see.More funny then it is a horror movie, I mean the monsters look so FAKE!! And the brave hero dies in say 3 secs. Don't worry others will arise to save the day.Now this ain't a comedy because there is as much gore as there are laughs ... check that there is I think more gore! Okay, Comedy-horror movie! That's the best way to explain it! But don't go expecting to be scaried if your over 15 or maybe over 13. You will be disappointed."
1,feast,"if this movie was indeed directed by matt damon and ben affleck, it goes to show that they both are sexually disturbed by beastiality or both are sexually attracted to eachother because this movie is indeed very disturbing and disgusting."
5,Feast (Unrated Edition),i loved it... it you like horror movies this is worth adding to the collection
3,Horror with humor,"This is horror with a bit of humor. Heroes get eaten, motivational speakers make stupid speeches and come up with bad ideas and the babes do more sharp shooting than the big mouth, brawny men. They're fighting an unknown species that wears road kill for decorations (I will say that's a new twist) and this alien being has instant babies after sex. Well, this flick gets so stupid you have no choice but to regurgitate a few chuckles, if your eyes don't roll to the back of your head first. I vote this one most likely to be spoofed in a 'Scary Movie' episode. There's certainly plenty to make fun of, but I was minimally entertained. I'd choose it over the latest Woody Allen movie...Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,Delivers what it advertises.,"You aren't going to get a plot and really in-depth characters, but you'll get some blood and guts mixed in with a few one liners. This kind of reminded me of the new Rambo movie only with aliens and not vietnamese kidnappers. Actually Rambo was better, but this was good if you aren't expecting a deep movie."
4,From Project Greenlight to my video collection,I loved this movie. If you watched the series Project Greenlight (the making of the movie) you will really like this.
3,Worth seeing,"This is more like 3 and a half stars for me.There isn't much of a plot, just some people trapped in a bar trying to survive the onslaught on some rather unpleasant creatures. However from the start the film doesn't take itself to seriously. There is a comedy element that runs through a lot of the film, which results in a number of laugh out loud moments, which seems quite inappropriate baring in mind the carnage going on a lot of the time.The horror is well done. Suspense and outright gore, together with few moments that are pretty disgusting especially if you don't like maggots! I thought the acting was pretty good and what there was of a script was pretty sharp (especially the comedic element). Its also worth baring in mind that this was made on shoestring budget. For the budget they have produced a fine film.So overall an enjoyable film that surprised me quite a few times, even if it isn't that original."
4,"Think big, think pink","In this laaarge book you will get trough the pink panther history divided in five decades, from the sixties to the new millenium. This includes the movies and the tv shorts of the pink panther and all De Patie - Freleng known cartoons, such as the Ant and the Aarvark, The Inspector, CrazyLegs Crane, Roland and Rattfink and such.This title features great original artwork complemented with some explanatory notes, though they are quite obvious, except from some cool factoids that every fan would find interesting.Possibly this is the best official source for information on the pink feline on the market, but to be honest, there is few that one cannot investigate by himself."
4,Good but Not Complete,"This is a very good book on the Pink Panther in films and art. However, it is not complete. It ignores and does not even metion the RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER film. Yet, it is the best book on the subject to date."
3,Where's RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER?,"I assume MGM/Sony had marching orders to avoid any mention of RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER since they don't own the rights, but how ridiculous to have an overview of the series and NOT EVEN MENTION the film that relaunched the franchise in the mid '70s?Even the ""black sheep"" of the series INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU is in here -- but not Sellers' own 1975 sequel? It's absurd!"
3,"Amusing, yet not terribly useful","This tiny little phrasebook is a funny read, but its practical applications are, um, limited, unless you really want to say things like ""I'd like some pasta of the slut."" For folks who've been to Italy, I'd imagine it's even more amusing than it is for us who haven't been over the pond.There are a few useful items within, such as the names of important medicines and whatnot, but overall, this is just a book for fun. If you're really looking to pick up A Real Phrasebook, be sure to grab something else besides this one, and perhaps keep this one in your pocket (it's *really* tiny!) for when you feel like freaking out your cab driver or some such."
3,Così-così,"The book provides an entertaining snapshot of Italian culture and is worth the five bucks. But, if you are looking for some good slang, Wicked Italian only scratches the surface. Some translations don't quite match up, and some expressions aren't correct."
4,Va bene!,Well worth the money! I was able to convince a native Italian to go out with me by using a couple of the humorous and somewhat suggestive phrases offered in this book. I was later informed by this same person that there are some grammatical errors and a few phrases make no sense at all.
2,Trapanazione!,"If you're looking for really wicked Italian, ask your uncle Vito. (And if you don't have one, try your local pizzeria). Pretty mild stuff. In a word it was, well -- trapanazione."
2,Great game but poorly constructed.,There are plenty of 'Shut the Box' games available for half the price or less but I was looking for better quality and was willing to spend more. Shipping was superb and the game was beautifully wrapped in special paper and I thought what a lovely gift this was going to be. Unfortunately the craftsmanship of the game itself was severely disappointing and will be keeping the game because it would be too embarrassing to give to someone else. The quality of the catalog that came enclosed far exceeded that of the game.
3,Could have had a bit more content,"This Movie could have had a bit more content and a little better acting BUT with that said, I watched the entire show and left it feeling like i did not waste my time. Wasting time with some of these movies,shows happens more than not so since i did not get that feeling i still gave it a 3 star rating."
3,unsatisfying,"there are pluses and minuses to buying books with multiple authors, even if half are favorites. the stories seem rushed and unfinished so much so I feel somewhat cheated, like the real story is still out there waiting to be read. the plus side, is that sometimes a reader findes a whole new author to love and put on the keep shelf. My disappointment is my problem, if you like these authors then go for it. You might be more pleased than I was."
3,Meh,"I love Wyndham werewolves, and this story was pretty good, but not my favorite. The Mageverse story was worth reading, but the oher two, well, I just wasn't interested at all. So if I were you, I'd skip those."
3,3 out of 4 are worth reading,"4 storiesAngela Knight, Moon DanceIt's more erotica than romance, and the story is minimal, merely providing the setup to some pretty graphic sex. Not bad.Virginia Kantra, Between the Mountain and the MoonA forgetable story about love and revenge. Very soft, sweet, and not very interesting, but readable and enjoyable.Maryjanice Davidson, DriftwoodMore interesting characters, feels the most fleshed out of all the stories, and is written with her usually biting, fun flair. I enjoyed this the most.Sunny, Mona Lisa ThreePure dreck. Again, more erotica than romance, with graphic sex, and just not that interesting. There are a lot of references to events from other books, which completely negates the point of a short story to stand on its own merits. The writing is atrocious. I wont be reading her other books."
2,Was looking forward to this book! Bummer!!!!!!!!,"I was so looking forward to this anthology! From the reviews it was given. Guess I should never believe 5 star ratings anymore.The stories were just so - so. I can't even remember much about them. I stopped reading the book for awhile, then picked it again up hoping another author would have a better story! NOT!!!!!!!!!!!Read it if you want to but, you will be disappointed."
4,okay,"Four short stories. MaryJanice Davidson threw in a little lone werewolf/vampire part that was weird, but okay. Angela Knight added a story about a bitten werewolf that agrees to protect one of the nobility from a bad situation (this I felt was the best story). I've never heard of or read anything by Virginia Kantra. She wrote a story about the Fae that was okay, nothing memorable about it. And then onto the last story by Sunny.I have read Sunny's two other books in this series and enjoy them greatly. In her first book, she flat out tells you that she was inspired by early Laurell K. Hamilton and other paranormal romance writers and that she created her world based on what they started, so don't get all uppity about it. Also, her books are labeled as erotica, so you can expect a lot of heavy sex. This short story, even though it is labeled ""Three,"" is actually based between her first and second novel. I thought it was a good contribution to her series."
3,Not on 2 discs; No menu,"The description for this item says the 5 programs are on two discs, however it is not. The package I received was a new, unopened package. On the outside of the package is says ""Two-Dvd Set Contains:"", but there was only 1 disc in the package. All of the advertised programs are on the one disc, but there is no menu; all programs run back-to-back so you have to fast-forward or skip-to-a-scene to find the individual programs. What a pain! I don't mind that all programs are on one disc. The fact that the disc has no menu system is what I don't like. The content of the programs are okay and what I expected. Same problem with the V-J Day dvd."
3,Still no 'Pain',Tupac's pain is the only thing missing that would make this the best sdtk ever done. But Pain is a huge omission especially since I can only find it on itunes and not on a compliation. Figured after all of this time somebody would actually put pain on this.
4,Good but missing two great songs.,"Good CD, but (and I think I speak for many) where is ""Pain"" by 2Pac?? Also, why wasn't ""Holler if You Hear Me"" on the Sountrack and also a song by YZ (not sure of the Title). If anyone know's where to find ""Pain"", please let me know. I know it is on the cassette, but I want it on CD."
3,Could have been a 5,"I'm not even a fan of hip hop really... But there was some90's tracks that I liked and some of them was on this soundtrack. It seems that regulate and Pour out alittle Liquorare the best tracks here. There is also Part time Loverand Anything are really good tracks also. I hate to beata dead horse, but Pain and Loyal To The Game are missinghere and they should be. No excuses IMO. If those two songsare here I give this album a perfect 5. However, it's stillworth picking up because it's a good overall album for arap/hip hop album."
1,No pain (harris63077@hotmail.com),"The only reason i bought this cd is because of the song ""pain"" by 2pac and it's not even on the cd. WHY? is the question every rap fan wants to know. anyways if anyone knows where i can get this song on cd pleeeeeaaassseee email me."
2,I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!!!!!,"I bought this soundtrack because I loved the song PAIN by Tupac Shakur in the movie (wich is the main theme of the movie by the way) and LOYAL TO THE GAME wich is a great song in the movie (by Tupac Shakur too). But These two songs are not in the soundtrack and I don't know why!!! I tought THIS was a sondtrack from Above the Rim, BUT HOW COME THE TWO BEST AND MOST IMPORTANT SONGS OF THE MOVIE AREN'T IN THE SOUNDTRACK??? The worst thing is that I've searched about three hours in the net for the album where these two songs are, but EVERY resource of Tupac Shakur discography says that PAIN AND LOYAL TO THE GAME ARE IN THE ABOVE THE RIM SOUNDTRACK AND THERE IS NO OTHER DISC WHERE THOSE TWO SONGS ARE RECORDED. This soundtrack is like selling a Miles Davis jazz album without any single Miles Davis theme in it. I'm feelling robbed right now"
4,The only time when you should buy the cassette version,"Because there are three bonus tracks that don't appear on the CD but on the tape, which are ""My Money Rite!"", 2Pac's ""Pain"", and ""Loyal to the Game"" with Pac, Treach (who kicks the best verse), and Riddler. The rest of the soundtrack has quality songs like ""Big Pimpin'"" (by Tha Dogg Pound, NOT Jigga) and H-Town's ""Part-Time Lover"". I thought this album was a classic when it came out in 1994 but there are some songs that, although sounded good back then, sound stupid now (Sweet Sable's ""Old Time Sake"" and Paradise's ""Hoochies Need Love Too"")."
3,the music it pretty good,"i like all the songs the movie it has..but on the cd i was looking for really one song...""the ghetto been good to me"" and it is not on here. i gave it only 3 stars because of the missing record i wanted so badly."
3,they missed out key songs,this album is good and dose have some true death row beats on it but they havent put pain by 2pac on this album and its one of his best tracks ever and dosent seam to be on any outher of his albums with out this track the album is incompleet and can only be given 3***s
4,The best soundtrack I have.,"I have the Tupac song ""Pain"", I got it on a import of Regulate. It also has another song by him called loyal to the game. If you see this import I sugest you buy it."
3,"Desprate for ""pain""","I had the cassette YEARS ago--it was stolen--and had ""pain"" by TUPAC on it--the cd does not..if ANYONE knows where to get my hands on a cd with pain on it--please contact me..."
3,where is PAIN ?,there isn't PAIN of 2PAC and this is a very bad thing. Fortunaly this CD got REGULATE else it would have been a poor CD. that's why I gave it only 3 stars (excuse my bad english too)
4,What's Old is New Again,"I own this tape,Yes the tape I bought it years ago and have played it several times every now and then;but what will make me listen to it again is the fact that,the song by:Sweet Sable is alive again-How?..Well, Alica Keys has given that song life again-her latest single""Unbreakable"" is sampled from that very song by Sweet Sable-Old Time Sake,was a nice song to me back then;but I love it even MORE since Alica used it for her song.Anybody that has this soundtrack play the song again and then listen to ""Unbrakeable""-it's wonderful to hear the simliarity; plus to tell the truth. I had been listening to Music Choice channnel(on cable)and Sweet Sable's version was on and that's when I realized the sample.Anyway it's a good song by both artist.I especailly love the lyrics to Alica's song.Take another listen,tell me what you think.[...]"
3,"Not as good as everyone says, missing a lot of good songs...","I bought this CD thinking that all the songs from the movie were going to be on it, but there were only about 3 good songs that were from the movie. There is only about 3 or 4 good songs on the entire CD, the rest of the CD is filled with BORING and OLD R/B music. They don't have the song ""Pain"" by 2Pac, they don't have the Kurupt song, and missing a lot of others. I rarely listen to this CD, not very good."
5,this is it yo,"this will be a classic soundtrack no matter what happens. i felt the soundtrack more than i felt the movie. the best song on the album is ""pain""...which i fail to see on this version. it was also a naughty by nature song on the album too....why did you all edit or leave out these valuable songs which help make the album a classic?!?!?"
4,PAIN???,"Does anyone know where to find the ""extra"" soundtrack of above the rim with the tupac track ""Pain""..........please email me..... Davidb@post8.tele.dk"
5,This CD is the best old school I've heard in a long time!!!,This CD is bumpin yo! This is the **** yo! Buy this CD yo! My friend Alex I Feel Like **** likes it to!
4,WOW!,"This CD is amazing! From the hard-hitting melodies of ""Why Don't you Feel,"" to the monumental instrumental ""minuet,"" This Album is great from start to finish! Highly recommend."
4,Chokaytomhanks,"Stuhrling Men's Odyssey Skeleton Watch #131.33151Magnificent, my first automatic timepiece and I choose Stuhrling for it's great quality, function, and excellent value!"
3,Good idea. Needs improvment.,I am a female with hips!! I have found that while the overall covered area is nice it does not allow for a good fit below my hip line. I also find while standing the pack tends to crinkle right above the hip which does not allow the ice to really contact the body. I love the pocket that holds the ice cube looking sheet. Overall I am happy with the product but would like to see a better way to accommodate a women's body.
2,Not great.,"I did not like this product because I think the ice coverage has huge gaps which cause parts of the effect areas not to get cold. The shoulder is a very difficult muscle to cover. If you think this will make icing easier, you are mistaken. This is according to my experience."
3,Missleading photo,"Item works as advertised; however, the picture shows coverage of the lower leg AND ankle. Item ONLY covers ankle. Just be aware."
3,Great product if it never sees a dryer,"I purchased the 12 pack. Right out of the package I used all 12 with water, then put them all in the same washer on hot. Then I put half in the dryer, and half I let air dry. Because they fit nicely without a lot of wiggle room, I didn't want to risk shrinking ALL of them, yet didn't want 12 wet mop terries laying around. Sure enough, the ones that had seen the inside of a dryer shrank noticeably. These are a great idea, but at this price they should not shrink. I want a cover that can be sanitized with bleach and a hot dryer. Heat is what kills microscopic critters, and if a white terry can't go in a hot dryer, it doesn't make sense for me to use these instead of a washable regular type mophead. Love cleaning with them, but I confess I'm disappointed."
5,SH-MOP mop covers,"This product is now produced by a different company than when I purchased it previously, but seems to be identical to the previous product. I am fully satisfied with the new supplier."
4,GREAT!!!,This book is outstanding. The characters are really life like in the minds eye. The main characters and minor characters burn themselves into your mind. The book has a lot of action in it to keep you in suspense!
3,the weakest one I've read so far,"I liked this volume of Phoenix, but felt the three different stories are not given equal weight, and a long times would go by between checking back in with one of them. Even though I found the pages of text about Japanese history interesting, they broke up the story. You can tell Tezuka was still figuring out the series. Still good over all."
4,Good? Confused?,"I liked this story, but I will understand if you do not. Let me explain.Dawn is a compelling story of a boy, Nagi, who is taken as a slave from his home, after watching the army that takes him kill every man, woman and child in his village. In a Mountain of Fire near the village lives the Phoenix. Nagi wants to kill the Phoenix and drink her blood, which gives immortality. The trouble is, many other people are also hunting the phoenix.It is possible that much of the story was lost in translation. Tezuka supposedly considered this series to be his masterpiece, but at times the writing seems awkward. The story deals with death in a very blunt way. At no time is the bloodshed gratuitous, but it can be disturbing. At the same time, Tezuka tries to break up the devestation with missplaced comic relief.Overall, the story is compelling, and leaves you wanting more. But there is an underlying awkwardness that makes me hesitant to give five stars."
4,Finally got to buy this album!!,This is a lovely moody album!Richard has a lovely voice and can generate extreme emotion from his songs.There is a great country duet with Chely Wright - The Edge Of Forever.Only hope that when he comes to the UK in May next year he brings the full band!He keeps up his tradition of writing with Fee Waybill ( of The Tubes) on Waiting On Your Love and Too Early To Be Over.Ok accept that this review is 10 years out of date - but you can ONLY review what you have heard - right?More Than A Mystery has a much rockier feel.In truth a great album - which still sounds great even now!
5,Richard Marx at his best....,"This CD is Richard Marx at his absolute best. The songs are wonderful, his voice kills me (in a good way!) and the production is perfect. For my additional two cents, the song ""One More Time"" is one of the most exquisite recordings I've ever heard in my life. Good for you, Richard!"
3,RICHARD PLAYING IT SAFE!,"All I can say about this CD is just like his last CD, ""Flesh and Bone"", Richard is playing it safe breaking no new ground! The 2 highlights are the following: ""The Edge of Forever"" sung with Chely Wright and ""Straight From My Heart"" with backing vocals by Allison Kraus. The rest of the CD is good but not pushing any boundaries. But for die hard fans, go buy it!"
5,Finnaly He Comes Back!,"The pop superstar is back (if you don't know the story ask your mom) with an new album and he's better than ever. This is a great cd, my favorites are Days In Avalon, More Than A Mystery, Almost Everything, and Too Early Too Be Over. If you know the song ""This I Promise You"" by 'N Sync, you've probally heard of his name, if you're a fan of roxette or bon jovi you might like this cd, go buy it!"
3,Handsome but not sturdy,It has to lean against a wall to hold books but I like the look and the price. I am not sure it is safe enough around kids though since it's kind of shaky.
3,Nice bookshelf and easy to assemble,"Gave it a 3 because I expected color to be more 'brown' oak color. Turned out to be more 'orange' oak color.But, bookshelf is nice..."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"II like the product because I use it for some time, YOU ARE IN SPAIN AND HAS GOOD PRICE AND SERVICE IS VERY FAST"
3,Not much fragrance to it.,"This deodorant I was hoping had a stronger fragrance that it did. I use CK One deodorant from Calvin Klein and that has a nice smell and a bit more fragrance to it without being overwhelming. This deodorant is ok, but I will stick with the Calvin Klein one."
5,A recognised masterpiece,"Paul Langford's book still remains the definitive work on the Marquis of Rockingham's first ministry. Detailed, thoughtful and well-written, it is a masterful insight into mid eighteenth-cetury British politics from one of the period's most distinguished contemporary historians."
2,Nothing but politics,"Having read Michael Holt's book The Poltical Crisis of the 1850s, I am astonished at his dismissal of slavery as a major cause for the American civil war. Holt briefly addresses the slavery argument, but only as a counterpoint to his own thesis. For Holt, it is not slavery but rather the actions and misdeeds of politicians who ultimately bring about war. Certainly politics and policy-makers steered the nineteenth century to 1861, but a handful of men did not alone divide America. To point to Abraham Lincoln's presidential election and the Southern states subsequent succession as an indication that poltics explain the coming of the civil war (as Holt does) is like blaming World War II on the assassin of the Austrian archduke. Precipitants are all too often confused for causes. Holt does provide great insight into the politcal dynamism of the nineteenth century, but ultimately falls short of a persuasive argument."
2,Stephanie J. Block is NOT on this DVD,The Emperor's New Clothes is NOT narrated by Stephanie J. Block like it says on the DVD.
2,Not very silky,"The feeling of these is closer to a sock than truly sheer hose, its a little rough feeling. Not happy with the purchase."
5,Fabulous,"These are the BEST pantyhose made, and so convenient, if you know what I mean. I wear them to work and play. My significant other likes them as well - the silky feeling and the easy access. You've got to be careful taking them off, though, or you'll wind-up with a big ball that will take a few minutes to unravel. Nevertheless, I love them and will buy more."
2,Poor Quality - Extremely Thin - Runs Appeared While Wearing the First Time,"Unfortunately, this is a product we wouldn't recommend. The quality is shoddy at best. The pantyhose thickness is extremely thin. Upon my wife wearing these the very first time - they ran while putting them on.Don't waste your time and money."
3,to thin,I found these socks thinner than the ones I purchased at REI and was a bit disappointed because I tend to love my smartwool socks. They were a great fit.
3,Wrong Item Delivered,"We ordered Smartwool Men's Hiking Light Crew, Dk Brown size S(shoe size 4-6.5) but received Smartwool Women's Hiking Light Crew, Dk Brown size S(shoe size 4-6.5). There is a problem with the links in that, when we tried originally, Women's was put in the cart although Men's was what was being ordered. Amazon was notified and appeared to have corrected the problem in that Men's is what shows up in our cart when we try to place an order. However, Women's is what we received and these are being returned.We would like to get the Men's if this is possible."
4,"good sock, but not blue","This is a great sock for people with cold feet. The pair of socks described by blue, but I received green. I don't know if the description was wrong, the shipment was wrong, or if someone is colorblind. Socks fit well and come in Small to fit women's shoe size 5-6.5"
5,Love it,"I just discovered smartwool socks this winter. I am in love with these! What a difference smartwool makes in keeping my feet warm. These hiking crew socks run alittle big but I wouldn't change the size I purchased. Some of the other smartwool socks I have seem to run alittle small for the size, but not these. I machine wash my smartwools and hang to dry."
5,Best socks ever!,"I love Smartwool socks for many reasons. They are so comfortable and keep feet warm and dry in all different temperatures (which also means they keep feet from getting stinky). They are very well made and will last for years. These are more on the heavy side so they are better for cooler weather. They provide great cushioning while hiking, but I wear them with tennis shoes for running errands on a more day to day basis too. The color of these is more of a teal even though they are described as blue. Color isn't a big deal to me as I wear them with long pants, but the teal is pretty. These socks are definitely worth the price you pay."

1,Atlan Formularies,"I ordered Mr Saxon's 2 DVD set from [...]. The DVD set contains all of his CDs which contain all of his books plus a ton of other neat stuff.One month, Three phone calls, and innumerous E-Mails later I still have not received my order. Each time I have talked with them I have been assured the product has been sent but they will resend the order at no extra charge to me. They provided a USPS tracking number which when intered into the USPS web site generated an invalid number error.I'm very sad to report, 'order at your own risk'!"
5,Good book,I bought this for my 11 year old niece and she read it in one weekend. Then she asked me for another book. Any book thats nonfiction that will encourage a child to read more deserves five stars.
4,Delightful for young people,"I found this book an excellent resource for young people or those with no background in a related field. The book is delightfully composed and illustrations are excellent. I personally feel there is some disconnect between the amount of information covered (which is very good) versus the sentence structure (which seems a little condescending to me). I had hoped to give this book as a gift to reasonably sophisticated people who are from unrelated disciplines. However, the text made that inappropriate for my use."
5,"Real chili,as it was meant to be","I grew up with this book which I bought as a signed first edition when I was 12. This is the real stuff--no tomato, onion or beans. And it isn't all about chili. There are other stories, including ones about Elizabeth Taylor, chuck wagon cooking and an elderly tamale king (whose tamales I grew up with as well). Frank Tolbert's stories beautifully recreate time, place and best of all, taste for me. This isn't a recipe book, in that it gives a list of ingredients and how to put them together. But the method of producing an outstanding bowl of red is so well described, both as to quantities and methods, that anyone who knows his or her way around a kitchen can easily become an accomplished chili cook."
3,Cliff notes on naval warfare....,"With so few titles that cover the scope this book has, it is a shame that more details could not be added. While I enjoyed the Russo-Japanese war, and WWI sections, I found the WWII sections very lacking. My recommendation, if you have books that specifically cover the battles, skip that chapter. Otherwise it is a good primer for the less known sea battles of this century."
3,Naval Battles of the Twentith Century,"If you are looking for a quick overview of the important naval battles of the twentieth century, this book is a good place to start. If you want a detailed description of these battles complete with charts and ship movements, forget it. In addition, several glaring errors indicate that the book was rushed to print without adequate proof reading. I rate it satisfactory but certainly not outstanding. There are better works on this subject out there."
1,not satisfied,This purchase was a disappointment. Although we followed all the instructions the leaves all fell off in a short time. The plant died shortly after that. Would not purchase this product again.
4,A Tight Squeeze,"The quality of this citrus press is very good - heavy guage stainless steel, restaurant quality. I just wish that it were a bit larger. It works well for small limes, but it takes extra steps to get all the juice out larger limes and lemons."
3,Not the solution to your squeezing needs,"The Nor Pro looks nice, but it doesn't quite do the job it should in getting all the juice out of a lemon. The handles flex when you squeeze hard, which prevents the force from being applied to the lemon. It seems fairly durable, but I get the feeling that the hinge will give out sooner or later."
4,does a good job,This press did a good job. I do wish the bowl was bigger so it would fit the larger lemons and limes. I have found I need to cut the ends off and then cut them in half before squeezing. It is a good product for it's size and price.
3,Great for limes- use safety glasses with lemons...,"Use it alot for limes- without problem.With large lemons, however- I frequently have had juice shoot out the sides,including one gusher straight into my left eye. Not fun...."
2,Extra long handles? Ha!,I bought this item based on the good reviews. Have been only using it a week. The handles are not extra long for better leverage. If you don't have enough hand strength you will soon tire of this device. You have to cut the lemons into quarters and not halves. It will not turn the halves inside out. A rim forms that keeps you from pressing all the juice out so you have to flip it over and repress. Cutting the fruit into quarters works but if you are not careful you will get misted by the lemon spray. So squeeze slowly. For what I paid for this I could have purchased a citrus juicer for a little extra. I'm putting this thing in the drawer as soon as my electric citrus juicer arrives. Backup only!
2,Muscle power,"My husband has to use this because I can't squeeze it and I'm not particularly weak so from that point of view it is of no use to me but my husband likes it.I guess on a more positive note, it's one less job for me to do if we're going to get full value from our investment!"
4,norpro stainless-steel citrus juice press,"This is a great product. It can be used to juice lemon and limes. It is a little on the heavy side, but it is very efficient and works really well."
3,"A Fair Tool, But...","I have used this tool many times for squeezing lemons and limes (it's too small for oranges) and it seems to be fairly sturdy with a stainless-steel finish that holds up to the dishwasher. However, it doesn't seem to close on itself as much as it should, leaving too much room (and juice) between the two halves. I found that by leaving an already-squeezed fruit in place when I insert the next one, it makes up the gap and yields more juice. Also, by cutting a shallow X across the fruit's cut end, extending through the peel, it helps the fruit to crush in the right direction. Beware of squirting juice!"
3,"Nice, but not the expected quality","Purcahsed this as the painted aluminum one I had was chipping. It looks really nice and works as expected, but there are some quality issues. First the handles don't line up together perfectly - not a big problem. More importantly, after a few uses the pivot pin fell put and could not be put back in and tightened as it was too short. The seller (LUCCA) would not replace it as defective. I ended up going to Home Depot and buying 1-1/2"" 10-24 stainless bolt and a stainless lock nut to replace the pivot pin (you really need a 1-3/8"" bolt, but I did not bother cutting it down). This resolves the issue, but considering the price of the item, it should not have been necessary to do a repair. If you are considering purcahsing this, it is better than the aluminum ones, but be warned it may come apart and don't buy one from LUCCA."
1,"Hate to be the spoiler, but mine was garbage.","Opened it out of the box and the pin connecting the upper & lower handles was dangling out of place. Impossible to even consider using it; upper & lower handles disconnected. Tried to replace the pin but to no avail.Appears to be chrome-plated rather than stainless steel, though I am not a metallurgist.Sending it back ASAP. Be careful. Maybe the manufacturer & specs for this distributor has changed?"
1,Believe the Naysayers--This Broke on Second Use,"On the second lemon, this thing broke. Manufacturer used thin metal at the hinge, so the pin came out, rendering the press useless. Not only that, but when I first took it out of the package, I was surprised to find that the press wasn't as solid as the price would suggest. The price is too expensive for this lightweight piece of metal, even if it had not broken. Buyers beware!"
5,Six months and lemons still taste terrible,"Until this purchase we had to squeeze lemons and limes by hand. We thought, 'There has to be a better way!' And here it is. It's been six months since we purchased this and it's still going strong being used at least once a day on lemons. It cleans nicely in the dishwasher and works great. People who are complaining about bending this juicer need to lay off the protein powder because it's pretty tough."
3,Poor construction but gets the job done,"The hinge that holds the upper and lower halves of the press is loose so that the two halves don't line up very well. This does not affect the performance of the product, but I would have liked to have seen better craftsmanship from it."
1,I am very disappointed in this product!,"First of all, it should have been stated that it is made in China! It is VERY VERY heavy and hard to handle. There are not enough holes, nor are they places strategically to completely drain the juice of the lemon or the orange. I fear the S & H costs of returning it, so I am forced to keep this useless product. I could have bought a better design, in my local Mexican store, but I fear the metal with which it is made. Now I fear the stainless steel metal of this product because it comes from China, who in my estimation, produces things of dubious quality."
1,NOT FOR ORANGE JUICE,"This squeezer is poorly designed and too small to juice oranges. It needs to be larger around and shallower. I have a somewhat similar lemon juicer which gets an incredible amount of juice out of a lemon so I had high hopes for this. It's expensive, especially since it doesn't do the job. I can't quite figure out all the 5 star reviews. The do show it with a lemon and a lime so perhaps it is not meant for juicing oranges."
1,$24 after it being made in China??,"I understand that things are made cheaply in China, that is why there is no production in America. But $24 for a simple thing like this, after it being made in China????"
1,MADE IN CHINA???????,"That is exactly what is wrong with this country. No wonder the unemployment is so high, and many Americans can hardly afford to put gas in their cars or food in their kids mouths. I researched this product on the Norpro website and it made me believe I was buying an American made product. Everett Washington.? since when was Washington located in China? The residents of Everette must be proud. I could have saved money and purchased at Walmart if I wanted to support China's economy.I will not purchase another Norpro product."
5,Spend a little more - get the Norpro!,"I have bought others, they break. I have used my Norpro juicer a LOT. This thing is super strong and made to last! if you juice lemons or limes much, you really need to get this!"
5,High Quality Citrus Press,This citrus press works very well. The design affords an excellent yield of juice. It feels very sturdy and well manufactured. I can highly recommend it.
3,Mediocre lemon press,"Initially, this lemon press looked like it would work well. The all metal press is strong enough to get all the juice out without having problems with the handles bending or weakening. However, the hinge is poorly designed. It comes undone every time I use it and I have to make sure that the two halves of the press and the hinge pin exactly align or it won't work. Maybe I got a bad one, but this hinge coming undone every easily drops this from a 5 star to a 3 star rating at best."
5,Get lots of juice.,"It is great. it is the one recommended by America's Test Kitchen on PBS. I like it. Here is a tip from the Test Kitchen, put the lemon half in backwards and you'll get even more juice. Dishwasher safe and I have used it alot already."
