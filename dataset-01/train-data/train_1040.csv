1,Doesn't fit the miter slot,"This looks like a good thing, but it is too large for both my Hitachi Table saw and my Inca Bandsaw -- maybe the miter slots on the metric equipment are narrower than the US standard. If so, the description should say so.The expandable nuts, which are supposed to tighten the insert in the miter slot look pretty flimsy, and are engineered so that there is pressure to pull the insert out of the miter slot as you tighten them. Even if I could get the insert into the miter slot, it doesn't look like it would stay if I tightened down the nuts to hold it.I'd pay the money to get a better featherboard."
3,Hard to Keep in the Mitre Slot,"I bought this featherboard to use on my router table. Unfortunately, tightening the hold down clamps has the tendency of forcing the body of the featherboard up out of the mitre groove on my table. As long as you don't tighten too much you're OK. Otherwise, a little pressure and ... POP! Out it comes!"
3,"Limited Range, Otherwise a Good Idea","I have one of these and the first time I went to use it, it wouldn't get close enough to the blade in my JET left tilt saw to hold the work. I ended up making my own out of wood for that situation. It does work well when your workpiece is wide enough, but if you are ripping thin strips off wide stock, the widest part of your work belongs on the fence side of the blade to prevent kickbacks and allow you to use your bladeguard. The slots in the cleats on this featherboard won't let you slide it much closer than 2"" from the blade. If they would extend the adjustable range, this would be a five star item for those of us too busy (lazy?) to make homemade featherboards"
4,Poor fit until I used the Dremel tool on it.,"The relief area where the two mounting screw holes are was too tight and would not allow the insert to sit flush. Used the dremel to open up the area a little bit and now it slips right in place. It could be due to variations in the saw, 10"" Deltas aren't exactly ""high precision"" machines. Any way, it fits now and serves it purpose. The price was worth not going through any aggrevation of trying to make one."
4,Excellent British r'n'b!,"Art Wood (guitarist Ron Wood's less famous brother) fronted this British mod r'n'b act in the mid-60s. Their sound (distinguished by Art Wood's gruff vocals and Jon Lord's nimble Booker T.-like organ lines) was sure-footed and tough through relentless club gigs in the UK. Like other organ-based UK combos like the Graham Bond Organization, their main strength was their awesome instrumental prowess but not top-notch songwriting ability ('Art Gallery' is comprised mostly of soul and r'n'b covers). This fated them to relative pop obscurity and footnote status to late-60s supergroups like Deep Purple and Cream. But the recorded documents they left behind define an era. 30+ years later, they still sound exciting; their rhythmic drive on tracks like ""Keep Lookin'"" and ""Be My Lady"" is undeniable. No collection of 60s r'n'b from either side of the Atlantic is complete without it."
4,no title,"It is amazing that the woman who wrote the novel on which this film is based is Jewish, because it is a very Catholic, very Italian film. De Niro's movies are about Italian gangsters, this one is about an Italian saint. And God. Strong acting."
4,Okay Movie,"At first I didn't know if I would like this movie or not. It didn't seem TOO great, seeing as I'm not very religious... but I was willing to try it for the sake of my favorite actress, Lili Taylor. I knew that her previous work had been very good (like her roles in Dogfight and Short Cuts) so I decided to try it. And I was surprised. It was better than I thought it would be, but not as great as I hoped. However, the fact that I am not really a strong religious person may have swayed my liking to this movie. If you are relious, I suggest this movie to you. But if not, please don't waste your time... it may not be to your liking."
1,What?,I was surprised when I got this game. I thought it was supposed to be a brain game. I guess I missed the part where it said it was for preschoolers. Way too easy for anyone over 5.
4,Good game program.,"The games in More Brain Games are definitely challenging. They're a little hokey and there is little positive reinforcement, short of scores that you can keep on the toughest set of games and only on that set, which is why I give it only four stars. But it does keep you playing, determined to figure out how to get to that seemingly impossible top score. If you're looking for brain ""therapy,"" this will give your mind the workout it needs, but a Brain Spa it isn't."
3,"Helpful, but not a cure all","This CD has 10 different games that are supposedly brain and memory boosters. There are a few that I think do something for you, but it's hard to measure as it depends on the speed of your computer, how fast you can move and click the mouse rather than how fast you comprehend. My favorite game is probably the phone dialer. I think it's the most challenging game in the pack. The user interface is somewhat arcane, and the program take a while to load. I wish you could use the number pad on the keyboard instead of doing everything via mouse, but that's just wishful thinking. It's isn't bad for the price and I think it helps, but it's not a cure all."
4,A fun way to spend an hour and exercise your mind,This software was easy to install. The Terms and Conditions of Use are very clearly stated. I found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me. The puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood. My one wish is that there were more varied games included.... But it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging...
2,not too brainy,maybe my problem is that i never played the original brain games. for the most part these games are good for clearing out the cobwebs -- testing memory and the speed of your eye to hand and then the agility of your mouse. Nothing too challengeing.
5,Does your brain need help?,I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He uses it everyday and says it really makes you think. I need to try it!
4,good quick game,"This is good for in between things, like taking a small break from really intense work. I would have liked high scores in each module, and of course, the types of games I'm least good at should be off the CD.:)"
4,Fun,"It's a fun product. However, there are only 10 games and you quickly find a way in each to do well."
5,Good workout,"This squeeze ball proved to be an effective hand workout. Just be careful when you inflate it- my dad inflated mine with a shop air compressor, and he blew it up to the size of a soccer ball. I was able to let out some air to bring the ball back to palm-size, but it's a bit floppy. It still does it's job though."
5,Pretty Cool,I like the weight of it and use it as a stress ball at work. I had a boxer's fracture in my left hand it has really put some strength back in my grip.
2,Inconsistent quality,There are some mixed feelings on this product. I love this product if it holds air. I have ordered 4 of these so far and 2 of them didn't hold air that includes the last order. I'm debating to return and order another one or just forget about whole thing.
2,Good for collectors only,I've been wanting to hear this since 1985 just because of Ginn and Dukowski playing on it. Maybe there is pure genious in this jam or maybe it really is just 5-6 musicians purposely trying to annoy the people waiting for Black Flag to play by playing as annoyingly as possible and making absolutely no attempt to create spontaneous songs. The production is really good but I just wish that there were something resembling an actual song here. Play this when you want company to leave. It's pretty cool to listen to once because it documents what these guys were trying to do.
4,Excellent replacement blade for Miter Saw,"I'm using this blade as a replacement to the one that came with my Makita SCMS. The quality of the cut is as good as you could ask for. I've cut red oak, white oak, pine and (8/4 x 8"" wide) hard maple with it. No bogging and no chip out with any of them.This blade deserves 4.5 stars. I'm taking .5 away because there's some vibration on startup until the blade is up to full speed, then it settles down. I don't know if its the saw or the blade, but it didn't do it with the stock Makita blade.I recommend this blade without hesitation."
5,Great 50's music,Saw these guys on the PBS show. Shangri-la wowed the crowd and me also. This CD is very enjoyable. This was my father's music and I can understand why.
1,What a rip off!,This same book was published by the US Army Missile Command in the early 1990s and handed out for free!
2,"Not a medical journal, but still fun","Flash is a funny guy, in his own dry humor kind of way. However, if you bought this thinking you would get some medical info, you will be disappointed. The book is barely funny enough, but really short on info. The part on poison oak really wasn't funny as maybe he though it would be either(its not that I was offended, it just wasn't that funny). As a motorcycle instructor and mentorship group ride facilitator I expected a bit more substance.Let's be safe out there."
3,It does the job,"These aren't bad at all, It is a good choice if you want a standard replacement. I'd recommend it ."
3,too small,"This would be my 4th pair of this show over a period of 12 years or so. Obviously I like them and find them comfortable as a around the house shoe. This pair is smaller then past ones, despite being the correct size 11. In keeping with the trend that has been going on for some time now, manufacturers of many products are charging more and delivering less, but the homes and the yachts they own, I notice, continue to get bigger. Curious."
5,came in,came in earlier so happy would buy again from and it was in graet condtion no scratchers or damge thankful .
3,It dose not look like the picture shown.,I have a Super Nintendo that I bout this for. In the picture it looks long to where you can use it with your hands. I one they sent me you have to use a drill or a bit driver to use it. But I can say it dose work.
1,"cant open n64 systems, and possibly snes and nes.","yes it can open GAMES< but as the title says for the product ""open systems"", I DONT THINK SO LIERS..... not long enough!!"
1,Terrible,"Doesn't work,when I try to unscrew my SNES screws it just slides back up and I can't do anything about it."
2,Does not work on Virtual Boy,"The description is wrong - this is not long enough to reach the two deepest holes of Nintendo Virtual Boy. I suppose I will keep it since it is otherwise OK quality and may come in handy for other game systems. I will attempt to alter this one with a dremel to see if I can make it work on the Virtual Boy.**Update**I used a Dremel to cut away part of the fat hex head where it first meets the shaft in order to make it skinny enough to fit into the 2 deepest holes of the Virtual Boy. This worked. I was able to open it up, remove the one defective LED assembly, reflow the ribbon cable using the heat of a hair dryer, applied a lot of pressure, and now I am back in business with a perfect display."
3,Don't buy for N64 cartriges,"I saw reviews saying it works, and I saw reviews saying it didn't. I wish I had listened to the second group and found something else, because it is indeed too big to fit in the well around the screw. I'd have to cut out a bigger hole on my cartridge to use this. I can't comment on its effectiveness for other systems, but mine at least is worthless for N64 games.Edit: Apparently I need work on my reading comprehension. The title does mention that it's only for master system games, and for the console itself on other systems. I've updated my review to 3 stars, because while this might get the job done, it doesn't seem particularly well made."
1,Poor quality,Very poorly machined and manufactured. The teeth on the bit are too large for the screws and does not fit very well. Look else where if you want a quality tool.
5,Did the job,We needed this to open up an old N64 and it did the job just fine. We were able to remove all the screws and remove the case off the N64 console. We didn't have stripping issues that were mentioned in other reviews.
5,4.5mm screwdriver,Exactly as advertised and works well.Would highly reccommend to others.If you need one of these this is the place to get it.
2,Virtual boy is wrong,"I thought this bit would go down to the deepest screw in the virtual boy but it isn't long enough to reach the deepest two, it gets stuck if you try"
1,"Strips easily, not exact fit","Many people that write the bad reviews for this product think that this is for the NES/SNES/N64 GAMES, but this is for the consoles ONLY. But even considering that, this bit is made poorly.I used it to open my SNES and it barely fit on the screws. In addition to that, the bit is now stripped and I can't use it anymore, it just slips off any screw."
1,Wrong bit,"I got a short black bit, not the long silver bit pictured above. Very disappointed, thou I was able to get the job done."
3,Works as intented with some flaws.,"I bought this to open Genesis games and for that purpose it works great, but it is too wide to open the SNES games I tried. This item should not be advertised as an SNES gamebit as it is too wide for that purpose."
2,Good only if you need it for one or two uses.,"Metal seems far too soft, mine stripped after the 2nd screw. If you are using it to unscrew a SNES or Super Famicom, DO NOT use a drill with it! Not only did it strip the bit but also the screws themselves. Genesis games however can easily be opened by hand with this."
3,So-So Overview,"This Playmate review is completely humdrum, full of the usual blase blondes who by this year in the magazine's publication were the tedious norm--with one outstanding tiebreaker: The glowingly beautiful Afro-American Idahoan, Renee Tenison. This is a matter of personal opinion, of course, yet to me it seems amazing that since the nineties Playboy has been so utterly bogged down in the synthetic blonde syndrome that it ignores, with only a few exceptions, the beauty of more natural-looking and, yes, often the darker-skinned women. The ""big bazoom"" fixation was also rearing its head by this time, giving rise to the not-much-later horde of artificially ""enhanced"" women who are sometimes so absurd-looking they're jokeworthy.Overall, other than the aforementioned glimpse of the classy Miss Tenison, I would say this particular review was a waste of my money. I kept some shots of Renee and tossed the rest in recycling."
2,Not to Hot,"3D effects are mainly still shots, I was disappointed. I am a sucker for war movies. I have some of the items shown in the movie."
3,"The film is very disappointing however, it's rather interesting!!","Surprise! surprise! I am a senior and never new 3d was instramental in the war. If, nothing more i truly believe the film is worth the $20 bucks. The existing reviews sum up the value of the film very well."
5,"A true ""resident evil"" in 3D. You must see this 3D DVD!","All I expected from this DVD was just a collection of historic 3D pictures and film footage. What I experienced was much, much more surprising and unexpected, as I was impacted both intellectually and emotionally. The ""3D"" elevated the material from mere historical footage to a virtual time travel experience, one could almost sense what it was like to be there. Seeing Hitler in 3D made me shudder, extreme evil comes disguised as the benign. Seeing the people in crowds cheering and responding to him in 3D was bone chilling. Could it happen again? My only complaint is that it was too short. I understand the limited amount of 3D material available, however they might have included more pictures, recently released, of the Allied efforts in stereoscopic photo reconnaissance. I truly recommend viewing this DVD, especially with your children, a real horror film with relevancy today."
2,More like a supplement to a bigger production,"A lot of what you watch in this offering is someone else wearing 3D glasses looking at a monitor telling the off-camera host how amazing the photos are. And that's what this is, a collection of black and white 3D photos on video in 3D with one very short motion segment of some soldiers loading a cannon/gun.I think a book in 3D would have made more sense.And it's all under 45 minutes."
1,"Very, very bad 3D","3D very poor. The main menu page with inverted 3D effect in the background (check in your TV switching left/rigth images), and the BW photos with a lot of ghosts. Only correct 3D in the color new footage. I'm surprised that a 3D producer can release such kind of bad work"
2,dvd length and quality so so,"This DVD looked like it promised more than it delivered. This was a gift to myself, There is only one segment in the video which is 3d of WW2 content.The rest is commentary on pictures which are 3d photos."
2,Misleading description,Very bad 3d quality. It is not very educative eaither. There are some pictures of Hitler - mostly still pictures. It was difficult to sit through the entire DVD.
5,A VERY GOOD BR DVD IN 3D,A MEMORABLE RARE PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICE. WE SEE VERY RARE FOOTAGE THROUGH THIS FILM. STUDENTS AND CHILDREN SHOULD SEE THESE DOCUMENTARIES.AUDIO WAS BAD
3,Read reviews before buying,"Very very few combat scenes. This is a documentary about 3D before, during and after WWII. The development of 3D and its uses.This is NOT what I expected. I wish I would have read reviews before buying. However, I did find it extremely interesting. Had I known all this, I would NOT have paid $14-15 dollars for it.I hope this helps someone."
3,WWII,"The blu ray was sweet. 3D origin and anything in 3D is cool especially WWII. $10 for a 3D blu ray is not bad, but only 40 mins long.I'd give it 3/5 stars"
1,Nothing in 3D for this movie,"This is merely a documentary film about the German's technology in using 3D photography in the second World War for the military purpose. The DVD is not in 3D at all; Moreover, it is black and white with very coarse and grainy pictures. Only some commentary scenes are color and in blue ray. This DVD is poor and far below my expectation."
5,"Brother loved it,, 3d is good he said,,","What they did was take the OLD TYPE hand held Viewer that used the Double Pictures and set them for 3D. He was impressed.. I didn't see it yet.. He says it wasn't really about War, more about 3D.. -Roy M"
1,"CAUTION!! This is just 3D pictures, its not a movie","I expected this to be a movie, or a compilation of movie clips from WWII. It is not, even though its listed as a movie it it just a flipbook of 3D photos.I paid $9.99 and feel I was ripped off. You definitely shouldn't be paying any more than that!"
1,Do not waste your money,Its not what you think it is. Its not WWII in 3-D. It just talks about how even in those days 3-D was available and was used for propaganda during WWII. It has almost no video just a handful of stills. There might be a moment or 2 where you see some 3D.
4,Comes to life in 3D,There is a short restored 3D video from the actual time period covered which was very interesting. Lost 1 star because some of the footage becomes repetitive at one point.
3,Good description; suspense,"Colonel Patterson was quite a sportsman and wrote in an informal style about his experience in ridding the Tsavo area of Kenya of at least two man-eating lions that had taken and consumed hundreds of workers on the Uganda railroad project where he was an engineer during the construction. Patterson created a good descriptive narrative that deals with the subject lions in the first half of the book and devotes the rest to tales of his hunting trips for other big game in Africa. His approach is matter of fact, devoid of hyperbole and compelling reading."
4,My bedtime story when I was a youth.,"Yep....my father loved this book and so read it to me every night, grisly chapter after grisly chapter, and got down on the floor to act out the lions howling, elephants thumpeting, and what I reckon was Pap's interpretive dance of the Masai. Yessir--I was just a kid, unable yet to read, and this sort of grotesque foolishness scared the daylights out of me. I soon got to where I would rather take a good flogging then be read another chapter of ""Maneaters."" Well, as an adult and Pap now long dead, I hold these memoiries dear and bought the book after the fictionalized movie was released. Get ""Maneaters."" It is the real thing with the bark left on. Ted Franklin Belue"
5,Colonial Perspectives,"After seeing the actual stuffed Tsavo lions at Chicago's Field Museum (Field alone is worth the trip to Chicago), I purchased the 40 page excerpt from Patterson's book from the museum gift shop. Apparently, it is the portion of the book dealing with the hunt. Fascinating. I was particularly interested in Patterson's victorian colonial perspective. Even without the portions of the book about the mutinous workers, you can pretty easily figure out that all was not well-- despite the attacks, he doesn't ever arm his Indian crew members (whom he refers to as ""coolies,"" in classic colonial fashion). I would highly recommend the pamphlet, and I am buying the rest of the book, and looking forward to devouring it (pun intended)."
4,Fascinating biography,"The attack by a wild animal on a human being carries with it a certain morbid fascination and ""The Maneaters of Tsavo"" is one of the best documented and most famous of such man-beast encounters. Upon reading Peter Capstick's ""Death in the Long Grass"", one realises the sheer number of individuals who have lost their lives to the lion. I think that the movie should have adhered to the true details and eliminated the unnecessary embellishments. It was a treat to read of these encounters with the ""Maneaters of Tsavo"" and to understand a little more of the author."
5,Hubby's Fav Author,One of my husband's favorite author. He just started reading this one......but he hasn't put it down!! Thanks so much for the quick service.
2,"Unlike the ghost and the darkness, this book will bore you","When I read this book, I was horribley disappointed. I thought it was exciting like the movie. But it wasn't. Don't waste your mone"
3,Colonials at their best,"If you read ""Man-eaters of Tsavo"" as a historical story, one that tells you about how the first British pioneers started to live in than British East Africa, than it is truly a nice source. I guess it also liberates a ""deja-vue"" feeling among hunters - even though this is rather the sad part of the book. The author, J.H. Patterson, a passionate hunter (or ""Sportsman"" as he calls himself), must have shot dozens of beautiful lions, rhinos, impalas, hippos,... during his short time in Kenya - it is frightening to think about how many more were shot just for pleasure by all the other colonials. Maybe ""the hunter became the hunted"" - but with quite uneven means for defense. I am glad, todays visitors of Kenya shoot the animals with cameras instead of guns! The first part of the book is quite exciting, but the second half, after the man-eaters are killed, is rather boring. Still worth reading if you want to know about Kenyas rather recent history in an entertaining way."
4,A little Dissappointing,After reading Man Eaters of Kumaon and The Man-Eating Leapord of Rudraprayag by Jim Corbett this book was not nearly as exciting. It was still interesting but not the same nail biting bone chilling suspense and realism of the Corbett books.
3,Almost there.,"Ok, I read this after having read 'In the Long Grass' by Capstick, and the result was obvious. This book is not even half good compared to the other one.I must say I found it a bit boring sometimes.The description of the lions of Tsavo is interesting, but a bit shallow. Even if you have seen the movie based on this book (The Ghost and the Darkness), you find it more exciting.A book is, most of the time, a hundred times better than the movie, so this is probably the exception that confirms the rule. The book is too 'cold'. It looks you are reading a financial report. 'Today we saw 2 lions - stop. They eat 2 men - stop'.Big lack of passion in it."
4,Really Good Book,"I knew that the movie ""The Ghost and the Darkness"" was based on a true event, so a little research led me to this book. 99% of the book is a really good read, but that 1% can distracting. All-in-all, the story, and accompanying pictures, are really interesting.Recommended."
1,I'm throwing mine out...,"The big problem with this that the straight edge does not reliably lie flat because the bottom of these clamp things surround the straightedge. This causes two things to happen. One, if you are jointing wide boards, the jig can rock, which can cause either a bad cut, or worse, binding and kickback.The second problem is that the second clamp will catch on the edge of your table saw as you feed it through unless you are really careful - again, a bad cut or binding and kickback.I'm chucking mine before I get hurt and am going to build a simple jig with surface mounted toggle clamps."
3,One of two you can use.,"This is one way you can put a joined edge on a warped piece of wood if the clamps come with an already joined piece of wood to use as a straightedge against your rip fence. Another way to join an edge is to make a sliding table jig for your mitre slot of your table saw. Holding it down tightly with your hands or with clamps will work with both set-ups, but I recommend using adjustable clamps. A good sharp saw blade should give you results close to a edge straightened on a joiner."
4,Great Collection - But ambient sounds distracting,"I don't pretend to be an expert on recordings, especially not classical ones, but I do have a fairly sensitive ear. These collected pieces are superb and very enjoyable to listen to. My only complaint about the music and recording is that on the pieces where the oboe and/or bassoon are isolated (solos) without the backing of the orchestra, the recording is so sensitive that you can hear the clicking of the keys on the soloists instruments. At higher volumes, I find these clicking noises very distracting and that they detract from the listening experience. At first I thought they were scratches or static on the CDs until I realized what I was hearing. If you think this will bother you, then you might want to try another recording. If you listen to the music softly, or don't think this will detract from the experience, then I highly recommend this set."
5,Wonderful Product,"Adding a zero cleareance substantially increased the quality of my cuts. I was cross-cutting plywood with my old Delta blade. The tear-out was surprisingly bad considering that the blade was sharpened recently. I dropped this insert in place and the tear-out was nearly gone. In other words, this thing really works.I love tools that work. Couple of other notes: The set screws work really well but they are really tight. I had to use my cordless drill to adjust them. Second, the bright yellow color is nice because it is a stark reminder of the danger zone.By the way, if you experience a lot of noise, the directions state that it is probably the blade rubbing on the insert. The solution is to widen the kerf slighty with a bit of sandpaper. I haven't experienced any noise."
5,"Great price, great quality","I bought one to try it; I will be buying more. All I had to do was adjust the screws for a tight fit. Some have criticized the noise level; remember that blades designed for exceptionally smooth cuts will contribute to the noise level because of their inherent design characteristics. If this is a problem for you, cut the initial slot using a blade with a strong alternating angle on the teeth and a wide kerf.When installing, you might have to increase the relief on the bottom; my blade was all the way down and made contact after only 1/4 turn but I didn't have to increase the relief.Personally, I'm going to buy at least 2 more; one for 45 degree angles and one for my dado blade. Exceptional quality and price."
4,"Works, but....","I had to elevate these (bought two) with the adjustment screws to allow clearance on my table saw, a Delta contractor's saw. I had to VERY slowly raise the blade into the insert because with it elevated, I couldn't slide my fence over the top of it.It did chip a little but beyond that seems to work just fine. It's quite noisy.I bought the second one for my dado stack and it works well also."
4,Just Great!,"I made a couple of ZCI's for my previous saw and I was given a few homemade ones when I got my Unisaw but these are better than any that I could make. No expansion with the weather like a couple of the others that I have; Thick, sturdy and solid. After adjusting, a VERY quick process, it fits very solidly and securely into the saw. I bought two and then, after using one for the first time, I bought two more. Very nice and I highly recommend it."
4,Warning!,"Product looks good. Warning: Don't be fooled with the ""frequently bought together"" feature on amazon. This will not work with any of the new Delta Unisaws!!!! Neither will the suggested mobile base!! It is a nice insert however if you have the right saw."
1,Does Not Fit,"First of all my opinion is that table saw inserts are a good idea. This particular one ""For Delta Models"" does not fit the Delta TS300. I recommend measuring your current insert and buying the correct size from a local woodworking dealer."
1,Don't waste your money,"I ordered one for convenience, but it was junk.IT WAS NOT FLAT!Oh well, live and learn"
3,Big Horn 10221B Push Stick,"This is a standard push stick, of relitively heavy plastic. Not to be confused with the modern versions engineered for use by woodworkers who are convinced they don't ever want their hobby to bite. I once owned a shopsmith saw, it came with a couple of push pads and a push stick similar to this one. I just wanted another like it for no apparent reason to speak of. I just wanted one like the other one that married dear old dad. What? Then you come up with your own reason."
3,"OK, But Use With Caution","The Big Horn was my first push stick. It is well shaped for the purpose, and I use mine occaisionally, but I caution that it is plastic and can suddenly slip sideways on wood. Always consider where your hand will end up if the stick slips during a cut. I have since made a wooden paddle-type push stick (15""x6""x1/2"") for the table saw, and I believe it is much safer."
1,Save Your Money,"Every kid that made it through seventh grade wood shop with a passing grade already knows how to make one of these from a scrap of wood. If you don't, then you have absolutely NO business using a table saw anyway!"
1,Dangerous Product,"this product is dangerous,I used mine for probably 8 months before it actually touched the blade,but the first time it nicked my blade it literally exploded in my hand,when it happened its one of those times that it happens soo fast your in shock for a second before you start counting your digits to make sure their all there,I was able to search around my shop and find most of the pieces(a few were imbedded in my hand)and notice that the blade just barely grazed the outside of the stick,I count myself as being very luck that I still had my blade cover on because the forward motion of the push stick being there one moment and gone the next my hand would have definately ended up in the blade,Now I cant say why this happened perhaps because I live in the desert and it isnt uncommon for my shop to reach 140 degrees with A/C off in the summer,perhaps the heat dried out the plastic but from now on I will stick with shopmade push sticks"
1,You have to be kidding,"I am convinced on this item that the reviewers all must work for the manufacturer. Talk about a $5 piece of junk. Now, if this were selling for $2, I might rate it higher. This looks and feels like a child's toy. Make one out of a piece of scrap wood and save your money."
1,You will not be happy,I got this as part of the featherboard set. It has a rounded slick end that needs a rubber footer added to prevent slipping off of materials. I had to operate on the plastic edges which were sharp and made sustained use uncomfortable.Make one yourself out of a stick and have something as good or better.I threw the featherboard away - got it as a gift.
5,Another Safety Essential,"This push stick is especially useful when running narrow stock through your table saw or jointer. I prefer the larger pad type push blocks for most applications, but they just don't work on narrow pieces. The plastic cuts easily without damaging your blade or knives, just in case you goof. For that reason, I'd keep a spare or two around.You can always buy another pushstick, but fingers......"
1,"Oooooo, not good","Inexpensive, yes, rated 5 stars by Luca Turin , yes....but to me: Smells cheap, plasticky, headachy, sharp, and not good at all. I have used it now as air freshener, and even that makes me gag."
4,Not Bad.,"I got my Order relatively quick and found it to be in decent enough Condition, it also came with Cassets which I don't have any particular Use for, but if your not trying to expand your knowledge of German and are trying to learn then you might need them, but as CDs instead. This Particular Course had a great Way of explaining Grammatical Structure with Cases and what not, which is very useful. It also has a decent Vocabulary as well as Phonetics."
3,NO CD INCLUDED - otherwise suits my needs,"The product arrived within the requisite time and in good condition. Hugo German is a traditional approach to learning a language (which suits me!)I'm on week 4 now and its starting to get interesting (although getting more difficult). But note - there is a reason that some of the products are cheaper. You guessed it - No CD. Not sure if one can get the CDs separately but I think that they are important to the learning process. Fortunately I have a friend who was able to lend them to me (where I'm from, the co"
5,Leecraft DW-2 Zero-Clearance Table Saw insert for DeWalt Model DW744 and DW746,this Table saw inset is very heavy and well fitting. It prevents dust and debris from coming back in your face.Leecraft DW-2 Zero-Clearance Table Saw Insert for DeWalt Model DW744 and DW746
3,Compatibility Warning,"A nice insert, BUT you CANNOT use it with the factory supplied splitter and blade guard on your DW744. Leecraft only offers that you fashion yourself a riving knife and epoxy it behind the blade. Hmm? Caveat emptor."
3,The Thirteenth Chair,"I enjoy reading plays, but this was a little hard to follow sometimes.The plot was interesting and turned out to be a real whodunnit!"
4,An interesting look at a unique deaf cultue,"""Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language"" is a look at the effect of a large deaf population on Martha's Vineyard. Though a dry read at times, this book gives an interesting look at how for once in the history of deaf culture the *hearing* adapted for the deaf instead of vice versa. While most people might assume that the large deaf population would force a hefty amount of deaf people to adapt to hearing life, the opposite was actually true; the brilliance of Martha's Vineyard was that nearly all hearing people knew sign language to some degree.The book analyses cultural impact of the large deaf population within the Vineyard's communities, which was biologically caused by the genetic predisposition for deafness. The book, largely written like an anthropological study, focuses on both physical and cultural aspect of the deafness in the communities. However, the most interesting implications within the book are those discussing deaf and hearing interrelations."
5,A book not to be forgotten,"There are about 10 books I've read in my life that are vivid years later. This is one of those. We're given the chance to see what it might be like to live in a place without prejudices about people being different because of something like deafness. I learned a tremendous amount about deafness, sign language, and life on a New England fishing island community in bygone years. Don't miss this wonderful book."
4,They were just like everyone else,"This book is required reading for my sign language I class. Because I'm also a scientist, I find the genetics piece about this fascinating. This book is well written with bits of humor and I've enjoyed what I've read so far"
3,"I'm a doctor, not a writer!!!","A mildly entertaining book. The author didn't fully explore the multi-faceted personality of Bones. The story is occasionally touching, but otherwise average. The author has written better books, like Crossover, and I recommend them"
3,Forgettable,"Literally. I can't remember what this book was about- about the time I finished it and put it down. It wasn'tthe worst Star Trek novel out there. But there have certainly beenplenty better.There's some interesting work with the assassins, some surprises at the end, but most of it was honestly not engrossing enough to finish, if I didn't live in a country with precious few English novels.Sometimes I think Star Trek novel authors take advantage of Trekkie love for the work, as if we'll read just anything. But there is something that first pulled us into this universe, that brings us back. Roddenberry had a hope and a dream, that surpassed even the occasional bad writing ofThe Original Series. Just as I look for good writing in any book, I look for it in a Star Trek novel. I do not think we should demean this epic myth just to write yet another pedantic work. A great story deserves great writing."
2,slowed down by long flashbacks,"It sure could have been interesting to know more about McKoys first mission and (first?) wife, and why the marriage broke up. But all these facts are told in tedious, slow paced, flashbacks or even ""confessions"" (really!)It should have been interesting to see (and feel) how McKoy would react, when he bumps into his ex-wife unexpectantly. And also the premisse of assassination as semi-religion could have been interesting to explore.So finally this book leaves you with the question: why wasn't it REALLY interesting to read about it? It just simply wasn't. This is a mediocre book, with very little of the normal grumping, or humor or friendly bantering that makes McKoy who he is.If you want to read a better book starring McKoy, read ""Dreams of the Raven""."
2,Too Dim,This product produces a light blue glow for your tank but does not produce sufficient light for a 10 gallon aquarium. You need the higher rated units; suggest going with the fluorescent or LED lighting.
1,Don't Buy,I purchased this bulb for my 1 gallon hex tank and it hardly gives off any light. You're better off to stick with a normal florescent white bulb than this one!
5,nice light,"enjoy the color of the light, long lasting and priced right. Better option than what is available at my local Petsmart"
3,The Madison Time and Filler,"I got this CD because I loved the song The Madison Time on The Hairspray Motion Picture Soundtrack (which is a great soundtrack, but the production is not great). This CD has both parts of that song plus a number of instrumentals that seem to have been cut to capitalize on the success of The Madison Time. Those songs (e.g., Split-T) and The Hucklebuck are not bad but the rest of the CD has Bryant doing very Muzak-like (or easy-listening) versions of Hollwood films. You can get The Madison Time plus other great instrumentals on Rhino's 60's Instrumental Classics CD (and the 50's Instrumental Classics one is great too)."
5,"Adds warmth, softness and manageability","Adds warm highlights to brown hair with a silky finish. If my hair color becomes too red as a result of this, I sometimes run Aveda's Black Malva through it to cool down the color."
3,Erudite but biased,"This book cites and discusses many interesting sources to support the author's thesis that almost no one in antiquity could read. Unfortunately, Professor Harris isn't fair to other points of view. For instance, in the Second Philippic Cicero says that it was customary for people to sell written programmes of gladiatorial matches at gladiatorial exhibitions. This amazing story clearly suggests a high level of literacy in First Century BC Rome, yet Professor Harris never even alludes to it, presumably because it flies in the face of his claim that almost no one could read. It just shows that this book is not a fair and balanced assessment of ALL the evidence."
4,Solid!,"You can tell these guys put great care on their products. From the packaging to the actual performance of the tool there is not much left to be desired. No vibration, smooth clean cuts. My only complain is the price."
5,What a surprise,I gave this book recommended by a friend to a girl friend and she was so thrilled with it that she gave it back to me to read. The poetry was so honest and personal and rang so true. The photos are also very well done. The author is truly an artist.
3,Listen to your iPod in your car,"It's a nice device to have - you are able to listen to your favorite songs in your car - the only downfall that I found is that the volume only goes up to a certain point - and if you want it louder it wont. It's good at it's max volume but you cannot raise the volume after you have reached that ""max""."
1,I didn't like it at all,"Belkin is known for great products, not this one.I received static with the music, no matter what empty FM frequency I found.Really disappointed with this product."
5,Very impressive!,"About a month ago I tried the Griffin iTrip, and I was immensely disappointed with the result- it was very scratchy, poor sound quality, and I had trouble finding a radio station that didn't have overlapping noise.So I gave this product a go- and I LOVE it. It works beautifully, there's no static, and you get radio-quality sound. The steel neck makes the iPod easily accessable when you're driving too.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this. The only thing I regret is buying it at Best Buy for 30 more dollars than amazon.com."
2,Decent as a charger and holder.,This product works okay as a charger and as something to hold up and support your iPod Mini. That is about all it is good for. The FM transmitter is terrible. As others have said it rarely works without some form of interference. Even when there is no interference at all I have never been able to get a stereo signal. I wrote an email to Belkin's technical support email address suggesting maybe my unit was defective or I there was something I could do to improve the FM transmitters performance and got absolutely no reply. Days later I replied to my original email with a nasty-gram and got nothing from that either. They seem to be asleep at the wheel.
3,Poor sound quality,"The Ipod sound quality itself is not stellar - a fair tradeoff for skip free music while jogging. But when the Ipod is added to the Belkin tunebase the sound is noticeably 'muffled' or 'hollow'. To this you can add the issue of in-city interferance. It becomes a far cry from the CD quality sound you expect in a car.Also, you may wish to consider do you really want to listen in your car to the same music you have been listening to at the gym or riding the bus for the past few months?"
1,This product ruined our car battery and 2 Ipods,"We tried the Belkin in one car. When we turned the Ipod on, the car battery immediately discharged (we had to buy a new car battery) and the Ipod died. We bought another Belkin and tried it in a different car and with a different Ipod (in case the first incident was a coincidence) and this Ipod died too. The Ipods were under warranty, the car battery was not. We tried this with 2 different Belkins, in 2 different cars with 2 different Ipods. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Recieved the wrong product,I can't honestly give a fair review as the product that came was not the product I ordered.
4,TIP: How to increase FM performance,"Pros:- Tight fit, sturdy gooseneck.- Line-out jack in case you have an aux/mp3 input for crystal clear sound.- Turns off ipod automatically when the ignition is off.- Charges the ipod while playing.Cons:- So-so FM transmission performance.However, I did accidentally found a trick to increase FM performance. Just connect a mini-stereo cable to the line-out jack, and the radio reception became noticeably better. This worked in both of my cars. I guess the cable acted as an external antenna for the FM transmitter. I suppose a headset will also work if you can't find a mini-stereo cable, for that matter."
2,Does not work with BMW factory radio,"I drive a 2001 BMW 325ci with a factory BMW radio (not Harmon Kardon). The Belkin will charge through the cigarette lighter but does not fit quite right, it wiggles around. When I use the attachment ring provided in the box it won't fit at all. The iPod will charge and play when in the cradle but no signal transmits to the radio. I literally spent 1.5 hours, first by myself, then with a gadget-knowledgable friend, going through every single FM frequency. Nothing but silence, even with the iPod volume turned all the way up. The iPod works fine with head phones, by the way.Granted, I may have gotten a defective Belkin, but I won't be trying another one for the simple fact that it won't even fit my cigarette lighter snugly.BMW Owners- be sure to read the return policy carefully before you buy this!"
2,Not Such a Great Product,"I bought this with the soul purpose of charging my ipod in the car - the fm transmission has lots of white noise - when using a cassette adapter via the headphone jack, eq settings are over-ridden as well as volume setting. Eventually the socket came undone and launched the fuse into the car making it unusable till I found another fuse. I now have an adapter from crutchfield that plugs directly into my cd changer controller and works (clean sound) much better as well as keeping the ipod charged."
1,Not the product that's advertised,"This product states that it is compatible, via trays, for an iPod nano as well. When I received it, this is also printed on the box several places. However, upon trying to fit my nano in the tray I found that there is no way it will fit...anyone who has a nano knows that the plug on the bottom is offset slightly. So, a mini ipod would fit perfectly as it's plug is centered. The 2 pieces were about 1/16 of an inch off and there is absolutely no way it would fit...4 of us tried!!! This was a big disappointment. I ended up going to a local RadioShack and buying the correct one. I was very disappointed in Belkin for this product as they usually put out very good items!!!"
1,Not for 30 gig ipod!!,I have no idea how well the TuneBase actually works because it is not compatible with 5th generation ipods like the product description claims it is. DO NOT buy this if you have a 30 gig 5th generation ipod!! The ipod will not fit in the tray!!!
5,Fantastic!! A must-have for any iPod owner.,"I love this thing. It works, it's easy to use, attractive, sturdy. You barely need the directions. It's clear and has increased my already insane love of road trips! My Toyota dealer not only sold me my car but sold me on this product when he saw I had an iPod mini."
1,Belkin TuneBass FM Auto Charger?FM Transmitter for iPod mini,I would not recommend this item to anyone. It ruined 2 iPods that I owned. Both units heated up and would no longer work.Luckily they were under warranty.
3,first time iron user,"Works well, but I expected something more extraodinary, a sleeker silkier hair.. coz my hair is not coarse, its just wavy and a little frizzy.. maybe I set my expectations too high.."
3,Not exactly...,Not exactly what I wanted. And certainly not what I thought I was purchasing from the picture posted with the description. But too annoyed and cheap to return/ exchange it so I kept it. Not as effective as the one I had intended on purchasing or thought I was ordering but works well enough.
4,LOGICAL,"THIS BOOK HAS VERY GOOD PICKS IN MY OPINION, THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THE AUTHOR MIGHT BE TELLING YOU SOMETHING YOU ALREADY KNOW DEPENDING ON YOUR LEVEL OF EXPERTISE."
4,Good Product,"This insert is dead flat but was just ever so slightly oversized for my PM 66. Easy fix though with a sander, just slightly sanding the edges to where it was a snug fit. I'd rather have it this way than loose fitting. Overall I'm very pleased with the insert and would recommend it to anyone. I bought two, one for my combination blade and one for my dado set."
4,Leecraft PM-1--Zero is great,"The Leecraft Pm-1-Zero is the best zero clearance insert I have ever used. It does just what it is supose to do. A good solid productDave, Michigan"
3,Okay...,"I bought this set a couple years after I got Slaughter of the Soul. I regard that album as one of, if not the best, melodic death metal albums ever. Unfortunately, these two albums hardly live up to their final album. ""The Red in the Sky is Ours"" is plagued by a nasty demo type production, and might have been better if that was different. ""With Fear..."" is better in the production aspect, as well as the musical aspect. However, the melodies are sparse, and not very effective when they show up. If your'e a huge fan of At the Gates then you might benefit from this, but otherwise it's just fairly average stuff. For the best in melodic death metal, go with ""Slaughter of the Soul""."
3,might as well just get a nerf dispite their jamming up issues,"I bought 3 of these so my husband, me, and my 8yo could have fun together. I chose them over the nerf guns because they reviewed jamming up constantly. Well....so do these. That, and the tops to the disk container have come off. Not happy. Should've just got the darn nerf my son asked for. We ended up getting one and it jammed up just like the reviews said, but guess what...my son likes it better. So, I'll just get him what he wants next time instead of trying to be clever. It didn't pay off with this item :-("
3,Matrices as many others,"Hello:It's a good book, but it's not different from others I bought to study matrix algebra. Actually, I bought it as a recommendation from another book on matrices."
3,"JUST DUMB, AND FLATOUT STUPID 6.5 OUT OF 10","Pit Fighter is one of the dumbest games I've ever played. You basically pick from three different fighters and your goal is to be the ultimate champ of pit fighting and to earn as much money as possible. The character models look nice, but the background environments are ugly. The sound and music are terrible and really bug you while you play the game. The fighting mechanics need a tune-up. And last but not least, this game feels boring. The game has enough merits like a hilariously stupid premise, some decent fighting mechanics, the abilities to pick up objects to stab or throw them at your opponent is fun and the graphics are okay. Still, you have much better options for the Genesis when it comes to games like Shinobi, Sonic and many more. Still, if you want a good laugh out of a stupid game, this one is for you."
3,From Back Cover,"Ian Danforth's new assistant was hiding something. Gorgeous Katie O'Brien was too self-assured, too haughty and too dismal a typist to be a temp. In a matter of days, Katie had Ian out of the boardroom and into the bedroom. Yet her heart remained a mystery - one he was determined to solve.Katherine Fortune was her real name - and she'd been under the thumb of powerful, controlling men like Ian her whole life. Although Ian's lovemaking made her shiver with need, what future could they have? Ian was everything Katherine wanted - but he was also everything she was running from.5th in Dynasties: The Danforths mini-series; follow-up to The Fortunes of Texas series."
2,I give it a C-,I usually like bad scary movies (I'm weird like that) but this didn't quite cut it. Save you money for a different movie.
1,The epitome of bad movie making,"This film is the litmus test for all bad movies in my collection. When I see something really awful, I can say, yeah that was a bad movie, but it was no Dead Time Tales! Bad directing, bad acting, bad cinematogrophy, bad scripting, 10 dollar special effects budget, this film has it all! It sounds like it would be so bad it's funny, but they manage to screw that up as well.Here is a tip from me, get some friends in a room and play this movie. Warn them ahead of time to avoid lawsuits later. Watch them react to the movie. It's hysterical!!! Sheild your own eyes and ears from the movie for the sake of your own sanity. No one should ever view this film more than once. Be aware that I have lost friends with doing this, so continue at your own risk."
3,three and a half stars,"there a few great songs on this CD, but some real losers as well. ""I'm So Happy"", ""Teenage Love"", Ooh Shucks"", ""Rose Marie"", ""Walkin' With My Baby"", and ""Wanna Lee"", are all winners; great doo-wop songs. But some of the other songs I can certainly live without, or even bear listening to. But the great songs account for about half of the selections on the CD."
3,"not bad, but not that great either","I really wanted to love this album, but I'm stuck just liking it. Some of the songs are pretty catchy and the guitar work is ace, naturally. But most of the songs never really catch fire and I still cannot get past how uninspiring his singing is. Sadly, his lyrics are still too reliant on cliches and don't really add up to much.So another mixed bag/less than fully satisifying effort from Bernard. Which is a real shame, actually, considering how brilliant his work with Suede was."
2,Not as Friendly,"I was very excited to listen to this CD because of my love for his first CD ""People Move On."" After many listens, I could never get into it and I had to give it to my friend who did like it more than me. In my opinion, there is no need to purchase this CD. I suggest making sure ""People Move On"" is in your collection and Suede's ""Dog Man Star."" The latter was co-written by Butler before he left Suede. Butler is without doubt, one of the top guitarist out there right now. Unfortuantely, ""Friends and Lovers"" shows that his songwriting skills are not at the same level."
2,Neat little book,"This sturdy book contains six precut stencils in a medieval theme. The pages are durable and easy to remove, and there are lots of uses for them. I used them to make more pieces for my feltboard, and sometimes I'll color them onto my windows with dry-erase markers (Instant stained glass!) The designs included are a fantastic gargoyle, a crossbowman, a great dragon, a castle, a knight on horseback, and a jester with juggling balls."
3,Stencil time...,I got this cause I wanted to decorate an old denim jacket. The stencils helped me get lots of ideas for the project.
5,For the money . . .,"For the money it is pretty tough to argue with these push blocks. They do exactly what they are supposed to - hold wood & protect digits. I have larger hands, so a larger grip would be nice, yet that may complicate things for others with smaller hands. The molded thumb indentations are helpful for applying pressure, the foam bottom cuts down on vibration and helps prevent slipping ( particularly when they are clean ) and the bright yellow color - actually helps to keep me alert beacuse of the contrast between the saw and router table surfaces. These push blocks should also work well with a jointer, although I have not purchased or tried that to date. Probably not absolutely perfect - but for the money , I do not believe you can go wrong."
2,Poor transfer to Kindle format,"while i enjoy the book.....its not formatted for Kindle properly. no active table of contents....words misspelled.....sometimes only 2 words on a line etc. ""God"" sometimes comes out as Ood...#<od etc.i almost requested my money back, but the book itself is too good to miss."
1,Kindle edition needs work,"As noted by others, there is no active table of contents. Nor is there a copyright page or a third party introduction or biographical data on the author (whose life and work are well attested to in Wikipedia).The ebook only costs $.99 but I still feel entitled to some feaures. This book is a commentary and as such should be easier to reference.I bought Gleanings in Genesis for a course and it serves my purposes. I have not noticed any flagrant typos or omissons yet."
5,What a difference!,"After purchasing the Grizzly 1023S table saw and a Forrest WWII blade, I was expecting glass-smooth cuts. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed in that I could still see the blade marks on the wood. So I decided, based on reviews for the 5"" model, to purchase this stiffener...and what a difference! Now, my saw makes glass-smooth cuts and I have no need for any further working of the cut edge. I did not notice any difference in noise, as reported by other reviewers, but my saw was pretty quiet to begin with. This was well worth the money."
1,I expected better from Forrest.,"I ordered the WoodWorker II 10"" and the 6"" Dampener. The products were shipped seperately. While the WoodWorker II has proved itself to be first class, I cannot say the same about the dampener. When I opened the dampener, I found that the label side of the dampener was covered with rust. I really expected better from Forrest given their reputation."
5,It's an axe,It's a little bit bigger than we thought it would be but it works great. We love to go camping so this was a nice addition to our supplies
5,This is the best axe/hatchet I've ever used!,"Just like the title says, it's the greatest! When I received it, it was in perfect condition. I've used it many times and have been impressed every time. It splits hardwood as well as softer woods like pine. Works great to limb a tree or split wood. Its a nice heavy duty, well made, strong piece. The sheath is very nice as well, great material and durable. It also has belt slits cut into it so you can wear it on your belt. I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Great Hatchet/Ax Hybrid,"Very nice product. Well built. Sturdy with a secure rubber grip. Has good weight to help provide a lot of force when you need it. That being said, if you are buying something to take camping somewhere that you plan on hiking to, this isn't what you want. It's more of a hatchet/ax hybrid. If you're drive up camping then you'll love the extra weight and size but you won't want this thing in your backpack for any sort of hike."
4,Awkward in-between size,"I find this to be an awkward in-between size. It's slightly too big and heavy to use with one hand, but it's a little too small to effectively use with both hands. I would definitely not take this camping opting instead for a smaller hatchet. The metal shaft between the head and handle is very thin, so if you ever need to choke up on the ax, you can't get a good grip.The construction is of excellent quality and the sheath is nice, so I'm keeping this ax. However, it remains to be seen how I use it if ever."
3,I have started to really Dislike,I have had this 6 months and have used it enough to decide I wont be using it anymore unless I have to. It is a awesome idea and sounds great to have a axe that can NOT break ever!!!! but it is too heavy to strap to your pack. and if you take it camping don't plan on keeping a fire fed in the winter with this. The handle it just too short to use with both hands and it is to heavy to use with one. I can not recommend this. If it had a longer usable handle it would make it better.
2,"HUGE! Not a backpacking hatchet, by any means!","If you take this on a 3 day hiking trip, you might be a goober, but you'll definitely be sick of carrying it. Just saying...I think its to small to call it an axe, but bigger than any hatchet I've ever seen. Should have gone to Lowe's and bought the one in the hammer isle. Well, after sending this thing back, that's what I did, but I wish I would have done it first."
4,"Great art, evolving humor","Fans of the currently syndicated newspaper strip will find through this collection that Citizen Dog has been through some changes since its origin. If nothing else, O'Hare is a superb artist with a flair for both motionless and kinetic moments. His draftsmanship sustains the strip. At this point, however, the humor is much more slapstick than verbal or intellectual. Many of the gags are Tex Avery-esque, or harken back to vaudeville days. That's an interesting style in itself, but as humor, it pales in comparison to the current incarnation of the strip. Those who think the artistic side of cartooning and gag writing is in decline, however, need look no further than this book for a spirited refutation."
3,just... OK,Cheap price. Cheap quality. These work well if you mount and leave them in place. They are not ment to be constantly put on and taken off.
1,Horrible,"I purchased this product to mount my Shure Sm57 to my snare drum and it failed to even hold the microphone up. The second I let go of the mic it slowly sagged until it hit the head of my snare. As for the clip part, it seemed to be entirely too small to even clamp to my drum's hoop. Overall this item was cheap and flimsy fail oils not even hold my mic."
2,CHEAP but does the job,"Be careful with these mic clips the plastic is incredible brittle!One other note, the mic clips do not detach so you're stuck with the Samson mic clips. You can't use smaller/larger mics with these clips...still, not a bad option for a '57 on the snare size."
4,Beautiful pictures,This is a great book for my kids ages 6 and 8. The picturers are beautiful and it is well written.
5,Best ever,"ok, the other guy said this was bad but he doesnt know wat hes talking about, first off the sounds is so loud i have to use the VOLUME button to turn it down, and the only reason it turns off every hour is so that it doesnt drain the battery, people dont read direction, it is all clearly stated in the manual, so next before u write a review read up on the product directions first"
3,Can't handle RW source discs,"Simple to use and does a great job when the source disc is DVD+R, but when the source disc is DVD+RW (Memorex), it doesn't copy, even when the disc has only been recorded on once."
1,"Bad product, bad customer service","The item did not work directly out of the box. When calling the company to discuss, the service department seemed annoyed by my call and was impatient in reviewing the returns policy... and even expected us to pay to ship the device to them to repair. Terrible policy."
4,The bible for addicts of MGM!!,What a great book!! I've owned three copies over the years. If only people would return things!! ;). A good buy!
4,"Excellent dado, not perfectly accurate","The Forrest 6"" x 24-Tooth Dado Set cuts perfect dados without a doubt. The problem is, mine is not perfecty accurate. For 3/4"" it calls for both outside blades and 4 - 1/4"" chippers. When I put this configuration on, it is not 3/4"". I have to use the plastic shims. For [the price], this is not acceptable in my book. I don't know if I just got a bad set or if this is the way they are made. Besides that, the cut is nothing less than perfect...."
5,My first handgun case.,"I have a Ruger SR40. I purchased the 11"" case and it fits like a glove. Could fit an extra mag in there if I wanted. The padding seems very thick, the logo looks great and the case makes me feel like my gun is very safe and protected. Great value!"
5,Ruger case,"Bought this for my 22/45. Fits perfectly. But I added a red dot sight and will also get the 15"" to store it assembled.I wish the logo was on the other side so that I can unzip it with the logo up and show the empty chamber when I check in. Slots for 1 magazine would also be nice. Not a big deal. Great workmanship."
5,Rueger Embroidered Handgun Case,"A very nice embroidered case that I purchased for a Ruger Single Six with a five and a half inch barrel. It looks as though it will work fine for a six inch barrel. Any longer than a six inch barrel, I would recommend that you consider the next size up. Workmanship is good."
5,A great product for Ruger handgun owners,"This Ruger Embroidered Logo Handgun Case is very attractive, well made, and provides excellent protection to my Ruger handgun. It is also highly functional, with plenty of room for two speedloaders along with my revolver. The addition of a handle to make it easier to carry would be nice, but the lack of a handle is not enough to deduct a star in my rating."
4,changing battery,"I've had this watch for 4 years now and it's great and fun. However, like all things, it's time has run out and I need to replace the battery. However, I can't figure out how to remove the back plate (or if it even can be removed). Has anyone replaced the battery for this?"
3,"Cool, but doesnt quite fit me....","I bought one from the ThinkGeek website. Its a good looking watch but because of the unisex design, it would barely fit my wrist. I'm a big man and I can only wear it on the last hole. I'll probably go to a watch store and purchase a different band. Also the battery died within three days from receiving it in the mail. They said they would send another watch, so I'm still waiting on that. The instructions say that the battery should last a year under normal usage."
4,big,"The watch is fun to play with, and keeps the hex skills up, but it is big and clunky. The LEDs are bright enough to be daylight readable, which also occasionally causes problems indoors. Seems to be reasonably accurate."
4,Brandenburg Concertos Orchestral Suites,"They are after all, the Brandenburg Concertos and Suites and thusly nothing much can be said about the content and the degree to which one appreciates their beauty. As one would expect, St Martins and Sir Marriner, perform, at minimum, flawlessly.Unfortunately, several cuts on two of the 3 CDs are poorly engineered, in terms of volume, requiring the listener to turn up the volume knob in order to hear the cut. And then remember to turn down the volume when the next cut begins.Not a deal breaker in any way, annoying non the less, and disapointing."
4,Great fun,"I hadn't had a recording of the Brandenburgs in a long time, since the LP days, and this was very welcome when it came in. In fact, it was a stressful time (aren't they all), and Bach was the ideal tonic. I'm not technical in ""getting"" the aspects of recording, but I liked the sound very much and give equal weight to modern instruments and period instruments--they both are valid to me. Nice reminder of how fine Bach's other orchestral music is, too. Happy to have been exposed to Bach in college days. While I can't say I understand him or appreciate all of it, it is unmistakeably wonderful stuff. How mysterious is the gift of music!"
4,"Goku is back, I couldn't be happier!","First of all I'd like to comment on the last review.In this DVD Goku does NOT transform into a Super Saiyan.A SSJ is when the hair turns blond, a SSJ2 is when the hair is blond and there are waves of electricity around you, a SSJ3 is when the face changes and the hair grows very long (still blond), and a SSJ4 is when the hair is black and the whole body is covered with fur except for the chest. But ignore the last one. Anyway, most of the episodes around this time were really boring, the whole Namek Saga was boring. But I really enjoyed seeing Goku return after his friends were getting their butt kicked. It's realy great when he makes a joke out of the Ginyu Force. So if you are looking for the DVD where Goku goes SSJ for the first time, this is not it. Bt it's still a good DVD none the less."
2,clear some stuff up,Most of the reviews complain that Goku isn't actually ssj in this episode. They are right. It is called super saiyan becuase Vegeta *thinks* Goku is a super saiyan. Not because he is. I only gave it two stars because the whole namek saga is very boring to me.
2,Another Poor Attempt to Capture the Spirit of Columbo,"For those of you who have watched the Columbo show for many years, you will be sorely disappointed by this book, as well as the entire Columbo series. The brilliance of the old show was the subtlety in which Columbo got things done. Here, all the subtlety is pushed to the front as the reader can barely go 5 pages without a reference to Mrs. Columbo. There is no panache in which the murder is solved. No, hard-hitting Columbo. Just boring, diffuse, loose ends, that when they come together, you wish you would have sat down and watched on of the episodes that you've already seen 20 times."
4,Very Interesting Collection,"I really liked this collection because it had some movies that were totally independent and you can tell, some fresh ideas and fearless storytelling. What a blast!!"
1,bcieclipse strikes out again,"i own many of these 10 packs and like them. this one curse of the dead isn't one of them though. i didn't enjoy one movie in this collection. i sold it as soon as i finshed it. the worst bar none. i told you so, buy at own risk"

2,huh? I have to take it apart to use it on the other side of the saw,"Other than the fact that you have to dissemble this to switch sides of the saw, its a great tool. It does get pretty annoying when you're making opposite angle cuts that you can't just flip the board over."
4,"pleasurable to take a gamble, get a payoff","If you've listened to any tune on this CD and liked it, take a gamble and buy it. You'll have the pleasure of liking 1 song and finding many more -- a sensation many of us music lovers seek. How often are we disappointed...plenty. But not this time.Try the samples here on Amazon or create a ""Trotsky Icepick"" station on Pandora. I bought this CD for Big Dreams and ended up liking 4 more tunes as much or more.And this is my only exposure to this band, so no, I'm not a rabid t-shirt wearing fan and I'm stingy compared to the typical Amazon reviewer who gives everything a 5 star and calls every songwriter a genius. Given this CD, though, I'm ready to take a gamble on another work by this band."
3,Gasket didn't fit my 1982 Mercedes Benz 380SL,"I was able to use the trans filter ,but the pan gasket didn't fit! Since my trans wasn't leaking I was able to reuse my gasket, but this was incomplete for my needs."
1,MAY NOT FIT YOUR CAR EVEN IF THEY SAID IT WOULD,"THE FILTER FIT BUT THE PAN GASKET IS FOR SOME OTHER CAR THEN WHAT I HAVE, I HAVE A 1987 560 SL MERCEDES. THE GASKET THAT CAME IN THE BOX IS TO BIG AND SHAPED WRONG? THERE (FIND PARTS THAT FIT YOUR CAR) SAID IT WOULD FIT? SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO THE DEALERSHIP AND PURCASE THE RIGHT GASKET"
4,"Genuine horror, well written","Although this is a 'vampire' story by the same guy who gave us _Anno Dracula_, the tone is very different. _AD_ was action/intrigue, with some horrific elements, but _Bad Dreams_ is out-and-out horror. The story centers on the Neilson family, all of whom are victims of 'Mr. Skinner' at one time or another; this vampire enjoys ruining lives as much as he enjoys taking them. In the search for the killer of her sister Judi, Anne Neilson enters a subculture of sex and drugs that would be nasty enough _without_ a supernatural evil hiding in it. Somewhere along the way, she gets drawn into the vampire's dreamworld; unlike a lot of stories that have used similar devices, this one manages to make the dreamworld convincing. It's not for the squeamish, but it's a good horror novel.Kim Newman trivia: this book may be unique among Newman's novels in that - as far as I can tell - it's the _only_ one in which the characters are all his own creations."
5,Pot rack hooks,"Great hooks, match the ones I already have on my potrack. Came very quickly, great service from this vender."
4,Wrought Iron Hook Medium,I was pleasantly surprised by the good quality wrought iron and price of this item. I ordered the hooks as well as the bakers rack. The price when you go into the stores are much more than on this website. The product is very sturdy. I have already referred a few people to this website.
2,hardly adequate,"used this to jack up a wall in my garage. the tool says specifically to not jack up structures, but it's a 4 ton jack and it was one wall on my garage and i used two of these so i didn't see an issue. worked well. next day one of the jacks has a pool of hydraulic oil under it. guess i busted a seal or something, now i don't trust it anymore. the other one is fine and they worked well when they worked. 2.5 stars.edit: 5/4/09. well the other one gave up the ghost the other day. i can't recommend these. perhaps all i need to do is put more oil in them, but spilling oil all over the place isn't the sign of quality seals."
2,HARBOR FREIGHT RE-SELLERS ?,"VERY LIGHT WEIGHT, almost flimsey. Save over half, buy from Harbor Freight if you must. Most all products, ""BIG HORN"", are available from Harbor Freight at half price or less!!!"
1,I had owned this product,"I found this jig to be [poor quality], flimsy and inaccurate. It is hard to set up and flexes easily making accurate tapers impossible. Take my advise and spend a little more money for a good one or build one yourself. I threw it away."
4,Just like dancing a jig.,"Well, it works very well. I am relatively new to woodworking, and have found that when building something that requires multiple tapers, you really can't go wrong with this jig.I recently built two chairs and a settee/glider using Redwood, which is very expensive wood in my area, and didn't want to take any chances when cutting out 12 tapered legs...wanted to be sure that they were all indentical.This is certainly the trick for that. Even if you would be off 1/16th inch or so, all of the cuts will be the same. A minor mistake is moot because all legs turn out the same.Very good product, easy to use, light weight and durable. You should have one of these when cutting multiple tapers."
3,It was missing two machine screws,"This works well and was easy to assemble but it was missing two machine screws that hold the curved guide. Luckily I had the parts left over from old project but nothing irritates me more than to get something, take it out of the box, start to put it together and find parts missing."
2,Very Poor Design/Quality,I have owned this jig for a while and wish I had spent the money on making my own jig from the get-go. It is very inaccurate and hard to adjust. Make your own.
4,Well worth it,The only problem with this unit is the lack of flexible mount - it won't convert to a speed-light. Other wise I use these all the time on my School Ball Photography with amazing results. Highly recommend. Nigel - I shoot School Ball Photos - [...]
5,Is There A Paradise?,"A ""novel of the northwest"" by William Byron Mowery, this book is a vivid and thrilling tale of the Canadian Northwest. Set in the time in which it was written, as most of his books are, this is the story of Gary Frazier, who while on vacation finds himself involved with a mail truck robbery and killing of the driver of which he is accused. He manages to escape from the Mounties and flees to British Columbia. There he meets an old prospector and a lovely girl and seems to be on his way to happiness until he runs afoul of Hugh Ludlow who wishes to control the entire Saghelia Valley. Given 24 hours to get out, Gary elects to stay and fight all the while knowing the possiblity of capture by the Mounties loomed as well. This is one of the best of Mowery's works, and that in no way diminishes any of his other novels. All of them are good and well worth reading. Get this one and see if I am right."
4,Right On,"Most days Meditations hits me right where I am. It targets my inherent weaknesses and causes me to self-evaluate and change course (at least for that day--because the next day I seem to need the cousin of the previous article).These reflections are short, which is good, and helpful whether or not you are a Christian (I am). I have bought several others as gifts."
5,Melody does it again!,"I initially bought this book for my own personal use. However, I thought it was so well-done that I purchased more and gave them out as gifts to women attending a psychotherapy group that I facilitate. Melody Beattie continues to inspire, educate, validate, and motivate those dealing with codependency issues who seek to deepen their recovery work and become the woman (or man) that they are meant to be. Kudos to you, Melody!"
2,Astonishingly disorganized,"I purchased this book and Ted Harwood's ""Inside Citrix Metaframe XP"" when I needed to design and roll out a 3-server farm of Metaframe XP FR3. This book rarely ever got used. I found it to be poorly organized, and frustrating to use. Answers and information were much easier to find in the Harwood book and on the Citrix support website."
3,No CD-ROM,"The book description says that it comes with a CD-ROM, but mine sure didn't. No mention of it anywhere.Other than that, the book is not stellar, but OK. It tends to repeat itself at times as is common in books written by multiple authors."
4,Diminished Cut Depth... Not much else...,"I can't complain about this dampener too much, except to say that it will diminish the depth of your cut... you won't be able to raise your blade as high as before (it'll hit your throat plate). That's the only complaint.Now... on the positive side... well, gee... if you're using a Forrest blade and you haven't warped it or something, the blade's cutting wood like hot butter anyway... So why use this? I've noticed no perceptible difference when the dampener is attached, yet still... I leave it on. I guess it gives me a little more security knowing that my blade is more rigid than without it. But does it improve the quality of the cut? Not as far as I can tell, and I cut a lot of hard, white oak.Still, if it protects your blade at all, it's worth having... if nothing else, for the extra peace of mind."
5,Just a stiffener,"standard stiffener, less vibration but with the quality of the new saws and blades I dont know how neccesary a stiffener is anymore. Dont forget you loose some blade height with this on...This is a good idea for a underpowered saw with thin kerf blades."
3,might be useful for some people,"This didn't really do anything for me. Of course, my old makita table saw was totally stable before I put it on. It just didn't add anything. Maybe if you had some kind of problems with your blade wobbling, you might appreciate this."
3,Question how much it helps,"It seems to be well made and ground to a fine finish but I can not see much improvement on my table saw. It seems to help more on my 12"" chop saw and might help more if used with a thin kerf blade. I will continue to use it but cannot say for sure if it helps."
4,Not too difficult for the beginner.,"Perfect for kids and entry level piano players (like me who is a 35yo woman JUST learning)will pass these on to the kids I am teaching on an even lower level of learning. Well written, cute graphics, interesting little dittys to play."
2,Customer Service is basically non-existant,God help you if you have a problem with the unit. I had to call to get an issue resolved and the gentleman with a heavy accent (Australian?) who spoke to me was the rudest person I have ever encountered. I spent over $900 and expected basic professionalism.
4,What's your pose?,"The Ginyu Force is an ""elite"" fighting force, so confident that they cannot be betten that they seem to spend more time worring about making a showy pose than to think that there is a possibility that they can be beaten. Everyone will get a kick out them. If you watch the dubbed version, you'll hear the guy with the red skin and white hair, he has a cool accent. The ginyu force is strong and when they realize their poses and their air of supiriority won't exactly win some fights, they don't mind playing dirty. I'd tell you how it all goes but then you wouldn't be in suspence and be dying to see the next episode, so i'll force you to watch it and find out for yourself."
5,Uhh.. I know it's not the vhs....,"It's the GINYU FORCE! Oh, after I finally saw this the other day, I felt soooo happy! Seeing all the funny members of the Mutant Ginyu force is enough to make anyone laugh! The only regret I have is that Frieza doesn't have the perfect voice until after he's had a voice change. If you just LOVE the ginyu force, get this! It will satisfy you greatly with how moronic they appear, but are actually very strong! It's a great buy! I promise!"
4,One of FUNimation's better dubs,"This is just before they really improved. There aren't a lot of cuts, which makes this DVD a good buy. This is when the DBZ series really starts to become exciting, with the Namakien Dragon Balls, and Frieza getting closer to making his wish for eternal life...sub or dub, this is still good. You should buy it."
3,Good but expensive,I have 3 chopmaster blades two chop saws and one for a table saw.There very good blades but they will go dull like other less expensive blades.I rate it slightly better than my CMT blade but it cost twice as much.I like that Forrest will replace the teeth and straighten the blade but you can get very good blades for much less.
1,Forest saw blades,"Absolutely the finest saw blade I have used in 45 years of wood working. Balance is perfect. It even sounds quieter. And guess what, if it ever does get dull just send it in and Forest will sharpen it for free. I have two of them and they have all but replaced many other blades in my shop.Kelly McCLanahan"
5,Cuts through wood like a laser,WOW !!!! Great Forestt Chopmaster 12x80 blade. As all the other reviewers testify this is one fantastic blade that cuts wood like a laser. Perfect balance and no deflection when bevel cutting on the miter saw even with a 12 inch blade at full slide extension. Seems like the harder you have to push the saw through the 12+ inch wood on a sharp bevel the more some blade deflection can occur. No problem with this blade as it slides with ease though the material with resulting accurate bevel and miter angles.I would have purchased this blade here from Amazon.com as I do 95% of the time but Amazon was out of stock on this item and Rockler was supplying this blade at $14 higher than Amazon when they had them in stock. As I really needed the blade so had to order from Slivers Mill. for $14 less.
5,Forrest Saws,"I have three Forrest saws blades and I'm sure to buy more. This chop saw blade gives a smooth feel as it slices through wood and the finish it leaves is finished, no sanding needed, no tear out. I have used three other brands and am sold on Forrest. Try this test, use another brand and take a slow cut and note the feedback to your hand and the finish. Same wood try the Forrest, not only will you see it you'll feel it cuts smoothly. I missed seeing a nail and as soon as I did you could feel the saw started gnawing. If you were there you would have seen one sad old man. Luckily Forrest could re-tipped it at a reasonable cost."
2,blah,"This book is just lacking. I do not often say that romance novels are lacking depth, because too much depth more often kills them than not, but ""Enchanted by your Kisses"" is a book that is absolutely desolate of anything necessary to make an enjoyable story.The dialouge was not redeeming, neither of the main characters had anything to recommend them, and one of the secondary characters was just an out and out bad person without any cause. I couldn't wait for it to end."
2,Don't Bother,"At first I thought this book would be good, but Nathan had no sense of tenderness. He was so mean, and I just couldn't believe Ariel had fallen in love with that prick. So judgmental, so selfish, brutal, rude, and utterly unromantic. I agree with the reviewer who said that the gruesome, heart-wrenching scene with Wess should have been omitted from the story. Ariel was a bit stupid and a bit annoying. I couldn't love either one of them."
5,Great scholarship,"I just read one of the most complete views of the Venezuelan Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion Nacional(FALN) and its role in the whole Latin American political fight for power. Dr. Tarver brings an enlightened analysis of the crisis that shook Venezuela in the 1960s, at a time when acts of terror were viewed as one way to achieve political power. Insurgency has a particular meaning in ""Venezuelan Insurgency, 1960-1968, A Successful Failure""."
5,red boots,"how gossie has lost, looked for them & found her red boots is a wonderful story for all red boots lovers from 1.5-xxx years!"
2,"Did not care for the ""lesson"" taught in this book","My 2 year old seems to enjoy reading this book, which is the only reason I gave it two stars versus one. However, as I parent, I really don't care for this book. On the first few reads, I could not understand what the story was trying to teach my child. Gossie loved her boots, she lost them and then somehow Gertie had them. Then I realized that Gertie took the boots without asking Gossie. I have enough issues with my child taking toys from others without permission. I definitely don't need a book to reinforce that behavior. If you are looking for books that promote sharing, one of our favorites is Llama Llama - Time to Share by Anna Dewdney"
5,cute book,"this book makes a wonderful present. i used it as a gift for a baby shower ( but of coarse i had to read it first). i made a crochet ugly duckling that somewhat matched the illustrations which are similar to the cover and fit in well with the text, and my present was one of the best parts of the party."
5,Gossie is a Treat,"Gossie is the sweetest little book. My granddaughter just loves it. And to tell the truth, so do I! Love it."
5,My Daughters Favorite Book!!,"This book is my 2 yr old daughter's favorite book and it has been for about a year. She loves to say ""where did they go??"" when the boots are missing and she loves to point out all the little animals along the way in the pictures. She also loves to tell me how Goosie shares the boots at the end. It is a very good story and a great way to teach a little one about sharing their favorite things."
5,loving the red boots....,"A lovely little board book about a little gosling that wears her red boots ""every day."" My two year old dearly loves this book and helps me finish the sentences. A lovely, lovely book that will mesmerize toddlers."
5,My favorite children's book,I love buying books for my friends for their baby showers and this is my all time favorite. The illustrations are simple and cute and the story is wonderful. I'm pregnant now and rushed out to by myself a copy. My husband read it to my belly the other day and even he admitted the ending was cute. I'd highly recommend this book... the last page is the best and can promote some really good discussions about sharing!
3,Practical,"His Holiness, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama has done it again! He has given us a statement of simple spirituality, efficacious for both the practicing Buddhist and the non-Buddhist, alike. Although many of his concepts may seem mysterious, or even ineffable, to the non-Buddhist, his basic advice is sound. His Holiness calls upon all of us to meditate upon our inevitable deaths, and thereby to more fully appreciate this life, and facilitate our passage into the next. That's good counsel no matter what your religion!"
5,Times Square Records,If you were around during the first Doo Wop revival in the early 60's then these are the CD's to have. I bought all the Cd's in th set as I was a regular at Times Square Records back in those days. Down memory lane we go!
5,Black Snake RULES,"I loved the whole album. But Black Snake is my favorite. I just love that song. ""Black Snake living in a black hole hiding from the sun. Like evil hides in the darnkness waiting for the night to come."" I used to have the album and just recently got the CD. I had a best of CD but the version of Black Snake on it was different, was really glad to finally get this CD. It is great to be able to listen to it again. This CD is highly recommended."
5,The black snake rules indeed,"Yes, as one earlier reviewer states it, the black snake rules indeed! This song kept sneaking back into my brain time and again after I lost my tape of ""In Hearing of Atomic Rooster"" many years ago. When I bought the CD, I recalled that this is just o n e of 8 superb tracks. This CD competes with the best work of ELP which one is somewhat reminded of whenever the piano dominates. But e.g. there is great sax as well.There isn't any dull moment on this CD! I keep wondering whether it's really just three people (excluded the singer) which produce such a tight sound. The bonus track ""Devil's answer"" is from another album of Atomic Rooster which apparently was a big success. But it doesn't really measure up with the rest of ""In Hearing of"", so I'm still in doubt as to whether I should buy that one."
5,GOOD BREAD,I HAVE MADE THIS BREAD FOR YEARS BUT THE TWO STORES I GOT IT FROM NO LONGER CARRY IT. I WAS VERY HAPPY TO FIND A SOURCE TO BUY IT. IT ALSO MAKES GOOD ROLLS. THKS JT.
5,Yummy Bread!,My local stores have stopped selling this bread. Buying it from amazon.com is great. Good packaging and fast shipment.The bread made in a bread maker is easy. We add raisins to it. It is gone the next day!
4,"Very good, especially when I only use the dough cycle.","I like this mix. I usually make my own from scratch but during the summer I don't like all the mess and time this involves so I tried this mix and it's definitely worth the costs. I only use it on the dough setting and then bake it in two smaller loaves. The bread crust is much finer and softer, which we like. Also, we are always watching our weight and smaller bread means smaller sandwiches, toast, etc. which means fewer calories. These mixes are convenient and suit our summer schedule."
5,"Simple, Heatlhy and Delicious","I bought my first bread machine, and decided to buy this bread mix to try it out. It couldn't have been easier. I used the wheat bread setting, and just added water, canola oil, the bread mix, and the yeast provided in the box. Oh so easy, and the whole family enjoyed it!"
5,Delicious multi-grain bread,"Although all of the Hodgson bread mixes we have tried are good, this is one of our favorites. It has a wholesome, hearty flavor and the aroma while it is baking . . . mmmmmm!!!"
2,Doesn't rise,"This bread used to rise for me a few years ago. I have tried it over the past few years, about four or five times and it doesn't rise. I tried different yeast, more water, putting the dough in a warmer place and it still didn't rise."
1,product is terrible,This product is terrible.I use different types of bread mix in an automatic machine. This bread did not rise at all. I used 3 different packages out of the 6 and all were bad. Basicallythe bread did not rise. I switched to another brand and the loaf came out fine. Be warned... not a great product. Basically cooked a loaf that looked like asoftball.DO NOT BUY!
1,Received Wrong Mix,"I ordered the 9 Grain Mix but received the European Cheese and Herb Mix. I should have sent it back but instead, I baked a loaf of the Cheese and Herb bread. My mistake. It baked nicely but the crust was tough and chewey and I was not impressed with the flavor."
1,"Nice fluffy, but way to sweet !!!","It`s basicly like toastbread, just sweeter. Don`t buy it, it isn`t the money worth !!!"
5,"Hodgson Mill 9 Grain Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",Great product for bread makers this bread taste great just like a bakery. Easy to follow directions.
5,One of our favorite breads,"The Hodgson Mill 9-Grain Bread Mix is one of our favorites. It has an excellent flavor and is better than any store brought bread including the artisan types. We just love to eat this fresh from the bread maker and consider it to be a dessert. We use the light crust setting on the bread maker, pour the bread mix in followed by the yeast with just the right amount of warm water...a few hours later and we have an excellent loaf of bread."
3,great if you don't mind your bread not rising too much,"The taste of this bread is good, the ease of making the bread is good, and the overall product is o.k. But, I do not know why the bread will not rise very high. I'm new to a bread maker, finally using the one I bought 15 years ago, and though my bread tastes good, the bread does not rise very high - regardless of what I do. Still, for the cost and taste, this product is adequate. I tried one other brand and it didn't rise too much either, so perhaps its me...."
1,"Avoid this book, and any other book authored by Prechter","Prechters view is markets peaked in wave 5 in year 2000.Never called the bottom in 2002, and stated thehigh of year 2000 would not be surpassed.Well 7 years later the DOW has indeed surpassed the year 2000 high!High of 2000 was ~12000, today it is nearly ~14000 !!Listening to his advice would cost one dearly.Not only missing out on the recent market rise, but also constantlypushing one to take a bearish stance against the market during theentire rise over the past 5 years, while the market was rising!"
3,"Interesting performances, poor recording","I have a mixed view of this recording. The performances, like those in their CD of the first two Brahms quartets, tend to be slower than most. They ignore, or significantly reinterpret, directions such as CON BRIO. But they have something to say in their own poetic way and do it well. If the recording were better, I'd give it four stars. My favorite CD of these quintets is the Nonesuch recording by the Boston Symphony Chamber players. Although derived from analog tapes and several decades old, the recording is much clearer than this Naxos digital CD. A much newer CD of the first of these quintets with the Shanghai Quartet shows how much is obscured by the poor recording quality of the Naxos CD. I am puzzled that Naxos can produce excellent CDs with the Eder, Kodaly, and Maggini quartets and then allow this CD to pass quality control."
4,Good workhorse,"I have been using this motor to power a fan in a spray booth for about ten years. The Baldor motor is a dedicated workhorse for daily use. The only problem I have had with it is that the wires in the connection box (which is very small) tend to burn off at the connection to the hard incoming wire. I have been able to cut them back and reconnect them and still use the motor which itself hasn't given me any problems. I run this motor about 9 hours a day, 6 days a week and haven't worn it out. $ for $ a good investment."
3,Mixed Bag,"This CD is on the music club label, and as it was recorded at Ronnie Scotts I assumed it would be an atmospheric Jazz recording. However after purchasing I was mainly disappointed. The recordings date from 1990 to 1993 and whilst Ayers Vibes playing is excellent the backing is (for me) that irratating jazz funk style that is doubtless great at a club but not as music to listen to. So you get Keyboard strings droning on in the background most of the time.Theres no denying the quality of the musicainship though. The band plays some cracking solos. Some of the tracks are very long. Track 1 (Searchin') is over 12 minutes long, but there are very good Vibes, Guitar and Sax solos. For me it gets its three stars because of the quality of the musicianship. The style the music is played in is very much a personal thing so if like Jazz Funk you'll probably love this - not me though!"
3,"Beautiful shelf, but color is off","This is a beautiful shelf, but the color is way off. I should've returned it, but since I didn't, I ended up repainting ( since I needed a shelf for a project, and didn't have time to return it ). Unless you want a shelf with an ""orangey"" color, just buy a plain white one."
4,Good product and good seller.,"This Yagi antenna is laser cut out of 1/8 inch thick aluminum and then anodized to protect it from corrosion. It came with a coax cable pigtail and the "" u-bolt "" for fastening it on to a 1 inch diameter mast ( I used 1 inch EMT conduit ). Using this with a cell signal amplifier on my cabin cruiser boat to get a better signal.Nicely made piece of gear."
5,Great cell antenna!,"I live in a very rural area that gets spotty cell signal at best. Most of the time I cant get a signal, and when I do, it only lasts for maybe 5 min, so I can maybe send and receive stored texts during that time, but would never be able to make/receive calls. I bought this Yagi antenna and coupled with the cell amplifier I bought from Wilson, I now have 3-4 bars of service inside my house. Its great and worth every penny! Since I know that cell companies are only going to build cell towers where they are apt to get a return, this is the next best option. It picks up the slightest signal, and then the amplifer extends it inside the house. If you are looking for a good cell antenna, this works great."
4,Tribute to Men of Incredible Courage in Overcoming the Unknown,"History gives its audience a nice overview of some famous journeys, explorations, and discoveries from the time of the Vikings in the late 8th century to the contemporary exploration of Antarctica. Great explorers such as Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Ferdinand Magellan, Henry Hudson, David Livingston, and Roald Amundsen come back to life through a well-paced narrative, superb photography, expert comments, appropriate computer animation, and, last but not least, well-done reenactments. In summary, this DVD set will fall in the good graces of any history buff eager to know ever more about humanity's past."
1,Poor quality insert.,"I have two problems with this insert and I consider them very important. First, the insert was not flat. I had to run it through my jointer several times to flatten it. So don't buy this insert unless you have access to a jointer.But, the major problem was the adjusting set screws were too short to bring the insert to the top surface of my jet saw. I ended up inserting normal pan headed screws from the bottom. This gave me enough adjustment room to get the insert level.So again, don't buy this insert unless you have access to an assortment of screws."
1,Is this really a Cole Hann shoe?,"I am so disappointed in these shoes. They are cheap, they look cheap, I am begining to wonder if there is any leather in them at all. I have had many a Cole Hann shoes and never in my life have I seen anything like these. Do not buy these if your looking for a good pair of shoes. Will look at some Johnston Murphy's, something. If I can return, I will."
4,Cole HaanTan Leather Loafers,"The order arrived promply and the shoes were basically as advertised. The shoes are ""stiff"" and will need to be worn some to get broken in. As with many products these days they were ""Made in China""."
4,A Lifesaver for a New Vegetarian,"When I became a vegetarian (in 2006), ""The Vegetarian Family Cookbook"" by Nava Atlas was a lifesaver for my family and me. It provides a range of recipes for soups, casseroles, sides, salads, dressings, snacks, wholesome baked goods, lunch ideas for kids/adults, and more. (And I have to mention this: I learned to make vegetable sushi from this book!)Besides the variety, the recipes are creative but uncomplicated with easy-to-find ingredients. They're healthy, delicious and customizable. The author provides vegan/egg-dairy options, nutritional analysis for each recipe as well as menu suggestions.While it does lack photos, I have never missed having them. I still refer to it often and highly recommend it."
4,Great for busy families,I really love this recipe book. It helped me get started being a vegetarian by showing me easy delicious recipes that my whole family likes.
3,not much new here,"I have another veg cook book by Nava Atlas, and this book is very similar. I got this book because it's big selling point is that it has plenty of simple recipes for picky kids. This book didn't really offer much new from any other veg book and nothing really new or inspiring for my picky kids. If you are looking for a basic simple veg book this one is okay. It offers plenty of vegan recipes, maybe more vegan than vegetarian. Not the best book ever."
4,"Great place to start for vegetarian recipes, but...","I like this recipe book for its family-friendly approach. It has great basic recipes, and my family has enjoyed most of the recipes we've tried. The only drawback I've found is that the food, as prepared per the recipe, tends to be bland. I usually research my other recipe books on what spices to add and have been pleased with the results. The book does suggest ""embellishments"", but usually not amounts to add."
5,Great recipes,I have made a few of her recipes and I really love her seitan fajita recipe. Have not got around to making all of her recipes yet.
4,"Outstanding wholesome baking recipes, mundane meals","The best part about this cookbook is the baking section. Both the muffin recipes and the cookie recipes incorporate whole wheat flour, flax seeds, natural sweeteners, with just a tablespoon or two of oil (and are vegan) and they come out superb! This book is worth buying just for this section alone! As for the remaining recipes of the book, they are certainly family fare, so more sophisticated palates will be disappointed. But, if you have a family of picky eaters, or are cramped for time and need to whip up a speedy meal based upon pantry items, this is a perfect book to turn to. The more adventuresome cook can use the recipes as a base for more creative meals."
3,Not Great,This is the first vegetarian cookbook I've tried. I just decided to eat vegetarian a couple of nights per week and thought this might be a good place to start. I found it very uninspiring. I made a few of the recipes and my family was unimpressed. They're not picky so that wasn't the problem. They just didn't love anything I made from the book.
5,Great book!,"Very good, thorough book - especially for newbies like me. We're not vegetarians but are simply looking to reduce our meat consumption and my kids will eat the food created from the recipes in this book - perfect for summer!"
3,I gave as gift,I did not cook anything from this book before giving it to my daughter-in-law a new vegetarian. She said she has prepared some delicious meals from it and she loves it.
4,Mellow and Sweet.,"This is a nice sleepy tea to sip before bed. The mint is very soothing, and the vanilla helps make this a very mellow brew."
4,weak,"Weak foam, I guess you have to pay more for more sturdy foam that does not collapse. Other than that, it's OK."
4,Good product,"It looks great and is a sturdy heavy sign. However, on the back there's a sticker saying that materials in it are known to the state of California to cause cancer so don't rub it on yourself I guess?"
5,great stuff!,"We use this at the first sign of a cold or sore throat! Mix with warm water and gargle, then swallow...."
3,more for children than adults,"When i bought that book i thought about beautiful works done in Morocco or iran, don't expect nothing great, just children drawings (in color though) to put together patterns and make tessalations. Very expensive for what it is : a little booklet (40 pages) on the history and how to make tessalations for children no more"
5,Wonderful Interdisciplinary Resource,Wow! Loved this book. It is absolutely perfect in all ways. Wish I would have bought it sooner!
3,Tessellations: The History and Making of Symmetriccal Designs,"The history of Tessellations were good, but the making of tessellations was not. I thought that this book would give more insight as how to create your own tessellation design. It had patterns and samples of how to create the tessellations featured in the book."
1,This is a children's book; the title misled me,"This book is a children's book, with a small content. Somehow I fooled myself in judging it by its cover, and I expected more from it than I got."
3,Just like a visit,"if you have been there,its a detailed review. If you haven't been there, read and you will know whether its worth the trip. Good job."
4,Does what it should,"Nicely written. Clearly, the writer is fond of the subject. After reading this book, most readers will be too."
3,The Absent Minded Professor,"Paul Erdos was the epitome of the absent minded professor. Paul Hoffman's book reads more like a series of anecdotes related by friends than a ""true"" biography. It is an enjoyable quick read."
4,Great Portrait of Mathematical Prodigy and Anomaly,"The Man Who Loved Only Numbers was an absolutely enjoyable read. The information about Paul Edros's life was very telling and interesting. Besides being able to discover the negative numbers by himself, Erdos disproved the notion that mathematicians only do their best work as young men. Erdos was the prominent counterexample to this belief, almost working 20-hrs. a day on math. Though it seems he did nothing else, Erdos's love for mathematics is, simply put, unbelievable. It seems as though he always lived in a world of numbers and sought to find the truth behind them. The book portrays all of this very well while also providing intriguing anectodes about Erdos's life adventures."
2,Why pick on special people?,"Calling a great mathematician crazy and a speed/ drug addict isn't good. It doesn't advance mathematics.... Erdos was very nearly an Autistic Savant. His mother's love and care saved him. A life that might have been spent in an institution became that of one of mathematic's all time greats. He wasn't ""perfect"", but he was unparalleled in history in his in long term productivity and his teaching on the individual level. For this he should be praised and not run down by the ""facts"" journalistically. Not all mathematics people are ""crazy"". It takes a special kind of mind to appreciate some problems and solve them! Erdos was a very special person whose memory should be protected and not abused as this book does. This level of honesty does no one any good. I can not encourage the running down of the memory of great men: too much of that goes on these days."

1,A big disappointment.,"This book is not really a biography of mathematician Paul Erdos [pronounced: ""Air-dish""] (1913-1996), who specialized in number theory. Instead, it's a disorganized collection of anecdotes about Erdos, most of which portray him as absent-minded, sloppy, and demanding as a house guest. There's almost no discussion of his achievements in mathematics. Erdos lived only for his work, yet this book considers everything except his work. The reader doesn't learn why Erdos was famous -- only that he was an eccentric genius. To expand the book to over 200 pages, the author included largely irrelevant material on the history of mathematics. This book was a waste of time and effort."
1,This book is horrible.,"I bought this book to learn more about the life and work of Paul Erdos. I expected a biography. Instead, I found an appalling amount of filler. Anecdotes not about Erdos, as I expected from the reviews but cliched anecdotes about famous figures in the history of mathematics. Why does the author bore us with this? Who amongst his readers hasn't already heard these well-worn stories before? Though the author claims to have interviewed him extensively, I almost doubt it. This book places uneven weight on certain periods of his life, seemingly for no other reason than that he didn't bother to do thorough research. Definitely the worst scientist-biography I've read (And I've read many.) I still want to know more about Erdos. I am left with a very incomplete image. I am hoping that the competing biography, ""My Brain is Open"" will be a bit better."
4,considering why I read this book,"I read this book to find out more about Paul Erdos' personality. There was a fair amount of math in the book, so I skipped over those parts. I enjoyed reading the anecdotes which gave me some insight into this fascinating character. I don't believe this book was intended to be a piece of great writing, and so it certainly was not that. Merle Miller's 'Plain Speaking' about H.S.Truman was written much better."
4,Story of a weird man with a great mind,"This is not a mathematical book, neither it is a book on the history of mathematics. It is the story of a man, and of a man whose story is worth being taught. Actually I read this book in italian, but I think the main quality of the book is not the style of writing, but the crazy passion for math showed and in some sense explained. I reccomend this book to everyone who enjoys light reading about math, like ""Fermat's Enigma""."
3,A biography of a man who hardly had a life,There were so few events in the life of Erdos that a conventional biography in which the subject's inner life and external exploits are detailed is clearly impossible. This book is best described as a mathematical-life history. It gives the reader the flavor of mathematical research pursued with single-minded intensity.
5,Even if you aren't a math person.....,Even if you are not a math person you will find this book enjoyable. During every sitting there was at least one story of Erdos's witicisms or crazyness that made me laugh out loud.His accomplishments are especially touching given what he came from. One of the other reviewers commented that this book did not go into detail regarding his mathematical achievements. I think that is a strength because who wants to read boring numbers and symbols? Check it out.
3,An interesting read...,"Having had no prior knowledge of Paul Erdos and his work, I purchased this book on a whim. I enjoy biographies of interesting people and he certainly was one. The book is a biography for the most part but also contains much biographical anecdotes of other great mathematicians. I found these anecdotes to be very interesting and a good introduction to this group of interesting people. I find these brief descriptions interesting enough to pursue full biographies of some of these individuals. There is also much discussion of various mathematical principles and theories. While this may seem daunting, they are explained with amazing lucid language that any layperson may grasp even these most difficult mathematical laws. I found the book a great introduction to the world of mathematics and found myself more interested in math than I ever was before. It made me regret not taking calculus in college."
2,"""Lazy River"" Review was Correct","I concur with the previous review that called the book a meandering, lazy river journey.This book is disappointing if you are looking for a true biography of Paul Erdos. I felt like I was reading an extended magazine article that had a lot of padding and tangential information."
4,Erdos is god,"An intimate portrait of the legendary Paul Erdos. Paul Hoffman spent a lot of time around Erdos and as a result he's able to describe Erdos' life in great detail. For better understanding of the greatness of uncle Paul I recommend ""The Mathematics of Paul Erdos"" from Springer Verlag."
2,Poorly written,"I liked the early part of the book, but Hoffman's style of stringing together a bunch of different anecdotes only loosely connected became grating. I stopped at page 150."
3,Not quite a biography,"This is not quite a biography in the sense that has almost no reference to his way of thinking, his intelectual development during his youth and adultness, etc. It's mostly an account of part of his mathematical work, including many additional maths that could be considered unnecessary for the book I expected to get. It's a fine book just because it's about a mathematician and mathematics."
4,Prime Reading,"Give this book a chance, and it will rekindle the joy in numbers that you probably lost, like me, sometime in high school algebra. Though Hoffman's non-linear account of Erdos'life is certainly fascinating, this book is really a celebration and meditation on the elegance of number theory, with cameos by all the great mathematicians from the Greeks to Andrew Wiles, the modern day conquerer of Fermat's Last Theorem. A fun and well written book, and I think you will gain a very strong admiration for Erdos as a human, not just a math genius, as you go along."
5,Math Was Never this Much Fun,"The best book I have read in months because the human being and the mathematical mind make an irresistable brew both touching and stimulating. Filled with fun, peppered with stretches to your thinking, and all tied together by the subject, Paul Erdos who spends a lifetime riding a magic carpet of numbers, puzzles and vexing word problems. No deeper math skills necessary to fully enjoy this enchanting book."
2,"This book is okay, but flawed in many ways.","Hoffman is certainly right that Erdos was fascinating, but so much of this book is filled up with stuff that has nothing to do with Erdos. I think the New Scientist was right to say that this book shows signs of being a magazine article bulked up at great speed into a book. The New Scientist was also right that the Erdos biography by Bruce Schechter, ""My Brain Is Open,"" is far better written and gives a much better sense of Erdos the human being as well as Erdos the mathematician. A big disappointment. Schechter's book shows that Hoffman did a lazy job and relied on the strong personality of his subject --rather than good and careful writing-- to supply any interest this book has."
5,A Book that Helps You See You are not alone,I have bought copies of this book to give to friends who have lost a child because this was so helpful when I lost my daughter. It explains without preaching the process of grief...it allows you to be a part of a community who knows your pain without telling you how you should feel. It gives additional reading as well. It is short and doesn't waste your time when you don't want to read ...but the pain is so great you need to know what to do.
3,It's OK,"I rec'd my order of the book The Golden Voice in a timely manner. I ordered it because my daughter, who is a graduate of Ottawa University in Ottawa, KS, said it was one of her all time favorite books. She also said it is almost impossible to find in the basement of the University library. The book was in okay condition, the cover was worn, and the inside pages are loose from the binding. Nevertheless, when I finish reading it, I will give it to my daughter for her to re-read and keep in her own library."
2,Disappointing,The quality of the video and narrative is so-so. Its a very dated approach. Something you might have viewed in grade school. We were disappointed.
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"Utterly bleeping pointless. This stuff is so pointless to watch, you shouldn't accept a copy even if someone tries to give it to you, because it would just cause you to waste the time it takes to watch it.And do not be deceived by the title. There's very, very little baseball on here. The one segment devoted to just baseball is not bloopers - it's pranks. And not a single one of them were funny. Putting a snake in a bread basket? It's not funny, and it has nothing to do with baseball.[...]"
1,DO NOT BUY,"This DVD is terrible, repeat clips and bloopers that aren't funny or that last too long. I can't believe I didn't read the reviews before I bought it. There is very little baseball on here and a few clips have been seen on AFV, so we've seen them 10 times. Boring, boring, boring."
1,"Don't buy this. If someone gives it to you, give it back.","This is nothing but a huge dissapointment. There's almost nothing on this video about baseball. If there was a rating lower than zero stars, I would give it that rating."
5,Magnificent environmental mystery!,"Skye Kathleen Moody's second novel about Venus Diamond, Fish and Wildlife agent, set in the Pacific Northwest, is a riveting and thrilling mystery. Venus heads to Fern, Washington, home of an exclusive perfume corporation, to investigate the murder of a Canadian lepidopterist. Moody again demonstrates her depth of research into environmental issues surrounding endangered species and fragile ecosystems. Her cast of interesting, quirky, believable, and resourceful characters and her well-woven plot make this novel not only an excellent and exciting mystery, but a novel which promotes a thoughtful consideration of some of the major issues surrounding modern society and its interaction with earth's ecosystem."
4,"Works great, have it dedicated to SawStop pro table saw","This unit has worked very well. It is inexpensive enough to dedicate to one tool. I have it connected to my SawStop Professional, with a Y connector to allow for the blade guard pickup. It has plenty of suction for that use. I have also tried it with my Grizzly G0513 bandsaw, with very good results. I did remove the grates that protect the inlet and outlets, as they clogged almost instantly from the table saw shavings."
5,It's a wrap!,"I own more cookbooks that any one could possibly use, but this is my favorite. I've tried many of the recipes and never had a flop. All are flavorful. I love having pictures for most of the recipes. Great ideas, descriptions of ingredients, and descriptions and recipes for the wrappers! Last week I bought all of her books. This week I'm ordering two copies for my friends. If you want to make healthful tasty meals, this is the cookbook for you. Be sure to try the Grilled Miso Salmon with Sweet-and-Sour Cucumbers!"
4,Good Book,Good books lots of delicious wraps and the pictures are great. I would definitely recommend this sort of book if you like to cook.
5,"quirky, funny story for Adults and children alike","This is a funny, quirky story about a girl who finds a crocodile under the Christmas tree. The illustrations are watercolors of a Victorian mansion, the characters are fun (most of them are sterotypes but funny to read in different voices) and the story is just very original. Children will enjoy the idea of a crocodile and it's antics, while adults will get the jokes that are probably over most kids' heads...including the last illustration without any words that ends the book with a last laugh. I would definetly reccomend this one!"
1,Molinari,"Would love to try Salametti Secchi Cacciatore but I can't get anyone to reply to my e-mails. When ordered they shipped wrong product. Again, is anyone home?????? Hello"
2,Product doesnt match the photo...,"The actual bag is blue in color and made out of canvas, not gray/black as indicated. The material feels cheap and the brackets are plastic - not metal as indicated in the photo."
5,Helpful when traveling,The Sit 'n' Stroll bag is essential when you need to leave your stroller for the airline to put in the cargo hold. It protects it plus it comes with a handy strap to carry it.
1,Counterfeit or Expired,"Be cautious. I bought this cologne - which is sold and shipped by Amazon - and if it is not a counterfeit (I trust Amazon), it is expired. Its scent is weak and fades quickly. I am used to Lagerfeld's Photo and I should say the other ones I had were not only strong but lasted for a whole day at least. I bought four of them, and I wanted to return the three unopened ones. This is what Amazon tells me:""For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.""Put differently, it is permissible to ship hazardous materials to customers but not the other way around. This is odd, to say the least."
4,Still a classic,"I have bought this for my husband in the past. When he ran out of his cologne, he gave me this bottle as a ""reminder"" of what to get when searching. I love the smell and it seems to last all day. Shipping was quick."
2,Great idea but is not practical and badly made.,After much research we decided on this bank to help teach our children about money management. I love the overall look and concept of the bank. Once we received it we broke the lids in a matter of minutes. They were too hard to put on and take off. The only way we could open the lid was to break it. Now the lids are basically useless and just sit on top of their compartments. It is also VERY hard to get the money out. After we broke the lids and took them completely off (they are on some sort of plastic hinge) we still have a hard time getting the money out. the openings are too small for even my small adult hands. You can't tip it over because then all the money will fall out of the other compartments. Overall I am disappointed and am looking for a new bank.
1,Manufacturing Disaster,"I love the overall concept of this bank and will continue to use the idea of Save/Spend/Give for my daughter's allowance. The quality of the bank is terrible though. The flaps that are supposed to allow you to access your money are made of a stiff plastic (not rubber) and they therefore are nearly impossible to open. They are more impossible to close. When I was pushing the bottom flap closed (just with my fingers) on the Save compartment, the clear plastic completely cracked, broke off and fell in. We now have the flap duct taped shut. The top flaps were finally pried open with great difficulty (no child could open it) and now they won't close again at all.Great concept...poor execution."
4,Fun How to Video,I bought this to learn how to hypnotize myself. I have found that self hypnosis is a very useful tool and have great luck with it over the years. I am interested in mind games and to see how a professional uses the techniques. It was interesting as well as entertaining. It gave me some ideas for my in house training sessions to spice thing up a bit.
2,Not what i thought....,...it was. I'd heard Zoe Ellis singing on some later Jazz track's & enjoyed her very much. This though is definatly NOT Jazz & just not something i'd be able to listen to more than the 1 time.
3,Do Not Use as a Sump Pump with a Long Hose!,This pump would be best used without a long hose and without an extension cord and not in a well. We have sent it back because it does not fit our needs. It probably works well in other situations. Without a hose attached nor an extension cord water shot right up like a geyser!
2,not reliable,"Agree with others who had trouble getting the pump to keep running. In most applications, you would need to use an extension cord. How often would the water be right near an outlet?? Our pump runs for just a few minutes & then stops, a while later, on then off again. All this while sitting in 5-6 inches of water."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:If historical inaccuracies and biases are ignored and The Hurricane is viewed simply as a movie, it succeeds quite well: though a tad overlong, it's a solid bit of prison and human drama."
4,A great movie for kids to see,"The subject is tough, but the real hero of this movie is a 13-year-old kid who took the initiative to write to a man in prison he believed didn't belong there and made the commitment to help get him out. Adults will be just as taken with this movie. Denzel Washington gives a fine and deep performance. Even those who already know the story of the Hurricane will be moved. Controversy still swirls around the facts of this case, but there can be no doubt that a man denied his rights was improperly sent to jail, and finally, quite properly, set free."
1,Pompous and contrived,"""Hurricane"" the movie and Denzel Washington have a lot in common: they're both laughably overrated. Don't believe the hype, this movie and its twisted-out-of-context storyline aren't nearly as poignant and thought-provoking as director Norman Jewison would like you to believe. Go ahead and buy it if you want, but don't say I didn't try and warn you."
2,Classic issue of what standard to apply to a film,"Like Oliver Stone's ""JFK,"" this film raises the issue of whether to judge a movie by historical accuracy or simply by the standard of if it is an entertaining and well-crafted effort. Anyone taking time to look at the evidence produced at the trials, will have to reach the conclusion that Carter, if not the gunman, was closely connected to the commission of the crime. But should this matter to a movie-goer, who is looking for an enjoyable movie experience? That being said, this is an okay effort, with plenty of drama for someone not familar with the story. It has generated more interest, however, in the ensuing debate about the accuracy of the story as told in the film."
4,Great character,I am always intrigued about the history of people. How what happened in the past effected our future. Denzel plays his character really well.
5,Awesome movie,I loved this movie i really felt for hurricane denzel did an awesome job portraying him i have had it a week and i watch it sometimes twice a day.
2,"long, boring and going nowhere",this hurricane story should have been made as documentary instead of the highly hyped movies. i fell asleep and awoke so many times during the long darkness. there almost no story at all and i would prefer watching the 'green mile' or 'shoshine redemption(?} three times in a row instead of watching this bore-to-death movies. terrible waste of the great danzel washington. lousy director and screenplay. take a shot of nicotin or caffeine before inserting the video tape and turning on the tv in case you fell sleep.
5,A masterpiece with Denzel at his best!,"This movie is based on reality in which the boxer Ruben Carter was wrongfully accused of murder. It shows how awful racism was and that makes one feel horrible. Just because Carter was black, he was imprisoned. This film is remarquable and Denzel Washington is absolutely fantastic as Ruben Carter. It shows his wrong accusation, the racism, and his descent into madness in prison. It's very sad but the ending ends out being a happy ending. Ruben Carter is helped by a group of Canadians who are inspired by his book that he had written and they try to help him get released from prison. It's a beautiful story and deserves to be watched by everyone. This movie is up there for me with films like the Shawnshank Redemption and the Green Mile! Highly reccomended!"
3,"Great Performance, Iffy Movie","Denzel Washington's performance is the best thing in this misguided drama. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters, including a fictional evil cop played by Dan Hedaya and a trio of do-gooders who help free the imprisoned boxers are laughably silly and downright corny."
3,"A good movie, but it could have been better","Unlike a number of people, I won't comment on the historical accuracy of the movie. That's not really relevant to whether or not I enjoyed the movie, since I didn't know any of the story beforehand.This movie is about 2 hours 30 minutes, and I thought it should be shortened by about 30 or 40 minutes. All of that time should come out of the beginning. The first hour of the movie is spent giving background of the man's life. There is no plot development in this first hour. It's important, but largely uninteresting; I don't think they needed an hour for it.The story, once they start presenting it, is very interesting and the movie is well made. A major flaw, though, is the evil-cop character. He's the most one-dimensional character I've ever seen. On the whole, I think the movie is certainly worth watching."
4,"Denzel can make any movie good, even this one","The Hurricane is by no means a great movie. Denzel Washington is a great actor. His portrayl of the wrongly imprisoned Ruben ""Hurricane"" Carter is simply spellbinding. He deserved the Oscar nomination for this performance because without him this could have been a tv movie of the week."
3,Consistant,"This film always kept its focus and Denzel was supurb. The inaccuracies of the movie are to be expected because afterall, this is Hollywood's take. I don't understand why there are so many condemnations of Ruben by reviewers who are taking information from a questionable website. Of course there are documents out there that suggested he is guilty or he never would have been convicted in the first place. Whether those documents are truthful or not should be considered before wasting space on amazon, not giving any commentary on so much as the acting in the film."
3,Familar story but the characters won my heart,"It's strange how I knew exactly how this film was going to end but I still wanted it to end that way. An uplifting type of film that everybody has already seen countless times, although Jewison employs an intricate chronology in the storytelling that made things more interesting than expected. Denzel Washington, as always, is a treat to watch. As for the controversy surrounding the film, I just want to quickly say that there shouldn't be one."
3,DENZEL WAS ROBBED!,"DEnzel Washington can act Circles around Kevin Spacey&folks know that.He Got RObbed Years ago Vs.Al Pachino in that SOrry Scent of a WOman.now he Gets Robbed by that Garp Reject American Beauty.while The Movie was all over the place it made it's point.What Happen To Rubin Hurricane"" Carter can Happen To Any Black Male in this COuntry at any Time.that's not Make Believe but Fact.what goes as far Left thinking to some is everyday life for the Black Male.Denzel Captures The Essence&Heart of Hurricane.He is as Powerful as Bob Dylan's Song.that Song For Me Took My Feelings For Dylan To a Whole Different Level.Denzel was a 5 in the film.the movie itself was a 1/2 to a 2.I Believe that if SPike Lee had Directed it it would have had more Depth.in the End You Have To Admire Mr.Carter.it takes a Hurricane To Overcome CLoudys Opposed to you.He is a True Warrior.Denzel is The MAN."
1,Avoid this claptrap,"""The Hurricane"" is not a good movie. With it's myriad of inaccuracies, it's biased approach to a real life situation, and it's utterly bland technique at story-telling, there isn't much here that you can't find in a tv movie of the week. Basically, they santize all of the ugly aspects of Reuben Carter's life, portray all the real life people involved as one-dimensional heroes and villains, and throw in some appallingly corny lines in hope to maniuplate the viewer. It infuriates me see that people think Denzel Washington was more deserving of the Oscar than Kevin Spacey, whose performance was a thousand times better. Not to disparage Mr. Washington's acting skills, but it cannot compare to the kind of power and depth Spacey's conveyed so memorably. If you want to watch a movie that doesn't provoke or excite anything in you, watch this one, and consider yourself lucky if it fades from your memory soon after it's over."
1,A Great Fantasy Flick,"There is a simple way to explain why this film is so bad. Ruben did it. Thats right, thats the real story of the Hurricane, the man the authorities correctly blamed !!"
2,"Great performance, Crappy movie","Denzel Washington is flawless in a terrible stinker of a corny, hackneyed, lopsided biopic of the life of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, a great boxer of the 60s who is imprisoned for 30 years on charges he participated in a triple murder and then ultimately released. The material is fantastic: a terrible childhood, a mysterious murder, a successful man. But Denzel is the only person who overcomes the triteness of the script and ham-handedness of the direction. Despite Norman Jewison's efforts to canonize Rubin from the get-go, Denzel keeps it powerfully real. Any scene he isn't in is just crap, however. This is not a movie to own. Ever. But it is worth renting."
5,An inspirational boxing story,"Denzel Washington stars as the prizefighter boxer Ruben ""Hurricane"" Carter in this classic movie. This movie is about a wrongly accused man, Carter, who is sent to jail for a murder he did not commit.It is a very intriguing story, because the chances of Denzel Washington actually being in his tight situation are so slim. But he was caught off guard, and subjected to racial and prejudiced trials and law officials.This movie is motivational and entertaining. It brought tears to my eyes, and some parts were also humorous. There was a lot of drama in it, and a lot of story. Ultimately, I think it's a great movie to watch if you want to watch something realistic (this movie was based on a true story)."
2,Wrong format for my dvd players,This dvd would not play in any of my players. It is an HD DVD which is not compatabile with modern blue ray or dvd players bought at walmart or players on any of my computers. The dvd is not even recognized. I guess I should have read the offering closer. It was so cheap that it's not worth trying to return it.
5,sheet fits perfectly,"I'm not sure why the other reviewer had problems with the sheet fitting. I have a standard size crib mattress (purcased from Babies R' Us 1 month ago) and the sheet fits perfectly and was very easy to put on. I am completely happy with this set, it's just beautiful...totally baby and totally girly!!!"
5,This Is a GREAT motor,I bought A used unisaw at an auction for less money than this motor . However it was 3 phase. So I went shopping I found A leeson Same spec.For a little less but I couldnt send it back if it didnt fit.Also baldor has been around a long time and have made great motors.So I order this motor and installed with new arbor and bearings.This saw blows My Old Junk craftsman out the door. I set a carb planer type blade all the way up to resaw A 2 X and it went through like butter the moter didnt slow .If your going to spend money on a motor go with 3 hp or more when you need the power your going to have it . By the way the guy at the delta part store said he would buy this moter . He couldnt get it this low with his disc. You do have to cut the side of saw not hard to do.
4,Good Bang for the Bucks,"This complete performance of Cosi is one of my favorites and bears repeated listening. The conductor rushes the overture but soon settles down to a well shaped performance. The orchestra, while not totally top drawer plays nicely and gives the listener no regrets. Boroska is fine Fiordigli,elegant and vunerable; the mezzo slightly ungainly but with a nice dramatic sense and a fine sound to her voice. The men are well taken. The real star is Priti Coles, a Despina who ranks with the best. At under 20.00 this is a fine set for the person who is just starting, wants an alternative to the better known sets or indeed wants just one."
2,Not a good recording,"Don't be tempted by the low price- this is not a goodrecording of mozart's charming opera.The conducter and orchestra are second-rate, and the castis uneven.Joanna Borowska (fiordeligi) Priti coles (despina) and PeterMikulas (alfonso) are quite good if not great, AndreasMartin is only mediocre. Rohangiz Yachmi (dorabella) hasa strange mezzo-soprano and John Dickie is probably theworst ferando in the discography.If you're looking for a budget-price recording of ""cosi""there are much better versions- the Karl Bohm (on decca), De-Billy ( arte-nova) or Kuijken (brillant classics)"
1,The U2's decadence,"Just one word: SELLOUTS. Second: Not a U2 hater by any means.U2 didn't even record a new song for B-side !. Just another crappy filler remix. It's clear U2 are run out of ideas, but they still have the name, so they can sell any corporate s**t under that name. Shame on them. If early 80s Bono was here, he would be so ashamed of this sellout faceless iPod singer.To say this Copy-Paste worthless rubbish is good is I'm afraid being kind to U2. Turgid. Bono sounds like a dying cat. Embarassing to say the least. The band sounds rushed and weak. They actually sounds amateurish. The lyrics are hackneyed, empty, rhyming rubbish with nothing substantive to say.Do yourself a favour. Don't buy this sellout U2, buy 80s and 90s U2 instead. They should come back with a record that's about the music and not corporate schlock concerned with consensus committees and the bottom line."
1,I like the sound of his own voice!... yeah sure,"I can't believe this sellout band are making the big $ with the U2 iPod and mediocre songs as this one. It's so easy to sell a brand name as ""U2"", that's clear. For worse, there're some people obsessed with them, and they defend every U2 action. Shameful. I don't know how come they can defend vanillla corporate use of the name ""U2"". They don't remember what were U2 in the 80s. They had a white flag... what does they have now...an Ipod.About this tuneless radio-friendly song, I must say pathetic is too kind of a statement."
1,The Price is Exhorbitant!,Thirteen dollars for a bit of polycarbonate with two songs on it? Get real!
1,This [...] makes me feel like,"[...] it's awful. This whole comeback is their worst ever, and this crap is an example. An empty radio-friendly track, filled with childish lyrics and lame music borrowed from Rattle & Hum. Plus Bono is really annoying here. I can't stand those annoying Heeeeey Yeah Heeeey Yeah at tne middle of this commercial excuse for cash. U2 are truly finished. Just listen to their singles from How To Dismantle... ""Vertigo"", ""All Because Of You"" and ""Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own"". As a fan wrote...Dream Is Over"
1,This song is another mainstream stuff,"Stolen from Rattle & Hum, it seems to be a mix between ""All Along The Watchover"" and ""When Love Comes To Town"". This song is so basic, meaningless and childish that gives me angry. I can't believe this is a U2 single.For worse, the video is just ""Where The Streets Have No Name"" rip-off. Yes, they still pretend they're at their best times, playing Where The Streets at the rooftop. Tragic. If you want to know what does decadence mean, listen to those awful Bono's screams at the middle of this childish song. U2 are finished."
1,"'Thanks U2 for your iPod, for www.u2.com, tickets, etc'","classic U2 !!!... yes, this is a copy-paste job from Rattle & Hum. What a tuneless crap is this 'song'. My 15 years old son can write better songs than this one !. Snappy crap, commercial marketing, Bono's trademarked clothes, that's all. By the way...have you seen the video ? PATHETIC, a silly Where The Streets Have No Name rip-off... 18 years later they still pretend they're 20s years old. Just listen to those Bono's screams at the middle of this crap.So this crap is emotional as well, because Bono is rough as 'Sometimes You Can't Make It' ?.U2 have park their car on the safe world of commercial singles, forgetting to communicate what happen in the present world, living in a cloud of fame and pleasure... all because of some childish fans whom love any U2 corporate product."
1,They can't even record a new B-side,"U2 are just marketing, fashion, glamour, style, without substance. Is this the same band that wrote 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' or 'Bad'?. No, this is just a pathetic attempt at trademarked ""U2"". Shame on them. Rest in Peace, sellouts."
2,Not worth it,"Overall I found the the Summerseat to be disappointing. It doesn't move enough air to stop my back from getting sweaty in the car. If you buy this, don't have high expectations for it."
3,Only game in town,"I've bought many of these. They last about a year. I take them off the seats at car wash so that no one can mess with them or treat them harshly, drop, or bang around the cords with the hanging parts, since the parts do eventually give up the ghost in some manner. The product has improved the on/off switch, and now with longer straps, it finally fits my thick car seats without modification. I'll keep buying them since there's no alternative out there."
2,Lack of information,"Nowhere on Amazon did it state that the A/C Adapter was not included. Also, it was not an option to include on the order. Had to Order the a/c adapter today from the main company (Nocord or WWTG)for 9.99 and free shpping (states free shipping on website). I placed the order then received an email that they wanted me to pay Paypal for shipping. Called today and stated it should have been free shipping per their website and the individual stated they needed to check with their marketing company but I still had to pay for shipping and maybe get reimbursed later, like that is going happen. Now have to wait until that arrives for the intended use of the item (in home) before I can see if it even works. I will update this once I get to plug in and test. Not happy so far."
5,A great EP,"This CD is proof Autechre isnt one of those bands that puts out its throwaway tracks on EPs before releasing the full-length. Probably Autechre's most consistent release ever - all 4 tracks could have been standouts on a full-length - Envane has an even balance between complex beat experiments and beautiful ambient pieces. The cover art is similar to that on ""Chiastic Slide"" but the music is closer to ""Tri Repetae""-era AE."
5,Buy this,"One of their best Eps. if you can find it, buy it. It is worth it just for laughing quarter."
4,Delightful parable on the importance of self esteem,"Nog's Vision is subtitled A Fantasy Journey into Laughter, Dreams & Self-Respect for Pricklies & Would Be Non-Pricklies Young & Old. It is a parable illustrated with line drawings by Donna Griffin that is suitable for all ages.Into a world called Prickle City, where everyone is defined by their function, a laughing visionary dreamer named Nog is born. The people don't know what to do with this misfit until Nog shares his dreams with them. The dream transforms the people of Prickle City.It is the author's hope that it will transform you too, Gentle Reader. So if you are seeking a positive vision of self esteem and inner worth, this may be the book for you. Make Nog's Vision your own."
4,Self Expressive Decay,"The legendary bassist Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman) from the Sex Pistols meets Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb), a heroin addict, who draws Sid into the addiction of heroin and emotional turmoil. Their relationship is a difficult one that seems to be next to parasitical where Nancy feeds off of Sid's acquired addition causing an emotional tug-of-war. Eventually, Sid attempts to go on tour with the Sex Pistols in the US, but the band cannot keep together due to Sid's gradually declining performances on stage due to the drugs. Sid gives a feeble attempt to launch his solo career with Nancy as his manager, but this too is ill fated. This turns out to be a dance that Sid cannot keep up with, and the future gives the impression of being dark. Sid and Nancy is a film that provides an outstanding performance by the actors and at the end awards the audience with a worthwhile experience."
3,ADDICTION...,"I saw this film many times in high school with my best friend. We could never seem to get enough of watching it, and we became devotees of Gary Oldman as a result. His performance as Sid Vicious was stupendous, while Chloe Webb was believable as the strung out Nancy Spungen. I am not a fan of drug abuse movies, but somehow this film and Trainspotting held enough of a deeper draw to keep me watching. It does not answer questions as to why or how these people ended up so hopelessly and fatally addicted to smack. It only creates more questions which will remain unanswered. Watching the descent into this tormented world of addiction is painful, but the performances are worth it."
2,Save the romanticizing for fiction... this movie sucks,"Hey, screw ""artistic license"" when it comes to biographies. OK, creating composite characters and blurring fine details in order to make a greater illustration of someone's life is fine, but this movie turns the life of Sid Vicious and his idiot girlfriend, Nancy, into some arthouse cinematographic pool of afterbirth. Besides the portrayals of Johnny Rotten and Malcolm McLaren (Sex Pistol's singer and manager, respectively), the persons invlolved become mere charactures... the scenes of Sid's ""life"" become mere anecdotes, and the metaphores come close to ""stoner logic"" (meaning, if you're stoned enough, you wont care if the meaning is overly obscure.... kind of like Pink Floyd's ""the Wall""). In the end of the movie, one is left with more questions than answers... the one that might stand out: "" what was I thinking when I bought this DVD?"""
2,A little boring,"Its a little boring and it's hard to understand what their saying half the time with their accents. It's a mindless movie so it gets boring fast, does'nt make much sense!"
3,An hilarious cult film!,"This movie is hilarious and edgy, well filmed, with a brilliant photography and a good script. Ultimately GARY OLDMAN steals the show. Apart from that... it has little or nothing to do with reality. As a pure entertainment it really works. But when you consider that Sid Vicious was a clown and the Sex Pistols was Johnny Rotten in essence (despite what a guy with a bad mohawk may say), then you can't help but laughing hard at it. The actor that plays Rotten is so bad that makes me wanna puke... his portrayal is absolutely wrong and pathetic. But the movie is still worth watching just because of Gary Oldman, he does a brilliant job and actually makes Sid look cooler than he was."
4,Sad but beautiful,"I don't know why Chloe Webb didn't go on to do more movies. Or maybe I missed them(?) Anyhow: Chloe Webb and Gary Oldman ARE Sid and Nancy--screeching, obnoxious, addicted, unhappy and all too human. Favorite scene: Sid and Nancy kissing in a New York alley while garbage tossed from a roof floats around them. Next favorite: Sid and Nancy, in a fantasy sequence, kissing on a neon-white-lit stairway to heaven, Nancy adorned in a wedding gown and a crown of thorns. EDITING MISTAKE: The scene in the tour bus. Some New Age jerk is singing to Johnny Rotten. In the background we can see green farmland. But in the long shots, the bus is traveling through cindery desert! How did that ever get through the editing process? Talk about careless. But besides that: what a documentary of sorrow and waste. Terrific movie: great script, bad editing, superb acting. Two out of three ain't bad."
5,The tragic punk love story of Sex Pistol bassist Sid Vicious,"This love story is one for the books. The tale of punk rock legend Sid Vicious and his gal Nancy will take you for emotional rollercoaster. I recommend it for those who glamourised the punk scene. The Pistol's music was of angry, desperate rebels exploding into no future. It captures the infamous tour of America that saw the beginning of the end. Awesome, sad, funny, Gary Oldham as Sid in truly one of his finest performances. The movie shows some scenes of drug abuse and withdrawal that will burn in your mind. The Sex Pistols changed the music scene, like it or not, and this story shows it. No Future, bullocks to you indeed."
1,Sid & Nancy,The system made me give at least one star but it deserves a big 0!!! Good god who let Alex Cox make this movie???? What a joke!!! If your looking for a movie that in no way represents Sid Vicious then look no further. Any true Pistols/Sid fan will see right through this movie. Burn it!!!
1,Not even close to great,This movie would be a great disappointment to all sid vicious fans. According to all the people that had know him said this movie is full of lies.This Would scar a true die hard sid vicious fan it you would beleive. A very much disapointment
5,Nancy Spungen is a Legendary Goddess,"Sid and Nancy is the best punk rock real life based film ever made, and the most interesting story ever told. It was based on fact, and after reading And I Don't Wanna Live This Life, by Deborah Spungen, and 12 Days on the Road:Sex Pistols, you can easily see the realism that the movie was formatted on. Nancy Spungen was a creative. beautiful punk rock godess, even though she was loud, and *unfortunately* a heroin user. Webb portrays her fairly, the real life Nancy was much sexier and charming. Sid was her life, they were romantic, and as every couple, had their ups and downs. The movie shows this, as well as several classic Sex Pistol songs, as well as Sid's solo efforts, managed by his loving girlfriend Nancy. I highly reacommend this film. Plus, Courtney Love, is also in it briefly, which is a plus as far as I'm concerned. It is a film loaded with talent."
1,Terrible!,"There really isn't much to say about this movie except that it was an awful, inaccurate depiction of the relationship between this British punk rock ""star"" and his troubled American girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. Want the real story? Try reading the touching ""And I Don't Want To Live This Live"" by Deborah Spungen for a true to life account."
5,devastating,"a hard but utterly touching account of insecurity,drug addiction and media blitz. Chloe Webb and Gary Oldman are genuine and heartbreaking in the portrait of two(almost)regular people caught between heroin and semi-celebrity and the downward spiral. Totally compelling!"
5,This movie never gets old...,"This is a great movie. If your into punk or rock or any variation of the sort then it's a must see for you. Although this movie is more along the lines of the legend of Sid and Nancy, meaning it's not all exactly true our how it all went down, it's still great. I highly recommend it. Also I paid practically nothing for it and it was delivered super fast. I love Amazon!!!"
4,FOR THOSE WHO LOVE A HUMAN TRAIN WREAK,"If you love watching a human train wreak, then this is your movie. The scenes are at times intense. Oldman plays an excellent junkie. The movie makes me wonder about us as a society that would produce individuals such as Sid and Nancy. The home scene with Nancy's parents was sad as the unhappy couple couldn't even fake acting civil. I was confused about the production of ""My Way"" in the middle of the movie. Was this a short feature they actually did, or was this supposed to be the workings of Sid' mind?"
2,Not for fans!,"If you're not a Sex Pistols or Sid Vicious fan you could really like this movie, but don't trust anything it shows, it's all lies. The movie was made without the concent of any of the Sex Pistols members, they consolted Joe Strummer from The Clash instead of going to Johnny Rotten. It's all BS! If the movie had been about other people, let's say Sam & Natalie, it would have been a lot more enjoyable, but as Sid & Nancy it's worthless. If you want to see a good Sex Pistols movie watch ""The Filth and the Fury"". Gary Oldman is a great actor and, even if some other people have said his performance was off, I think he did a very nice job, most of all in singing ""My Way"". Still he was nothing like Sid. Chloe Webb was fine as Nancy, almost the same annoying voice, but not really like her.Don't watch it if you're a big Sex Pistols fan! It's enraging and depresing."
3,"bad actors , and historically inaccurate..","This is a good film detailing the drug induced love relationship between Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen. It has real emotion and grim settings , and a dark and bleak look at their torturous violent relationship ..while at the same time making us laugh at their childlike immature behavior. The film is also very flawed. It was very inaccurate in several places ( oh come on like we wouldnt notice there was never a Rockhead )Plus the actors while giving good performances do not fit the part..Gary Oldman had to have been at least in his late twenties ..the real Sid Vicious was barely of legal drinking age..same with Chloe Webb as Spungen. The actor who plays Johnny Rotten is so terrible it makes me want to puke..not only does he look at all nothing like Mr.Rotten , but his ability to mimick Johnny's sneer and attitude is nearly satirical. Sid and Nancy is nontheless a classic film displaying an out-of-control nihilistic lifestyle of drug abuse and excess"
5,A Classic That Will Live Forever,"Probably the benchmark of the punk rock movie genre is this beautifully lyrical love story of destruction. If you're reading this review, you probably don't need the plot spelled out for you, but for those who need it: Sid was the bassist for the original English punk band, the Sex Pistols, and Nancy was the groupie/girlfriend who sent him spiraling to self-destruction. The film is based on their true romance, and is a heartbreaking and aching portrayal of nihilism and narcissism.Gary Oldman, back when he was a lean and hungry actor at the top of his craft, puts in a stunning tour de force performance as doomed druggie Sid Vicious, while Courtney Love has a pre-fame bit part as groupie Gretchen (a precursor to her real later life with Kurt Cobain, as detailed in Nick Broomfield's ""Kurt and Courtney"")."
2,Bad,"I'm a Sex Pistols fan, but I really think you have to be utterly OBSESSED with them, and especially with Sid Vicious, to think this movie any good. I thought it stank. (Johnny Rotten hates this movie.)"
2,You have to wonder,"Like Sid's music there is no story here. The movie is a panorama of waste. Waste of celluloid, time and talent.The performances by Oldman and Webb are over the top in the worst sense but the depiction of Nancy by Webb is extremely painful to watch. She turns Nancy from pathetic into strangely funny; a cartoon character.You have to wonder what was the point?"
3,Sid didn't kill Nancy!!!,"I must admit when I was young and naive, I too liked the movie, Sid and Nancy. But, I have grown into an adult. And now on every story I got to know the truth!! Sure this movie is good. Only because it's what most people have taken for the truth. And it's a punk rock romeo and juliet movie. Alex Cox isn't by far My favorite person. And I really don't feel He did much investigating at all, On the truth. So at best this is a good fictional story. I don't believe Sid killed Nancy. Actually if You were to ask Me, I would have to agree ""Nancy killed Nancy""! There is too many things that point to John's innocence!! All in all it's a good fictional story, As I mentioned. If You are interested in the truth, Try the movie ""Who killed Nancy""!! This review was written in favor towards John Lydon."
5,Sid Vicious,"dope movie, seriously Sid and Nancy use a lot of dope hahaha. This movie was awesome with great actors and crazy scenarios. Buy it"
1,bad,"this movie is far away from the true story of sid & nancy to begin with and the acting is awful the directing is bad and the characters are nothing like the real thing this movie makes sid's life look like a joke or game, he died at age 21 from heroine overdose. how could anyone like this awful movie it makes me angry. plus nancy was nothing like the one in the movie the real nancy was extremely repulsive and a major pain... she was rubbed off onto sid and being the rebel he was he liked her. he treated her like [dirt] as well he would tell her to go hooking to get them money. then she got him mixed up hard drugs which killed his motivation for playing bass and eventually killed him. and kurt cobaine nofx anti flag rancid and green day are not punk bands when i read the reviews of this movie it fills me with disgust."
2,:0P,"ehhh... well... this movie.. [is bad]... i gave it a 2 because gary oldman did a very good job being sid.. thats ALL! everything else was wrong and [bad]... first off... nancy goes and buys a cat, she gets a grayish one and HOWDY DOO!!! THE REAL ONE IS BLACK AND WHITE!!! AND THERE WAS A BLACK AND WHITE ONE IN PLAIN SITE!!! and uh.. the singer totally sounded nothing like johnny rotten! sid HATED tv and never watched it but hey! in this movie hes always watching tv! oh and biggest thing.. ... NOBODY KNOWS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED!!!! SO ALEX COX SHOULD HAVE JUST LEFT IT ALONE!!!! ..."
3,Elvis Presley The Great Performances,this dvd is supposed to contain 2 discs I only received one disc. This is whyI rated it with three stars.Title Elvis Presley : The Great Performances (DVD)
1,Avoid this release if you only have a Full Screen CRT TV,"Welp here is a word of warning. If you dont have a widescreen tv do not buy this release. Buy the previous dvd release of this from the 90s.What they have done is places a 4x3 picture inside a 16x9 widescreen. The result is when you watch it on a full screen tv, the pciture has black bars on the top and bottom as well as the left and right sides..A TOTAL Ripoff. When are companies going to wake up and see that more people still have full screen tvs than widescreen tvs.Why not give us a true 4x3 picture as it was shown back in the day..???"
3,"Cute, but of no nutrional value.","I gave it to my husband to read and he said everything in it is true, but would have enjoyed it better before the baby was born."
2,"catchy,if predictable","this is the kind of Jam that you can Bop your head to&Groove to.not much in the Lyrical department,but the Jam alone holds up alright.it's catchy&a decent hype track."
3,Very funny,"I liked this book more so than Lisa's other books. The humor and the one line remarks were funny throughout the book. When lawyer Bennie's twin sister returns to Phili, she is in trouble as she is out to steal her life (the twin was brutal) and does so. Then one day a stranger shows u p and helps save her life."
3,Disappointed in California,"Well...I'm on page 60 and I can't get myself to read on. I went to the bookstore today to find something else to read. So far, the book comes off like an event driven chick flick. The plot....bad twin, good twin, been there, done that. So far, all that is happening is one crisis after another. The protagonist, Bennie, is running around putting out fires, and its boring. I can't seem to get a handle on Bennie's true character. I spent a page and a half reading about pantyhose and pink hair. Even the writing is not as crisp as other books by the author. I've always enjoyed past books by her. Sorry, Lisa, but I'm really disappointed."
1,Blah,"It has been a long time since I had such a difficult time forcing myself to finish a novel. There was nothing to enjoy. I could not figure out what it was supposed to be. Was it supposed to be funny? It wasn't. Was it supposed to be a serious legal thriller? It wasn't. Was this what people call ""chick-lit?"" Then I hope this is the last time I accidentally pick up a book from that genre. It wasn't terrible, just a big boring nothing. It was like ordering spaghetti and having the waiter deliver a plate of naked boiled noodles without sauce or meatballs--unsalted."
5,AWESOME Author!,I really enjoy reading books written by Lisa Scottoline! If you enjoy a great mystery with a little bit of romance then this book is for you.
4,very good techno cd,"hi, my father traveled the world for a living and i would ask him to pick me up techno cd's mostly cause you can't find them here. he brought this one home, and i found it has up to beat music, that i enjoy, heck my 60's year old neighbors tell me to blast my music, oh well, i have found this to be a good cd, great for reaves, and parties"
5,Beautiful oboe music,"The harpsichord version of some of these concerti does not do these works justice. One cannot appreciate BWV 1055 and BWV 1053, for instance, on the harpsichord as much as one can appreciate them played on the oboe. The melodies are more noticeable here. Nothing gets lost in all that continuo playing. The first low oboe note that presents itself in the first track is enough to engage one's curiosity. Afterward, it's just enjoyment. These are beautiful recordings, and perhaps the only CD to offer the combination of these five CDs. The sound as well is divinely clear."
3,Very good starter book,"This book is a very good book, however it is by no means a complete book for building sheds. It glosses over some of the more difficult parts of building a shed like hanging doors or hanging plywood on the ceiling. It only covers the ideal situation when you receive the perfect piece of wood. I found myself having to cut edges, tack doors in place, and remove braces in order to get things to fit right. I would recommend this book as a starter though. 3 stars."
5,Very Informative,"Haven't been able to read through it completely, but from what I have read it does a great job of laying out what you need to do to actually build a shed. Would definitely recommend."
5,One of the Best!,"Besides being an excellent overview of watercolor techniques helpful to the experienced as well as the novice, this book provides valuable guidance for enhacing the ""seeing"" skills we need for being better artists, no matter what medium is used. Purcell's book is among my favorites and I refer to it frequently."
5,"Thin Book, Tremendous Ideas","This little book is packed with important concepts for artists. The wisdom presented is essential for visual composition, regardless of the specific medium.The author's treatment of value is especially valuable (pun intended). Color is important, but value is even more important. He explains why and shows how."
1,"Great idea, too bad it doesn't work",I will start off by saying I was really excited at the thought of an at-home whitening light system. Too bad it is just too good to be true. While the price is very reasonable I saw no results with this product. Save your money!
3,Works Well,I bought this product in conjunction with another tooth whitening product and actually the two of them work quite well together. The two of them combined were much less expensive than going to new teeth whitening shops or the dentist.
3,Didn't grab me,"This (and its companion ""More Book Lust"") are massive lists. The problem that I had with it was that it doesn't help me make a decision - by itself - on what I might want to read next. If I was looking for something new to read, I might check a likely heading & then look up some of the books on Amazon. This list has tremendous volume, but not the detail/ personality of the book that I need to get excited about hunting down a book. The author has clearly read a lot of books over all genres & the book reflects this."
5,This book is very helpful in making books selections.,I heard Nancy Pearl speak at the American Library Association meeting in June. She is one amazing lady because she spends much of her time reading. As she would say what would you rather do housework or read? For her the answer is a no brainer. I found out that not only do I enjoy reading books but I also enjoy reading about books. In her two books she gives hundreds of ideas of what to read now and what to read next.
4,Caveat lector...,"Nancy Pearl, Booklust (Sasquatch Books, 2003)Let the reader beware: picking this book up and reading through it cover to cover will put you on a path that may take you years, of not decades, to finish traversing.Booklust is, quite simply, a book of book recommendations. Unlike most books of this type, Pearl doesn't focus on one genre; her recommendations span the gamut. A reader with far-flung tastes will pick up hundreds of recommendations here, few of which he's likely to have read (my TBR list grew by over three hundred titles in the course of reading this).Another warning: it will take you about ten times as long to read as the normal two-hundred-fifty page book. You'll be stopping every ten seconds to write down another title. ****"
4,A bibliophile's treasure map!,"An an avid reader who favors no particular genre or author, I'm always on the lookout for good book recommendations. With my eclectic tastes, finding a rare treasure such as ""Book Lust"" is a treat. Even though the author does not describe the books in enough detail to whet my apetite about a specific book, she gives many interesting ""leads"" which I would otherwise not have explored.Ms.Pearl categorization of books interesting in itself. She eschews the dry ""European History"", ""Genetics"" mode of classification for the more emotionally resonant ""Czech Authors"", ""Three Hanky Reads"" etc. etc.I would have liked to see more books about science and scientists. I know that fleshing out the citations would make for a bigger (multi- volume?) book, but considering the targeted readership, I presume that would result in few complaints!"
5,Absolutely marvelous - a TBR list from heaven!,"This is one of the best tools I have ever come across for the serious reader. Particularly for someone like me who is always on the search for new titles to read as if my TBR pile isn't already teetering on the brink of collapse. The most amazing thing about this book is how comprehensive a guide this is. I can't think of a category that Ms. Pearl missed and I enjoyed the ""groups"" that she put her titles in. I read it straight through and now intend to keep it close to dip into time and again. This is one of the best gifts you could give to the book lover who has ""everything""."
1,A Disappointment,"I usually love books full of suggestions of other books to read, but this one was really just a massive list of books arranged into somewhat random categories. It was impossible to tell from what she said which of the books I would actually enjoy reading. (Amazon lists and reader reviews are much more helpful.) Also, from those of the books she recommended that I had read, her taste is too all-inclusive for me. She seems to love everything, a lot of which I don't think is very good."
1,Not worth the money,"general information about mutual fund, something you can easily find on the internet."
5,100 Best Mutual Funds You Can Buy in 2004 by Williamson,"A mutual fund is essentially held by shareholders and managedfor an investment fee.

5,Madame Alexander Huggable Huggums,The doll was purchased as a second doll for my 4yr old. She already has one and plays with it often. In addition I purchased one for my 2yr old. Both girls absolutely love their babies! The doll has a beautiful face with eyes that close when on her back. The body is made of durable cloth that allows for much hugging. I especially like the life like detail on the hands and feet which are solid.
4,Perfect first doll,My granddaughter was born in May and knew I had to get her a Madame Alexander doll. This baby doll is the perfect size for a young child. Quality is great and durable for actually playing with as opposed to sitting on a shelf. I have decided to save it for her first Christmas when she'll be the perfect age! My niece is in her 30's and her baby doll stills sits in her child rocking chair.
1,Swaggart is an idiot!,"Apparently reviewer G. Nyman lives a heretical life just like Mr. Swaggart. Who gave man the right to interpret the word of Jesus Christ? No one. But for the past five hundred years we have had to live with such crazy folks among us. Maybe someday they will read the Word for what it states and not from bible translations which have been changed, even throwing out entire books! Catholic bashers should do a little research before they just start spouting off like Mr. Swaggart has done in this feeble attempt."
5,WOW! A LAUGH RIOT !!!!!,"I can't praise this book, and the author, Jimmy Swaggart, enough!This is the funniest book I've read in the past 20 minutes!Do yourself a favor & get a copy, like I did, for 9 cents.It is well worth the shipping & handling.Side-splitting comedy from beginning to end!--John Paul, Oklahoma City"
2,"Repetative, yet excellent reinterpretation","Banning's book is a repetative, prolonged and far too lengthy an essay. He imaginatively and masterfully reinteprets Madison's ideas and actions as a member of several deliberative bodies that preceeded and followed the writing and ratification of the Constitution, finding him to be consistent throughout in his views on a central government and the powers of the states. The reading can be somewhat tedious for its redundancies, but worth the effort. Bannings scholarship is impecable, yet the book ought to be only an article in a scholarly journal."
4,Duke Of Earl,"He has truly shown on this cd he is the Duke Of Earl. What a voice he has and I enjoy every song on this cd. ""You Can't Hurt Me No More"" is one of my favorites I enjoy listening to alot. Excellent performer and a great cd I am glad I purchased."
1,terrible,European bread? In no case (I am from Europe). I never ate something so disgusting. The taste of the herbs is extremely dominant.
5,Delicious,"We are big fans of fresh bread. While we usually make our own from a number of recipes available over the Internet, this company produces fine products as well. We have been pleased with this flavor as well as the Barley and 9 Grain. This makes the best toast and bread for vinegar and oil, while the other two excel as sandwich bread as well as toast. Good stuff!"
4,very herby!,"This bread is more ""herby"" than cheesy. Sort of heavy but really good toasted. I can't really taste the cheese. Will try adding some chunks of cheese and jalapenos for fun!"
4,Happy with purchase,This bread came out big and fluffy in my bread maker. It has a very nice flavor for dipping in marinara sauce or olive oil. Makes a good sandwich with meat and lettuce.
4,Hodgson Mill European Chesse & Herb Bread Mix,"I have made this bread mix a few times in the past, but I was having a hard time finding it again. The mix is easy to use, but does not make a very large loaf when baked. I baked it on the light setting, and I wished I had used at least medium. This bread is really good hot with a meal, but I do not care for it as much when it is cold."
5,Amazing Bread! Tastes best warm but cold is great too!,Husband and I love this bread. It makes our house smell like pizza when we make it and it has a wonderful taste of cheese. I am using a 1.5 lb old breadmaker (probably at least 5 years old) and it rises perfectly. Will be ordering this for a long time to come. They really got this one right.
1,Didn't get what I ordered,"The title says cheese and herb and all I got was the regular 9 grain. If you order this, you won't get what you think you ordered."
5,FRESH,"This is a very good product for both taste and prep. The flavor is excellent, and how can one beat FRESH-MADE breaf?"
4,Good for Beginners and Experienced Freelancers Alike,"Experienced writers who know exactly what they like doing or have been writing for years may be tempted to skip the first section of the book, which focuses on pinpointing a writing ""mission"" and identifying goals. Do the exercises anyway. Like me, you might find that they help clarify your goals and remind you of why you started writing in the first place. I found Trottier's method of project planning immensely helpful when tackling big projects. His list of possible markets for freelancers included ideas I'd never heard of before, such as editing or co-writing articles for scientific/tech journals, where the articles are written by sci/tech professionals who don't necessarily know how to write well. This is one of the few books on freelancing that I'd actually buy rather than relying on the library."
4,Tejano oldies are the best!!!,"I was disappointed when 2 of the songs listed on the productinfo on the site were not included in the actual cd receivedI have been looking high and lo for ""Please Mr Sandman"" by thisgroup and was thrilled when I saw it listed,unfortunately itwas not in the cd I received,but I loved the Music anyway,"
1,Student Review,"This book is an excellent introduction to the basic principles of insurance. We used this text as a supplement in our Intro to Act. Sci. class. It is very readable, easy to understand. Minimal mathematics required, some basic calculus concepts used, but only briefly. Don't let it's small size fool ya, it has plenty of information in there."
5,pet car seat,I am so happy with the car seat for my little dog. It is very sturdy and fits well in my car and makes her so happy that she can safely see out of the window.
1,May be okay for a teacup poodle or a chiahuahua,"I got this for a 11 pound Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. It said it fit up to 20 lbs, so I thought it would be okay, especially since the medium is for up to 30lbs.Installation was super easy. I was suspicious once it was installed, thinking that it didn't look big enough to fit our girl. I got her in it, and she looked super uncomfortable, but I went ahead and took her on a short drive.Cavaliers are not petite. Our dog is only 11 lbs, but she is solidly built. It was near impossible for her to lay down. She tried, but ended up with her head at an awkward angle and finally stood back up. She couldn't move around at all.The device seems like a good idea, but absolutely it will not work for a dog up to 20lbs. *maybe* you could manage a 11-12 lb dog if they are a petite breed, but definitely not a stocky breed like a Cavalier.I am going to give it to my Mom for her 8 lb Yorkie, as I think he's small enough that it might work well for him."
4,Great product,This is a great safety device for my Westie. He can see out the window now while being secured in his seat. It installs quickly and easily into the car. The only issued I have experienced is the same thing others have mentioned and that is the fact that the inflatable cushion won't stay inflated. I am going to ask for a replacement. Other than that I have no complaints.
5,Doggie Car Seat from Amazon...,"We have owned this seat for our Bichon prior to this, and was pleasantly surprised to find one on Amazon. The ""Outward Bound"" lets our ""Abby"" see what we see, and at the same time makes her a little safer. Arrived in the time frame advertised, and we were well pleased with the service, and the price....Thanks"
5,Good price and merchandise,The merchandise was great and the response time in shipping was very good. Thank you
3,not for hyper dogs,"I think this would be a great little booster seat for dogs that enjoy sitting and watching out the window. It was easy to install, and seems to be well made. If you have a dog that would sit calmly then I would highly recommend it. However, if your little dog is extremely hyper like mine is, I wouldn't try it. It has a safety strap with a clip to keep the dog from jumping out, which is great. But when I took my Yorkie for a ride in this seat, he kept flipping through the air until he was hanging himself from the safety strap. I had to keep pulling over and un-winding him. So while it is a great seat, it won't work for every dog."
5,Great - my little Maltese loves it,"My little Maltese loves her new car booster seat. I really thought that she would feel confined, but not at all, infact just the opposite. She is a quit, content little puppy while riding in the car now."
4,Dog Heaven,"My mini Doxie is crazy about this thing. It's changed her life. Now she runs for the car everytime I get my keys. She would leave food for ride in the car! It's created a monster! It is pretty easy to use & adjust to fit whatever your car seat is like. My only criticism would be that the air cushion looses air and you have to blow it back up fairly often to keep a stable ""seat"" and it's a bit hard to blow? or Maybe I'm just out of shape."
4,Great product!,"My 3 year old Chihuahua and I took a 3 day road trip and it worked great. At first she didn't want to have anything to do with it, but after lots of praise, she finally realized that she could see out the window when she is in it. Now, every time she gets in the car, she jumps right in it and is ready to go! I put one of her blankets in it too, as it's not comfortable without it, but she will curl up and go to sleep in it, no problem!"
2,Too small,Says it's for dogs up to 20 pounds but it was way too small for my 12 lb seven month old puppy. Return was painless. Ordered the medium size and he just fits in it. Good product but only works for very small dogs!
4,its nice but I expected something else,the quality is not very good...the dust sticks very easily and the material is not of very high quality...but coco liked it and rides happily so that's what counts
4,outward hound car booster seat,"This car booster seat was exactly what I wanted, my small 5 lb dog fits perfectly in it. She can lie down comfortably when not sitting, while sitting she can look out the window and also at me driving. I do wish it could be adjusted so it sits more in a horizontal position; lowering the seat helped."
4,Great idea but doesn't hold air,"First off, my dog loves this booster seat! She is a 20 lb Beagle and is typically jumping all over the car trying to find the best view. Other safety harnesses have not worked since she is extremely frustrated by not being able to see and practically strangles herself trying to get a better view. With this, she sits relatively still and happily looks out the window. Unfortunately, I have only had the seat for one week, and found that the air pillow went flat after one use. I purchased the medium, with a max dog weight limit of 30 lbs. My dog should be well within the acceptable size. I plan on keeping it and either trying to patch the leak if there is one (haven't looked yet) or replace the air pillow with a real pillow or a thick foam pad. I also found that it doesn't sit square like it shows in the picture. There are no wires on the side and the front edge collapses inward. My dog doesn't seem to mind though. And it was only $30, not $130, so I am not complaining!"
2,Measure your dog first!,"The small is too short for my pet to lie down in, although he is only 9 pounds. The straps on the front rub his ears when he looks out the window or moves around. It tilts too much and bunches up where it rests on the seat back. The one zipper pocket is nice (three advertised) The exchange policy is ridiculous....the company will call you within 1 to 2 business to set up the exchange, and then will ship the replacement once they have received the unwanted item back! I ordered this item for a 9 hour car trip coming up this weekend. Disappointed! Poor customer service and not great marketing strategy!"
2,The air bag popped after 2 weeks,"This is very sturdy, easy to install. I bought it for my puppy, who was only 5 pounds at the time. After 2 weeks of use, the cushioned air bag in the bottom refused to hold air any longer. I'd blow it up, it would deflate. I'd give it 4 stars if the bag would stay inflated."
3,SECRET LIFE REVIEW,Great book if you love history the way I do. Unknown facts about Henry Ford and the boy who claims to be his son. Wish I could track him after 1978.
3,Wish I had known it depicted nudity.,"I had purchased this coloring book to go along with a study of Ancient Egypt we are doing in our home school. It would have been a nice little supplement because it does have nice art and interesting information on Antony, Cleopatra, Caesar, etc. Unfortunatly it has bare breasts displayed in the artwork and I would like to have seen a warning to this effect. Having 3 young sons, I don't think it is appropriate for us and would not have bought it."
3,Not her best,I love Connie Masons books and have read most of them. This is definitely NOT one of her best. There were entirely to many contrived obstacles in this story. Many if the situations would have made good stories themselves if they had been developed. But instead we just kept jumping from one disaster or misunderstanding to another. Pick another Mason book and you will be more satisfied.
3,"good, but not her best.","i have read so many of connie's books, this one would have been as good as her others, but it dragged on forever. there were too many misunderstandings, it was like an episode of three's company. it was very predictable. I was pleased to see a book about a latin man finally- but her cover did him no justice."
1,Disappointing,"I loved the setting of early California history. Usually, I find Connie Mason's books heart warming and very engaging, but this one gave me the sensation of watching a very long ping pong game. Time after time, Rod and Julie didn't really seem to consider the ramifications of their actions. It was a very frustrating read."
2,Satisfaction... I Think Not...,"* Satisfaction is not a given with this dvd...* A collection of ""obscure"" clips...* a preview would help you to decide to NOT buy...* Enough Said..."
2,"So close, and yet so far away","I am a new CEO of a young nonprofit organization. Thomas Wolf's book was exactly the book I needed to read. The content is well-organized, comprehensive and easy to understand and implement. Having scoured it, I wish I could easily refer back to the parts that require extra attention. Inexplicably, the Kindle edition contains no Table of Contents rendering it nearly useless as a reference work. Such a pity."
3,"uptodate, practical and worth your money","The 1999 edition of managing a nonprofit organization in the twenty-first century; formerly titled managing a nonprofit organization is worth its money with more then 350 pages of practical advice. The books discusses those not-for profit organizations that have a public service mission and have an official status.With many short but clear real life examples and checklist Wolf makes the issues in managing nonprofits clear. The structure of the book enables managers to start today with improving their organization. Subjects include hiring the right staff. personnel policy, marketing, finance and fiscal procedures, fund raising, planning, leadership and the board.The tools and examples give guidance both for managers and staff of these organizations. With the help of Wolfs book running your nonprofit becomes easier and more rewarding."
4,A good introduction,"I also use this book as a text for an undergraduate class in non-profit management. It is an excellent primer on the key issues in the field, particularly those areas that differ from the management of for-profit businesses. I use Drucker's ""Managing the Non-Profit Organization"" with this book to add a somewhat higher level overview of the strategic issues and principles in the nonprofit field."
5,My favorite,"Forget the naysayers--of the many, many translations of the psalms I have had occasion to work with (in my capacity as a budding theologian) and pray from, this is one of my favorites. The JPS translation does a superb job of rediscovering, or revitalizing, the poetry of the original. The reader is forced to re-encounter the psalms as they were meant to be heard and read: as devotional literature at its most profound, its most primal.The font, page layout, and paper used result in a crisp text that is easy and even refreshing to read. As you progress through the psalter, you find the translation and layout working together to help you discover cadences almost as rich as the original.Though I own this version, I read mostly from the pocket-sized edition, and never travel without it. I recommend either edition for their beautiful language and thoughtful presentation."
5,The (sorry) state of (most of) africa,"I have just started reading this book aloud onto tape (actually, into a computer) for blind 'readers', so I am obliged to read every word. Even only 2 chapters in, it is absolutely riveting. This is no dull historical treatise - it is lively, interesting, well-written and filled with fascinating information presented in a superbly easy-to-read manner. The little-known (to me, anyway!) historical snippets that it reveals are startling, and it dispassionately presents, without comment, the well-researched facts that show why the future of Africa is still forever in the future."
5,"Gripping, concise and a great read",I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an introduction to how Africa arrived at its present situation. Highly readable from an excellent author.
5,Single Phase motor,I bought this as a new motor for my Powermatic 90 and Delta HD lathes. It is a tight fit and in retrospect I should have gotten the smaller 3/4hp verion. But Baldor is the best motor out there! Top of the line US quality.
3,Faces Of Death????????,"Before bone thugs -n- harmony where bone thugs -n- harmony they where called ""BONE Enterpri$e"".the cd faces of death was released on a low budget record label (released in 1993 , a year before they released Creepin on ah come under bone thugs)that also released a remasterd in 1995.The songs are allright its a so-so album but hard ...to find. i have both versions & there is no differnce in sound but artwork on cd,cover & booklet.here's songs rate:Track #1(4/5),#2(4/5),#3(3/5),#4 (3/5),#5 (5/5)#6 (5/5),#7 (3/5),#8 (2/5),#9(3/5),#10 (3/5).allright for rap fan but tight ...for true bone fans.Tha Ruthless 1 From DeadlyRecords"
1,NOT WHAT I PAID FOR,"I DOWNLOADED THE MP3 ALBUM THAT DIRCTLY REFERS TO THE SONGS AS EXPLICIT AND THE CRAP I RECEIVED WAS AN EDITED VERSION. DONT BOTHER WITH THIS CRAP, IF UR AWARE OF BONES RAPID FIRE FLOW THEN U C THAT AN EDITED VERSION IS WORTHLESS. GET UR $#!+ STR8 AMAZON I DO A LOT OF SHOPPING HERE N I CANT FIND WHERE 2 TELL U ABOUT THIS SO ILL TAKE IT UPON MYSELF 2 MAKE EVERYONE AWARE OF THE MISTAKE. I FULLY EXPECT THIS TO RESOLVED SOON OR AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED UR JUST AS WORTHLESS AS THIS DOWNLOAD."
4,this,this album i recieved is awsome eccept for the fact that flow motion was non explicit and the rest of the album was
1,This is garbage,I'm glad I didn't bother buying this when it first came out. People are asking about $40 they must be sick. I wouldn't pay more than $5 for this cd. Creepin on the come up was way better than this. E. 1999 Was there best album after that they fell off. One reviewer claimed 3-6 Mafia copied off them. There styles aren't even the same. 3-6 Mafia is noted for there dark beats and sick rhymes when they first came out. They oringinated that crunk music down south. Bone raps quick and 3-6 Mafia don't. And if Bone is better than why is 3-6 Mafia still in the mainstream. Cuz ain't no one feeling Bone no more.
5,Tracklisting and Info,"B.O.N.E. Enterprise A.K.A. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony first hit the underground with this realease called ""Faces of Death"". It was the album that Eazy-E noticed and signed a record deal with the thugs.It was realeased in '93, but is very hard to find in original form. You might find a re-realease bootlegged version or something.. probarly depends on where you live.Anyways since none of the other reviews have written the tracklist, then here it is.1.Faces of Death (Intro)2.Everyday Thang4.Def D***5.Son's of Assassins6.Hell Sent7.#1 Assassin8.We Be Fiendin'9.Bless Da 40 Oz.10.Ganksta AttitudeHope you found my review helpful. If you're new to Bone, I recommend you E. 1999 Eternal or The Collection Vol. 1.Peace to all the real Bone fans out there."
3,More a statement on the mistake of U.S. involment than bio.,"This book was less about Ho Chi Minh, and more about why the United States should not fight him. This reader was hoping for a more detailed discussion of Ho's life, his philosophy, etc. This book does over some insights into Ho Chi Minh's character and life, but I was left with the feeling that the book was written for other purposes. The book was originally published in 1970, a year after Ho's death so the book also smacks of the eulogy, glorification of the dead variety."
4,Understanding Ho Key to Understanding Vietnam Conflict,"Ho wanted one united Vietnam. At any cost. He traveled the world looking for answers and support of an undivided Vietnam, free of the influence of other countries - especially the French. The French in France were nothing like the French colonizing Vietnam. The French taught Vietnamese about corruption and lost over 200,000 soldiers over its colonial years fighting in Vietnam. Ho tried to get help from numerous world leaders to include the United States. In the end he got the support that ruined Vietnam from China, Russia, and the United States. Be careful what you ask for. Another great book from Halberstam; required reading like Karnow's History of Vietnam that serves as a primer to understanding the Vietnam Conflict.Vietnam: A HistoryThe Best and the Brightest"
5,Jill,"As a person who went to college in the 60's and lived through the time of the Vietnam War, this book was a real eye opener. I read it before a recent trip to Vietnam, but I would recommend it to anyone who lived through those times."
3,GOOD,"The book ""HO"" talks about the rise of the communist party in Vietnam. How Ho Chi Mihn, who was a native born North Vietnamese, decided to liberate his country from the French who were there for over 40 years. The book, HO also talks about how Ho became to be the leader he was. And his travels to France as a young boy in 1912, to Russia, and even to the Bronx in NY. The story discusses how Ho also was a great follower of both Carl Marx and Lenn, which is where he got most of his idea about Communism. Ho also discribes his hatred towards the colonalization by the French of his country, and later discribes how he formed a Communist Party to overthrow the French. How Ho eventally succeded in the battle of Biendienfu, which was the final straw in kicking the French out of N. Vietnam, and eventally out of S. Vietnam"
5,"Great Suppliers, problems with Amazon Web Page shipping","I wouldn't order the item if I did not want it or think it of merit. I wanted a copy of the book formyself, and one for my nephew in Oregon. Seemingly your Web page would not allow me to enter two different shipping addresses. Is there a trick, when I entered my home address, my nephews would default to that address. When I entered my nephew's address, then my address would be overwritten by his. Is there a remedy for future orders?"
5,Great product.,"A little sad, small dog showed up on our doorstep. She was malnourished, nothing but bones and skin and a very large belly from pending puppies. It was obvious that she would have problems if not delivering, but nursing the pups as she had absolutley no fat and very little muscle on frame. We began her on Source Plus and a paste nutrient. She gained several pounds before they were born.Though she lost most of the puppies at delivery, the remainder did great. We are convinced that this product was able to not only put weight back on this sad little wretch of dog, but saved most of the litter."
2,"Good content, bad recording","If you, dear reader, are considering to buy this pack of four tapes, then you may want to think twice! On the one hand, I was tempted to give the tapes 5 stars for their contents which include a live session, where Jon Kabat-Zinn instructs newcomers to the art of yoga and mindfullness. On the other hand, one should take into consideration, that these audio cassettes apparently are made under some very poor circumstances. The result is a continuing disturbing noise along with Kabat-Zinns instruction. But if that was all! You have to hear the instructions several times in order to understand what is said - simply because of the poor quality of the recording!Kabat-Zinns books and audio cassettes are reviewed on other places on this homepage, and I will not repeat these reviews words like ""remarkably, inspiring and gentle"". Words like these also fits the content of these tapes. But if I could get a second chance, I would instead have bought some other tapes fr! om Kabat-Zinn."
4,Easy-to-Enjoy Format for Word Fun,"Have fun with words day by day--or pick it up on any day. This book offers intriguing puzzles for every day of the year in an essay-like format. If you enjoy words and the unexplainable inticacies of the English Language, this playful tome is for you!"
5,Know anyone who enjoys the Times crossword?,"If so, you've found the perfect gift. By chance, I read WORDS AT PLAY right after having seen the crossword puzzle documentaryWordplay. For anyone who enjoys the process of shifting, goofing, and jumbling with words, only to appreciate them again in a new light, this is a terrific volume by Oysterville native Willard Espy. (You know where Oysterville is, right?)"
3,Some old silly soul that may bring you in a good mood!!,"That's what I needed after my father passed away. I found he had this box with 10 cd's having 20 songs each. 200 golden hits! Many of them were boring ""oldies"" stuff but some were interesting. And among them ""The Esquires"" -Get on up- of which I have never heard of before. I think their music is typical R&B for that time (-67-68) but a bit ""up-moving"". Buying this music is no waste of money I think. The singers have different tonal characters which also makes the sound ""moving""!"
1,Avoid At Any Price,Difficult to use. Was a total waste of money. Rarely able to get it to print properly. Even tried using premium paper. It's now sitting in the houses junk closet.
1,THE FALL OF LEXMARK,I HAVE FOUND MOST OF THE LEXMARK PRODUCTS ARE JUNK---PRICE FOR THERE INK TANKS TO START PRINTERS GULP IT DOWN----PROGRAMING ---ANOTHER PROBLEM---OVER RATED---- MANY OF THE INK TANKS ARENT MADE ANY MORE FOR PRINTERS MADE BY LEXMARK---NONE BRAND INK TANKS ANOTHER $$ DOWN THE DRAIN -----LEXMARK PRODUCTS SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO BE FOR JUNKEDEDDY KLEINBOSTON MASS.
1,It's a Lexmark...,"This is the second Lexmark printer I've owned and it turned out just like the first one... crappy. Being on sale for a small sum of money, I readily purchased an all-in-one device. It saves space and as my current scanner was a Mustek, the Lexmark would obviously be a step up. WRONG!! The only thing the Lexmark X1270 does decently is save space. Only one USB cable, one outlet plug, and one unit (as a whole) to contend with. That makes tossing it in the garbage a snap, too! Don't buy it."
1,Worst Printer I've Ever Owned,"This thing is garbage. I've owned it for a few months and the ink is gone already. Cartridges are VERY VERY small. Also, Lexmark intentionally makes the cartridges IMPOSSIBLE to re-fill yourself. If you're looking to throw money down the drain, this printer is for you. Terrible. Just terrible. Stay far, far away from this piece of garbage."
2,Difficult to get working,"I have the x1240, an earlier version of this product.The printer works ok... but i am having alot of trouble getting the scanner to work on a Windows 2000 PC. No scanning software on the cd that I can find. The help file references a program that wasnt installed and i can't find it by exploring the CD either.Maybe its defective but Lexmark support is notoriously tough to deal with."
1,This printer worked fine to start but when I didn't use it for a few weeks it stopped printing completely,"This printer worked fine to start but when I didn't use it for a few weeks it stopped printing completely.I don't know if the ink dryed up or what, but now it is useless. I also, should have went for the wireless model which as I recall was only $10 more. I wonder if the seller would make me a deal to trade this in on a WORKING WIRELESS PRINTER.VERY DISAPPOINTED AT THIS TIME. A TOTAL LOSS, AND i ONLY PRINTED ABOUT 2 SHEETS TO TEST IT WHEN I FIRST RECEIVED IT."
3,Good printer but the ink is too expensive.,"This printer works well,it comes with a black ink and color ink cartridge.The only downsides to this printer are that its rather slow and the ink is very expensive.Ive had mine for about 4 years now and am about to replace it with an hp printer because the ink is about 10 dollars cheaper."
1,Try the microsoft book instead,"I got this and the MS book, C# for Java Devs. The MSbook is much better. This one is not very well writtenand doesnt cover as much."
5,excellent geography & prayer guide,"My son loves this book. Guiding the reader through the 10/40 corridor with facts, maps, and specific prayers, he frequently reads many pages in one sitting."
1,I'd entitle this review OMG! but that's kinda the problem...,"I'm happy to report that thanks to this book, I now know where to find ""Satan's stronghold"". Yep, and also thanks to this book I'm now familiar with the concept of the ""10/40 Window"", which is a really great way to avoid sounding intolerant or even racist.But the most horrific thing to consider is that this book, through no fault of it's own, was included in my 5th grader's ""Social Studies"" curriculum. This book has one purpose - to introduce the reader to the biggest cities in the region and how best to approach the people in each of those cities to explain how screwed up they are because they aren't like you. Not the message I'd like for anyone to read and certainly not what I'd want to put in front of a child."
5,Defines RAWNESS in terms of the blues,"Wow! I am the first person to review this CD? I do know that the same batch of songs is available elsewhere, but still....anyway, if you like your blues ultra-raw (and what self-respecting blues fan does not?), then this is the CD for you. The sound is pretty good considering that these are late-30s recordings and the music is nasty....let those nine strings chime, Big Joe! You were very special. A must..."
3,"Good Padding, but be careful about size.","These have a good padding in them, however I'm a pretty big guy and the medium just slides off my arm. I'd suggest the small unless you're big enough to play professional football."
5,Excellent Chamber Music Find,"Recently heard on the radio the playing of the Oboe Quartet of this recording and was blown away with the lively and spirit of the peace.Pleasantly surprised to find it on this truly budget price with additional chamber offeriings of this late 19th-early 20th century composer.The additional offerings are well done by musicians at the 1194 Australian Chamber Festival. My favorite in addition to the Oboe Quartet is the Viola Sonata which is luscious and flowing with shades of his previous Rhapsody Concerto.The Piano and String Quartets are fine, echoing Martinu's master: Roussel."
5,As Advertised,The product arrived early and was exactly as advertised. We are using for a spray paint collection booth and it works quite well. Plan on purchasing others for duct collection on wood working equipment also.
3,OK item,"BIG GULP DUST HOODIt works ok but is hard to mount and if you use it on a lathe, you cannot get it close enough to do much good. You need to build something special to hold it up."
3,"3 stars means it's okay, it's okay",The biggest gripe it have with this is that it's too hard to secure. It has almost no extra plastic around the edges so that you can drill holes and screw it to something stable. Some kind of mounting flange would be good. Needs a little more design thought.
5,breakheart pass,This movie was a break from Bronsons rally of vigilanty movies and refreshing too. I didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised as the film progressed.
3,breakheart pass,"Good, but not as good as other A.McLeans stories. Bronson has had much better parts."
2,Atroious music spoils this entertaining film,"Breakheart Pass is better watched with the sound off. The dated, brash and irrelevant music spoiled this film for me. A little silence would have gone along way toward heightening (rather than interfering with) the tense moments and the rhythmic clatter of a train in motion is sufficient music as we watch it traveling through handsome, rugged landscape."
3,No Guns of Navarone,"This movie was OK, but totally formulaic...a cast full of familiar faces and I always enjoy watching Ben Johnson. Suitable to pass the time but not particularly memorable...you've seen it before in different settings and will see it again."
2,Wrong description,"The description says:Breakheart Pass [VHS] (1968)Starring: Gian Maria Volontè, Klaus Kinski Director: Damiano DamianiI was expecting a movie by Gian Maria Volontè.But the picture shows Charles Bronson. And starring is Charles Bronson.Gian Maria Volontè is italian and Charles Bronson is american.You can't mistaken one for another.Very poor job of amazon.com"
4,One of the Best!,"I thought this movie is one of the best westerns of all time. It has a great cast full of lots of familiar faces. It is more of a 'who done it' murder mystery ala Murder on the Orient Express but set in a western theme. Bronson plays a mysterious passanger who is not what he seems. Good to see Ben Johnson, Richard Crenna and also the ol' Mongoose Archie Moore along with Vikings football great Joe Kapp.This is just a fun, very intelligent action movie that delivers in many ways."
4,Breakheart Pass DVD Review,"This is an interesting and different Western with a fine cast. The 1.85:1 widescreen DVD is enhanced for 16:9 TVs; however, the picture quality is just of average quality."
5,Great Movie,"Great quality DVD. As a Charles Bronson fan, this was one of those hard to find favorites of mine. Delivery was fast. Excellent movie"
4,Breakheart Pass,"Charles Bronson at his best. Intrigue and mystery, featuring John Wayne's side kick Ben Johnson. Also Charles' long time wife Jill Ireland. Greed and politics - fits right in with today's political scene."
4,almost as good as the book!,"Alister McLean's novel is a great read, as are most of his books. The movie follows quite closely the book, and is enjoyable....but put it on your ""kindle"" for a good read."
5,Great Movie,Here is another Great Movie.This too will now be added to my collection.Shopping from Home Never got any better than this.Great Saving's Great Service
4,MacLean takes a shot at a western,"Novelist Alistair MacLean, whose normal area of expertise is World War II thrillers such as ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""The Guns of Navarone"", took a break from his wartime suspense novels to write an American western.Here Charles Bronson plays a mysterious man held captive on board a train rolling through the bleak winter wilderness towards Breakheart Pass. Accused of a crime, all is not as it seems for Bronson's character Deacon, is he really a criminal or an undercover agent? With gun runners, government agents, deceitful officials and Indians, this action thriller really thrills and one could do worse than watch this on a rainy afternoon.Highly recommended."
5,Total body workout,This amazing DVD set is a lifesaver! I actually look forward to working out everyday thanks to this easy to follow dance/cardio program. I started out with level 1 and now I am at level 3 and counting. I have lost both inches and pounds and feel fantastic! This is truly a total body workout. The music is great and Louis Van Amstel is a lively and creative teacher. No clock watching here! Best thing I ever did!
3,i got only one dvd,i was disappointed in this it says five dvds but I got only one so I did not like this purchase at all
3,Worth reading,"It's worth a read, but probably won't revolutionize your world if you've spent much thought on the topic."
3,Would have been nice but stones not matched in color,These would have been nice except the stones were not matched in color. Both were like a Swiss blue topaz color but there was a difference in color between them. It may have just been the pair I received. I could tell the difference so I sent them back.
4,You can paint flowers with Louise,"When using this book I found it easy to understand the preliminary sketches and follow them quite easily. The explanations about colors, how to mix them in order to get shades and contrast are superbly explained. The materials used an how to handle them are clear, and ""secrets"" about which amount of water to use, the techniques of wet over wet and wet on dry are perfectly understandable and easy to follow. once you tested you learned al the ""how tos"" you can try your own design. Yet, I'd have liked to see more step to step indications if this publication was directed to beginners. This publication is a must for amateur and self-trained watercolorists but not for fresh beginners."

5,I'm not a rich man,"Excellent record. I bought it two days ago (the lp) in a really decadent store in Madrid, Spain, for 9 Euros (aprox 9 Dollars) and I want the cd since then. As always the David Foster name on the credits was the only thing I needed to buy it, but I knew ""for you, for love"" since 1980 and it is a song that I never forgot though I didn't know it's name. If you're a rich man or a rich girl buy it. Why does it have this price, my God?"
4,"A fun, charismic book!","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and had a hard time putting it down! I will be looking for more from this author ;-)"
5,Best Stick Bag,"This is the best stick bag I have owned. Plenty of pockets and plenty of room for a ton of sticks, mallets, and any other accessories you feel the need to carry with you. The bungee clips are awesome and make attaching the bag to the side of a drum amazingly convenient. I purchased mine years ago and it is still going strong."
4,An extatic first,"Before listening to this album, my main exposure to Alexander Scriabin's first symphony had been Muti's version on EMI. There is little question that from a technical standpoint that last one is the superior of the two. However, this version offers a more rugged, openly emotional and unrestrained, 'more extatic' if you will, view on Scriabin's first 'poem'. The soloists give their best, as does the orchestra. Golovshin's lead, however, could have been a tad more held back in giving in to the score's idiosyncracies, giving a more 'vulgar' impression than Muti - who, perhaps, is somewhat over-civilized in his approach. But let that not detract from the fact that this is a fine recording. It is also finely recorded, and for the price, you can't really go wrong."
5,delizioso cubifrutta,"I bought this in a grocery store in Italy and brought it back to the US. Everyone loves it, but it is very difficult to find. Perhaps I shouldn't recommend it after all!"
2,too much talking,So detailed description of basic moves that you get lost and loose the feel of the dance. I would prefer the couple dancing constantly showing basic steps to more complicated elements of the dance.
5,very satisfied,The video begins with the footwork (basic) and progresses thru more advanced moves and turns. Very easy to follow even with no prior experience. Instruction provided clearly for both leads and followers. I consider this a comprehensive learning dvd for this Lindy dance form. It contains enough repetition without being overdone.
1,Good Songs-Terrible Sound,"I'm a long time Freddie King fan. I saw him in Houston in the 70's. This album looks professional, but does not tell you or prepare you for what's inside. It's another homemade bootleg 3rd row tape job or a terrible sound board recording. I can't listen to it. These are all live recordings of many of Freddie's classics. Pass on this rip off."
1,VERY disappointing!,"So, apparently it IS an album with Lionel Hampton, Coleman Hawkins, and J. J. Johnson-- and that CAN'T be bad, can it? Well, if that is your expectation, then yes, you will be disappointed. Technically it is just what it says, but I've listened to everything except the last track, and Coleman Hawkins solos on ONE piece (Midnight Blue), same for J. J. (Stardust). The sound quality is HORRIBLE, so I THINK Hawkins and Johnson do some ensemble work on another track, but honestly I can't really tell. Lionel plays throughout, and he's terrific, of course, but unless you want to spend a lot of time cleaning up the sound, forget it. Frankly, I want my money back!"
4,Music for Mannequins,"The Minny Pops, a Dutch group on the legendary Factory label, play brittle, minimalistic, electronic, dance music that reminds me of Suicide, Fad Gadget, and some of Kraftwerk's darker moments. The deep, monotone vocals are spoken, not sung, and give the songs a distant, postmodern feel. I imagine this kind of thing gets played at post-expressionistic art galleries in Berlin. Even though it smacks of pretense, I like this album and the generous amount of bonus material that accompanies it."
5,GREAT KID FUN,MY SON AND HIS FRIEND NEXT DOOR HAVE HAD THE MOST FUN HUNTING EACH OTHER DOWN. THE WALKIE-TALKIES ARE TOUGH AND FULL OF FUN.
1,These do not work,These walkie talkies were a big dissappointment over the holidays. They do not work at all. All my daughter heard was static. Amazon should not be selling these. I expect more!
1,Do not buy.,Purchased these for my kids to play with in the house however there is so much static and the reception is so bad you have to be within 15' max of each other to hear anything the other person is saying and when you are that close what's the point of walkie talkies. Do not waste your money.
2,Walkie Talkie,I ended up not being able to use it like I wanted to because it didn't have the range I wanted. I sort of accidentally bought this one.
2,Too much static.,Nearly unusable. Can barely understand transmissions over the incredible about of static. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Wish I could give zero stars!,Did not work! Even with fresh batteries they were solid static and could hear nothing! I would recommend anything other then these!
1,Doesn't receive,I bought these to play around the house with. I couldn't get reception except when my daughter was within about 20 feet or less in the same room. Once she left the room (even around the corner in the bathroom) the reception was so full of static that we couldn't understand each other. Not functional with no reception. I am returning mine.
1,Terrible,"Save your time and money. No appreciable range, lots of static, garbled voices, and low volume. Spend $30 and get a real walkie talkie."
1,We returned this item because it did not work. There was too much static to hear when anyone was talking.,"Not a great toy, didn't work, wouldn't recommend it. We could barely hear the person on the other end and there was a ton of static."
4,'Making it ' Sort of,"The poor self- educated Big City boy gets to Cambridge where he studies English under F.S. Leavis. Podhoretz describes the climb afterwards to 'make it' in American intellectual life. When he gets to 'Commentary' and gets to run the show he is instead of one looking out trying to get in, one on the inside who in pushing the magazine up pushes himself up with it.Raw ambition confessed is at the heart of the book. He does 'make it' but then not quite in the same way that friends he will later quarrel with, Mailer,Ginsberg, Arendt do."
1,Awful,"If you can find a more obnoxious book, read it instead ... simply to avoid this one. Never has an autobiography been more self-serving and uninteresting."
5,The only version of this fascinating Japanese fairy tale available in America,"This children's book is the only version of this 12th century Japanese fairy tale I could find in English in the US. The bold, courageous heroine of the story is charming and delightful, and the illustrations are beautiful. The original story was supposed to have informed Miyazaki's lovely animated film ""Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind,"" which I also highly recommend."
4,Not misogynistic; a story of diminished philogyny,Oxford don Jake Richardson's diminished libido and torturous marriage form the backdrop for Amis's acid satire on the helping professions circa 1980. Many reviewers have noted Jake's scathing observations concerning his female characters'unjustified views of themselves and labeled Amis a misogynist. But the real thing of Jake's Thing is the question raised by waning libido: why do we care about each other? What are we giving and getting in our close relationships? This is a cautionary tale on the false consciousness that is sexual hunger. Jake doesn't hate women; he no longer finds them enchanting. This book is about what little is left after the enchantment departs.
1,Garbage,"I am a fan of Kingsley Amis but this book is so dated and idiotically misogynist it's revolting. Plus it partakes of an oppressive scoffing at self help (particularly American and also Jewish so it's got a jingoistic and anti-semitic subtext as well). Under the guise of humor it's actually an oppressive paean to cultural rigidities - a tittering celebration of stupid attitudes. It's anti self-growth - a lengthy elaboration of the self-congratulatory stance of the brain-gone-rigid majority white male. I did finish it but only through a sort of horrified fascination. My advice is ""Don't bother. There's lots of better things to read than this."""
4,"Good product, fast service, not so great reading.",The book arrived promptly in the condition in which it was advertized. The story itself stays in line with most of Amis' other novels so I wouldn't reccommend it for younger audiences or those who don't like to talk about sexual issues.
3,Put cash on first and last,Hit and miss concoction of pulsating pile-ons and aimlessly droning apathetic exercises.
2,Left where it fell,"I can't tell you in words how much I've been disappointed by this album. After listening to ""Tri repetae"", I spent sleepless nights, and I still use ""Tri repetae"" as a reference point when I do reviews of techno records. ""Chiastic slide"", in many ways, just tries to duplicate the ideas and sounds of this masterpiece, and it even brings an ugly, dissonant and uninspired edge into the music. Many tracks are just built around a simple noise riff and crashy sounds, without much substance. The first two tracks are pretty good, though, and ""Cichli"" comes up with these psychedelic melodies so typical for Ae's earlier output. The rest is just plain boring for me. It also lacks the concept character of Ae's previous albums. And subsequent efforts like ""EP7"" with even more noise and less inspiration have really put me off. Not only Autechre, but also the Warp label started to fade. However, ""Chiastic slide"" is an o.k. purchase for new fans, but for me it was the beginning of the end."
4,Why is this only an import?,"Are record companies in the U.S. to afraid to release this? The album sounds like something you would hear inside a factoy. Some tracks are good like Cipater, and Calbruc while some like Rettic Ac sound like pure feedback. Only buy it if you really like Autechre, otherwise the import price isn't worth it."
3,777111.,"i like Autechre, newer Autechre most especially, but i feel Chiastic Slide is a bit overrated. when i first bought the disc i was thrilled by the jagged, dirty sounds and the fragmented composition of the rhythms, but after i'd heard the tracks a couple times, they began to bore me. the new direction of their sound is nice, and there are a couple of nice pieces, but overall the tracks are structurally very dull and repetitive, even for Autechre. several of the tracks begin promisingly only to pitter and wank aimlessly for the next 6 minutes, leaving the listener, or this one at least, fairly disappointed. i do give this album some points, don't get me wrong -- it IS Autechre after all -- but of all the Autechre discs i own, i think this is the one i listen to least often."
3,"pretty neat CD, but...","It's neat of the Naxos folks to put together a compilation of all the known Fratreses (if that's the correct plural) together in one place. Each version is different enough so that a complete listen-through doesn't get tiring.The other reviews of this CD have tended to focus on the beauty and spirituality of Pärt's music- I totally agree with those comments- he writes incredible music. The quality of the performances on this CD, however, is a little suspect at times. Particulary in the string quartet version of Fratres, there is some seriously shaky intonation... The chords don't exactly ring like they should in order to transcend space and time- qualities for which Pärt's music is known.Overall, it's an acceptable CD, but it could have been better. I think there are some good recordings of the quartet version out there, but I'm not certain."
2,needs some professional mastering,"The orchestra is out of tune on several of the pieces, which is too bad because the composer is genius - just performances are lacking. And the recording itself is very thin. This CD could have used a professional mastering job, sorry to say."
4,excellent introduction to part at a bargain price,"this is a wonderul little CD- you would think that 6 variations of the same piece would get tedious, but each has a character of it's own. breaking them up are the jaunty ""summa for strings"" and heatbreaking cantus for benjamin britten. this compares well with the ECM recordings from the mid 80's, and is a bargain at the price."
3,Articulating sacredness,"3 1/2 starsThe repetition throughout the 6 variations on this theme do become tiresome upon further listening to this album as a whole; however, the different implementations of this theme are justified due to the subtle changes found throughout that somehow make this minimalist theme flourish with progressive subtlties. The interspersed 3 remaining tracks do a great deal to enhance the album on the whole, breaking the pace from the profound, yet tiresome thematic experiment. Reforming my belief that modern classical music can still retain a sense of majesty, yet making a spiritual connection the likes no other composer has ventured, Avro Part is for anyone who enjoys the truely intense silence of sacredness, but this album should be an unlikely starting point."
3,Oy vey intonation...,"Well I like the idea of this CD, making a compilation of all the Fratres', but as usual with most naxos recordings, the string players are rather out of tune (especially the cellos). If you buy naxos recordings go for orchestral recordings and pianists (like the Shostakovich preludes and fugues is good). In the end though its probably worth the 7 bucks because the repetoire is so cool."
3,eehhhhh.,"not bad, but kinda grew out of this pretty quick. but definitely better than the studio stuff."
3,Cell Biology for Middle Schoolers,"This book is written with one column, 12point Times New Roman font. I don't think it was intended to be given to post-college graduates, but I am using it for a graduate-type class. No real complaints except the book tends to be bias. It was explaining two hypotheses for the evolution of introns and was clearly biased against introns possible being mobile genetic elements that infected the cells. If it's biased, it is not science."
3,Lengthy understanding,"Granted this book is well written, i feel that there is a lot of jargon that detracts from the overall understanding of the topics.However it supplies an excellent review of key topics and explains them very nicely within most chapters."
4,Just the Same as the Newer Edition,If you want to save money - the 2nd edition is almost 100% the same as the 3rd. It is easy to find the differences.It is an okay book for cell Biology. Some books provide better info on certain subjects. Good luck with the class!
3,"""Essential"" only","I was a bit disappointed by this book which was recommended for my medical school course. It's written at a very introductory level; the over simplification doesn't always provide more clarity.Alberts has a different book called ""The Cell"", which is 3 times as long, and I believe has greater clarity. I have taken to skimming this more detailed book, which I find to be a better resource and will surely be a better reference in the future."
4,Essential Cell Biology,Very good cell and molecular biology book. It is in-depth and specific. The only problem is the uninviting font.
1,garbage,"the seller somehow ""accidentally"" mistook the words first edition and claimed he had the second edition....and on top of that, even if it was a mistake, the final date for me to receive it was march 5. on march 4 i got an email saying it was the wrong edition, and by that time the semester was almost finished. waste of time."
2,Not Good,"Wanted to order a book, but didn't read the tricky fine print that said it was a C.D. Which was really annoying because who would ever sell a terrible quality C.D. for $70. That is a ridiculous rip off"
3,"Battery for ""ancient"" Panasonic Phone set","Have been satisfied with several LENMAR batteries for laptop computers. Decided on purchase by recognized brand and good price.In use for month and a half with no problem. It is doing its ""job"" which is what I hoped for.Received promptly and in good condition."
3,Great for begginners--NOT for advanced or anyone who has any brains,"This book was written for people that have no clue what a computer, a video camera, or a movie is. It is written for the very inexperienced or novice--the people that should not be making movies to begin with.But it is packed with information a 7 year old or 88 year old can understand, and it is 95% close to being accurate. I guess if one needs to start somewhere, here it is, but after reading it, please do not make your first movie to send to festivals, make as many as you can, practice, practice, practice, then get a real book. Digital Filmmaking 101, Digital Moviemaking, Independent Filmmakers Manual, and so forth before getting into the movie making world--please."
3,falls short of expectations,"this book is great as a motivational tool that can be read in a matter of hours but that's about as far as its success will take you. If you truly want to feel prepared for an interview and only want to spend money on one book I wouldn't recomend this one. Instead take a little more time and read The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Perfect Interview, so-so title when it comes to ego but much more informative for your unemployed buck."
2,There are better books on the subject out there...,"This book is a very quick read, just a couple of hours. It is mostly motivational with little of substance. Most of the book is simple common sense. His top **Insider** places to find job opportunities are the newspaper and Internet job sites. Wow, hadn't thought of those.Skip this one and find something better."
5,Excellent Book!,"During my job search, I did all the common job search strategies, like posting my resume on job search boards, submitting my resume in response to the classified ads in the newspaper and asking your parents for a job within the company. Times have changed and you need to adapt to the changing job market.I would highly recommend ""10 Insider Secrets to a Winning Job Search"" to anyone searching for a job. This book is easy reading and outlines proven strategies to successfully land a job in any job market you are up against.This book is a must have and will be beneficial in your job search. As a testimony, this book has been proven to be very resourceful and beneficial in landing my current job.Thank you Todd."
3,Good book overall but does not cover important fundementals,"This is a good book overall. However it does not cover several important fundemental topics. First, the book does not cover salary negotion tactics during an interview. Second, this bookdoes not include enough sample follow-up letters. Third, this book only focuses on the traditional person-to person interviews.Todd does not discuss panel interviews, telephone interviews,and dinner interviews. However, I did implement the ""express mail"" tatic he sugessted. Also, the book has a great variety of interview questions. I was asked several of the questions during my last two interviews!"
5,Interview Tips Were a Winner!,"Thanks to the tips in this book, I finally got a job. While some of the information was common sense, I really learned from the section on how to answer difficult interview questions. Also, one of the most helpful tips I found was how to prepare a script for introducing myself during the first few seconds of the interview.I never realized how important those first 90 seconds were of the interview until I read this book. Once I prepared a script for introducing myself, I became much more confident and soon after got a job offer. Thanks Todd for your valuable tips."
5,Banjo music by the Best!,"This was a gift for my son Chancy, he has been playing the banjo for about 3 years now. This was on his wish list. The look on his face when he opened his present was priceless. It was a very Merry Christmas for us. Thank You soooo Much, Angie"
3,Money better spent elsewhere......................,"For the price of this book, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. The book does contain some good information, but only if the author went into more depth with each subject. I know that would have increased the size of the book, but maybe making a ""Book1"" and ""Book2.""If you're that bored, than by all means, you can skim through this book, but as for a reference, I don't think so. After skimming through the various subjects and material, I haven't opened the book since!This book would be better used for a person who wants to learn the basics of active electronic devices, but not to be used as a guide to do actual design, etc.Very limited use of equations gave this book a good head start. As a book mainly used for reading, I wouldn't want to have a ton of equations like your grandpa's EE books."
5,Click and purchase this book you won't be disappointed!,"Alright, alright, I have just clicked-in my order, I don't have the book yet, but I know how amazing it is going to be! Bill Wright is one of the best photographer out there at the moment. If you believe in the Human Spirit, in the beauty within, in the goodness that transcend from one being, you won't be disappointed; now if you don't believe in all that, get yourself Bill Wright's People Lives and you will!"
5,Great item for homeschoolers,I homeschool my son who is autistic and adhd and this book is working out great for him to catch up to his grade level.
3,"Good Drill, good value","I'm using this book for homeschool, and while it's a good cheap worksheet book, I want to say that while at ten bucks, 313 pages of worksheets is a good deal as far as I'm concerned, this book does not offer instruction, so it is best used for review and practice."
4,Great!,"We're homescooling all our kids, and this is a nice thick book for the price!At times, we had to take a break and practice more in a certain area, before continuing with the book.Great mix of things covered!"
5,Perfect Ending,It took me YEARS to find all the books in this series and by the time I finally did I re-read all the books again before reading this last one. It's hard to rave on without spoiling the surpise but I think that by the time I opened this book I was feeling that Indigo's character had really developed in some ways over the course of the series but that in other ways she still seemed very juvenile for all that she is really old after all her adventures. I loved that this book allowed Indigo to push past these barriers. Absolutely put in the effort to get all the books for this series.
5,very impressed,"I received my book 4 December and was very pleased with it. When I first looked for it on Amazon, it was noted as being out of print and unknown availability. Next time (about a week later),there it was! And only one!! Thank you for letting me be the lucky one. It's in beautiful shape and I'm very, very happy with it and the seller. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!"
4,"Sadie Starr beading with seed beads, gems and cabachons","I have enjoyed the book tremendously. It is easy to understand and I have learned alot from it. It was in excellent condition and I received my order in the time frame it was promised to me.Thank you,Deborah Mann"
3,Not even a third-choice,"There aren't many reasons for getting this budget-priced set now that multiple recordings are available at mid-price.Admittedly, this was my first recording, which I bought about six or seven years ago when I didn't know much about Elgar's music .... I enjoyed the work, but was less than thrilled with the choral passages--they sounded muffled and distant. On the other hand, the soloists are all decent, with Best as the Priest in part one and the Angel of the Agony in part two the clear standout among the soloists.If you're a particular fan of any of the soloists here, this may be worth exploring, particularly since it's at a budget price..."
3,just ok,"We just got this toy. If I had known how unresponsive it was I would not have bought it. It takes an adult to make the noise, and only if you hit it hard, just the right way."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"This is a very cute toy, with lots of bright colors and appealing shapes. But first of all, when it arrived, I was surprised by how small it was - smaller than a regular dinner plate. Secondly, you have to hit the little bumps pretty hard to make any noise, and my one-year-old daughter can't really do that, especially with the hammer. I like that it was all soft, and that she could bang on it and make noise, but because she has to hit the thing so hard, she lost interest in it quickly. Maybe it would be better for older kids, but for one and under, at least from my experience, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Not worth the price,"My child liked the noises this item produced but unfortunately we had to push the buttons for him since the sensors are very difficult to hit. I couldn't even make them go off with the hammer, I had to push the tiny buttons with my fingers. Overall, not worth the price."
4,This is the shoe!,"Great fit, great feel, may be too low for running on my bad knee, but should be great for the courts. Only concern is that the logo looks a lot like another brand's logo, no prob for me. But in all the shoe looks clean, but will be hard to keep that way...lol"
5,Start feeling great!,I knew I was mineral deficient. I have always taken vitamins but realized I was not getting the minerals I need from my diet. After taking Mega Minerals for 2 weeks I feel great! My workouts don't seem to bother me as much. Minerals like iodine are essential to a well balanced metabolism.
4,GREAT WALLET FOR THE MONEY,I got this 1 month ago and love it! But it does not have alot of atm card or credit card slots but does have an I.D. window. it is a cowhide type of leather and is very fuctional. It has no logos or special disigns on it. Overall this item gets a 4.
2,bad lining,Nice wallet but the lining ripped after 2 days of use. The slots are good size for credit cards. They need to use thicker material for lining.
4,Song Listings,Either the cover is incorrect for song listings or song listings are incorrect Sonny Boy Williamson (John Lee Williamson) did not record these tunes Sonny Boy Williamson II (Rice Miller) did record these tunes.
3,Rather dull look at Third Reich,"Speer's memoir of his life during the Third Reich is an extremely dull read. The first half, when he was only Hitler's architect, has him going over buildings in minute detail, with hardly anything else mentioned. When he becomes Minister of Armaments, he totally shifts interest to citing figures on production of material, and how he criticized the Reich leadership for their ineptitude in fighting the war. He spends copious amounts of time repeating that the various leaders and their infighting stalled production, and ruined Germany's chances for the war. He also spends a good portion of the book describing his meetings with Hitler. However, these were daily occurances, and Speer seems to want to recall every note and memorandum he sent to Hitler for his approval. Only at the end of the book when he describes his time post-Hitler and his captivity under the Allies is the book get interesting. Other than that, it is a rather dreary look at the Third Reich."
2,Very dry.,"Inside the Third Reich makes for a dry reading. Speer constantly talks about architecture for pages and pages considering that most of them resulted in models. Then, he'll endlessly talk about routine daily affairs during his time as Minister of Armaments. I couldn't keep patience after halfway through the book because I realized that I wasn't learning anything new or interesting. Once in a while, Speer will have something good to say before disappearing to banalities. The best part of the book is the first paragraph in Chapter 17 entitled ""Commander in Chief Hitler,"" and Speer perfectly summed up Hitler. That was exactly what I was thinking. Elsewhere, the pictures provided in the book are quite awful. It's either murky or dark to see. I couldn't really appreciate most of them. All in all, Inside the Third Reich is an incredible journey of boredom."
2,a little dry,"I'll be up front and say I never finished this book. I have about 70 reviews here and this is the only one on a book I never finished. It wasn't that it was terrible or lacking in information, it's just that it was so, so boring and superficial. All the encounters with Hitler had all the emotion of checking out a book from the library. The behind the scenes may have come later, but by a third of the way through I wasn't going to wait around to find out. Plus it was hard to overcome the feeling that there was no way this wasn't going to be a self-serving attempt by the author to restore his public image. Again, I didn't finish, so take my review for what it's worth, but it's rare that I read that far on a book and then find it so dull I lose all interest."
2,so-so,"Yes, this book is unique. Yes, because of the privileged position of the author it affords you a rare glimpse into important historical events. My rating, however, evaluates the book itself, how well it is written and how much thought went into it. I do not, by the way, object to the author's self-justification. Everyone indulges himself in this sort of thing continuously and it would be very naive to expect an autobiography not to. I DO object to the book's lack of insight into the psychological motivation of its principal subject (Albert Speer), to its superficiality, and to its banality.And despite my two-star rating I DO recommend that you read it. If nothing else, certain parallels between Hitler's Germany, as Speer describes it, and George W. Bush's America (especially his political exploitation of the events of September 11) are interesting and striking (as well as, of course, alarming)."
3,Not a good book for pleasure reading!,This book had some very interesting points in it about WWII but I don't recommed it if your not into all the details of the war. It had some interesting things about Hitler and his hench men also. All books have strong and weak points but this book is just to in depth to much.
1,don't trust everything you read,"I pitty anyone who by now does not realize that this account based on albert speer's diary is completely altered to conform with the popular majority mainstreem trend of historical accounts on the third reich.mr. speer admits himself that someone was paid to put his diary together in book form,but to alter or ommit anything that isn't in keeping with the popular trend of thought concearning adolph hitler and national socialism.he has been aproached,but refused to submit his diary for this very reason.I love some of these reveiws that praise such backdated ill-reasearched and ill-informed works like the rise and fall of the third reich.they make themselves sound like beginners in this field of interest.please,just try to do yourself a favor and update you third reich info,you might be shocked at what you discover.try reading some david irving works like hitler's war."
3,Cheaply made,The jacket is awsome. End of story. The photo reproduction is horrendous. The paper is made from the dregs. All in all it is a waste of Albert Speer's works.
5,"A CAPTIVATING, ENGAGING STORY","In 1989, during my Peace Corps service, I came across the book ""INSIDE THE THIRD REICH"" quite by surprise and could not put it down. I read it for hours nonstop.The story that Speer relates here of his life and career in the Third Reich, first as Hitler's architect, and later as the Minister for Armaments and War Production (1942-1945) is gripping and compelling. You get a real, tangible sense of what the people (e.g. Goering, Hess, Himmler, Goebbels, Bormann, etc.) were like who played key roles in Nazi Germany.This memoir does not read like a dry retelling of historical events. You feel yourself a witness to an unfolding drama of deceit, treachery, genocide, and war in the heart of the Third Reich. All of these events may seem incredible as Speer describes them. But they happened, and in reading ""INSIDE THE THIRD REICH"", you see how it was that Germany was led down the path to destruction by its political leadership."
5,My Little Pony,"Arrived in excellent condition. Granddaughters, ages 4 and 5, were delighted with them and loved combing the pretty manes."
4,Just like the title says - Design Patterns Explained,"In my humble opinion, I think this should be the first design pattern book to read for beginners. The GoF book can be a bit overwhelming for the newbie.The book is well written and easy to follow. The coverage of each pattern is short and the explanation is straight forward. The diagrams and side-notes help to illustrate what is going on. After reading this book, you should be ready to tackle the GoF book."
2,Dont go overboard in patterns,"I dont think you should go overboard crazy about design patterns. To me, knowing good Object Oriented design is what it is all about. With good OO design - patterns should follow naturally from the code.Obviously, I see the value of patterns, where they create the possibility of creating a framework or headlines for talking about code. But when some people take patterns to be the solution to everything I am bit sceptical.The book does a good job of explaining many of the patterns we know from the GOF text. And it is easier to read than the gang of four text. And there are also many nice chapters on good OO design.So, All in all I should give this book 4 stars. But I am provoked by (all) pattern books that elevates patterns to be the eight wonder of the world - therefore I deduct two stars.-Simon"
2,"The Code Examples Still Do Not Exist as of Aug29,'05","After getting halfway through the book, I found that there were no code exaples. Not compiling well is a much smaller issue, but just leaving them out makes this book worth half what I though it was as well as false advertising. I went to the books official discussion site and found that this had been notes as early as March 15. I've included the relevant post's from the discussion site.TonyHa Posted 03-15-2005 05:29 AMIn the Second edition of the book, in the Preface page xxxi under paragraph Code examples. It say that for the code exampls please go tohttp://................ , butwhen I goto this URL, the ""Code Fragments"" is grey out, there is no code framgments links.[...]"
2,Why explain?,"After going over this book I had this rhetoric question: `Why did the original need so much ""explaining""?` Of course Design Patterns by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides is not a light reading and I had to go a couple of times (and still do) over certain aspects in order to get a good understanding. And still the substance and depth of the ""original"" are incomparable with present material. I admit, the book under review presentation is clear, but the concepts are fairly basic while the examples did not give me the most ""natural"" feeling."
2,"I'm glad there's a 2nd edition, the first one needed help","Caveats: Although I have an MS in computer science this is my first book on design patters. Having said that...The best thing about this book is the title.I found the first edition of this book somewhat disapointing. It seemed to drag on terribly slowly in places. It seems that the authors relate much more to teaching and haven't quite hit their stride in writing on the same subjects. Interestingly, the most effective chapters were the shortest, those at the end of the first edition. They seemed to be little more than outlines hurridly gathered for press and they were the most concise and effective and not bogged down with tedious discussion.The book's layout was also diapointing. Among other things I didn't care for the margin notes. They were distracting and there were far too many to be effective.I'm looking forward to comparing other books on the subject.May subsequent editions shed more light."
2,Buy another book,"Although I haven't read any other book on patters, I'll advise against this book. The organization and format of the book is not good. You can find better explanations online - try Wikipedia. Also, this book covers only 10 patters or so - much less than GoF."
1,waste of money,"it's just Ed siting at his desk talking..might be useful if you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, but if you have the slightest clue it's a complete waste. forex for dummies is less money and WAY better."
5,Awesome Kids Book,"This was my favorite book as a kid, I still have it and pull it out sometimes. Quick read for a bedtime story-I like to dream about candy!"
3,he writes to cover for himself,john dean writes this book because he feels like he has to let the public know what has happened in his work experience at the White House. He thinks he has to write it for his own survival.
3,Darling Buds of May,"I'm trawling for string quartet music which sounds so great you want to play it, but easy enough to have a bash at if you're not very good. The very last track on the disc, piece 2 of ""3 pieces"" (no prize for the unimaginative name!) sounds like just such a piece for me. It is only a couple of minutes long, and I think would bear a complete repeat from beginning to end. From an English composer it's a vibrant English seasidy quartet with a syncopated beat, conjuring 1950's England, Darling buds of May, Just William, and my old feller's 1950's holidays in Llandudno as a teenager listening to the pier orchestra (aka the Liverpool Phil in disguise). The other pieces on the CD, including Londonderry Air, are rather more challenging than my simple tastes expected, and I shall reserve judgement until I have heard them a bit more. My rating of three stars may be unduly mean but I was not allowed to submit a review without picking a figure so I've just gone in the middle."
2,I bought this because of the Mig29.,"A fine video on the US and Canadian Mig29 tour during 1991. Starts with Mig aircraft history by Jay Miller. All video is about Mig29's display in that tour, but not the full display."
4,And when she was good she was very very good.,"No vamping here, just good clean adult comedy. Van (Clark Gable) is happily married & in love with his wife, Linda played by Myrna Loy. But he can't survive in business without his loyal & indispensible secretary, Whitey played by Jean Harlow. A secret business plan means they spend most of their waking hours together. She is at Van's beck & call 24 hours a day much to the chagrin of Whitey's boyfriend, Dave, a small part played by a very young Jimmy Steward, & Linda. Whitey is so beautiful, fun to be with & smart, how could Van not be having an affair with her?But he's not. He's faithful not even considering it until the complications pile on the misunderstandings as they do in 1930's romantic comedies. Linda is about to leave him & Whitey confronts her. Whitey loves Van but nothing has happen between them & she saves Van's & Linda's marriage. Presumably Whitey then returns to spend more time with poor Dave. Highly entertaining from the classic era."
2,Rehash,"This edition is a very well presented two disc collection. I gave it an extra point for that. But it's a rehash of essentially the same collection found on Lost in Space. I received this for Xmas 2003 and, what a disappointing return to, what must be the most depressing singer the industry has to offer. Sadly ironic, my same friend bought me the normal version last year. Will I need meds to revive myself from her dark world? Aimee must have a cult following, explaining why she's not seen much in the mainstream? Her voice IS beautiful, but that's where, IMO, it ends. Her on screen personality echoes her lyrics - sad, lonely? Several female vocalists come to mind that actually provide a positive feeling. Your choice."
4,"Surprising, assured, moving","This isn't Aimee Mann's best work, and it scared off a lot of listeners and reviewers. Yet after about a month or so of listening to it, its quietude set in - it's a cold, spare album offering up some of Mann's wryest, wisest songs on loneliness and isolation. ""This is How It Goes"" is devastating, ""Invisible Ink"" is gorgeously written (""I feel like a ghost trying to move your hands over some ouigi board in the hopes you might spell out my name"" is not a lyric written by an artist in a slump), ""Humpty Dumpty"" and ""Pavlov's Bell"" are fast paced and clever. The record broaches your darkest emotions even as it seems to push you away. The live cuts on the second disc on the special addition are nothing special, but the b-sides are terrific - they showcase a playful sound Mann has that doesn't belong on the record."
5,Think of this as the written Steve Martin in pentameter,"Next time you want entertainment, forget the movies and TV. Get thee to a bookstore or Amazon. Skip past the so-called humor books, and go directly to the...gasp...poetry section. Don't be afraid. You may have a difficult time finding it, but once there, the name Dean Blehert will be prominently displayed on the bindings of several unique and hilarious books. Pick any one(s) you want, but be certain to include his latest in your trove. ""Please, Lord,et.al."" is not only a poet's primer, but very tasty brain candy for those who simply like to laugh. But please have a care: Blehert's books can be addicting, with no known antidote! Consider yourself warned!!!"
5,Skillful and long-overdue recasting of the poetic product.,"Skillful, irreverent and long-overdue recasting of the poetic product. Blehert is for wordsmiths who like having fun. Like Willard Espy, this former Cornell professor of English likes to dust off the stodgy stuff now and then and play. Play, hell. He parties! His satire and parody ex-plode like popcorn, and the wit involved makes the cerebrum smile."
5,"A polished, and warm voice! GREAT set of hits!","This is a great set of Ronnie Dove's music.He had 20 songs chart between 1964 and 1969,this c.d. contains his 16 highest charted songs.I had bought this ""collectables"" label c.d. first,from their own company, ""Oldies.com"".But after reading reviews of its lesser quality,and really wanting a great copy of Ronnie Dove's greatest hits,I also bought the ""Stardust label"" c.d. from Amazon,(yellow cover, Ronnie Dove in red type).I now own both, and both contain the same songsjust in a different order.I've listened to them both several times.There does seem to be a very slight difference in clearityon this particular ""collectables"" c.d.Who knows if all of ""Collectables"" Ronnie Dove's greatest hits copies are like this.Perhaps some aren't, and thats NOT to say ""Collectables"" copy isn't any good,but I do prefer ""Stardust"" clearity on this one.The music makes this a 5 star c.d.All original recordings."
3,Years of searching!,"I have been trying to find this for a long time too, Brenda! I searched the internet years ago for Ronnie Dove and nothing existed then. I forgot about trying again until today! I know I will love this CD because I loved the album as a teenager! I can't wait to hear it again!"
2,"a great singer, almost forgotten","ronnie dove is a great singer, performer, alive, and well in, baltimore, md, at doves nest."
2,A very basic shooter,"Mortyr is a very strange game. The game plays and feels like a straight update of the old ""Castle Wolfenstein"" game. The game's limited 3D engine is the only real difference.It has this real interesting plot: Set in an alternate future, you are a lone soldier determined to thwart Nazi world domination by travelling back in time. But it just sits there, there is no opening cutscene, the game just starts. The weapons are so-so, the damage effects are lame and the sound is bad.Also, the game turns into the predictable ""find the key"" and ""find the hidden switch"" 1st person shooter game. How boring!But you do get to shoot Nazis so it gets an extra star for that."
1,Two Thumbs Down for Mortyr,"The only types of pc games I play are shooter games and I gotta tell you that Mortyr is a waste of money. I mean, it is one boring game. The weapons are uninteresting, there are no puzzles at all, when you've played level 1 and level 2 you've basically seen all there is to see. And the villians are bland and, for the most part, are not challenging and graphics offer nothing new. In other words this game lacks pretty much everything, but most of all it lacks imagination. If you've got $40 bucks to spend then buy UNREAL and/or its sequel Or the new Half-Live Opposing Force game. I've finished them both and can tell you that Mortyr pales in comparison to them and most every other shooter game for that matter going back to the shareware days of DOOM. Save your money."
1,"This game is not fun, it is a waste of money","Mortyr looks good on the box cover, and the description of it has potential but when you install it and play it the disappointment is intense. I have a rocking gaming computer and this game still is lame. The graphics are old school, the gameplay is boring and unchallenging, the software itself is very badly designed, the sound is straight out of Doom 1 DOS version. Don't buy this title, unless you enjoy throwing away your money. Get Half-Life, Kingpin, or Soldier of Fortune if you want a fun, and challenging first person shooter with good graphics and sound. I was really suprised that Interplay, a company that has released some awesome titles in the past, let this one get released."
1,Waste of my money.,"I have used real butter for years. This product is a shabby imitation, at best. It has practically no flavor, didn't taste even close to real butter to me. And if you mix it per instructions, it is extremely watery and has none of the ""texture"" of real butter. It was so disappointing I wouldn't even give it away to the local food bank. I simply threw it all out. It seemed like a healthy idea, but I'd actually rather use nothing at all as a condiment than to use this product."
1,TASTELESS WATER,"I agree with Lynnette Layton, I find this to be totally tasteless.I feel I'm just pouring on yellow water to my food. I also bought the cruet and mixing bottle for ten dollars, and one packet of this in the cruet bottle makes so little, I needed half of it for one ear of corn on the cob. No wonder they only sell it in mass quantities.I feel I 've lost $27. I find the sprinkle bottle to be better."
5,useful butter buds,"I am unable to purchase the ButterBuds Mix on the West Coast and it is worth it to me to order a large stock in order to have them. These are different from the sprinkled version and far superior, in my view. They make excellent butter-lemon sauces, such as you would use with artichoke hearts, yet have almost no calories nor fat. I also use them on cooked vegetables and potatoes. Most important to me is the fact that I can take them in dry form with me backpacking and then mix with water while camping. I can't live without these!"
5,simply great writing,Breem wrote the way today's authors should. His prose and literary style has been unequaled.
4,Excellent story but misrepresentation of history,"Let me start out by saying that this is an excellent novel. Breem tells the story very well, and I was moved by the ending.What Breem doesn't communicate is that the Roman army portrayed in the book is certainly not the one that actually existed during the decline and fall of the empire. During the final century of the empire's decay,the Roman army was composed almost entirely of barbarians in the service of Rome - the legions of Scipio, Caesar, and Marcus Aurelius were long gone and had been replaced by barbarian warriors in Roman service.Still, I highly recommend this book as it is very well written and I enjoyed it greatly."
5,Why can't one give 6/5 stars here?!,"Seriously, why not???I read this book a few years ago, and was simply blown away by how amazing it was. Both in describing battles, and character description/development.I just leafed through it, after reading the review by R.L. Holly ""piper909"" below (have a look), to see if I have the Roman inscription at the end (phew, I did...otherwise, I would have bought another copy in no-time). Having looked through a few of the pages in the middle prompted a decision to re-read it after I'm done with the current book I'm working on, as it made me think, and realize that it's STILL the best book I've ever read!I can think of no better gift to someone whom you REALLY care about...this would be really something I would give from the heart as a gift, as it made me so emotional to read it.Amazon...can we give this book 6/5 stars? :)"
4,Terrific Historical Novel - A little-known gem,"This book (by far Breem's best) is just great. There are imperfections, of course, such as the awkward early Roman Britain part before the Legion is stationed on the Rhine... but overall the mood and tone are wonderful. I really feel for the Roman commander who has the nearly impossible task of stopping a giant German migration when even his local population base won't believe its real or provide meaningful support. I loved it. I took it with me on a cruise and I hardly left the deck chair."
4,"Excellent, but relentlessly downbeat","It would be inaccurate to say I enjoyed this novel. Rather, I was drawn into it by its fascinating picture of imperial decay and a sense of what life in Roman Germany might have been like. Breem wrote well, but as others have noted, the protagonist is a cold and remote figure, even to his closest friends. Read this on a warm evening, because otherwise you might catch a chill."
2,Undisclosed Fiction,"I received this book several days ago. I had been anxiously awaiting its arrival. I had been reading articles about the battle of Teutoburg Forest and when I searched for a book about the subject, this one kept popping up. It has great reviews by readers. When I read the item description and I read the word ""novel"" I was suspicious that it was fiction but I could find nothing stating that it was fiction. Well...much to my dissapointment it is historical fiction. Any reader looking for factual, non fiction history stay away from this. It is written in a first person format and has absolutely nothing to do with Teutoburg Forest. It's set in Britania on Hadrian's wall.The author has clearly mastered the knowledge required to write an historical fiction NOVEL but presents nothing about actual events for the avid history student. I rated it two stars because the way it is presented on Amazon is very deceptive.Amazon needs to more clearly label whether a book is fiction or not."
1,Blah,Extremely stale and old fashioned writing make this a bible-like read. Skip this one. There's a reason you couldn't find it before this reprint. Once you put it down you'll never pick it up again. Reminicent of your high school history text book.
4,The title says it all,"Tempest & Sunshine - Night & Day... polar opposites. Nicknames a father gives his two daughters.Tempest, refusing to take second place, and Sunshine... just that, a ray of Sunshine and breath of fresh air. Tempest does everything she can to conquer the men who come into her path - successful and sure of herself. Sunshine, steady and true, suffers the consequences of her sister's scheming..... how will it end?For MJH fans... it is a must read."
1,Pathetic and full of mistakes,"I have been teaching high school math for over 20 years and occasionally teach adult education. I bought this book because it was inexpensive and I wanted to refresh my understanding of subjects other than math.First, the math section is full of mistakes and even has wrong information (they claim the side of a regular polygon equals its radius...this is true only of regular hexagons and not other polygons!). There are practice questions with wrong answers, too.I started to read the Earth Science section and it includes Creation Theory and not any relevant geologic theories (I have a degree in Geology).Overall, this is pathetic. Poorly selected material, poorly edited. Stay away!"
1,not soft like most cottonelle,"When I saw the name cottonelle, I expected soft TP. This is not soft at all. The prints on the TP are maybe cute for kids to look at, but the quality ends there."
1,they cancelled it without telling me.,"They canceled this without telling me why. Then a day later, they said it was being discontinued. I wish I would have known so I could stock up.Poor customer relations."
4,This is the only place that I can find this product!,I get more positive comments from guests and I took one roll to work and they raved about it. My 10 year old granddaughter loves the graphics. Please don't stop selling the product!ksb
5,"Excellent story, excellent version","This was not my first reading of King Lear - I read it some time ago. The epic tragedy tells the story of an aging king who decides to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, based upon which of the three best professes her love to him. I'm not giving anything away to say that the King has made an error in judgement in deciding to base his decision on flattery. This edition of the classic tale is laid out in a way that is easy to read, and with a number of very helpful notes that help the reader to navigate the story. It was a required school text but I think my teacher made a wise decision in specifying the Folger Edition."
3,product shorted in boxes,this is a wonderful product I have used it for many years and it is the best taco seasoning ever. but 2 out of four cases were short product
4,great starter seasoning,"THE CHI-CHI RESTAURANTE SEASONING MIX IS A GREAT STARTER FOR MANY MEXICAN AND ITALIAN DISHES.TACOS, BURRITOES, TACO SALADS , MEATSAUCE , AND MEAT BALLS HAVE ALL BEEN ENJOYED BY OURFAMILY. POSSIBLE MEATLOAF THIS WEEK.GREAT STUFF"
3,I love it..............,"I love seasoning and am disappointed that they does not carry it in their South Texas stores. It is less harsh than many seasonings that I have tried, and everyone who has ""my"" chili complements me on it. Too bad I have to order a whole package of 18 in order to have it."
5,Chi-Chi's Mix Makes the BEST Tacos and Fajitas!,"In the past I purchased Chi-Chi's Restaurant mix at my usual grocery store, then I could only find it at Meijer, and now the only place I can find it is on-line. I used the mix to make tacos, I tried it for fajitas and now I also use it in tortilla soup. It adds a great taste to any Mexican dish. My sister in-law tried my tacos and now she orders on line as well.Give it a try. Your tacos will never be the same!"
1,i have to disagree...,"unlike the previous reviews, i found it to be very bland and lacking flavor. initially i was excited when i opened th pouch as the scent was awesome. after browning the meat and adding the seasoning per the directions, i found the meat to be very bland and basically under seasoned. i ended up supplimenting it with my standard taco seasoning that comes in a blue pouch. this chi chi's seasoning did have a nice little kick of heat from the chilis, but as far as flavor i found it lacking in this department. it just added a bit of heat (in the spice sense of the word) to the meat, thats about it. i am rating this based on flavor alone, as the amazon service was A+ as usual."
5,Glad to have found this!,"We used to buy this in the store, but, for some reason they stopped selling this in our area. Well, I was happy to find it on Amazon. It tastes so much better than most taco seasoning mixes. If you are looking for something different (in a good way!) give this a try!"
5,So many uses,I had bought some of this seasoning mix at the grocery store to make tacos and my son and I both loved it. I then found these on Amazons Subscribe and Save and paid less than a buck a package for them. I gave some to my grandmother and my aunt. They used it on brisket and found it delicious. This is now a staple in my household. It has simple ingredients and great taste. I highly recommend and I will enjoy adding this to different meals.
3,Contains MSG,"I used only one packet out of the entire box of 24 when I discovered that it contained MSG. This information should be made available before you purchase. The taste was OK - if you are expecting any tomato flavor, there is none."
3,"One Big Hit, The Others?","They will be remembered for Popsicles And Icicles and little else. Twelve songs in mono, only track 13 is stereo."

1,Terribly written,"I feel like everybody loves this book because it contains the words ""World War II"", ""Love"", and ""Stories"" in the title. Sure, the stories themselves are nice, but there are hardly any details. This reads like a poorly written book report from a 4th grader because of the redundant sentence structure and lack of depth! I thought the most interesting parts of this book were the pictures, and halfway through I just started skipping the text and going straight for them. I was surprised that there weren't any stories about nurses falling for their patients, or forbidden loves, like an American falling for a German or something. There was a story about an Italian girl marrying an American soldier that I thought was interesting but the delivery lacked life. Don't waste your money on this book, go to a library and read it if you must."
2,Nice stories...terrible writing!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I had hoped to read the stories in the couple's own words, but instead found small quotes from the couples and horrible choppy sentences from Mr. King.The author was redundant and uninteresting. This book would have been wonderful had Mr. King just written what the couples had told him."
5,Nicely done book,"This book is filled with beautiful pictures of imaginative designs for the garden. Can recommend this book for anyone looking for something a little out of the ordinary,"
3,Hyperactive Poppers Calm Down; Write Better Songs,"Taken from the forthcoming Kill The Last Romantic, 'Til The Day sees Easyworld writing a good, old-fashioned love song. Catchy and inoffensive, with a perfect piano backing singer Dav Ford's voice, it makes for pleasent, but hardly exciting listening. Backed up with an excellent country-ish B-side in the form of Heaven Knows You Will and a cover of the classic Luka, this is hardly must-own material, but well worth a few quid."
3,not what I expected,"Hmm, the jar says to refrigerate after opening, but the olives are in such a heavy concentration of oil (not the vinegar-ish liquid of other olives) that the liquid congeals into this yellowish paste. They taste greasy and look really strange now. Before I put them in the fridge, they were very good. I love this type of olive when it's been roasted, like on bruschetta."
5,"A First rate adventure, involving and thrilling.","This ""last drive"" is a first rate read. You share every colorful, exciting, crazy adventure with these two likeable authors, as if you were with them. The writing is crisp, clean and riveting. Why Hollywood hasn't made this into a film or TV mini is a real mystery. And, most amazingly, the places they visited haven't changed; their past becomes your present."
5,A favourite,"I loved this book, it's one of my absolute favourite travel books and I've recommended it to so many people. The writing is entertaining and keeps you hooked and the relationships between the participants makes for a great read."
5,One of my lifetime favorites,"I read who needs a road? several times back in Junior High School and never got tired of it. When I recently unearthed my old copy, I got back into the adventure right away. I am very glad this classic is back in print."
5,A great read. Get it now - you won't be disappointed!,"Anyone who has ever traveled anywhere by car (and who hasn't) will absolutely love the adventures and misadventures of Stephens, Podell and crew on this over-the-road around the world trip in a 60's era Toyota Land Cruiser. It's amazing they came back alive!Every bit as entertaining as the best of Cahill and Bryson but less long-winded, the adventure is related in a page-turning series of concisely written and entertaining passages that will have you howling with laughter and empathizing in pain.You will love this book!"
1,What were they thinking?,I'm sorry but this is the worst cd I have bought in the past 3 years. I heard them on headbangers ball....the song sounded good so I bought the album. Completely disapointed! The lyrics are pointless and sound ignorant.
2,Meh...cross between a weak Tool CD and Nine Inch Nails,"This album is nothing new on the ears. I guess for a ""decent"" Wes Boreland band...it's heads above the rest. But shelve this CD in with the rest of the million alternative/machine metal (??) bands and it's a one listen wonder. I dunno...I can honestly say having listened to the whole CD while enganging in a poker game, I can't think of any tracks where I thought 'damn, this song is cool'.....all songs seem like they've been played by other bands before. It's good background music, but nothing I would jam in my car."
4,Good combination,"We already know who's playing and what musical background they have. It's obvious with such projects that the artists are in it for the fun. They don't have to prove nothing, they already did. The great thing about this CD is that it grabs your ears and just won't let go of them.I own a lot of rock/metal bands. Limp B. Tool, NIN, Perfect Circle, Qotsa, Foofighters etc, etc. Cruel world is one of those albums which I listen to at least once per two weeks and that's a lot considering my extremely large collection. Just get this album, you won't be disappaointed, be sure to get the edition with the Dvd."
3,New Direction,"This new direction of Borland's reminds me of a mix between Gravity Kills, Stabbing Westward and Hed (pe) He writes some really cool stuff.It is an interesting album, worth taking a listen at the very least. There are a few tracks that have really grown on me and a few like ""Mark"" that are indeed pit worthy but not as cool to me as tracks like ""New Hunger"" and the tile track ""Cruel Melody.""-B"
4,Inspiring,"Olah's intellectual enthusiasm shines through the pages of his book. In telling his life story, he manages to also convey well his ceaseless curiosity; a never ending search for new and unexpected subtleties in chemistry.He writes for a broad audience. No degree in chemistry required. He shows how chemistry in general, and his work in particular, has practical applications, that can impact everyday lives, like better fuel efficiency in cars, and lower pollution.Perhaps the best hope for this book is that it can inspire students still undecided about their majors to seriously consider chemistry."
4,Good collection for early readers,"I bought this book for my son who is in first grade. He has grown with this book - from the stories where some of the words are replaced by pictures, to the riddles and jokes, to complete stories of Frog and Toad and Morris the Moose. Most importantly - he picks up this book now and reads for pleasure.My one complaint is that the book seems to be organized backwards - the easier reading is in the back, the harder is in the front.The same applies to the Ready-Set-Read and Laugh anthology. Good collections and my kids enjoy reading them."
2,"Abridged titles, a disappointment.","It's a cute collection, but I was most excited about the Morris the Moose story... only to find out that it is abridged, as I believe many of the stories in here are. It's okay, but not the full versions of the original stories. I really wanted Morris Has a Cold, as my own copy from my childhood is somewhat tattered, only to find that it is only about half the pages as the original."
5,Grandma Loves Books,"One of our grandchildren is just beginning to learn to read. Filled with beautiful illustrations, this book is a great tool that will hopefully make the learning process fun."
3,disappointed,"I LOVE David Eddings books, but this one fell flat. I'll read the third, and will probably buy it (in paperback) to keep my personal library complete, but am not expecting miracles from it, because the first two were letdowns. In his other books, one or two characters have the dry, sarcastic wit that is so enjoyable from him. However, in this series, ALL the characters have those comments, on almost every page and every situation. At that point its no longer wit. Also, that is the only depth they're given. It is repetitive, as everything has to be told from multiple viewpoints. Wait for the paperback, and even then, you may want to borrow it from the Library."
2,Not Up to Standard,This series reads like the books I would have written if I was writing a parody of the Eddings' works.
2,Nothing New Here,"This book continues another Eddings series that is eerily like all his others. You have to wonder if Eddings has had an original idea for characters and storyline since The Belgariad. How many times do we have to have the same bantering dialogue with the same or similar characters? How many times do we have to have cute child god/goddesses who want to be hugged and kissed? How many times do we have to methodically plod from country to country on a mythical continent with the same group of characters spouting the same old tired dialogues?I have read every Eddings series (Belgariad, Malloreon, Elenium, and Tamuli) and this one is pretty much the same. In fact, it is not even as good as those. I could barely make it through this book and I would not recommend it or this series to anyone who hasn't read those other superior series I mentioned above and is just starving for more of the same."
1,Truly awful,"Here are a couple of authors (and their incompetent editors) that seem unable to read the writing on the wall. Flogging a dead horse would be the kindest interpetation that one could put on this piece of rubbish.As a former fan (I relished the Belgariad, the Malloreon and even the epic adventures of Sir Sparhawk) I find it incomprehensible that the Eddings could sink so far so quickly.Constantly trying to be coy, the writing would better suit protagonists that resemble Barbie and her entourage rather than the the characters in the text.At the risk of sounding like the obviously past-their-prime authors, this potboiler is so 'cute' it makes me want to throw up! I think I'm going to run out and see if I can find something written by Jennifer Lopez!"
3,"Average, not as good as earlier novels","Eddings appears to be cashing in on past successes, and this series is fairly bland. Often entire chapters are simply repeated from another viewpoint (or three!). Not a patch on the Belgariad."
1,dont waste your money,"The Belgariad and The Mallorean are some of my favorite books. The next series was okay. The characters did not change but the story was good. This series sucks on many levels. The witty banter is present but the characters are one dimensional and almost all the same. There is no plot to speak of. They all gather, set up a fort and a natural disaster (1 of four can you guess??earth, air, water, and fire) saves the day. They spend most of the time discussing how the bug people evolve over and over and over again. Okay I get it already!!! There was no intrigue, no trying to figure things out, no quests, no fear that they might lose or that any of the characters were in danger. In short these books had nothing interesting. I had to force my way through the first three books and I have no intention of reading the fourth as I'm pretty sure of what is going to happen and I can probably fill in the dialogue too. I feel totally ripped off."
2,Not what I expected,I want to preface this review with saying that David Eddings is one of my favorite authors. I will continue to buy anything he writes with an expectation of a good book.Having said this - the 2nd and 3rd book in this series did NOT meet with approval. The first book was decent bordering on good but it ended there. I bought all three after they had all been published and must say I was disappointed.If you are new to David Eddings - you may like these. If you don't like them... Do NOT give up on his works!!! Go back to the Belgariad and read the whole series!! This is a VERY good fantasy writer!!
2,"The Dreamers...A Nightmare, At Best","Do yourself a favor, borrow a friends copy of this book. If unavailable, go to the local library(yes, they still exist).This is surely not Eddings at his/her finest.Endless flashbacks, that ultimately lead to a sudden ending. The Dreamers basically disappear, and a being, more powerful than the idiotic gods now exists. The story rambles on and on and on and on........ and then all has to be tied together at the end with the re-appearance of a Dreamer.What a total waste of time, energy and money. Unfortunately, I love Eddings' work and I can almost guarantee that I will read # 3, I just wont buy it.PLEASE D/L Eddings, Don't disappoint me again, I want to be able to fall into your work, not have to struggle my way through it."
2,I have to agree it's a let-down...,"This series is just a re-hash of Edding's ideas from the Belgariad and Elenium sequences--without the originality that made those good. Read the negative reviews below for specifics. The same can be said of ""Redemption of Althalus."" More of the same.I recommend avoiding them and looking to the duo's non-fantasy work, which show real promise. ""Regina's Song"" was an EXCELLENT thriller with an atypical plot and supernatural element. Original, with well-developed characters. The Eddings' should focus their effort to writing more books outside the traditional ""epic fantasy"" vein, as that well has evidently run dry."
1,This can't be written by David Eddings,"I own just about every single book that David Eddings has written. This book was a Christmas gift, and I was so excited to see it under the tree.Unfortunately, I am incredibly disappointed by the caliber of the writing. I am convinced that this book was *NOT* written by David Eddings. Mr. Eddings has been called one of the best authors due to the quality of his writing by Western Mail:""What separates the grown-up authors from the boys is the quality of the writing and David Eddings is one of the best"" -Western MailI don't know who wrote this book but as another reviewer noted, it seems a bad parody of Mr. Eddings' previous material. I am struggling to finish it, and will write to both author and publisher to let them know my feelings."
2,huge disappointment,"If it hadn't been written my the Eddings, this book would of found my fire stove pretty quickly...The good- the enemies forms and the witty humor of people- Realization of power by younger Gods- Rabbit- Longbow- pretty cheap for an average bookThe bad - too many character point of views- do we really need to know the entire backround of everyone???- the backround description makes plot super short- characters don't seem original- entire book is 1 huge battle and no real development arrises- a lot drier in comparison to other works- waste of a year of wait..."
1,Like watching paint dry,"I was not terribly impressed with the first book, but when I decided to read the second book I thought perhaps it would be worth it. Boy was I wrong. It was even more dull than the first book. The characters were flat and irritating. Not only that, but a good chunk of the book was spent going over events that happened in the FIRST book, events that weren't exciting the first time we read them. When I finally reached the end of this lengthly (and pointless) flashback, I thought ""Finally, now we might get some excitement."" Then to my horror I realized that the next huge chunk of book was written from the point of view of a character that had up to now had been exceedingly minor and that (surprise!) I didn't care about or even like. I gave up at this point and stopped reading. The bottom line is, don't bother with this book. If I could give it zero stars, I would. The truly sad thing is, I have liked David and Leigh Eddings' books in the past. What happened guys?"
2,Slow moving,"I used to be a huge fan of Eddings. This books is so slow moving, I keep skip ahead to see where the book is going to pick up steam. Most of the books are using various characters to rehash their points of view of the same event, most of the character are not that interesting.There are few good lines here and there, but it is not worth the money to purchase a Hardback.I probably will read the next book(in PAPERBACK). If you like the old Eddings. I highly recommend Jim Butcher's new novel Furies of Calderon."
3,We like the material but it warped easily,"We are getting rid of our plastic cutting boards over concerns about bacteria. I really like this very hard, recycled cardboard and that it has the qualities of wood but can be put in the dishwasher. However, it needs to be thicker and more sturdy because it warped just enough after one wash in the dishwasher that it spins like a top on the counter. Which isn't safe when handling a knife. And really for the high prices of these cutting boards I expected something more substantial."
4,very interesting. enjoyed it.,very enjoyable. Not bad going on a honeymoon with your mother. Loved it. would recommend it. are there any more movies of this nature.
4,very Laid back Set,Fatback doesn't always get the Props it deserves.this Album showcases a Smoothness&Diversity.Fatback Very Underrated Group with so Much to Offer.
2,"Disappointing, poorly written","I read the review of this book and was excited to dive into it. I found the writing to be turgid, with a flow and logic that was not conducive to easy reading. This was not the insightful exploration of ideas of historical images and social memory that the reviews led one to believe. I gave up after the first couple of chapters."
4,Other Info about Ed Townsend,"Though Townsend had only limited success as a recording artist, he had significant success as a songwriter and producer, working with the late great Marvin Gaye, among others."
5,not only FOR YOUR LOVE,"ed townsend,of course,is a legend but he`s more than just brilliant producer(dee dee warrick)and great songwriter:He is excellent singer as well.i bought this `cause i love one song on that cd but to my great pleasure there were many more that became my favorites.greatly recommended"
1,wrong item,I order BP 1582-wid with leaf cup (engraving as seen on item) I received the pull but without the engraving on the leaf. This made my client upset and lost the renovation job. I will exam all products bought and go rom there.
1,Treo 700W doesn't sync reliably with Verizon Wirelesssync,"I've setup a dozen Treo 600s and 650s for clients.One client bought a 700w and one of his employees bought a 650.I setup PC Monitor to sync their Exchange accounts with Verizon Wirelesssync, and then configured their Treos with Verizon Wirelesssync.Although the 650 user has had to reset his PC a couple of times in the past 10 weeks, he's pleased with getting/sending mail via Verizon Wirelesssync.My client with the Treo 700w however, is a completely different story. He's had problems every week, sometimes more than once. Verizon Wirelesssync tech support finally admitted that 'Push' doesn't work reliably with the 700w and had me reconfigure his handheld to poll their server for mail!That doesn't work much better."
2,treo 700W hangs up 3x per week,I bought the Treo 700w phone from the Verizon store in January 2006. This phone has major bugs in it. It hangs up about 3 times a week. I miss calls and I am only notified that I now have voice mail. Verizon has replaced this phone for me 2 times now. This is my 3rd phone and I still have the same problem with it.Push Verizon to get $$$$ off of your monthly data service fee. I did.Good LuckMichael
2,A Disappointing PDA,"The Palm Treo 700w should have made me very happy. It's too bad it has so many problems. I have had 4 devices over the past 20 months. My current phone still does not work properly. (The internet will not connect unless I restart the phone or sign on 5 or 6 times.) Verizon takes some of the blame. I live in the middle of LA and can't get reception - mind boggling. The QWERTY keyboard does make it easy type and some of the integrated features will be missed. Yet, once my new phone arrives on Monday, I will gladly pay the early termination fee to get out my contract."
2,worst phone for your money,"and here's why:-Poor signal strength: i tried 3 models and when compared to cheap Nokia phones this phone has a really bad signal strength. i've even called VZ and they verified signal strength to be good in 2 key areas for me. my parents have two cheap VZ phones and their signal is double mine.-Bulky & Large-Heavy-no USB output (need special cables to USB)-Buggy - i've had to reboot it several times as suggested by VZ Tech support. it often doesn't ring goes directly into Voicemail. sometimes it freezes.i'm a technical guy, i work for a telecom, and far from a technically ignorant retard. but i'm selling my phone faster than you can spell c-r-a-p.James"
3,Palm Treo 700w,"I generally love this phone. However there are some issues that you need to be aware of. If you plan on using a Bluetooth(BT) headset or other device to make phone calls, this is not the phone for you. Using multiple different manufactures of BT headsets this phone will hang up on the headset and turn its own BT off! This is a major problem when you are trying to drive!The software will also lock up once every few weeks, and once the reminder alarm did not go off, until I did a hard reset of the phone. Then the reminder alarm went off!"
2,"Go with the new 700p running PalmOS, it's an upgrade from the 700w","I suggest everyone looking at this phone to go with the recently introduced Treo 700p. It runs the familiar PalmOS operating system which is much easier to use than Windows (specially on the small screen), and features a higher screen resolution (320x320 in the 700p vs. 240x240 in this 700w running windows).The 700p runs PalmOS Garnet (5.4.9) sports Bluetooth v1.2, dual CDMA (800/1900Mhz) and EvDO on CDMA2000. Compatibility with Office files like Word, Excel and Powerpoint files is achieved using Documents-to-GO bundled software.The 700p supports MultiMediaCard, SD & SDIO memory cards, up to two gigabytes. Plus, the 700p&#65533;s digital camera sports 1280x1024 res. and does video recording 352 x 288. It also has automatic ligth balance.In short: avoid this 700w that gives you lower resolution and a more cumbersome OS and go with the Treo 700p running Palm OS, just released in mid-May 2006."
1,Treo 700 wx sucks,"This boat anchor has critical memory error problems that are not resolvable by local Verizon technicians. It dumps files, locks up necessitating soft rebooting, and has one redeeming feature-it is heavy enough to provide an aerobic workout if you carry it throughout your day. Buyer beware!"
1,Think twice about using Amazon,"It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon. Suffice to say if you have ANY problems with your order or service - count on it being YOUR problem and NOT Amazon's. There is no accountability for any problems you may have, but if you can accept that, the Treo 700w is a nice phone (with some limitations as described by the more tech savvy) - however, in my opinion NO PHONE is worth the amount of time and aggravation I have spent dealing with [...]. Go directly to the wireless provider and ditch the middle man.com."
1,THIS THING SUCKS!!!,"In March of this year I hated my Verizon 650 and the constant resetting so much that I decided to spend the $550 on the 700w.BIG MISTAKE.This thing sucked more then the 650. After a month I was WISHING I had my 650 back. Now, I've switched to Cingular [thank God] and a Blackberry 8700c and love it."
1,Phone? PDA? Unfortunately it does neither very well...,"What a disappointment this phone has been. I've been using it for heavy business use (4,000 minutes a month and unlimited data plan - averaging 1,500-3,000 MB of data transfers a month). I switched to Verizon after 12+ years with AT&T;/Cingular because of this phone and the EVDO network. Now I am stuck with a $500 paperweight and a $175 cancellation fee to go back to Cingular.The good:The EVDO network and a small piece of software called ""PDAnet"" which lets you use the Treo as a broadband modem for your laptop or PDA.The Verizon wireless sync made it pretty easy to set up my own ""push server"" without hassling with my internal IT group, but it does need to be rebooted every week or so or it will simply stop forwarding emails.The Bad (highlights only):Where should I start - there is so much BAD about this phone... The single biggest problem is the way it manag"
2,P.O.S.,"It's the little annoyances that make me rate it so low. Yes it is full of features, but the constant resetting, the constant one-thing-after-another, has driven me to hate this phone. I bought my 700w Feb 05 when it was $500. I like the smart phone idea, very useful, but with all the bugs mentioned in the other reviews... I would not recommend it. I'm looking for another smart phone."
1,Nothing is working but the calendar and phonebook,Looking forward to this 700w for quite sometimes. Sad thing is Verizon wants too much money out of your pocket and make nothing working on the unit for you. You have EVDO services and cannot use it as a bluetooth modem for your laptop internet access. You go buy the wifi card that doesn't work with any internet voip applicaiton or corporate PEAP-GTC network because it's asking for a personal certicate (no..root certificate wont work). You claim the rebate too fast. So you are stuck with the phone. What is good? My son likes the bubble pop game I guess that's the good part of it....and i use it to check the date and time. Man...what a time waste and a shame to have a product made with so many limitation. I think RIMM will take care of the corporate messaging world easily.
1,Treo 700w verizon sucks,"Well, here is the deal. We purchased 20 treos last december. they worked great for about 2 months, then the real treo came out. We have to take the battery out everyday on every treo 700w. it freezes constantly, internet fails, calls dropped with full signal strenght. slowness and sometimes up to 30 secs of a delay when you press a button. so many more i just want to get rid of this phone so fast, but the 2 year contract does not allow me to as verizon does not seem to fix the issue.PS we also bought 1 cingular 750w and it sucks more. it freezes and the speakers dont work and we also need to take the battery out. Soon moving to blackberry"
1,Do not trust this!,"I never review, but I just have to say that the information from this book is outdated and misinterpreted. The doctors referenced here were followed up with after the book's publishing, and they said they were misquoted, and the studies misunderstood. Adelle's writings were the cause of death for many children, given large amounts of potassium chloride and vitamin A, both toxic in large quantities. Please, for the sake of true health, don't follow this book or its teachings!!"
1,Author was a quack,"Stop. Please see the medical review of this book at http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/davis.html . People have died relying on parts. It is not ""super research""."
2,Not Appropriate for Younger Girls,"I bought this for my 11 year old sister because looking at the title ""The Period Book"" I thought it would be what I was looking for to explain puberty. Then I get the book and am flipping through it and come to page 13 with a sketch of a nude girl with a line pointing to her genitals and a sketch of a nude boy with a line pointing to his genitals. I wasn't aware that boys got periods. Page 16 has a diagram of a female's genitals with the different parts labelled and the next page has the lovely sentence, ""The clitoris is responsible for many of the pleasurable feelings women experience when they have sex"". Like I said, I've only flipped through the book, not read it from cover to cover, but have read enough to know this book isn't appropriate for an 11 year old."
2,Wow! Too Much!,"My mom bought this book for me when I turned 12, and we looked through it together. Wow, I could not believe what I had read! It was way too innapropriate for pre-teens. I would reccomend ""The Care and Keeping of You"". By American Girl."
5,"Practical, straightforward information made interesting.","This is a great follow-up book to ""The Care and Keeping of You"" (in the American Girl series). This book touches on all of the same subjects, such as hygene, periods, puberty, etc., but goes a little more in depth. While it does not address sex directly, it does address the topic where necessary and in a scientific, practical way. It is a good ""bridge"" book for you and your daughter. This book will help your daughter understand herself before she gets into the more adult topics of sex and romantic love."
1,Took too long to arrive,The book was in fair condition but took over a month to arrive. The only notification I received was two weeks after I purchased it. They knew before hand that delays were occurring due to it being outside the country and Homeland Security laws. They should have disclosed at time of ordering.
1,Not for pre-teens or younger,"I picked this book up, looking for something to facilitate the ""big talk"" with my 9 year old daughter. She knew the very basics, but nothing physiological. I came across startlingly inappropriate information for the suggested age range of this book. It was just too much info for children.I was looking for a description of how menstruation work, not that you can get pregnant from sperm on a finger! How do you work that into a conversation with a 9 year old who isn't old enough to stay home alone, let alone start thinking about sex or boys in that light yet? This book may work for some families, but I chose not to give it to my daughter. Not now and not when she is older."
5,GREAT!,"i loved the book, my mom handed this to me one day and it really helped me talk with her about those kinds of things. i highly reccomend it"
4,Great Details,This book is full of great details regarding what you need to know about getting your period. I enjoy reading it with my 9 yr old daughter.
5,Top Notch first Novel,This book is one of the best first novels I have had the pleasure of reading. It is well written and intertwines action and a whole new approach to interstellar travel and the lives of the families involved along with the always dreaded possibility of invasion from the stars and what would the response be from us...... I hope that a sequel will follow as I could not put this book down..... Thanks John!!!
5,a rare treasure,"every once in a while, a book pops up that really succeeds in almost every way imaginable...that is, capturing the imagination, feeling empathy with/for the characters and then simply getting so involved with the story that nothing else exists except the written word...The Officers'Ward is one of these jewels...the lovely thing about it is that it may be read in one sitting and even though the story is quite tragic, there is a certain slant of optimism that keeps the story alive. a simple, elegant story...i highly recommend."
5,My all time favourite book,"The Officer's ward. Moved me like no other book has ever moved me before.It is one of those books, that once you start reading it you can not put it down. I am a reader that tends to have a few books running at once and it can take me weeks to finish them. This book I read in two days.The strength of human spirit shines in this book.If you only read one book in your life this is the book to read. The regretful thing is, that after this book all other books pale into insignificance."
3,Collects Some Dust,Easy to install. Collects about 60% of the sawdust generated from the table saw which helps a lot...less for the shop vac to pickup.
2,"Nice try, but I'll pass","I have a Craftsman ""Limited Edition"" saw (they only made 50 million units) which like the inexpensive Delta saws have plenty of gaps between the saw top and the saw body, that may need plugging so that a bag like this will work better. You'll also have to plug the slots made for the blade tilt. If you do all that, you may expose the saw to more dust and heat may build up. You can't hook up a Slopvac or dust collector to the DC001 so as to suck up dust and pull in cooler air to reduce heat buildup. I solved this issue by plugging all the vents and gaps and then building a box which fits snugly under the saw--the box has a hole that will accommodate tubing from my Slopvac (or a dust collector when I get one). Under these conditions, I get much less dust scattered around. you can make one cheaply from 1/2"" plywood because you have a table saw!"
1,Ed,"The ad states it will fit all Delta contactors saws, which is not true.I own a Delta Platinum Edition 10"" Contractor's Saw and it does not fit any of what Dleta calls Contactor Saw. It will fit their Table and Bench Saws with stands.The ad states ""with open stand"" and that is true...."
3,"This works OK, but only with certain table saws","This is a good solution for people who don't want to spend upwards of $1,000 for a dust collection system. Be aware that this will not fit the popular Dewalt 744 saw or stand without a lot of modification. I doubt that it would fit the Bosch table saw either."
5,Works as advertised,"Easy to install out of the box. Had no problems with the snaps, as per other reviews. Works as advertised."
3,JDS Company 10-16 1000/1600 CFM Air-Tech 2000 Air Filtration System,"Top of shipping container had been removed exposing the unit & poorly taped back on with cellophane packing tape, ultimatly left flopping in the wind. One large dent in the side of the unit, corners of the unit were bent & rivet was sheered off(apparently dropped) such that the filters couldn't be removed.Several large scratches that gouged deep into the sheet metal.I spent over an hour straightening & reforming corners to make the thing operational!Quality of the unit itself was acceptable, but I wouldn't pay suggested retail for it. Shipping was free & I can see why!!Probably the last big ticket item I will purchase from mail order!Save yourself some grief! buy locally!!"
1,A clear Jefferson Airplane ripoff,"The title does NOT suggest homage to a painter named James K. Baxter: rather it is a clear misappropriation of the brilliant Jefferson Airplane album of the same name.I know nothing of this book. I do strongly suggest, though, that people make the effort to find the album. Nothing more beautifully and poignantly evokes the lyricism of the 60s -- or exposes as powerfully the brooding intelligence of the band that was the absolute lodestar for the psychedlic movement in America."
1,Cover says it all,A guide about the catalan capital that has a picture of a woman dressed in an andalusian (southern Spain) typical dress on its cover is like a guide of Edinburgh with a pint of Guiness on its cover. Only suitable for anglosaxon tourists with a very low cultural profile.
5,The BEST single DVD for hand techniques,"For most drummers, it begins with the hands. This DVD is packed with excellent technical details about how to go from the very beginnings, to stick fluency. These details are not only shown, but explained precisely and concisely. You also get to seem them demonstrated by a master. If I could recommend only one instructional DVD (and there are many excellent choices), this would be the one. I consider it a must have for any beginning drummer, regardless of playing style. I rate very few products with 5 stars, but this one clearly earned it."

If you are advanced or just a beginner or if you want to get this as a gift for someone you know and you are not sure which to get. Make it this one!"
5,They are great space savers,"These fold away for storage easily but mine are constantly in use. I like to presort my laundry and just throw it into the wash whenever I feel like washing so I have like 3 of these and 3 of the smaller ones.The fact that they are perfectly square lets them sit side by side neatly taking up as little space as possible. The handles make it easy to carry. They are pretty sturdy and after 2 years of use, they've held their shape. One I use specifically for jeans and I have a lot of those so it fills up until its bulging (pretty heavy) and even that one hasn't lost its shape. I just wish they came in different colors other than brown."
5,Sturdy hamper,"I ordered two of these hampers, one for each of my kid's rooms. I love how sturdy these hampers are. While they are a little heavier than the mesh ones I had been using, the construction on these will go the distance. I like that the inside of the hamper is water-resistant. (It might be considered waterproof, but I don't remember for sure and I don't want to give false information.) I have put used towels in it, and I am not concerned about mold or mildew. Of course, I live in the high desert, so those two things are not normally present here. The hamper itself holds one load of laundry for my high-capacity front load washing machine. I do have the carry the full laundry basket downstairs and through the house, but it is not too cumbersome. And it is definitely light enough for my 4 year old to carry it back upstairs. I would recommend this hamper to anyone with kids or if he/she was looking for a good hamper. I even like the colors."
5,Just the thing for big laundry loads,"Holds a whole big comforter and sheets. Light years better than the flimsy pop ups I'd been using. Would be nice in other colors, but it's neutral. Excellent product."
1,Please don't buy this.,"I purchase three of Rubbermaid 4D06 Configurations 23-Inch Fold-able Laundry Hampers at the end of June, 2010. And in early September, one of them has the bottom stitching broken. We do laundry once a week and the basic moves are just lift up, hold it to the laundry room, put down, and after laundry, lift up, hold it back to bathroom, put down. I cannot believe the quality is so bad that it can't even last three months. I heard the hampers from IKEA are better and cheaper."
5,Best hamper ever,"After years of plastic hampers that each eventually broke, I decided to try a cloth hamper. I bought three of these and I love them! They are a great size (my husband and I each have our own, and we have one for towels, and it takes a couple of weeks to fill each of them), and easy to carry with the handles on the sides. Because they are square, they fit very well in the room without taking up space too. I also like that the bottom is removable so they can be folded up and put away if needed. I will likely buy another for the laundry room and kitchen next."
5,a good buy- sturdy and lightweight,"i'm a product designer. i wanted something sturdy, lightweight, foldable, and not ugly. my color preference was browns and blues. i didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that gets dragged down to the basement on a regular basis. i bought two of these and i'm quite happy with them. i've had them for about a month and so far, no issues."
4,"Very functional, good design","I just leave this in the closet and empty clothes into a laundry basket for transport to the basement. Lightweight, small footprint, easy to pull in and out of narrow closet as long as there is enough clearance between the top and the hanging clothes. Compact and sturdy."
5,4 years and counting!,I purchased 3 of these hampers on sale over 4 years ago and they're still in use today. They get quite the workout too as my family goes through a LOT of laundry. Very happy with them and they're quality. I'll buy them again (if they ever die!).
5,A Year and a Half Later: Great,"I bought two of these a year and half ago (one for lights, the other darks for $17.56 each) and they are still going strong. Tall and slender for my space, it fits a great amount of clothing. Check the size for your use and do not get them wet as one reviewer mentioned it doesn't go back to it's original form. I recommend this to anyone."
5,As expected,"Not much to say. It's a hamper. It doesn't look horrible, holds plenty of clothes, so it pretty much meets my expectations. Good buy."
5,Sturdy and large capacity,"The hamper is perfect! It has a large capacity, nylon interior (which is great because its washable), and is a great design. It folds away when not in use and doesn't take up much space. Very happy with my purchase!"
4,Nice Look,We ordered this for our bedroom bathroom and the neutral color works for any room. It fits well in the corner and is very tough.
5,"Best hamper ever, get a few!","I figured this was cheesy because it was rubbermaid, but it doesn't look half bad. Essentially it feels like a cardboard box, in that it folds out very easily, but it's sturdier than you would think. The fabric looks nice and it feels sturdy. It carried just enough laundry to carry before you feel overwhelmed by weight (and handles are sturdy). I really don't see a point to a giant hamper that you can't even lift. I've bought 2 of these, and want to buy 2-3 more (though out of stock at the moment). Finally my hamper searching is over."
4,laundry hamper,"I ordered to organize my laundry room. It works wonderfully to help a every family sort laundry loads. I ironed on the words ""colors, white, linens"". It has worked out great."
3,The handles are not so good if you have to go a distance,I live in NYC and the laundromat is about 5 blocks away. The handles are tough on your hands if you go that distance. I used to have a cheap mesh one with some give in the handles that was easier to take.My usage is probably different from most so take this as you like.
2,Looks nice but difficult to use,"I'm surprised by the positive reviews of this hamper. Sure, it looks nice and seems fairly durable. But it takes two hands to carry and the edges of the hand-holds are sharp, making them press deeply into your palms with heavy loads. This is a stay-put hamper that blends into a laundry room. It is not one to be carried from your apartment or dorm. This hamper is a total sacrifice of function for form."
3,It's kind of heavy,"When I receive this item I was surprised because the box it really huge and heavy. After I open the box, I found that it has a good quality but the weight is too heavy. I can't expect how heavy it would be after I put my dirty clothes collection into it and take it to the laundry room."
3,no bad,The appearance is nice but for some reason it is very difficult to clean and shows a lot of smudges. I think that they should have made it a different color. it is very sturdy though and holds a lot of clothes.
3,Suggestion:,"This product looks perfect - except the color! Pretty, but would like a selection of darker colors, like deep chocolate brown, black, navy, etc., that won't show soil as easily."
4,"A bit heavy, but very sturdy","This hamper is a little heavy, but other than that it is great. It is really sturdy, which we like since it is replacing our old hampers which are falling apart from carrying them full of laundry. The handles make it easy to carry to and from the laundry room in the basement.If you're looking for a long lasting hamper, this one is awesome!"
5,Great Purchase,"I purchased this to hold towels in my laundry room. Previously I used the pop-up baskets, but with a family of five who uses a lot of towels in one day, I needed something that wouldn't fall over due to the weight of the towels. This works perfectly, and I liked it so much I ordered another one."
5,Great hampers,Haven't had these very long but I would say for the price they seem to be quite durable and easy to carry. I've purchased two and will be getting two more.
2,Overall OK - One was missing the bottom inset,"Hamper functions well, it is nicely collapsible, and not too big (perfect for using during a party, for guests to drop their small trash in). However, out of the two, one was missing a critical inset, that which creates a sturdy bottom. I will need to return - so much hassle for a critical part."
1,Poor quality; difficult to clean,"I bought 3 and I wish I hadn't. Without getting wet or moist directly, the outside got very moldy. Difficult to clean."
3,They Work,"I bought 4 of these about 6 months ago. They are somewhat sturdy (still using them today), but really require two hands to carry, or you will end up creating a permament crease in them. I give them 3 stars because of the ""crease"" factor, and the fact that I can't really get that excited about a laundry holding product!"
3,"Good Price, Decent Mixed Quality, Not Very Portable","Quality - I expected better quality. It has sloppy stitching which makes it looks cheap if you look close. From the distance is looks good.Function - It's not portable! Please don't buy if you plan on lugging it somewhere, it's much better permanently placed in your laundry room. The hamper is very rigid. So if you have to move it, you end up having to do a odd looking shuffle, as you carry around what is basically a stiff box.Price - It seems to be priced well for it's quality, despite the sloppy stitches I noted above."
4,Looks Nice & Gets the Job Done,"I purchased two of these to keep in my laundry room. I wish that they were a little taller, but otherwise I really like them. The inside lining is bluer than I thought it would be, but it has a nice look to it, and I love that that inside material can be cleaned out. This would also work well in a closet or a bedroom because of the neutral clean and neat look to it."
5,does its job,"im loving this. Truly the right size, not too big, not too small. Could be sturdier but considering what its made of, and that its fold-able, and for the very good price, cant complain."
5,Best hamper ever!,"After too many years of my cat crushing those awful mesh hampers, I decided to give this hamper a try. Arrived in less than a week. It's fantastic! Very sturdy, and bigger than I expected. Best of all -- the cat can't kill it!"
4,nice price and space saver,i got this for 11.99 on Friday sale . It fit the closet perfectly and saves a lot of space . can fold if not needed . a great product for laundry storage and organization .
5,Hide Your Dirty Laundy,"I love these hampers -- they're attractive, don't take much floor space, have handles that make carrying them a breeze, and they even fold up for travel. The inside is vinyl so you can easily wipe it clean. LOVE 'EM."
4,Sturdy and functional,I've had these for a few weeks now and find them to fit the bill. I like that they are taller than laundry baskets taking up a little less bedroom real estate. Seem to be well made.
4,"Easy, Simple, Affordable","It's a little smaller than I had pictured it to be, but fits well in the bathroom. Sturdy setup and really nice to get two or three and fold them up (very easy to fold to put away or setup). Would definitely recommend for something simple.Comes with an insert for the base that helps increase sturdiness."
4,Very acceptable,"I'm happy with this hamper. It's a good price, the size is nice, it's pretty easy to carry, and the liner is a nice touch. However, my outer canvas came with a few colored imperfections on it, and the canvas almost immediately started to pull away form the inside of one of the handles. This is not a huge deal, as it is a hamper, and I just covered it with a piece of tape (on the inside), but I don't think I would purchase this one again. I like most things about it, and it fits nicely into the closet."
3,"Adequate, But Flimsy","You can't really expect a collapsible hamper at this price to be too sturdy, but it'd be nice. This one is fine, but didn't really exceed my expectations. I guess it does what it's supposed to - it stays in one spot while holding clothes, but when it's almost full it starts to bend and bow on the sides and doesn't return to it's original shape.All-in-all, not a bad purchase for the money. If you're looking for something cheap that does the job adequately, but not greatly, this is for you. I'll be keeping mine...for now."
4,Homerun,"I buy a great many books such as this one and am often rather disappointed in the books. Not so in this case, it's a winner and very interesting.It's always hard to translate your ideas for others into a home for yourself and so it's nice to see how the designers do just that.I think most would find this an interesting book from that prespective."
2,Wildly n-integrated Story,"I was riveted with the stories Ms. Winstead's father told, and her trips South. For that alone, the book is worth something, also for some insights into isolation of Northern suburban living, something I could relate to, growing up in similar protected surroundings.But the story all became confusing and I became as confused as she was, about all of the issues and it all turned into a muddle. I did not see the story lines integrated well; the jumps between her personal crises, the family stories and the stories of the murders in Neshoba County all remained separate and jarring, - not fully integrated at all. She has a lot to say about these things, but she is not saying them well, giving each half the treatment they deserve. Maybe this should really be 2 or 3 books."
1,A waste of my precious time,"I chose to read this book because I thought that Ms. Winstead was going to write about the slayings of the Civil Rights Workers (Andrew Goodman, James Earl Chaney, and Michael Henry Schwerner). She did, but a little less than 1/3 of her book was actually about their slayings and how her great uncle was involved with the slayings.I was really very disappointed. She talked mostly about her racist family that lived in the state of Mississippi and the 'N' word was used way too much.If you haven't purchased this book yet, good..if you did...oh well!!!Hint (If this book was so good, then why are so many people selling theirs?)...Thank You."
2,Not as good as the others,"Definately an early attempt at the Putt-Putt series. Not as good as the later games, but o.k. if you are an avid fan."
4,Review on Putt-Putt goes to the moon,"According to my 5-year old kid, game is easy, and the graphics is a little bit poor (it's only VGA); as compared to ""travel through time""."
1,Not Worth It!,"My son (3) loves the other PuttPutt games, but he didn't like this one because of the poor graphics and the fact that it has ""monsters"". He was afraid of it."
2,poor quality,My 3 yr old grand sone likes it but I have to set up the video resolution before it will work. All of these games seem to be written by different people and none are very professional.
3,"INTENDED FOR ""THE ONION"" AUDIENCE","If you love ""The Onion"" newspaper, you will probably like this movie. If you are a fan and male, you will love this movie. It is definitely geared toward their fan base and others might not appreciate the satire. It scares me that some material might be less satire and more serious but that is somewhat the point.The movie contains a whole bunch of skits that loosely connect to the main story: an established Onion news anchor gets angry over the crass commercialism of the parent company.I will provide sample skits for your review: a Catholic Irish teenager thinks it's cool to act like a gangsta rapper and while hanging out with friends, he is arrested since a black man was identified as the perpetrator of a nearby crime; and Steven Seagal mocks himself as the star of a new movie entitled, C*ck Fighter (something along those lines) where he punches everyone in the sack. It is not exactlyRobot Chicken, Season 1but it is Adult Swim material."
2,Hit or Miss?,"As a long time subsciber of The Onion Newspaper I was a little dissappointed. Although the paper can have hit or miss stories you have the option of bailing a few sentences in and turning the page. With the video you seemed to be held captive, you want to fast forward through a bad skit but you hope it may become funny any second now. Some of the skits were like a bad car accident, you know you shouldn't look....but you still do."
3,There Are Better Onions,"After occasionally reading an Onion newspaper, I had some idea what I was getting into here. However, I felt that much of the film didn't live up to the cutting-edge satire of the newspaper. The movie consists of a series of comedy sketches bound together by the Onion's lack of reverence for anything and a tepid plot line.Some of the segments were very funny. I thought Sarah McElligott was quite vibrant as Melissa Cherry, a Britney Spears clone. The skit about the ""reformed"" bank robber was great. Steven Seagal's martial arts spoof had its moments. But many of the routines fell flat, and some were so tasteless that they were actually...tasteless.The core of the Onion--take no prisoners, nothing is sacred--was there. But as the layers were peeled off, a lot didn't smell like an Onion."
3,Rent first,This movie has some funny parts but it is completely not worth buying. i would suggest to anyone to rent it or borrow it but dont waste your money buying it. I know my family watched it and laughed but it hasnt been seen again. Its a movie that doesnt hold your attention through the entire film but most parts are funny.
3,funny skits...short on plot,"There are some very funny skits and satire in the Onion Movie. The Britney Spears spoof is one of the funnier things I've seen in a long time. The film is as politically incorrect as they come, and each individual skit stands on its own. However, throwing it all together into a movie doesn't quite work. The plot was weak, and the conclusion was goofy. This would've been much better as a collection of individual skits, much like SNL."
1,Horrendous.,"This movie is absolutely terrible. Stick to The Onion's print media and website, and avoid the film. I wish I had."
1,onion movie,this movie was nothing like i thought it was going to be. this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life so far. i expected it to make fun of the news not be the news. i would only recommend this movie for someone i didn't like & i hope nobody makes the same mistake i did by buying this movie. it sucks.
1,Just...awful,"The previous reviewer said this was for fans of Amazon Women on the Moon and The Kentucky Fried Movie. I disagree. This is more for fans of Date Movie and Spy Hard--you know, people who are incapable of seeing jokes get in the cab up the street and drive right up to them.I love The Onion, but this production was terrible. Whereas Amazon Women on the Moon spawned Arsenio's famous line, ""Look, the b*tch don't live here, man!"", and The Kentucky Fried movie famously featured Henry Gibson telling us that ""Death took more lives in America last year than any other cause,"" there are no such memorable moments in this movie. None. Most of the setups were unfunny from the word go, and while other skits looked promising, they went on far, far too long.Do not waste your money. Every single video on The Onion's website is funnier than anything you will find here."
4,Onion Movie-Kentucky Fried Movie for the new millenium,"This movie is really really funny. It's not ""the greatest thing ever made"" but it's still pretty damned hilarious. It's a great parody. I rented it hoping it was exactly what it was: a variety of parodies with a plot mixed in. No, it's not the paper.........it's a movie based on the Onion style of viewing the world. If you have ever seen Kentucky Fried movie this will seem like an updated companion piece. You really need to go into watching this movie with these things in mind. It's just a good ride. The movie isn't high-brow humour that's meant to be the best in the world but you'll get a chuckle out of it. I've been waiting for this for a while since I saw a preview on another DVD I rented. I know all my friends who are ZAZ (Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker) fans will love this and I am going to buy it so we can all watch it."
2,Area Man Disappointed,"As a more thorough review has already been posted here, I'll keep it brief when I say that I was fully disappointed by this film. I'm a huge fan of the Onion newspaper and the Onion online, especially when I rushed out to rent this movie the first day it was available (good thing I didn't buy it). The trailer that has been circulating the internet for some time is hilarious, but captures the only good scenes from the entire feature. Most segments are long, redundant, and unfunny, and although they are tied together in the end, the movie is missing the charm that I have come to expect from the Onion's caliber of work. Overall, rent this DVD if you have to, but it's something that should remain on the shelves."
3,90 minute skit show disguised as a movie,"This movie is more like a 90 minute skit show tied together with the premise of a veteran newsman's ethics against his sellout coorporate company. It all builds and connects nicely at the end, even if it doesn't durring the movie itself. Its satire about news, music videos, and commercials. Because these are sketches / skits, its a mixed bag. Mostly involving either stereotypes, swerves or uncomfortable moments. Such as the r*pe mystery party or the handicap hockey player. Stereotypes like... well... use your imagination and typical Onion swerves like having a news story about a man's missing sock instead of the explosion outside. This is more a movie to watch with your friends and wonder huh? Then laugh amongst yourselves AT the movie than with it."
3,Did not translate from the written version,"America's Finest News Source makes for fantasatic entertaining print. Unfortunately, it didn't translate too well for the movie. There was some humor (a parody of Brittney Sprears and Steve Seagal doing a self-parody) but overall it didn't translate well to the screen. The subversive dark humor was there, but perhaps a little too much Leslie Nielsenesque humor with it.The movie was 80 minutes long, and that was at least 20 minutes too much."
1,This onion left a bad taste in my mouth,"Good try, but this one totally misses the mark. The humor is offensive...not funny. The acting is horrendous. I wouldn't recommend this to any of my family members or friends. They'd think I was warped...no sense of humor...just warped. I trashed it. This onion definitely left a bad taste in my mouth."
5,Area Man Anticipates Film Shelved for Five Years,This is bound to be one of the best movies ever that has sat languishing on a shelf for many years before foisted on an unsuspecting public. Bring it on...finally!
3,"Funny, but not hilarious","If you like stupid humor, then this is your kind of movie. This movie I would watch every once in a while. It's not the kind that I'd watch over and over again though."
4,Raw onion! Not for kids...,"Much the same type of thing one expects from the onion. Crude, stereotypical and offensive, It is all I had hoped it would be! Caution, not for kids and bring a sense of humor because if it were not HUMOR, it would be very offensive. But it is humor, so ENJOY!!!"
3,Christmas gift,The service was great. I received the DVD very quickly and in plenty of time for Christmas
3,Disappointed,"Being familiar with the Onion I expected better. The movie did try to create connections between its pieces but I would have liked to have seen something more like a continuous news product rather than the cutaways between Norm and the management. Some parts WERE hilarious, such as the Jumping Johnny bits and the depiction of the terrorists but as a whole it just didn't come off that well."
1,I wish I could give it zero stars,"Let me preface this by saying that I normally enjoy the onion's website. With that said, this movie is horrible. 80 minutes of bad jokes and to make matters worse they recycle their own bad jokes. I wasn't expecting a whole lot when I saw this movie went straight to video but even with my low expectations I was very disappointed.The onion should be ashamed of this project."
1,Unbearable,"I have been an adoring fan of The Onion newspaper, and I have a high tolerance, indeed predilection for awful movies. However, I can say with no metaphor or exaggeration that I found this movie nausea-inducing! Thank goodness my friends and I consumed copious amounts of weed while watching it or my unsoothed stomach may have attempted emptying itself in a misguided attempt to rid my body of its influence.Its fundamental problem is a nasty case of Self-Satirizing Syndrome. The attempts to parody American culture and the news industry completely backfire, coming off as a childish imitation of biting satire (isn't that what all the cool kids are doing? What about brain lesions, is that how all the cool kids are getting injured now?). The intelligence level of this movie tragically does not rise above its subject matter. There are a few good performances here (Len Cariou, Mousie Garner), and a handful of legitimately funny sketches, but overall I say NOT WORTH IT."
2,The best parts of the movie can be seen in the trailers,"I was looking forward to seeing this because I really enjoyed the first season of the Onion News Network TV show and was disappointed. The trailer was funny, and I was expecting it to be as good as the show was, but it failed in that respect.If you've seen the show, lower your expectations. It's worth renting if you like any of their other stuff, but nothing more."
4,The Onion Movie,"Very funny. At times I cringed at certain segments I have to admit. But my family always have a ball while watching this. It's very perverted at times, but is worth owning because it's not your usual comedy. I would not recommend this to parents with little children obviously, but if everybody is mature and like this type of comedy it's worth it."
3,Version perfectamente atendible.,"Esta es una version muy economica y bastante aceptable de la bella partitura rossiniana. Se sirve con el final feliz. La baza de la grabación es el Tancredi de EWA PODLES, una auténtica creación, por sus extraordinarios medios, coloratura y sensibilidad a la hora de transmitir. Delicada, agudísima y afinadísima la Amenaide de SUMI JO, aunque quizá un ligero vibratto afee su prestacion algunas veces. El tenor STANFORD OLSEN (Argirio) posee una voz no especialmente bella y la técnica no pasa de correcta, convirtiendose, con mucho, en el mas flojo del equipo. Cumplen con bastante solvencia PIETRO SPAGNOLI, ANNA MARIA DI MICCO (interesantisima Isaura) y LUCRETIA LENDI en sus respectivos roles secundarios.Muy bien la dirección de ALBERTO ZEDDA, y correctos, sin más la orquesta y el coro. El sonido es bastante bueno.Version economica, para disfrutar del arte impagable de la Podles, una protagonista bastante bien secundada en la mayoria de los casos."
4,"charming performance, great value for the price","I enjoyed this performance; it seemed sweet and charming, with almost a chamber feeling to it. The singing was fine, though I was not as blown away by Podles as some other online reviewers were. She has an interesting, dark voice, but some breath control problems and she won't make me forget Horne, Berganza, or Bartoli any time soon. Sumi Jo is okay, though a lightweight (as she was when I heard her as Lucia at the Met a few years ago). Still, this is youthful Rossini and the album had a youthful feel to it; I found myself humming along. The conducting was controlled, though I would have liked a little more drive and excitement. On the whole, a really good value for a really good price. I'll listen to it many times and give it a permanent place in my Rossini collection. Now--does anyone know where I can get the Sutherland/Horne Semiramide or the Carreras/von Stade Otello?"
5,GR8 way to donate money toward the U.S. 9-11 tragedy victims,"This CD single, Champion, also found on the Unwind CD, is a beautiful song! I bought many of these single CD's to give to friends and family, not only because the song is awesome and meaningful, ... all proceeds go to the NY tragedy victims. What a great way to do your part in support for all of the tragic-stricken victims.Once you listen to Champion, you will most likely get Oleander's latest album, Unwind, unless you already have it. This group is great in concert, in both big and small venues. Once you see them, you will keep going back."
2,Pretty awful...with too few highlights,"I love 2 Banks of 4. Maybe that made the disappointment with this album all the stronger. It's simply awful. 2 Banks of 4 have produced some masterpieces in Gallagher's time since Galliano, and this is a blight on that record. There are some saving graces: Street Lullaby [Herbert Remix], Skylines Over Rooftops [Noggi's Mix] and There de la Tete [Anjali Remix], Movin. Overall, far too few for an 11 track album. Please avoid."
2,Didn't add anything new to my collection,"I'll start off by saying I have both the original Squeeze and and Squeeze Stronger and use both regularly. This DVD just didn't work enough of my problem areas (butt, hips, and inner thighs). It was heavy on quad work-lots of reverse lunges which lasted for almost half the workout. My quads tend to build up easily so I really didn't care for this. Also, this is an exercise I can get from just about any workout for the lower body. The exercises that utilize the chair for balance just felt awkward. It felt like they were barre exercises trying to be reworked using a chair and it just wasn't working for me."
3,"Love Tracy Effinger, but not this workout.","I love Squeeze and Squeeze Stronger and recommend them emphatically, but found this workout odd. It is extremely heavy on hip flexor stress and quad work and has very little benefit (in my opinion) for the base of the glutes or hamstrings. Instead it focuses on the outside hip in targeted exercises, which is fine to do, but unnecessary since there are several minutes of standing leg work (standing on one leg, to be specific). I'm a barre teacher and would never teach a class like this. Might work for some, however, and I really do enjoy Tracy Effinger. She's got a great screen presence and seems really genuine--warm, challenging, and encouraging at the same time."
5,Great value,"After being very disappointed with the poor quality of the Excel tool chest I received and returned, I ordered the Waterloo PMX2606BU chest. Waterloo is a name I am familiar with, and they are known for their quality products. I was not disappointed. This is a well made product, just as my 30 year old Waterloo box was way back then. The finish is first class and the construction is flawless. And, I didn't find ""Made in China"" anywhere on the box or packaging. Looking forward to 30 years of use from this box."
5,Sunblock,I like this product better than the usual sunblocks. It dries to a powder finish & looks less greasy on my face. It also does not make my face break out.
5,BEAUTIFULLY PHOTOGRAPHED LOOK AT THE WORLD THROUGHT SNIPPETS OF THE LAST 30 YEARS OF NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SPECIALS. IC,"This is a 95 minute romp thru 30 years of SPECIALS (a little piece of each program) with very interesting insight into the work of the photographers and the worlds they enter to produce the beauty, grace and engaging forces that NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC has produced since 1965. GORGEOUS. ALARMING. PENETRATING. AWESOME. HEARTFELT. A FEAST FOR THE EYES. A GLORIOUS view into the natural world and our part in it."
1,Not viewable,This is the first time I am trying Unbox Video. It did not work. The Video Player kept crashing. I have a Pentium M Machine with 1 GB and running Windows XP Media Center Edition with SP2. Very dissapointing.
5,"Nature as it should be presented, in the natural form right up to the bloody death of food","When I was in high school, watching National Geographic specials on television was a requirement in science classes. At times, we were shown the older ones on film. This tape is a brief synopsis of many of the specials, starting out with a title image and then showing a few minutes of the original.This is nature programming at its most raw and best. In general, the specials are not for children, the one depicting lions shows them taking down, killing and consuming their prey. However, they are as educational as film can ever be because after a certain age, nature should not be sugar-coated. It must be presented in the natural form, complete with the birth, growls, snarls and the blood of a violent death."
3,Good but dated,This is pleasant National Geographic video. It covers a lot without going into any real detail. It is worth viewing but already seems a little old fashioned.
5,Third Day - The #1 Best Christian Band,I had to have this Third Day CD to add to my collection. I've seen them in concert and love listening to all of their songs. This album is awesome!
5,Can't beat this if you're a 3rd Day fan or not one yet,"I have all their old CDs so there was no epiphany for me on hearding this new collection, but it's a solid assortment of past hits that can't be faulted.The video DVD alone is worth the purchase price for the 2-disk set. Seeing the band evolve from their jumpy-punk early videos to GMA spots then on to smooth recent stuff is priceless! Cry out to Jesus still makes me cry.3 thumbs up!"
5,ACCESSORY,"Quite happy, especially with the extended length of hose ~ WOULD have like MORE ATTACHMENTS ! Otherwise happy with item !"
4,A good book if you love Baja,"This book was quite enjoyable for anyone who has ever (or thought about it) kayaked in Baja. The book has a nice selection of photos and maps of the Baja region and should certainly be included in your ""Baja library.""The same topic was covered previously in Jonathan Waterman's ""Kayaking the Vermillion Sea."" The difference between the two is the obvious (solo vs having a partner), but also extends beyond that--Waterman provided a closer introspective view of his experience, while Darack is more matter-of-fact about his experiences. In a way, Darack underemphasizes the dangerousness of the Sea of Cortez.I certainly recommend reading this book."
4,"If you enjoyed the 1st part, you'll probably like this one.","In the future, China detains the leadership of the world; so they continue trying to discover the secrets hidden in the alien message that americans and japanese decided not to continue to investigate because of the great danger it presents.This continuation of the book answered to me some questions I've made to myself about the story after finishing the 1st part.Arthur continues developing some subjects that are still considered science fiction for no too much time; they are going to become real science."
3,NEANDERTHAL speakers!,"Well if you're looking for sheer brute FORCE, i.e. loudness loudness loudness with punchy bass, exaggerated highs and thin mid-range, then these are the dope, indeed. Perfect for headbangers and rappers, much less so for genres like classical or jazz which require more accuracy and naturalness than simple thumpety thump.Great if you like throwing house-shaking, police-provoking parties, there's a reason why these are real popular at frat houses especially. You will need a good strong amp to run them to get the maximum effect though, I'd even recommend a separate dedicated amplifier over an integrated receiver."
3,Well written but...,I like the style of the book but I found myself having to play around with code to get the examples to work. They seemed to work about 25% of the time without major tweaking. Maybe it is just me but this book needs a newer edition pronto. I'd look elsewhere for more up to date information.
2,Buzzword headache,"I should quote this book, but I really don't want to spend anymore time with it. The buzzword-speak is rife through this book, and it really hinders learning when you have to stop and think, 'Now what is that supposed to mean?'. I haven't learned much, and the only reason I don't give this 1 star is I got it for < $1 from amazon used. It had 3 1/2 stars when I bought it, and my new rule is not to shell out for anything less than 4 1/2."
2,Too Much and Confusing,"I bought this book to get understanding of POJOs. To see how they are much simpler to use than EJB, if they really are!!But this book tries to pack the whole project into it, which makes it hard to remember things after few chapters. It also tries to explain technologies (like Spring and Tapestry) in few pages, omitting the explanations where required. My opinion is, it requires pre-understanding of these technologies before you will find reading this book useful.Also, I was not convinced with writing style of author. Author tries to use complex words where they can be avoided and twisted sentences where same thing can be explained in plain English statements.Overall, I guess author has in-depth knowledge but he lacks the ability to express the knowledge in simple words"
5,Lush orchestral arrangements of Disney and Sherman favorites,"Mr. Hayman was the arranger for the Boston Pops orchestra through the '60's, '70's, and '80's. Many of these arrangements are featured on the Boston Pops recording ""Salute to Disney"" with Arthur Fiedler. The arrangements are extensive medleys from several movies and shows. These are great arrangements and the orchestra is phenominal, making these wonderful songs perfect for singing along."
2,Mixed Bag,"The concept sounded good, but the end result is a rather big letdown. I am a big fan of Richard Hayman (former arranger for the Boston Pops) and expected this CD to be something special, but it's hit or miss. The Mary Poppins medley is beautiful while, on the other hand, the Snow White medley is awful. Apparently these medleys are NOT arranged by Richard Hayman, a master at his craft. I couldn't help but feel that some of these lousy arrangements would be better suited for a high school marching band. With uneven playing and several really horrible renditions of Disney medleys, I cannot recommend this CD. Anyone want to buy a used CD real cheap?"
3,Huh?????,I'd like to pint out that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is not a Disney Film! Other wise it was pretty good.
1,Really?,"Why pay for something you get for free with interactive tutorials? Yes, westlaw took a long time to get with Lexisnexis's tutorials, but this product is now dated."
2,Not practical,It is not practical at all. Weired feeling when writing and you have to push in order to be able to write endagering the screen...
3,Necessary part for the Fein Turbo vacuums,"If you're doing woodworking or sanding, you need the HEPA filter (see my review of that part). To install the HEPA filter, you need this part.It came with no instructions but was not hard to figure out. Just takes a little force to get the screw into the hole in the flange (from the cup side). The flange fits into one end of the HEPA filter, and the screw locks the filter/flange/screw ""assembly"" in place."
3,Flange needed work,"I was very satisfied with the price I paid for the kit, but the casting for the flange was imperfect. The slots in the flange were formed only on one side, and there has to be a slot on two sides of the flange for the wings on the turn screw to fit through.It was not hard to cut another slot with a small Sawzall blade, but it would have been nice to have been able use the kit without having to modify one of the parts."
2,"Dull, clinking sound instead of a jingle","I didn't like how this tambourine sounded. The tambourine seems well designed except for the most important part: the jingles. The sound was a dull, rattling clink instead of a bright jingle. Onomatopoeia compelled me to return this tambourine. If a jingle doesn't jingle, it isn't a jingle.I ended up going into a music store in person and listening to the different tambourines, and picked a Meinl with dimpled brass jingles. Much brighter. More ""ching,"" less ""clack.""Meinl Tambourine, Brass jingles, mountable"
5,The Bad Boy of Rock and Roll's Literary Triumph!,"Diamond Dave is back, and in full swing in this rock and roll tell all book. Here, Dave is at his obnoxious best as he shares stories on the Van Halens, his solo career, and traveling the world. I never knew Dave was learned of global matters, the environment, and the music business today. Smart, funny, and down right addictive! A MUST read for all rock and roll fans!. Dave tells it like it is, and pulls no punches! A true original!!"
5,A Heartbreaking Work of Swaggering Genius,"St. Augustine, Benvenuto Cellini, Benjamin Franklin, and, now, David Lee Roth; I consider DLR among the great autobiographers of all time, and quite possibly the most entertaining human being alive. ""Heartbreaking"" only because they edited out 1200 pages -- where is the sequel?? (C'mon, Dave, give us a break!)"
3,Messy,"Sometimes good, sometimes great but overall this book is VERY laid back and sort of half baked. Roth writes with a Zen persona - so some stories dont really head anywhere and some anecdotes fade out before they should.Some of the time it works and certain chapters are funny, informative, and entertaining. Other times the Zen man doesn't deliver the goods.Overall the book is a must read for fans of classic Van Halen and DLR because there really is nothing else out there. Unfortunately, there is very little insight to the Van Halen machine at he height of their success.One additional note - my book is completely falling apart. The publishers used some garbage adhesive or something because I have barely touched the book and almost all the pages have come free from the binding. What kind of junk is that!!!??"
2,Looking for the inside scoop? It's not here,"Being a major fan of DLR (""Eat 'Em & Smile"" still blows away anything VH has released since ""1984"") and classic VH, I looked forward to reading Dave's book. Talk about a major disappointment. If you're looking for interesting stories involving Dave and the rest of VH or the DLR band, they're not here; I guess there just weren't any worthwhile times involving these people worth recounting (or Dave's pulling his punches.) Want information regarding anything recorded between VHII and 1984? It's also conspicuously absent. Where's the substance? We get more information on Dave's Vegas band (who really cares?) than VH and the DLR band combined. If that's what you're into, great. If not, ""Forget about it, Dave."""
5,A great Rock-N-Roll Story!,"I read the book and enjoyed it immensely. You must respect David Lee Roth in that he could have really dished some dirt on his former band members but refrained from doing so. Since the break-up of the original Van Halen, I have read so many negative comments from the Van Halen camp about Roth that it is sickening. I think Diamond Dave showed us who has some class and who does not. Regardless of what the critics, or anyone else for that matter, have to say about the book, if you are a classic Van Halen fan, it was an enjoyable read."
4,Fearless,"I can't believe I was up until 4AM, finishing reading ""Crazy from the Heat,"" David Lee Roth's autobiography. There are 57 chapters, and most are distinct mini-stories or opinions. It's like a ""freewheelin',"" stoned stream of consciousness. I don't know DLH personally, have never met him, but I got the feeling that this was as close as one gets to having a beer with him at a bar. And, for the most part, it was a lot of fun.The most interesting material were his historical references -- in particular, growing up in California during the 60's -- and his travel stories. He's also a savvy businessman: the truth behind the brown M&Ms; and paternity insurance is pure genius.Dave's an interesting guy... funnier, smarter, genuine, and more athletic than what I'd expect from an 80's hair band lead singer. He's a cross between Al Jolsten's song and dance, and Huck Finn's sense of adventure. Dave's fearless. I just wish he hadn't done that bluegrass version of ""Jump."""
3,Worth A Read.,"I just finished this book after reading it on and off for a few days. I'm glad I read it; Crazy from the Heat on the whole was worth a read. It did have a tendency to fluctuate in how interesting it was though--quite interesting at times, at other times just okay. David Lee Roth no doubt has had an experience-filled life and has much to tell. I was most interested when he talked of his career and times with Van Halen; his trips to places around the world was also cool to read about. I noticed how the writing and grammar wasn't quite proper, but it's got to have been written like that on purpose--whether it's informal writing or not, it added to the story. I think that I was always unclear about the circumstances of why he left Van Halen, but this book cleared that mystery up. Diamond Dave unquestionably is a free-spirited person that's not scared to take chances in life and that's great. This wasn't one of the best books I've read, but it wasn't bad either."
5,Everybody want's some!,"Great book! I was always curious and wanted to read the book, but when I read Dimebag's assesment of the book in Guitar Player Magazine, that sealed the deal! Dimebag was right, the books' an awesome read, mostly for me because, I grew up around the same time period as Roth, share similar experiences, and can identify with what was going on during those times, and therefore, can vouch for the histoical accuracy of his book. David Lee is a Bro', and a true original, one of a kind. What more can I say? Amen!... Rico."
4,An insight to Dave's mindset.,"I just got through with this book. Overall it was an easy read and gives you insight into Dave's philosophy and way of thinking. He always sees the glass half full and his stories inspire me to do the same. His message seems to be ""think BIG!!"" and enjoy the ride."
3,Not too bad,"I expected a rock star tale of excess and glory. Instead its basically a subtle statement from what turns to be a very calm and zen-like man. Interesting because Roth is way different then I imagined him to be, but not a captivating story. Not enough expose into the young Van Halen machine we deserve."
4,"DRUGS, SEX, AND ROCK AND ROLL BABY!",This is a very interesting book if you are interested in reading the exploits of one of the biggest rock bands ever!
5,This single is awesome!,"This single is sooo awesome! all u bsb fans need to get it cuz it has a really cool song, give me your heart, on it. that song is totally awesome! BSB RULZ 4 EVER!!!!"
4,"""A great cd to dance too""",The Backstreet boys are my Favorite band and this cd has new versions of Nobody but you and Give me your heart. The new versions are long version for Nobody for you and Prevoiusly unreleased for Give me your heart. If you want to know more about the Backstreet boys You can E-mail me.
2,NOT an 'Easy' piano book as stated,This is definitely not for someone with basic piano knowlege or even lessons 'a few years ago'. This is a challenging book for someone who hasn't been playing for awhile (or recently). I'm through book 2 of Alfred's adult lessons (and played as a kid) and it is challenging for me. I'll put it away for later.
4,Especially for lovers of classical music,"I have been playing the piano for only a few years, and I purchased this book with the hope of learning some of the most popular and most loved classical compositions. I am pleased to declare that I was not disappointed with this music book, filled with entertaining musical pieces. The first song I learned was Beethoven's well-known ""Fur Elise,"" and I was grateful that this beginners to intermediate level book made this piece less challenging to learn. If you are a dedicated and extremely devoted pianist (even if you've only been playing for a short time), this music book provides the perfect and valuable opportunity to get on the road to learning the songs of famous composers such as Liszt, Bach and Chopin. Impress your friends and family by playing the classical pieces available in this book. With 97 fabulous pieces of music to learn, there is no doubt that this book provides hours of learning and more importantly, fun."
3,Easy or not-so-easy....,"I haven't played the piano in a long time, but have been working my way back to remembering notes, etc. I looked forward to my ""Easy"" book of classics, and found the title a bit misleading. In my opinion, it is not for the casual player or someone not taking lessons. It is currently sitting in my piano bench waiting for me to work up to it.I thought I would have been able to use it right away, but was not. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad book, but I think it is a bit misleading calling it easy...."
1,this book is not for Kids!!,"This is definitely not for Kids. Three reasons:1. notes are too small;2. no finger numbers;3. notes print quality is no good.It does have a nice list of music. So if you are advanced, maybe try it if you don't mind the small notes."
4,"Nice melodies, no fingering information","It's a great book in the sense that it provides you with good music .. and those classical pieces aren't the distorted versions of the original ones.However, there is no information about fingering throughout the books, so you'll need to figure it out yourseflAnd like the authors mention: This book is not meant for casual piano players ... if you spend some time playing piano, then you should probably buy it ... However, if you play piano occasionally and casually, you should probably look for something different."
3,Not for Early Players,"I play piano and the pieces in this book are scaled down from the originals, but they are not easy for early players. I wouldn't recommend for this type of player. I bought it for my daughter, and she found it very frustrating. So it's on the shelf for now. The preface of the book even states that ""Early Players"" in the title was probably a stretch. For intermediate players, it's fine and probably just the challenge that they need."
3,Meager pickings on a well-stuffed CD,"To be honest, once you get past the few hits the rest is rather pedestrian rockabilly with more of an eye on commerce than artistry. 28 tracks is certainly generous, and the booklet is of top quality. Still, one can understand why Preston never achieved enduring success with this choice of material - it just doesn't hold up well."
3,talented guy,"Recently departed and very talented with a good voice, however it is quite obvious that after a about 6 choice hits the tunes went south. Too bad!"
2,Two stars for 2 great songs,"Recognizing Running Bear and Cradle of Love as absolute knock-out hitsof the early 60's and a must have for each record collector, the restof the songs are forgettable and often too much alike. One of theminor ""Collectables""."
2,Not so good...,"Received the table a couple days ago. Packaging was kinda shoddy as all the hardware had fallen out of its pouch and were free within the packing. The table also has multiple scratches to both the surface and legs. I haven't received the chairs yet (FedEx still has them... somewhere).Overall, I'm not all that happy with the table. But because I bought for ""casual"" use, I'm not dissatisfied enough to send it back. These two stars are in no way a reflection on the vender I purchased it through (they didn't manufacture it), just the product itself."
4,Good Movie,"I'm more a Naruto Shippuden fan, but watching this dvd reminded me of just why I fell in love with the first series. This movie while it has it's serious tones, is filled with enough goofy moments to make you laugh at just the right times, and the innocence of the characters like Naruto and Sakura opposed to Shippuden is enjoyable. The bonus material was the best part for me."
4,Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow,"I bought this movie for my twelve year old and he tells me that this movie is very good. He explains the difference in Naruto titles (Naruto and Naruto Shippuden:) as the same except the Shippuden series are the later episodes (Naruto is older in the Shippuden series 14-15 compared to 10-12 in the straight Naruto titles). This movie has all of the regular characters in it that are in the T.V. show, but it is a stand alone movie. He says that it would be better to know something about the Naruto show before watching this movie, otherwise you might get lost and not understand everything as well."
2,Oregon Handbook,As general reading this book is OK but I felt that it really missed the mark in its attempt to be a guide to Oregon. There seem to be a lot of holes in it. Also items that are listed in the index are not where they are supposed to be.
2,Reviewers are right,"Definitely a few things I agree that other reviewers noted:1) Small loaf - only really makes a 1 lb-er even if it gives instructions on a 1.5 loaf2) Rise problems - my boxes don't expire until 2012 but I still had rise problems. A friend from the culinary school nearby said it might be because there is a lot more whole wheat in it (a good thing for the body, not as good in the bread maker). As noted in another review, baking it in the oven really did make a better and higher loaf.3) Butter is best - tried oil and butter and butter is definitely better.4) A little more salt - I added an additional 1/2 tsp of salt and that seemed to help with the rise as well.It's a great backup for when you're out of bread flour or yeast but I still think the best bread machine recipe from allrecipes.com (subbing in 2 cups of flour, 1 cup whole wheat) makes for the most delicious and closest to store bought I've seen thus far."
3,I don't have good luck with this bread,"I make 2-3 loaves of bread a week. Some members of my family prefer a healthy wheat bread as opposed to the white flour breads so I bought this Honey Whole Wheat mix. Each time I make this bread, it doesn't raise nice like my other breads do. I only use the bread machine for the dough mixing and raising part of the prep. I then remove the dough punch it down and place it in a 9 x 5 bread pan so that I get a nice loaf shape rather than the crazy loaf that bakes in the machine pan. Anyway, I have made 6 loaves and just can't get this bread to raise as nice as others."
5,Great for company.,"If you really want to impress someone, have this bread baking when they walk in the door. It is so easy to load the bread machine with this bread or the 9 grain Hodgson Mill bread. I'd love to tell you that it stays soft for days but it's never lasted that long at our home. Great for sandwiches or just bread and jelly."
2,Do NOT like!!!!,"I have previously used the Hodgson 9-grain, and the White, and those were/are fine. But the resulting loaf from this mix came out hard, seemingly already stale, and just falls apart when trying to make/eat my sandwich. Not very tasty at all either. Easily, I like the White best (so far), and the 9-grain also good, especially being so healthy. Will NOT buy this Honey Whole Wheat again nor would I recommend it. But, who knows, maybe I just got a bad batch? But will not risk buying another..."
3,its ok but super dense,the box stuff is ok but they always come out super dense no matter what cycle i use or how i modify it. I did a fifty fifty on the box. it split the box in half and replaced what i took out with white and made a white wheat which turn out delicious and hadded two packets of honey it was super good after i did the modification
3,Good but too small,The flavor and texture are fine but the package only makes a one pound loaf. All my pans are for a 1 1/2 lb loaf. So I need to buy a new pan but I'd rather you increased the contents. I will now use 1 1/2 boxes to make a proper sized loaf.
3,A little too dry,This bread mix wasn't bad but we thought it lacked flavor and was a little too dry. Nothing special.
3,HONEY WHOLE WHEAT MIX,"I had never bought a box mix before. I bought the PK of 6 to use with my bread machine to make rolls and bread. It didn't save more than 3 mins to making my own mix. Two of the six packages did not come out well. Heavy, didn't rise. I didn't change anything. I make everything from scratch and have decided to make my own mix for pizza, rolls, or bread. I watch my yeast and I have no idea how old or damage the yeast in this mix are."
2,"Service - great, Product ??","I received the product quickly. I have used two of the boxes of bread mix, neither one turned out the way they should have.. my fault?? I don't know. Could be... I don't know but still the bread too heavy, and I have baked whole wheat bread before.."
1,Did not rise.,"The smell of this bread in the bread machine was amazing. Unfortunately, that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this product. It did not rise, so what came out of the bread machine was a misshapen clump of doughy stuff that tasted horrible. I use my bread machine frequently with the Hodgson Mill White bread mix and it turns out great. This Honey Whole Wheat mix was definitely disappointing."
3,Tastes a bit bland,"We expected Honey Wheat to actually have a taste, but this particular bread came out rather bland. It's not a bad bread, but we'll be looking for something else for next time."
4,"High Quality Bread, but Could Be a Little Sweeter","The quality of this bread was very good. It made a beautiful loaf, but I thought it needed to be a little sweeter, especially since it was called HONEY Whole Wheat Bread Mix. It must have had a miniscule amount of honey in the mix. The next time I make it, I will add probably at least 1/3 cup of honey to the mix. Overall it was very good."
5,Delicious,Excellent product was delivered prompty and in outstanding condition. Easy to prepare. Great bread.
1,Deflating Top,"I made this bread and the European Cheese and Herb bread. I have a new Cuisinart Bread Maker, and the Cheese & Herb bread has always turned out gorgeous and yummy!The Whole Wheat, however, flops! See the photos. Every loaf turned out this way......"
1,Not very Good - Did not Rise - Solid Like a Brick.,"I ordered 6 of these at once and the first 4 of them were not good at all. They smelled good while cooking but did not rise well, did not form a good loaf shape and were too solid after they were finished cooking. I may have received old or bad yeast, but the date on the box said 06/06/12 so it the yeast should have still been good. I kept trying thinking the next box would be better. By the time I decided to return what I had left, it was too much trouble to return as Amazon would not allow it. I will not be buying any more of this brand again."
2,This video is for children who have mastered letter sounds.,"This video gives four fifteen minute sessions. Each session begins with learning different word/families. It then reads a short story, sounding out each word. It repeats the story, allowing the child to read the story. Your child will recognize these words by sight through the repetitions. Your child will not be taught to differentiate letter sounds or connect sounds to clusters of letters/words. My seven year old found this video boring."
3,Okay serving mat,"This is a very inexpensive serving mat so in it's defense it is what it is. Mine had some little defects from the manufacturer but they were minor enough I didn't bother returning it. It's a good size for any bar and doesn't come with any silly marketing logos so if you're looking for simple then it's a homerun. I gave it a 3 star because it's okay, not great and not bad."
3,Good but lacking,"I used this book for my undergraduate IC engines course. It is well written, well put together, and concise. That being said Pulkrabek leaves out a lot when it comes to the actual calculations. This would be good for getting a general knowledge of IC engine cycles but for more advanced study Heywood's text is much more comprehensive. I used Heywood's text for my master's thesis."
5,Required text - but useful,"using for my Propulsion Systems class. The text is very easy to follow, and starts with the basics and begins breaking them down into more detailed explanation. Much easier than many textbooks out there. Good for someone with basic knowledge of thermodynamics and mechanical systems."
4,A Great Beginning....,"This first book by Robin Burcell is a good read and a great beginning. It has the same pitfalls that many new authors seem to fall victim to; it is not as tightly woven as I would have liked and there is not enough insight into the characters. I also felt as if I had missed a previous book with more of the background of Inspector Gillespie. However, just as ""A is for Alibi"" (see Sue Grafton's alphabet series) wasn't a true indicator the series' potential, I believe future books by Robin Burcell will only continue to get better.""Every Move She Makes"" stars San Francisco Police Inspector Kate Gillespie, a smart, tough police office with a weakness for latte's and a certain IA investigator that she can't get too close to.... add into the mix an untrustworth ex, a solid mystery, and the beautiful background of San Francisco and you have all the ingredients of a good book. I hope Inspector Gillespie enjoys a nice long run, I am very much looking forward to more!"
5,"""Fantastic""! The best book I have read in a long time!","This is a great book! I picked it up on a whim at my local Used Book Store and I finished it in 48 hours. I loved Kate Gillespie. She was smart, strong and daring.There was so much to love about this book. First, the mystery surrounding Kate's partner was riveting....Kate's ""new"" realationship with Mike ""torrid"" Torrance was so mysterious and romantic. I love them together. Not so with her creepy ex-husband, but I loved to hate him! I can't wait until the next Kate Gillespie book comes out! I believe this is the best book I have read so far this year. Thanks Robin Burcell! You are a wonderful writer."
5,Can't wait for the next one!,"This book had me from the opening paragraph and kept me up all night reading. I love reading insider stories and this one is like a video of the day-to-day life of a police officer. The best part is that it's done seamlessly--no long explanations that interrupt the story. Bravo, Ms. Burcell. I'll be standing in line (or the first online) to buy the next one."
3,"Cheezy but works, kinda","My first job was to clean the sawdust out of my table saw.The holes were not sized very well and I had to really work at getting the hose nozzels in. It just sits on top of the bucket and is held on by the vacuum. Obviously, when the shop vac is off, it does not hold very well. It is top heavy and falls over regularly. But with great care, I filled up the bucket with sawdust. It does trap much the sawdust instead of putting it into the shop vac bag.Would I buy it again? No. I would cut a round piece of plywood and cut two holes for the shop vac hose, then bunge cord it to the bucket. Put a weight on the bottom so it does not tip over and presto, you would have a much better dust collector."
1,does not fit as advertised by Woodcraft,"I give it a star for price as I purchased on sale at a local Woodcraft store for $16. However, I will be returning it. Woodcraft's website says this fits 2-1/2"" shop vac hoses. Wrong. A standard 2-1/2"" vacuum hose is too small to fit over the connector and too large to fit inside it. In fact, they are similar diameters. ONly the fact that the cyclone's connectors are a thicker plastic than the vacuum hose, make them somewhat different diameters both inside and out. I do not want to take time to force fit or search out adapters to make the connections work. It is also true the lid fits loosely on 5-gallon buckets and you would also need to rig a way to strengthen the fit so dust did not escape and so the lid did not fall off when hoses are moved or the bucket bumped. A total dud in my opinion."
1,Look before you buy.,"i purchased on of these separators, the mini, and found an immediate problems. I could not find ANY five gallon metal trash cans anywhere without paying more in shipping than for the can. Most trash cans are now in 6 gallon format and WILL NOT FIT THIS SEPARATOR. I would consider the larger adapter made for the fifty five gallon metal trash can. If not, you will be making a lot of adjustments and trying to find a way to seal the lid so that this will work. The manufacturer should re-mold this product to match the six gallon metal trash can to be usable.Before you buy this product, take a look at local sources for a metal trash can that will fit a twelve inch diameter lid.I hope this review is useful to those who really want a turnkey product without a lot of engineering to make work."
3,OK as standalone - but not with other Mr Nozzle attachments,OK this item is as advertised and does attached to the Mr. Nozzle (red) hose. Both attachments are for uncarpeted floors as implied but not specially stated (ie not for carpets). However the straight solid extensions will not accept the two attachments shipped with the Mr. Nozzle hose set. Still no way to use those two items with solid extensions.
3,"Lite read, mis-leading title.",Book was personal about certain managers at ML. Very common for industry. No earth shattering cases. Just routine sales management for whole industry.
1,"""The Insider"" it is not","This is the kind of self-aggrendizing drivel you should expect in a self published book. I guess no one else was interested in publishing the story.The author worked in a tiny offie in a backwater town and took it upon himself to contact ""senior management"" in wiritng. I bet he is writing to Bush about the war in Iraq as we speak. I'm sure he will be self-publishing a new book very soon about how Bush ignored his concerns and tried to get his day in international court in The Hague.Save your money and by a book from an author who didn't have to pay to get it published."
2,T.S. is right,"I followed T.S.'s advice and bought the competing product. It was a little tricky to find, because it's actually called the CleanStream filter, by Gore. It really does fit beautifully."
3,Much Cheaper To Get the FBK Kit With All Pieces,This looks like the same filter which comes included with the kit Amazon sells as the Fein FBK Filter Bag kit. I just purchased and installed that FBK kit on my Fein Turbo II vac and I am thrilled with it. Better dust collections and the convenience of disposable bags. The bags have a very large collection volume. Suction with the bag + filter seems better than it did with the original cloth liner alone. That kit is less than half the price of the filter here alone. Seems like an easy decision.
4,Let me say......WELCOME BACK MR. HUGGINS,"FIRST let me say that the only reason this book has four stars is because of the TYPOS . That is the only reason. I was let down a little by Huggins's last book Nightbringer and was skeptical at first about this one but as i read through it my attitude changed. Good plot, characters, everything. whether your a huggins fan or not you WILL enjoy this book. BRAVO!"
5,Good Thriller,"This book is more along the line of Huggins'The Reckoning: A NovelA political tale that starts out very creepy, and keeps you on the edge throughout the book. A lot of shooting and slaying of the enemy (and a few good guys too) this is a page turner. Though not like my favorite of hisA Wolf Story: A Novel of Savage Conflict and Desperate Faiththis is still a very good read."
5,Harlem Style: Desiging for the New Urban Aesthetic,Loved it! Full of really interesting historical information as well as beautiful photos. I leave it on my coffee table for others to enjoy!
2,Some movies don't age well,"I recently watched the movie ""Chinatown"". The movie is truly a classic. As much of a pleasure to see now as it was when I originally saw it in the theater.While not in the same class as Chinatown, I also recently saw ""Bodyheat"" with Kathleen Turner. Turner's beauty and the classic noir nature of this film make it ageless.Unfortunately ""Crimes of Passion"" didn't age well for me. I found that the film felt dated and sexist in the way Turner's character is portrayed. Some people who have reviewed the film here found the film's ""analysis"" of relationships fascinating. I found it depressing and naive. The idea that a prostitute is going to fall in love with a client because of he has passionate sex with her is sophmoric.I wanted to rent this film, but I couldn't find it at the local Blockbuster. After buying it, I've put in the box for the used bookstore (which also sells used DVDs)."
1,Horrible,"I bought this movie because I like Kathleen Turner. Wow, she's got to be embarrassed looking back on this clunker. Did some high school senior write and direct this thing? It's clumsy, has no real storyline, and it's not even erotic. The acting is mediocre, too, by today's standards. About a half hour into the movie I got the idea that it was not going to get any better, and I had to force myself to watch it to the end. At least the video was crisp, which brings me to another point. Somebody goes to the trouble to clean up this piece of crap, yet there are good movies out there (All of Me, Roxanne, Cabaret, Another Woman, to name a few off the top of my head) that deserve remastering, yet are not. I don't get it."
1,Absolutely Awful,"Honestly? I wish I could erase my memory of seeing this film. Terribly lowbrow, uninspiring, stupid.What is Kathleen Turner doing in this mess? Even more perplexing than Nicolas Cage in Ghost Rider.The dialog is of middle school quality, the characters one-dimensional. Use two hours if your life for something better than this, like watching grass grow."
5,"""Goodbye, China Blue""","I consider myself lucky to find this cult classic on DVD with an awesome deep blue cover and the words ""unrated, uncensored"". Although I've been watching it so many times on video, the uncut version on DVD including some newly restored footage is a real bonus, let alone its other bonus materials, like the commentaries and a whole bunch of deleted scenes. ""Crimes of Passion"" is the kind of film that ignites different thoughts on each viewer's mind, although the talents of its director and actors are undeniable to everybody. The sarcastic, witty dialogue is another achievement that can be fairly compared to ""All About Eve"". I for one have been deeply impressed by the innumerable outrageously funny lines exchanged among the characters. One line, however, sounded like a sad memorable quote, not just because it wrapped up the whole plot but it also reminded us of an exceptionally talented and ill-fated actor -- Anthony Perkins: ""Goodbye, China Blue""."
4,"Good, but not his absolute best","I'm probably somewhat unusual among Jarrett Trio fans in that I like his more recent work better than his recordings from the 80's/early 90's. It may have something to do with the production--this CD, like the original Standards 1 and 2, has a kind of echoing quality a little too reminiscent of George Winston-style New Age piano, for my taste at least. The version of ""Blame It On My Youth"" is very good here, but Jarrett's playing is decorative and even sappy at times, unlike the version on ""The Melody At Night, With You,"" which is stripped down and utterly heartbreaking. Also, uncharacteristically, DeJohnette plays these little trills on the ride cymbal that break the mood and almost ruin the whole performance. If you want to hear Jarrett at the absolute pinnacle of his trio work, try the recent ""Up For It,"" or my favorite, ""At the Deer Head Inn"" (with Paul Motian sitting in for DeJohnette)."
5,The Cure,I LOVE this CD. One of my all time favorites and I highly recommend this to any KJ trio fans!!!
2,5 Stars for Playing 1 star for retard animals sounds,"GREAT playing, but everyone once in a while some retard starts moaning and making bizare sounds that the engineer should have gotten rid of... oh wait, that is the piano player... what a schmuck... there, I said it... what MANY people have been meaning to say... Keith is so freakin' great if he just shut up when he played. The occasional moan is fine, but come on."
5,U-Boat War,"For anyone who is interested in the history of submarines, submarine warfare, and WW2 specifically this book is a must. The photos in it take you into the heart of the depths along the crew. The text is well written and enhances the what the photos show. Reading through the book made me count my blessings, and ideology aside it will make you respect the men who served in the U-Boats."
5,Die Hard Riki Michele Fan,I am a huge fan of Riki Michele's music and was happy to find this album again since my original got lost during a move. Great stuff.
4,This film will take you by total surpise.,"""Night Visitor"" is one of those strange little underrated CULT films that incorporates a tremendous amount of sickness with a limited amount of blood. This movie is packed with familiar character actors (Elliott Gould, Richard Roundtree, Shannon Tweed, Allen Garfield, Michael J. Pollard and Henry Gibson, just to name a few) and relies on strong storyline and performances instead of gore. Allen Garfield's portrayal of a Satanic Serial Killer is worthy of an Oscar. The sight of Michael J. Pollard attacking Elliott Gould with a chainsaw has to be seen to be believed. I highly recommend this film for anyone with a warped sense of humor."
2,"Movie is not that bad, but has nothing to do with Satanism.","I remember seeing this movie on Showtime back in 1997. I have mixed opinions about this movie. First off, the film itself is not that bad. The actors are good except for Derek Rydall and his girlfriend. This is the kind of movie that you watch when you really haven't got anything better to do.My biggest complaint about this film is in its portrayal of Satanism. As anyone who has knowledge of the subject knows this is NOT what Satanists do. With that said, Allen Garfield's ritual chamber is nice (love the goat head bell) and I also noticed that his text during the ritual (""I invoke thee from thy resting place..."") is taken from the fabled ""Necronomicon"" book.As a Satanist, I found this movie laughable. Watch it, but don't take it seriously. If you want to waste time, see this movie. If you want some good, entertaining movies that deal with Satanism, see ""Rosemary's Baby"" or even ""The Ninth Gate""."
1,Should be XXX rated.,This video requires some further description before someone orders it - and the other review was not available when I ordered it. It's wrapper describes nudity and has an online sex site address. I would not recommend to anyone just wanting to see a video about the history or parades of Mardi Gras.
1,Night Journeys Bokk Review,"Peter York is eleven years old and was adopted by the Shinn family. Peter wants to rescue Elizabeth and Robert, two slaves who are children. But Mr. Shinn doesn't want him to. The story took place in Trenton, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in the year 1768.I would recommend this book to a boy who likes adventures because the main character is a boy that goes on a lot of adventures. I didn't like this book because I did not like peters adventures. Maybe someone who likes river adventures would like this book. I would not want to recommend this book to my friends.The problem in night Journeys is that Peter and the two slaves want to escape with out the Shinn family knowing. Will Mr. Shinn find out or not?"
2,"Dull,Dull,Dull,Dull...","This is the worst Ripley book.The plot lacks narrative drive and goes nowhere. Ok, Bernard Tuft is a very good caracther and there are some flashes of Higsmight's talents but in general is dull and slow reading."
5,A Worthy Second Novel for the Series,"Tom Ripley has aquired a beautiful wife and a lovely home in the French countryside. As Tom's life can never be without conflict, Tom finds himself caught in the middle of a forgery scandal that could destroy the world he has made for himself. We find Mr Ripley a little older, a little wiser and a little more sure of his ruthless capabilities. The Author, Patrica Highsmith, stretched the lines of plausibility on this one just a little, but then again we are talking about the ever scheming Thomas Ripley."
3,Not as good as the others...,"This was a really slow read. Although I love the Tom Ripley character it was hard to enjoy this book as I already knew he was an evil, deceitful character. It wasn't as suspenseful as ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" when the reader wasn't quite sure about Ripley's character yet. Still, it is a good mystery novel and worth the time."
2,Ripley Under Ground,"Hello? Where is the nervous, insecure, most probably insane pathological liar we met in the excellent ""Talented..."" This book is a weak sequel, with an improbable plot, and a house full of guests that has Ripley running back and forth like a character in a 1930's comedy. How stupid are the police? A seasoned detective can't tell the guy's wearing makeup and a fake beard from a few feet away? The ending is just ridiculous: the cop takes Ripleys word about some very strange goings on in the middle of the Salzburg woods, and that's the end of it. If it were this easy to get away with murder, I would have tried it myself."
2,Amoralists can't all be this dull.,"I thought I'd try this book because I enjoyed both of the films about Ripley. But take away the acting of Matt Damon and John Malkovich and Ripley loses his depth as a fascinatingly ambiguous amoralist, and turns into just a bore in a dressing gown who happens to kill a lot of people. Furthermore, Highsmith seems to have only one literary trick up her sleeve: describe a bunch of horrific acts in deadpan, Hemingwayesque prose so that your reader can shiver and marvel at the incongruity of it all. Well, ho hum."
3,Not so great,"Unlike some of the other Ripley books, this one was poorly written and was made even more difficult by the language references made throughout. Not the fastest read although the characters were interesting."
4,Promising Debut By Chris Clark,"There's a slightly amateurish feel to this album, and at this point Chris Clark cannot hold a candle to Squarepusher or Aphex Twin. On the other hand, it is also an ambitious album that promises good things to come. It's also original, creative, and diverse, which already sets him apart from the masses of wannabes. Tracks range from icy ambient to whimsical. ""Proper Lofi"" is a fantastic trip in drill'n'bass. ""Lord Of The Dance"" and ""Diesel Raven"" are fun radio-friendly tracks. Chris Clark's strength seems to be in exploiting the melodic use of noise. It's a rather enjoyable album. I think this album goes well with Ohgr's ""Welt"". Also be sure to visit the Warp Records mini-site for this album, where there's a free MP3 of the unreleased track ""Guitar Solo"""
4,Nice,"Quite simply...this is a great cd of electronic music. if youi are a fan of Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, or early Autechre, you'll flip over this. Chris Clark is creative and konws how to keep you listening for more. enjoyable."
4,Good yet generic,This version of Mozart's Die Zauberflote is a very good one yet is lacking in any personality. Most Naxo's recordings are like this. The singers are a talented bunch but give no real personality to the characters. Herbert Lippert's Tamino is one of the most generic I have ever seen yet is still good vocally. The same goes for the Pamina of Elisabeth Norberg-Schulz. Georg Tichy's Papagano is a spirited try but lacks emphasis. The Sarastro of Kurt Rydl (the only person in here I knew before I bought it) was excellent. Hellen Kwon's Queen is very good. The orchestra and conductor are good (as they were in Don Giovanni.) My verdict: buy the highlights of this recording (also available on Amazon.) You won't regret it.
5,Psychological Multiple Personalities Demonic Battle for Peace,"Angela battles demons and needs redemption in order to reunite her multiple personalities.***In this, her first published book, author Jean Marie Haugen carefully draws you into horrible circumstances where Angela's multiple personalities must find love and redemption to survive a major fight between sanity vs. insanity, God vs. Satan, demons vs. saints. Angela develops split personalities to hide from the terrible realities or neglect, abuse and non-consensual sex. A car accident resulting from a terror-ridden panic flight leaves Angela hospitalized in the care of a surgeon that just may hold not only the skills to save her life, but the key to a kingdom to save her soul. Angela must make a choice between suicide and sanity. Just what will it take for her to merge her multiple personalities into one personality? Her story is not for the faint hearted."
4,The last Jew of Wegrow,"I know the author of this book,he is a very interesting man.What he went through during the war is indescribable.This book gives a view of the nazi's that I have never read before.I could not put this book down.If you are afan of World War 2 this is a must read."
5,Journey Through Womanhood,"I absolutely love this book. It doesn't matter what page I open to, there is always something personally pertinent and thought provoking. What a fantastic, spiritual guidebook this is!"
3,Work with some work,"First of all: If this is all you can find, still get it! Mine works fine. However, there are some models out there that I think would be easier to hook up (google trash dust separator).I couldn't find a trash can that fit exactly (it fits a 21 inch external dia. can and I could only find a 20 inch dia. can). I put some air conditioner foam around the edge of the trash can and this sealed it fine, however. I thought I'd have to strap it on the trash can but you don't...it sits on fine.There is no clear fit of the hose to the openings, so I did this: I drilled a hole in the top of each hose entry point and ran a 8 gauge 10-32 bolt through the top and into the 4 inch hose where it entered the top. I put a washer on the outside on top of this unit and a washer and nut inside the hose and thus bolted the hose to the separator. The hoses now fit snuggly and securely. The system works quite well."
3,Not as pictured........,"First off let me say that it works and that it does so pretty well. However.....the item is certainly not as pictured. The way it fits my 30 gal metal trash can reminds me of a little kid trying to walk in his/her parents shoes! Waaaay too big, overhanging each side by probably 6"" or so. I finally had to bungee it on the can so that it would stay in place. As an earlier review noted, connection of the hoses is not that easy either. If you have the clear, wire-reinforced hoses you can thread them in like a screw. Otherwise you may need to add some sort of connector."
3,No Hose Connectors,I think the separator is a great product and adds life to vacuum motors/fan blades and makes chip disposal a snap. The only disappointing feature was that when it arrived there were no hose connections. However I also ordered the 50 foot hose sold by the same manufacturer. It has a spiral wire in it with a web of soft plastic between the spirals. By turning the hose a few reverse turns you can then screw it into the collector nozzels (no clamp required). Having a soft web between the spiral wire allows the supple plastic web to be drawn up against the nozzel edge to form a seal.
2,incomplete/overpriced,"The idea is great. However, the it is way overpriced for a piece of ABS plastic. I has no instructions. I does not provide for a place to attach hoses. For this price you should not have to run around, spend more time and money to figure out a way to attach the hose."
2,Doesn't fit normal trash can!,"I'm not sure what giant trash can this is designed for, but not any one you can buy at home depot. It is a constant hassle adjusting the lid so that you can maintain suction. As mentioned before attaching your hoses is pretty sloppy with lots of suction loss as well. I guess with some modifications it may work better, but if I'd wanted to make my own I would have do it."
4,Great Concept/Minor Equipment Flaw,"Conceptually, I think the separator is a great product and adds life to vacuum motors/fan blades. The only disappointing feature was that when it arrived there were no connections to attach the hood to the hoses. Apparently, the hose is supposed to loosely fit into the separator holes. However, this setup causes a loss of vacuum in the overall system. Consequently, I had to purchase additional connectors and hose clamps to solidly connect the hose to the collector. For the price, I think the collector should come with connectors built in to accomodate a 4"" hose."
1,Terrible design,I purchased this design over a year ago. You have to push the hose through the opening and clamp it into place from the inside. You can fix this with sealant and pipe or like I did with duct tape which will leak. I recently found another one at Woodcraft that is made much better and has fittings that you clamp the hoses onto. Brilliant!Save yourself a major headache and disappointment and buy the one from Woodcraft.
3,Loud Audience,"All of the other reviews are correct. But, I feel more emphasis should have been placed on Bellini. I would have liked to have heard more of him and less of the audience. I find ""LIVE"" performances annoying anyway. But, this production has the audience doing more work than any of the singers. If Wagner had written this opera, any audience member chopping off the ending of arias with applause would be taken out and shot.I would also mention, as has been done by other reviewers, that only the first 17 pages of the booklet are in English. I really like a libretto in English with my opera - even when the opera is sung in English, as this one isn't."
5,Quality recording of a great opera,"This is a superb quality recording; and, a joy to listen to with the great Luba Orgonasova voice to enjoy. It will make for many enjoyable hours of listening."
4,I go out walking after midnight,"Of course this is a very strange opera, with hilarious moments (the villagers come straight out of Frankenstein movies), and it is hard to imagine anyone trying to direct it without bringing out the ""id on the move"" subtext! I occasionally think that La Sonnambula was Morbius' favourite music on the Forbidden Planet.This is a fine performance, marred only by the Lisa (Dilber) who is beyond shrill, more like a pierced arrow through the eardrums."
3,Above average,"For Twain enthusiasts definitely recommended. For others the book may be found lacking. There are definitely some highlights here for everybody, but mostly the Twain devotees.If you're not a big fan of Twain I'd skip it. if you are an admirer of the Great One, then dig in."
5,"After all, this is Mark Twain",There isn't much here that needs to be said: four brilliant classics by the greatest communicator in the history of American Literature at a good price. What more could you ask for?
5,Extend the reach of your wet/dry vac even further!,This unique extension hose is the perfect accessory for my wet/dry vac. It comes with a cuff attachment which attaches to the Mr. Nozzle Wet/Dry Vac's Tool Kit for an even greater reach. Mr. Nozzle suggests that a 36ft. extension is the maximum reach for a standard wet/dry vac without deleting the suction power and I have found that the vac's ability is not hampered by the 36ft. reach. I really appreciate the ability to station my vac without having to manipulate it in all directions when in use.
4,The Berenstain Bears and the Missing Dinosaur Bone,Great book for young readers. Easy to read and understand. Great pictures to follow along with if unable to read.
5,NICE BOOK,"Exactly what I was looking for and more.Arrived as described, and in even better condition! It is not a hard cover, a has the look and is a BEAUTIFUL book!I was very happy with the product!!!!"
3,Make sure you have a place on the block to stick it to.,"I took for granted I had a place on the block to stick it to and didn't. I found a small spot but couldn't get a solid connection so it didn't heat very well. I wasn't able to access whether the 200 watts were good for my needs. Otherwise, it seems like a solid unit. I gave it to my son because he has a big block but he hasn't tried it yet."
2,poor performance,This heater wouldn't heat the oil in my electric air compresser enough to start it in cold weather. The compresser is inside.
2,I was disappointed,I was disappointed in it. It has not sovled my problem at all. Maybe just not big enough for the application.
5,Good Heater for motorcycles and scooters.,"I had an old one of these years ago. It had the handle coming out of the heater at 90 degrees and had no guard to keep your hand from sliding down to the heater. I couldn't find it (I think a friend borrowed it and never returned it), so I bought this unit. I use it to extend the season for my scooter riding. The scooter pretty much wants to have a 75 degree or hotter day in order to start. I have found that by using the heater, I can get the scooter to start as cold as 50 degrees. I really like the low profile of the handle, and especially the guard to keep my hand from sliding onto the heating element like it used to with the old model. I plan on using this on my car if the weather gets to cold here in the northeast. Definitely a good buy if you need this sort of heater (It is in fact a good heater to keep metal pipes from freezing as well)."
2,Magnetic Heater,"It works but is very weak. It gets hot but doesn't seem to transfer heat well. If you want to warm anything of any size from cold, get something else."
2,"Gets Hot, But Takes Time To Heat Things",This heater gets hot to the touch fast! But it takes a long time to transfer that heat to liquid in the pan. Perhaps I had unrealistic expectations. Perhaps if it is left on all night?
3,ok but underpowered,holds on to oil pan very well but 200 watts just isn't enough when it's bitter cold. What are you going to do with 200 watts in subzero temps? Its like bringing a slingshot to a tank fight.
3,Kat's Heater,"The heater works great, my only issue is that my CubCadet motor is mostly aluminum so the magnet is useless. I'm able to stick it onto the oil filter but I think I should have gone with a dipstick type instead - but those suppsoedly are not the greatest either.."
2,not worth the money,"I have this unit for a couple of days, got it to warm up my Branson Tractor had the unit plugged in for 3 or so hours the unit was hot but the oil pan was cold. dont waste your money"
5,exceeds expectations,Needed to heat the air intake port for the pellet stove so it would easily automatically ignite at very low empty cabin temps. NO PROBLEMO:)
4,Katt engine heater,"Does what it is supposed to, though the first one I got did not last long. We shall see how long this one lasts."
2,I should have bought the larger wattage,"It help[s, I guess, in sub zero weather for the truck, but when I tried to use it to heat a hot tub of water for my feet, it doesn't even warm it."
3,NOT FOR MOTORCYCLES!,"gave it 3 stars because it seems to be a quality product, a very strong magnet, and heats up quickly, so I'm sure it does the job for its intended purpose...which is not for motorcycles. Motorcycles apparently have Aluminum or composite metal pans, as this magnet would not stick to any of my 3 motorcycles."
5,Block Heater,I use this heater on the oil pan of my car when the temperatures are way below zero. It does an effective job keeping the oil warm and made starting the car easier. I was going to try using it on my snowthrower but couldn't because the engine block was aluminum. If you're going to buy this heater just make sure whatever you're going to use it on will attract a magnet. The magnet is strong and holds well.
2,Not even worth $1 each,"Bought these based on the other 2 reviews. Guess I got the bottom of the barrel, almost all are used logo balls, at least 20% are quite definitely 'used', a few are what I expected (basically new). I'll not try to send them back, I'll just use them for practice or something. Disappointed.Added next day - OK, after putting these on the back shelf I decided to examine each one. Here's the breakdown - 17 are almost new (logos), 6 are OK, and 13 are too worn for me to put in play. Half are red Big Berthas, half blue. So, 23 balls for $30, still cheaper than new I suppose, just. Still, not as advertised."
5,Great balls for a great price!,"These balls were better looking than I expected them to be. Not a single one of them had a scratch on them. Most of the balls did have some sort of logo on them which may bother some people but it didn't bother me. The balls performance was great too. I averaged a little more distance using these than the balls I previously used. I will buy some of these again in the future as long as the price is right. They were all Callaway Big Bertha balls as opposed to some assortment. Shipping was free too using the Super Saver Shipping, I got them in about 6 days including the weekend. Another satisfied purchase from Amazon!"
3,Down to you,Got the DVD in good conditions and it is a really good movie. Everything was good and I am happy with my purchase and the seller.
5,"Great Date Movie, I Loved It","This movie is a wonderful dipiction of how the one that got away is never completely gone. This movie helped me to not give up hope and get that ONE back. Freddy and Julia have great moments in this movie that show the real side of relationships. The writers found how to touch audiences at a level that they may have wondered about before but never knew the answers to. If you are a romantic, like myself, or into some comedy than this movie will suit you."
2,DOWN TO YOU,ITS A TYPICAL ROMANCE STORY WITH A FEW SEMI-DIFFERENT TWISTS BUT WITH THE SAME PREDICTABLE HAPPY ENDING. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THAT IT HAD FREDDIE PRINCE JR IN IT BECAUSE WITHOUT HIM I DOUBT ANYONE WOULD EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THE FILM ON DVD. WILL SCREEN WRITTERS EVER COME UP WITH ANYTHING NEW ?
2,Why Julia? Why Freddie?,"Ok, I rented this movie thinking it to be a fairly good movie. Really, I didn't know what to think since noone I knew had seen it, neither had I seen any reviews written anywhere, and it didn't stay in the theater long here. So I rented, and watched it. It seemed like forever while I was watching it. All I am asking is why waste GREAT talent (Freddie Prinze, Jr., Julia Stiles) on such a dull movie. Don't get me wrong, their acting was great (except for Selma Blair playing a porn star), but the plot was totally predictable. When the credits rolled, I understood why noone reviewed this nor saw it."
5,"Loved It, and I'm a guy!","Now, you could call this a girls type of movie. 'Chick flick' for the lack of a better term. I was draged to go see it with my grilfriend. By the way the studio's know we get draged to see these type of films and cash in on the both of us. Anyhow, this movie was 'real'. When you watch it, you say ya, that's what we went through and that's how we fell in love and that's how we felt and that is how confusing things can get and thouse are the things that happen to people. Really captures love and relationships of 90s."
5,good movie that's down to earth,"this is a nice movie about first falling in love.Freddie Prinze and Julia Styles meet at a bar and fall in love. you go with them through out their relationship and you watch them grow and learn.a nice movie with a good cast. the cast includes Austin Kutcher, Selma Blair (Cruel Intentions), Shawn Hatosy (The Facutly), Rosario Dawson, Zak Orth and Henry Winkler.i enjoyed this movie every much because it's a feel good movie about first falling in love. it's also more down to earth, more real life than some other cheesey love movies. but this movie just doesn't deal with love, it deals with friendships and growing in life as a person. Shawn Hatosy is freaking awsome in this movie. i also like Monk. just a very feel good movie.this movie also happens to have my favorite song of all time, Al Green's Let Stay Together. Not only does this song come out in Down to You, but Julia Styles also dances to the song.a very nice movie.i liked it."
1,Really bad,I rented this movie when I was home with the flu. I was bored and wanted something to watch. But even though I was bored and would've watched about anything I did'nt even watch the whole movie. It was that bad. It's a really typical romance movie and you know what will happen all the time. The actors are'nt very very bad but they can't make this movie interesting. If you like hollywood romance movies maybe you'll like this. Otherwise DON`T buy this.
5,Loved the movie and the way it was presented was quite unique.,"This is a story about college kids who grow into adults, and the trials of the relationship as they grow. Filled with believable problems associated with one's growing into maturity. The mistakes one makes, etc...The realization that love can endure when faced with said trials. Very good story."
5,old school love movie,"my wife and i watched this movie years ago and love it, when i saw it on Amazon i immediately ordered it....the price was perfect too"
2,Disappointed,"Julia Stiles was awesome in 10 Things I Hate About and that's when I started to like her a lot. When this movie came out I really wanted to see it and ended up renting it. Good thing I did because I usually just buy movies w/out watching them first. This movie was very disappointing. There was not a real plot and the movie moved on very slowly, I was dieing for it to end! The way they met was dumb and I didn't even want them to be together. The charactors lacked human abilities such as conversation or good intelligant conversations. My advice is to skip this one."
1,Not even worth renting...,"I wasn't forced into seeing this movie while it was in the theater, I actually went willingly. I can't decide if that or the actual watching of the movie was more painful... I hated this movie. It was boring, unfunny, and immature. I thought the acting was second-rate(at best) and the plot could have used a LOT of help. But overall the most annoying thing about the whole affair was how utterly unrealistic the whole thing was. For one, they have unprotected sex about 300 times! Did she really think that she could do that WITHOUT getting pregnant? Give me a break. And who drinks a bottle of shampoo to get over a lost love? That's not romantic, that's just plain sick. In short, if you want to watch a good romantic comedy with Freddie Prinze Jr in it, rent She's All That. If you want to see Julia Stiles, rent 10 things I Hate About You. But don't waste your time or money on this movie."
2,quite dissapointing,With so many good acters in this film you would think this would be a good film.Its a rubbish love story.It had a few good songs and thats why i havwe giving this film 2 stars.This movie is not worth watching.
1,"if i could give it no stars, i would.","ok, i was reading the other reviews (most GOOD) and I was thinking :Are these people out of their minds! "" This is honestly the WORST movie I have ever seen! The story makes no sense, the acting is horrible, and it is dragged out for WAY too long of a time! I would not reccomend this to anyone, considering the funniest moment of this ""romantic-comedy"" as when someone told an 11-year old Julia Stiles she ""kissed like a fish"" and followed by throwing a basketball at her. This moie is just too ridiculous for words. If you don't believe me, attempt to watch it and find out for yourself!"
1,Don't See It!,"You can't say I don't like this movie because I'm to old to get it because I'm 17 and I still hated it. The characters and situations were so unrealistic and I was embarrassed for the actors that they had to deliver awful lines. I didn't connect with the two leads at all. I enjoyed Julia Stiles performance in 10 Things I Hate About You and I like Freddie Prinze Jr., so I thought I would like this movie but it was so dissappointing. Just trust me, don't see it."
1,Worst movie ever,"I suppose I could describe this movie as thought-provoking, because all my thoughts were permeated with this movie for days. It's just... so incredibly bad. Don't watch it. It just made me feel sick. It makes me feel sick now just thinking about it."
1,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"I wanted to see another movie with my friend but couldn't so i suggested this one. I had seen maybe one commercial and thought it might be good, but i didn't know anything about it. About halfway through i wanted to cry. Selma Blair, Henry Winkler and the 'Jim Morrison' guy were refreshing, but other than that, it was painful to watch. The plot would suddenly jump periods of time for no reason. Freddie Prinze was awful. There was absolutely no reason to care what happened. The story was extremely detached and I would have left in a second if i had a ride home. Please, never see this movie unless you have an escape route already mapped out."
1,"Ug, just read the review","Now first of all I like Freddie but the only problem is all the movies that he's in are romantic comedies. I find him to be a very talented actor and I would really like to see him branch out into other movies that don't scream ""teen flick!"" Now about the movie. The acting was good, and some of the jokes where funny but there's just ONE problem. There was no plot. It just tells about a guy and girl that like eachother and is trying to stay together. Nothing intresting actually happens during it. I almost feel asleep in my chair at the theater! If you feel some strange need to see this movie rent it, but don't say I didn't warn you about it."
2,It's Just another Freddie Flick,"This movie is not worth renting, buying, or seeing. It's just another teen Freddie Flick where guy meets girl and they fall in love. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because Freddie Prinze Jr. is in it. It's so similar to ""She's All That"" and all his other teen ""romance"" flicks it's not even funny."
2,Hello? Story?,"Nothing much to this movie, actually. Two people fall in love, then they break up. Yeah great. There's nothing much to say, because there isn't much going on. It's like a nice praised vase, only empty. Really futile time spending. I've rated this movie 2 stars because it's not all bad. The director / writer have put their thoughts into the actual presentation of the film, and it kinda reminds you of an Ally McBeal episode - a collection of associations, and memories, presented in a nice, attractive way. It's like a nice gift, where you open up a great wrapping and discover a pencil sharpener at the end."
3,dont know,"This movie was not so realistic as people say it was. I am a teenager and I have many friends and none of us act in that way. Producers have to stop doing teenage movies, I hate when one thing does so well and everybody has to copy off them. I mean how many movies have you seen Freddie Prinze Jr. in. It is kinda ridiculous. The movie literally made me fall asleep. However, I did awake and finish watching it. They did try to make a good movie but the only people that you see are freddie and julia really. It could have did better, but its ok. There was no laughter or drama, this movie was really about nothing"
2,Winkler was the good part,"If you must watch this film, watch it for Winkler, who gives an interesting preview of his future role in ""Arrested Development"". Watching this movie for ""Prinz"" and ""Stiles"" is counterproductive. Not only have the actors ""failed to make the best"" of the script, the script was written from the viewpoint of the super-rich Hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences. Thus, we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school, muse about becoming ""singer-songwriters"", and ""stop paying attention"" to their college plans. Much like the ""Friends"" genre that this movie shamelessly imitates, this is a ""time porn"" piece, where the characters have little else to do besides ""mature romantically"" and ""find themselves"". A movie for history's circular file."
2,Not very good,"Funny that most movies with Freddie Prinze, Jr. aren't very good. In this one, he plays college student Al, who falls in love with fellow student Imogen (yup, that really IS a name) alias Julia Stiles. Al definitely thinks that Imogen is the love of his life, but soon nothing is as happy as it used to be, especially when Imogen cheats on Al with a reincarnation of Jim Morrison (Ashton Kutcher). But...surprise, surprise...the movie still has a happy ending.""Down To You"" is not a desastrous movie, but it's really nothing that you'd like to see more than once. The story is old and shapeless, the jokes are not funny and the dialogues are flat and not very smart. The cast, however, doesn't make the movie any better. Julia Stiles was in better roles already, Freddie Prinze, Jr. is acting like a piece of wood and Ashton Kutcher's part is simply bad. Not to mention the supporting actors like Selma Blair and Zak Orth.Don't waste your time or money on that one. It's no good movie."
2,"VERY OLD STUFF, no new ideas","First, excuse my spelling: english is not my first laguage.Kent Sayre's book is a very, very, very basic introduction to""classic"" NLP change work. Very old stuff.All the exercises are the most common, and old-fashionedNLP drills. In this book you will found excersice like: ""Circle of Excellence"" (oh, no, not again!!!), ""Behaviour Generator"" (uffff...), kinestetic anchoring (old an useless ""push button"" anchoring, you'll not see anything abount Sliding Anchors in this book), ""Personal History Change"", and so on.My suggestion is: if you don't know ANYTHING about NLP,THEN the book is a good introduction and you maybe could get something of value from it.BUT, if you know the something about NLP... even the most basic stuff... Don't waste your money... you will not find anything new or improved.Instead, if you want a really POWERFULL way of remove all your shyness and hesitation, I recomend you buy the 3D Mind videos of Tom Vizzini."
4,Some gems but a lot of fluff to sift through,"Worth reading for the valuable advice, but I felt I had to do a lot of skim reading to get past the airy-fairy stuff.I found the first half of the book most useful, but then the author started talking about his 20 tricks, which were mostly NLP techniques (visualisation, imagination etc). IF NLP works for you, then this book could be even more powerful.Beware the book talks about confidence mostly from a social perspective. If you are looking for confidence in other areas of your life, this book may dissapoint."
1,"Decent suggestions, but poorly written!","I bought this book based on the great reviews by other readers, even going to the trouble to have it shipped to me internationally. I'm sure that it may actually have a profound impact on the lives of some, but I couldn't get through the first half.The style is as though the author were giving a long speech, tending to ramble in places and not effectively communicating the key points. There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the first half of the book, and the poor formatting makes it even more difficult to read.Overall, the book is poorly written and edited, hiding some of the author's ideas (many of which seem to be fairly good ones) and getting the reader stuck in woefully incorrect grammar, punctuation, and formatting.Disappointing to say the least."
3,"Not Bad, Could be better but it's a decent book","Unstoppable Confidence has some good points. 1-The author emphasizes that you have to do something to get confidence, you have to work at it. 2-The author gives examples of how confident people view situations, this is one of the best things about the book, knowing how confident people think it is the key to understanding how to view situations confidently yourself.I didn't care for the NLP exercises(swishing, mirroring, working with submodalities, etc.) For those that like NLP this will be a strength of the book. I like straight-forward commonsene approaches not ""secret"" magic methods. Nonetheless it is a good book, one of the best confidence books I have read. I think the Ultimate Confidence book would go in depth explaining how confident people view things and give numerous examples of how confident people handles situations. And this book wouldn't have any NEW AGE ""secret"" methods, just straight forward common sense."
3,Not sure about this book yet,I'm still in the middle of this book so I'm not sure how I feel about it. I bought it because I needed some confidence. The book seems kind of superficial but maybe that's okay. Maybe I just needed this book (in place of a coach which I can't afford right now) to cheer me on.The author makes it seem so simple...he was shy and one day decided to get some confidence and then he made lots of money and had lots of friends. Well I am open-minded so I will keep reading the book and trying his techniques.
2,Waste of time reading and money,"I read a few pages and put it away. Basically, there're many other good books related to this subject worth buying, but this one is definitely waste of money. It's not informative, same corny phrases repeat over and over and it's getting very boring."
4,Unstoppable Confidence Review,A way to increase confidence and adjust cripling beliefs. An excellent read for anyone who wants to put negative thinking aside.
3,So-so,"""Game Of Love""(29.10.1990 BMG Ariola CD 261 059) is not their best album, but it contains a few nice songs:Jenny, Come HomeChains Of LoveI Am Your BelieverP.S. Their best album was ""Heartbeat""(1986 Ariola CD 258 017)."
5,Excellent Job by Lincoln Electric,This book covers a wide variety of welding parameters and all you will need to learn the correct procedures of arc welding.It also goes in depth on the tensile strengths of metals and any pre/post heat needed to maintain the ductility of alloys.I strongly encourage the purchase.
3,For a select audience,"3.5 stars.Let's be very clear: AtOE is not for the general reader. It's a rather dry work geared for an academic audience. It presumes a certain level of knowledge about the times and the geography. (At least a few maps were included.) That being said, it's a useful resource; material on the Diodochi seems rather sparse. The first half of the book is a narrative of Antigonos's life while the second half deals with the manner of his administration. The two were obviously cobbled together and not conceived as a single project.Recommended (if you have a particular interest in the subject)."
3,It's a VERY good book about the therapeutic power of ki,"I've found this book easy to follow, which is not a common thing when talking about something not all have experienced before. A lots of illness may be cured following this book, but, mainly, you can live a better life using your own ki not only for yourself. The book explains well how to expand your ki and cure diseases without remaing without YOUR own ki, proposing a series of test (as usual in Tohei's books). I suggest all people interested in helping suffering people to buy this book and read it carefully as it's really good."
2,This is the best chocolate if you receive it fresh.,"I had a supplier come in to the office straight from the plane with a box of the most decadent chocolate I have ever tasted. I went online and to my surprise found that Amazon could supply me with some more. I was so excited to receive the package. It was a huge box with bubble wrap inside. I opened the simple plastic bag containing what I thought would be the tiny pieces of heaven in foil. I was so disappointed. I've try all the different flavors and none of them are tasty. They all taste like old chocolate. If you can you can find this chocolatier somewhere fresh don't think twice, don't bat an eye. You will find out what true greatness is, but from this supplier - buyer beware.psst- 2 stars because it's not Baratti's fault someone sent me old chocolate."
4,Is There a Book inside You?,This book contains easy to read and understand information for the new author. The ideas presented and suggestions given are valuable and stand the test of time. Well worth the time and cost. An excellent resource book for your library.
4,Really good book,"I actually regret not reading this book earlier. This would save me lots of time while fulfilling the maintenance planner responsibilities. I reccomend this handbook to all new planners and to managers preparing to turn their company's maintenance to proactive and predictive. Of course it has some minor faults, but still provides many useful information."
1,Don't order this book to Amazon,"I have order this product 2 months ago. Amazon never delivered it to me. As I was complaining, they delayed and delayed asking me to wait longer for the delivery. Now, they don't even answer to me anymore and the return delay is passed. So, I have no chance to read it one day!!!"
1,"Bad Company, Bad Parts","I have owned over 4 laptops now and the IBM thinkpad is by far the cheapest and most unreliable laptop. The computer has been unuseable every 4 months. First the battery. Then the power source. Then the harddrive. And now the motherboard, which by-the-way, has to be sent in to be replaced. It will take approximately 2 weeks to get all that back to me. I suggest a Mac or Toshiba. Their parts are not made in China, Mexico, and Malaysia like IBM-Lenovo's parts. I should have never taken the advice of PC magazine. THey do not rate on reliability."
2,Couldn't Hold My Interest,"I have yet to finish this book. I made it halfway through it, but I just lost interest. It was a little predictable, and it didn't make me want to know how it ended."
3,Early Rhythm & Blues from a small regional label out of Nashville,"An interesting sampler of an early Nashville based regional blues label in the post war era. The Big Three Trio here featured the prolific bluesman Willie Dixon, and it was in this trio he had his first successes as a bassist. Eventually his catalog included over 500 songs, and he was a recognized top producer, songwriter, bassist, and singer. When he went on to Chess Records in Chicago, his work with Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, Sugar Pie DeSanto and many others comprises what we now know as the Chicago Sound. Here's a rare peak at Willie in his younger days."
5,Mardi Gras: Holly Smoke!,"Hottest version of Mardi Gras I ever saw containing lots of flashing, nudity and parties. I'm planning my vacation to go to Bourbon Street and follow these guys around!"
5,Good Stuff,This product is wonderful and last a long time. I recommend it to anyone needing this type of product.
2,Small Print Is An Understatement,The pocket edition is fine if you carry a magnifying glass in your other pocket!
1,Just Okay,"Would not buy again, as I bought a pair at the grocery store that were 10 times better and cheaper. These just don't grip and flip meat very well. Think it has something to do with the scalloped ends."
5,Eye Opening experience,"The book Gift of the Whale is an eye opening view into the life of the Inupiat and the importance of the whale hunt to their life and traditions. The photos are awesome, and realistically show people involved in the struggle to survive in the harsh environment of northern Alaska. The narrative is interesting and informative."
3,Only works with the 750-ER,"My star rating is 3 since it seems like a nice product, however it only works with fans rated 120 V Max 5 Amps. Since I have the 2400 which is 13.8 A it won't work. The installation instructions are very complete and easy to understand. Just doesn't support my model."
2,terrible color,There are no pictures of the 'assorted colors' and the brown it came in is the ugliest 1970's nasty brown carpet.I have another of these in cream which our cats love. I wanted to add another one to my office. I don't know where else to look for a cream colored one. I called some local stores that Lazy Pet website listed as a retailer and they all had the same scary larry brown too.
5,Cats LOVE it!,"My husband and I moved into a new home a few months ago. The windowsills are very small, which doesn't allow for our 2 cats to sit on them and look out the window, which makes me sad!My husband and I purchased this from Petsmart last night, on sale for the same price here. We brought it home, it was VERY easy to install, and our cats took to it immediately! When I woke up this morning, Sophie was still there! Best money I have ever spent on my cats :)"
4,Perfect - not the color I ordered though,"The perch is perfect. The cat LOVES it. It came in dark brown for some reason, but I was really please with its sturdiness and dark brown magically matches!"
4,"Easy, tool-less assembly. Works well.","Bought one of these at a local pet mart. Paid retail, and though it certainly is not $30 worth of product, it is a good solution. Bed has a plywood base, the brackets are rubber-coated metal, and the thick foam padding and a terry cover give it a solid and substantial feel and look compared to other models with all-plastic frames... Cats have not seen it yet (they're sleeping downstairs) but I expect they will enjoy the view from a cozy perch..."
2,Needs more product info!,"The perch itself is nice. However, the support bars had to bent a little to fit flush against the wall (the perch was leaning!). My biggest complaint is that the product description failed to mention that the perch mounts to the windowsill via a velcro strip, which has an adhesive strip that is applied directly to the windowsill! No thanks! I found some large curtain brackets at a local hardware store and mounted them on the bottom of the perch so I could hang it from the windowsill. Also, by doing so, I can move the perch to another window!"
3,Sturdy construction but keeps falling down.,"I have narrow window sills in my apartment and while one of my cats can sit in them to look out, the other with a slight larger *ahem* ""behind"" doesn't fit. I needed a window seat that didn't require me screwing anything in so I purchased one of these. It's very sturdy construction and I felt confident that it wouldn't break under the weight of my larger car. Unfortunately, because my windows sills are so narrow the support legs do not reach the wall and the velcro isn't strong enough to hold it up. I tried placing a book between the legs and the wall but that didn't work either. Sadly, it's been relegated to the storage closet.On a positive note, the feather toy that it came with is one of my cat's favorite toy. She has demolished it (it literally has 1 feather left in it and she still carries it around everywhere) and I cannot find this same toy anywhere else. I may have to purchase a whole seat just to get the toy again!"
2,was o.k.,The perch stayed attached to my window sill for about 5 minutes with my cat laying on it and then there was a crash. the tape holding the velcro bits to the sill did not work very well. I will try it again with some new tape. would not recommend.
2,Review of cat perch,"The seller was wonderful to deal with. The picture showed a light cover, but I received a dark brown one and I don't remember there ever being a choice. The seller was helpful and told me I could return it. I decided to give it a try and that was actually a mistake.It doesn't secure very well so if my cats jump on it it moves down.I prefer the kind that come with a screw that can be screwed in, this one only has velcro."
2,needs work,"doesn't fit right on all windows and if your cat is heavy the velcro won't hold, but theres not much out there"
3,Top sticks to windowsill with tape,I bought this window perch for my kitties. Product said it was suitable for up to 25 pounds which was perfect. No tools needed. I figured there would be a clamp on the top piece to secure it to the window sill only to find that there was strong tape with velcro that needed to be attached to my windowsill. Not what I had in mind. Didn't want to destroy my windowsill and didn't trust that this would stay in place with just tape and velcro with my heavy and active cats. I returned the product for a refund.
2,Adhesive is subpar,"Having read a number of reviews that said to follow the instructions around the adhesive carefully, I conservatively gave the adhesive 24 hours to set before letting my cats on it. However, the perch fell off the window sill in less than a week. I ended up using shelving brackets to attach it to the wall, so the cats can still use it, but for that I might as well have gone with a perch that attaches to the wall in the first place.One note - the sill I attached the perch to was marble, not wood. It may be the case that it would attach just fine to a wooden sill, but it certainly doesn't do very well on stone."
5,cat napper,My cats love this bed. It is easy to install. no nails. great produce. I would recommend this to anyone with cats.
4,One cat likes it,"This cat perch works very well so far because it is sturdy and doesn't move around when the cat is climbing onto it. Easily installed. No marks are left on the wall. One cat (a 26-pounder) loves it but the other is not interested. One problem I foresee is when I need to move the perch, I will have to replace the adhesive which may not be as strong as the original."
3,more details please,"The perch works great, except for one thing...I don't recall it ever mentioning how deep your window sill needs to be. We have narrow window sills (with those stupid crank windows) and we had to modify the product...with a saw...to get it to work for us. The sticky tape was in an inch or more from the edge of the perch, which meant it wasn't on the sill at all for us. We had to trim the board and notch it for the central post divide between the vertical panes on these crank out windows."
1,Lazy Pet kitty window perch,"The concept here is good ""no tools needed"" to install. The product itself is well made, but the velcro tape does not adhere to the windowsil like it is suppose to, the perch keeps falling down and the cats are afraid to use it. If there were clips or screws on the perch it would be much better.I prefer the cheaper window perches because even though they are not plush they do the job and do NOT fall down."
3,frrustrating,"My poor car--she loves this when it's up, but it keeps falling off. It also made marks on my wall. I may not have allowed it to sit long enough before my cat sat on it, so it may be my fault, but it's still pretty frustrating. Warning: follow instructions EXACTLY."
2,Glacier's Perch,My cat really doesn't like it He prefers the hammock style. The reviews lead me to think it would be large enough for my cat He is a Maine Coone.
2,not as pleased as I had hoped,The sticky side of the velcrow did not stay on my wooden windowsill. It fell down even when my cat (10 lbs.) wasn't on it. My cat loved it while it lasted... Wish the adhesive was better.
2,not for heavy cats,"My cat loved this perch as soon as we installed. However, my cat is a 14 pound Maine Coon and is probably bigger than your average cat. After about three months of use we came home to find the window perch on the floor. Over time my big kitty manage to bend the supports. So don't buy this one if you also have a larger type of cat."
1,Not safe for cats,"I purchased this a few months ago and it stays on the window for a while and then falls off unexpectedly. The velcro sticks to itself on the seat, but pulls away from the sill because the adhesive is not strong enough."
3,Cat Perch,"We just brought a 6 yr. old male cat home who weighs about 6-8lbs. I ordered the cat perch about 2 weeks later because I really didn't want him sitting on the back of my leather couch. The perch was easy to install. It took a few hours for the cat to 'take' to it. The covered pad did seem to catch some of the hair that was shed. Another plus, you can remove the cover and toss it in the washer/dryer. He loved it for weeks--until it fell down. I am now left with trying to reattach it without putting holes in my walls. I know as soon as I figure this out the perch will, again, be his favorite seat in the house."
2,"Important Issue, Badly Written","Breton and Villegas make the case that Latin ballplayers are exploited and then, in the overwhelming majority of cases, tossed away by major league teams. Miguel Tejada was one of those who, it turned out, wasn't just cheap filler for an organization's minor league chain, but instead broke through to the majors. This surprised the A's organization which originally ranked him below other Dominicans who have since faded and returned to island obscurity or the life of an undocumented alien in New York City. Unfortunately, the author's case is buried by some truly stilted prose in a narrative that wanders all over the map without giving Tejada himself much more life in the book than as a paradigm for the author's argument. I happen to know already a fair amount about Latin ballplayers so this book brought me neither increased insight into them as a group or to Tejada as an individual."
1,Product not arrived,Have been waiting for this item for well over a month and it has not yet arrived.
4,"Movie lovers, You're not alone!","When I first found this treasure in 1982, my first thought was ""I'm not alone!"" Of the 100 movies Danny Peary chose for his work, many were my own personal favorites. Mr. Peary clearly loves film, but he loves movies even more. By that I mean his reviews reflect someone who sits in a dark theater or a comfortable chair and just enjoys what he is watching, without overanalyzing them. That is why this book is so enjoyable."
5,For the film fanatic,"From a source that was never revealed I wound up with Mr. Peary's cult movies 2 book as a kid. I read it with great enthusiasm and wound up checking out quite a few movies because of it. The noteworthy ones were A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver. After years of looking in the back and seeing the list for the first Cult Movies book, I could stand it no longer. I finally ended up with the book and it is a true treat. Recommended to not read about the films that you have not seen. For those you have this serves as a background check, a detailed analysis and a clarifier. If for nothing else one can appreciate the plot synopsis, cast and credits, and production stills. For the fans of such ""classics"" as 2001, Forty Second Street, the Searchers, and many others, this is the book for you."
2,Not Very Useful,"This does not tell me much that I did not already know. Lack of illustrations make for dry reading, even about this great city. Frommer's, Eyewitness, and National Geographic are a lot better."
2,unrealized potential,"I really wanted to like this book more than I did. But, the hero is a rogue of the worst kind for some time, the heroine is both too good to be true and too naive, historical innacuracies pull the reader out of the story, and King's style can become too sentimental and repetitious.King's style tries to be reminiscent of Jane Austen, but often feels forced and sounds trite. Plot elements often fail to become fully realized, especially as to their effects. A smile and a smoothly delivered line cannot end all potential scandal. King does, however, have a good handle on the seesaw type of relationship that permeates romance books. The too pat, but still entertaining fates of the heroine's sisters are also noteworthy. The villain was adroitly handled, and this heroine is one who can certainly stand on her own.Great potential in this book; I just wish it had been executed with greater care. Enjoyable, but hardly exceptional."
1,Thought I found treasure...ended up trash,"I was very excited to find this book, in perfect condition, at a garage sale for $1.00!!! What a treasure! I was more thrilled to see the recipe for the Banana Cream pie that my husband and I had at his restaurant in New Orleans. I decided to make it for a special occassion. I knew something was wrong when it said to mix 3/4 c. corn starch with 1 cup cream. I stopped there and looked up the recipe on-line. I found other mistakes but it was to late...we are having banana soup on mushy crust for my husband's 45th birthday today. This wasn't the first recipe errors I've found in this book, but the most expensive. (Price vanilla bean right now and you'll see what I mean.) Now I understand why this 'treasure' was put out for 'trash'. Quantities are wrong and important directions are omitted. What a waste!"
1,Overrated,"This is way overrated. As Mr. Peabrain below proves, there are just some people who can't tolerate any criticism of their clown-prince Emeril. How typical of him to label all who dissent as 'dumb'. Emeril is not GOD. His food, while innovative, is mainly an exercise in ingredient overkill. Most chefs will try to use the right balance of ingredients to enhance the flavor just right. Instead, Emeril's motto seems to be more, more, and lots of it! Simple dishes end up being complex piles of things that just don't go together. Just once, I'd like to see Emeril make something as simple as a peanut butter sandwich without turning it into a heaping pile of glop."
1,A total waste of money and ingredients,"This is the most overrated trash ever compiled into a 'cookbook'. Emeril wouldn't know what to do with an honest, simple menu. His cult like status has warped his ignorant mind to the point that he can't make one dish without overdoing the spices and performing his cartoonish buffon act. The people of New Orleans ought to send him packing back to Boston. He is an embarassment to the whole notion of Louisiana cooking."
2,Big Disappointment !,"I bought this book for a young chef wannabe, a Christmas present. And what to my wondering eyes did appear but a book with no food pictures. The only pics here are black and white shots of street signs, bags of grain and other such useless objects. They aren't even worthy of New Orleans tourist memorabilia. Good old Emeril in true form is chasing the dollar. I think he should hang his head in shame for presenting this book and especially at this price."
5,"Emeril, you've made me HAPPY HAPPY","Evenings aren't complete without watching Emeril Live on the food network. It doesn't matter if he's cooking Cajun or a pork roast, Emeril has got it, and so does this cookbook. His seafood is devine, along with his pasta, salads, and beef. You will be guaranteed to have happy guests. Just hide the scale because I can guarantee you won't be able to stop at just one helping."
3,Not an Emeril fan,Thanks to the person who mentioned Chef Prodhomme's book as being the best basic Louisiana cookbook.I qualify my comments because I am experimenting with Louisiana cooking for someone who likes the cajun flavors.
1,Louisiana cooking,"Emeril does not know about Louisiana cooking. He has ridden the coattails of true masters like Prudhomme and Folse. His greatest claim to fame is his irritating 'BAM!'. In this book, Emeril took a collection of recipes from a friend of his, then slapped his name on the cover. Besides, these recipes are nothing great or special. If you want true Louisiana cooking, go find a book from somebody who knows what they are talking about."
1,"Hasselhoff before he was anybody ( example of a ""C"" movie )","An amazing tale about a morality crisis at Aloha High School. Preggie cheerleaders,lovelorn but obese school nurse,drugs,booze and Gruber from TVs ""McHale's Navy"" as your chef-principal. Highlights: Hasselhoff ""Hi protien breath"" Generic teacher ""The magic word SHORTHAND can mean the difference between a low paying job and a medium paying job."" The dance scene in the malt shop with Hasselhoff is also precious. Actually ranks as one of those films that is soooo bad it's funny. Incidentally it's NOT starring David Hasselhoff; It's ""FEATURING"" David Hasselhoff as ""B*NER!""One I'm sure that would crack up the gang at Baywatch."
5,All you need for free flowing elite gaming..best game WW has,"Mage is a great book in that it can be as simple and as complex as you want, with the typical WW anarchy when it comes to a storyteller following the writen rules...a much more plausible system of magic than the T$R crap with rules only to handicap with hardly a good explanation...And the magick system is much more plausible than the RIFTS system, which parallels T$R slightly but gives more explanations and better spells....This is the perfect game for elite players because it gives so much individual play into what the player wants magick to be for their character...Definitely a little too complex to be someone's first game without a satey net of good players though, but that's hardly a bad point...Put simply, White Wolf's World of Darkness is the best multiverse RP system, and Mage is the best part of it..."
5,Magick at its best,"I've been playing RPGs now for 10 years and havent found something as good as this book. In my personal opinion the magic system is the best system there is and the stories you can come up with are unlimited. Besides, why play with a Vampire when you can create and manipulate reality at your wish."
4,A great role playing system,White wolf has once again incorporated there d10 system into another role-playing game this book may not be as good as Vampire: the Masquerade but beats out all other White Wolf RPG's
5,The best game in the World of Darkness,"This is the best game in White Wolf's game universe. I have never played a game with so many possibilities. This book is the core rulebook for Mage the Ascension Second Edition. The book contains everything you need to understand the Mage universe. Every aspect of the game is elaborated on fully or contains enough information for you to come up with the rest of the details. The book focuses on the Traditions but there is also a good amount of information on the Technocratic Union, Marauders, and Nephandi for you to use. The worlds beyond the Gauntlet and Horizon are also touched on along with sample umbrood. With this book any game is possible. You want to play a fireball-chucking mage? No problem. How about a hacker from the Matrix? There's a Tradition available just for that. Want to play a tough martial artist who can catch bullets? There are rules for that too. This is a great book that can stand alone without supplements, unlike its revised edition."
4,Great role-playing that requires you to think.,"The worst part about the book is design. It's often difficult to look things up. Other than that, Mage is a wonderful role-playing world which requires thought and imagination. Anyone who thinks that mages are weak is kidding himself. Sure, if you go toe-to-toe against a Black Spiral Dancer with a beginning character, you're toast. The trick is to use your brain so you can anticipate, avoid, or escape the situation using your magickal abilities, which are insanely powerful in the Mage world. Only munchkins don't like Mage. You know who you are."
5,A MUST for any professional in the service industry.,"Mr. Maister has written the ""the bible"" for the service industry. His concepts and views are on the money. True Professionalism is not a quick fix or trend, but a collection of timeless business advice.This book is a must for any consultant and/or business leader in the service industry."
3,Excellent Book - Speaks directly to consultants,"Finally a book that speaks to the heart of what consulting is(or professional services in general), with no hype, no distractions or flavor-of-the-month thoughts. I had heard David Maister at a recent consulting conference and was quite struck by his focus on people and 'execution of strategies' as being the core of successful consulting firms.This book is pithy without being trite and if you have been in consulting a while, you can directly relate to what the author is referring to. There are many suggestions in this book that are insightful, practical and feel right on the money to a practictioner.While by no means a classic, it is certainly a must read."
4,Insightful!,"David H. Maister has written a valuable book about what it really means to be a professional. Presented with depth, insight and plenty of practical advice, the book is intelligently written and can be applied to anyone's career, no matter the level or industry. Maister also has plenty to say to companies about their professionalism and lack of it. We [...] recommend this book to professionals in all areas, and if you want to be a better one - or if you're not sure whether you are one or not - start reading."
3,Good final section,"Mr. Maister's True Professionalism is a pretty good description of ""professional"" behavior. Part One is (Mostly) About You""---I found this section more fluff than anything; but in Part Three (Mostly) About Your Clients, Maister offers good advice and counsel for dealing with existing clients and expanding one's presence. In particular, his chapter on ""What Clients Want"" was worth the price of the book. In this chapter, Maister walks the reader through the logic of determining ""what"" your clients ""value"" and how to expand customer satisfaction (hint: do more of what your client value). I have Maister's The Trusted Advisor (have never read the whole book, just parts) and Strategy and The Fat Smoker (which I've read, but haven't reviewed---it is very good, btw)--True Professionalism is a must read for a consultant (also read everything written by Alan Weiss) and will help the novice avoid common mistakes. Recommended."
3,A Psychological Approach,"Since Phillips is a practicing psychologist, this book reflects his background by concentrating on the emotional aspects of living with an ostomy - specifically issues of fear, depression, anger, etc. Phillips does acknowledge that these are issues more likely to be experienced by individuals who have suddenly underwent surgery due to a diagnosis of cancer or a sudden complication of IBD like toxic megacolon. Individuals with IBD consciously choosing the surgery often have a more positive attitude and suffer fewer emotional downswings because of the overall improvement in their post-surgery life. Phillips includes the usual chapters related to family members and their coping issues, which is very helpful, but the overall lack of first person accounts, and the slightly outdated information make The Ostomy Book the preferred book on this topic. Still, this volume would be useful if the new ostomate or a family member is having difficulty adjusting."
1,Poor quality.,"This tool is not strong enough to bend the spark plug wire. You will also need pliers to get the job done. Plus, the tool is oily when received. Should have been made of stainless steel."
1,Why is Brian Steel still selling this book?,"Brian Steel is still selling this book despite his disaffection with Sathya Sai Baba since 2000. Unlike other authors who have pulled their books after their disaffection, Brian Steel continues to try to make money off of Sathya Sai Baba by selling a book whose contents he no longer advocates for or believes in! Consequently, who can recommend a book from a former devotee (turned Anti-Sai Activist) who now has nothing good to say about Sathya Sai Baba?"
3,Works extremely well,"I love this liquid! I never have to worry about stains as this gets practically everything out without even requiring a pre-wash. With two busy kids and a husband who fixes things a lot, I find this very helpful in keeping up with the laundry.The only complaint I have is that the correct amount marker is nearly hidden halfway up the cap. If you don't look carefully, you will use too much detergent. I did this and my front-loader's bearings wore out after only 3 years. The cause - using too much detergent. So this was a very costly error on my part, and it was not very nice of the manufacturer to conceal the proper amount to use. This is why I rate it at only 3 starts even though it works very well for cleaning clothes, when used in the proper amount."
3,"All is great, shipping drips","All Small and Mighty is great. My problem is that 2 of the 9 bottles arrived from Amazon with cracked caps, so the box was a slippery, soggy mess. Others had the caps leak, so overall I think I will just buy All at the store."
4,Seems to work well...,"No problems. Like the small format bottle, easy to store. Works as well as anything else."
2,"Random, Vague, and Unfunny","My partner gave me this for my birthday last week, and since I can't tell him what I thought about it, here goes: It [stunk]! I mean, if you've been spoiled all your life and never had to do anything (like clean up your place in a hurry) the book may be for you. But overall, I found the author's tone to be irritating, and her directions incomplete (i.e. the wine ordering section simply tells you to order in the middle of the price sheet --- that's it?). To be sure, there were a few chapters that were intriguing: starting various fires, parallel parking; but the overwhelming majority of the book is filled with Adcock's yuppie instructions on what SHE thinks everyone should know."
5,Most Informative for a self-described loaf,"I really enjoyed this book. I had no idea to fold a fitted sheet or whistle loudly. I especially like the more adult topics- choosing wine, furniture, baby- holding. Very informative and helpful. And I loved the cartoons."
4,Great for little ones; annoying for adults!,"My two-year-old niece ADORES this DVD - she would watch it fifty times a day if her mother would let her. Like another reviewer's little one, she is already saying her ABCs (yes, all the way through) because of this video - seriously impressive! The bits about the animals are cute and educational, too.. I also didn't like the Barney that was on TV when I was a kid, but this particular ""movie"" is much more educational than the older TV episodes. The reason I took off one star is because the songs can get very annoying if you are an adult who has to listen to this all day... *And you will not be able to get them out of your head*. At least they're catchy, I suppose. :)"
5,Wonderful,My 3 year old daughter absolutely love this Barney. I love it because she learning her ABC's and having fun with all the animals. She loves this video more than the Barney at the Zoo. I highly recommend for any one who has a child that loves Barney. Great songs.
2,Animal Songs But Not Many Animals,Despite the name and cover there were disappointingly few real animals in this video. Mostly this is just recycled song clips about make-believe animals from the PBS Barney & Friends TV show. As such it's no better and no worse than any of the free episodes on TV.
1,Very Remedial Pamphlet,"Using a small font this pamphlet could be paraphrased in this amount of space. Definitely not what I had in mind. Did not include enough developed information, lacked substantive information."
5,This book was Awesome!!!!!!!,When nancy and frank bump into each other at a hotel Frank tells nancy about there case and nancy wants in on it.. but when nancy finds a dead body she has a case of her own.....until they realize there cases are connected.....this is a really action packed book....then frank and george get kidnapped...and then joe hears frank drowned....well its awesome..a lot of mystery if you have a limit on how much you are allowed to buy I recommend this one...
2,Maybe you have to have read the previous books...,"Pediatrician Sara Linton pays a visit to her ex-husband, the police chief, the same day two violent young men decide to storm the police station and gun down the occupants.Now that is bad luck.Author Karin Slaughter mixes this action with flashbacks from a previous age, when Sara Linton was being courted by Chief Jeffrey Tolliver. During this bizarre courtship, there is a murder, another decade old murder revealed, lies, anger, drunkenness, less than passionate sex, and more. Yet Sara stands by her man!This weaving of past and present just did not work, even though there was a strained connection between past and present.I had no understanding, at all, about how these two people found anything in common. And that was my primary problem with this story. Some majority of any plot has to make sense. This one didn't.I'm not looking forward to any other book in this series, and with these characters."
3,Day of Wrath is prophetic,"Day of Wrath by William J. Coughlin, the late federal judge ofDetroit is one of his better & more exciting novels. The plot isgritty, and the characters tend to be quite macho. To some degree, many of the characters tend to be stereotypical.Ace, the assistant prosecutor is a wonderful character, well portrayed. The denouement at the end of the novel works well to reveal why Ace behaves & feels the way he does. The nitty gritty of court room life, the way judges behave, their backgrounds & attitudes are very revealing as well. I'm inclined to take Mr. Coughlin's word for the inner world of judgeship, since he himself is a judge.Recommended for those who like lawyer mysteries, those who like the grittier side of life/fiction, and for those who enjoy seeing the duel between terrorists and the rest of the world."
1,Wannabe porn stars try to make a horror film!,"We watched maybe 5 minutes of this movie. In the first five minutes we learned that the acting was atrocious, the audio was horrible. In the first five minutes we see two teenagers wanting to 'role play' (meaning have sex) in this mental hospital. After bearing her chest (needless in a horror film) to the guy, she sees a man with an ax. Her guy takes off after after him telling her to ""shut the blank up, there's someone down there"". She tells him ""fine, see if they've got a condom"". (Wasn't this supposed to be a horror flick?? I'm confused...lol) Immediately after the guy takes a really pathetic ax whack to the head. Then we turned it off. It's laughable, but I wouldn't waste a couple hours trying to watch it."
1,Really?,"I picked this little gem up at the video store and within a few minutes I wasn't sure if I had accidentally gotten a really bad soft core adult film or if some kids replaced the real movie with their own made for youtube or senior class video project on their spring break using their mom's minivan and their techie cousin's video recorder.It was worse than Mariah Carey's ""Glitter""."
2,Too Dancey,"I enjoyed Cathe's basic step DVD so I brought this, thinking it was gonna be similar. Well the jokes on me, it was dancey and too complicated to be enjoyable. Her cuing was way off and her blasts were jokes. I wish I could return it."
2,Cathe Friedrich's Low Max DVD (DVD),I bought this video thinking I was going to get a good workout. My heart rate did go higher but that was just because I was trying to keep up with Cathe. The workout has to many steps to try to keep up with. By the time you get one step down she adds another and I would fall behind again. Even if I watched it all the way through I wouldn't be able follow along. I wanted basic steps to work on certain areas not the stumbling along I do with this dvd.
2,Not That Different,"Watched once and then forgot about this DVD. I am realizing i need the stimulation from in person workouts with people or a trainer in order to get the results I want. DVDs are all about self motivation, which I need more of.I donated to local charity shop along with other items recently. I think the future is all digital."
3,Ridiculously Complicated Choreography,"If I live to step to 100, I will never understand the concept of turning one's back on the step. They have a nasty habit of moving around by themselves while you are not watching. Boo! Back when I used to attend step classes in the gym, this is the kind of workout that sent women tumbling to the ground. I would have walked out of this class. Cathe gets three stars for the customizable options on this dvd and for the fact that I did get a good sweat."
2,More complex moves than I expected,"I was hoping for a good basic step DVD. The routines were not broken down well so it was a struggle to keep up or to even figure out how to do some of the moves, particularly those that put you over the step with your back to the TV. I haven't tried it again since but probably will some day. I'll take Gin Miller any day over this one though."
1,too complicated,"I work out on an 8 inch step, and I like the simple moves, like lunges and knee lifts and running and jumping, but if I wanted to mamba and cha cha and tippy toe around, I wouldn't be doing it on a step. I like physically intense exercise, not mentally intense. If you like dancey, this is for you."
4,A must read,"Even if you agree or disagree with the Elliott wave theory, it cannot be denied the increadible wealth of knowledge of history, markets, economy and social trends that Mr. Prechter has. For this reason alone one should read his work. Not for trading (or if you do, use his recommendations with a genuine trend following filter for the big calls like a multi-month breakout signal) but to open the mind on how forces can affect the stock markets. In my professional life I met only another major technical analyst with even a superior knowledge of the markets and that was Mr. Ian Notley. Charts must make sense and that is only possible when one overlaps them with macro indicators, cycles and yes, long-term elliott waves. Can I recommend also to look at the Kondratieff wave theory updated work by the ""Long Wave Analyst""?"
5,"I love it, keeps you on edge!",I love IRT! I watch them over and over again! Great show! Hope to see more! I can't wait for more seasons!
3,No blu-ray for season 5?,Looks like yet another tv show that released a few seasons on blu-ray and then went back to dvd only. I love the show and will probably buy this on dvd but I just hate when 1 or 2 seasons are released in a superior format and then we are forced to go back and buy later seasons again just on dvd. Hopefully they will still decide to put this season along with Deadliest Roads season two on blu-ray but it's not looking like it.
4,"If you like IRT, this is a pretty good season","If you are someone who has liked past seasons of IRT, then this one should fall right in line with what you have come to know and like. It was pretty predictable what was going to happen at times, but I guess there isn't much originality you can plug in to a show like this. There were some good times with the camera crews and once Hugh even teared up. I was pretty happy with this season as a regular viewer."
4,perfect,What a great reference book to have on your shelf. I think it is exactly what I needed to have.
