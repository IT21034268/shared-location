5,Even better on blu,"Great movie, even better on blu!Sounds great, looks amazing...makes the suspense even tighter! So happy when my expectations are exceeded."
3,DVD Review,"Despite being the best transfer of this film, the picture is still very grainy at times. Sound is not very good and Special Features are lacking too. There is no director's commentary and only a short collection of scenes w/o audio misleadingly dubbed ""Behind the scenes"". An old interview with Cameron is included, however it's still no substitue for a full-length commentary. Not to mention the crappy case. This movie deserves better. At [price] this DVD is seriously overpriced....This is what ""Aliens - Collector's Edition"" should contain:- New anamorphic transfer.- DTS soundtrack- Commentary by James Cameron, Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton.- ""Making of"" documentary"
4,Scary and Slimy!,"This movie maybe old, but it was really scary! Soldiers were in a place where there was many aliens and had to fight all of them. But how do the aliens kill? All I know, is that they do use their second mouth. The queen was huge and it ripped one guy in half around the ending. Good to watch. The aliens were kinda creepy looking too. But we don't get to see how the little girl's mom and brother got killed."
5,the exter 15 mins of the flim,I haven't seen Aliens special edition be for but my freinds all say that is a good flim to buy but I want to why has it not been on television becouse Iwas wundering. Becouse the T1000 edition was the special edition of Turmiator
1,Item did not work properly,"Unfortunately, the item did not play properly. Continuously froze. I did not return; Item was less than $5 and not worth the hassle of re-packaging and paying shipping to send back."
5,The Best Futuristic Military Film Ever Made,"The Scott film was good, especially at the end. But this one, it captures the fear and intensity of close quarters combat like nothing else. Perhaps it takes Giger's creatures to actually reach the jaded audience, but this one does it. The very premise of the beings just makes it sickeningly scary. The production and casting are still benchmarks, though some of the green screen footage of the drop ship in the reactor complex now needs to be CGI touched up. I will disagree with most of you on one point, though. The additional footage is not necessary. In fact, I think the scene with Newt's parents actually harms the narrative flow and suspense by giving too much away. The first ""Director's Cut"" version was the best, in my opinion."
5,A sequel that surpasses the original!,"I enjoyed the first ALIEN movie, but not on as many levels as I enjoyed the sequel.Apart from the further development of Ripley's character, we got to learn more about the aliens themselves, and their insect mentalities, which was executed beautifully with the inclusion of a very convincing 'queen' alien."
5,A Sadly Rare Type of Movie,"I believe there may be some sort of law against not having seen this movie. For your own sake, I would suggest watching it immediately, just in case.Aliens is a rare breed of movie -- lots of action, great characters, a menacing enemy, all pulled off extremely well. While Starship Troopers watered itself down with some obviously irrelevant romance scenes, We Were Soldiers goes through pains to show you the effect of a war at home and so many other action movies focus on just one cheesy lead character, Aliens is like a good old fashioned war movie. There's marines with machine guns (and plenty of personality), there's lots of vicious, nasty aliens, there's award winning special effects, what more could you want?Aliens is the perfect example of action sci-fi done right. It pains me that there are really no other movies up to spec in this catagory."
5,One of the best sci-fi films ever,To this day I can't remember a movie that had me sitting on the edge of my seat. I can still recall the first time I saw this film in the theater and I think I left fingernail impressions in the armrest. The special edition DVD does not disappoint. I enjoyed the extra footage and other extras. This is a movie that can be enjoyed over and over again. I put this movie behind the first two Star Wars movies as the best sci-fi films ever.
4,An Excellent Follow-Up,"James Cameron directs an excellent follow-up to Ridley Scott's monster hit. ""Aliens"" is a suspenseful, action-packed gore fest that had garnered a well deserved 7 Academy Award nominations, including a Best Actress nod to Sigourney Weaver. While the film does have a slim plot, Cameron makes up for it in every other possible way. Weaver is excellent as Ripley, but the visual effects steal the show."
3,Why they have film editors,"Simply said, this was a great film without the extra 17 mins. They PAY film editors because they are experts in creating flow and consistency in a film. When a director comes back and adds 17 mins to create a special edition, with only a few exceptions, he creates a work which is FAR INFERIOR to the original. The 17 extra mins added to this film are aboslute film killers. They destroy the flow of the film in general, and a few sceens with only one or two simple lines added turn a dramatic PUNCH onto a wet noodle. I was incredibly disappointed, where can I get a DVD version of the ORIGINAL theactrical release?"
4,Exactly how it should be on DVD,"Aliens on DVD is very good. For you fans of science fiction, this is what you've been waiting for. The sound and musical score is absolutely amazing and the picture quality is what I had hoped for. If you're looking for a good science ficton or action film and are usually disappointed by the quality of DVD's, get this film. You will disappointed with neither."
4,NOT the best of the series,"Contrary to just about everyone I know I think Aliens is the worst of the four. Although the Director's cut fleshes out some much needed detail it is inferiour in photography and style to the other three. It's popularity can only be explained when you realise it's the most American of the series. Pace and violence replace beautiful photography, story telling by exposee and pictures. James Cameron is a maker of expensive enjoyable B movies. Alien and Alien 3 were made by ex-commercial filmers (who are visually oriented) and 4 was made by half of a french team which made superb visual films. It shows."
4,Maybe better than the first one!,"I thought this was a great sequal to Alien; Aliens picked right up where the other left off. The action starts right away in Ripley's nightmare sequence. This movie is definately action-packed but I didn't find it TOO gory. One improvement from the first movie was the slight change in the appearance of the aliens.. Rather than a tall skinny man jumping around in a costume, these ""zenomorphs"" were made to look more like insects. Much scarier. I loved being introduced to the new alien creature towards the end of the film. I definately recommend this movie if you're in the mood for a great horror movie or an action video. Good story line, nice effects, lots of surprises. But by the way, did anyone else notice that when it shows the Marine space ship floating in space it looks exactly like a gun (it even had a trigger at the bottom). Oh well, no matter. It's still a good one. Watch it!"
5,An excellent combination of action and Sci-fi,"""Aliens"" sucessfully combines action and sci-fi to create one of the best films for both genres. I was impressed with the action and the story, action films seldomly have a story. James Cameron does an extrordinary job of maintaining the tension, once the movie gets going it doesn't let up. Sigourney Weaver gives a tough, convincing performance as Ellen Ripley. This film is without a doubt the best film in the ""Alien"" series and one of the best Sci-fi/Action movies around."
4,Great movie.,"It may not be the first one but it is a very good sequil anyway. ( Make that only good sequil) Since the alien movies become even more horrible and less scary, they make this movie look like a classic. The only thing wrong with this movie is that the marines make it seem boring. But buy it anyway."
2,not scary like the first one,"They were shooting and killing the aliens like flies in this movie and thats not scary.What made the first one so scary was you couldn't kill it it almost seemed invinsible.In this sequel they are killing aliens left and right with simple guns whats scary about that?I'm one of the few who found this movie a huge disappointment.I also don't understand why they waited so long to make a sequel since the first one was such a huge hit.It probably had to do with the person in charge of 20th century fox quiting.The new person in charge didn't like alien i heard and didn't want to do a sequel.I haven't seen one james cameron film that is good,that includes terminator 2 and titanic.Wish they could have kept ridley scott for the sequel."
2,Take me to your failure,"This movie is trash compared to the original Alien, which is beautiful. Aliens (2) is full of cliche stereotypical James Cameron mainstream storytelling. It tries to turn a horror movie into a family movie, with goofy dialogue (though some of it is humorous), a prominent ""poor and innocent yet optimistic and brilliant"" child role which is really annoying, another cliche annoying ""I'm stuck up and will do anything for money"" character, a cliche ""Hero"" character, and crazy meaningless numb violence. The only good things about it is Bill Paxton is fun to watch and there are a few neat special effects. Do yourself a favor and watch the original Alien, again if you have to."
1,A great movie ruined by extra footage,"This is a great movie, but the twenty minutes of extra footage is ridiculous. Yes, as a fan, I was curious to see the extra footage. But no, as a fan, I do not want to have to watch it again. The new scenes are sometimes long, sometimes boring, but mostly just annoying. Other DVDs, such as Austin Powers, provide cut scenes as bonus materials on the DVD menu. This is a nice feature. The same should have been done with Aliens. If you have three hours to spare and are a loyal fan, buy this DVD. Otherwise, wait until they (hopefully) will release the original version."
2,Zoned dvd's,I recently purchased this dvd and had it shipped to New Zealand the zone warning came up but i took a gamble anyway. It works perfectly so with this dvd there is no need not to buy it if you think your dvd player wont play it. Great movie too.
1,bad disc,recieved item damaged. tried playing on 3 different blu-ray and still the pictures/movie would then continue.this was on the whole disc
1,"Changed Ending Stupid, Horrible Change","SPOILER ALERT: In the original ending Ripley grabbed the Alien Queen as she was bursting from her chest, and dragged her into the molten lead. It was the most memorable part of the whole movie. In the Special Edition, they edited this out. The stupidity of this is inexplicable, and unexpected or I never would have wasted my money buying this video. I am disgusted and appalled, and feel robbed."
2,Totally not believable.,"I just don't get it. Why are they sending a woman into space? I'm a proud female and I was always taught that the main duties of women include cooking, making sure the family is content, making clothes and avoiding the work force. So just who does Ripley think she is?? A man?? Uh nooo... but that's not the only reason I give this movie such a low score. The story was boring and aliens were just way too disgusting for me. I also just didn't connect with it. Nothing like this could ever happen. Totally unbelievable. If you want to watch a worthwhile movie, check out Crossroads."
5,Great Movie!,"I love this movie. This one is my favorite in the Alien series, the first Alien is my second favorite, then Ressurection, and finally Alien 3. The new version has great color and sound remastering, and the new footage is great too. I especially like the scene with the remote guns shooting the aliens invading the marines base. This version shows why Ripley was so attached to Newt, because she herself lost her daughter while she was asleep for 57 years. The Director's Cut also shows Newt's family on the colony before the Aliens invade it, showing Newt's dad with a face hugger attached to it which led to the doom of the colony. Buy this version if you are a Alien movie fan, and at least rent it if you are not."
5,Living in a Xenoparadise,"Quite simply, this has to be one the best ""Sci-Fi"" movies ever made. Cruising with Ridley Scott as he explores the darker side of terra-forming and seeing, for the ""first"" time, what this actually encompasses has some great, character-driving qualities which other cuts lacked. Personally, seeing Newt's family before as they introduce our Xeno-hero to those ""juicy colonist daughters"" definitely gives her more oomph. Combining this with newly revised scenes recounting the tales of Ripley's daughter, some nice pictures of the equipment used on that wonderful wasteland of a planet, and the almighty autoguns gives the viewer something that lacked with other released versions. It gives them a clearer window to see everyone's favorite extraterrestrial (with explanations given on Alien ecology that were left out of the Alien that explain the breeding cycle and the roles of the drone) as they fight the good fight against that consuming human blight."
5,Perhaps the greatest sci-fi film of all time ...,"""Aliens"" is the shining star of this series. James Cameron produced a masterpiece which succeeds on multiple levels. The movie provides white-knuckled, edge of your seat excitement. The scenes with the colonial Marines preparing to descend to planet LV-417 are superb and build the tension.Sigourney Weaver as Ripley excels as the on-board Cassandra warning the high-tech warriors that all their vaunted weaponry and arrogance may fare poorly against the potent xenomorph. A terrific supporting cast too. Sprinkled throughout the taut thriller is some funny as hell dialogue and lines which will have you slapping your knees.A masterpiece that survives multiple viewings 22 years after it was first released!"
5,ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST!,"I collect Dance/DJ CD's. This CD is one of the best that I have gotten! ALL tracks are great! (esp #9, DJ MANTA). I definitly recommend this CD to the serious club/dance CD collector."
3,Not what I was expecting,"This book has some great project ideas in it, but it is somewhat lacking in content. I was expecting some better ""how-to"" information than the book presents.Not a bad purchase, but it wasn't as informative as I was expecting."
3,Victorian Style,"Interesting in a quaint, old-fashioned way. There are some good ideas for mortised and other joints. I think most projects in the book would seem labor intensive and time consuming to builders today. Still, a good book for historical perspective on ""wildcrafted"" artifacts for home and garden."
4,Great movie,"This was a great movie with a ""to be continued"" ending"". That greatly takes away from the series since I haven't seen the next episode yet and I can't seem to find it anywhere. If anyone knows, please write in the next review."
3,DO NOT pay inflated prices for this book,"I notice that when books seem out of print the prices on Amazon go berzerk...do a web search, you can purchase a newly updated version of this book, with added pictures for 25 UK pounds...don't be fooled and taken advantage of by a greedy few.NOW on to the book itself...it's ok. It read more like a Gothic Novel, quite flowery, which leaves me wondering, are they retelling true events, or is it a Victorian dark romance? If it is indeed true, the writing style of the book takes away from that, if it is fiction, it's not got a great plot or story line. Interesting enough, either way."
5,Makes you feel homesick even if you never lived there,"This book uses wonderful illustrative posters with related essays to bring alive the past and the present of an important, but neglected region of the country. It also showcases how important a commuter train can be, causing hope that they will once again become more available in other areas."
2,Strictly pictures of promotional pictures.,This is more an art history type of book than railroad history
4,better with time,"I have had this book for over a year and keep coming back to it as the best published source of inspiration for my wedding work. There are some particularly British quirks about it that American photographers (and brides) may be put off by. Regardless, the author's writing and photography styles are refreshing."
3,could be more fun if...,"One fish two fish red fish go fish is a great card game, and the instructions are on the back of the box . The cards are a nice larger version of your standard deck of cards. The bright colors are great. The game is simple and good for ages 3 and up I'd say (matching and counting skills) but the Whorton hears a Who is a bit too complicated, I thought to start playing right away and is definitely for older kids like 4 and up...Maybe if you are familiar with the story of Whorton's Who by dr. seuss the game will make more sense. Otherwise, my son enjoys playing these card games and learns your basic card game skills like shuffling, dealing, turn taking etc..."
1,It works but not as expected,"It works, but when I installed this injector, even when the ad said it was for the Isuzu Hombre 97, I noticed the motor sound and performance changed."
4,What sort of people become obsessed with Scrabble - and why?,"This film is as much a portrait of the people who become obsessed by Scrabble and by words themselves. They vary from stand up comics to professional psychologists to option traders - and all of them approach Scrabble wtih seriousness and great passion.Make no mistake - Scrabble players can make some money and Chris Cree actually won an additional $250,000 plus gambling in Las Vegas during a tournament.Even if you aren't crazy about word games, you'll find thes people fascinating and you may learn something about game strategy along the way."
3,Word freaks united!,"If your a word game addict such as myself, then ""Scrabylon"" is an interesting view into the competetive world of Scrabble players and tournaments.It mostly consists of interviews with the top rated players in the nation....and their thougts and strategies on the game.It also gives a nice look into the tournament scene, and provides a little background on the history of the game.Not a whole lot here to make a movie about - but it is a nice look at an interesting subcultureRecommended for word freaks only!!"
3,"Rich on content, poor on production","The production quality of this award winning documentary leaves a lot to be desired, but the content is worth watching. Most of this video comprises spot interviews with past champions such as Joel Sherman, Brian Cappelletto, Joe Edly et. al. Match coverage is limited, for the most part, to the final series of the 2001 Las Vegas World Scrabble tournament sponsored by Hasbro, the exclusive producer of Scrabble in the U.S.I suppose if the World Championship of Scrabble can only dish out $20K to the champion, one should not expect substantial funding for covering one of these events in a documentary. Nevertheless, if you're a fan of the game, you will find this video entertaining and informative."
3,Not the best out there.,"This Scrabble documentary was less professional than some of the other options. I'm surprised to see that Stefan Fatsis was involved, because his book was great! I definitely recommend Word Wars as a more enjoyable alternative."
3,Good-ish,"This documentary is fun for Scrabble nerds, but lacks the production value for great viewing. The titles and the music are poor, but the interviews are good. Most of the narration is given by the President of the NSA, though all the charm is in the players and champions. Thankfully, there is enough footage of the idiosynchrasies (sp?) of the players to make it enjoyable.If you want a GREAT documentary about the world of Tournament Scrabble, check out ""Word Wars."""
2,Poor Value,"With typographical errors throughout, it's hard to take this book for an English Major seriously. The majority of the book is general and relates more to picking a major than information on a major. There is very little information in here that isn't common sense and only the case studies are of any real value to someone who is already fairly sure of their choice of a major. If you're fairly certian that this is the major for you, don't bother buying this book. You can pick up all of the information applicable to you by browsing through it in the local Borders or B&N."
4,a great addition,Like always Zamfir's ability shows forth......A wonderful addition to any Christmas collection.... and a true joy for the holidays
5,TRACK LIST,Gheorghe Zamfir / The Magic of ChristmasYear: 1994Track Title1. Jingle Bells2. O Tannenbaum3. Hark! The Herald Angels Sing4. Noel Roumains5. White Christmas6. Little Drummer Boy7. Ave Maria8. Petit Papa Noel9. Silent Night10. Angels We Have Heard On High
2,nice product,Product was of good quality but is of no use to me. I bought it to us as an extension cord for my tablet charger and phone charger. However it doesn't work like that so no it is in my junk electronics drawer until I find another use for it.
4,A Psychedelic Space Odyssey,"If that title doesn't stray you, then please read on:This CD contains Wyndorf's ""psychedelic odyssey"" side of his writing--no radio tunes here. Here's a breakdown of the tracks:1 TAB..25 This 32 minute epic is excellent musicianship. It really flows well and is a recommended listen to ALL who dig this genre.2 LONGHAIR This is actually 2 songs jammed together. The split is just after the 8:00 mark. The first number is great and the second one is a little less exciting.3 LORD 13 Good song, but is weaker than the other ones here.4 SPINE OF GOD (live) I just can't get into this song. The sound quality isn't even all that great. LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY this MP3.RECOMMENDED ADD-ON's:BRAINSTORM from ""Superjudge"" and from ""Spine Of God"", get PILL SHOVEL & OZIUM (the demo version is better fitting). These 3 excellent numbers make an excellent finish to this album. Replace the live track with these, and you have a solid 5-STAR album! They are well worth the $$$!"
1,Disappointing,"I am VERY disappointed in this book. The last two chapters (22 and 23) are missing. Also, and more importantly, the Genealogical Record (pages 578-1007)which, according to the index follows Chapter 23, is missing. My primary purpose in ordering this book was to get the genealogical information that the title page promises. Mr. Stearns first book, The History of Rindge, NH, contains a genealogical record, and I assumed that since the title of this book included ""Genealogical Record"" that the same type of information would be available in this book. I was apparently wrong....and feel misled to say the least!I would NOT recommend this book to anyone interested in the genealogical backgrounds of the inhabitants of Ashburnham."
5,A Truly Wonderful Piece of Art,"I came to the Love and Rockets bandwagon late. I first read both Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez a few years ago when I picked up this collection and the ""Heartbreak Soup"" collection by Gilbert and tore through each in turn.This is a review for both, which is perhaps a bit unfair. But I feel that both brothers possess a deep, amazing skill for expressing deeply life in all of its pain and joy. The incredible thing is that, so often, the situations the characters find themselves in seem completely absurd, fantastical, surreal...yet the ""realness"" and vitality of both brothers' work cannot be overstated. I've been reduced to tears by the struggles and successes of Maggie and Hopey, of Heraclio and Carmen; but to mention only these characters doesn't do justice to the power of experiencing the different choices and consequences of each and every character in both series alongside them.Please pick these up and read them--it is so worthwhile."
3,2.5 stars,"Not too many good tunes on this one...probably his weakest pre-1980 cd. There was a reason back then when I finally tuned Elton out of my vinyl collection . The succession of Caribou, Rock of the Westies, and Captain Fantastic all fell off sharply from Honky Chateau, Yellow Brick Road, and Don't Shoot Me......This one appears to be a throw in and more of a hodge podge of songs as opposed to the mood/theme albums he is noted for.IMO; part of a decline in the mid 70's and continuing on until his very good cd ""Sleeping with the Past"" (1989)...and don't miss ""The One"" which was complied around 1992 in Germany and later introduced as an import to the US in 1998. These latter two cd's have great musical arrangement and excellent tonal qualities. Quite nice if you like music that is clean, deep and uncluttered.(imports are generally noted for better sound quality)"
3,Some Good Moments,"Probably the best quality about this release is that it rocks pretty hard. Yell Help, Street Kids, Grow Some Funk Of Your Own, and a few others have gritty styles. Dan Dare is probably the standout piece here because of the funky wah wah guitar lines and Elton John's elaborate vocal stylings. However, as songs go many of the melodies are quite forgettable. Its funny that this record debuted at number 1 when it was released back in 1975. Now this release just pales in comparison to many of Elton's other releases before and after."
3,"Good, but not great '70s album","This one is not bad, but not quite in the league of the preceding EJ albums. I still think Blue Moves should have been included as one of his 'classic 70s' albums. This album rocks start to finish, although most of the lyrics aren't really up to bar with the earlier albums. ROTW has a silly, bouncy flavor to it. If you don't mind that, then get this one. My favorite tune is the opening 'Yell help!/Wendsday night/Ugly'."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...This is Elton's transition album into his worse musical period. The difference between this and his next release ""Blue Moves"" is we don't have to tolerate his mistakes through two CDs! ""Grow Some Funk of Your Own"" is another classic Elton song and the last great song for the rest of the decade."
2,Elton's Tank Runs Out Of Gas,"Sadly, Elton's string of great 70's albums comes to an abrupt halt with the release of what has to be his weakest album since ""Empty Sky"" (or the ""Friends"" soundtrack for that matter). It's sad to watch how low his standards had plummeted in the 3 years since ""Don't Shoot Me"" and ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"". Instead of the driving rock of ""Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting"" Rock of the Westies serves up the cliche-driven ""Grow Some Funk Of Your Own"". Taupin's usual lyrical cleverness is conspicuously absent from weak songs like ""I Feel Like A Bullet (In The Gun Of Robert Ford)"" and ""Billy Bones"". Granted, Elton still had a ways to fall, but his descent unquestionably begins with ""Rock Of The Westies"". I recommend any of his albums prior to this one. This is not the Elton John CD to spend your 13 bucks on if you havent yet purchased ""Dont Shoot Me"", ""Honky Chateau"" or ""Madman Across The Water""."
4,Obscure but not Oblivious,"This was one of the last albums before Bernie and Elton quit working together and was in a peroid of waning popularity for Elton, also he was using many differant musicians in this peroid. This album is worth purchasing alone for the epic and beautiful""I Feel Like a Bullet(In the Gun of Robert Ford), but is then followed by the jazzy and wistful shuffle of ""Feed Me"". Two of Elton Johns greatest tunes in my opinion.Also take a listen to the ""Medley (Yell Help, Wednesday Night,Ugly)"" and of course the Hit ""Island Girl: and you'll see why Elton John is one of the most prolific songwriters of our time."
4,very good but not for everybody,"This is not a very well-known LP of Elton's. However, in my opinion it is one the best. It sounded different, it sounded fresh.....one could breath some freedom from the target of selling at all the costs. Apart from ""Island girl"", more commercial, the rest is an experience....an experience of ""western sound"". I strongly recommend the initial wonderful ""Medley"": for me it is great. Nevertheless, one cannot say this LP is a masterpiece. Moreover, nowadays it sounds a bit ""old-fashioned"". However, it remains a very good work of Elton that could be appreciated by those people with a taste for the ""unusual""."
2,Rock of the Westies,"Ok,maybe I am wrong but this is for me the worst Elton's album. The songs are not catchy. Someone said here that Elton's tank runs out of gas. And that is true. GYBR is great album and also Caribou and other albums from 70'es but this just isn't. Only good song here is Island girl(that is something like Crocodile rock). Dan Dare sounds like ugly interpretation but it's funny.In all this rock songs there are not even a good song like Pinball Wizard or Saturday...! Only good thing is that this is Elton's last album with songs like here. I don't want even to imagine how will be sounded Rock of the Westies(part two). I know that almost no one will be agree with me but don't shoot me ,I am just a guy with my opinion!"
3,'New' Elton starts here,"It may not be quite fair to say Elton ran out of gas with this album. More accurately, this album marks the end of Classic Yellowbrick Elton (with the big, heavy piano) and the start of the light, plastic, Don't Go Breakin' My Sad Songs Elton. The ubiquitous Elton, I suppose.I agree that the production sounds rushed, but only slightly more so than Caribou's production. There's still enough Madman in Elton to make it a worthwhile album however.If you can't stand Still Standing Elton, then you might wait to buy this one until after you've bought all of the albums previous to Rock of the Westies. Then you can enjoy the last sweet vestiges of Eltonian greatness."
5,End of an Era,"Very underrated and under appreciated despite it's status as a #1 record, ROCK remains Elton's hardest rocking and possibly most fun album ever. Memorable songs, catchy choruses, spot-on Bernie Taupin lyrics and an incredibly rough and spectacularly different vocal presence from Elton compared to CAPTAIN FANTASTIC. Definitely in line with CARIBOU, another maligned masterpiece from Elton's purple patch. There would be many more memorable songs in the future (the undervalued EGO for example), but none of his future albums with the possible exception of SLEEPING WITH THE PAST would aspire to such heights as this. You'll enjoy every single track on this great album. Get ready for the 24 carat gold cd being released in march!"
2,Download the few great tracks from this one,"This was a disappointment but it did turn up a few gems. ""Billy Bones and the White Bird"" was a great rocker with thundering drums, a must-have for any Elton John fan. ""Island Girl"" was a textbook Elton John single for that era, and ""I Feel Like A Bullet In The Gun Of Robert Ford"" was a first class Elton John ballad; don't settle for live versions of the song that appear on compilations. Of the remaining six songs only ""Feed Me"" would be worth downloading.Imagine the shock of hearing an album open with not one but two awful songs before rolling into the single. This had been unheard of for an Elton John album up to that point. ""Grow Some Funk Of Your Own"" was a grade Z single at the time and in retrospect is better left forgotten.The few memorable songs make this the last hurrah of Elton's seventies classics. One can't hold his subsequent recording history against him too much though given the string of great music he gave us in the early to mid-seventies."
2,mod revival leaders,"Well, if you were around in 1979 then 'the Chords' must mean something to you.I recently bought this album (after years of trying to find it in dusty record shops).Tracks like 'Maybe Tomorrow' blast me right back to those mod times with a burning nostalgia.Being in England ,only two bands mattered..the kings of em all,The Jam and the Chords.Their version of Sam and Dave's 'Hold on I'm coming',has a raw edge and a certain uniqueness.I'm not too sure about 'she said,she said' though!A lot of these songs hold a real insight into the minds of 19 year old British youth culture,all love and angst.Keep listening...it grows on you!"
5,Good product,"This thermometer works great. It showed me that my oven's temp was off by about 10-15 degrees. A good addition to the kitchen, especially if you like to bake."
1,DOA,"mine was broken and out of its package when i got it, im going to order a different one, mabey it was just that one time"
1,good for a SHORT while,"It worked for a month or so, then it seemed to indicate that my fridge was having issues. I got a service man out and he found the fridge to be working fine. I set the thermometer out in my house where it read almost 90 degrees while every other thermostat/thermometer said 66 degrees. So thanks to this thermometer, I wasted a 60 dollar service fee. So if it indicates problems, check to see if it is working right (in the ""outside"" world) before getting your fridge checked!"
2,Don't plan on hanging this long in your refrigerator.,"Thermometer does work, but the little spot weld that holds on the hanging clip broke off on the first trip."
4,Worth the Price,"Works well and is easy to see. I like that ""the zone"" id highlighted in red (for refrigerator use). The hanger seems to be designed for refrigerators that have metal wire racks as you can't hang it from the glass shelves that I have."
5,Exellent,"Product is exactly like product description, shiping, packing... all was exellentI recomended this."
2,Too strong scent!,Too strong! Not my scent! It gives me headache.---I bought this several months ago and tried several times to appreciate the smell since all the reviews were great but this is really a strong scent and I can't take it. Sorry...
2,I received the purchase opened,"Is my mom's favorite perfum, in Mexico I have troubles to find it. I bought it in this web site but I received the perfum opened and somebody used it because the original package was open."
5,Tres francais,"Je suis alle a Paris beaucoup d'annees longtemps. J'ai trouve un magazin de parfum, et, en mon francais tres pauvre, j'ai demande un parfum tres francais pour mon epouse, et ce parfum est l'un que la jeune fille a recommande."
4,A little dab will do you,"I breezed by a woman in the airport and had to ask her what she was wearing. Very nice, but... just a single tiny spritz on your wrists. Too strong for me up by my neck where I usually place my perfume. Have had lots of compliments from both genders and inquiries as to name of pefume."
5,Viva La Gordita!,"As a lover of salsa music, this is a fanatstic CD! If you love Latin music you will love this work. The music is invigorating, and the vocals are sensuous and smooth! Buy this CD, you won't regret it! Viva salsa, Viva La Gordita!"
1,CHATTER CHATTER TALK TALK TALK,CHATTER CHATTER TALK TALK TALK... IF YOU WANT TO HEAR CABALLE SING DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DVD. THERE'S LITTLE MUSIC - AND WHEN CABALLE DOES SING SHE'S IMMEDIATELY DROWNED OUT BY BABBLING COMMENTARY... I WOULD RATE IT LOWER THEN ONE STAR - BUT THERE IS NO LOWER RATING.
4,Low-Profile Field Cones,"The cones are great to have for a variety of functions. I use them regularly to set up end zones to the mark the field for ultimate frisbee games and to set up drills for agility training.A big positive about the cones is that they stack on each other for convenient storage. Also, they are very resilient and durable.The only possible negative is that the profile is low. From far away, the visibility of the cones is not so great."
2,9-Year Paytrust Veteran Quitting!,"I have been with them since they were PayMyBills, but the software (actually, it's their website) has become so filled with bugs that I am beginning to find it unusable.And the new owner (Intuit) doesn't seem very interested in fixing them, although each ""enhancement"" introduces new ones.So I am now searching for a replacement. I would hate to go back to paper, but I just might do that."
1,You are paying for what you can do for free??,"Why do you need software to pay bills? Most major banks, and 3rd parties, like MSN and Yahoo offer web-based bill pay services. I did buy this when it first came out, and quickly dumped it due to finding out later I could do more by hooking MS Money directly to a bill pay service."
1,IQ weakest album,"I agree at 100% with the previous reviewer telling this album is the weakest of IQ and with his comment about their great comeback later with Ever and Subterranea. I cannot undertstand how somebody can rate this as the best cd ever maid! C'mon, have you ever heard Genesis ""Selling England..."", Pink Floyd ""Wish you..."" or Flower King ""Stardust...""This is the lowest point in IQ history, the best was few years later."
5,Nomzamo is the best examples of IO's immaculate music.,The album is a great example of IQ's capability to produce immaculate and monarchical music. Nomzamo and No Love Lost are inspiring and breathtaking. The lyrics of Human Nature are a masterpiece. The rythm and melody changes are stunning.
4,Not strictly progressive but...,"This album was released during the period in which IQ changed temporarily his original singer (who then reunited with the band and still remains in the group). With the entrance of the new vocalist the group acquired a more commercial oriented approach, which perhaps hadn't the favor of the most progressive fans of the band. Still, for me is a very good album with an excellent and very catchy song: ""Promises"""
2,I played it twice,I have been a Vollenweider fan for as long as I can remember. When I saw a new CD by him I bought two copies so I could turn someone else on to his music. I am sad to say that this collaboration with Carly didn't work for me. There is not enough Andreas playing his contemporary style and arrangements for harp. What was there was rarely exciting or inspired. This CD will get one more play before it get relegated to the back of the pile. Too bad.
4,Any time of year,"I purchased this CD because it has a couple of tracks with vocals by the one and only Carly Simon.Carly Simon and Andreas have collaberated over many years, and this is the latest one.Don't be fooled in to thinking though that this is just a Christmas album, because it's certainly not. In fact you can put this on any time of year and it can be played gently in the background to envelope your dinner party guests! The Christmas themes are there, but they are quite subtle (unlike me!).Andreas plays the harp and if you like to be soothed this will certainly do the trick.And if you love the timbre of Carly's gorgeous voice, you won't be dissapointed either!"
4,Need to relax this is it,Like with all of his album they are older full too play while cooking dinner or while eating dinner. I find his music total relaxing . It just makes you want to slow down and enjoy life
2,Big Disappointment,"I've been a huge fan of Andreas Vollenweider for years, so I eagerly looked forward to hearing this CD. Sorry to say, this is a major disappointment. The ONLY track worth hearing a second time is ""Midnight Clear"", with Carly Simon's achingly beautiful vocals. The worst crime is ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring"" -- one of the most sublime pieces of music ever written, here marred beyond repair by the senseless addition of a bizarre repetitive interlude midway through. As if JS Bach needed any improvement. Fans of Christmas music, classical music, jazz, Andreas Vollenweider or Carly Simon -- steer clear of ""Midnight Clear."""
5,Midnight Clear CD,"As always, Vollenweider music is completely enchanting and Midnight Clear is exactly that. Such a beautiful collection of old and new holiday music which my husband and I loved so much that we played it more than any other holiday album and will enjoy it all year as well. Thank you, Andreas Vollenweider and all the other members of your group, for giving us such a beautiful musical treasure!"
4,A great read,I believe that this story was a great description of a persons will and determination to survive. The book is very well explained and tells a lot about the human spirit. It is something that you would read on a rainy Saturday afternoon with a cup of hot cocoa or a hot cup of coffee whatever you prefer. A great read indeed.
2,Not what I expected,"This book is not a tale of survival of a bear attack, which is what I thought it would be. Its more like a book about the author's depression. I was expecting a story about the actual attack and the events which happened immediately after the attack, sort of like the mountain climbing accidents I often read about. It was nothing like that at all. Also, this book is not for those with a queasy stomach. I could hardly read some of the details of surgery and medical conditions."
2,no universality classes...,"Per Bak has a record as one of the best, most stimulating physicists of our age. However, I am not happy with the idea of SOC and do not count it as among his best work. The weakness is that universality classes for sandpile models (and complex adaptable systems) have never been defined. Without universality classes one cannot claim that an arbitrary mathematical model (like a sandpile model or a 'complex adaptable system') describes or explains anything in nature. One or a few scaling exponents do not define a universality class for systems away from criticality. There is no evidence, to date, that turbulence, economics, and most other phenomena that occur in nature or society are critical phenomena. Socio-economic phenomena surely do not obey any invariant laws of motion. I suspect that the best that one can hope for is a model that maybe works temporarily and then fails because moods and behavior change, like the Black-Scholes option pricing pde."
1,Physicist Opens Lab Window,"Science often progresses when physicists open their lab windows and look at the real world. Bak's book is a fun popular read for everyone.His intent on being the man who extented Newton's laws is self evident. Not a scholarly text, not probably intended to be so, Bak is quite unaware of intellectual activities other than his own.Other reviews point out the complete lack of reference to fundamental advances in what he claims to be HIS invention.We in geology welcome Bak's discovery of the real world."
1,Poorly written drivel,"I have read a large number of books on complex systems but this one is by far the worst that I have come across. The writing is poor, unengaging, and overly verbose. He also tries to give himself much more credit than he is due. Given Bak's obnoxious reputation, I should have expected this but I had my hopes before I started reading. Unfortunately I put the book down completely unimpressed. Skip this book and pick up anything by Stu Kauffman (try ""Investigations"")."
1,an obvious rip off...,"this guy, Jon, has read Shiguro Takada's Contingency Cannibalism, and attempted to capture the flavor of a much better, more clever book. He tried to avoid the same topics while attempting to imitate Shig's flip attitude, and that left a huge vacancy in this topic."
1,Worthless,This book will make you laugh - only for the wrong reasons. You will laugh when it occurs to you that this book is even around. I am so mad that I wasted money on this trash. Don't make the same mistake.
5,A hysterical read!,A hysterical read! Perfect for the meat-eating joker in your family come holiday time.
1,Did not agree with other reviewers,I think this book is by far the most un-funny book I've seen. I think it is child-ish and not sophisticated enough for the more mature reader. Definitley not a gift-worthy book. It's too weird.
5,"Hilarious, rough humor - not for wimps.","This is the type of stuff guys would joke about after having a few drinks. And let's face it - haven't your friends made you laugh harder than any comedian has? The author has captured the same kind of natural humor on paper. I guess some people would find portions of it too rough, but those are the parts I found the funniest. If you're squeamish about dark humor(Hey, it's only words.) take a star or two off my rating.Women, take a guy's advice - this would make a great gift for your husband or boyfriend."
1,Enough old jokes!,"It's obvious to me that this author writes for Jay Leno and boring award shows (as indicated on the book sleeve). Here is yet another book of over-used humor and jokes that are ""formula"". I think if you are 10 to 12 years old, you might think this book is funny. If your an adult, forget about it. You've heard this all before and it's not exactly entertaining to read a book in the form of a cookbook."
1,Is this supposed to be funny?,"I read this book. Please - someone tell me where I went wrong! Show me the jokes!I say skip this purchase. If it's humorus books your'e looking for, try Dave Barry or Steve Martin. This book is just one step above ""safe humor"" - the kind of humor that plays it safe for everyone, including people who love to hear the same stuff over and over again....."
4,Tadd Dameron displays his big band writing ability,"Tadd Dameron was one of the heroes of the be bop era. He was a great composer and arranger and a rather average pianist. He made this recording in 1962 and assembled some outstanding musicians. I am not aware of any other examples of Philly Joe Jones anchoring a big band but he does it quite well. There are many other stars here including Clark Terry, Jimmy Cleveland, Johnny Griffin, Bill Evans and Ron Carter. Many of the Tadd Dameron classics are here but my one complaint is that often the numbers are too short. The great soloists should have been given more room to blow. This is a very good CD that could have been a classic."
5,A beautiful and vital book,"This excellent collection of interviews is a wonderful contribution to both the literary and Christian communities. Each of the twelve subjects deserves a greater audience within these two groups, and most of them discuss the difficulties of crossing the divide between them. For readers familiar with the subjects' work, this collection offers a much needed focus on the spiritual themes and influences of their fiction. For new readers, this collection is a perfect introduction to writers worth reading. If you enjoy this book and would like to continue along similar lines, try The Christ-Haunted Landscape:Faith and Doubt in Southern Fiction. This is a collection of interviews with contemporary Southern writers. Susan Ketchin (who is, coincidentally, the wife of Faith and Fiction subject Clyde Edgerton) is the interviewer/author."
4,Standard but tasty fare,"Wodehouse continues with his wonderful recipe of decadent peerage, hopelessly-in-lovers, imposters and theft plots in another Blandings Castle book. To this delightful mix, is added an American dash in the form of Mr.Peters, a multimillionaire with poor digestion and poorer temper and his sweet wisp of a daughter Aline Peters, engaged to be married to Freddie Threepwood. Ashe Marson (author of Gridley Quayle, detective fiction and avid practicioner of the Larsen exercises) and Joan Valentine (ex-chorus girl, former paramour of Freddie and always ready to take life by the bull's horns)bring in even more flavour to this already succulent mix. What's really interesting is how the lead characters come and go but Blandings Castle and its inmates remain part of the unchanging, everlastingly witty backdrop. 'Something Fresh' uses standard Wodehousian plot ingredients but manages to keep you laughing all along, nevertheless."

3,GOOD...BUT AS HE ENDS HIS BOOK.....HE DESROYED IT!,"well i 've read this book two times!! he has intresting stories in there and most of the facts that he writes is true!!!but he finally does what almost everyone did in 1993 for GnR : he says some personal thoughts that really are so...untrue and dishonest!! the only thing that really is good in this book is the pictures and the concerts reviews ..also the stories of the band members in the early days , back in 1985-86! GNR FOREVER !!!!!!!"
1,Pump doesn't last,"Pump came with my 18' pool purchased June 2008. It only lasted 4 months of use. It was very noisy, but pulled water fairly well. Not really strong enough for the size pool. The first 3 months of the season of use, it worked well. The second season it only worked 1 month before it died. I would suggest purchasing a lot strong pump for the bigger pools. This size is just not strong enough nor durable enough for 18' pool."
2,Intex model 635 pump,"I totally agree. It seems this model has alot of problems with the impellar design. I purchased a brand new 18'X9'x52"" Ultra frame pool ( just out this year) and this ""rock tumbler"" sounding pump is what I got. I even have the salt water system to go with it from last year. The cheap pump that came with the 12'x30"" was alot quiter than this. Google the model 635 pump and look at all the the complaints on it. For those of you who said it works great, count yourself as one of the few lucky ones."
4,"Good, but noisy","I previously saw a review describing this pump as noisy. Indeed, of all the pumps that we had purchased, this is the loudest when the pool is empty or at night.Other than that, it has been working well, alone or with other attachments such as a skimmer."
3,issues,"We have had our pool (15 ft)for many years now and replaced our original filter with this model. For the two years that it worked, it kept the pool clean. The impeller has broken and they (Intex)do not have replacement parts for it. Buyer beware. This is definately a short term pump. Do not buy it if you wish to keep your pool over the long term. We are planning on getting a larger pool that comes with a pump. I personally would look into a higher quality unit if I was to replace this now broken one."
1,washed out pool pump,"This filter pump leaves much to be desired. We replaced a smaller pump wtih this one, based on ""rave"" reviews and now have a pump that just doesn't clean the pool. Don't know if it is a lousy pool or lousy vender."
2,Not that great,"Purchased a small Intex pool last summer and the 1,000 gallon pump went out 2-days after purchase. We purchased the next larger size pump this summer (the smaller pump had horrible reviews). This pump has different attachments than then 1,000 gallon pump...with a little caulking we managed to make the pieces fit he pool with a water-tight seal. The pump does not clean the pool water well at all...but at least it is still working 2 weeks later."
3,filter pump,"it is very noisy, i expected it to be quiet, it being noisy it sounds cheap and I figure i will haveto replace it soon"
2,Works for a few days and quits,"I have sent back two pumps and now I'm on my third it seems to keep working for 3 weeks of last summer till I took the pool down for the year. I hope that the pump works when I set it up for this summer. I will say one thing they did replace the pumps within a reasonable turnaround. But for the quality of the pump, it is not very good. The bearings on the impeller and the way it is designed is really bad and allows the impeller to flop around inside and eventually stop turning because of the rubbing on the side of intake part of the pump. This is what failed on both of the pumps I returned. Good Luck."
1,what a joke,Crap. The impeller broke in three months of less-than-normal use and they would not replace it. My choice was buy another pump - take it or leave it.
5,Glad to get it!,"This pump was backordered and I was afraid I would have to wait weeks for it. It was here in 10 days. This pump works so much better than the small pump that comes with the pool (15' x 48"") Well worth the money."
4,Better than previous Pumps,This pump is a better pump than previous pumps I have owned. I truly saw a difference in the water and filtration. It made pool vacuuming so much easier and filled up so much faster. Great pump!
1,Impeller Failed,"Almost lasted one season before the impeller quit. The pump started making a loud noise after 4 months of lite to moderate use. After that the impeller failed completely...Intex would not replace without a sales receipt although I tried to provide proof of purchase through credit card statement. Ive bought 3 pools over the last many years and have really enjoyed them, this is the first time the pump gave out before the pool...this pump is of a very poor design. If you purchase make sure you keep a receipt as you will most likely have to replace it within one season."
5,INTEX MODEL 635 POOL FILTER PUMP KIT Review,Pump works great was easy to install and operate. Changing the filter is alot easier than the original pump and keeps my pool cleaner. Also it was the best price I could find for it.
3,pump,I don't know how durable because it is still newA little noisybut it seems to work great so farI recommend you upgrade if you have a smaller pump that came with your pool
1,Awful pump,"We got an Intex 18' x 48"" Easy-Set Above-Ground Pool. The pool is great, especially if you combine it with an Intex Krystal Clear Saltwater Water Sanitizing System.The pump however has plastic blades that break very fast... not to mention that the water and dirt pass through the pump before going to the filter for some reason.This Pump is awful. Expect to replace it once a year."
1,"Can't be used with Quick Set pools, way too heavy.","I wasted the money I spent on this filter, it clearly stated it was for Quick Set pools, not so. The hardware that must be hung on the side of the pool is way too heavy for a Quick Set and can't be used. Beware!! We had to leave off the filters that are to be mounted on the side of the pool and buy all kinds of adapters, because the hose is much bigger around than the previous hoses that came with the pool. Not to be use with Quick Set pools!"
2,short life,"This it the fourth one of these pumps that I have owned and the life of the pump is short. They all become hard to turn on and eventually won't turn on at all. The pump pin shaft breaks, but the only option is to buy a larger pump at a larger cost and I am not sure of the durability of the larger pump."
2,After a month I'm having problems with it.,"I purchased this pump one month ago. It worked great for 3 weeks and now within the last week it is only working on and off and when it does it is making a horrible sound. Note: the issue I am having has nothing to do with the timer being set on it, as you have the option to use the timer or not. I am not pleased at all with this filter pump for my above ground pool."
3,Its okay I guess,"Having some problems, sometimes it doesn't want to be as strong as others, still working with it. Hoping it is just the filter."
3,just got this and it's already had issues!!!,So I've had this pump installed for less than a week and despite the pump and filter obviously being OUTDOORS and made for that the GFI plug that it comes with is already broken. it won't reset at all because water gets into it! so I went to home depot and replaced the GFI with a regular plug and plugged it INTO a GFI plug so it's still got the GFI action. it was HORRIBLE!!!hasn't even been working a week! ok so now I have it put back together but after having it for just a week it shoudln't need to be FIXED! I have to say however when it WORKS It works very well.
1,"Pump problems, Amazon problems? Me too","Let's see, a hidden pump part breaks with no way to fix it. I stupidly bought another one from Amazon. Paid 2 day shipping of almost $30. Note still on Amazon page, ""hurry only three left in stock"". Well, having them in stock, and paying 2 day shipping, Amazon says I should receive the pump between July 29th to Aug 5th. I ordered the pump June 28th.I guess Intex, Amazon and I make up the three stooges."
4,So Far so good,We had to buy a replacement pump because our original pump that came with our pool ( 2yrs old)went out. I really like this pump and the hook-ups for the hoses that attach to the pool! You do not have to place a plug in the in & out of the returns all u have do is just on the outside of the pool where the hoses hook up @ is just pull the little plunger thingy and it stops all the flow of water for eaiser changing of the the filter. I especiall love it has a timer. I have only on extra thing to say is that if you have the Easy Pool 16 x 42 yo will have to make the holes bigger on the side of the pool so these attachements for the hoses can fit no need to buy any adapters my kit came with all the parts needed :o)
4,Needed the timer,"This is our third pump, all the same model. I really think we were leaving them on too long and burned the pump up. So I was excited to see this pump now has a timer. Kit was complete with all the fittings and hoses one might need. Shipping time was great and professional. This will be the last pump I buy one way or the other. So far so good, but the pump is new...we'll see."
2,pool ump,This product is underpowered and noisy. It also burns out very easily. It's only redeeming quality is that it can be adapted to most pools.
5,works great,I've had it for about a month now and the pump works great. This is our second one though. *make sure that you check the screen that covers the inlet valve once a month for junk build-up. The instruction booklet doesn't say to but that's how we burnt up our last pump.
5,Best Of The Best,Excellent service with the know how to get your product to your door fast! Product is flawless and performs well. Will definitely be a repeat customer!
4,Works like it should!,Not a whole lot to say about this...you need it for the shower to work but it is as expected.
3,What are we brewing?,"I have used this tea for several months and find that it does help me maintain weight. But I am a bit worried about the strong smell of insecticide which was present in several shipments. This odor not only came from the package itself, but was equally strong in the tea that I brewed. To be sure it was not an overreaction on my part, I asked someone else, ""What do you smell?"" The response was ""bug spray."" This box of tea was not the first time this has happened. Several times before I noticed the same smell, but stupidly continued to drink the tea. In fact, my daughter refused to drink it saying it smelled like bug spray. So beware."
4,I highly recommend it,"My acupuncturist recommended this tea to me, and along with other TCM and in conjunction with acupuncture, increased activity and healthy eating, I think it helps. Mainly, I've noticed better digestion, decreased bloating, and decreased constipation when I drink at least two cups a day."
4,rating on the seller,"I think the shipping cost is a little high. But, I received the tea quite promptly."
5,Appetite control and a great feeling,I have been using this product for about 4 months. It gives me an empowered feeling and makes me forget about food. No explosive side effects like you get with other diet teas. One cup leaves me feeling positive and with the strength to make good choices about what I eat. Does not taste bad either.
4,BOJENMI TEA REVIEW,The product is good and the service Amazon offers is great. The purchase process was easy and I got the merchandise very quickly.
3,Bojenmi Tea,The tea was nothing special for taste however it might have ingredience that help w/ weight loss of other things.
2,blech,"tasted like raid and did nothing. giant bags if u want lots of blech tea also, i think my amazon id was hacked after visiting this site. just say no!"
4,Logitech Optical Mouse,"A bit lighter than what I normally prefer in a mouse. But none the less, very functional and available at a price that could not be beat!"
5,Logitech Mouse,"The mouse works great, it's lightweight and comfortable to hold. No point in spending big bucks on an expensive mouse that's going to make your hand cramp."
1,I must have gotten a lemon,"I see quite a few good reviews on here, but this mouse was just awful after about a month of use. Something must be wrong with the way they designed the buttons. All the time I'm single clicking on something and it registers a double click. I try and click and drag something and it releases halfway through without me moving a finger on the button. And this wasn't just a Windows setup problem, I've tried changing the mouse speeds with no success. These two issues cause contstant problems when opening, deleting, and moving files in Windows. I'm getting a replacement asap."
1,All over the place!,I downloaded the upgrades for the mouse online and for the week I used it had the problem of trying to keep the pointer from moving where I didn't want it to go. I play online games and it couldn't keep up. I ended up buying the laser mouse and smashing this product with a hammer. That was the only satisfaction I got from using this. I did stick with Logitech and got thier laser mouse which works great. I've always used thier products so one bad apple wasn't going to spoil it for me.
5,Simple plug and play mouse.,"Not much to say about this basic mouse except that it is super easy to hook up and use.You just plug the mouse into your pc mouse port and your done,no drivers to install,no software to take up space on your hard drive,just plug this thing in and it's ready to go.Because this is an optical mouse there is no mouse ball to get dirty and muck up the works,this thing has a little red light at the bottom of it that works as a mouse ball would.The light reflects off of the surface that you are using and makes this mouse as easy to use as a regular old school mouse but without the dirty trackball.Simple and easy to use.Works great."
2,At this price point i think the many other mice feel more solid than this logitech mouse.,"I mainly chose this mouse because I needed one quickly and it was black and matched my set up. I had been using the standard greyish white optical mouse with a scroll wheel and a red light that shined out from under my wrist. This one feels smaller, but still comfortable. However a couple weeks of normal usage made the mouse much less solid feeling. The plastic now mushes as the seems flex slightly in my hand. I decided to have a friend repair the cable of my old mouse. :-/ I am going to donate this mouse to a friend who still has a tracking ball mouse. I like some of Logitechs products and higher end mice. But I would stay away from this mouse. Its not bad, its just not good enough to pick over other mice that cost the same amount.Hope that helps.Awesomefunn"
3,This is so old style.,"I guess everybody will not buy this type of mouse anymore. Wired mouse era is completely gone now. Though, at this time, this mouse was good."
4,my favorite mouse,"I've used a lot of mice in 25 years of computing. In recent years I've settled on this one - I keep buying more and more of them for all the different systems around the office. Just a really good feel, smooth action, accurate tracking."
4,Logitech Optical Mouse- Black,"1:Touch & Feel : Very good (Comfortable to use)2:Response: As it fits to your hand, you can expect good movement.I always (have been, I mean) used and use a trackball. But my trustyLogitech Trackball was showing ages, I grabbed this optical mouse.(No need to clean dirts...that's what an optical mouse is all about)3: Value: There are many cheap mouse(mice) from China/Taiwan. But theyoften show problems,including driver compatibility issue with XP.If you can buy a reliable mouse around $16, and if it comes from Logitech,it is a good buy."
5,"Simple, easy ... Great gift for Dad","My dad's tech savvier than most, but he appreciates simplicity and ease of use above all else when it comes to his personal computer set-up. So, while I started out looking at the shiny logitechs with a zillion buttons, I went with this one for him. It's optical with the two standard buttons and the middle button scroll. Doesn't need batteries since it's got a wire. Best of all: no installation of software and no checks for updates. Just plug it in and you're good to go.My dad and I both are very happy."
4,A decent mouse...,"For a mouse valued at $12 and eligible for free shipping on orders worth over $25 (at least it was for me when I got it from amazon.com) this mouse is decent at best. I will be brief as possible in addressing its characteristics.Pros-Price-Color - I personally don't like white mice...they turn biege after a long time.-cord length-usb/p/s switchableCons-Mouse tends to make a squeaky noise when used to click after being used for a long time.-cheap feel. It's made in China, so like everything else made from there, it's made out of plastic. Makes stuff cheap and light. I guess that we can't ""have it all."""
4,A better mouse!,Logitech Optical Mouse is an excellent value for those looking to purchase a new mouse and not having to deal with replacing a track ball. The mouse works on pretty much any smooth surface.
3,sometimes crappy,"sometimes the mouse moves a little, and sometimes it just jets all over the screen but not often. all in all average quality."
3,nice,"if you use it for the laptop, its size is a little bit larger,and the lenghth of its cable is longer than what I need."
1,The worst,This is the worst mouse I have ever used! I use it with Wow on a Wintel and it's horrible. I have a Kensington mouse I use on my eMac that was about the same price and it is much better!
2,Logitech optical mouse,I have had this mouse for only a few days. It works well with no installation involved. The absence of a trackball to do the job lessens the parts for wear and tear. I hope it works well for a long time.
2,Wireless Mouse,You must have the mouse very close to the computer or it will not work. very poor range coverage.
4,Great Basic Mouse,"Inexpensive with all of the basic features. Works well on most surfaces, absolutely no problems with connection and recognition by the computer."
3,Flawed. I have to find another one.,"Overall this clock does it's job well. You can turn the dial behind the clock to move the hands, and your child can use the stub on the minute hand to advance the clock also. The precise mechanism ensures the hour hand is centered on numbers when the minute hand is at 12. The hands are also keyed to synchronize with the digital readout, which has little sliding doors for hours & minutes so you have the option to selectively hide them.A major flaw is the long hour hand whose wide arrowhead blocks the numeral on the dial whenever the minute hand is on 12. The first lesson on telling time is one o'clock, two o'clock, etc. but when you ask children what time it is, they will be hard pressed to answer because they can't see the number the hour hand is on! The only reason I can imagine why the manufacturer did this is so children do not become dependent on reading the numerals to tell time. Well, now I need to find another teaching clock."
5,Learning To Tell Time... Must Have!,"I bought this for my son to reinforce telling time. It has little windows at the bottom that open and close that tell you the hour, the minutes, and the time of day of what is on the face of the clock. Great to quiz with. I was happy to see how large it was and my son said it was the same as his teachers. I bought it at a great price and I wasn't sure if it was going to be cheaply made and it wasn't. Super buy and worth more then what I paid."
3,Could've been better,"I am also unimpressed with this clock, as was one of the other reviewers. As they stated, the hand covers the number, adding another level of frustration for very young learners who haven't already memorized the clock face yet. My other disappointment is that the ""digital"" readout on the bottom isn't meshed well. When the clock stops at the top of the hour, the numbers are between 59 and 60 so it looks like it is saying 96 in the minutes window. It doesn't line up well.It's sturdy, and you can spin from the knob in the back or from the hour hand itself, and there's also a kickstand in back like a picture frame so you can pull that out and have this sitting without any concerns of it falling over. Also wished they had actually put the numbers for ALL the minutes on the periphery, rather than just 5, 10, 15, etc.."
4,JCVD vs DL = Good time,"Universal Soldiers is one of those films that delivers on many different levels. It is an action packed film. It has a good story to go with that action. It has some comedic moments and it has some old school direction. One of the very few good Rolan Emmerich films that has come our way. The story is pretty simple , but it has many layers. It is a film about loyalty , orders , honor and betrayal. It is about what defines a machine and what defines a human and where do we draw the line. I think if your looking for something fun with a story and some cool action. You can't go wrong with this movie. Jean Claude Van Damme is great with his moves and his acting gets better. Dolph well he steals the show and he is all "" ears"" here pun intended. This blu-ray has a good video and audio track and it is a decent upgrade and at the price it is selling. Def worth a buy."
3,"so,so","i was a bit disapointed with that movie,maybe because when younger i liked it while van damme was good in movies"
3,Human nature,They were created to fight against everything but their beings could not reject and fight against their human nature.
3,"BluRay and Hokey, a happy marriage","I liked the original version; but, as I am replacing titles with the BluRay, this was merely an update to the library.The quality is stunning, the movie.....eh?!?!?Its still amazing to watch the progression of refining the images and sounds with ths new technology."
4,DVD transfer well done but short on extras,"The movie has a lot of action in it and a decent story. I bought the DVD and like the movie. The DVD has above average picture and sound that make the special effects even more stunning. The DVD is short on extras though. It does have trailors, but no commentary track. It also has a behind the scenes special, but it only lasts 6 minutes. It is still a good action movie and worth seeing."
4,Watch your ears!,"I payed under $10 for this BLUERAY movie and of course, I wasn't going to pass this up. VAN DAMME is one of the best martial artist that I have seen on film and still kicks ass in this movie. DALPH is also very crazy in the movie by stealing as many human ears as possible. Ill never forget these two heros. To me, THEY WILL ALWAYS BE HEROS!!"
4,Mahem,"If you like mahem, this is the movie for you. More action than any one person can stand. The reporter put some credence into the non-stop action."
3,"Ok,Typical Van Damme with a little Sci-fi",It was a decent movie i happen to live where it was filmed see the annotation.Universal Soldier has what almost every Van Damme movie doesn't.Sci-Fi.That's the only thing that makes this vehicle unique.
2,NO,"Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren in the same movie... (screams of torture). This movie is unbelievably average and you would think director Roland Emmerich of ""Independence Day"" would have come up with something better than this movie. Van Damme doesn't speak much, that's a plus. Lundgren talks too much and needs to put a sock in it. Awful."
2,Universal Soldier,"My kind of movie, mindless violence. Lots of explosions and action scenes. It seemed a little dated, special effects have come a long way since 1992. Van Damme plays his usual role (macho man), so you know what to expect. Not a great movie, but if you just want to escape for an hour and a half, it will do the job."
1,one of the worst god dame movies ever,this just proves that all americans are dumb anyone who likes this movie is any american and that is not a good thing i only have to say one thing VAN DAMME
4,I need some Ice,"Universal Soldier DVDIt all began in the jungles of Vietnam. Two dead soldiers were rescued from death in a secret governmental program. Unfortunately some memories still linger. This movie pits Jean-Claude Van Dame against Dolph Lundgren. Who do you think will win?Recommended for fans of Jean-Claude Van Dame and Dolph Lundgren.Gunner April, 2008"
5,Great Buy!,"I bought this drive two years ago while in college for digital art. Huuuge files that needed to travel with me and be secured. My flash drive absolutely could not fail.This drive has never died, been corrupted or lost anything. It's totally solid and it holds a TON of photoshop documents. This is my third Transcend product and I love all of them. It's great that I don't have to worry about my files and documents; they're all right there on my drive.Awesome product and worth way more than the cost."
5,Good pen drive,"Flash drive works great. It suites my needs. Small, affordable, and absolutely usable!I've used it for awhile and it's worked the whole time."
1,Defective by Design,"This drive seems to require special drivers to work with Windows. I don't know what else could be the cause of constant ""write protection"" errors.I've tried all the solutions suggested online, including the mFormat utility that wipes all data from the drive, and I still can't save anything to it.Their support site is useless. It's tedious to browse through the documentation, and requesting support requires filling out a form with dozens of irrelevant fields.I'm never buying a Transcend product again."
2,Slow write speed,"I get about 2 MB/s write speed when copying large files to this drive. It took over an hour to reformat it with Windows 7. There is nothing 'Jet"" or 'Flash' when you are copying data to this drive. The computer store advertised it as 'High Speed'. The only thing high speed about it is the USB 2.0 port. I get about 14MB/s read speed. Reading files from this drive seems reasonably fast. I've been using this drive for 2 days now. So far, it seems to work ok. It's just slow. I read that it's supposed to have a blue LED. Mine has no working LED at all."
2,Transcend wants to Rob Me -,The USB flash drive failed after 4 monthsa and I got an RMA and mailed it back under warranty. Transcend sent out the item after repair but it was returned to them by the USPS as undeliverable (may be the label got damaged?). Transcend will NOT send it out again unless I pay them $20. What about that for highway robbery. Choose a reputable supplier instead. Transcend sucks!
1,"Do not buy, it broke in a month","I bought two of them, one works fine, other is recognized but all the files are gone and won't let me write any other files. It is basically fried. it is cheap and shows why it is cheap."
2,Not the best drive,Purchased 2 and both don't work well. Figured a flash drive is flash drive but in this case that is not true. Worst drives I ever purchased and would not but this brand again
3,Compared to Kingston...slower with my use.,I have Transend SD cards (Class 6) that I put in USB holders and they are fast and similiar in transfer speed as avi's to a USB..KingstonI bought 2 of the 8gb USB and I noticed they are slower than the Kingston USB.I transfer avi's to them.Anyone else notice this?Update...also reads slower....with my Media Player.Because of this I would not buy another.
1,Awful,"Guys, Do NOT buy Transcend flash drives. My first one went bad after little use. So I got it replaced. This one lasted a little bit longer but eventually went bad within an year. The product physically looks ok but the quality is awful. For the price this item has, it's not recommended at all. Cheap stuff sold at high price."
5,NO COMPLAINTS,AS EXPECTED...GOOD DELIVERY TIMEGOOD SERVICEGOOD PRODUCT!I'LL BUY AGAIN ON THIS SITE...
1,Memory Unstable,"I purchased one of these with because I lost my Lexar FireFly and wanted something cheap. This obviously was a mistake. I have to keep a backup of it on my desktop at all times because it loses data about 1/3 of the time when I plug it in, especially right after copying files (and even with a safe eject). I would not recommend this project to anyone unless you truly enjoy being frustrated and wasting time."
4,Small and Light,"This is a really small unit. Its so small and light that i forget that i have it some times. Like someone else said, I was also surprised at how small it was. The case and polished black and really sleek looking. My package didnt come with a lanyard tho, so i cant comment on that. It does transfer slightly slower than i would have expected."
3,"Nice design, reliability questionable","I really like the design/styling of the Transcend JetFlash V30. The color coding for memory capacity is a nice touch, nothing new, but helpful. As beautiful as they are, they do scuff up quickly.Speed wise, no complaints. Reasonable performance for price. They seem to be at least as fast as my OCZ Rally2, which claims to be fast.My biggest concern is reliability. I've bought 2 and 4 GB versions of the JetFlash. I've checked both regularly with Apple's Disk Utility prior to storing data on them and both have required minor ""repairs"" twice in under a month. This is troubling as I haven't used them a lot and the most physical abuse they've experienced with being carried in a shirt pocket."
4,Slow to write small files,"It's fast at reading all files, and fast at writing large files, but slow at writing a large number of small ones. It took me over 1 hour to copy abt 500kB of small files.I left a msg with techsupp on their website months ago but heard nothing. Yet, I found other users on their website with the same complaint. Not sure if other mfgrs do much better, however."
1,Don't waste your money with it!,I bought one in a computer store and it broke the same day. I lost all my data I had in it.This is a waste of money.
4,Does the job,"This jump drive does the job. I honestly bought it for the low price which was great. I have had it for a few months now, and it hasn't failed me yet. It's simple and easy to use like most jump drives."
4,Great Item!,I honestly wish I'd ordered more of these. The one I did get is great. Fast shipping too! A good buy for the price and I've yet to have any conflicts with hardware or software.
3,Good one,"No complaints and the best part of it is very robust. Even after getting drenched ,dropping umpteenth number of times I still can plug this drive and use it for my college courses."
2,CUTE BUT....,"Very slim and attractive. Comes with its own lanyard. However, if you're planning to wear this on your neck or dangle it from a bag, let's, say, I warn you that the cap can fall off easily. Even stashed in my bag, the cap parts with the flash drive."
5,Jetflash V30,This nice product ALSO works with USB 1.x - arequirement of mine and my collection of olderand new computers (I have 9 computers). Completely eliminates the hassle of moving things between all the computers.Not too many of these multi USB products exist but theJetflash line is one of them.I still use an elderly 10 year old computer usingWin 98 for most of my internet work. Did I mentionthat I'm also using Netscape 7.2 on the old girlwith only occasional internet protests.Joe O'Loughlin
1,Half Memory,This device would only let me use less than half the memory and (Digital Media Source) ripped me off for the return shipping.
1,failed within four months,I would not recommend this product. I bought one and it failed within four months of very light use. I tried it on several computers and none would recognize the drive.
1,Failure To Function In Windows 7,"I tried this drive on my Windows 7 desktop & laptop, it did not work with either.It would automatically detect the drive, attempt to install it & conclude that the drive was unknown. I search the Transcend site for a driver/software that could help the OS recognize the drive, but there was nothing.So far, complete waste of money."
3,Not for Win98,Works fine but doesn't work at all for Windows 98! Wish that had been made clearer from the beginning.
3,Did finally get the product,Could have been mailed more quickly and had to give gift over a week later. Product may be okay--I didn't have the time to test it nor the ability to see if the gift receiver liked it. I actually was going to reject the sale but later did pay for the products...
3,Great Product But To Much $$$ For Shipping,"I really like the product a lot. But almost $14 dollars for shipping something that was not even 1 lbs is way to much. When I picked up the pakcage from the Post Office, I ask the gal behind the counter how much it was to ship it and she told me it was $2.98. But all in all I amd happy with the item. Just make sure you check out what it's going to cost you for shipping. you might be able to get it cheeper in your local area."
2,The flash drive needs security backup,I tried to retrieve data and pictures that was on desktop and I could notget them back though the drive isn't working at this time.
5,This device is simply the best. And really hard to kill.,"Bought this guy two weeks ago.Its full of advantages.Size: width of usb cable, fits everywhereSpeed, capacity, no need to install.The only disadvantage is anavoidable: its easy to loose. But, due to black color, esy to find, for example at snow or sand.And also its really robust, and almost impossible to kill. Mine spend a night in the snow in the parking lot, then in the morning was overridden by couple of cars and spend time until noon in a puddle of mixture of water and show-melt chemical agent. After washing, wiping and staying in the room for an hour it found working without problems. Just a few scratches on plastic surface.Resume: nothing compares to products from transcend.Guys from Kingston and SanDisk should think about goung out of the business and switch to something less challenging."
5,Great little flash drive. Awesome price!,"The best buy you will find for a flash drive is not at Best Buy. It's at Amazon. This is a great flash drive with super ease of use. I like how Transcend color codes them, too, so that they are a little easier to track down."
5,:3,"Very nice, very elegant product. Uses standard flash chips, so don't expect any super speedy stuff. Included is a CD which installs crapware onto it to make stuff easier for idiots. One problem with the whole thing: it's so shiny, it will retain your fingerprints at the slightest touch."
2,Mediocre grammar and poor structure,"One bogus review after another. Matlock's grammar is borderline while the story structure is marginal at best. And the British syntax is not even close, according to a British friend. She said Matlock's British verbage is akin to something out of Disney.As for the historical accuracy, the HISTORICAL NOVEL REVIEW insist they have never heard of of JOE MATLOCK, nor Hilliard & Harris, whom happens to be a PRINT ON DEMAND PUBLISHER (aka vanity press!)"
3,Raises the bar on political incorrectness.,"What a sexist pig Tom is! Is this Matlock's idea of a man? Meek women and macho men, drinking and more. I'll give it three stars only because it is reputed by the Historical Novel Review to be ""well-researched"" and the historical passages are interesting. Matlock's writing is somewhat above average but it is regretful that he could not direct himself to write something more meaningful and contributary to society."
5,Author John Grisham meets Producer/Director Sam Fuller,"What if journalist/producer/director Sam Fuller (Park Row, Fixed Bayonets, Steel Helmets and BIG RED ONE) met up with Author John Grisham? You would have Joe Matlock and his novel TWILIGHT OF FURY, which presents a scandalous truth underlying war and those who struggle to survive this horror.I understand at a book signing of Matlock's that he interviewed many of those who lived at that time and set their stories with his novel. It is difficult to surpass that!If you desire to take in a World War II novel that portrays the unvarnished truth of surviving war then this is the story for you."
5,Four books for the price of one,"Like chocolates on a shelf, Twilight Of Fury tempts you to take in more. I need to say more than 'Don't miss this story,' but it's hard say anything without giving away something important!Appropriately divided into four parts, the novel's Book One begins with two separate stories. You can see the characters clearly and feel the atmosphere as the stage is set. You find yourself being towed gently by the story as it weaves its way into your heart. It's more than boy meets girl. It's another world, and another time.By Book Two- you are gripped with anticipation knowing the two will meet, but how will they react? Where will it go? Will they survive? How much more can a person take?Book Three will shock you, but you are mired too deep to get away now. The twists and turns come abruptly with a surprise. This could be anyone's life!Book Four will give you the redemption you will seek by the tales end..."
5,Book description,"Tom MacMillan has a problem. He's a womanizing coward caught in the middle of World War II as a fighter pilot. Meanwhile, British nurse Molly Master has a problem. She can't stand the Yanks, particularly Yank fighter pilots. And Tom is the epitome of what she detests most in Americans.Shoved together by circumstance, the two overcome their differences and forge a deep love fired by a desperate need to escape the horrors of war. Molly becomes Tom's first true love, a reason to fight his way home after every mission and to escape the Nazis after he is shot down over Belgium.But life is not fair and surviving an evil war is only half the conflict. . .Twilight Of Fury is a story of how relationships and terrible events change the lives of people who struggle to survive them. Where compassion, understanding and love must take a stand against hate, treachery and bitterness and discover that honor and sacrifice are the true saving graces of humanity."
4,Impressive for a mainstream drama,"I read mostly mysteries and thrillers. Dramas, particularly historical mainstream, tend to be too slow, artsy and full dull information and talk. Twilight Of Fury surprised me. Matlock wasted little on useless data and the story proved to be exciting if not, at times, a thriller. It has love interest but not romance in the strictest sense. It has military conflict but it's not a war story. It has drama but it's several notches above social ho-hum. The aerial combat is exciting and I loathe manly 'motor' books. Last part of the book was wonderfully thought out. Several men I know need to read this book; my boyfriend is one of them! Matlock's website was a little boring for my taste since I don't care about history."
5,Destined to be a classic,"Matlock tells a great story. Twilight Of Fury is so interesting, you can't stop turning pages. From page one, you'll find yourself totally engrossed. Believe me, you can read 200 pages in one sitting. I started at four in the afternoon and didn't stop until I finished at four-thirty the next morning. Twilight Of Fury is an incredible book there will always be a place for it on my bookshelf."
5,Not What I Expected...but I like it!,"This is a suprising book. It's actually quite a pleasure to read. In fact, I found the characters in this book to be more substantial and memorable than usual. A great read!"
5,"Excellent movie for lovers of Anime, story, action, great.","If you really enjoy Anime/Japanimation you'll love this movie to death. It has action of unparalelled proportions and just flat out rules all Anime movies. I watch any Anime I can get my hands on and to tell you the truth, this is the god of them all. Enjoy it folks!"
5,Gary Daniels kicks ***.,"I first saw this movie a couple of years ago at about midnight on HBO. I wasn't expecting much, but I was totally blown away by the whole post-apocalyptic world this movie creates. The fight scenes are absolutely entertaining from beginning to end. Gary Daniels does a fine job of portraying Ken, as well as his martial arts talents. He defenitly deserved to be on the big screen(watch Bloodmoon). Costas Mandylor is just plain Kuel! Okay, he isn't really a martial artist, but the final fight between him and Gary Daniels is still pretty good. Of course, Gary Daniels has to get throught about 100 of his goons to get to him, and there are a couple of good fights in there too. So if you're just into action movies for the fighting, you could do alot worse than this. At least rent it to compare it with the classic anime of the same name."
1,Remake is defentaly needed badly!,"I was excited when this came out in 1995 and saw it in Tokyo. This was my favorite Japanese comic at the time. Unfortunately, this was one of the worst adaptations I could have never imagined. Although there were a few good fight effects, it did not make up for the poor screenwriting and plot. I want to remake this film with a big actor, and all the characters needed. This could be like ""Lord of the Rings: Trilogy"". The comic is tight, and the story is deep. So please don't watch this film. Read the comic and then let your imagination soar!!!"
1,"If I could give Lower, I would!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This is the most heinous tribute to an anime feature I have ever had the sorry displeasure to ever witness. The fight scenes were mediocre, the actors were as exciting as 3 day old dish water, and the fact that they had the nerve to associate it with so venerable and revered an anime classic as the TRUE FIST, makes me wish to humbly vomit in the ajacent vacinity of these film makers. Why would Malcolm McDowell lower himself to so low an estate as to associate himself with such a slipshot production? What the hel possessed the film makers to even make it? Do they wish to insult the public?"
1,1.5 good fights,"This movie is pretty terrible, I saw it on the sci-fi channel, it's basically Cyborg. The name of this franchise proves Shakespeare's ""rose is still a rose"" quote wrong, if it was called Blood Fued or some other corny name no one would give a dang about it. The first fight Kenshiro gets into is the best, very stylized, the sparse sound effects make it more powerful. The .5 is a culmination of a combo here a kick there. Gary Daniels does this pretty wicked spinning side kick, but I have to critcize him for taking Van Dam's splits spin kick. I wouldn't even bother renting this though. Now that I think of it, I think Street Fighter was better than this."
1,Rotten Live Version of Anime Classic,"I loved the anime version of FIST OF THE NORTH STAR. But this dreadful live action knock off is ghastly. The fighting is unconvincing, the acting is truly horrible and just when you think it can't get worse Downtown Julie Brown shows up as a guerrilla fighter. Aaaaaaaargh! Only buy this if you like cheesy, poorly done martial arts camp fests and even then prepared to be bored out of your skull."
1,very poor get the animated version instead,"i have not seen a worse movie yet, the anime version was excellent i wont tell anything about the plot but trust me some things are better left animated"
2,Yet another example of good source material misused,"Yet another example of good source material, if not for interesting character interplay, then at least for good mind-numbing violence.FOTNS has it moments namely good photography and score with a couple of nifty fight sequences but falls flat with Daniels' wooden acting and overload of underdeveloped and unappealing characters.Kudos for slipping in Melvin Van Peebles. Scenes such as Daniels' Kenshiro delivering what is probably the most anticipated line for fans ""You're already dead"" turn the viewing experience into a head-scratching inner monologue questioning how many takes did Randel do and was that really the best one?An example of this east to west translation gone right will probably be Steve Norrington's adaptation of Ninja Scroll."
1,Spend as little as possible!,"If you're like me and just HAVE to see this movie because you liked the anime series, well, my advice to you is spend as LITTLE money as possible and buy this used.Like many of the other reviews you'll see here, all I can do is tell you, the acting is terrible, special effects aren't and you'll be very glad its only 90 minutes.Up side to this is if you watch this with a friend, they will hate you for it, but when they see the anime series they will be amazed how much more they like it than this movie.Good luck, if you can make it to the end, be sure to write a review and post it here too."
1,Defected design,"I liked the design, but quality is poor. The sizes of lid and tray are not matching, so that the lid is not stable when closed."
4,Suprised,"I had never listened to a Fat Joe album. My best friend kept saying it's hot. I always thought Fat Joe was commercial. Well, he ssuprised me with this one. It's gutta from start to finish. If you want something with heavy beat to ride to, this won't disappoint you. Not 5 mics, but it's still hot."
1,fat joe,"i think he should stop now this is really bad, and since when could purto ricians say the N word?"
4,Joe DOES IT,"the album is a good album.... i joe really did step it up this time.... i dont pay attention to what this Reviewer: Constant (Vancouver, BC Canada) guy has to say"
1,joey crack od please we don't wanna hear you anymore,people like fat joe and terror squad is giving hip hop a bad name and he should quit jockriding the south it does'nt fit it fat joe cd's are all crappy.
3,i love fat joe but...,"this one was dissapointing. i was a bit sad that he got to thishis first hit, ""make it rain"", is really good and i love it BUTThe rest is crap. go get All or Nothing, better album then this."
5,The Most under rated Album of the year please dont sleep on it ...,The whole cd is straight hip-hop and is worth every penny and then some... go cop it
3,Producers save your best tracks for the better rappers.........,"The production on this joint is outta here. Top notch. The problem here lies with Fat Joe himself, who has limited rhyme schemes and raps in same voice on just about every track. I will give Joe credit for hustling his way to 13 years in the business. That's his biggest acheivement, because dude is not that lyrical at all.He could go gold or plat just off Make it Rain alone, if marketed right."
1,He did a song with Paris Hilton!!!!!!!!!!!,"When will Fat Joe stop rapping? It is obvious that he struggling to pump some life into his failing career by doing songs with the most commercial artists he can find (Ja rule, Nelly, and the one that blew my mind PARIS HILTON). Fat joe now needs to do a song with the New Kids on the block, because all of his street credibility is gone. Maybe Wack Joe wouldn't suck so bad if Big Pun was still alive. This is a typical commercial album, sub par lyrics, stomach upsetting lyrics, and corny hooks. Who will Wack Joe work with next?!?!??!??!?!??! My vote is K-Fed, that collabo would be just as awesome as the one with Paris Hilton! LOL!"
1,This album is a Joke,"Don't waste your money on this album. Track number 2 is ripped off atmosphere's ""the arrival"" off his album ""you can't imagine how much fun we're having"" which dropped in 2005. Atmopshere is an Indie hip hop group who deserve the credit for this track. Fat joe is a punk and for someone as famous as he is, I would think he wouldn't rip music from other artists."
5,Beautifully illustrated Waldorf approach alphabet book.,"The most inspiring alphabet book. Waldorf style learning method. Could be an example for classroom teaching, or home schooling, or simply complement what the child is seeing in school."
4,So far so good,Odd use but I bought this pump to use as a powered dog washing station. Have a dog with a lot (!!) of hair and it usually takes me about an hour to shampoo and rinse him off so needless to say he's usually quite dirty.Got this idea to just make a power washer using a utility pump and its worked out perfectly. The pump seems to be reliable and well made. My only concern has to do with the filter and whether it would hold out hair. I couldn't find out how big the filter is so I ended up wrapping the pump with some women's pantyhose.I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others who need this type of pump.
3,surprisingly good,"I saw this and thought it was too cheap to be any good. I bought it and was pleasantly surprised.Chet plays and sings standards with an orchestra, similar to Chet with Italian strings album. He plays well and sings in tune (not always the case elsewhere). ""Autumn in New York"" is quite poignant. ""Good-bye"" is heartfelt, as is ""Angel Eyes"". Music is romantic, pop, and nonchallenging. Most songs are instrumental, a few have vocals too.The only problem I have is there is alsolutely no info in the album of when this was done, who the Len Mercer orchesta is, nothing at all. Enjoy, save money!On my tough grading system, a 4 star album, lowered one star for no album info. Recording quality is not wonderful but adequate, orchestra on right, Chet on left."
4,This fan packs alot of power!,"Considering the size and portability of this fan, it provides a lot of wind and power. This fan can be placed in two positions-- either horizontal or vertical--for your comfort. I highly recommend this fan, if you can get past the noise. (It can get pretty loud at the higher speeds.)"
5,"Very hip, very cool.","One of the best kept secrets of the 80's - If you are into funky soulful melodies, check it out. With all the crap music being spewed out these days, this one finds its way into my CD rotation alot . . ."
3,big and cheap,"This pistol looks very nice and shoots okay. It is another very inexpensive pistol from Hobbytron. It has a very large feeling in the hand. The ""laser"" sight is fun to play with cats with.Remember that this is toward the bottom of the price range for something like this and you should be okay buying it. Hobbytron has proven to be a reliable vender."
4,For Blue's Clues Fans!,"This is a simple deck of cards with pictures of characters from Blue's Clues. Each card has an action for the kids to perform. You can play a few different games with the cards.The cards are big, so its easy for little hands to hold. The cards are a bit too easy to bend. My daughter (who is almost 3 years old )likes to play memory with the cards, and its easy because each card has many duplicates. This is a cute game for Blue's Clues fans."
2,Carly Patterson,"Unless you know next to nothing about gymnastics or are under the age of 10, don't waste your time on this book - it was too simplistic for those of us who have followed the sport for 30 years."
4,This book is a staple in my kitchen.,The directions are simple and easy to follow. Recipes are in English on one side and Farsi on the other. Suggestions for substitutions are helpful.
5,persian cookbook,"This is my go to cookbook for cooking persian staples. My husband is iranian and he loves it when I cook, and I have this as a back up. It has great starters..torshi for example, which is easy to cook once you have the ingredients. i really add other things to the recipes because he likes it that way. But for any american cooking persian food for the first time, I would use this as a guide."
2,"Great, for awhile","I loved this baby monitor. The picture was clear and the unit lights up when the baby cries, so you know even if you have the sound turned off. It's a great feature.However, the monitor died after 1 year of service. I know we live in a disposable society, but I would expect a $100 baby monitor to last more than a year.Despite my appreciation for the features, I will not purchase this item again. It was poorly built."
2,"Video Works, but the sound is poor","My husband and I revceived this monitor as a shower gift and we couldn't wait to try it out. We were disappointed about a few things:1. The video part had some interferences.2. The sound was poor- especially as we brought the video part closer to the camera unit.3. BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT: The parent (video) unit always has to be plugged in with the AC adaptor- you can't use batteries- not convenient for a Mom on the go.For about 105.00 with tax, these problems were unacceptable. We returned it and bought a portable security camera from The Sharper Image- the best purchase yet!My advice- check out The Sharper Image store on ebay and you can find a similar, but better product for about $120- Believe me, it's worth it!"
2,awful awful,the only reason why I didn't return this awful monitor is because I like to see my baby. The noise/static is absolutely awful--it actually kept my husband and me up all night. Do NOT buy this product--try to find a different monitor to see your baby.
1,one word - static,"I don't usually write reviews but I use them religiously so I purchased this video monitor.Disappointing.The picture is fuzzy. That I can live with but the sound, however, is unacceptable. I cannot stand to listen to static constantly. Tune a radio to your favorite station, now tune to the next strong signal, now tune right in the middle and crank it up. That's what this thing sounds like! Further, eventually, you'll learn to ignore the loud hiss and then miss the sounds of your child. The picture's clarity is not sufficient to decipher between subtle sleeping movements and anything you might want to run frantically to check on.If you need video, get an x10 cam. There not just for {anyone} anymore"
1,Don't buy...save your money,The monitor went out after only a few months use. Summer Infant agreed to look at the monitor as long as it was within the one year period from date of purchase. The company said it was a blown fuse and said they would correct it. The fixed monitor worked for about a month before the images on the screen became distorted again. I would NOT recommend this product. Spend more money and buy a better quality monitor. It will be worth it. I am currently searching for a new camera/monitor system to replace this faulty one.
3,Good picture - no sound,I was disappointed with my purchase of this monitor. No where on the box did it give a range. On inside paperwork it stated that you will loose quality in sound and/or picture if you go beyond 60ft. I had to be 66 feet. I could see the picture pretty well but never could hear any sound - only static. Keep this in mind if you purchase this product.
3,"Yes, my TV screen failed too-12 months later & no picture!","I LOVED this monitor until about 2 weeks ago, when the picture went out on me. I have used it for 12 months. The picture in the TV screen has turned into one straight line with no visible picture. I have loved this monitor, great reception, sound, nothing negative, until now. I would have given it 5 stars had it not deteriorated. It has been so helpful in watching the baby. As a matter of fact, now I find that I can not live without a camera monitor. I am on the hunt for a new one. I guess you have to think according to all the reviews that this is a 1 year disposable model."
5,Worth the money!,My husband and I love this monitor. Our daughter is now 19 months and we have used it everyday since she was 4 months. It still works great!!
2,A Better Monitor,"I have not bought this monitor but read all of the mixed reviews online. Due to this, I searched on the Radio Shack web site and found a video monitor which is much better. It is called the ""2.4GHz Black & White Wireless Surveillance System."" The ones on Babies R Us are only 900mHz. The Radio Shack model is supposed to have a crisp, clear image, a microphone, and even works in total darkness. It costs $120 and like the Summer model, has no wires or hookup. You can even add up to 4 cameras."
1,Summer is Junk!- Save time and frustration- Get GE 2.4GHZ,"This monitor is nothing but junk! I bought this and returned it because it was so bad. The reception, all over our house, was so bad you couldn't tell what you were looking at. You cannot use the sound part because the scratchy noise from the horrible reception. Save your time and money. Go to Lowe's and get the GE 2.4GHZ system. You can even buy one that hooks up to your TV ($150) so you don't have to have another bulky TV type monitor sitting around. You can add up to 3 cameras to one adapter so if you have more than one child you can watch all of them on your own TV. It costs a little more, but is very worthwhile. The reception is fabulous day or night. It's great to lie in bed and be able to switch to the channel your monitor is on and check your child while watching TV. There isn't any sound to the GE unit, however I wouldn't by this Summer one for sound anyway, we have a separate, better monitor for sound. Good luck!"
3,1stTimeMom,"We received this monitor as a gift, and it works pretty well. I like the convenience of using it in the kitchen after I've put the baby to bed. I gave this product only 3 stars because the sound quality is not as good as our regular audio monitor. At night, I use my audio monitor, and I'll turn on the video monitor if I hear the baby stirring."
4,Great idea!,I wanted to get a video monitor since i have a 2 year old and expecting another shortly. I wanted the 2 camera version but we had too much feedback in the sound and video. We purchased this one and the safety 1st to see which one we liked better and we decided to go with this one. The picture isn't as clear as i hoped but i think there is something in my house that is causing the problem. We tried the safety 1st and the picture was very clear in the daytime but at night we couldn't even see a thing on the screen. I would recommend this item just because i like knowing what my child is doing in bed when the door is closed.
1,Loved it...until it broke ;(,"This was by far my favorite and one of the most useful baby ""gadgets"" I received. I recommended it to everyone and thought I could never live without it. HOWEVER, just days before I was going to buy a 2nd monitor for my 2nd child, my first one broke (after less than 16 mo.) The monitor just has a line down the middle. I am so disappointed. I don't know what I'm going to get to solve this. Just wanted to warn people that this product will not last long."
3,Sound is Terrible!,"The picture is absolutely perfect, and I love being able to check in on our daughter at night. However, the interference is terrible! We ended up just turning off the sound and opening up the doors hoping we could hear her. Pretty unsatisfactory for a monitor... If anyone knows how to fix the interference, please help!"
1,Potential Hazard,"I bought this monitor from Babies R Us and immediately had to return it. It did not work straight out of the box. Believing this to be a fluke, I exchanged it for the same model. This one worked well for about 6 months and then the AC adaptor cracked in half (we presume from the heat that the adaptor was generating) ??? We were alarmed by this but bought a new adaptor. After having the monitor for a little over a year, it just ""gave out"". No picture, no sound, etc. We contacted the company whose warranty expired at one year. Overall, this is an expensive product to have so many problems. I am sure there are better alternatives!"
1,Very disappointed with this monitor,"We purchased this monitor so that we would be able to watch our baby at night. When we hooked it up, we noticed that the top third of the monitor screen was messed up (fuzzy, distorted lines). So we exchanged it for the same monitor. The new monitor does not have the distorted lines, but it will not work in our bedroom. After hours of trying to adjust it and reposition it, we were still unable to use it in our bedroom, which of course defeats the entire purpose of having it. Unfortantely, we are going to return it and look for a better monitor."
4,Well worth the money,"I got the Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor as a baby shower gift. When I registered for it I thought it was silly because we had already registered for the audio monitor. However, my husband ""had to have it"" for the baby so we added it anyway. I got it as a baby gift and thank God I did. My son just turned 13 months and we finally sleep through the night! He sleeps in his nursery and we sleep in our room because I am able to see that he is only crying and will soon return to sleep. So, I don't even go in the room. I simply watch on the monitor until he falls asleep again and then I return to sleep. I'm getting more sleep now than I have in a year!! You need to get this video monitor."
3,Pay a little more for a better picture.,"We bought this video monitor after our daughter turned one. I didn't think I would need it with having the voice monitor, but it was nice to see what she was doing at bed times.I could also see when she woke up without opening the door and disturbing her.(door closed due to cat)We thought it was great. I like the easy on and off video button at the top and the sound is very clear and loud. It also lit up the crib at night which was kind of nice also. It was just enough light, like a nite lite. The down fall was the clicking noise constantly. So we decided to try the Safety 1st brand($50 more)Wow the picture was sooo much clearer. No constant clicking. Not as easy to switch video off and the sound is not as loud as I would like it to be but for a better picture it's worth paying a little more, plus you have a tv to boot."
2,too much static,Picture is fair but the static is terribile. Noise from the receiver would keep many people awake during the night. I am going to try the 2.4 mhz to see if it is any better.
1,Sleepless,"I bought this item because of reading the reviews on how awesome it was. Well let me tell you, it is a waste of money. The picture is fuzzy and i cant even hear my baby since all you hear is fuzz. I was scared having the baby sleep in her room and when i bought this item i thought it would help. I have not slept since i purchased this item and now have the baby in the portable crib beside me. save your money on this product because it's not worth it. i am going to try the safety one instead."
3,Be careful!!,"This monitor is a wonderful choice in terms of clarity of sound and picture. However, be very careful not to drop the TV monitor because it is much more fragile than you might expect. I broke two of them within a one year span before giving up and getting a regular monitor. This is especially important advice for those with toddlers running around."
4,Great idea,This is a great idea for those of you out there like myself that are super paranoid about their child. The picture can be kind of fuzzy and if you have a celing fan with remote control it can interfere with it. Otherwise its very nice and we use it every night and day.
5,Helps put your worries at ease,I really love my Summer Video monitor! I am a first time mother of a 16 month old and it has helped me sleep at night. We did have a bad monitor with the one that was given to us originally but the company stood by their product and sent us a new one which has worked great! Perfect for the mom or dad who worries!
1,This monitor is very bad,"I bought this monitor and I couldn't see the entire image on the display. It requires two people on both rooms to adjust the antenna. So, if you take the monitor to another room and you are alone, for example, you have to go back and forward a 100 times until you have a quality image. There's also a background noise. I already returned, but there's a cost for it. Don't waste your money!!! It's true!!!"
4,"So far, so good!","We first had another monitor from a different company, it went dead. We love this monitor so far (knock on wood.) You never know how these things will go. We could not live without one of these monitors though. If it broke, I would buy another one. We use it that much. In fact, we have a tele. monitor in our bedroom, and bought another monitor for the livingroom. We love it!"
2,The Monitor(TV screen) is not good quality,"I bought this monitor because I liked the fact it was a video. I loved it from the moment I brought it home and started using it.But suddenly the screen stopped working. I contacted the company and they said I could send it to them and they would try to fix it. And if it had been under 1 year since the date of purchase I would get a new one for free, if it could not be repaired, otherwise I'd have to pay for a new monitor(just the TV part). Unfortunatly, it had been just over a year, so I just opted to buy a whole new monitor set. Well, that was less than 2 months ago and my NEW monitor screen is just about DEAD!! I am furious!! My sister in law said she had the same problem with hers. So I am returning my monitor this weekend and getting a different brand....hopefully I won't have the same problem."
2,17 Months of use before the Monitor stopped functioning...,"There is another review that states they got 15 months before the monitor stopped working. We were able to get 17 months of use before the monitor stopped functioning altogether. No sound, no video, no nada.To be fair, my wife did take the monitor from room to room, so it had it's share of handling. But it was never dropped or jossled too heavily to cause the monitor to just stop working one day. I am disappointed and will look at getting a replacement that is a non-Summer brand."
2,Love It - Hate It!,"We purchased this video system about 10 months ago and have used it daily. While the picture is not super clear, it is sufficient for baby monitoring and works especially well at night.That's the good news. The bad news is that the monitor just burned out with less than 10 months use. By the time you figure repair costs, the only way to fix it is to buy a new unit."
4,Peace of mind beats the problems,"We received this monitor as a shower gift and I love having it for peace of mind. When my daughter was a newborn I could take the monitor with me to any part of the house and see her. Now it is in our room and we only turn it on if she wakes in the middle of the night but it is nice to know I can see that she is o.k.. With that being said, the sound is terrible so we don't use the volume since she is right down the hall anyway, the visual is actually pretty good on ours but it has a horrible bright light so we keep it turned slightly away so we can sleep. We are expecting another baby and will probably buy another camera to watch different rooms."
4,Really happy...,"With twin babies and a toddler in our house, we were looking for a means to keep an eye on everyone throughout the day. We actually don't use this to monitor the babies' sleep, but to watch our toddler playing. We bought the package with two cameras. We currently have one camera set up in the playroom and the other in our family room. The tv monitor is in our home office. Although one channel doesn't work at all for us, the other two channels work nearly perfectly with little interferance. The only issue is when we use the office phone, which is 900 mhz and is right next to the monitor. Other than that, we have no problems. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is I wish the camera had a wider view. Still, I can see enough of the rooms to get an idea of what's going on and I can hear what I can't see. I feel much better now knowing that everyone is safe while I'm in the office working."
1,"no picture, poor audio","We received it as a shower gift. We then followed the instructions to attempt to optimize the performance using all combinations of options available. No matter what we did, it's way way below our expectation - basically, there's close to no picture and the audio is too bad. We couldn't believe a product with such a low (or no) quality could be available in the market. We wondered if it was just a defective item so we tried to have it replaced online but were told that it's not available from the supplier. Not sure if our item (n=1) can represent the product but if it does, stay away from it!"
2,Great Video Poor Audio,"Night vision works good. Interference was a problem. I moved the camera and the monitor in over a dozon places, but still had static. No problem with the picture, just the sound. I returned it. The handheld color version is much better, but more expensive."
4,It works,"We just received this monitor, and it works quite well in our small house. The black and white picture, while not DVD-quality video is certainly adequate to see the baby. The monitor itself is small and light. The camera has a built-in infra-red LED light bank and allows you to see the baby in complete darkness. The audio, however, does have a buzz to it which is why I have taken off one star."
5,Love it!,Our daughter is 13 months now and I still love this monitor. I can go to bed in peace when I can see her sleeping so sound.
1,Junk,"This unit dose not have the range that the manufacture claims it has(300'), and the background noise is terible. Don't waste your money on this unit or the Safety 1st unit. Go to Lowe's (Home Improvment Warehouse)and get the 2.4 GHz Sylvania for $100."
1,very disappointed,"I had the Safety 1st monitor and broke it, so I decided to try this one since it was cheaper. The info said that it would work up to 60 feet away. The distance we had it was less than 50 feet and all I could get was a fuzzy picture and loud static. Even though there was no noise in the room, there was a lot of static. After 2 nights of hearing the static I brought it back and spent the extra money for another Safety 1st monitor, which comes in beautifully."
1,BUYERS BEWARE,"All of our expectations went out the window when we plugged in this baby monitor system. The poor quality of the video and the sound in itself, is enough to keep a person awake all night, but to exasperate the situation further we really don't know what is going on with our infant daughter because of continuous visual and audio static and this too keeps up hoping to her room to check on her. It would have been better to go with an old-fashioned audio baby monitor than to have wasted our (budgeted) money on this system. We are very perplexed that others have found this monitor invaluable; we have found it to be worthless. Buyers beware."
3,Worked well for a while,"We started using this monitor when my son was about 3 months old. It worked really well for a few months. Then the picture quality kept getting worse and worse, despite trying to change locations, etc. Now after about 9 months of using it, the picture tube must have gone bad because we can't get a picture at all, just a black screen. The sound has always been only OK, so we used a regular monitor for sound. Very disappointed that this doesn't work anymore because we got used to having it."
2,Baby monitor,"Safety 1st is more expensive then this monitor but it's well worth the money because this monitor is terrible I have to put the camera on top of my son to be able to see anything, the image is terrible and the light from the camera is way too bright, the only thing good about it is the sound."
2,Dont waste your money.........,"We got baby's Quiet Sounds Video monitor last week as a gift and i was excited abt it specially after reading all the 5 star reviews of this product. When we tried it out the picture was shaky and not so clear. Also, it was impossible to slightly increase the volume (due to high pitched static) even after unplugging all wireless and turning off everything.It is certainly not suitable for an apartment use, maybe it works better in bigger homes. We returned it immediately and got the Sony-27 channel audio monitor instead....and i have to say tht me and my husband are amazed by how crystal clear it is (with everything else in the house plugged in)....Sony has really given quality to their monitor."
4,Check in on baby.,I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. My second daughter wants one too. It nice to be able to check on baby when baby makes sounds especially at night.
2,Too Sensitive,"We received this Monitor as a shower gift, having included it in the registry because of the high reviews. Well the first one wouldn't work at all, the monitor was broken. The second one worked but the picture popped and jumped way too much and this was after 10 minutes of moving and adjusting the monitor and antenna. The sound included a great deal of static, and the pops and screachs matched the jumping picture. We knew we couldn't take a day of this let alone 15 minutes so we brought it back for a simple no picture type. Unless you live in the woods and use no other electronic devices we suggest you skip this one."
3,Puts too much light on the baby!!,"I bought this product for my second son because we loved our Safety 1st video monitor but after 3 years and much use, it was breaking down. I loved the features on this monitor however, it lights the baby up to much. I like a dark room and this monitor does not have the infared sensors that the other monitor has. Worth the $50 extra bucks to get it. If that doesn't bother you, then get this monitor. Great feature to be able to shut the video off at night."
5,AWESOME!,"We moved into a two-story home, and this really saves me the 500 trips up the stairs at night. The sound is great, and you don't get that bad feedback sound like with other models. Also, the picture is GREAT!"
5,This this the ONLY advice I have for new parents!,"Truthfully, I hated the part of being pregant that was getting all kinds of advice. I promised myself not to be like that after I had my baby. However, I can't pass up the opportunity to REALLY SUGGEST getting THIS video monitor. It is so nice to be able to look at the baby without taking the chace of disturbing him. When he was first born it made me feel like I was with him - even thought I was not. On the very practical side - We love it so much in our 2 bedroom condo, I can only imagine the peace of mind in a house. It is especially nice now that he is rolling because I can see if he has rolled into a corner or has his face covered by a blanket. My friend still uses hers with her 4 year old to see what she is doing while playing in her room. She has a second one for her 2 year old. It is not that much more than a regular one and worth EVERY penny."
1,Disappointed & Disgusted,"What a waste of good money. We received this monitor as a shower gift. I'd registered for it based on the same glowing reviews you've read here. Stupidly, I waited several months, (until we were ready to move our baby out of our room into the nursery) to hook everything up. The reception is unbeliveably poor. We live in a 1 story, 4 bedroom house with 3 cordless phones. Thinking the phones might be causing our bad reception, I disconnected them all. We found this made absolutely no difference. No matter what channel, or which camera, or room I tried, nothing seemed to work. At last, I hooked the monitor up in the hallway directly outside the baby's room, and managed to get a constantly rolling, grainy view of the crib. The static was horrible. We will be donating this and buying something more worthwhile - like a $19.99 set of Fisher Price audio monitors."
2,Very Disappointed,"My husband and I thought that this would be a great way for us to keep an eye on our newborn but we soon found out that it was not. We could not get a clear picture on the video monitor and we could only pick up static when we tried to use the sound monitor. We tried everything from moving both the monitor and the camera and switching channels, nothing worked."
3,worked for awhile,"This monitor was a gift from my registry. It worked for a little while, then the picture on the video screen wouldn't leave after the video was shut off. I contacted the company and they sent me another monitor. The customer service was great, which is why I'm giving this product 3 stars. The new monitor was worse than the other one. I couldn't get a picture in whatsoever and the monitor and transmitter were in the same spot as the last one. I would've been better off keeping the old one, at least the picture came in OK. I had purchased the safety first monitor for $20 while this monitor was sent back to the company, and it works great. Granted, its only audio, but my daughter's room is right down the hall and I found that I didn't miss the video while waiting for the new monitor. So, I returned the new one because it didn't work."
2,Worked in the beginning,I have bought two of these monitors. With my first child it lasted about 3 months until the screen no longer worked. I tried to return it but since someone bought it for me so early in my pregnancy I could not return it. Next we bought the duel receiver. This one lasted about one year until the screen yet again went out and now we can only get sound. With our third child on the way we will not buy this monitor again. I can't imagine spending the money only to have to replace it. For that type of money it should last for years.
2,Not so pleased with Summer Infant,"After approximately 8 months of use, my Summer Infant video monitor began distorting the picture to the point where you could not make out what you were seeing on the monitor. I called Summer Infant and they said they would correct the problem as long as it had not been over one year since date of purchase. The company called me about a week after I shipped the camera & monitor to them and told me the fuse had blown in the monitor and it had been corrected. The corrected monitor worked fine for a couple of months until the picture became distorted again. The camera has given us no problems whatsoever, only the monitor. I am currently looking for another brand as a replacement."
2,Better for a Playroom_not for baby room,"This Monitor is our 2nd picture Monitor. Compared to our previous (broken) monitor, the picture itself is perfectly clear during the night & day. However the static is constant no matter what room we move the monitor to. As long as the volume is on the lowest setting, it reduces the static tremendously. Then we can just barely hear baby, sometimes not at all. We must rely on the flashing red lights to tell whether or not our baby is crying. This monitor would be better for a playroom instead of a baby room."
3,Bad Picture,"I registered for and received this as a shower gift. I thought it would be great. However, I could not get a clear picture. Mind you, I was not looking for crystal clear, but clear enough to see my son. I returned this and bought the Safety 1st monitor. We had the same problems with that one. I believe we have too much interference in our home. My husband is very big into electronics and we have 4 cordless phones. Although a wonderful idea, this one just didn't work out for us."
4,I Love It!!,"Had a safety 1st moinitor for three years until it accidently fell and broke, went shopping for new monitor and bought this model because of the cheaper price, and it is so much better than safety 1st. With the safety first model I was NEVER able to use the sound because of way too much static, but this model has EXCELLENT sound and picture. Thank you so much for the great product, and the cheaper price."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I usually do not write reviews (good or bad), but I am so fed up with this monitor that I had to save someone else the money and frustration. This video monitor is horrible! The monitor is CONSTANTLY full of static. It doesn't matter how far or how close it is from the base, there is never a time when there isn't static. I thought the purpose of the volume was to hear your child, but it is impossible to hear your child over the static. We finally had to just turn the volume down and constantly keep our eye on the video monitor. That is the only way we could tell if he (our child) needed us or not. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
2,i wouldn't waste my money...,"We bought this monitor as my husband HAD to have it as he though it was SO cool. However, we have been very disapointed with it. The picture is not very clear especially at night, the receiver is very loud, and the green light that you have to shine at the baby is quite bright and would wake me up! We ended up buying an audio-only monitor and really like it-plus it was cheaper--I'm selling our video monitor on ebay now.!"
2,Not what I thought,"This was a shower gift and I was so excited to get it. But right from the beginning I noted that it was an inferior product. The picture left much to be desired and the interference was horrible. I could've lived with the substandard picture but the lack of clarity in sound transmission was absolutely unacceptable to me. I went online and read the reviews just to make certain that it wasn't just me before I returned it. In reading the reviews the Sony monitor kept getting mentioned, so I tried it and WOW--What a difference!! So, I don't have a ""video"" monitor but the sound quality of the Sony more than makes up for it."
1,The Worst Moniter EVER!,"After reading the reviews we decided to purchase this moniter over the others. It was always blurry,andd the video would disappear. 2mnths later the video portion would not work at all. We thought it was a fluke purchased the same one and within 3mnths it did the same thing. We returned it and purchased the Safty first and have never been happier... Don't waste your money on this one..."
5,Love this product!,"I already had a monitor but I really wanted a video monitor. I have a six month old that rolls all over in her crib and this would allow me to check on her without going in and disturbing her. After I read some of the reviews and talked to some people on my birth club board I decided I'd try this out. I bought it at Toy R Us knowing they have a good return policy just in case. Well, brought it home, hooked it up, and I think it's amazing! The picture is incredible, even in pitch black! I will say that the sound get's screachy if you turn it up to high, but that's not what I bought it for. I bought if for the video image and it's awesome. I'd say try it out and if it doesn't work for you then you can always take it back."
1,Hit and miss product,"I bought this item before reading the reviews on it and I regret doing so. It has been two days and already the video has stopped working. No matter where we place it, it will not work. We have checked and rechecked the settings and still no picture. The sound works.....but I could have paid a lot less for a traditional baby monitor."
3,Failed after twelve months exactly,"Our monitor went out after exactly twelve months of use. We went out and bought the same item (or so we thought) for our next child. But the newer model now has horrible static. But we live on a military base, so that is probably the reason.I am on the hunt for a new monitor, because this is a must-have in parenting!!!"
2,Did not work but might work in other homes.,I read the reviews on this product before buying it. It seems it worked for some wonderfully and not so great for others or not at all. The sound worked great but I could never get a picture at all. I took it back to the store and they said certain brands dont work in certain homes. I thought about exchanging it for another just like it but figured it wouldnt work. I saw the safety first one and it was slightly higher in price but i knew my other regular monitor was safety first and it worked so I bought it and got it home and it worked fine. If you want this monitor I suggest trying it out for yourself in your home instead of just reading these reviews because it does depend on how your house is set up just dont get your hopes up and be prepared to run back to the store to exchange just in case.
2,Great for while it lasts.,"I loved this monitor when I first received it. I think it lasted 6 months for me. I could watch my little one while he slept, especially when I had to let him cry himself to sleep. I knew if he was falling asleep. But I could never get a great reception the antennae would never stay in place it kept falling over. And then the adaptor plug would get really hot and I dropped the plug once on carpet and it just shattered I had to duck tape it back together and then all of a sudden my picture wouldn't come on any longer. So now I am back to my old listening monitor. I am going to write to the company and see if I can get it fixed. Its so sad that this great monitor was made so poorly. I don't even think I would waste the money on this. Wait and hope the company improves it first."
1,buyer beware,"This product worked beautifully for the first seven months. Then the picture went out. I tried contacting (...) for weeks and finally got through by the third week. They charged me another (...) and sent out a replacement monitor. When the monitor arrived, three weeks later, I immediately connected it only to find that the reception was horrible. I now had a monitor that worked without sound. Upon inspection of the replacment, I found that it seemed to have been previously repaired. (...)"
1,Poor Quality,"The poor reviews for this product are dead on. We rec'd this monitor as a gift and we are extremely dissapointed. As I write this, I have the monitor on the baby--in the very next room--and although the pictures is fairly clear, the static is so loud that you can't hear the baby. The visual works from about20 - 30' away tops. Anything more than that and forget it. Don't even think about trying to watch baby from the family room while he/she is sleeping in his/her crib--unless of course the family room is right next to the room. Bottom line, this monitor is poor quality and basically totally worthless."
5,great product,we just purchased this product after using the safety first video monitor for 18 months. this monitor is great no interference from the microwave or from the cordless phone. with the safety first monitor we couldnt use the microwave while using the monitor the picture would get all fuzzy and the sound was horrible. I highly recommend this monitor. we are expecting another addition to our family in september and i will be buying another for the new baby.
4,security,We are able to keep an electronic eye on the baby when necessary...the audio and video are great!
2,Can you see me now?,"Not a great investment, I spent a lot of time squinting, trying to make out where my baby was. Half the time I was staring at his stuffed animal thinking it was him! Do not waste your money on this, wait until technology has advanced a little more in this field."
3,big monitor black and white screen,"I bought this product before my daughter was born. I took it out to play with it to see how it worked in light and dark rooms. The picture was clear enough to see the baby move around and the sound worked great (I experimented with my 6 month old nephew) The monitor was large and heavy, not something you would want to carry around. I believe it did have options for battery or a/c power. I finally decided I wanted something that was smaller and in color that you could plug into the TV. So I took it back and upgraded to the Summer's color baby monitor which also very well and I am very happy with. The sound had very little to no static in it for my house, which I do not have anything else that works on 900mhz here."
2,Broke after 13 months of use...,Dissappointed that the monitor blew after 13 months of use. Was WELL taken care of and only used at night. Monitor started rolling...then sparks from the back... then died! Won't purchase this one again for our second baby.
1,So disappointed...,"The first monitor, right out of the box, didn't work. I took the monitor back and exchanged it for a new one. For the first few months it worked, OK (I'd say about two months). We always had interference from our cordless phone, but that wasn't a big deal. From then on the monitor has been terrible. There is constant interference, from what I have no idea. It is so noisy with static. And when you turn the monitor on for the first time for the night, for about five minutes there is just a black screen with a white line going down the middle. After it finally tunes in the picture, the static continues. If you are going to spend the money, you might as well spend a little more and get a better quality video monitor."
4,Baby Cam's Mommy Gets A Good Night's Sleep,"Our master bedroom is on the main floor of our home while our son sleeps upstairs. During his first two months, he slept beside me in his bassinet. I would practically sleep with my hand in the bassinet. Many nights I would sleep sitting up with the baby in my arms. When we decided to move him upstairs, we purchased the Summer Video Monitor to supplement the audio monitor that we already had. That was the best decision ever. Although the picture is not crystal clear, we are able to see if he is awake or we can watch his little stomach rise and fall as he breathes. Also, the audio component is so sensitive that we can hear the slightest change in his breathing pattern. We no longer need the other monitor. I definitely recommend this product to others."
4,Great Product but doesn't last long,"Add me to the list of people that love this product, but are disappointed that it doesn't last long. My monitor died out of the blue after just 12 months. I want another monitor but will definitely look for a different brand."
1,Maybe you can monitor the baby in the same room,"Interferes with lots of other things (mobile phones?) and the image is unusable half of the time. Add to this the fact that it's dead if used at more than 10 meters (and 1-2 walls between) and even if there is no sound at all, the thing has some permanent background noise and hisses and pops that makes it unusable as audio monitor too. (it should have had some sensibility adjustment or ""transmit only when something happens"" feature?)The only good thing is the sound strength indicator but it's a bit expansive if that's all you can use."
2,"Works great...until it breaks, and it will.","I used this monitor for about 14 months, and it worked very well. But sure enough, once outside the one year warranty, the picture shrunk on the monitor and it no longer works. I found out the the exact same thing happened to a friend's unit that was approximately the same age. The company will repair it for $50, which is certainly not worth it considering I already paid $100 for a 14-month lifespan.I would recommend not cheaping out and buying something of better quality (which is what I am doing to replace this). I've had a 5"" Zenith B&W; TV for 22 years that still works, so I can't see why the picture should go out after 14 months on this thing. No excuse but poor quality."
5,Quality and Value,"My wife and I have had this monitor for two years. We use it every nap time and at bedtime through the night. It's great. Reception is clear and audio is great. Our son is now 2 years old and we still use it. We have a new born now and we are purchasing a second monitor system. Highly recommended when comparing the price, reception, amount of time we use it, and its reliability. I am a frequent Amazon buyer and a hard sell my nature. I am an engineer by profession and for this product, I give it 5 stars because of the comfort we get by keeping an eye on our little ones."
1,frustrating,"The concept is great - however after 6 months, the video image no longer works... what is the point - any baby monitor will do what this does now..."
1,You get what you pay for!!!,"This item is junk!!!!!!!!!!!! The sound is fine, but the picture is TERRIBLE. Spend a little more money and get a better quality monitor."
1,Poor Reviews are Dead On,"We have been through two monitors so far and both have become so hot we have had to unplug them as they were a fire hazard. To make matters worse, when the monitors were on the audio and visual was so poor they were useless. We have made several attempts to contact the manufacturer, however all the recordings say they are having trouble with their phone lines. I imagine it is because the call volume is so high with complaints on this item. Do yourself a favor and look at another monitor as well as a manufacturer that cares about how their customers are treated."
5,Worth every cent!,I wished I had bought this monitor when my 4 year old was born. Now we have one for my daughter and it is great. I don't need to keep the sound up because her room is next to ours. I don't have to keep hopping out of bed now to check on her. I just look at the monitor and see that she's fine. I do turn the volume up when I don't see her move to hear her breath but I don't keep it up because it does have some static and she is a noisy sleeper. Then I wouldn't get any sleep! This monitor is worth every cent and more to me. It's a comfort to me to know that I can see my beautiful daughter whenever I want and know that she is safe. You won't be sorry with this purchase. I should have another camera for my active 4 year old! The $100 is worth the piece of mind.
2,Good quality but poor performance,"The quality of the unit is done well, but the performance was much worse than I anticipated. The monitor operates on the 900 MHZ band, which is used by many devices. The camera was on the second story of our house, and the video monitor was in our bedroom on the first floor about 45 feet away. We also have wireless LAN and wireless phones (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz). Regardless of how much I adjusted antennas and channel settings, the picture and sound quality was very poor. The sound always had a large amount of interference even at very low volume levels. I would not recommend using this product unless the camera and monitor were very close together and other wireless interference was limited. There are higher frequency monitors, so I may try one of those next.The infrared picture worked well - you could see fairly well even though the room had almost no light."
1,I am so disappointed,"I was really excited about this monitor. My Safety First monitor broke because we are the clumsiest parents on the face of this earth and have dropped it a bunch of times. After 18 months the thing finally broke. We received this monitor at a baby shower for our second baby. When I turned it on, I was so disappointed to see that it did not compare to the safety first monitor at all. The picture is grainy and so is the sound. There was no way I would be able to sleep with the noise. The next day I returned it to the store and bought another Safety First monitor. Hopefully we will be more careful with it this time."
4,Could not live without it!!!,"Just bought this monitor after our son was diagnosed with seizures. It is wonderful. Our neighbors have the safety first video monitor and it isn't as nice as this one and this one is $50 cheaper. The picture is clear, after it warms up and gets focused. The great thing about this is that it is so portable. You can move the monitor where ever you are or move the camera to watch the kids in other rooms. It is GREAT!! Don't know how I lived without it. Thanks for a great product."
2,Broadway Lights,"Although I could see and hear my child, the camera shines a fairly bright light in the crib. This light disrupted my baby's sleep pattern for several nights (I was hoping he would get use to it). I returned the product"
4,Nicole from New York,"I read some of the reviews and I too am a new mom who held on to the bassinet as long as possible. This monitor has a clear picture. Some of the reviews state ""too noisy"" well then lower the volume. I have no trouble with interference. Also another review stated this product didn't have infra-red to see in the dark. NOT TRUE!! I think this is a great product and would recommend it to anyone. It is also $50 or more less than the Safety 1st monitor"
1,this monitor is horrible!!!,"This is by far the worst monitor created. From day one it has never worked correctly. Rather than giving us piece of mind at night, we are constantly playing with the antenna trying to get a picture on the screen. the camera is only down the hall maybe 25 feet from the monitor and still works poorly. Add that to the uncontrollable background static and you have all the ingredients to a sleepless night...."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I received the Summer Infant Video Monitor as a baby shower gift in August 2002. When we first started using the product, I wrote to their customer service complaining about the static that was keeping us up at night. They told us to keep the monitor away from electrical appliances, etc. We tried this, it didn't work. After ten months of use, the monitor broke. The picture turned to snow and then the monitor died. It was never dropped or mishandled in any way. I wrote to them again to let them know that I was extremely disappointed that such an expensive monitor caused so many problems in such a short amount of time. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
1,Junk,"this unit dose not have the range that the manufacture claims it has, and the background noise is terible. Don't waste your money on this unit or the Safety 1st unit. Go to Lowe's and get the 2.4 GHz Sylvania for $100."
1,Not worth 10.00,"If my room was next to my daughter's room, I'm sure that the picture would be clear and so would the sound. However, I am in a split floor plan house with the bedrooms over 60 feet apart (that's why I needed a video monitor). The picture is fuzzy. I can see the outline of my daughter. I know that she is moving, but can't tell if her face is facing down or up. Most of the time I can't hear because of the fuzziness. I had to hook my regular baby monitor in so that I could sleep. I don't recommend it to anyone (unless you're ten feet away). I plan to get something else."
1,Terrible video and reception,"I have ben using the Safety 1st video monitor for over a year and LOVE it. My 14 month old got a hold of the camera and broke it so I sent my husband out to buy another one. He accidentaly came back with this monitor, but I figured I'd use it because it did have the video feature. I've had it for exactly 5 days now and I don't like it at all. I must say that the sound is wonderful, but the video is very poor in comparison to the Safety 1st monitor - and that's when it works. For the past 2 days, during my son's nap, the monitor will not work. All I get is static. This monitor is terrible and I recommend to anyone who wants a safe and reliable video monitor, to go spend the extra $50.00 for the Safety 1st version."
1,Very Disappointed,"Great concept but needs tons of work! The video portion works great, I got a great picture. HOWEVER, the audio was completely useless due to the ""popping"" noise. I also tried moving away from everything electrical and nothing worked. I gave up and returned it."
2,Thank You,I just wanted to thank everyone for all there reviews on the summer infant monitor. It really helped me to know witch monitor to get my brother and sister in- law for there first child.All the different review here on amazon help out. It's nice to know what people think of the different things they buy.thank you Amazon for having this section and for everyone that adds something too it.Tonya
1,Bunch of fuzz,This monitor is horrible. I just put my daughter in her crib tonight for the first time. She is three months old. All I see is fuzz and all I hear is static. It makes me dizzy just looking at the thing. With all the technology out there can't they come out with something better. This will not help me get a good nights sleep because i'll be checking up on her all night long. I only give it one star because I can hear her making noise if she gets up.
1,This thing stinks,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT....If have a cordless phone, a microwave, or intend to walk in front of it. The picture stinks the sound is awful and it's an all around piece of junk."
4,It Does the Job!,"We bought this monitor about one month ago. We can hear and see my daughter clearly. If it does not work in the future as I have read in another review. It will be returned and I will get the money back even if that means that the whole toy store will her my voice.It should last, you should beable to get your moneys worth. We will see!"
1,I got the ST Dupont lighter but it's fake,I got the lighter about 2 month ago it's already not working cause it's fake Dupont . I don't know what to do with this does any one know what can I do for this? I'm so regretted
4,Great collection of short western tales,"Mr L'Amour did a terrific job with this collection of short stories. Plenty of wild characters roaming around, fair amount of blazing Colts and Winchesters and some nice interaction of personal emotions and actions. Worth reading if you are getting back into westerns like myself.Four cactus for this critter.Crunch Hardtack"
3,E. Pluribus Unum,"I purchased this cassette back in 1987, because of the hit song ""I Still Believe."" Unfortunately it was the only really good song on the whole cassette. I really enjoyed her ""original"" version of this song. After some research I learned that Mariah Carey was actually one of her back-up singers on this recording. Mariah re-released it later, after launching her solo career. I prefer Brenda K. Starr's version but Mariah didn't hurt it too bad."
3,"Readable, but the characters are a bit too well defined.","I enjoyed the book (it's a good light read), but a lot of it was beating about the bush. The book did get better towards the end. I wonder if it was the writer's first book? Certainly his ""North of South"" was better written."
1,Don't buy this product,I love playing pinball. When I bought my new computer I ordered TOTAL PINBALL 25. Boy am I sorry I spent so much as a dime on this product. It totally sucks. There is absolutely not realism to this computer game at all. I've seen much better.
3,catchy,"I'll be honest, I haven't heard the whole CD yet, but our local college radio station (WRAS Atlanta, the voice of Georgia State University) played a portion of it - including ""Sweet home Buenos Aires"" and I thought it was pretty kickin. It's a bit more musically mature than past Charly Garcia work. Providing not just a catchy tunes, but real ""music"". I recomend it."
1,You get what you pay for and this is cheap,"I ordered both this and volume II and ended up returning both. The printing was poor and difficult to read--the worst I have seen in any edition of printed music. The music was skewed on the page and parts looked distorted. The paper looked cheap too. Urtext aside, even my Schirmer edition is better, in terms of readability. I not only would never buy these again, I would think twice about buying any Kalmus edition.For about $50 I bought the Henle edition, which is just beautiful and a pleasure to read. (This is not snobbery but the superior print quality simply improves my ability to learn these pieces.) This is a lifetime investment so it doesn't pay to go cheap."
1,Unreadable drivel,"Of the dozens of books I have read about the Beatles, both individually and as a group, this is one of the most glaring examples of unreadable drivel I have seen. Another reviewer lauds this book for not containing any factual errors, when, in fact, it contains many, all easily verifiable through other reliable sources. Sandford's writing style is obnoxiously self-absorbed and annoying, and his reviews and opinions of the Beatles' music are totally unnecessary and expendable. There is little here that hasn't been hashed over dozens of times in other, better books. I opened this book with high hopes, but closed it with a sense of sad disappointment."
1,Awful,"This snide little book purports to be pro-McCartney, while digging up every nasty little rumor and innuendo ever spoken by a ""source.""Taking the tone of a knowing insider (we get the drift when he first mentions ""Eppy,"" the Beatles' nickname for Brian Epstein, and used as though the author were ""Eppy's"" best friend, EWWW), the author unaccountably starts the book in 1980 when Paul was detained in Japan for possessing marijuana. Then it jumps around, meanders, uses lots and lots of slang words (just in case we think Sandford isn't hip) and finally ends with a triumphant attack on Paul's marriage (which was not over when the book was published).Don't bother."
3,In its own write,"It's not that book is bereft of any literary merit, as some have asserted. It's that it just functions better as a chronology of events, rather than a narrative, which, by this point, everyone knows anyway. What's interesting here is just how the author charts the four Beatles' projects, and ties them together, giving their combined history a sense of confusion and tension. This book also delves more deeply into the biting acrimony between Paul and John in ways the polished Anthology and other biographies simply haven't. An essential read? No, but it'll take its place in the canon."
2,There are much better ones out there!,"I am not saying you should avoid this book at all cost, but it is by far not the best Bio on McCartney. Filled with mistakes, badly written and incomplete. It will not give you a deeper insight on the live of McCartney."
1,Two thumbs down,"Poorly written, poorly researched -- it's as if the writer had tried put together a great work of art from torn bits of cocktail napkins... and had a hard time filling in the gaping spaces between."
3,Reviews... a sham ?,"I ""voted"" on the reviews, giving a ""not helpful"" to two of the three. To my surprise, irrespective of my vote they were counted as ""helpful... "". I think ole AMAZON has B. Gates running the abacus!"
4,Good tool for test prep,"I found that Kaplan's bio GRE review book accurately represented the contents of the test. It gives a good review of the material covered on the GRE (although with a few minor errors) and the practice test was very similar in content, structure, and difficulty to the real one.Update: I just got my scores back, and I stand by my review :) an excellent buy, it was definitely worth it."
3,Worst than I expected,"I used the second edition of this book to study for the biology GRE.The book is ok if you want a general perspective. However, when you go into detail, the book simplifies to much and some things in the book are wrong.Also, I purchased it mainly for the practice test, which I found was poorly constructed because the graphs were messy and the questions were ambiguous and some had the wrong answer marked as correct. The booklets from ETS are a better practice for the real thing.I used a general biology book to study as well as this one, and the general biology book was much better."
2,You can find a much better review book!,"Although the book does contain sections on most of the important topics to review for the Bio GRE, the writing style is often confusing, and the author places emphasis on obscure aspects of some topics. There are also some typos (for example, omitting one half of an equation) and questionable or misleading statements. The practice test at the end has many poorly written questions and is not really very similar to the real practice exams available from ETS. Try another book if you need a bio GRE review guide!"
5,GREAT BUY,"I waited till 3 days before the GRE bio to prepare. I did it by reading this book. The stuff in this book very closely aligns with what is on the test. As long as you know your stuff and paid attention in class it offers just enough detail of a review to jog all your memories.In fact, some of the exact questions the GRE exam asked on test day were little factoids contained in this book.I do not know my score yet (just took the test this morning) but I have a gut feeling I did good.So in summation: buy this book and no other! I did not even read a general bio textbook; I think that if you basically know your stuff already the kaplan guide is all you are gonna need .I found the plant info and info on evolution very helpful"
5,Great for small groups,"We ordered the book and this study guide for our small group. We love it. Elizabeth George has a great way of focusing on the things that are very important in your life, God, Family, You."
2,Its okay for the price,"There are clearly better wheels available if you want to spend the money, but for the price, this one is okay.It is a little difficult to get used to, but once you do it drives okay. It has better sensitivty then a normal analog thumb-stick, but not as much as a higher-end wheel.As soon as you hold it you can tell it doesn't have the construction quality of other controllers. One faulty bit of design, the springs that re-center the wheel depend on small plastic knobs (with a screw through the middle) inside the controller. If you turn the wheel too hard you can break the plastic knobs and lose the spring back to center."
1,Really lousy controller,"Don't buy this controller! I bought this to try to seeif it is as good as the company that made it claim it to be.The innovative design and concept will attract you butat the end of the day you want a controller that let youdrive your car properly.I realise this is a very bad controller, first of all using themicrosoft normal controller is much better than this socalled ""pro racer"" controller. The degree you can turn thesteering wheel is so small, such that by just turning a bityou car will turn wide and skid.You will not be able to make fine driving adjustments,which is what you need if you want to enjoy a driving game.Well, I have really wasted by money buying this and feellike throwing it away. ""sign"", but I did not know at first.And I have no opportunity to try it out at the shop."
2,ahhhhh! off course by a concerned 11 year old gamer,"This controller is BAD! I don't mean cool bad, I mean bad-bad!I try playing rallisport challenge with this controller and lose every race! On rallisport there are lots of long straights and I veere off-course on a straight! The regular microsoft controller handles way well. So that's 30 bucks down the drain for you. So stick to the regular controller to stay on the track."
2,NOT WORTH THE $$,"I bought one of these wheels and although it does have acceptional steering-responsive-sensitivity, less than an hour after getting it home and for whatever reason the back and the start buttons began sticking. As soon as you start a game with it plugged in it just flips back and fourth between screens!!I decided to make sure that there was nothing physically stuck inside of the contoller and removed the back of it. NOTHING! It just sticks and refuses to function properly!"
2,I should have gone to the library...,"I needed to issue a bid on a new project involving digital filtering/DSP and picked this book up for a quick refresher course on Digital Filter Fundamentals. It's OK I guess, but not worth the 100 bucks I spent on it.Next time I'd spend a half hour in the Library with the previous edition -which was checked out at my local college library when I needed it - and save the money. The other reviews which tout the C code examples are being overly generous IMHO. The code examples seem to me to have been pasted in as an afterthought rather than developed as an integral part of the material. I'm not sure where this book's niche is, I don't believe this product is unsafe, and as far as I know, no animals were harmed in its creation, but it didn't really serve my purpose, and I can't say I would recommend it as an introductory text on Filter theory either. One man's opinion. YMMV.Bob Stephens"
4,Cryptic Conceptualization of Space,"Henri Lefebvre's epic book, The Production of Space is a cryptic exploration into the production of various kinds of space. While I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a comprehensive spatial analysis, I warn the reader to avoid jumping into the book blindly. It is not a book to be kept on the night table and read leisurely before drifting off to sleep. It is a serious book and requires serious concentration on the part of the reader."
2,an open book,"This is a fragmented and speculative work, from which readers (e.g. Soja, Harvey, Elden and Shields) have been able to draw rather contradictory and diverse conclusions. In part, that's because there's a lot in here, but it's not terribly consistently or coherently presented. I've read most of it twice and parts several times more -- there are lots of intriguing sketches of ideas, and the reader can fill them in in lots of different ways, but I'm not convinced it's worth it."
4,For the Avid Hiker,"I finally broke down and purchased this item. I ""live"" at the parks with my daughter and there are many that just aren't stroller friendly. We used to do a lot of hiking and camping, which is why I decided on this product as opposed to similiar items such as the Evenflo model. So far we have only used it on moderate hikes. It is pretty comfortable and has lots of storage space. I have seen similiar products and this one seems to have the most comfortable child seat. The child hangs in it with nice thick padding around their thighs and felt covered straps.We will be taking it to Yosemite in the future and I am curious to see how it will do on an all day trek."
4,"""jazz & blues flavor with an exciting score""","Varese Sarabande presents a Randy Edelman score - ""The Whole Nine Yards"" with additional tracks featuring Mose Allison, Charles Mingus, Stephanie Biddle and oh yes, Mr. Bruce Willis. Edelman who gave us the score to ""Kindergarten Cop"" does well on this score, much of it electronic. Tracks twenty-three and twenty-four Edelman creates shades of ""Henry Mancini/Pink Panther"" cult-sound, which is very welcome and favorable to the score.The entire CD has a presence of Jazz and Blues flavor, with an exciting score to complete the circle of an enjoyable listening pleasure. Last track gives us ""They All Laughed"" (Ira & George Gershwin) that never goes out of style. Highly recommend this album to film score collectors for - ""The Whole Nine Yards""!Total Time: 56:48 on 28 Tracks/ Varese Sarabande - 302 066 114 2 (2000)"
5,Great Movie-Great soundtrack,"I've seen the film many times, and it was great.Ive listented to the soundtrack and loved it!!However i did not find the beautiful saxophone music in the scene where they meet in the clinic and ""taking care"" of the dead cop.If anybody has heard it please send me the name of the song(maybe its noy even on the soundtrack)Email:yarinh1@hotmail.comThanksYarin"
2,The Whole Nine Yards,"I gave it 2 stars. One for each time I enjoyed the music. Ya know, I found the whole soundtrack singularly forgettable. Except for the Marshall Biddle Trio, w/Stephanie Biddle vocals. I have searched everywhere on the web and cannot find anything else about them. But I want to. I wonder if anyone out there does, and if they do, would you tell me? I want more...of them."
5,"Great laughter & cute cartoons to overcome ""numerical"" fear!","This book is a great hoot for those who can laugh at their fears of numerical weakness. Do not be misled to be serious about the title. Humorist Will Roger's said that we are all ignorant, just different subjects. Well, ... Myles Hollander and Frank Proschan, exorcise that ignorance away with their charming wit and deep insights. They both are internationally renowned academic scholars in the science called Statistics, with Professor Proschan having retired and enjoying writing children's stories for his grandchildren, etc. Think of spirits like Dr. Seuss writing about quantitative thinking. So see the light and lighten up with your silly fears about numbers, probabilities and reason with more quantitative confidence after reading this truly playful book. Enjoy thinking better!"
2,I'M THE SPICE GIRLS BIGGEST FAN BUT.......,"this book was not that good, it was just the same old stuff I allready know (nothing new) why can't someone make a book that doesn't borr you to death! I can write a better book! You know what I think i will, thanks for the idea!"
5,It was a fascinating book on the then FAB FIVE!!!,"It had tons of detail and cool pictures!If you liked those other phony Spice books you'll love this REAL book about the coolest band today,THE SPICE GIRLS!!!"
4,Brothers Under the Skin by Matthew May,Great book about overall freshman life at a big university! Refreshing take on the importance of relationships and how they are formed when individuals are thrown together in a college setting.
4,Dydeetown World,"Dydeetown World,Dydeetown World is actually three short stories strung together to form the whole. The characters, stories, and writing are all very simple yet interesting enough to keep a reader entertained.The main character is a Private Eye who appears to be a bit down on his luck but his luck and his life all change when a clone of Jean Harlow enters his office seeking help. Jean Harlow leads us to the Lost Boys, which in turn leads us back to Jean Harlow weaving the stories together seamlessly.I did enjoy the read but on the other hand I found the book to be a bit choppy in its pace. Although the stories flowed together nicely, I found the stories in themselves to be a bit thin. Perhaps F. Paul Wilson could have added more detail to the world building aspects of this book. I feel he also could have taken a bit more time developing the characters. This single book may have made a nice thick trilogy.All in all the book was enjoyable even in its very simplistic form."
4,"The strongest of FPW's ""future"" works","Of all the futuristic, ""harder"" sci-fi books that Wilson has written, Dydeetown Town is by far the most successful, largely because it finally emphasizes character and plot, which are Wilson's stronger points, over his interesting but somewhat shallow worlds. Mixing private eye stories with genetic engineering and Orwellian government, Dydeetown World creates an intriguing subculture out of its cast of outcasts, black marketeers, runaway clones, and violent underworld figures. And in its three short tales, Wilson ends up crafting a complicated tale that would hold its own in the mystery genre, one with some legitimately surprising payoffs and some nice twists along the way. It's no Repairman Jack, but of Wilson's future-based books, it's easily his strongest piece, and well worth reading."
3,very good,"It is a very good review book, especially you will get an idea of what are the most important things to know about a topic. However it is not a comprehensive source. Consider it as a comlementary."
4,a worthful reading book for medical students,"it is easy to realizing basic clinical medicine but important with a model of questions and answers. I like it,especially in neurology. it made me understand the basic thinking process of neurology."
5,Good comfortable shoes,"For my feet, they are the best shoes so far for going to work or just walking around town."
5,Best Album,"This is the best album from ABC that I have ever listened to! The best track on the album is ""The Night You Murdered Love"". Love that track!!!"
4,Historical and Interesting Cooking Lovers grab This One,"This book offers some very practical information on how to stretch a meal...historically written but it could be used in today's stressed out economy, as well. If you love to cook and you love history, this is a good book that combines and captivates the interest for both."
1,Perfect for the 1900s,"I had very high hopes for this, thinking 30 minute meals, quick tips for the kitchen. Instead it was more like go fetch water from the well, start a nice big log pile out back! Big time warp! I may be going a little overboard, but I'm not that far away. If you are looking for a view to the paaaast, this is the book for you. I zapped it!"
3,Some hearts are worth waiting for.,"This was the third, and last, studio album the Everly Brothers recorded for Mercury Records. It is also the weakest of the three albums. The main problem here is that the songs aren't quite as good this time around. The fault there lies with the Everlys themselves, since they wrote seven of the ten songs here. I suppose it's admirable that they wanted to write the majority of the material themselves, but the other Mercury albums (where they only wrote one to three songs) are better."
3,"It's a rare glimpse, at a person in the midst,with their struggle with Anorexia","I believe this book is of importance to anyone with a similiar struggle regarding Anorexia Neurvosa.It describes their experience,during the midst of their treatment,aswell as a glimpse intohow they felt, emotionally, physically, and most importantly, how they were able to write a book, under such difficult conditions.This author, survivor, and humanitarian, gets 3 stars, for their forceful, courageous,and honest efforts.2 thumbs up.Steven Nichols"
1,Keep your receipt! Poor paper-load design...,"60+yo parent bought product at Wal-Mart over holidays b/c adult offspring were present to address any tech difficulties. Darned if loading the paper didn't turn out to be the most inconvenient & unmanageable ""tech"" task! W/ no help from postage-stamp-sized drawing on instruction sheet (which provides no further textual instructions!), we searched the web to find similar user complaints resulting in return of product. So off to Wal-Mart we go, receipt in hand to battle return lines engorged w/ bad Xmas gifts & poorly-designed Casio calculators."
5,CajunBelle,Exactly what I wanted & needed -- just the right size and can be run by battery or a/c adapter
4,A nice little calculator.,Got this for my father-in-law who decided he need a handheld printing calculator. He loved it. It is easy to set-up and fairly uncomplicated to use.
5,great,This was good for my small company to use easy to feed paper and comes with ink is a great buy
4,Good for the price,I purchased it as a gift for one of my friends and saw him happily using it. What else is required. Good purchase for the price.
1,Pass on This One,"I love casio products and have purchased for years. This one I thought would be great for my desk for the size, and it was but...it would not turn on. The 'on' button was stuck, pushed in and would not release. You need to purchase ink for it on your own, a bother. Really disappointed, sent it back."
4,love it.,"I've owned a Casio calculator for years. That isuntil one my of cats used it to express her/hislove for me.The one I had was discontinued so I bought theHR-8TM. It's just as good as my old one.Easy to make no nonsense entries etc.I have just one wish- that it included a formatfor calcing time-hours, minutes, and a format foryardage. As a sewer this would have been great.Otherwise no complaints. If one of these wereincluded I would award 5 stars instead of 4.I'd buy another Casio if this one craps out.No pun intended LOL."
4,Good game.,If you like 2D fighting games then this is easy to recommend whether you are a fan of the Gundam Seed anime series or not. It has enough modes to stay busy for a decent length of time. The mobile suits to me look pretty good for being a GBA game. The backgrounds look pretty good as well.As far as gameplay goes this is pure fan service with an excellent dose of fun. The menus are basic but easy to navigate. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good GBA game. And if you have a link cable you can play your friends ( not sure if they have to have a cartridge or not).
5,The best for travel,"I discovered this great travel hygiene product many years ago and it became a necessity almost immediately. The problem became, however, that for some reason the manufacturer no longer seems to sell them in retail outlets. You can find their handwipes, but not these. If I could I would give the wipes 10 stars, but while the cost per item through Amazon is inexpensive, the shipping doubles the cost. Please Playtex - resume distribution to retail stores."
5,You'll Love Carrying These With You...,"To put this as simply as I can...""Baby"" Wipes (although these aren't called that) aren't only for Babies. If you ever found yourself in a situation where regular paper wasn't as effective as it should be, having these with you can greatly assist.They're small (but fold out to a decent size), you can put them in your wallet, pocket, or purse, and you won't have to worry about difficult clean-ups anymore."
5,the best personal wipes,these are the best personal wipes with the cleanest use. I cannot find them in stores anymore. And they are better than the other brands of personal wipes. Fewer chemicals and more witchhazel and aloe.
1,Individual packaging disintegrated!,"I thought these would be handy to carry one or two in my purse, ""just in case"", but the wrapping came open, the wipes got dirty, and my bag ended up wet! Terrible product, definitely would not buy again."
5,The Perfect comfortable boot with style,"Originally I was seeking the furry style in winter wear boot; but when I came across these through Amazon's recommended list of boot types in the catagory I was in at the time, the style & brand name suggested that I had to take a chance. WOW - I am so glad I did so as the boots are amazing - comfortable (perfect to size even with socks), stylish and a classic. Having these boots over the furry style mukluks so popular now, I know I have a boot that is quality made and will not go out-of-style next season. Looking for these boots with other internet and local vendors, I quickly found that Amazon beat their price everywhere. One more thing - the comfort factor is VERY high, THE most important factor whenever I buy footwear of any style. These boots are one of the best boots I currently own...and I have lots of boots (yes - my favorite piece of clothing to buy - shoes & boots). Wish I could wear them everyday! Come on Winter weather!"
1,Very dangerous!!! Be careful!!!,"My seven year old girl slipped and hit her chin on the floor with these and required 7 stitches!!!! on her chin. she was just ""racing"" around on them sitting on her bum,lost her balance and split open her chin on the floor. VERY PAINFUL AND SAD."
4,Second Best Holiday Gift,"These were a real hit. My niece said they were her second favorite gift of the holiday season - and that is saying something.They are exactly the same scooters that you find at gym classes around the country (or did years ago). They have the same perks and flaws. Sturdy-seeming swivels, wheels that roll, built to last, but at some point they will need replacing. IMO, minimal supervision is required.They slide well on linoleum, the hard wood, and around the cult-a-sac. A great way to get the kids active and playing. Now all we need is a parachute...Recommend without reservation. (the lack of the final star is because I am certain with heavy use they will need to be replaced within, say, 18-36 months, but I will change my review if they last beyond that.)"
1,Straps Are Not Black,"I ordered these as well and the straps I received were white. I too wanted black straps, that's what was shown. Don't order these straps unless you need them in white."
1,Includes a much-wanted episode but doesn't play correctly,I bought this DVD for my dad as a Christmas gift but unfortunately it isn't playing correctly. It skips back and forth between color and B&W; mode in the middle of play and it stops abruptly at odd times.I hope the replacement copy will play correctly!
2,still looks fake,"I apreciate the hard work put into this, but it still looks fake. It's much better than the early colorization attempts but, it still doesn't look right. Some of the colors don't seem right and the blacks and greys are still in black and white. It doesn't seem like attention was payed to reflected color. The only good point is that this would be a good way to get younger people / kids intrested into the Stooges"
3,Three Stooges Stooged And Confoosed,This looks to have some pretty funny episodes on it.I can't wait to see an ache in the stake but Columbia has apparently cut it to only 4 episodes hence the 3 stars I will buy it thou because of the shorts in it.I like the fact that you will be able to toggle between color and black and white but I'd like to see more shorts.
1,"If they can make them look so great in B&W, why keep on colorizing them!!!","I love the old Stooges shorts. At less then twenty mintues, some of them have more laughs in then some full-length comedies today. I just wish the studio would continue restoring these shorts as well as they can in B&W and stop wasting their time colorizing them. Colorization is changing an artistic piece of work. I rented this DVD off of Netflix because I just wanted to see the shorts in black and white. They were in great condition. Please release a big collection of all the Stooges shorts with remastered sound and picture quality. I would buy it and I know hundreds of Stooges fans would, too. Just don't COLORIZE the shorts!"
2,"Good, but . . .","I'm a big champion for the colorization of old black and white film, so I have to give credit to the makers of this DVD for giving discerning viewers the choice of how to watch their Stooges. However, this stuff is just too violent."
3,Pay attention to dimensions!,"Bought this for a young boy who wanted a replacement for the ""Bobcat"" that his dog chewed up. I thought I would get a die cast model that would be less appealing to the dog. Very disappointed as soon as I opened the box. 1:32 scale didn't sound too small, but this thing is tiny. Still waiting for two more Norscot toys I ordered and after looking at the dimensions more carefully, I suspect I may be returning the whole order. More of a small replica than a child's toy. He has not seen it yet, so maybe it will work out, but pay close attention to the dimensions before you purchase any of the Norscot toys. It's really a shame I have to make a choice between cheap, expensive plastic toys like Bruder, or metal toys that may last but are too small to play with."
5,Best CD from Pyramaze & maybe power/prog metal album of '08,"I have to easily agree with the two other 5 star reviews here about this latest offering from Pyramaze. Out of the 3 albums the band has released thus far 'Immortal' is not only their heaviest, but also their most beautiful & to top it off Matt Barlow as usual proves how powerful his vocal abilities are whether they are used for thrash metal or for a more complex style such as progressive or power metal. Too bad he isn't with the band anymore after such a tremendous release. Worth every penny!"
5,Best album from them yet.,"I got into this band because I was a big fan of Lance King's singing on the Balance of Power album, ""Ten More Tales of Grand Illusion."" I really enjoyed the first two Pyramaze albums. And when I heard that they were making their new album with Iced Earth's Matt Barlow, I was pretty stoked.When I got it in the mail, within a few minutes I played it on my computer. I really enjoyed Matt Barlow's vocals with the band better, it felt a little darker, and a little heavier then the previous albums. The music was excellent too, and the lyrics were great. Caramon's Poem is easily my favorite song on the album. If progressive power metal is your thing, definitely check this album out. You won't regret it."
4,5+,I bought this for my 3 y.o. thinking that even though she couldn't follow the directions to build complicated stuff she could still have some fun with it. She is closer to 4 and and she wasn't even close to be able to snap those pieces together. Otherwise it's seems durable and fun. I would not recommend it for kids earlier than 5 (if not older) though.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FOR A '97 COROLLA DX,It just won't work. The instructions were confusing and unhelpful. I was unable to complete the install and ended purchasing this: Metra 99-8101 Dash Kit For Toyota Multikitturbo 84-04
2,Great for 1 1/2 years,This was the perfect size for my office. Loved that it didn't have wasted space with a freezer that I wouldn't use. Problem is...it died. Warranty good for 12 months and mine is 18. So it cost me about $6 a month to own. Not too bad I guess but I wouldn't do it again! I won't buy another Haier!
2,"Gets 'Chilly', But Never Cold","Before I bought this product I read reviews that said that this refrigerator never gets really cold no matter what setting you put it on. I also read that milk would go bad.But I (foolishly) bought the product anyway, and have learned from first-hand experience that this fridge (1) is just barely cold enough to keep meat from spoiling, (2) is not cold enough to keep frozen dinners frozen, and (3) will not keep milk from getting sour.I could not afford anything more at the time (price was great!), and I still have this product --just to keep soda and water 'chilly'. But I hope to get a real refrigerator within the next few months.If you can afford something better, don't buy this product."
2,Reliable? Hardly...,"Bought this thinking I could use a simple fridge for my dorm room. It worked great for about 5 months, and then nothing happened. I checked with Haier and they said without the original receipt I couldn't get a replacement. So now I have a big black box that is totally useless to me. Bargain yes, but it's just not worth it to waste the money. I can't recommend it."
3,"Pretty crappy, but workable","This is the cheapest mini fridge on the market, and you get what you pay for. That said though, it works. If you're just looking for something to keep your lunch or some beers in, go nuts, this is all you need. Past that, this is pretty shabby. The freezer compartment may as well not exist as it instantly ices over, never to be heard from again. (seriously, just stop putting that in, it's too small anyway). Mine arrived dented and scratched. Tough to tell who to blame on that front, but other reviews lead me to believe that most of them arrive that way."
4,Decent Mini Fridge,"This mini fridge is good for the price. It's cool enough to keep beer, soda, etc. cold but the freezer part is not quite cold enough to keep things frozen. We put a few ice cream bars in there and they did melt a bit."
4,Mini Refridgerator,Product does everything it promised and everything I expected. I think it was well worth what I paid for it.
1,Haier refrigerator,"terrible buy and waste of money. never worked when plugged in.had to send it back. motor was working when plugged in but it never cooled. lesson learned, buy a popular brand name fridge."
1,Awful,I brought this thing about 16 months ago and it barely gets cold not only that the freezer part is always freezing and melting even after messing with the temp dial so anything i put in the fridge on the right side ends up soaking wet this thing is just god awful
3,Curiously flat for the Dregs...,"Die hard Dregs fans are probably going to hate me for this, but I find this one of the Dreg's less inspired albums. The energy and sense of fun was all but gone by this point in the band's history, leaving only the Dreg's superb musicianship and intricate charts. The one exception is the chicken pickin' blowout ""Gina Lola Breakdown,"" which is the only thing that saves ""What If"" from a two-star rating. Casual listeners should get ""Freefall"" and ""Night of the Living Dregs,"" both fantastic albums which neatly encapsulate what the Dregs are all about, i.e. a coherent and entertaining fusion of funk, country, jazz, classical, and rock music. Die hard fans (of which I am one) will want to get everything up to 1980's ""Dregs of the Earth."" Avoid ""Bring 'Em Back Alive,"" the unfortunate 90s Dregs reunion. If you would like to read more reviews like this, check out JazzboNotes.com."
4,dixie dregs,"the what if cd,what can i say it's a excellent album fusion music,different styles,,and the musician on the cd is talented,i'll reconmend anybody to give it a listen."
4,A longtime favorite,"I've always loved this album. Very beautiful, well produced and varied. Saw them live about '79 at the College of Charleston, a peak event in my concert going (Also there, I beleive were Papa John Creach and Vassar Clements - an awesome time). Anyway , this one never lets you down."
2,"Great for Learning, but Not Durable","This is a nice learning toy for children, but we had trouble with ours breaking. My 4-year-old son, who generally isn't hard on toys managed to break the clock within a couple months. The hands didn't match up with the time display. I took the clock apart and managed to fix it but it was not easy to fix. About a year later, he broke it again. I remembered how difficult it was to fix so the clock is in the garbage. I'm very sad about this because my son who is now 5, could still learn from this clock. He's just learning to count my 5s and up to this point only knows the 0'clocks, 30s, quarter-afters, and quarter-tos."
3,A little too far from reality,"Okay, I'll admit I knew before I picked up this book that I was leaving the real world behind and taking a trip down the road of great imaginations, but come on... a guy teaching himself control his own brain waves? While the majority of this book has some good sub plots and suspense, I found the outcomes a little to predictable. The ""good guys alwarys win"" seems to hold true with this series and while I like to see the good guys win, this particular book doesn't offer much to leave you guessing about what might happen next... though I'll still pick-up one of the other books in the series in anticaption of a better plot."
2,Bad Recipe for a Good Series,"The Net Force series was a good concept when it began, but has steadily gone down hill. This most recent effort appeared to continue the trend toward cranking these out by a predetermined recipe, rather than using this the opportunity of changing main characters to break new ground. Even the high tech angle was getting decidedly RW. And the story abruptly ended like someone reached a predetemined page length and said, well we have to end this thing. Can't we spice up the recipe?"
5,Great twist to the classic game.,"What I really love about this game is the shear amount of detail they put into it. The rooms on the board have so many humorous items in them - many referencing individual shows. You can see stampy the elephant, Mr. Burns' ape vest, the Pin Pals jacket, a ""worst convention ever"" T=shirt in the comic book shop, Bobo the teddy bear, the three eyed fish, the Rodney Dangerfield missing son, Marge dressed like she was on the island in the Prisoner spoof episode, and a ""thank you come again welcome mat in the Kwik-e-mart. Definitely a lot of fun. Played exactly as clue except the names and pictures are different."
4,Cool packaging but...,"...way too easy to finish. I played 3 times the other day and the game was done within 5 minutes. Also, the board and cards wear away and fray pretty easily. Do not buy this unless you keep in in immaculate condition.The artwork is pretty cool and the whole thing is cute and colorful but beware the short lastability. Tho it's definitely worth getting if you're a Simpsons completist and are serious about keeping it in good condition."
5,The Best Toy Ever,"Wow this is such a fun game. Simpsons fans will love this game even if you don't know how to play Clue , and Clue fans will maybe like the Simpsons Edition of Clue so much that they might even watch them on tv. I love this game! Buy it's worth it"
1,Lacks reality.,"These authors have never been part of an elite force, or maybe they were brain washed during their encounter. I have never seen a man or woman give up their identity, needs, and desires in personal situations. Though highly trained, and do obey a commander, they do not stop thinking. The military does not want androids; who does? Warriors are reasonable or they are terrorists; if scientists are not then it is no wonder the world is at war."
3,"Not bad, but...","Reading a book by a previously unpublished author is a bit like ""buying a pig in a poke""; you never know what you are getting. I can still remember the thrill I felt almost 30 years ago when I first found and read the initial book by a then-unknown Stephen King. That's what keeps me experimenting with new writers, hoping the magic will strike once more. This is not a particularly bad book, but the writing isn't particularly good, and the dialogue is often quite stilted. The plot is very interesting, although there are what I felt to be some silly aspects to it. These gentlemen may have a future as writers, and I will definitely give them another chance."
1,Excellent potential. Authors need to take a few seminars,"The storyline in this book is excellent. The ability of the authors to tell a story, unfortunately, is not. The problem is the authors seem to lack storytelling skills. As a technology professional I admire their writing, which would sparkle if the book were a technical dissertation. However, when I read a novel (a rare thing), I want it to read like a novel and not like a technical document. If the authors take a few seminars on creative writing, learn how to use words to elicit emotions (except for disdain) and to engage the reader, then rewrite this book it would easily rate 5 stars. Like I said, the storyline is wonderful - the telling of it is, well, dry and sterile."
2,if you wanted the extras... tough!,In every street fighter comic they have released you get extras like the prequel where ryu fights sagat in this all you get is the story and that is just damn upsetting. udon if ur gonna publish these comics give us everything dont crop it. u never change the orignal. your better off looking for all the comics on ebay or something cause this book isnt what die hard fans want.
1,Udon wants your money,"Udon releases the single Street Fighter comics with back-up stories, multiple covers, comic strips, photo sessions... Then, they release the trade collection (only one month after the comic arc is completed!), but without any of the extras (the back-up stories are directly related to the main plot, so you WILL be missing information by reading the trades)!They basically release the trade as fast as possible, but with the smallest size, the minimum content they could, just to ""get"" the trade fans (with the small price - due to the cut corners). At ther same time, they release the monthly comic with the alternate covers and extras to force the readers to collect the singles too (you can't get the complete thing with only the trades). That's really sad.Worst of all, the story suffers from multiple artists in every issue. In one page Chun-li looks like a cute girl, in the next she'll look like a man, then an old woman! Their artists can't even do 20 straight pages!"
3,What Happened to Being on Time?,"I didn't get my book on the exact day you said. I like how you have every book I want, but we don't get it on the set date. Why? Please, be certain next time. Anyway, other then that, you're products are good! And it takes to long till we get our order."
3,Street Fighter Vol. 1,"Round One: FIGHT!Though I still have fond memories of playing Street Fighter II for the Super Nintendo back in grade school, I'll admit that I don't quite remember the game having any plot to speak of. Well, I just finished the comic book, and, my opinion hasn't changed all that much.As you might expect, the series tells the story of a Ryu, who--SUPRISE!--gets into street fights aplenty. The honorable brawler finds his beloved sensei slain in his own dojo and sets off to find the killer, running into all manner of classic characters along the way. (Including Guile, the bombastically American super-soldier, who was my personal favorite back in the day. SONIC BOOM!)Don't get me wrong, the Udon Crew obviously loves the original games, and has created a fitting homage to them (complete with manga-styled visuals). The only problem is that you'd have to be the age I was when I first bought a SNES to enjoy the story."
1,Buy the comics instead,"I'm completely upset by this trade. I only bought it for the ""good"" art from guest artists on the backup storties that are NOT INCLUDED. The book is in a poser manga style 8""x6"" format. Alvin Lee's art is lack luster, unimaginative and 100% sweatshoped art. Buy this book if you want a small fanzine from a group inexperienced kids from Canada making faux anime screenshots."
4,They break SPITTOON!,"Based on comments of 10 year old boy.) This book is the last in a series of four so far (NP from Outer Space, Planet of the NPs, Invasion of the NPs, and Your Mummy is a NP). The main gag in the whole series is that the aliens look like they are picking their noses, but they are really operating internal nose computers. Earth has just become the main tourist attraction for tourists from the planet Pan. Pants, as they are called, love to go to the dentist, be stuck in traffic jams, and sneeze. But they are not able to sneeze, so they might not visit, and the Earth might be moved past Pluto as a result. To stop this, Stan from Pan and Devin from Earth go back in time to ancient Egypt to bring back Nile Delta Goldenrod, a weed that Pants are allergic to. They goof and change history. Now the world is one big Egypt!"
4,I LOVED IT!!,"The sleek and compact size is totally awesome for those ""I wish I had my camera"" moments. The only dissappointment was that sometimes the pics don't come out, like they will have an exposed streak in them. This only happened to me 2 times out of a whole bunch of rolls of film, and the other let down was the film is OUTRAGOUSLY EXPENSIVE!! It comes to almost a dollar a picture!!! i was like OOOMMMMGGG!"
4,its great,"Its an awesome camera!it has a sleek design,and the thing to put around your wrist. But the film acually cost MORE than the camera!!!!!! And since it has different settings, if you choose the wrong setting, it comes out all blurry! And somtimes it leaks this weird stuff on you that you have to wash off FAST!I would reccomend this camera to everyone who doesn't mind being careful with settings, getting camera junk on you, and spending a fortune on film!"
1,Another religion-based self-help book,"If you are interested in a ""rely on God and Jesus"" fix your marriage, this is your book. I wanted something more down-to-earth and realistic, and found it very unhelpful. I did not even finish reading it."
1,"Shallow Characters, Shallow Plot","Elliot is a former screen writer, and this book is like reading a made for TV movie. The character development left me not caring for the people involved, and the plot bounced all over the place, often without good reason. Elliot relies on greasy hair to vilify one character, and good looks to let us know if a character is a ""good guy"". Touch, (the main character) is a man conflicted by the death of his bi-polar wife two years ago. This a great base for personal growth and insight of the lead character. Instead, Elliot turns Touch into a macho, drinking tough guy, who somehow is justified in things like fighting on an LA freeway and lying to protect people he likes. Generally is a bad version of Mel Gibson's character in Lethal Weapon.The only reason I read this book, is so you don't have to."
4,great tech for computer-inclined people,"First of all, what a great price for futuristic-sounding technology. The fingerprint-scan works great, and for those hard-to-reach places, comes with an extension cord. In case you don't like scan your finger or you have a job where for some reason your hands are prepetually dirty, it has backup plain old password protect.WARNING--if, for some reason, you are working on a computer w/out administrator privilages, you might have some problems. Probably everyone has had an experience where they had to ""install new hardware"" then restart the first time you plug a new flash drive in. if you can't install hardware, you will have to use the public sector, which is another great idea. You can repartition your flash drive to have different amounts of allocated memory for private and public files. I can't, for some reason, access anything I have done at school at home, and vice versa. Hmmm. Still, amazing technology. Recommended."
2,"good idea, poor implementation","I used this flash drive for a while and found it too slow and finger scan too unreliable. For some reasons finger scan is very flaky, sometimes it takes many swipes until it scans at least one of the fingers successfully. So very often I have to resort typing a password instead in popup window. If that's the case I'd rather use a software solution, like cryptosidekick, to make a secure vault out of any flash, which would be also significantly faster. This particular drive is extra slow, who knows why, it doesn't seem to do strong encryption, in fact, there is no information if it's secure at all. And the last thing, it doesn't work with Windows Vista, it shows unsecure partition, and that's it."
2,"Nice idea, but really only useful as a regular flash drive","I should not expect a whole lot for the price, and what I got was a good flash drive but not much of a useful security feature. The thumb or finger print scan feature just has not been reliable. But it is a good flash drive for a low price.For security features, however, it just doesn't compare with my IronKey flash drives that I also purchased through Amazon. Cost a bit more, but very, very dependable features and reliable drives."
1,good idea crippled by poor software and support,"The fingerprint scanner idea is great but the supporting software is poorly implemented. It wants to save all passwords you type in in a 'vault' so it can later auto-enter them for you. Unfortunately, password saving doesn't play nice with several pieces of software I run; Microsoft Money and Password Safe for example. With these two particular pieces of software, it 'hijacks' the screen and won't let me type in the password. Emails to Transcend asking how to disable the password saving went unanswered. Fingerprint scanner is somewhat difficult to use; I had to scan my finger multiple times to get it to take, although I suspect my technique would have improved with time. Drive is very fast reading/writing data."
1,Give me a Break!,"My Illusion is shattered. After scores of orders from Amazon, I got a real dud. Looks like this is VCRd from televison (maybe even French television). This is such a poor recording that it is not really viewable. If I could give it less than 1 star it would get it. And yes, it was returned. That was the only good thing about this transaction."
3,The Creepy Warren William Film,"My never-ending search for Warren William movies eventually led me to ""Strange Illusion"", one of the last films of his career, in which he plays an honest to God creep!Teenage Jimmy Lydon has been plagued by nightmares since his father's unsolved murder--and the latest one seems to suggest danger surrounding his mother. The next thing you know, mom announces she has a suitor, Warren William. Guess what? Uh huh, that's right. So this is partly David Copperfield/Mr. Murdstone and partly Hamlet/Claudius, as one reviewer made note. An unsavory twist is that Warren William has a fancy for underage girls, which doesn't bode well for Jimmy's girlfriend.Still and all, I liked ""Strange Illusion"" because it is major camp on top of everything else--others in my family hated it, though. Ergo, I guess it's just one of those movies you have to make up your own mind about."
5,"Good solution, low price",Bought this after doing internet research on horizontal lines and audio buzz with cable tv (Comcast in N Indiana) since the cable tech guy had no idea how to fix the problem. At first I connected it to my cable box and the incoming cable to the isolator. This worked...but I discovered that two of my high def channels did not come in. I was still pretty happy with the product because it totally eliminated the buzz and also took away the lines floating up my screen on all the other channels (and the channels that I usually watch were not affected). I decided to move the isolator in front of the cable splitter coming into the house to see what affect that had. This totally fixed the problem. The channels that did not come in before were now back and the lines and buzz were gone. Great solution for much less cost than the $50 that I saw for similar products.
4,Does the job - with a catch,"This worked great, totally removed the loop hum. Only problem was that it also filtered out bravo HD. All other channels came through, no clue why."
5,No hum again,Please trust the review you have read. This small thing really has played miracle in my system. The hum disappeared after I fit it to the CABLE. Highly recommended.
4,dayton audio is pretty good,I bought this product some time ago as well. because i had a hum that was coming from my tv cable. And for the most part it works for me. it didn't get rid of ALL the hum but it got rid of 97% of it. over all a good product.
1,Cable Signal Gone,"It did solve the hum but the down side was I cannot get any signal to the cable box.I have been having this ""voltage in the coax"" issue for years Comcast has been out (5 times) they could not fix it.The signal was good when tested by the tech before the isolator but once installed it cut the signal to a point where the cable box will not pick up any signal.Anyone have any other suggestions on how to get rid of the voltage present in the cable?Thanks"
1,Did not work for me,"I purchased this because of a video hum I get when using component cables. I installed the transformer, and it did not affect the scrolling bar. And it's definitely from the cable, because when I unplug the cable, the scrolling bar disappears. So even though it works for other people, it does not work for me."
3,"Works, But Weakened Signal",I plugged this in to resolve a speaker humming issue due to the TV and the computer wired to a common receiver. It worked and the humming went away. However the digital TV signal is now weaker and and some channels do not come in at all. So I removed it and discovered that the normal cable connector was a little loose coming out of the housing. I was able to solve my problem without the transformer by fidgeting with the normal connector until the humming went away. Eventually I will redo the cable connector and see how it works.
3,Does not work well with Cox Whole Home DVR System,"I like many have bad 50hz hum on my woofer and since my woofer is very powerful the hum was literally unbearable. This device definitely cured it for sure, one downside was though is that I lost most of my channels and they would tile really bad and some would not come in whatsoever. Unfortunately I am having to return it for this reason, its sad because it really does work just not with my system. The frequencies are correct from the 5 to 1ghz, but my whole home dvr system with Cox aparently does not like it, appears it affectes the tuning of the cable channels too much. I am sure this would work great otherwise...solid product."
1,Wrong jumprope,I ordered this beaded jumprope with removable weights and recieved a black speed rope that looks and is used for a different function all together. I even tried having them send the rope out again and they sent the same wrong jumprope again and I eventually had to order my jumprope from some else that wasnt quite what I was going for. Plus the speed-rope they sent me cracked a few weeks after I got it and broke right off. I hate to do this but this was the most unsatisfactory purchase that I have ever made on the internet in the last 10 years that I have been shopping online.
2,I agree...,I agree with the previous review - Lenny was brilliant on this recoding (as usual) but the quality of recording is horrible...
3,It's good but not like the Thai tea you get at restaurants,"I am a big fan of the Thai iced tea at the Thai restaurants. I wanted to give it a try at home. So I bought these tea bags thinking it would taste just like regular Thai tea. But I was very disappointed. It's not even close. Although it tastes good, but certainly not what I was looking for. It's very cinnamony! Real tea flavor is mild!"
4,Enjoyable,"I decided to purchase this tea after reading the review here at Amazon. I am enjoying the tea. It is a sweet mild tea, so for me, I do not need to add any additional sugar or sugar substitute. So easy to brew, just remove tea bag from the cup and drink. Yummy."
4,Really rooibos?,"I don't usually care for rooibos tea, and somehow I managed to miss that this was red tea, even though it's clearly stated in the product features. I figured I'd try it, since I now had 96 bags. I've enjoyed all of the other Yogi teas I've tried, and this was no exception. There are enough other flavors present in this tea to make the rooibos flavor more of an accent than an overpowering main flavor. I liked this tea hot; I love this tea iced. Its flavor is really refreshing iced.I usually steep four tea bags in four cups of hot water and refrigerate over night. Alternately, you can brew the tea double strong (i.e., four tea bags and two cups hot water) and either add enough cold water to make it regular strength or serve over ice which will dilute the tea to single strength."
2,Buggy,I loved this game...until all my progress randomly disappeared. A quick internet search revealed that this is a common bug and was never fixed by the programmers in any later versions. I suggest buying any sequel other than this one.
2,Super Granny 3,"I like this game but unfortunately you have to leave the disc in the computer to use it. If I take the disc out, I have to reinstall every time due to some copy write problem. I don't seem to have this if I buy from Big Fish games."
4,SG 3 is a little rough compared with 5 but still fun!,"I have Super Granny 5 and love it, but I have played through it over and over. Super Granny 3 actually has some harder levels than 5, but it's because the game overall is rougher...meaning Granny doesn't respond as fast to turning, digging, and running ...and with less control combined with enemies that are faster, it is challenging! The visual background is also not sharp or as clear as Super Granny 5 but I am still glad I bought Super Granny 3. It's a great value. I am looking forward to trying Super Granny 6 as soon as I can get it to work on my computer;)"
3,So-so...,"This game is fun...for a little bit. Then it gets boring and you never really want to play it again. Also, it is slow miving which is very boring in a video game. But for all you patient people, you might enjoy this game. I usually don't give products a review unless I am going to give them 5 stars, or one star, but I fet like I should give this one three stars. It's not good, but its not bad either."
3,Microsoft Office:Mac,I like it but it doesn't have the same menus as the PC version and I am having a little trouble finding commands that I want.
3,"Not all it could be, but still the standard","Frankly, I was disappointed by Office 2004 for the Mac. I purchased it as an upgrade from Office X. While it did add a few new features, most really weren't of significant interest to me. What I wanted was for Excel's Pivot Table features to match those of the Windows version -- they didn't. Then, to top it off, Word's revision tracking features were changed in such a manner as to make them far less useful and a lot more intrusive (and I have to use Word for all my work as an author and editor). Entourage was significantly improved from previous versions. I won't speak to PowerPoint as that is a part of the product I don't use. While other applications can read or write Office files, none do so with the fidelity or the full feature set of the ""real Office."" So, if real compatibility is what you need, this is the best game in town."
3,It's Microsoft...,"Not native to Intel Macs - so a little slow and buggy even with the latest patch (one a month!). But, Office 2008 eliminated Visual Basic - so what is a small business to do? For now we are sticking with 2004 and may skip 2008 all together for 2010?"
4,Great Package for Mac,"Perfect solution for using those windows programs we are used to...but on the Mac. Runs smoothly. Entourage is a fine email program and Word, Excel and the others work great. A little spendy, but worth it if you need it. Entourage communicates well with Oulook and has a similiar feel."
1,False Advertising,"This item is not the actual software. It's an UPGRADE. That means you have to have the actual software to use this. Unfortunately I did not have the actual software, therefore I can not use this product."
2,That's all ????,"As a user of v.X, I was looking forward to this. Well, as muchas anyone looks forward to new MS software. Maybe a root canal wouldbe more fun.I just don't see it. They want me to cough up $350 for a some really minorfeature additions? Even on the MS webpage, they have a hard time findingmore than 1-2 bullet 'enhancements' for each component. And I'd haveto believe that NoteTaker or NoteBook is a better application than whateverMS's v1 of their Notebook facility is. And don't forget the all important Messengerintegration :(Very disappointed."
5,Great software!,"I bought this product because my computer went haywire and I did not have my product key to reinstall the version that existed on my computer. I received the new copy of MS Office 2004 very quickly and in better condition than I expected. I am very happy with how it operates on my computer, and I would recommend this seller to anyone."
2,Useless for older Macs,"My needs for are not complex enough to require the latest 2011 version of Microsoft Office, so I decided to buy this software to save some money.I was very surprised when I learned that this 2004 cannot be used on post-2009 Macs. I found this out when I went to the Genius Bar at Apple and was informed of this fact.I have a 2011 MacBook Pro and if I want to get Microsoft Office, I would have to get the 2011 version. The page for this software is misleading in that it does not clarify this crucial exemption to people who are considering buying it."
4,A product worth having,"I was unable to get a copy of this software in Australia so it was great that I could get it from USA. I have an I-Mac G5 and the free Open Office software was usable, but M/S Office is so much better. The delivery was OK, too."
1,Poor description,This software is incompatible with the OSX Lion operating system. Spoke with Apple and found that the 2004 program is no longer supported. You will get a message: Can't open because Power PC applications are no longer supported. Market warehouse then goes on to say if package is opened in any way there will be no refund. BEWARE!!! You won't know it is incompatible until you try to load it.
4,Office 2004 for Mac,"It's the Office group of applications for the Mac. It works as advertised and allows seamless transfer of files between Windows and Macs (at least till most everyone has the newer iterations of Office on the PC,then the 2008 Office/Mac version will be mandatory."
3,there were problems,"I received what was clearly a pirated copy; however, I did get my money refunded."
5,Black Dynamite,One of the funniest films of the year! Maybe all time! More catch phrases then you can shake a stick at!
5,Watch with friends.,"Black Dynamite (played by Black Dynamite) does what he wants and has sex when he please in this grand masterful tale of action and intrigue. When Black Dynamite's dead brother Jimmy is killed he has no choice but to leave a trail of blood through the city to find those responsible. Who knows how far this path of vengeance could take him. With loads of bad ass kung fu treachery and good lovin' to boot. Arsenio Hall, Captain Kangaroo and that one guy from Reno 911 also star perhaps.(Runtime: only 90 of the best minutes of your life)"
5,you will digg it!,I saw this movie and I was laughing from beginning to end! It is the funniest movie that I have seen in a long time!!! The movie theater here in houston texas gave it a standing ovation!!! it should have gone mainstream at AMC!! not sure why?My boy bull horn did an outstanding job!! He's come a long way since the DWC newsroom back in the Bronx!! I always knew he would be great at comedy!This movie is a stone gas!! I'm sure that I missed some of it because I was laughing so much!!If you liked the Hangover which was funny...you'll love this movie..by a mile!Better than I'm gonna git you sucker & Undercover Brother! No joke!
4,Almost perfect,"Incredibly funny.After seeing clips of this movie on a couple TV shows, I just had to see it. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is an incredibly on-target homage to the blaxploitation films of the 70s. Everything in it... the music, the acting, the camerawork, the lighting, the look of the film stock, etc. transports you back to the 70s. And I can't believe that this film didn't get nominated for best costumes or set design! There are times when you can easily believe you're watching a film made 35-40 years ago.The only drawback to this film is that it seems to lose its way about 2/3 of the way through, as the plot takes us out of the 'hood and to an uncharted island run by a sinister Chinese mad scientist. There is a definite change of feel at that juncture, and the laughs become a little more sparse."
2,a Jive Sucker Turkey of a Movie,"i was all hyped for this movie, had a game of Uno going and was thinking about watching this film and getting down with some Bar B Que Chitlins and honey roasted Pigs feet. well the food turned out Alright, but this corny take on the classic films of the 70's felt generic and robotic. it had a couple of aight parts with a sneeze of a Laugh here and there, but overall this film was a real Jive Turkey with no slice of turkey and alot of stale ole Mayo.i wanted to get into it. the good news about this turkey of a film, is that i won my Uno game because the tiredness of the film made eyeballs start to fall asleep as I kept saying Uno, but this film was a tacky turkey."
1,Not funny,"Terrible, terrible, terrible movie. I thought this movie would be a funny blaxploitation satire. I didn't find anything about it that made me laugh. I didn't even mind the bad acting which is what I expected (the movie was made with an extremely low budget). I'm surprised Tommy Davidson and Arsenio Hall (both fine comic actors) agreed to appear in this movie. It must have been out of charity. There were two Mr. Big's. This first Mr. Big popped up and then quickly disappered with no explanation and then the second Mr. Big (Richard Nixon) popped up later. Michael Jai White's comic timing is way off. If you want to see a good blaxploitation satire you're better off watching I'm Gonna Git You Sucka. Don't waste you money on this one."
1,Black lo-Dynamite,"I'm a big fan of 70's Blaxploitation films, but you don't have to be to hate this. It was one of the most idiotic movies I have seen in a long time.African action legend Black Dynamite goes after 'The Man' for killing his brother Jimmy, for pumping heroin into local orphanages and for flooding the ghetto with hopped-up malt liquor.It's just so cliched and dumb. So it's acceptable for a black person to use racial slurs against white people as long as its in a comedy huh? And to shoot honkeys in the [blank]? There was no moment in this movie where I completely lost my serious face.I didn't laugh once in the theater, maybe just once but that was at a fat lady who had fallen out of her chair in the theater.Pretty awful movie and it's a shame you can watch this film in Germany."
5,Hilarious!,"It's unfortunate that this movie didn't get much hype, because it is funny as hell! They do a great job spoofing all the cheesey movies of the '70s. It is awesomely ridiculous and I laughed the whole way through."
4,Brilliant,"As good a parody as the Naked Gun series. Watch it ten times and you'll fall outta your chair ten times. They make fun of everything Blaxploitation, from the sloppy production (boom mikes hanging over the camera) to the over-done, wooden acting (""his little Chinese eyes lookin at me"") to Jim Kelly's ""Soo-yee!"" fighting yell. This is Undercover Brother on steroids. And it doesn't hurt that Arsenio Hall and John Salley are pimps either."
2,jive turkey of a solid idea,"The idea behind this to do a blaxploitation flick in this century is righteous, my brutha. The problem is someone forgot to pay a decent scriptwriter. The movie looks fantastic and captures that whole '70s B movie feel (even the obvious on purpose boom mics in scenes). The afros are tremendous. The dialogue at times right on, sista.I just found the whole movie as slow as Fred Sanford walking in his yard. Plus where are the laughs? I just found it fell incredibly flat.The trailer is what sold me on renting the DVD. Don't be fooled. The trailer is all it has going for it. Stick with the original '70s movies of the genre.Extras have a making of, commentary track and that's about all, my man."
2,"Couple of really funny moments, BUT...","I expected a little more from this movie. They did a pretty good job recreating the look and feel of a 1970s movie, but it just never quite makes the grade as a finished product. I won't give any of it away, but there are some good scenes, while others are just too staged, drawn out, or over the top."
4,"Good, but. . . .","This is a very impressive movie, very funny, and very creative. I love satire movies that don't SCREAM satire, unlike say the Scary Movie movies, or even the Naked Gun movies sometimes. My only complaint is that the movie dragged in the end. The plot is resolved about 1/2 way through, then again at about 2/3 of the way through, then it picks up again and gets again resolved in the end. They tried to pack too much plot into 1 film. They would have been better off to have saved some of it for a sequel, which I would gladly watch or purchase."
4,Interest as an important factor in learning,"This book generally emphasizes on the function of learners' interest during their reading/learning processes. People can accept this main idea as not very new, however, you can see, substantially, how various issues related to interest can be made. Moreover, each chapter in this book provides the insights, based on the empirical findings, about how we can make a link between learners' interest and learning itself(or comprehension). If we can clarify the relationship, then there should be great opportunities to apply it for effective instruction as well."
5,THE epitome of morbid comedy.,"I absolutely loved this series! I Luv Halloween is origional, and one of the darkest, most brutal black comedies out I ever seen/read. If you aren't a fan of things likeMetalocalypse: Season Onethen this aint for you. Its about bunch of cynical kids who try to enjoy trick-or-treating, and their hijinks always end up in some kind of insane massacre-fest. The artwork is perfect for the Halloween theme, but the art in the first volume has much lighter feel than that of other two. Each volume focuses on one Halloween night and each is equally enjoyable and has its own brilliant ending. There are plenty of jokes, stomach-churning gore, and random ""WTF!?"" moments. This is incredible stuff. Almost exclusively for horror and morbid comedy Enthusiasts only."
1,Quite a disappointment,"I liked the artwork because it reminded me of Jhonen Vasquez (Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, Invader Zim) so I bought this book. I thought the story was horrible and I didn't find it funny. I do have a demented sense of humor but apparently not that demented. I thought it was gross and just very disappointing. I expected so much more."
3,Carmen junk,I have zero interest in her. These were gifts for my boyfriend. The product itself is ok I guess. Shipping was better than the other items I bought at the time. Sorry took so long to post. New to amazon.
1,Strip ... Whattttttttttttttt ???,"Hi ...There`s a big ... Huge ... lie in the tittle of this DVD (Guess What?)Girls ... if you want to do some indoor dance fitness, be my guess !!!Guys ... don`t waste your time and your money in this item !!Regards !!"
1,No stripping...Not even teasing,"Carmen doesn't do any stripping and nobody else does either. Do you see that cute white top and pink shorts she wears on the cover? She doesn't even wear that during her ""excercise session"". She's clothed in an unsexy black outfit from the neck down. If you want to get some excercise, go out and do some jogging. If you want to see some stripping, buy a different DVD."
2,Carmen Electra Aerobic Striptease,"This DVD begins with a few easy exercises and stretches. Would not recommend it if your looking for a good work out. The second part goes into a very long and boring strip tease act showing you step by step how to do it. I was expecting something a bit more fun where as the act in the DVD is very boring, mostly done by laying on the bed. I hoped in purchasing this DVD to learn more exciting moves and get a better work out. Was disappointing."
3,it's ok...,Could be better... I will be skipping out on some of the moves on the bed because they are just plain stupid and not sexy.
1,"No warm-up, no full run-through...disappointing!","I own the original set, and really love them. These new ones are just not up to par. This one is especially disappointing. The moves feel like they're right out of the mid-90s, and the only full run-through of the combination with music is filmed more like a music video...complete with SLOW-MO scenes, meaning there is NO WAY to follow along with it! A total waste. And not at all a workout! NOT EVEN A WARM-UP! I love Carmen, but I doubt I'll ever use this DVD again, unless i'm trying to prove to a friend that it really is THAT bad...Carmen Electra's Fit to Strip"" I really love it, and it gives you an AWESOME workout!"
4,good video,"I like this video, I feel really sexy doing it and put a mirror by the tv so I can watch myself. I dont feel to much of a work out but I love the new moves its taught me."
5,Needed it for Class,The cost was fantastic. Everyone in my class spent far more than I did on their book. Great deal...Love it!!!!!
3,Good beginning,debated over the purchase of this book for several months before I decided to purchase this book thanks to the previous reviews. I was not as impressed once I began to read it. But for those who are just beginning to research why they are adult children it will do.
4,Interesting,"I've purchased many books by Janet Woititz and have not been disappointed. If you're an adult child of an alcholic, this book can help. However, I suggest you start with reading Woititz's book ""Adult Children of Alcholics""."
4,A really clear explanation,"This book presents IPv6 in an organized way. It explains how it works and what problems it solves. It's a nice book for students and if you know nothing about it, you don't need other books."
3,good for intro but...,"this book provides a good intro to the protocol, but for more details, look into christian huitema's IPv6 2nd ed. and other rfc's."
3,ok not up to date,"The book is ok to get some basics about IPV6 and a lot about IPV6 history. I read the book and I did learn some. I would think there are books out there that are newer. I think the latest date in the book is 2004. When the book discusses computers, the references are for Vista as the newest release.I also think the book could be about 1/2 the size."
5,This one should get six stars,"This concert DVD is one of the best things I have ever seen. The camera work is perfect and there is good visual work with the video lightshow. The setlist is basically perfect with maybe one exception. SetI Bertha//Cold Rain and Snow//Red Rooster//When Push come to shove//Masterpiece// Birdsong//Music never stopped Set II Hell in a Bucket//Uncle John's//Terrapin (2 tracks)// Drumzspace//Other 1//Wharf Rat//Throwing Stones// Not Fade Away//E:Knockin' w/Neville's. So as you can see the song selection is meaty and Jerry's face is HUGE!! This one is a must purchase and other bands such as Phish, Dave Matthews, and Widespread Panic should start makin' em like this. Enough said"
2,reat music ..horrible graphics,"A great set by the Dead ruined by awful graphics that totally obscure the band, especially cut 18, intro to the Other One, and 19, The Other One. Some of the most complicated music on the DVD and the players are completely obliteratd by lousy graphics. Its almost as if someone assumed we wanted to see crappy graphics rather than top-notch playing. The music on the DVD is great, the graphics that obsucre the musicians suck."
4,Not a bad show,"In reference to the editors note, there is no Dark Star on this DVD! The Dead merely trickle into The Other One coming out of Drumz. The show on the whole is well played but I agree with the other reviewer about the exclusion of a great 3rd set with the Neville Brothers! One more note, the opening Bertha is good but the editors, for some reason, lopped off the the Bobby opener of Promised! Who knows? Anyway, like any dead video, digital or otherwise, this is a must have for your libray, enjoy and keep the faith!"
4,"groovy, man","Bob Weir shreds on this one. Consistent groovin; grooviness from the masters of groove. Brent Mydland chops away at his keyboards earning the title of master groovemaster. Mickey Hart and the other guy with the K name show how cool it is when you can fill constantly. They never get bored! Cherry Garcia's leads are great, although this video shows how little lyhe puts into some of his writing collaborations lyrically on ""When Push Comes To Shove."" Phil Lesh must be the grooviest one though, with his solid rock bassing. The audio mix is great, better than View From the Vault 2 by no stretch at all. K drummer's toms are not mixed in hardly, but the snares, kicks, and cymbals of both resonate with a fury that cannot be tamed."
3,Good sound but poor setlist,"This concert does not feature the best setlist imaginable. But when the music is good it is excellent, such as ""Bird Song"" and ""Other One."" Another problem with this video is the camera ""special effects"" which bogg down the music. I personally want to see Garcia play, not swirls and other things like that. This video, however, is a must own for any deadhead, or those wanting to relive the experiance in the comfort of ones own couch."
2,"See ""Down Hill From Here""","I was at this show, What a blast. New Years Eve was always the clunkiest show of the run, from a musical stand point, but NYE was always about more than just the show. They started this show a little sluggish. By the time the video reaches the parts where they are warmed up in full stride, you can't see anything because some one decided to put tracer effects and fotage of WWII in the way, (I kid you not) the post production video effects are about as nice as the strings they used to attatch to pop songs of the mid 60s. Either show us the footage or don't. The 1989 Alpine vid on the other hand is the real deal. It will blow you away."
5,"Treat yourself to this album, you won't regret it.","This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Every track is a real treat, especially Brashear's originals. He's backed by some all star bluegrass musician's who are all tasteful, Peter McLaughlin, Jody Stecher, Laurie Lewis, Ed Neff and Bob Black. Together they produce a solid band sound that is original, creative and very enjoyable. I have no criticism's of this album and highly recommend it. Treat yourself to this gem, I'm certain it will become one of your favorites."
4,A VERY PLEASANT COMEDY,"The price is a little steep for foreigners (plus shipping and taxes) but reasonable in the US.TONY RANDALL was an outstanding actor, capable of bringing nuances into farce. Besides the excellent PAUL DOUGLAS, we find CHARLES LANE, an old hand, usually in newspapermen roles, and SMILEY BURNETTE, ex western sidekick, both known for their parts in PETTICOAT JUNCTION. And FRED CLARK usually a long suffering character,clinging to his dignity.The CINEMASCOPE photography is excellent. GEORGE MARSHALL was an old hand ,since 1916, with many hits in his career.The picture is supposed to be based on THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY, a nice novel by (British) H.E. BATES, later a British TV series.There is nothing to add to the good summary by Amazon.Enjoy!"
5,One of the all-time great comedies,"This is Tony Randall at his best -- with a tremendous supporting cast and a hilarious storyline. It's a great summer movie that works well year-round, a chick flick that's not just for chicks. A classic."
5,silly but nostalgic,I always enjoy this movie. Debbie at her most frenetic and Tony Randall at his buttoned-up best. First saw this as a teenager when these movies were big hits. Still enjoy it. A bit of nostalgia never hurts.
5,No one makes puzzles like Melissa & Doug!,"We bought these for our daughter back when she was three - she's always been huge into puzzles. While this says 6 and up, she is more than capable of having a blast with these puzzles.Colors are vibrant and the puzzles are well-made. They are a blast to put together - we point out all the animals and count them...and can identify the planets now. I wish they made more of these puzzles, they're so great!"
4,FIRE,"The Diplomats have once again come with a banger for the streets and unlike the last Diplomats album, Cam is a lot more songs, the first 6 to be exact. Hell Rell does his thing as usual, and J.R. Writer is stepping up his game as well. There are also good efforts from 40 Cal, Jim Jones, Juelz Santana, Max B., and A-Mafia. Overall I give it 4 Stars because I would have liked to see more of the other Diplomat members and some production from the Heatmakerz, but I am very satisfied with this release the beats are fire, and ""White Girls"" is an instant classic Cam at his best. ONE..."
5,"Crisp, Lively, and Unique","Ms. Crusie's an outstanding author! She creates a world full of characters and situations that kept my fingers turning the pages. I laughed, got angry, and was amused. Ms. Crusie has a way of threading her characters' lives into one another's that kept me spellbound. Her snappy ""he said,"" then ""she said""'s in the same paragraph always made me chuckle - it kept in sync with the tone for the whole book.She made me FEEL in one way or another for every one of her characters - Katie, especially, made me feel joyous to downhearted - I just wanted to pick her up and hold her no matter the wet consequences. And the passion Quinn had for Katie and the way she grew stronger in making change in her own life tickled me and made me want to cheer.What a read! Didn't think I was going to like such ""plain folk,"" in a romance novel, but there's no way I couldn't.Thank you Ms. Crusie! What a delightful read!"
4,Fun and Funny,I had lots of fun with this book. The small-town was a great setting and she handled it well. The villain Bill was fascinating. It was interesting to see a perfectly normal guy descend into stalking behavior. Looking forward to another book by this author.
2,A Repeat of Tell Me Lies,"If you want to reread Tell Me Lies, then read this book. The plot, the characters, the foibles, the passions - everything is the same except for some name changes. I found Tell Me Lies to be original, hysterical, beautifully written, captivating - but why write an identical book? I know it must be difficult to break from your artistic style, i.e., groups like Boston (oh oh, showing my age!) in which every song sounds like the previous one! That said, based on Tell Me Lies, I still look forward to Jennifer's next book."
5,Funny!,If you want to chuckle and laugh at the absurdity of life read this book! Jennifer Cruisie wrote a delightful book about a woman who decided that her life was indeed hers and she goes about declaring it. A wonderful and entertaining story with a cast of characters that are equally endearing.
5,I just love Crusie! **10 stars**,"This book was so great! As always, Crusie gives you main characters you can really relate to. I found myself cheering them on and smiling at every turn. Once you pick it up, you will not be able to put it down! You really accept the characters into your heart, I hated to see this book end! Funny, kooky and downright spooky (wow, what an ex from Hell!) You will love it! Try all of Crusie's books, she is my most favorite author by far. She will win you over, too! Just wait"
2,"Strange mix for a ""romantic romp""?","I must be missing something here. Although I found the characters well defined and the dialogue sexy and lively, I had trouble relating to any of them. I found the women to be petty, bitter whinners and the men to be pathetic imbeciles. The only one who knew what they wanted was Bill and he turned out to be an abusive stalker. This is my first book by Ms. Cruise. I'm willing to try another one to see if its me or the author."
1,Very Disappointed,"It looks like I'm going to be the voice of dissent here. But just coming down from the high of reading ""Watermelon"", I was sure ""Crazy For You"" would be the perfect choice for my next read. Wrong! For far too much of the novel the ""villian"" is too pathetic and lost to be the least bit threatening. When Crusie finally turns up the heat the end is already crystal clear. Great sex scenes....but I stopped reading romances just for those scenes around high school. The rest predictable and flat. I'm thankful I only invested in a trip to the library on this one. For a great break-up-and-change-life-for-the-better romance try Marian Keye's ""Watermelon"" and for a great romantic suspence with wonderful tension try Karen Robards ""Hunter's Moon""."
5,Agree with valerietaylor@poboxes.com!,"Absolutely--this is Crusie's best, and that's saying a mouthful. This book is sheer fun, notwithstanding the genuinely creepy ex-boyfriend who won't take no for an answer. Nobody writes like Crusie; her voice is unique, utterly charming, and you can hear it a mile away. She really is a treasure."
1,"You can't win 'em all, Jen","Maybe I shouldn't have read two early Crusies in a row -- ""Getting Rid of Bradley"" was great fun -- because ""Crazy for You"" almost made ME crazy! Quite dull, jumping all over the place with several different characters and a hero and heroine that were completely uninteresting. I guess what she wanted was small town charm, but it came out as big time boring.Nick just seemed like an old hound, living in a crappy apartment, drinking beer and dating twentysomethings. If he weren't ""gorgeous,"" would any self-respecting woman go near him?Quinn was a dope. She had no spine and is such a wimp. I can't believe she is viciously attacked by Bill, who is clearly mentally deranged, AND SHE WAITS UNTIL THE NEXT DAY TO GO TO THE POLICE???? How dumb is that? And to hear the characters say ""Oh, hell"" a thousand times got real old, real fast.Get any other book, ""Bradley,"" ""Manhunting,"" or ""Anyone But You"" if you want vintage Crusie.This one was a dud."
1,Ugh. Terrible.,"This was my first (and last) Jennifer Cruise book. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich, and was looking for something to read while awaiting her most recent installment. Several people suggested Jennifer Cruise to me as an alternative. I was totally underwhelmed and unimpressed by her writing. Weak plot, lame characters, and tacky sex (in a high school, no less). What is there to like about this book? I managed to make it through the entire book, but was extremely thankful I had checked it out from the library. Needless to say, I won't be reading any of her other books."
1,Same book????!!!,"Are we talking about the same book? It happens to be the most boring book I have ever come across. It took me almost 3 weeks to finish it. In fact, I had to struggle to finish reading it. Very disappointing. I wonder why it's getting such good reviews."
4,Award winning fun read,"I checked this book out from the library because it had more critical acclaim than any romance in a long time. The list is impressive: Romantic Times/Reviewer Choice nominee; Rita nominee; Romance Reader top five and Romance Writers Reader Choice top 10. Is it that good? Almost.The story is pretty real world. A school teacher whose desire to liven up her life becomes infectious. I'm sure many of us married women can relate to Darla as she tries to rekindle the spark in her 17 year old marriage.I'm holding back a star because there are times in this book where I really wanted to tell the characters to wake up and smell the coffee. Still, lots of fun - a great vacation read."
4,A laugh riot,"Jennifer Crusie will not disappoint. Once a ""mere"" paperback romance writer who no one had ever heard of, she's made a move into the mainstream, and has done so successfully. Her chararcters are real--flawed, unpredictable, and absolutely hilarious. If you enjoyed ""Crazy for You,"" then ""Tell Me Lies"" is a must-read."
4,Refreshing,"I'm a big fan of Jennifer Crusie since reading Tell Me Lies and Welcome to Temptation. But I must say that my favourite so far of hers is Crazy for You. She has combined an excellent blend of romantic emotion (I love it when the guy has been burning away with a unrequited love for a long time), humour and suspense. A very good contemporary novel if you're trying to get away from the run of the mill romance."
2,Crazy for You,"Well I certainly was not 'crazy' for this book.It had all the eliments to make it great, but somehow just kept missing.Truly a disappointment after Tell Me Lies, which was a 6 star book if there ever was one.I still gave 2 stars, because the characters were all filled out, and the story line was a fun one, it was just somehow, not quite together.Lets hope her next one is more like her first book."
1,disappointing mix,"I wanted to like this book, but somehow I just didn't. The mix of tacky sex, limp suspense, and contrived romance really didn't work for me."
4,"Good, funny book","""Crazy for You"" is the first book I have read from Jennifer Crusie and I only picked it up after reading good reviews from Amazon.[com.] I have to admit she is fast becoming one of my favourite contemporary-romance author!""Crazy for You"" is sexy and witty and the conversation between characters are funny as well. Besides liking the part about Nick and Quinn, (Duh, who doesn't?! But it helps that Nick is super-hot and Quinn is so lovable,) I also really liked the part about Max and Darla. Throw in the part about Quinn's ex,Bill, an ex-boyfriend-turned-freaky-stalker, and you have the perfect read filled with romance, steamy sex, and just a bit of suspense.""Crazy for You"" is recommended to everyone. Need I say more?"
2,2 stars,"This is my 3rd Crusie book and I had just finished Fast Women which I really liked. As I started getting into this book, it felt like deja vu. Quinn and her ratdog was like Nel and her Sugarpie. Darla was another Suzie from Fast Women. Both stories took place in small towns where everyone was somehow connected. Darla and Quinn both looking for that ""zing"" in their life, the passion they both needed. Like other reviewers, I actually liked Darla more than Quinn. But I have yet to finish this book. In most Crusie books, I think the supporting characters are actually better than the main heroine.So 2 stars because of the recycled material. I will continue to read Crusie as long as each story is different and unique from the last."
3,"Okay, but not what I'd hoped","I only wish the book was as good as the synopsis on the back, which I considered hilarious. The supposed humor in this book rarely gave me more than a smile. Maybe I just didn't get it... I can think of many other books that made me laugh more than this one did.Like a previous reviewer, I, too, appreciate the use of ordinary people in ordinary towns and circumstances. Too many romances are about the beautiful people of a given age/location, so this was a refreshing change."
2,Repetitive and inane,"I was disappointed with this book. The dialogue is often unimaginative and silly...repetitious phrases like ""her hair like copper silk,"" ""warm and round,"" and ""oh hell"" got old fast, and the plot didn't seem important. The characters were flat and the book just didn't get going for me...if Quinn was so exciting and wonderful, what was she doing with that dork Bill in the first place? Just change boyfriends and get over it, will ya? Similarly, the Nick character's reasoning that kept him away from Quinn was just stupid; a vague threat from his ex-wife 20 years ago kept his simmering love at bay? Quinn is 35 years old, and he's nearly 40 for goodness sake! Get real! I even found the dog irritating! My advice to the author: Invest in a thesaurus and work on character development. Guess I'm just not a fan of ""light romance."""
2,Not Good,"I agree with another reader - were we all reading the same book. I was really looking forward to this book. I've read other Crusie books & loved them & this book had great reviews. But I was thoroughly dissappointed - bad in every way. The plot was lame, the characters were lame....lame, lame, lame. And have I mentioned boring? I do not recommend this book. Neither do I recommend ""Getting Rid of Bradley"" or ""Charlie All Night"". But I have read a few greats by Crusie - I RECOMMEND: ""Bet Me"" and ""Welcome to Temptation""."
5,This book makes me smile;),"What a delightful read!! Quinn and Nick are so down to earth, as are all the people we meet from Tibbett, OH. Lots of little twists and turns, all so human and believeable! Sometimes I feel like Darla, I love my husband, but after 10 years, things get stale at times. I can't wait to read more Cruise books and meet new characters!!"
4,Fun book,"This is a fun book with a real plot to it.Quinn is a boring, safe, school teacher and she is sick and tired of her life. She decides to make some changes. She gets a dog, dumps her boyfriend and buys a house. Her taking chances in her life, inspires people around her to do the same. The ripple effect is great -- from her mom to her best friend (I don't want to give away too much!).Her ex-boyfriend's character is a bit over the top -- unbelievable and then just not enjoyable to the story anymore. I think it was a great book w/o all his drama, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. But it is a fun, quick, enjoyable read."
5,"A Hilarious, Fun Read","This book is such a fun, playful read! I could not put this book down once I got passed the halfway mark. Jennifer Cruise is a great author and I am her new biggest fan. Keep them coming Ms. Cruise! Your time will not be wasted on this book, it will keep you interested and laughing!"
5,Crazy about this book!,"I thought this book was fabulous and nearly perfect. I thought ALL the elements worked. The humor and romance were perfection itself and Bill's descent into near madness was one of the most compelling and logical I've ever read because it made so much sense to him. Every character in Tibbett rang true with genuine depth and charm. I didn't want to put the book down and when I did, I couldn't find anything else nearly as wonderful to read. This is my favorite Jennifer Crusie book to date! She's earned a lifelong fan with this marvelous novel."
3,"A sexy, enjoyable glimpse of the ""other side.""","So this confetti cover catches my eye. What kind of book gets this kind of weird cover? As a man, if it's a ""woman's book,"" I won't be interested.When I look inside I see sex - good stuff, with both emotions and sensations - from a woman's viewpoint. Is this for real? Most woman novelists are too indirect. But, checking the author photo, it was written by a real live woman. Just maybe, if I read this, I can get a glimpse of sex from the ""other side.""And I read it, enjoying the sex as expected. And I do get to see the other side, not just the sex part either. Yes, it's a little romancy contrived - but not enough to spoil the fun. So why only three stars? Well, Steinbeck gets five. I'm sure Jennifer will understand. She does, after all, have a passionate sense of humor."
3,Crazy For You,"This is a cute story but not as interesting as her other books that I have read. The characters are not as fascinating as they were in Agnes and the Hitman, but are interesting. It seemed like the adults were still living their lives like they were still high school students.I don't want to give away the plot but there are definitely turns and twists that do keep you reading. It is worth buying at the prices Amazon offers."
3,"Good book, but a slow read","I enjoyed this book. It has a nice storyline; however, it has a very slow beginning. The end really picked up though. It ended up being a great story. I liked Quinn a lot. She was a great character. The only thing about the book is that I got really distracted with Quinn's obsession over the dog. I think the dog part of the story was taking away from the romance that was developing between Quinn and Nick. She was so obsessed with the dog for most of the book that Nick didn't matter too much until the end. I would have enjoyed some more romance. Reading a book entitled, Crazy for you, I thought it would have been more about a steamy, exciting relationship than a dog. Even with the dog storyline, I do have to admit that I still liked the book. If you are looking for a good book, with not a lot of sex, but a pretty decent storyline, this one is for you."
3,A good read,"I haven't not liked a Jennifer Crusie book, and I've read four of them now. They involve you right from the start, with three dimensional characters, laughter, drama, and quite a few twists to keep you guessing. Ms Crusie's books won't change your life, but they're a fine way to while away an afternoon or two. More please!"
4,Oh Hell!,"I enjoyed reading this book but have one complaint. Everytime ANYTHING happens, the characters think ""Oh hell."" This sometimes occurs several times on one page.It got to the point where anytime someone said or thought ""Oh hell"", it made me cringe.I mean, do you use the exact same phrases as everyone else you know? Couldn't some of the characters say ""Oh crap"" or ""Uh oh"" or anything but ""Oh hell""???Other than that annoyance, the book was good, easy, light reading. None of the characters are especially deep, but you don't expect that from these types of books. :)Crystal"
1,Only interesting if you are in junior high,"I bought this book because I thought it might be a fun read but I was terribly disappointed. The characters are one-dimensional and extremely boring and the plot is riduculously stupid. The ending is something like you might read in one of my seventh grade students' favorite books. As a teacher, I felt that Quinn and Bill's professional lives were nothing like any teacher I know. I'm a dog lover and I didn't even like the dog. If you feel compelled to read this book just grab one of the Sweet Valley High Series books--they are a quicker read and will leave you about as fulfilled."
4,Hysterical Romance,"This amusing love story kept me interested from start to finish. It was hard to put down. Comedy, Romance, and Suspense rolled into a delightful package."
5,"fascinating fiction, but not really fiction","Dion Fortune is one of the best occult writers of all times. She has not been surpassed by the younger generations. This book contains case-stories from Doctor Taverner's private hospital, something like a nursing home or general sanatorium where he looks after some very interesting patients. In each of the stories different esoteric phenomena are analysed, and the author's descriptions of both the symptoms and the doctor's decisions about each case are fascinatingly constructed. She (Dion Fortune) has a sophisticated, ironic literary style. In this intangible world of spiritual, karmic, astral-mental factors that co-exist around each patient, the author never looses her fine sense of reality. Very good British common sense, let us say. There is sense of humor, there is depth, there is love and punishment, vampires and strange ""nature beings"" in the collection ... I absolutely love this book."
5,This could be a movie or series!,"I have always loved this collection of stories. Over the years, I have read them over and over again. Dr. Taverner really is like a true, metaphysical, occult Sherlock Holmes. What's more, they are based on a real character that Dion Fortune actually knew - and there are many elements in these stories that are true in the occult world! These stories are even better than Madame Blavatsky's ""Nightmare Tales"" - and they would make a fascinating occult adventure feature film or TV series (how about BBC America or SyFy?) - if done right."
4,Great chemistry,"Matt and Catherine are a great couple -- even if they're having trouble convincing each other! One of the most likeable elements is their history together. Rather than being two strangers falling in love almost instantaneously, they grew up together. An interesting twist on the girl-next-door phenomenon.And, the family dynamics are great -- a bewildered mother and meddling brother. I came to love this family and rooted for Matt and Catherine throughout."
2,Rather Disappointing....,"I originally ordered this book online bcs. I loved reading ""The Diamond Girl""(another book by DP) & thought this book'd be similarly good since it had a similar title, but I've regretted this decision bitter ever since I've received & read it.... (This one wasn't even half as emotional-gripping/sensual as ""The Diamond Girl""....)"
1,Hm...,"I didn't like it much, and after reading this book I don't think I'll buy anymore of this author.I didn't feel like the characters was in love. The man was more like a father.The characthers was not developing much and the books seemed like not having any deep meaning. After reading half of the book it didn't seem like anything had happened.I was really dissapointed after reading the reviews and I thought that it mush be a really good book anyway if I can I won't even give it one star.I'm sorry and I hope I didn't offend the ones that loves this book, I just want to say what I thought."
4,Atmospheric,"Set in Riga, Latvia and Ystad, Sweden towards the end of the Soviet era, this book centers on police detective Kurt Wallander in his quest to solve the case of two bodies that have washed up on-shore. It was a pleasure to read this book while traveling in Riga, as I was able to visualize many of the settings. This book is a murder mystery but much more- atmospheric (almost to the extreme)."
3,Doesn't measure up to his debut novel,"One of the pleasures of reading the Wallander series is the insights we get into modern Swedish society. In this novel, Mankell sends Wallander to Riga, a location with which Mankell clearly is less familiar. As a result, the writing in the last half of the novel is a bit forced and formulaic. It's still worth reading, but not up to the standards set by Faceless Killers."
4,Very good,"At a time I wondered if this ""Mystery Novel"" was going to become a spy novel instead but it's still very good. The translation could be better though. I'm already readingThe White Lioness: A Kurt Wallander Mystery (3)"
4,Less plausible than other Wallander stories,"I'd read three other Wallander adventures before reading The Dogs of Riga. While the story has the same gloomy Swedish atmosphere I enjoy in the other stories, it didn't feel as plausible as the others I've read. This is the case where Wallander meets Baiba Liepa, who appears in subsequent books. His adventures in Latvia are detailed but feel less well-informed than usual in Mankell's novels. That may be because I'm not at all familiar with the political situation in Latvia in 1992, or because Mankell himself was not as familiar with it as he is with southern Sweden."
2,Poor writing or bad translation?,"This is the second book by this author that I have read and am constantly dragged down by the awkward writing. The story line was interesting, but the language was flat and terse. The books do not exhibit a sense of location or richness of characters. It is as bland and colorless as a winter landscape. Perhaps that's the intention. I wonder if the author is a poor writer or if the translation is just bad. Perhaps a Swedish reader could elucidate."
4,One of the Best Wallander Books,"This is as good of a thriller as one is likely ever to read. A first-rate work with awesome settings and exciting twists and turns, it will leave a reader exhausted and enlivened."
4,Completely Won Over,"I do not have much experience in the detective genre, but I was fascinated by the series on PBS, so i decided to try the books. The books are even better than the PBS series, and I thought the PBS series was superb. I plan on reading the entire series now."
3,"good, not great","Mankell's Wallender books are always good. Among the five I've read, this is my least well liked, probably because of the unfamiliar, and for me, difficult to imagine landscape."
4,More of the same,"I read other book from the series before and by The Dogs of Riga I was already used to the pace of Mankell`s stories. This one, though, was more interesting than the rest."
2,Disappointing - Dogs of Riga,"Perhaps it is unfortunate that this is the only Henning Mankell book I have read, because I would never read another of his ""mysteries"" after this. Having been rather disappointed by the PBS renderings of his works, I now commend them on making them as interesting as they can.What a dull book this is. Perhaps if written as a very short story, it would have been OK. But the characters and situations are dull, the plot almost non-existent, and little or no suspense for the reader. I finished this book only because I wanted to see if in the ending there would be something which made it worthy of publication. Sadly, there was none. Save you money and time, if you like tightly constructed and well written mysteries."
2,Come on -- let's get real,"OK, I'm not going to give away the ending. But here is the plot. Two men are found dead in a liferaft, apparently with expensive clothes put on them after death. This is a mystery that isn't solved. A Latvian cop is killed and for some reason, the Latvian police call on Kurt Wallender -- who is Swedish and speaks not a word of Latvian -- to cross the Baltic and solve their crime. Good investigative technique -- interview people who don't speak your language. But that's the premise of this book, and it makes no sense at all! Okay, so it is dark and brooding and Scandinavian, but give me a break. At least give us some kind of plot to make us suspend disbelief (This may be easier in Sweden where everyone drinks, smokes, drinks coffee and commits suicide.) It is well written but you've got to have a plot. Oh yes, in the end the solution comes from out of nowhere after Wallender has messed it up."
2,Great idea but simplistic,"The setting and the characters promise a great read. And while the books is easy to get thru and diverting enuf, it is far toosimplistic and predictable; like a TV crime episode. There are far too many far-fetched turns to make it believable. The basic political tenet is never really explained or backgrounded. This is a great shame as the book's theme and characters hold so much promise."
1,A disappointment,"Two dimensional characters, predictable plot, tedious attempts at suspense and a lazy, poorly-crafted plot. A friend recommended Henning Mankell when I asked for suggestions in the spirit of early John LeCarre. I was looking for psychological depth and an intriguing puzzle whose answer emerges gradually, delivered in first rate prose. This is Not Not Not that book. I recommend you look elsewhere (perhaps Alan Furst is the answer - I'm going to try him next)."
3,European Blues,"The Berlin Wall has fallen and the East is opening up. An Inflatable dinghy drifts ashore in Sweden, and with it two dead men. It becomes Inspector Wallander&#65533;s case. Who are these two men? Their dental work suggests east European origin; the dinghy was made in Yugoslavia. Wallander keeps digging, and his investigation leads him to Riga.City and country of Intrigue, deception, corruption and murder. Willander is like the ivory ball on a billiard table, pushed in one direction and rebounding in an other. He solves the case, at great danger to himself.Mankell has a habit of inserting his political convictions into his books - be it the sorry welfare state of Sweden, be it the flowers of evil blooming in the newly liberated East. I do not believe that a mystery should be the dais for politics."
1,"Just an awful, overrated book","The characters are dull, uninteresting, and unlikeable, while the plot is incoherent and contrived. The main political point manages to be even worse, especially when you take into account Mankell's reprehensible views on the Middle East conflict. Do yourself a favor and skip this racist's petty excuse for a novel."
3,"Entertaining story, but too many twists and turns","This time inspector Kurt Wallander has to solve the murder on two very well-dressed men, who float ashore the Swedish coast on a raft. The trail leads to Latvia. After his Latvian colleague is also murdered, Wallander ends up in a web of intrigues in an unstable country that is unknown to him and where he does not speak the language. Soon he finds out that one of his two nearest Latvian colleagues is the villain, but which one of the two?In contrast to &#65533;Faceless killers&#65533; by the same author, this book contains much more action, but after a while I became quite dizzy with all the twist and turns that the story took. It is an entertaining story, but Wallander appeared less real to me than in the previous book."
3,Ok Wallander,It is just ok thats all. Not a bad one but his later books are much better. This series can be read out of sequence so start further on.
5,visceral tale,"In typical Mankell style, The Dogs is visceral in every way. We are made to feel all of the fear and uncertainty that goes with Eastern bloc countries in the early nineties. We even feel Wallender's discomfort upon donning woolen long johns in riga. Brilliant plot, with the outcome in doubt right up to the shootout on the roof of the department store."
1,Very boring!,"What did we expect, it's a game of hot potato, right? Somehow for the $$ we expected a little more fun. It is VERY lame! Save you money andd just use an actual hot potato."
5,tiedied,"ahh yes a great album, and a fun group to travel with with, even if it was Pensicola. This album remains somewhat timeless, I still listen to Pennywise, and five by nine as well. Don't give up guys, wherever you are. (Do you live here Jason?)TY DYE"
4,"Old Fashioned Gospel Songs from ""Old"" Artists!","If you like Gospel music and if you like Country, this CD will probably please you! ""Sweet By and By"" by the Statler Brothers is especially nice. The familiar voice of Roy Acuff singing ""Take My Hand Precious Lord"" sort of gave me goosebumps. Even though Jerry Lee Lewis is not a favorite artist of mine, he did a superb job of ""He Looked Beyond My Fault"". The Five different artists/groups on this one CD give you a good amount of listening pleasure. I would place this music a cut above some of the other Gospel mixed artist recordings, but definitely not the quality of the Gaither Groups."
5,Excellent from Order to Arrival,I was completely satisfied with the order I placed with Joe's Games and More. He had exactly what I was looking for and I received my order well before the scheduled date. Prompt service and customer satisfaction are the cornerstone of a great business and He's got both. I highly recommend Joe's. as I know I will be a return customer.
4,Great for hot rollers,I use this before setting my hair and it adds a nice hold. Definitly gives you more control and hold without being sticky.
4,Best I've tried so far.....,"Have long, fine hair...& am now using this with my hot rollers...The Redken product made my hair positively CRUNCHY..(Tossed it out!).. This bottle is pretty small for someone with long hair, but gotta have something. It keeps the curls pretty well and adds some shine. Will keep using till I find something better...."
5,Angel,"A great book! At first I was Oh My God, but once your into it the book is fantastic!!! I saw alot of me and other friends. I recommend this book!"
5,author JOEL ROTHSCHILD says this is a great read,WOW this is a beautiful and read. It is very powerful. I am one of the longest living AIDS survivors in the world and this inspired me. Some of it is similar to my own book SIGNALS. You will love this book
3,Formalism in the name of spirituality,"I've been interested in Buddhism for many years, but never really looked into Zen specifically. I tried this book on the recommendation of a friend. I had high hopes for it based on his recommendation, but I found it extremely disappointing. The first chapter really explains my major gripes with the book. In it he states that the most important part of Buddhism (not specifically Zen, Buddhism) is to meditate with a perfectly erect spine, and that this act of sitting with an erect spine is meditation, is Buddhism, and that there is no necessary mental component, no special breathing, nothing but sitting in this fashion.That's absurd. Its mindless formalism for the sake of formalism. Posture, while nice and helpful is not the point of meditation, and certainly not the point of Buddhism. I think he has an unhealthy attachment to the position of his body and the continuation of acts in accordance with his tradition.Otherwise, I have no problem with him."
3,"Yes, if you are a practicioner...",I read this book with curiosity and awe!I am confident that Suzuki is a person of great depth however reading the book isn't much of a substitute to hearing his teachings first-hand. It is made clear that the talks he gave (which are summarised in this book) would follow Zen meditation by his group and the talks themselves don't mean anything without the support of the sitting exercise: zazen.
4,Great Place to Start,I loved the simple but clear presentation on Zen Buddhist practice. This book would be helpful even to those with no interest in Zen practice.
5,THE BOOK THAT STARTED IT ALL!,"For me, at least. It was the gift of this book that set me on the course of living rightly. Even though I am not a Zen student, the lessons of Zen apply to all Buddhist seekers, and I am eternally grateful that I encountered this unpretentious, wonderful little book."
5,Catches the essence of meditation practice,"This book with its short chapters catches the essence of meditation practice. In its short chapters, it provides useful lessons on different topics. Beginner's mind is the point, original mind with no goal of attainment. I recommend this book to beginner and experienced meditators."
4,Its all a state of mind,"Very interesting book, I'm just starting to get into the whole Zen mind thing and feel this book was a great help. A lot of interesting philosophy and advice. I recommend it for any avid reader that's trying to expand there own mind and reach a higher level of peace and enlightenment."
5,A Classic to be Read Again and Again,"I first read this book years ago, as a complete novice on the spiritual path. While there was a lot I didn't understand, I appreciated Shunryu Suzuki's quiet wisdom, gentle humor, and clear and simple meditation instructions. Every few years I find myself revisiting it, and every time I get more out of it.Zen is simple, counterintuitive, and profound. In another work, Suzuki says ""just to be alive is enough,"" and that pretty much sums it up. We spend so much of our lives wanting things to be different instead of just appeciating life as it is. Roshi's words consistently bring us back to that critical point.While there are a lot of books that talk about the importance of being in the moment (The Power of Now comes to mind), this one is the one that I always seem to pull off the shelf."
5,a great book and even better b/c you can find it free online,"Again, I'll make this review very quick. A great book, although sometimes comfusing with apparently paradoxical language (which is fairly commen in zen buddhism). That aside, this book can be very helpful for beginner as well as long-practicing buddhists. It is especially helpful for any home-practicing buddhist out there who do not have the added benefit of a zendo nearby. An even better bonus is that it can be found online for free if you look hard enough. cheers."
2,Kind of too Japanese,"Although I know this is a classic, I'm not sure it works for the truly beginning practitioner, as you probably won't get most of it. Another book I read recently, Open Mind Zen, was much better for a Western beginner than this one was. I still enjoyed reading it, though."
3,A little hard to get through.,I bought it because Steve Jobs liked it. Guess I am not into Zen. Haven't finished it yet. Maybe it will get better.
3,Confused,Maybe it's just me and i am not understanding the deeper meaning of the book. I found a lot of the sentences hard to interpret; pretty much the majority of the book.Besides that the basic statement portrayed in this book is great.
1,Dissapointing,"I read all the positive reviews about this book and thought I couldn't go wrong by purchasing it. I also looked at the negative reviews but the positive so heavily outweighed the negative I decided to trust those. Unfortunately I wish I would have paid closer attention to the 1 star reviews as now I have a book to toss into our next garage sale. If this is the best way that Zen can be explained then I'm not embarrased to say I don't get it, don't think I'll ever get it, and don't care anymore (or wait...does that mean that I actually do get it?). I can see from the swarming responses to the other 1 star reviews that I can expect this review to be pounced on by the books defenders. I mean no disrespect to the author, and if you can get something out of it good for you. But after re-reading some entries repeatedly to ensure I wasn't missing anything I interpret this to be mostly nonsense."
2,Nothing Special...,"Does not really touch a whole lot on Buddhism teachings and believes, it does have few good concepts but in all very theoretical, boring to read and a very BEGINNER'S MIND approach.I was looking forward to more knowledge, something that would really think and reflect on new horizons.If you are really interested in Zen teaching, and want some very light no challenge whatsoever, give it a shot. It could be a start..."
5,"WONDERFUL, PEACEFUL, WELL DONE",A classic! A very well spoken audio cassette to present one of the great books on Zen in a classic way. This is a great treasure and to hear this is a reaffirmation of the author's tremendous knowledge of the subect. Easy enough to understand. !!!!!!!!!!!
5,I've been reading this book for 25 years,"And I'm still reading it. It's like a different book every time I pick it up. Like most Buddhist teachings, you might notice more and more refined subtlety as you go along. Along side it, I've also been sitting every day. I recommend the book...(well, and sitting for that matter...) Not just to folks curious about Zen but to anybody who is curious at all."
4,Simple reading about Zen,"This book is simple reading for those who know nothing about Zen. Though, the less you know the better, according to this book. You can read one paragraph at a time and set the book down for a month (though you most likely won't) and continue having lost nothing. Also suggest you read ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Eastern Wisdom"" by Taro Gold, which makes a great companion book on the path to learning about Buddhism."
5,the best zen book,"there are other books, but this is by far the best I have read on the subject of zen. do not hesitate to read it."
3,"Esoteric, but informative","While I have read many books on Zen that I found give a better understanding of the overall philosophy, this one gave a different point of view that I was thankful for. It was often at odds with its own statements and did not always eloquently present its points, but it does allow for a deeper understanding of Zen for a student who has already been thoroughly introduced to its principles."
4,"Good, but not for beginners","This is an excellent book for experienced students of Zen and Buddhism. Beginners may find it redundant and over instructive. But then again, I'm not a beginner. :-)"
5,"Very interesting, spiritual and enlightening",This book was recommended to me by my meditation teacher. I am enjoying it very much. There are many thought provoking concepts.
3,I read it and it was interesting.,"The book was good for an overview of Zen Buddhism. Easy reading, easy to follow. Highly recommended for all spiritual libraries."
4,Introducing Zen to the western world,"I found this book accurate, interesting and enlightening (no pun intended). I have been studying Zen meditation with a Zen Buddhist monk for a short time and found this book to accurately echo the basic teachings I have been learning. The lessons in the book are clearly explained, and as the title depicts, even a beginner's mind will get the messages without any trouble. Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind is excellent for the Zen novice, but I'm sure even practiced Zen students will learn something from the simple, beautifully written text."
5,Meditator's Handbook,"I purchased this book in 1985 when I began meditating. It has been my closest companion ever since. I also own the audio tapes - now completely worn out from listening and re-listening to this book. I can't recommend any book more highly than this one for those seeking to develop themselves through meditation.Over thirty years of meditation, and I was so fortunate to get this book at the start. This book became the heart of me, and I often recommend it to others."
1,This planet please.... don't do this unless you are into philosophy big time.,I read with interest all the other reviews and thought this would be a good book to get some insight into Zen meditation. Please...... what a joke. The most obvious thing is that there are no drawings to help with various poses that are mentioned in the book. It would help to make sure you are interpretating the instructions correctly to have a drawing or better yet a picture as a reference. Nooooooo.... that would be neither here nor there. If you understand that then you have this Zen thing down. There is nothing beginning like about this book and further more the examples don't really get over the concepts very well. Well although there is no good or bad in the Zen world... in my world there is and this is it. It stinks to high heaven. I expect my tirade can be taken either way by you Zen masters.
2,A negative spin on Zen,"This book did more damage to my understanding of Zen than anything I have read. Shunryu Suzuki I would classify as a ""scatter brain"". He goes from one subject to another before fully developing the first. How this guy became ""famous"" is beyond me."
3,Almost a Great Shoe,"This is an absolutely gorgeous shoe, made with better quality than most shoes that cost twice if not three times as much. The sandal looks like a high heel, but feels like a flat.It's dainty on the foot, it's completely cushioned, the sole is moulded with support features so that it won't fly off your foot. It's a very dressy shoe, but comfortable as a casual shoe. I am in love.The problem? It's not true to size. I wear a 10M and it was too small on my foot. I sent them back for an 11M and that almost fit, but was still too tight on the toe.This is a shame. The quality of this shoe makes it worth twice what they're charging for it, but you're going to need to buy at least one size up."
4,Funny Funky Flick,"Marlon Wayans gets forced into the role of ""the stupid slapstick guy"" thankfully he doesn't play that part in this very underatted classic. This movie had me laughing and feeling great! With a hillarious performance by Matthew Lillard and a great evil characted portrayal from David Spade you have to check this one out... Cheap and above all fun!"
1,How could Spade do this???!!!!!,Most David Spade films are great but I just don't get why he would do this film. I do not at all agree with the other reviewers. This story has a thousand year old horrible plot and a whole bunch of horrible punch lines. Good acting though.
3,satisfactory condition inded,Plays fine... semi -diminished sound quality... and it cant stay in the case so I've had to find other means of containing the DVD..
5,Hilariously funny,"This movie is great - and I didn't catch any holes in it. Of course, you catch holes in everything after you've seen it upwards of 50 times, and I've only seen this movie five times, but still, no prominantly noticable holes :-)"
3,"1st part: great, really funny. 2nd part: so-so.","Well, well, well, in the beginning it was cool comedy. No, not just cool but REALLY COOL comedy about black guy who took part in some experiment which upgraded his senses. Kind of super-power. A lot of funny (REALLY FUNNY) situations, dumb, but great jokes etc. etc. Cool movie. I hadn't laughed in such a way for a long time.But then... Oops! The movie became less funny, some kind of soap appeared there, the authors seemed to remember about correctness and that's why the ending wasn't as cool and funny as beginning.I'm so sorry. But only 3 stars."
4,Throwback,"This movie came out in the late 90s when Marlon was in his prime. This is one of his better films, you know what to expect from the Wayans, laugh out loud comedy. You seen the show The Wayans Bros.(WHICH SHOULD OF NEVER GOT CANCELED!!! I WAS SO HEATED) but i digress lol, this movie is great, original material, the movie has a good concept, Marlon is spectacular. Buy this along with The Sixth Man, that movie is good money too."
5,A REAL JAZZ VOCAL ALBUM,"Combine the vocal talents of Mark Murphy with the brilliant arrangements of Ernie Wilkins, and you have an album that swings from top to bottom. It's a pure delight to listen to this."
2,"good item, very poorly packed",Plano 53 Aluminum Rifle Case arrived at my home packed only in it's flimsy display box not packed in a suitable shipping box as a reputable dealer would. Due to not packing the item properly resulted in two large dents in the case. The case itself works well and is of decent quality. I would not recommend purchasing anything from this particular supplier due to their inability to properly pack and ship an item. However I would recommend the case itself. It works well and looks good (except for the dents)!
3,Great case...but dented,"I received my shipment on time but as others have reported in their reviews, the case arrived with two dents on the front in between two of the latches. Other than the dents, it's a really nice case and should do an excellent job protecting my rifle. I would have returned the case for a new one to be sent but I need a case now and I don't want to go through the hassle of doing a return. If I did a return, then I would be without a case for probably another week or two, plus with the similar problems being reported by others, I am guessing the replacement case would have dents in it too. Knowing my luck, I would get the replacement case and it would have bigger dents than the one I have now so I guess I'll just stick with what I have. I really think Plano should have better quality control. After all, this case isn't cheap."
2,buyer beware,"i ordered one of these cases for my ar 15 because it looked long at sturdy in the picture. the first case arrived in the cheap manufacturer carboard box very scuffed up. the case itself had 2 large dents on top and on the bottom and i dont know if its from warehouse or UPS. sent it back and ordered a replacement and at first it seemed fine but the new one was also in crap packaging and had dents on the aluminum. looks good in picture but the aluminum feels like the stuff storm drains or porches are made out of. wouldnt recommend, at least the amazon prime version."
5,Excellent Gun Case,I recently purchased a 300 Ultra Mag. Because of the rifle length I needed a new protective and strong case. This gun case is perfect for the job.
5,Pleasantly Surprized!,I came across this clock quite by accident and I am so glad that I ordered it. It is very well made and that cranberry color looks much more stylish than the fire engine red that another brand offers in the same style. I couldn't be happier!!
4,Gary puts his heart into it again.,"As an avid fan of Gary Wright and his music from day 1, I relish anything new from this artist. Unlike some of his earlier stuff which appealed to the synth-pop fringe, Human Love follows a tact of bringing an amalgam of natural and synthetic timbres also mixed in with differing musical styles. The polish is a bright upbeat mix with something for most everyone's taste. There are two songs from the early '70's here which have been redone in contemporary fashion. Although none of the songs stand out as much as Dream Weaver still does, it is worth the investment if you like to listen to mellower pop with ethnic flavors. This album is a part of a new venture by Wright called Larkio music. I look forward to more."
1,my favorite show,"This is my favorite show, and it is a great cartoon. They really push the envelope and ""go there"", like sometimes her underwear falls off. lol....! #'_'# I didn't expect that...!I like how the fat black girl is sassy, ha ha. the black chef is also big and muscley and he looks like a prison rapper. But the light haired and light skinned charactars are all unattractive so it's not raceist. good show A+"
4,Better than most things on TV,"I started watching this when I went home for the holidays. My younger brother would watch it, so I really had no choice. Suprise, Suprise, it turned out to be pretty decent. The stereotypes of the characters combine nicely with the spoofing of reality shows in order to give you a good laugh at reality's expense.A little to mature for really young children, I'd say keep it for the 10+ crowd. And by plus, I mean waaaaaaaaaay plus. I'm in my twenty's and still get a kick out of it.All around, it's one of the best things CN has offered us lately"
2,"Good idea, but uncomfortable","The posture corrector actually does a lot for your posture, but it is so uncomfortable that I really don't wear it. If you are willing to wear it over clothes, it may work, but it can really irritate the skin when worn direclty over it."
1,Really didn't like it,"I think the author has good intentions and the book is readable, I just don't believe this kind of European new age stuff. It's pretty out there."
4,nice easy to use,"I bought it for myself its nice easy to use, I have made two things in it, and just wish the sides were 3/8"" to 1/2"" higher.other than that it is a good pan."
2,poor stacking,"If you really need small ice cube trays these will be fine. I bought 4 (2 sets) and found that they really didn't stack well when there were 4 of them. The design of the little tab that lets them stack is pretty poor -- if the tray is curved slightly then the tray won't stack right and the cubes below will be touching the plastic above and the whole stack will be lopsided. 2 of the trays I bought were curved so much that they wouldn't stack properly at all (even when full). The seller offered to replace them if I returned them, but for $3 what's the point of spending $5 to get new ones? I think I'll buy some bar supply trays instead. On the plus side, the cubes pop out really nicely."
5,nice size,"Good size for large mouth water bottle, ie, a KOR Delta BPA Free Hydration Vessel. Our regular size cubes were a little too big.Ordering another pack of these."
4,Great little trays,"Pros:Great trays make the perfect size ice cubes, without the problems you get with silicone traysCons:The trays tend to warp and become difficult to stack"
1,they warp.,useless. They warp. I suggest getting stainless steel or something harder than this. They warp and the water ends up spilling.
5,This is the original mix,"From before John got his hands on it. The 1996 remaster has a number of subtle changes (not subtle is the excellent extended instrumental part at the end of ""Trick of the Light"") anyone familiar with the original will surely notice."
4,Last Bash for Original Who,"A flawed album...but some good music. Townshend was banging his head against the wall for material while Keith Moon was out of control. Pete struggled to keep Moonie up to speed during the recording sessions which did not go smoothly.Still, a must have for who fans."
3,Not as shown in picture,"Just received this pad from Amazon and it is not as shown in the picture. Even though the description states 8 holes, the picture shows a 5-hole pad, which also has 3 screw holes. I thought maybe they were counting the screw holes as part of the 8, but no, the actual pad has 8 air holes AND the 3 screw holes. Would give it more stars if they fixed the picture, I really like Milwaukee tools generally."
2,mmm.....the legacy?,"I ve purchased this CD around last month at a local store..I am a long time fan of the keepers 1 & 2 albums. I immediately when home and played the CD with much expectation that its going to sound great! then there goes the the king of 1000 years song etc etc. after I ve finished listening to the 1st CD, I find this album is quit bored with the song mostly sound alike what I mean is Andi always sang the chorus the same style..anyway the solos and the riffs are still great thats why they still deserved 2 stars...."
2,Don't be fooled by the packaging...,"This new album by Helloween comes with a gorgeous packaging, featuring two CD's, full lyrics, great cover and booklet art. But the music (that's what matters, by the way) is incredible poor, making this another lackluster album in Helloween's discograhpy.Don't get me wrong, I like the band a lot, but let's face it: with Andi Deris they began to sunk ever more, and their last albums were not great. This new ""Keeper"" is another disappointment."
3,"Helloween misses the mark with ""The Legacy""","First off, to all those who wished Kiske and Hansen should've been on this:GET A LIFE!! they have moved on and so should you!Andi Deris wrote the most ""Keeper"" sounding songs on this release. I am not a huge fan of Deris' voice but it's his songs that reminded me of the original ""Keeper"" albums except the modern sounding ""Come Alive"" and the weird duet w/Candace Night(Blackmore's Night) on ""Light The Universe"" And Michael Weikath only contributed 1 ""Keeper"" sounding song and that's ""Get It Up"" the other songs (especially the Sascha Gerstner songs) have NOTHING to remind you that you are listening to a ""Keeper"" album.""Keeper"" sounding tracks:Mrs. God (Somewhat)Silent RainOccasion AvenueGet It UpHowever, in closing, if you liked ""Better Than Raw"" and ""The Dark Ride"" then the rest of this album is for you as it exemplifies that era. and to me that's not a bad thing but it's not a ""Keeper"" either"
4,Helloween/ Keeper of the seven keys,"Having listened to this band since they came on the scene, I have to say this is their best work to date. Excellent progression from album to album. A Real good Starting point for anyone that is just finding out about this talented group."
2,Another disappointment from Helloween,"This album does not even compare to ""Keeper"" parts 1, 2. It's just a bitter disappointment. Maybe the band should have at least ""borrowed"" some ideas from their metal peers ( Kreator comes to mind ) before they actually recorded this latest album."
4,Legacy worth it,"It took me about 2 weeks to get used to this album. The more I listen to it however, the more I discover just how musically diverse it truely is. Legacy is it's own album and sounds nothing like past works. I am blown away by the creativeness of this band everythime they release an album. I have been a loyal Helloween fan 14 years now and I know the good from the bad. This one is worth your time."
5,should have been the follow up to the 1st,"if your just joining the helloween band wagon welcome aboard. this is a great cd worth every dollar.this is what musicians sound like,great writting lyrcs and music.eurometal lives on.some of my fav songs the invisable man,mrs.god,occasion ave,and to be political do you know what your fighting for,in all honesty this is a cd you can play with out the skip button.some of there earlyer stuff to check out,the 1st keeper of the 7 keys,walls of jerico(a must have), dark ride is ok, better than raw,and the one with the rabbit coming out of the hat you will not be disapionted"
5,The best first guide to identifying firsts,"This little booklet is a point-by-point description of famous first editions. For a general description of first edition clues from thousands of publishers, see A Pocket Guide to Identification of First Editions, also by McBride."
1,very dry boring and dry again,i ordered this cd after hearing let it be me on the radio a song off the cd well i was extremely disappointed it did not hold my attention and i was not moved at all they should have just done a single because the rest of the cd is quite a bomber i hate to put down a gospel cd but i must tell the truth
3,Healed Without Scars,"Never heard of the group before I ordered the cd, heard one song on the radio. The cd is ok, but if I had the choice to re-order I wouldn't."
2,Head/Mic Set Review,"Comfortable, and good price, but for some reason the acoustics are off. I play videogames primarily with it, and the footsteps in the game are not accurate to which direction they are coming from. My other headphones I used to use did not have this problem, and it only started with these new headphones. Also, people I'm playing with have often said it is really quiet, even though the mic volume is turned all the way up. Its an okay product, but the couple of drawbacks I have had, are pretty inconvenient. But you get what you pay for.."
4,As advertised.,"the labtech headset with microphone is pretty good for the price. it's actual functionality is a bit sensitive because if you move a lot, it will cause the other party to hear sounds. i've had to move positions a couple times to get the other person to hear. not perfect, but it does what it's suppose to do."
4,nice headphones!,"very nice headphones considering the price. clear sound & the mic delivers great sound as well. i haven't had them for too long so, can't really talk about endurance but, they look quite hardy."
4,Decent headphones. Price was high.,"I bought these from Amazon and found out later that I could have gotten them cheaper at Circuit City. They are decent quality, the only drawback is the microphone is very sensitive."
2,Not really a good product.,"The product spoilt within 2 weeks of purchase. The head set still works but the mic does not. If am talking with someone with it, I would hear the person but the person will not hear me."
3,Doesn't last long,"The headset was good for the months it actually worked. But the microphone on it stopped working after a couple of months. It was quite comfortable on the ears, though, so it's a pity it broke so soon. But I guess for the price you cannot really expect a lot."
2,Poor headphone plug connection,"These were great at first, but in just a few months I had more and more trouble with the headphone plug connector. It now only works if I push the plug to one side while using it. I've confirmed that the problem does not occur with other headphones.It's a shame that this otherwise great product is now useless to me. I am generally very careful with how I treat my electronics, but a headphone plug needs to be able to handle a little wear and tear. I'm going to be more economical this time and try the TekNmotion headset for half the price."
4,Great for me.,"I have a tendency to purchase the top of the line, especially when it comes to electronics or products such as this. This time I decided to go the budget route and wasn't disappointed. I just recently signed up with Skype and needed headphones with a mic. These functioned great and I'm completely satisfied. Crystal clear reception and flawless integration. The only improvement could be a folding mechanism. I'll be traveling with these and am eager to see how they hold up long term."
4,Good headset for the price,"Works well. I purchase this because the one that came with Dragon Speaking Naturally software was hard to adjust and very uncomfortable. This set is easy to adjust, comfortable, and the mike and earphones work well."
4,Great product for Skype,"I talk to my family through Skype every week. I used to hear my voice from their speaker sent to their microphone back to me. I realized that they heard their voice if I turned the speaker louder. After I use this headset, I often hear the comment that my voice is very clear when we have family conference call."
1,"This headset is perfect, if you don't mind the person on the other line not being able to hear you...","This headset is perfect, if you don't mind the person on the other line not being able to hear you...I purchased this headset because the price was reasonable,unfortunately, the microphone is crap as it goes in and out"
4,A good headset.,"As some others have stated, the plastic is kind of cheap - and therefore is susceptible to breaking if you abuse it much. As a bit of an audiophile, I was pleased with the sound. I give the sound quality a 4 out of 5 for this price range - it's quite good for $12. The microphone also sounds quite good for this price. I come in crisp and clear to my Ventrilo friends - some of which use much more expensive mics."
1,Do not buy this item,"Do not buy this item. I plugged the head phones in and my computer the headset worked, but the microphone did not. One thing I can say is the labtech tech was kind and willing to work with me in letting me know the product was faulty. Save yourself some time and frustration and do not buy this product."
1,bad mic,"the sound quality is really good, however the mic is very bad. I used it on skype, the other party can barely hear me. When I change to my old mic, it works fine, proving not the problem with the party on the other end."
4,Cheap headset with microphone,"The headset has quality sound for a very low price. The microphone also works well with minimal echo. The headset is not the most comfortable, but serviceable, with slight adjustments of length possible. For less than $15, you can't go wrong."
3,Nice Sound,The head set fits comfortably over your head and soft to the ears. It would have been even nicer with a sound level switch. Sound is nice as well.
1,Read the details - plug make sure it's right for you,I bought this very quickly to use for skype on my lap top. I clearly didn't read the details. Don't make the same mistake. I assumed incorrectly it had a ubs(?) plug it doesn't. It has an old fashion long round plug - like I had on my very first computer tower. I hoped that maybe there was an adapter included but no. Mea Culpa.
2,Labtech Stereo headset with microphone,"Okay, I think I left a review on this item before but after about 6 months of using it the sound doesn't work well at all, the mic on it works but what is a microphone on a headset with no incoming sound? So basically I would recommend looking into another headset and review the quality of it as well."
4,Medium grade Headphone and Mic,"Decent sound for both headphones and mic- I use these infrequently, and would suggest a higher quality, lessor wieght set for frequent users."
3,Just Okay...,"Sound quality is good enough, but not studio quality. The headphones are comfortable enough, at least for an hour or two of continuous usage. The weight is so light, which is very good.I don't enjoy that it has no volume control of its own, so volume has to be adjusted at the device producting (or receiving) the sound. It also doesn't look durable enough but time will tell."
4,Awesome product with fantastic sound quality,using this product for quite a bit now. fantastic sound quality even with youtube not so good audio output it gives wonderful performance..must buy if one is looking for cheap and awesome product.
2,BOOO!!,"So I got these on august 14th and on september the 2nd the earphones stopped working,so I had a mic but no sound.So I think you should either have a back-up pair or Buy a higher performance which is probably higher costing Set.do not purchase the warranty for these it doesn't kick in until after the manufacture warranty expires(1 year) it is like pulling teeth to get the warranty enforced.amazon really should stop selling these disposable pieces of junk.filling the land fills"
2,Too much interference,"Before purchasing this microphone I thought all microphones are the same. In fact, they're not. This one is causing lots of interference when I tried to use it with my computer especially when the speaker of the monitor is switched one. Besides, microphone boost is a must if you want other people to hear you clearly especially if you're using skype to call a landline. I never had to do this with my other microphones. Very disappointed. Think twice before placing your order."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad Product","Though it's stylish and comfortable, that's all it is.I tried it on and my voice came out fuzzy so I removed the foam piece from the mic set. Made the recording better. But made it echo. So when I used a program like Ventrilo, the other users complained.The only thing this is good for is it's sound quality, which is good. But the microphone is awful!"
2,Very disappointed,"I've bought Labtec equipment before and I've always been satisfied. Not so with this headset. It's comfortable and appears to be durable, but it's the sound that matters, and it's terrible! Everyone I called said it sounds muffled. I had someone call me with it on, and it does sound quite muffled. I'm very disappointed, so back it went."
5,This is what all movies should be like..,"Just a very well written, acted, and shot movie. It makes you cringe, think, and draws you in as few movies do. Not to sound cliche, but this movie has all the qualities you'd hope for each time you sit down in front of the big screen.Edward Norton is clearly one of the best actors going and this is just another rock solid performance."
5,"Excelent movie, with amazing acting, and great story.","I always enjoy Edward Norton movies, and I think he is one of the best actors of today. This movie proves it. He basically plays two different characters, because it is one person at two very different times in his life. Each one he portrays brilliantly. At times of his past life he scares and shocks you, while when he is older you feel compasion for him. This movie was also a eye opening look into racism and ganglife in America, and had an excelent story with a suprising ending. It is definitley one of my favorites, and if you haven't had a chance to see it, go now!"
5,Great Story If You Don't Mind Some Graphic Content,"American History X blew me away the first time I watched it. The story is both political and personal, and forces you to think about the world around you in a different way.But, if you have any problems with violence or language this is not the movie for you. I wouldn't call it excessive, because that would be saying that there's more than there should be, and that's not the case. In order for this story to be told well the graphic content is necessary.Don't let the violence or language push you away from this unless that is something that completely ruins a movie for you. This really is an awesome movie."
5,Good Movie,This is a great series and makes the perfect gift. The product is of great quality and presentation. Glad I ordered.
5,Gut-wrenching thriller,"An extremely powerful film, at times I found myself struggling to keep my eyes on the screen during several highly visceral scenes. As usual Edward Norton blows the top off of his role and is at times admirable, despicable, remorseful, calculating, and vicious. A must see"
4,American History X,"I love this movie. My only criticism is the excessive language. If It wasn't for that, this movie could be used by parents and educators to teach a new generation about racism and how one influential man was able to make a complete turn around. The main character (Derek) learned how to see past the color of someone's skin and came home to help his family discover the same. The movie has a very sad ending, but unfortunately an all to common reality."
5,outstanding video 88/14!,the movie is a must see. the only problem was the look of danny. he looked sloppy when in fact skinheads dress very neat. that goes for all types. still very acurate none the less.88!
4,"I'm the screenwriter, so I might be biased","This is a film that I'm very proud of as a whole. Being the writer of the project, I know what was left in, what we couldn't use, who hated each other, who worked together. But stopping for a moment and really looking back, this film could've been off the charts. If you take strong notice, you will see that many of the scenes Edward is not in are poorly directed. This falls simply on the heels of Tony. With crisp and poignant direction, say from a master of the form like Stone or Scorsese, we could've truly touched magic. As the screenwriter, thank you for all the wonderful comments and I'm glad I've been a part of touching so many people. My mother-in-law clued me onto this and I have to say that it really made my day. Thank you."
5,The Best Movie I have Ever Seen,"I really loved this movie because it shows people how life is out there in the real world. There are times that people like to watch movies with a happy ending but life is not like that. Someone is always getting hurt in life. This movie also tells how it is in prison and how people have control in there. For anyone reading this review, I advise you to see this movie. I don't think that I will ever see a real-life movie as good as this one."
5,The five stars are only for Edward Norton's performance,"This movie gained its credibility only because of Edward Norton's outstanding performance.Social commentary? Revelation of rampant racism? On the contrary, this movie is an exploitation of a very serious issue confronting America. Hate does not need to be commercialized and thrown in the faces of the sheep-like youth of the USA. This movie will spawn copy-catting."
5,"Gripping, powerfully graphic with extraordinary performances","wow. simply wow. i walked out of the theater holding my breath, thinking to myself for the rest of the day. film is a powerful medium, and if there is one movie to prove it its this one. from the best performance i have seen in my life (ed norton) to the best told storyline it was just a totally amazing movie. very graphic, profane, and shocking, but NOTHING in the movie is unnecessary, it is all there to weave into the plot and give the effect it does. A+++pabl0b@aol.com"
2,Not realistic,"A very corny film that doesn't develop any of the portrayed characters except Norton's role. Cheesy slo-mo sequences like Bevery D'Angelo's scene where she kneels down in front of her house looked so amateurish. And the sports metaphor of the film! White skinheads beating black homeboys at...get this.... basketball? And the ""super intellectual"" high school teacher, reportedly possessing two PhD degrees, using a double-negative in one grammatically disappointing scene. This film could've said and done so much more than it did. The murder scene on the street curb was totally unnecessary - leaving it out would not have detracted from the film's ""message"".....so why? Second rate entertainment at best."

2,"""It will Change your life!""......I think not!","Dont belve what you hear about this movie see it for your self rent it first. I think it was realy disgriminating twards whites and blacks and I dont think it cleared any thing up in twards the racest tendencys of our country in fact it probibly furterd them. And the story that a guy sent in to prison with Natzi tattos all over his body,for less than a year had his life canged by one black man who he did the landery with. Its rediculess.The reason I give this Movie 2 stars is that it has good cinimatography and soud and you might like it but see it for your self first."
4,Amazing Story,"This is an excellent movie - not because of the hate, racism, and prejudice, but because of the exact opposite. With a stellar performance from Edward Norton, we get to see a positive change in learned human nature through a trying personal experience. After killing two black men, Derek Vinyard goes to prison for manslaughter as a bigot and a man with hatred towards anybody but the white population. Through his experience and interaction with a certain black man in prison, he quickly realizes that he is the minority there, and he is released from prison as a new man. This movie will give you goosebumps to see the transformation of Derek Vinyard and how it impacts his brother Danny, how they learn to accept others, and let go of the hate and anger in their hearts. It is difficult to face that people treat others this way in real life. Through this movie, it is interesting to see the different points of view regarding this issue. Highly recommended."
4,"Disturbing, but Important","I saw this movie, and well, it disturbed me. Some scenes were incredibly graphic. I wanted to shield my eyes like a five year old watching a kissing scene in a movie. However, this movie is wonderful in many other ways. It has the whole This Is What Racism Is And It's Bad theme, Edward Norton does a wonderful job portraying a man who has killed because he was a racist and then fighting with the demons of the killing, and the filming technique is brilliant. I can't explain it all, so I will leave you to see this movie on your own. This is one of those movies that everyone should see, but not one that everyone will like. It's more of a movie to be respected."
4,Excellent Movie,"I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone 16 and up...as a matter of fact, it is a ""need-to-see"" for ages 16 and up. The ending of the movie climaxes idiotic and pompous racial violence that exists in American cities today, and worldwide. This movie provides the viewer with a look into a highly racist situation in California, but the location doesn't matter. The themes of the movie play out for any and all racial violence that has ever occured. I take away one star due to the heavy language, heavy violence, and sexual/racist themes that only an higher-aged teen could relate with or understand."
5,completly awseome,"The movie was one of the best Neo-nazi films I have ever seen and thought Norton gave a stunning performance, one of his best. The film delivered a strong message."
1,Basicly review of this movie's plot.,"-In the view of a white person towards the black: Black guys are good.-In the view of a black person towards the white: White guys are bad.-Black is right, no change needed,-White is wrong, change needed.And the story ends with the white guy hopping over to join the blacks.If this story hadn't been focusing on so much PR, it might have been very good."
3,"If you haven't seen the movie, Don't Read My Review!","American History X is a really good movie, but there is one thing that is terribly wrong with it. If you have'nt seen the movie, don't read the next line. If a character in a movie is also the narrator, that person cannot die in the movie. In this movie, the narrator does die. Therefore, this movie isn't the best. It goes against the rules of storywriting and film making. The movie is good and very well done, but the mistake they made ruins it."
1,Propaganda for Illiterates,"Wow. The number of glowing reviews for this repellent little work of art shows what a fine job our public schools are doing at turning people into mind-numbed, politically correct morons. American History X juxtaposes the perfectly rational dialogue by the film's main ""racist"" (Norton's character) with appalling acts of violence, in an attempt to link reasonable and legitimate conservative opinions with outright racism. (I can just imagine what the geniuses who admire this film will say after reading this review... ""Reasonable???"") The filmmaker is trying to say that holding opinions expressed by certain characters such as opposition to affirmative action/ welfare is just a few steps away from stomping on someone's head. That is the totalitarian tendency of political correctness. American History X wallows in the most pretentious political correctness ever put on film."
4,A controversial classic...,"I love the film. It addresses many of today's race problems and tells that if we don't get along, it will only get worse. Edward Norton's acting ability in this film is the main reason why he is one of my favorite actors today."
4,powerful gutsy drama,"american history x is a raw unrelenting powerhouse of a film. the cats is excellent and thouroughly believalbe. the constant profanity is a tru e reflection of the speech and senseibilities of the charaters. As stated earlier, the film shows racism and destructive violence on the part of both blacks and whites. The segment where derek abandons his racist views in prison is not made as clear as it should have been, but the raw power and emotion of the film make it a great viewing experience,"
5,Powerful and Shocking,"This is the one movie I feel strong enough to write a review for. I saw this movie in the theatre when it was first released. It was then, and remains to be, the only movie that I have left where there was deathly silence as people exited, and where you could see tears in the eyes of men and women.The acting is powerful, the story line excellent and the message undeniable... Watch this movie."
3,American History X,"I heard some good things about this movie that built my expectations, that were left unmet. The story to me was largely unbelievable. The acting by many was weak including Edward Norton. There are much better movies about the dangers of racism and extremism."
5,Incredible,"This film has more to say, contains more truth about the human condition and our ability to hate each other and ourselves, than everything else that has come out of Hollywood in the past twenty years.Coming from a fiercely jaded person growing up in the eMpTyV generation, desensitized to most everything the world can throw at me, this movie made me cry."
3,Edward Norton's performance shines. Everything else was sub-standard.,"Bad script. Stupid plot. But I liked almost everything else about the film. And Edward Norton's performance was great. He is a fine actor who has a natural mastery of difficult roles and made me feel that he actually WAS the skinhead he portrayed. American History X is set in Venice Beach, California, a hotbed of racial tension and it's time that someone finally was willing to deal with this problem in a film.Ed Norton plays the role of a skinhead who has a change of attitude while in prison and then tries to keep his younger brother from following in his footsteps. There's lots of brutality and violence. And lots of excellent directing. Flashbacks are in black and white. There are good uses of slow motion and cuts. But not every performance was as stellar as Norton's, and there was way too much psycho-babble instead of some thought-provoking scenes.Recommended for the curious, but it is certainly not a great film."
5,An amazing movie!,I highly recommend this movie to everyone! Great acting and a great story. I hope everyone else can enjoy the movie as much as I did.
5,Great Great movie,"You will want to go change the world after watching this movie. Edward Norton's best role ever. This is a great movie with great characters, great acting but an ever better story. This is exactly what we needed to bring racism to the forefront and tell the story about how people can change. Everyone should watch this movie."
1,It's a movie that should have been made into a book.,Not knocking this movie but I would have rather read this in a book. It was a little to rasict for me.
5,impact will stay with you for weeks,"Awesome, powerful movie about hate and how it can rip apart a society. Norton gives an jaw dropping performance about a Neo Nazi that changes his hating ways after a prison education. But, tragically it is too late for his brother. Great movie about redemption and how hate and lack of understanding will continue to divide our country."
5,Great Film.,I will add to this later. I am in the middle of re-editing my review and will post it soon. Thank you. Enjoy the flick.
5,Most Powerful written movie since Schindler's List,"I simply loved this movie. I watch tons of videos every week. I haven't been so moved by a movie in a long time. This truely shows what might happen to somebody in that postion. I come from a racist family and I know that it is a taught behavior. Although many people in my family can not accept how I am, I live the way I do because I don't believe that it is right to hate a person because of the color of their skin. There were parts of this movie that drove me to tears and i rejoiced at the changes that Derek made in his life. Aerican History X was so powerful and breathtaking that I have recommened it to as many people as I can. I will own this movie when I can get a copy if it. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong are great actors and they work well with each other. A five star movie through and through!!!!!!"
5,GREAT film,This is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. Norton gave an amazing performance (he should have won the OSCAR). This film should be required viewing in all high schools. It shows the true horrors of racism and just how ugly hatered makes us.
5,ROBERTO WHO,After seeing this movie I could not believe Ed Norton did not win the Oscar...This was one of the best performances I have seen since Bob's Taxi Driver...I could not believe how intense the movie was and I must say it was all acting. Norton was brilliant. The racial rehtorics were almost a backdrop of a story about a family getting through a crisis....Must See
5,"A great movie, sad, some disturbing violent scences.","This was a great movie which shows the consequences of racism and hate. There are some violently disturbing scenes and it probably was on the verge of an NC-17 rating because it had some sex at the beginning, a lot of profanity, very violent scenes, a lot of hate and racial topics (of course-), full-male frontal nudity, and a prison rape. If you can stand all that, its a great movie and I recommend it."
5,What a rush!,This movie weasels it's way into my mental top 10 list of all-time great movies. It's such an emotional roller coaster ride from start to end. Ed Norton puts forth his best acting effort yet. The whole cast was picked perfectly. This movie is a must see!!!!
5,The best movie I have ever seen!,"American History-X dives head first into the racial problems of America. The best thing about this movie is that it shows racism from the standpoint of white against black and black against white. Although this is a sad problem in this country, it is 100% correct. A wonderful film that everybody should see!"
3,I was not impressed by the story,"I watched the film expecting something powerful and thought provoking but with the exception of some very hard scenes indeed, the story was predictable. It's true that Edward Norton gives a superb performance as a skinhead Nazi admirer and there are some arguments pro and against racism in the US, but the film didn't impress me. I found it too much 2-dimensional, with no adequate depth. I'm afraid that very soon we will see a ""European History X"" version, if the confrontation of civilizations continue on its current path."
5,Hatered Leaves Us Dying,This movie was a great movie. My dad and I watched it together and my dad was shocked on how realistic this movie was. It showed how hatered destory's and seperates families. It is also interesting that it doesn't condem the characters but shows how they change from hate filled people to loving people. It was only that it was to late.This movie is the best movie to use to teach kids about hatered and how it destroys instead of constructing.
3,Powerfully Moving,After seeing this film I was amazed I had never heard anyone speak of it. This film is powerfully moving watching one mans struggle to save his brother from the fate he is inflicted on him himself.Norton is amazing in this film and earned a well deserved Oscar nomination as he is so believeable as Derek Vinyard. To watch the final scene where Derek realises it is to late to save brother Danny brought tears to my eyes.The film in general is amazing how the past is portrayed in black and white and the present in colour.The scenes when Derek is retelling his time in prison are very touching and to watch a man realise all he has known is a lie is very moving indeed.I love this film and now after watching it tell everyone I know what a great film it actually is.
5,One of the most powerful films of our time,"In a word, this film is fabulous.It is an emotionally engaging, heartrending experience, essentially unlike anything I have ever seen before.It is a shame that this movie remains relatively unknown--it is certainly comparable to some of the greatest ""classic"" films that people tout much more openly: the stark, unflinching way in which it addresses some of the darkest elements not only of our society, but of the individual, is unforgettable.This is THE film for anyone who is looking for a thought-provoking, stirring, and unbelievably raw work.Norton (who, incidentally, ended up contributing a great deal in the post-production process after the director effectively abandoned the project) delivers a fabulous and haunting performance.NOTE: This film is not for everyone. Approach with an open mind, or stay away."
5,American History X is excellent,"American History X is an excellent, powerful film. Norton's performance is oscar worthy, in my opinion. It is not for the squeamish, however."
4,good,"Oo my goodness, the movie american history x was sooooo good! That movie was deep!but it's a good story and I am hearing take to Review its I like it!"
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time! Great value for money, and it looks incredible on Blu Ray!"
4,One of Eddie Furlong's best...,"(...)Anyway, this movie explores racism, racial differences, hypocrisy and political extremism in a perceptive and entertaining manner. The neo-nazi lead isn't pure evil, but is instead human, with the capacity to think. His minority victims are not pure innocence, either. A complicated story.So many films that cover the prickly topic of racism adopt a simple and misleading ""politically correct"" attitude, wherein the minority acts like saints, and the majority acts like villains. I prefer films where everybody acts like humans with all their foibles and faults and, yes, virtues.Yes, racism is BAD and tolerance is GOOD.But, to make a movie that is a simple morality play insults the viewer's intelligence. You have to keep it real.""American History X"" keeps it real."
5,intense and emotional,A must see movie for all races. Should be required viewing for high school students.
1,"great movie, horrible quality!","the first and last hd movie I rent from amazon. the movie itself is great, but the quality was awful. the entire movie sounded like an old dragging cassette tape. for $5 I expected better, or my money back!"
2,Am i the only one who saw thru this garbage?,"Ok, i admit, i was totally blown away by the shock factor of the first half of this movie. Gutsy, Gutsy, Gutsy. But after that, it totally falls apart. It goes from the shocking, disturbing truth to the ultimate hollywood cliche: ""Guy realises he's done wrong with his life and wants to make everything right."" This movie turned cheeseball in a matter of seconds. Pointless scenes litter the last half of the movie. The writers cheap attempt at trying to explain Edward Nortons character's hatred was a joke and totally unnecessary. Couple that with the predictable ending and you have a typical sub-par hollywood movie. It's really too bad too, cuz the first hour is amazing. One thing is for sure though, Edward Norton is one of todays best young actors."
5,"Racism, and hate all in one fandamntastic movie.","Everyone told me that i would love this movie, and after giving in and watching it, i almost kicked myself in the head for not watching it sooner. I wouldnt classify myself as racist, because everyone is equal, but what Derek ( Edward Norton) said in that movie, well to be honest some of it made so much sense. This movie is about skinheads, and the major skin head who brutally kills two black men for trying to ""jack"" his car. What this man goes through is enough to make anyone loose their marbles, especially the ending. Just when you think that everything is going to be ok, you want to cry. Great movie, i recommend you give it to all the rebellious teenagers out there who just don't care anymore."
3,Interesting,"I like this movie, but just for the acting. The whole Nazi theme was a turn off for me. Edward Norton does a great job acting though. I'd say it's his second best compared to Fight Club."
5,Lovely movie that sets its eyes on issues we continue to fail to address.,"A very eyeopening, intense drama that will have you questioning America's pursuit to quelling conflicts between racial ethnicity in this country. This film gets an A+ for reminding us where our country's been and where our country has become from its shaky history with race. Although, I have to warn, this film may offend those who are quite sensitive to the issue so if you are one of those people I suggest you watch something else... perhaps a Disney movie or something of that nature."
5,AN IN YOUR FACE WAKEUP CALL!,"THE PERFORMANCES ARE BRUTALLY HONEST. THE STORY AND CHARACTERS ARE REAL.THIS MOVIE IS AS REAL AS YOU CAN GET,AS FAR AS GETTING INSIDE THE MINDS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS.THE VIOLENCE AND PROFANITY ADD TO THE REALITY OF THESE GROUPS THAT ARE OUT THERE.THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE PART OF SOCIOLOGY CLASSES IN ALL SCHOOLS.THE FLASHBACKS OF HOW AND WHY HE TURNED DOWN THE PATH OF HATRED ADD TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THIS FILM.I OFTEN WONDER WHO RESEARCHED THE MATERIAL FOR THIS FILM,BECAUSE THE MOVIE IS SO REAL,THAT YOU CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF IT WAS BASED ON SOMEONES OWN REAL-LIFE EXPERIANCE.IN ANY CASE THIS IS A MOVIE THAT SHOULD BE WATCHED BY THE WHOLE FAMILY AND DISCUSSED AFTERWARD.SOMETIMES BRUTAL IN YOUR FACE HONESTY IS THE ONLY WAY ONE CAN UNDERSTAND AND REALIZE THAT ALL HATE GROUPS WILL EXIST ONLY IF WE LET THEM."
4,Edward Norton completes this movie,This movie is the reason Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors. This really puts you in the mindset of troubled youth and how easily they are munipulated. I enjoyed every aspect of this movie except for the acting of Edward Furlong. He was the same kid from the T2 movie and has no depth to his acting ability.
2,It skips,"Despite being as ""Good as New"", the DVD skips in every player I put it in. I several-minute blocks of content, and it takes forever for the player to try to find the next readable data. It's a great movie, but I expected to get a disc that at least mostly worked."
5,Excellent film,"Watch this film for studies in culture, racism, and societal influences. This is a thought provoking film that I highly recommend. Edward Norton's acting in this film is superb. The supporting roles are also played very well."
5,Exquisite and Important,"My husband and I are both in our 50's and we both wept throughout this movie, and it is not superficially emotional...designed to make you cry. It is just so deeply impacting that it pierces something deep in your psyche and your spirit. I have not seen a more important motion picture in my life. Everyone of every racial and political persuasion should be required to view this film. This makes anything Spike Lee has ever done, look like idiocy. When a movie like this was out there to be made, a film that truly addresses the honest racial attitudes of real people, it makes one wonder wonder why a piece of filth like ""He's Got Game"" was even allowed to go into distribution. I hope Spike has seen this one."
5,Incredible,"I don't want to give away any of this movie because it is something you definately need to experience for yourself. Honestly I can say it was the most incredible movie I have seen maybe ever. Edward Norton is the best part of the movie as far as I am concerned. His character is totally believable and takes you along on his emotional and intellectual rollercoasters. All the other characters are wonderful and are definately able to keep your attention. If you like movies that look at social problems in a different way, keep you intrigued and let you think, this is definately a good way to spend two hours.-BH"
4,"Don't think, just feel...","Don't think too hard about this film, because if you do, you'll soon realize that the story is pretty much implausible. Instead, suspend your disbelief, and allow yourself to believe Ed Norton's finely crafted performance and be absolutely blown away."
4,"Excellent acting, but problems with overall continuity","This film was much better than I had expected. I guess I thought that this was going to be just another formulaic story about a white supremacist who somehow becomes enlightened. This film is scary, intense and intelligent. The acting was superior--the dining table scene was incredible. But there were some definite flaws. There's something wrong with the overall flow of the film. It feels like several scenes pieced together, rather than one conhesive piece. Still, it makes a compelling statement and I was completely engaged throughout."
4,This is not a feel good movie...,"It's tough, gritty, brutal and honest. Hatred is something people feel at least once in their lives...this film centers on how hatred has cast a shadow over a middle-class suburban family. Ed Norton plays a reformed white power advocate who is just getting out of prison and trying to right all the wrongs he's done in his life. Norton attemps to rescue his younger brother, who's played by Ed Furlong, from the clutches of a white power guru. Intense and eye-opening, this film is not for those who are easily offended by racial slurs and other subjects that tackle racism in all it's true light. Along the same lines as Romper Stomper, but not quite as overtly racist. The DVD is somewhat weak, and only contains a few features that don't add up to much. Big fans of the film may want to pass until another edition hits shelves, whenever that may be...but it's certainly worth a look for the curious"
3,A Little Too Fomulaic,The acting is effective so it must be the plot that somehow leaves you wondering if something a little less p.c. and more essential could have occurred. This film could have been done in the 50's or 60's. Time has passed and we have learned something from it though it feels like the truth of it was missed here. Didn't really grab me as I hoped it would.
3,Good but expected more,"After seeing the trailers for this film, and reading some of the reviews I was expecting great things. Unfortunately I was ultimately dissapointed. While undoubtably a good film it reminded me of those ""made for TV"" efforts in its style, plot development and ultimate conclusion, and at the end telling the viewer the moral message. That really sumed up my feeling on it. It was too blatent, and too obvious spelling things out rather than leaving the viewer to make up their own mind . Despite this it does have some merits, and Edward Norton is excellent in the main role."
4,Good Movie!!!!!,"I have seen this movie about 5 times and like it more and more whenever I watch it. I bought this movie as a gift for my girlfriend(nothing says I love you more than American History X =P)because she as well liked the movie so I figured it would be a good gift. Anyways, all I have to say is that it is a good movie focusing on a person who committed a hate crime and tells his tale from beginning to end. If you have not seen it, go either rent or buy it. You will not be disappointed."
2,Could've been great. Only OK,"When I heard that Ed Norton was going to play a skinhead I couldn't wait. To be fair he did great with what he was given, but unfortunately he wasn't given much.All of the characters, even Norton's, were two dimensional. They were there to serve the plot. It's fine to have a movie that says racism is bad, but a really great one would've made you agree and sympathize with the skinheads and racists before it showed you the violence and hate that come from those views.I might have liked it more if I didn't have such high hopes coming in. As it is I can't help but feel that the director/studio wasted a great opportunity with one of the best and most fearless young actors in movies.I knew that racism was bad going in and after it was over I hadn't learned anything new."
3,gives skins a bad name,"OK this is a good movie , it has a good story on rascial prejudice and how our own hatred only ignites violence after violence. But I was perturbed by the use of ""skinheads"" over and over again , and how they were all presented as shaved headed doc marten wearing nazi's. The characters in the films were neo-nazis , not skinheads. True skinheads are anti rascist working class people who believe in unity and family support. Skinheads were given a bad name by movies such as this who portrayed all of us skins as people who shave our heads and wear swastikas , and the media also ignited more violence from blacks on skins because they thought anyone who shaved their head and claimed to be a skin was a rascist. This film does the same. Constantly saying skinhead over and over. Now the film is great to watch in terms of it's message , but it still gives us skins a bad reputation."
1,I wonder...,"if we will ever have a movie exemplifying the racist attitudes of the people of Israel?The problem with this movie is it portrays ethnocentricism as a white pathology, which is completely contrary to what we find in this world. How many people like Norton's character really exist in our modern world? Very few. If we are going to make a movie about ethnocentric behavior, the portrayal of an Israeli soldier would be much more relavent and believable.Ultimately, this movie provides no insight to real life racist behavior. It simply promotes the hollywood myth that egalitarianism is the normal human tendency, and only white people prefer their own race or tribe over others. Meanwhile, the whole world is errupting in ethnic wars and indoctrinated Americans don't have a clue as to why."
2,how do you make neo-nazis appear trite?,"i was eagerly looking forward to catching up with this movie id missed at the time of its release, esp since im a fan of both edward norton and eddie furlong (even as just an acxtor, lol). however, this was an overwrought and overthought mess. there is nothing here that hasnt been covered (sans the dirty language) in a slew of tv movies dating back to the episode of ""twilight zone"" where dennis hopper met hitler. and a bald eddie furlong is not much fun to look at. norton is less and less interesting an actor as time goes along, but at least here he was still trying."
4,So Real,"This is a picture that makes you think. Ed Norton gives an outstanding performance as a racist skinhead. You can really see how someone can fall into the trap of blaming others and hating people that are differant just for being differant. The movie follows Norton in his journey from skinhead, to prisoner, then caring older brother trying to keep his younger brother from following the same path. It is dark movie, and there is no happy ending for this one, but it is wonderfully crafted and well acted all the way around."
5,Ignorance is the problem,"This movie was great. Everyone should see this movie for it will change his or her life. I don't think I need to analyze the movie for you or keep telling you how good it is. The movie was not about NAZIs so it did not go indepth into their ideals. The movie was not about solving the problems of illegal immigration or solving the problems of our prisons. The movie was more about how racism is rooted in ignorance and hate. It is about how families in America are being torn apart. It is about the ills of racism and hate. It is about how people CAN change when they realize that ignorance is NOT bliss. That is my rant. Ignorance is horrible, and is the cause of many problems in our country and around the world. Hopefully one day everyone will realize that all kinds are equal."
4,Great Movie,If you want a long review there are plenty here. I can't say anything new except for watch the color imagery that is compared in the opening scene and the final scene. You will see what I am referring to.
4,Life is too short for hate,"Hate... Hate and love are the two most powerful emotions in the world. The two of these emotions can be taken too extremes, and when they do, very powerful events can happen. In American History X, the feeling of hate is overwhelming. Derrick radiates this hate to all that surrounds him. He holds this rage inside, and lets it consume his life. He is so blinded by his hate that he does not take the time to see all sides of the story. The death of his father just seemed to justify thoughts that were already implanted in his head. American History X, shows this powerful emotion of hate like no other movie has been able to do. The reality and no nonsense presentation of the movie are what touches each person so deeply. To capture the essence of hate is a very powerful thing. The movie was able to capture the idea that hate can take over and run your life. You become blind to what you are actually doing, and become desensitized to all other human emotions."
5,Hate and fear explained with maestra,"If you don't know why you fear or hate something or someone, watch this movie ! It is a good reflexion over racism and where our civilizations go in general. And don't forget that American people are where they are now cause they hated and killed native Indians..."
3,Labtech Gaming Headset,I bought not to game but because it was recommended for an on-line class. I found the headset to be uncomfortable after about an hour of wearing. The pinching effect made the skin behind my ears sore.
4,Valuable insight into the Middle Class workforce,"Terkel has put together a valuable compilation of interviews that share important views into the psyche of the American worker. There are pieces from all types of people - factory workers, waiters, stewardesses, even teenagers. Being able to see first hand how various people feel about their job and the behind the scenes issues they have to deal with is really interesting and in some cases, eye opening. My only issue is that the book is very limited to what Terkel wants us to see. Some sections, for example, only have stories from women when a man's perspective would be welcome."
5,Fascinating look at what we do with the bulk of our time,"Working profiles the working lives of scores of Americans. From prostitute to chief executive, coal mine worker to major league ballplayer- a myriad of professions are covered. The book reads like a documentary (which it is). Terkel has included the most interesting aspects of each case study's working life, and ultimately you see why each continues to pursue their career in that chosen field- or at least what satisfaction they get from showing up everyday. It's a great book to pick up and spend 5 to 10 minutes or so reading about how someone else's working life has parallels to your own. The interviews were conducted mostly during the late 60's and early 70's but while it is slightly dated, even that fact makes for an interesting historical perspective."
3,Sound so bad you'll beg for mercy,"As other reviewers note, the sound quality of these live recordings are pretty poor, and -- as great as Charlier Parker is on many of these solos -- it's really a chore to sit through them. For the beginning Bird fan, I would start with one of the excellent collections of his Savoy and Dial recordings, move onto his Verve recordings, and then sample some of his better ""live"" recordings, which are:- The Town Hall concert with Dizzy Gillsepie- The Massey Hall recordings, again with Dizzy- The Complete Savoy Live recordings""Bird on 52nd Street"" should be on your shopping list only if you've tapped out all the other sources of both studio and live Charlier Parker.Of course, it's Bird, so even horribly recorded, it merits a few stars. But don't torture yourself with this."
2,Great Bird-but the recording is very rough around the edges,"The material here is great-he is, after all, playing with Miles Davis. But, you never get to appreciate the cd fully because the songs seem like they're cut-off in the middle and and the sound quality is a little too staticky to fully appreciate these great Jazz musicians-and Max Roach's drums sound like he's a kid (a musical genius kid) playing on a pile of books with a couple of pencils. But, if you can past the noise and the truncated tunes and appreciate jazz masters recorded live in a vintage show, then buy this cd and imagine that it's 1948 and it's raining-maybe hailing and you'll love it."
4,Smart Author with Healthy Vocabulary,"I enjoyed Brennan Manning's A Glimpse of Jesus, but I had to read it slowly because his vocabulary was a little over my head. This Book is for Christians only. He uses a lot of Scripture and has great insight into Scripture."
5,Wonderful book,"Like Manning's other books this reaffirms that one can not hold fast to the truth of Christ's compassion and at the same time our own self doubt or it's darker twin self hatred. There are real gems in this book and you walk away knowing that Christ's love is truly boundless and in that love we are truly accepted. Manning writes of real life struggles and does not mince words. This is a modern mystic that, in my opinion, stands with the classics of the Desert Fathers and is readable by all. Manning is a joy in the Christ he serves."
1,Fr. Manning preaches lies - don't be one of the deceived!!!!!,"Fr. Brennan Manning is a Franciscan priest who attempted to marry without being dispensed from his vow of celibacy in 1982. He has since peddled a false gospel that is built around the idea that God's pardon is unconditional - a euphemism for saying that you can be forgiven for your sins without repenting and amending your life. This is a lie, and a defense mechanism Fr. Manning has evolved to assuage his guilty conscience. If you really want to seek the Mercy of God, I suggest you read ""Divine Mercy in my soul"", the diary of St. Faustina, avaulable here on Amazon.com. God's Mercy is endless, but you cannot be pardoned if you are not sorry; Fr. Manning's false gospel will do you no more spiritual good than it has done him. He needs your prayers and your pity - not your money or your reading time."
2,Many typos and inconsistencies in answers,"This book has a useful format, but it is riddled with typos and inconsistency between the instructions and the answers given. The errors are so many that it interferes with a beginner's ability to learn. I know all books have a few wrong answers in the back, but this numbers in the 10-20 per chapter range, sometimes more. I hope they reedit it, because I did like the design. If they do, they should expand the conversions section to include more household and apothecary problems. The CD is just a condensed version of the book, no new problems to work on."
1,Error & Typos!!!!,"I bought this book through Elsevier to study for NCLEX-RN. 2 days and so far i found 2 typos and errors.IV Calculation section - I found entries in the equations which was not mention in the problem in the first place. So you wonder, where did that came from....I'm sure there are better Drug Calculation book with concise and correct information. This book is NOT!!!"
3,Just Okay - May Be Better Ones Available,"This book was on my ""required"" list, even though we never use it in class. I used it a couple of times to look up formulas for drips/min but other than that I have not used it. I tried to do some practice problems out of it but the method that they use is not the same as the one we use in class and it has been more confusing than helpful. If you need extra practice and are willing to dig through this then try to find a cheap one. Otherwise I would look for a better teaching book."
5,College Books,"I ordered these books for college at a very reasonable price. As all of my purchases from Amazon.com, I received them in a very timely manner of about three days. The books were in excellent condition. I recommend everyone order their college books through Amazon as I am very satisfied."
3,Bad Turned Good,"This was a brand new book. I received it in a reasonable time but this book was a mess. The corners were all bent, there were pages crinkled, and about 20 pages in the back were torn halfway up off the binding. I did return it and I got a new one very fast without any charge. I was very pleased with the whole return process, and customer service couldn't have been nicer."
4,good text book,"Excellent text-book. Useful information, well organized, good examples. An easier and more interesting read than some. Includes a (small) section on Procrastination which identifies with me a little too well (in fact, guess what I'm doing right now?). :)The reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is just because it is a text book and I was forced to read it. However, I think I'd much rather read this one than something else."
4,Getting ready to tell the story,"Having thought about, started, restarted, and given up on several novels over the years, I have nonetheless continued to think of myself as a writer. Recently, in my ""real"" life, I was part of an event that I believe warrants coverage as narrative nonfiction, and no one in the world is better positioned than I am to tell the story. But, how to start? Peter Rubie's book has been a great help in getting me ready to take my proposal to agents. He describes the genre and what makes good narrative. He has many helpful suggestions for conducting research--especially on conducting interviews. He offers great advice on contacting and interesting an agent. And, finally, he gives a useful tutorial on producing the killer proposal. Although I have other books on proposal writing and marketing that are more detailed, I'm glad I started with this book."
2,Not happy with morals,"During the sled dog movie the ""hero"" of the story is told by his father to beat his sled dog ,or it wouldn't respect him- and he did beat it. Isn't this showing children that beating animals is the only way to work with them? I think this is sending a bad message about the treatment of animals. Both my dogs ( one being a Rottweiler X Pit Bull mix) respect me, and I've never beaten either one of them."
5,Great stuff,We just got a brand new dishwasher and decided to switch to a detergent without harsh chemicals. This is a great product. I highly recommend it.
4,Ok for folks with MCS,"It does a good job cleaning the dishes, but sometimes it may leave a little bit of soap on a couple of dishes so after dishwasher cuts off, I rinse one more time and they come out perfect. Well worth it for people with MCS. I get about 25 loads out of a box. Jerry"
3,Disappointed,"I bought a box of Seventh Generation Free & Clear dish powder because I want to use toxic-free cleaning products in my home. While the dish powder did remove all the dirt and grime and leave the dishes clean in that sense, it left a white powdery residue on the heating coils, calphalon cooking spoons, and my clear glasses. For now I'll just be using Cascade instead."
2,Incorrect part for U.S. electricity,This product is supposed to supply power to a laptop by both a cigarette outlet in a vehicle or through an electrical outlet. The electrical outlet plug supplied is not compatible with U.S. electricity. I returned it twice and still got a plug that can not be used in the United States.
4,Boogie On,"It took me many years to buy a Canned Heat album sans at least one of the founding three Bob Hite, Alan Wilson and Henry Vestine.Of couse founder Larry Taylor was there and early addition Fito de la Parra were there, but I was still warry. But, now I've done it and I am glas that I did. This is a sound effort of blues and boogie with a dash of jazz thrown into the mix. Nothing slick or fancy, but just good ole Canned Heat sounds. If you liked em in the '60's and early '70's, grab this overlooked cd and enjoy yourself. So, run, eh, rather, boogie out and get it!"
5,The Doctor and Sir William Wallace types,"Those Scottish Lords, they are always fighting. So what if a Time Warrior lands his spacecraft and starts a Star Trek style guns for work plan to help him rebuild his spaceship? Well, as usual, The Doctor strays into the camp and starts his intervention plans. Great stuff!"
1,Garbage - do not buy,"I had this unit for 1.5 years. Worked for a while then started to ""eat"" my DVD RW disks........they would only record for 20-30 recordings. First thought it was the disks I bought but happened with all brands. Then it wouldn't play DVD movies from Blockbuster........that was the final straw...........I threw it out. Not worth it at any price! Agree totally with other negative reviews listed here."
4,Right for the price,"Don't expect a Corvette when you're paying a Kia price. I bought one of these dvd recorders five years ago and it worked just fine for all those years. Now that it died, I went right out and looked for the exact same brand. For 68 bucks, if I can get another five years out of this one, I'm a happy camper."
1,Company appears to be out of business.,"I have had nothing but problems, I have update the firmware twice, and still it messes up. Do not but, no support, no help. I guess in this case I really got what I paid for."
1,Garbage,It's horrible. Don't buy. All it does is eat DVD-R/RW's. It doesn't close when it ends a reording so it's a waste of money. Stay away from it.
1,Hope they are out of business... Just TRASH,"0 Stars for ratings. About 7 or 8 months ago they sent first a DVD with firmweare upgrade. Then, they changed the unit. Only worked 3 more times. Now Does not even play a full prerecorded DVD. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."
1,Not a wise choice.,"The recorder continually destroys the DVDs. You'd be lucky to ever get to the end of the recording without getting a bad disc or disc error message, which means you have to dump your dvd and start from scratch. I've tried many different brands of DVDs and still the same problem each time. Not much support from the website either."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS !,"Company will not answer phone, website does notwork, Police raided them for unlicensed products.My unit died 2 days after Warranty expired.Product CANNOT be repaired.."
3,"DON""T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!","Too upset to comment. Just brought this product this afternoon and I am returning it first thing tomorrow morning. Its respone to the remote is slow. The TV turner doesn't work and the list continues . . . If I could give this no stars, I would!"
1,Cannot use universal remote,"The remote control that comes with this unit is the only one that we can get to work with the unit. Since there are only play/pause, eject, record, and standby/on controls on the front of the unit, if you lose the OEM remote you can no longer navigate menus or skip ahead/back. This is constantly a real pain in our family since we habitually lose the small remote that came with the unit and cannot use the other three universal remotes to control it.Also, we have had problems recording DVDs - sometimes it messes up during formatting the disk and leaves in unusable -- sometimes we record a disc-full of programs only to find that they are unplayable later."
2,Not the greatest pump,Barely pumps anything out. Great if you only need to pump a tiny amount till you can breastfeed or pump with another pump.
2,"Be cautious of review by ""Baby Enthusiast from Dayton Ohio""","This reviewer's use of words and phrases is quite similar to that found on the company website. This reviewer also doesn't share much of her own experience, other than saying ""it's the best pump ever.""I personally am not familiar with the pump and can't comment on it (so my star rating is exactly what the current ""average reviews"" indicates), but did want to comment on this review... it might be a totally valid review, but it's certainly radically different than the other reviewers!"
1,Leaks like a sieve,"The worst of the worst, I ended up with more milk in my lap than in the bottle. I had a Avent last time and it was so much better and so much more effecient. I really suggest NOT wasting your money on the Evenflo model!"
2,Don't waste your money.,"I purchased this pump when I went back to work so I could remain breastfeeding. This pump does not encourage the natural let down process and the vacuum adjuster gives either too much or too little suction. The pump also leaks extremeley bad. I went back and purchased the Avent Isis pump, which was a much better investment."
2,A waste of money...,"I bought this a few months before my son was born, so that I would have ""something"" in the house. When I started feeding him, I realized that this one wasn't worth it. It leaks badly, and doesn't have a very strong suction, even on the highest setting. Also, it is very easy to ""over pump"" the handle, causing the pump to jump its seal and loose strength/power. Not to mention, it's tiring to use.."
3,I was suprised by how efficient this pump is..,"I normally would stay away from Evenflo pumps, because of their reputation, but I got this one at clearance .... I also have an Avent Isis pump. I think the Isis is a sturdier pump and will hold up longer. However, the Evenflo pump is easier to put together and clean, almost as efficient, and I can pump directly into the standard bottles my baby drinks from. I find this pump to be almost as easy to use as the Avent.It also comes with adaptors for the Evenflo elite bottles. If you use that bottle for feeding, it's almost worth buying 2 of these pumps just for the adaptor."
2,"Better than electric, but not nearly as good at Isis!","I gave this pump 2 stars only because it produced more milk output than the electic doulble breast pump I used, but it definitely leaks and is not nearly as comfortable nor produces as much milk output as the Isis Manual Breast Pump. Spend the extra money and by the Isis, you will save yourself time, frustration and money in the long run! I even got this pump on sale and it still wasn't worth the money."
1,Leaky pump,"I bought this pump as my second evenflo pump. My first one was the electric one(that just quit working after 3 uses). This pump has failed me several times. It leaks around the top when not held in the EXACT way it says. After having problems with this pump and my other evenflo pump I called the 1-800 number on the box and got a recording 5 different times telling me that they were experiencing ""high call volume"" and could I try my call again at a later date. I was then disconnected. I wouldn't recommend this pump to anyone. If you are deciding on breastfeeding and are going back to work after your maternity leave, I highly suggest investing in a better pump. I thought I was getting a bargain for the price, but I got what I paid for...twice. Don't be affraid to spend the extra money once instead of three times like myself."
5,Eclectic excellence!,"Aoife is a wonderful singer and the nature of the songs on this CD is quiet varied. But the last piece, ""Mother and Child"", is worth the price of admission alone. It made an old Marine tear up with memories of his mother."
4,Jasmine & musk makes me smile,"This is a lovely gift my husband got me for my birthday.I love it,and him."
4,Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen,Well written and easy to understand. I really liked the matter of fact voice it was written in and the Appendix references.
1,FDA RECALL,"I got hydroxycut, and yes-- it did curb my appetite... but it's not worth it for these results:FDA received reports of serious health problems ranging from jaundice and elevated liver enzymes, an indicator of potential liver injury, to liver damage requiring liver transplant. One death due to liver failure has been reported to the FDA. Other health problems reported include seizures; cardiovascular disorders; and rhabdomyolysis, a type of muscle damage that can lead to other serious health problems such as kidney failure."
4,SPEEDY DELIVERY!!!,I've now began using this product so I'm am unable to say how much weight will be affected. The product arrived in a blink of an eye and transaction went very smooth. No problems with this seller. It has only been 2 days and I can definitely say that my energy levels has increased already. I really don't feel as tired as I have become accustomed to whether i'm working out or not and I cannot wait to see the end results of using this product.
3,Well it gives side effects,I been only in this product on 2 days then i switched Chitosan and still waiting for the results. I dont know why people have been saying that weight loss pills gives you strength if it gives you jitters and make you shaky while working out that makes people thinks you're nuts
3,The service was slow.,"I am not rating it 3 because the product was bad, I am rating it 3 because it took 2 weeks (and a day out of the range) to arrive. I understand that the package comes from Japan and had to travel all across USA to make it here but at least that should be in the description. I spent 2 weeks waiting to transport my shinai properly. The product itself is nice, it even has a strap on the back to carry it on your shoulder but as of now I cannot determine the durability or any defect since I just got it."
4,Works for Me,"Flimsy, but works for me and the price is right. Would buy again if nothing better comes along. Not granddaughter-proof."
2,Clunky clamps,These clamps are kinda flimsy-probably why they are cheap. Table edge must be exact size of the clamp or it doesn't work well. What are the odds of all tables being the same size?
1,Don't buy,It didn't work and wasn't damaged by shipping. The company said to send it back then they didn't give another one. After some time they said they were out of them. I didn't get my money back and I don't think anybody should buy from this company!!!
1,3 cd cassette player,"I bought this with hopes of getting a nice stereo. HOWEVER, I didn't receieve the product and I questioned the seller of its whereabouts. I was giving a refund but the stereo arrived. The box was torn to pieces and it was broken once I opened it. I threw it away and promised never to buy stereos that seem too good to be true.- - Msz. BuTAbeAN - -"
1,disatisfied with product and response from company,"The remote for the product did not work. When I notified Amazon, I was told I had to purchase a universal remote. that is not acceptable. I had to contact the manufacturer myself and although it eventually sent me another remote, it does not work either. Very disappointed with this purchase."
1,THIS ONLY WORKED FOR A FEW DAYS AFTER IT ARRIVED...!!!! ITS BEEN BROKEN SINCE I BOUGHT IT...???,I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ITEM SO ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS BUYER BEWARE...! ITS BEEN BROKEN SINCE DAYS AFTER IT ARRIVED...???
4,Great Buy!,"This is a magnificent stereo. I got it for my mother, and it worked beautifully. The sound was great, it lokks very fancy. Yes, it is cheap, but it is a great buy!"
2,not as pleased as i thought i'd be,"Usually impressed with KitchenAid products - - - I accidently put it in the dishwasher - - ONCE - - all pitted and rusted. It was great until that happened. I own a collection of CUTCO - - - I've accidently put them in the dishwasher as well, even though they don't recommend it - -- NO PROBLEMS!!!! So, I would not recommend!!"
5,britte blade,"Good knife it does a lot better job dicing and slicing than any conventional knife we own does I am gonna get the set they have that matches this, edited from here did not get set since original review while chopping onions I tapped it gently on cutting board to shake sticking diced onion off the blade broke off 1 inch from handle I really liked the handle I do the same with all our knives and no problems"
5,Great knife for a little money!,"I could not be happier with this knife. It is very solid, feels good in the hand, has a good weight, and best of all.....it's sharp. It keeps a good edge and a few strokes on the sharpening steel freshens the edge right up. This a better knife than many I've seen that cost considerably more. A great value!"
4,Different from other knives,"This is a very well designed knife. The weight, size, and width of the blade all seem to work in concert. If I have one complaint it would be its sharpness. I think I expected something miraculously sharp.Another benefit of the design is its stability, which makes it feel safe."
3,Cute moves,"Carmen Electra's Vegas Strip DVD has some cute moves on it. But it wasn't reallt physically exerting. It's a good DVD if you wanna pick up a couple moves, but not so much if you're trying to burn serious calories."
2,Terrible,Another terrible release. Nothing new from the other DVDs. All the moves are similar to what she has already taught.
3,Not the greatest but not bad at all,"I expected a little more from electra but the workout is fun and makes you feel sexy. the quality isnt the best, looks like the editor didnt care too much but it is a workout none the less. the dance is fun and maybe something to show off once you get it down"
5,completely satisfied!,"This video is good for people who have a little dancing experience. For the avid dancer it would be too low key, and for the lacking-dancing-experience it has potential to be hard to follow. But I love it and definitely feel the effects!"
1,"I don't work out, and this was a joke.","I bought this dvd because I had read some reviews about it being a low impact workout and thought that since I don't workout much, I should give it a shot as a beginning workout program.What a joke!I didn't even break a sweat the first ten minutes. And the choreography was so bad I finally turned it off. Glad I didn't spend too much on this! Please believe all the negative reviews and save your money!"
2,"Wow, amazon's rating system is becoming pointless","It's a shame that amazon mixes the ratings for all the other Carmen Electra DVDs with this one. It takes a little time to filter through them all to find which ones are for this particular DVD, which is a pretty terrible routine. I couldn't even finish it...boring moves, lots of lag time that wasn't edited out...just Carmen waiting for the music to start. And she wasn't really engaging. It was horrible as a workout; I probably could've walked in place and gotten a better workout. I like the first set, cause it is new and fun, but this follow up is kinda pointless."
1,Didn't learn a D@MN THING!!!,"I brought this video based off of the rating. What a mistake. Please read the negative reviews first so you can save your money.This was ridiculous. I am pretty sure Carmen is a nice person and a great dancer but she is a bad instructor. If you want to buy this dvd for a great workout are a new routine, please be prepared to rewind rewind rewind each portion of the routine. Also she had too many steps within each portion. And the worst part of this video is the end. Once you spent however many hours learning the routine, she shows you the last part then says ""lets take it from the beginning"". Then it goes to a club scene. The routine becomes all about her and forgets that it is an instructional video. I was dumb founded. Such a waste of my MONEY."
2,Not like the original series,"This DVD is missing a lot of the nice features that the original series had, like the option of switching between the types of music or programming a workout. This DVD is also missing the warm-up excercise. The way the DVD was created, they go through the moves very quickly. Also, the final dance is more for a man to watch then for a woman to learn. Many of the camera shots are ""head shots"" and not of the whole body. You can not see the moves they are executing. Oh, if you didn't know, it's definitely not the same choregrapher from the PussyCat Dolls. The steps seem harder but the dance is longer."
1,Not exercise,"All of Carmen's ""exercise"" videos are no challenge at all. She made the videos so people can lust over her and, of course, to make money. This did not help me burn calories nor learn any seductive moves..."
1,Holy ripoff!,"Is this a joke? First of all, this film is no longer made. So this is probably expired film. I still have some expired iZone film, and it's basically useless. Second of all, this is a huge ripoff."
4,very good product,"its a great product, the price is reasonable considering that this kind of film is discontinued. Thanks for the item."
2,just not that interesting,"A few of the stories were really enjoyable, but overall, it just wasn't that interesting. I had a hard time getting into the stories or following the flow. Not a keeper."
4,Interesting Women,"Intriguing collection of short stories based around female moments in history (many from the author's native Ireland.)I found myself motivated to look up some of these women on the internet- Frances Cobbe, who devoted her life to the anti-vivisection movement; Elspeth Buchan who led a religious cult in the 1790s; Dido Bell, a black girl brought up as daughter of the house by her titled white uncle in the era of the slave trade. Each story is followed by background information on the characters mentioned.Well written and original."
5,TU CORAZON IS OVERFLOWING!!,THIS MOVIE WAS DYNAMIC AND ROMANTIC. IT TOUCHED ME BOTH IN THE HEART AND IN MY FEET. I NOW TAKE LATIN DANCE LESSONS IN HOPES OF FEELING THE MUSIC THE WAY CHAYANNE AND VANESSA DID IN THE MOVIE. THE DANCE SCENES SWEPT ME AWAY TO LATIN CLUBS EVERYWHERE URGING ME TO DANCE WHEREEVER I FEEL THE BEAT. I GIVE IT 100 STARS!!!
3,My two heroes,"When I placed this disc on my player I had no idea that by the time the credits popped up I would have two completely unexpected people on my mind as the heroes of the movie, with their cameos: the black woman dancer featured at what is supposed to be Santiago de Cuba, the one who is first seen at the window fanning herself, and who descends to the dance floor to go into a frenzied whirl of hips. Oh, God, does anybody know who she is? I tried to track her name on the credits lists, but she wasn't there. That was some dancing. Even the camera had problems to totally capture her movements! I wish she was featured on the finals. My second hero, who I didn't expect to see on the flick, is my fellow-countryman (Angolan) Ricardo Lemvo who makes an appearance for an electrifying rendering of his super-hit ""Mama Kiyelele"" with his Makina Loca. Please tell me who that dancer in ""Santiago de Cuba"" is ..."
2,Junk + time = waste of time,"It's about ballroom competitors. Out of all the ballroom competition movies out there, this one is the least entertaining. ""Shall We Dance"" is way better."
3,Chayanne is more then this movie shows,"This movie is pretty good, but could be a lot better if chayanne was able to show his real talents. If you have ever seen him in concert live or not, you know he can really move- and not just to some old-fashioned cuban folk music. Besides, he is Puerto Rican, and the movie should have set in PR where Chayanne lived all this life. I saw his house but I couldn't get through the gate. I sent him a letter but it came back. Get this vid, but see him live or on TV! He is HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Tortilla Chips without the Chile Sauce,"If you're looking for a movie that is hot and sexy with lots of dancing - give this one a miss. As an avid Salsa fan I could not wait to see this but I was hugely disappointed. Saying it started slow would be an understatement, it crawled painfully along on it's belly. The dancing came in fits and bursts, there was no 'big dance moment'. I felt like I was being teased right the way through, I kept thinking ""it's going to start now, it's going to start now"". Way to much emphasis was given to the love story (which was ashamedly unoriginal) and not enough to the dancing (which was average when there was any). If Chayanne hadn't been such a gorgeous specimen of a human being I would have bailed out after half an hour. I felt his full potential was not shown(innocent smile), I'm certain he had a hot tortilla lurking in there somewhere, if only he had given us a bite!"
1,Avoid it like the plague.,"This movie was horrible. After reading some of the good reviews I tried to watch it but had to turn it off. The plot is a little simplistic, but I don't mind that; it's the astounding gaps in the storyline that made this movie ridiculous to watch. The Cuban man who can't dance professionally, just with his heart, starts off cleaning floors, then all of a sudden is doing ballet, and with absolutely no transition is in a dance contest in Las Vegas. Literally, that's not a summary, that's how it went. Horrible production and editing. Acting not bad, and the 3 minutes of dancing in 2 hours was decent; but not as good as any other dance movie out there."
4,Favorite Dance Movie,"If you like dancing, particularly salsa, you'll love this movie. It's been around for a while, but I still enjoy watching it. It also doesn't hurt that I know several of the performers. Really good dance movie!"
5,Beautiful Love Story,"I love this movie! Vanessa Williams looks incredible in this movie and her partner Chayanne looks so handsome too. I absolutely enjoyed the part where Ruby and Rafael go to the Salsa Club TITON and Dance together so wonderfully, it was so much fun to watch them together. Rafael was such a gentleman to her when he walked with her back to her apartment. My favorite part of the film was that WHITE HOT love scene!!! I love the way he touches her and kisses her, I definitely would've love to see them make passionate love to each other full on nudity and everything. Vanessa looked stunning in her costume and makeup in the dance sequences plus I definitely want a Rafael of my own and I'm an Dark Chocolate African-American female. Too bad Vanessa and Chayanne can't get together in real life because they would be beautiful together. I would like to see another movie similar to this from Williams and Chayanne."
1,Boring Cliche,"I was invited by my friend's mom and sister to watch this movie. To be polite, I had no choice but to sit down and watch the whole thing and pretend that I enjoyed it. It might be great for people who like dancing movies, but to me, every minute of it was torture.You can guess what happens. Just like in every other dance movie that has ever been made, an unlikely dance couple is thrust into each other's arms. They must defy all odds and learn how to dance like the wind and somehow achieve glory in some ""highly touted"" dance competition. Woopty do.Guys, if you are thinking about renting a chick flick to impress your significant other and are considering ""Dance with Me,"" let me tell you, this one should definitely be avoided. There are other ""light romantic comedies"" out there that are much more bearable than this one."
3,"Dance, dance, dance",Good story line. Nick Nolte added a lot and Williams is a living fox on the dance floor. Have seen this movie many times and trying to duplicate some of the latin moves. Great workout!
4,Good Escapism...,I recommend this film for watching when it's cold and rainy. Both main characters are good looking and energetic. This music is what got it for me. You cannot watch this movie without being enraptured by the Cuban beat.
5,CHAYANNE IS WAY BETTER THAN ANTONIO BANDERAS,"SOME HAD INQUIRED ABOUT CHAYANNE'S UPCOMING VISITS TO THE UNITED STATES. CHAYANNE LIVES IN MIAMI, FLORIDA AND WILL BE TOURING THIS SPRING. IF YOU GO TO LYCOS AND ENTER CHAYANNE. YOU CAN SEE HIS UPCOMING TOUR SCHEDULE WHICH STARTS IN CALIFORNIA, THEN DALLAS, HOUSTON, EL PASO, CHICAGO NEW YORK AND MIAMI. I LIVE IN CHICAGO AND I ALREADY HAVE MY TICKETS. I DID SEE THIS MOVIE TWICE IN THE THEATRES AND HAVE RENTED A COUPLE OF TIME. I LOVE THE MUSIC AND THE DANCING. BEING PUERTO RICAN, I CAN TELL YOU THAT CHAYANNE MADE US VERY PROUD IN DISPLAYING HIS TALENTS NOT ONLY AS A SINGER, ACTOR AND NOW A DANCER. I FEEL THAT HE IS NOT THE NEXT ANTONIO BANDERAS, HE MUCH BETTER AND YOUNGER THAN BANDERAS. IT IS A SHAME THAT HE WAS NOT PICK FOR THE ROLE OF ZORRO. IT WOULD OF BEEN ALOT MORE INTERESTING TO WATCH."
3,"Good, but I've seen better","I enjoy this show, but as a ballroom dancer, this movie did have a lot of problems. The competition scene itself was hopelessly off. If you're going to display a ballroom competition, at LEAST get it right! The comp they showed is nothing like a real competition, you get nothing of the real feel of what ballroom is. Someone looking to get hooked on the dance style will be sorely disappointed if that's what they're expecting. There's a lot more to it than this movie shows. More to the point, I'd like to see a ballroom movie that employs REAL ballroom dancers, people who actually know what they're doing. That could bring a whole new kind of charisma to the screen. Other than that, though...the music was incredible, very dance-able, it made me want to get out and samba the night away. The story was only halfway, and sort of muddy at times, like they were trying to put TOO much into it, but not too bad. Still, give me Strictly Ballroom any day."
5,It was cute and entertaining,I have seen this movie a few times.Actually I got this for a friend as a Birthday Present since she is big fan of Chayan.
4,my friends and i love this movie!,"a lot of my friends have seen this movie,the girls love Chayanne, the guys, of course,Vanessa Williams!i admit the plot is weak! great acting debut for Chayanne especially in the towel! music is so good! i even have the soundtrack!"
4,great dance movie,"This is a nice movie. Not an Oscar winner, but very pleasant and no sex (a virtue/shortcoming depending on your point of view). I purchased the movie for the salsa dancing, but all of the dancing and music in the movie are great. From the opening scenes staged in Cuba to the last dance scene the the movie is big time fun. It also is beautifully filmed. Chaynne and Vanessa are both easy on the eyes so each gender will enjoy it. The movie is defintely worth a viewing."
3,Watch it for the dancing,"Latin heartthrob Chayanne can sing. Chayanne can dance. Chayanne can teach Ricky Martin a thing or two about moving the hips. But, Chayanne cannot act very well. Vanessa Williams basically has to carry the movie because Chayanne, when he is not dancing...does very little for the film. But, when Chayanne is dancing all the bets are off. The passion in the dance sequences is palpable, the dancing is amazing and darn...it looks like fun!The film's plot has been done in many many other films. So, it is not only predictable, it is downright scene by scene a what every dance movie til then and since then has done. But, don't watch it for the predictable plot. The strengths of this movie lies in the dancing...because it is Latin hot! Trust me, I am Latin ;-)"
5,Romantically breath taking!,"This movie made me laugh, cry and on my feet to dance along with the great music and dancers. Cheyenne and Vanessa were wonderful. You must see this great movie. I did 7 times. Viva salsa!"
4,FUN MOVIE,"This movie is great. Vanessa Williams is not only beautiful, but you would think she has been competing in professional Latin dancing for real-she is very talented. Chyayanne also heats up the dance floor and is very charming-not to mention easy on the eyes. The dance scenes are HOT!! It is loaded with not only great dances, but great Latin music and likable characters. It is fun from beginning to end and will leave you wanting to hit the dance floor!!!"
3,"Dance 10, Story 3","Overdone story line. Bad acting on Kristofferen's part and even if Chayanne is a hearthrob in Cuba or Latin America...he can't act.His Spanish dialogue made him more believable that his English.Vanessa Williams whom I love fell flat.Great dance sequences in the salsa club and at the end. Otherwise the dance numbers were right out of Stictly Ballroom.Story could have had more latin heat! ! ! As a latino myself, I wanted more heat and less of the tired old story line of boy meets girl. This could have been a wonderful ""learn how to dance like a latino in heat"" story! Not the bad love story it wanted to be.Gave it 3 Stars for the DANCING...and 1 Star for the story and acting."
3,Vanni Makes This Movie Watchable....,"...the majors here, Vanessa and Cheyanne, gives the viewer an eyeful (Vanessa still is one of the most beautiful women in the world) with stunning dance steps and good genes and jeans, but don't expect something of depth from this movie. Bunuel, Fellini, it ain't, but, then again, mebbe it doesn't require the sophistication of Bunuel or Fellini..."
5,best book to the original trilogy,"as I said on the headline. Thee cheerleader books that r better r The sagas #10 The awakening evil, and the evil lives ( haven't read the new evil.I like the cheerleaders because I like the idea of a evil spirit that pocesses people."
3,Don't exactly know what to think about this one.,"I have read all the cheerleader books, and this was one of the weirdest. I liked it and everything, but it wasn't all that good. It was more sad than scary."
4,Cheerleaders : The Third Evil,"In the third book about Corky and the squad, the girls go to a very creepy camp! Still upset about her sister Bobbi's tragic death, Corky finally thinks the spirt killing her sister and members from the squad is gone. Guess Again!I would rate this book only 4 stars because I read the series out of order and began with the 3rd one. It didn't make as much since, it was still good though. Recommemded for anybody who loves Fear Street!"
4,My boy's love this toy !!,"This is a fun toy for kids. My 4 year old needs help building the color pattern. They dont play the game much, just like to build and knock it down with the jack hammer. So they build different stacks and knock out one at a time to see how many can be knocked out without it falling. I have had this for about 2 years and it still works. I would recommend for ages 3 to 5."
5,"Another great statement from C. H. Kadie, Jr","I was only two years old when Mr. Kadie spoke at Berkeley, so it was with great excitement that I found that his statement has been preserved. Sadly, it seems to have, somehow, fallen out of print. Those who would like to read a copy may have better luck borrowing a copy from U.C. Berkeley, where it is in the ""WRCA"" library and has call number ""G4099 J4""."
5,an improvement on an already perfected methodology,"This is the better mousetrap. In this last book by Ken Keyes, finished just before he died, Ken introduces EMDR, Harville Hendrix, Ron Kurtz's Hakomi, and other therapies as much faster ways of getting rid of addictions than using his classic methods (which themselves are efficacious at achieving positive results with zero side-effects)"
4,A moment between laundry and dishes,"I have enjoyed Live in the Moment. For me, a stay at home mom with three children, life is less overwhelming if it's tackled moment by moment. Julie Clark Robinson, has a way with writing that is fresh and inviting. She has grasped who she is, the good with the bad, inviting women to do the same. Her quirkiness is refreshing and just the kind of stories I long to read during my two minute breaks between laundry and dishes. She is inspiring, encouraging women to look beyond the spilled cereal and mounds of laundry and capture each day not by the seasons,years, or months, but moment by moment."
5,Live in the Moment,"Julie Clark Robinson has a very unique way of turning everyday trials into laughter. Live in the Moment is very easy reading.It is a book that can relate to any woman at any age. You catch yourself laughing one minute, then wanting to cry the next. It is a very real, raw and candid guide not to waste your life on frivilous things that we cannot change. The book has helped me put the past where is belongs and cherrish the relationships that I have today."
5,Fabulous!,This is a wonderfully inspiring book that helped to remind me that something good and postitive can come of every situtation if you look at it right. And to go into everyday thinking YAY LIFE!
3,CD review,Slow on arrival. There were only a few sides that I liked but the distributors fault. The CD was clean and as described.
2,Disappointed,"In my search for great jazz piano trios, I was fortunate to stumble upon Red Garland's work early on. And, based on the ""must have it"" review above, I bought this CD. While Red's playing is clean and pure, as always, this whole CD is marred by the bass solos. Why any jazz bass blayer feels the need to bring a bow to the recording session is beyond me. My fast-forward button is working overtime on this one."
5,BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO SUCCEED,"I purchased this book before starting a publishing company. We followed Avery Cardoza's advice and steps carefully. His writing is straightforward and the steps are not difficult to follow. We published our first book a few weeks ago, set up a distributor and are now off and running. This book will get you through the publishing process."
5,All the information you need.,"Whether you're considering starting your own publishing company or you'd like to self-publish a book, this gives you absolutely all the information you could possibly need. From registering a company name and getting the ISBN to the actual layout and printing of the book, it's all there! I thought I'd have to buy several books to learn everything I'd need to do, but this ended up being the most comprehensive guide I could find. I ended up sending my book to a publisher instead of publishing it on my own, but my closest friend in the world used this book to start his business and he's been amazingly successful! Even if the edition is a few years old, it's suprisingly relevant and accurate. It's a great buy and I recommend it to anyone even thinking of self-publishing, starting a publishing business, or even just a career in publishing."
1,I prefer the ed & cust. reviewers vs Garbage(the book),"My sister and her husband have a copy of A. R. Ammon's ""Garbage"" on one of their book shelves..in curiosity I browsed a page or two..than browed amazon.com's editorial and customer reviews..the reviews(in my opinion) elevate the book of a poem to a height of accomplished when in truth it is reflecting the yawn of a benign vs the cum si,cum sa benign with the question ""WHERE DO I GO TO NOW?"" (as stated and reinstated in the movie ""Evita"").A.R.Ammons(according to the reviews is concerned about his ability as a person to find enough facets within himself to not need to search for something(anything ) to be a valued focus.You must not be a 'bore' in order to prevent boredom(many a person who does nothing(often for R&R:Rest & Relaxation) has acomplished in their own subliminal(due to attitude) enough perception that they are not overwhelmed when there is a lack of 'do or die' outside of themself. 8/7/01 ..."
4,Quick and to the point,"The idea is to cut-and-paste segments from classical biographers into a relatively cohesive narrative of Alexander's life and exploits. Over all, the project comes off fairly well. It reads quickly, hitting all the expected the highlights. A nice sampling of the ""original"" sources; a short book that would serve well as an introduction to the topic."
3,Allow Me To Be Brief...I Wish This Movie Had Been,"I think half the problem here in this lavish and well-acted production was its makers had no heavenly idea where on earth they wanted to go with the story they were trying to tell, and so what resulted was one of the more muddled, messed-up letdowns in recent big-budget TV history. The acting was good, the settings and sets themselves were amazing, but the plot was headache-inducing in its lack of direction. The film spent hours concentrating on rather drawn-out side stories and ignored opportunities to present gripping history as it unfolded on the Iraqi side of the battle lines. As I watched, I kept wondering when we would eventually get to certain pivotal events that were of great interest to me and I suspect to many others, and guess what? We never did. Ultimately House of Saddam committed the cardinal sin of storytelling: it got boring."
3,Well-Acted but Somewhat Draggy,"Based on Disc 1, this is a well-acted but somewhat draggy account of the Saddam years replete with megalomania, pointless assassinations, family intrigues, paranoia and war. Sort of an historical soap opera. Yet, the photography is generally lush and convincing. It will appeal primarily to historians and those with an interest in modern Middle Eastern history. Unfortunately the actor who plays Saddam kept reminding me of an overweight and mustachioed Jeffrey Tambor."
5,"Very, very good mini series",I watched this on Hbo and was blown away by the performances. I very well made movie based on Saddam Hussain
3,Insightful,The movie gave a close view of the inner working of Saddam Hussein' inner circle. It was interesting to see the ruthlessness going on in that micro group.
2,I wouldn't read it twice,"Pretty superficial book, its principal content could be condensed into 30% of the original volume. One worrying finding: the author is extremely careless for a scientist in his interpretation of inheritance of IQ and the work of Sir Cyril Burt. It is reasonably clear now that the vicious attack on Burt was politically motivated. Provided that very substantial inheritance of IQ is now beyond technical dispute, author's undocumented blatant denial is of not much worth. My concern that when I see such an apparent flaw in argument on the topic of my knowledge, it raises unnecessary doubts about the book as a whole. Hopefully, such attitude is only a formal pledge of allegiance to ""anti-racist"" dogs who currently control the MSM."
1,read-and smell- before you buy,"as far as blood types go he is a waste of money. the only good survey in his book is the one that says native americans have a population of 98 percent blood type 'o'. apart from this figure he groups blood types not on racial characteristics but on continent. logically the remaining blood statistics are inconclusive. he has a little information on blood types and languages and dna, but it's all been geared to correspond to his ""Outstanding"" theories. as far as honesty goes i seriously doubt all people who claim to be able to understand other languages merely by their own one. eg. an italian claiming to understand portugese and spainsh merely by knowing italian, or someone claiming to be able to read greek from knowing cyrillic. this overpriced book wouldn't be worth a review, only most of the other reviews praise it. another thing is the ink and paper print quality. if you get a whiff of this book's smelly pages, that may be enough to dissuade you from buying."
5,"Enthralling, erudite and witty","A correction needs to made to another customer's review. Herold was NOT British; he was American. Moreover, the book is NOT Anglocentric (that, I suspect, is more a hobby horse of that particular customer). And the book does NOT fail to commend the French, the Egyptians -- anyone -- when they deserve it. Herold was manifestly a humanist. Which is why he applies a caustic blowtorch to all those who war, pillage, extort and rape on flimsy pretexts.If only all histories were this comprehensive, superbly written and sharply observed."
4,Excellent offering,"I've been a The The fan since the start (well, 1983). This album has all the marks of vintage Matt Johnson but with a stripped-down sound, more akin to Dusk and Soul Mining than Infected or Mind Bomb. Some truly great tracks (ShrunkenMan, SoulCatcher) but some overly raucous numbers that dropped it down one star from perfection, in my view. Still, an excellent record."
4,Another chapter from the tormented mind of Matt Johnson,"NakedSelf is not as listenable as Dusk. It reminds me more of Mind Bomb to the extent it's a lot more aggressive. Nothing wrong with aggressive, but Dusk is much more listenable as a whole. I agree with the comment Matt Johnson is one of the greatest songwriters around, and there are a few highlights on this CD: SoulCatcher, GlobalEyes and December Sunlight."
4,Back with a vengeance,"The The, largely a product of Matt Johnson's gritty imagination, is back with a new album for the new millenium, and it shows that it is not get going to get any better just because the years start with twos... NakedSelf is angrier than the last album, Hanky Panky (a superb collection of Hank William tunes), almost as if Matt is returning to his roots. There is more guitar, and the sound is harder, not such a surprise since The The is now on Nothing Records, Trent Reznor's record label. A surprising exception is PhantomWalls, an almost optomistic ode to pain and the lesson's learned from it. ""Pain can be your friend.""Indeed."
3,Matt Johnson continues his lonely crusade,"As a long standing fan, i awaited this release with a mixture of anticipation and trepidation, all too aware of the black hole of mediocrity that many artists past their prime tumble into.Happily, its not the case with Naked Self...to a point. While Matt Johnson retains his penchant for sharing personal life lessons learned(see the record title for a huge hint), I felt the record did lose something from the subtle genius of Dusk. Credit him for moving in new directions, but i have to admit i miss the unmistakeable contributions of a certain johnny marr, who in many ways seemed the perfect foil for johnson's angst ridden offerings.welcome back."
5,Different,"A great album. After a few listens, it really comes together as a CD. VERY different than some of his other stuff, but his voice comes through audibly (and lyrcially)."
3,"Naked Self - Strong, but not his best","The latest offering from The The is a decent album, but is not as strong as his earlier releases. As an introduction to The The I recommend Mind Bomb or Infected as I think convey better the musical strengths and diversity of The The."
4,Stravinsky's Firebird with weak bass drum,"Interpretation wise, this Firebird is excellent. Craft gives a wonderful reading of this piece and it's nice to hear the complete version.The recording is also excellent with a nice open sound.My only caveat (and it is in my opinion a big one) is the lack of a deep ground shaking bass drum. Sure, the bass drum is there but it just never grabs you as it does on Telarc's older recording with Robert Shaw and the Atlanta symphony."
4,Interesting Wall Art,"This crossword puzzle will certainly keep you busy for quite some time. Lots of unique clues that range in difficulty level, and an easy to reference answer booklet make this puzzle seem slightly less than impossible to finish.A bit difficult to hang up -- the puzzle comes in several large sheets which you have to tape together and align.The geometric pattern of the puzzle looks great from a distance, but just make sure you have a large enough wall to hang it on -- it's a bit overwhelming close up."
1,Waste of Money; They Don't Work,"Put these things out with close attention to following the instructions and after six days, more mice droppings and no captured mice. Worse off, they seemed to attract the mice (due to the peanut butter bait we used) but the mice simply chewed through the top to eat the bait last night. This morning, all the bait was gone, the tops were all chewed through, and we had more mice droppings than ever before. We're going to the store to buy traditional mouse traps."
1,Not effective at all,"I put one out with peanut butter & another out with cheese. Got nothing for a week. Tried d-CON's Ultra Set Covered Mouse Trap instead & had 3 dead mice in 2 nights. Great concept, but horrible results."
2,"Complex, expensive, not sure it even works","I bought two of the no-view, no-touch, at the same time I bought two ""regular"" mouse traps. One of the no-view, no-touch traps was loaded, set and deployed; it is still untouched. I need more regular mouse traps to replace the two that were set and tripped resulting in one dead mouse, and one dead rat."
1,"Terrible, mice can't even get in when they want to!","I was forced to buy these as the other kind I was looking for that were working were out of stock, got these in the meantime. The mice don't seem to be able to find the entrance, and it seems they tried! as the stickers on the outside were all chewed up like they were trying to get at the peanut butter inside! to small and twisted of an entrance it seems, I had used the Ortho ones that were white and narrow but had a good size opening and all they had to do was walk straight in, 2 in 2 days, these? nadda."
3,"Great idea, but need bigger ones.",Would probably be better if I tried to use bigger ones (are there bigger ones). At least it doesn't hurt the cats and dogs if left out.
1,"No View, No Touch, No Catch Mouse Traps","Don't get these, they are a complete waste of money.These traps sat empty for a week. I was not convinced that the mouse I caught a glimpse of had just vanished so we got some of the traditional traps.Within 2 hours we had 2 dead mice. I am beyond grossed out, but at least they are dead and not roaming around- no thanks to the No View, No Touch traps."
1,D-Con traps no mice,"I was excited when I found the D-Con No view, No Touch Mouse Trap because I live alone and there's no way that I could handle a traditional trap. I'd probably pass out at the sight of a dead mouse. So I bought a dozen of these wonderful traps and set them out, baited, as instructed, with peanut butter, some with cheese. As of this day, I have not caught a single mouse. Somebody screwed up with this one and it was probably me for buying it in the first place. Remember, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is."
1,Save Your Money!,"If you are thinking about buying the newer traps by D-Con----DON'T! When used precisely as directed, the rats outsmart the traps by turning the lightweight plastic trap over and chewing through the paper label where the food is stored in the food compartment of the trap. It was not a smart design. ""No View, No Touch"" is about as good as it gets. One would think turning the mouse trap clockwise as directed would place a hard surface under the food department to prevent rats by-passing the mouse's entrance. Save your money and use a bait or hire a professional. Either way, it is better than simply walking into a retailer and forking over almost $6 for a poorly designed invention that doesn't work."
5,"Tamara, ""Gracias""","Absolutely marvelous -- we hear it over and over. I have bought two of these, one as a gift. She has a magnificent voice, so romantic."
4,MUSIC THAT MOVES YOU,"I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS YOUNG IN THE 60'S, MY MOM HAD THIS RED VINYL ALBUM CALLED ""MAMBO WITH TJADER."" I THOUGHT IT WAS AWESOME THEN AND PRESENTLY, I HAVE REDISCOVERED TJADER AND HIS MUSIC. IT SOUNDS AS COOL NOW AS IT DID THEN. RELAX ,ENJOY!!!!!!"
3,Almost Like Being in Love,"Almost Like Being in Love: As the others, very muich formula, but good escape literature--easy to read. Take this on a plane or vacation trip."
2,Major Disappointment,"I usually enjoy Christina Dodd (especially her monthly newsletters), but I was very disappointed (and bored) with this book. I liked ""Just the Way You Are"" a lot and couldn't wait to read the next one in the series. While I usually read a book every two days, this one took two WEEKS, and that was with trying to skip past the pages and pages and pages of overdone sexual fantasies (and finally experiences). Way too much sex; it got to be sickening. Had a hard time forcing myself to pick up the book.Unlike some of the reviews I've read, I did like the plot (for the most part), but it took too long to unfold... WAY too long. I've already ordered Book # 3 in the series, so I hope Miss Dodd redeems herself by then."
3,Skip it and read Close to You!,I read Close to you and loved it! so I decided to go backwards and read the other two prescott sisters stories. I never should have bothered. The interesting characters and well thought out plot line found in Tonue in chic was glaringly missing in this book. The herione was so incredibly irritating that it was completely hard to believe that hero really wanted to be with her...I mean really. I did the speed read version of this book. Sighing in relief when it was over. Too bad there is not a satisfaction guarantee on some of these books. $7 is a lot to waste on nonsense like this one. Skip the first two prescott books...go straight to Close to you and read Christina Dodd from there. It is obvious her writing has greatly improved over the years. Her new stuff is great.
4,Couldn't put this book down,"The strong character of Pepper and her tragic story had me from the first page. This book has a very seductive cover but the story line, although it contains some romance is so much more. It is about family relationships and some military schemes are incorporated as well. This is the first book I read by this author, and I really enjoyed it."
3,Average,"This movie was decent, but it doesn't have much of a re-watch value. You can tell when you watch it that it was done very low budget, so you have to like small, low budget films to enjoy it. Many of the jokes seemed forced, and were mostly there to show what an awful person the lead character is. As a result, the viewer finds it difficult to identify with the lead character. The lead character could have been like Barney on How I Met Your Mother where you hate him for what he does, but you like him because he is funny. Instead, I found myself comparing the lead character to ""The Todd"" from Scrubs where you cringe every time he opens his mouth, and find it unbelievable that any woman would ever talk to him. All in all, I would say that this movie is average. It is not bad, but it is not really good either. It would be a forgettable movie if an eating disorder was not one of the main plot points, but as it stands that was really the only memorable part of the film."
3,Didn't see nudity,"I didn't watch the whole thing from start to finish, I kind of scanned through it. I didn't see any nudity when I scanned it. There were a couple of bra and panty shots...It was a very funny plot from what I saw, that's what made it worth watching."
3,Nice texture but doesn't show up dark enough for me.,"This blush looks quite a bit deeper in the compact than it does on skin. It goes on smoothly, but just more like a makeup than a blush on my pale skin. I'd recommend this brand, but would suggest anyone purchasing it to buy a shade darker than whichever one appears ""right"" by sight."
4,Lasts long,"I bought this at my drugstore, but it's too dark for me; i'm ivory 01 year round (I wasn't paying attention when I was buying it). But apart from that, i love it and it lasts me all day. Perfect for guard competitions!"
3,It's ok..,"When I first started using this stuff, I wasn't sure if I liked it. I have VERY dry skin & this stuff isn't moisturizing at all. I do like how it looks, & how long it lasts, but it definitely is hard to remove & apply if you don't moisturize & use a primer before. I stopped using this because it seemed to be breaking me out.. but I do have very sensitive, acne prone skin. I noticed breakouts after using it just about every day but then noticed after I discontinued that it was probably because of how dry my skin is & so I only use this on days I KNOW I'll be outside in the heat for a long period of time. I can't say i Love this stuff but I do like it. It has nice coverage, it's buildable but definitely more for those on the combination/oily side. I wouldn't recommend for dry skin!! This would honestly be perfect if it weren't so hard to apply, it dries too quickly!"
5,Love this makeup!,Great makeup for my nearly 50 year old skin. The pump is a nice feature because I don't contaminate the bottle with germs from my fingers or makeup sponges.
4,get things straight,"For everyone's info...This is a re-release of the original ""Best of Cream"" which was released in either in 1969 or 1970. The original cover art was white with artwork of various kinds of vegatables on the front...The current photo on the cover of the re-release was the back cover photo of the original...The song list remains intact!"
4,"Use as a ""Sampler"" CD","Cream is a good band. Their career was all too short, yet they created some of the best music. Like other 20th Century Masters collections, this one is short, and is missing quite a few hit songs. However, every song on here is good, and each album is represented. ""I Feel Free"" and ""Spoonful"" are my favorite tracks. So here is what I recommend: if you are just getting into Cream, let this be your first CD. If you like what you hear, dig deeper later. If you are already a huge Cream fan, skip this one, for there are better Cream compilations out there."
1,"Dittos to other negative reviews, and one additional comment","In short, believe all the comments in the other reviews giving this CD a negative review, and be advised of at least one additional ""ugly"" trait of this CD:The first song (""I Feel Free"") is EDITED, and does not contain the complete track. Quite a dirty trick, don't you think ?STAY AWAY from any of the ""20th Century Masters"" CDs. Buy from a reputable label."
3,Class Trip,"Nicholas is an insecure child plagued by visions of disasters and horrible accidents. In his dreams he sees his father in a car crash, his brother is abducted and his own classmates are shot by men in white masks. His peers tease him and his teachers are frustrated by his lack of social skills. Nicolas disconnects from the world around him, inhabiting his own friendless, nightmarish realm. On a class trip to the ski country, the class bully befriends him and becomes intrigued by his dreams. As the line between reality and hallucination blurs, Nicolas?s visions begin to come true. When police find a dead child in the woods, murdered and mutilated, Nicolas knows there is a connection between this crime and his visions, and with his friend?s help he sets out to fine it. There is no nudity in this movie."
4,EXTRA HEAVY AND DOUBLE IRIE!,"This album is a total gem from Scratch. The way Soundsz was put together is how a dub album is meant to be. The beats are fierce, the lyrics are strong, and the album holds itself together perfectly (unlike some of the throw-togethers the record cos. release). You'll love this one."
4,Timeless Clancy Eccles,"Clancy Eccles-one of the premier producers in Jamaican music presents his showcase of numerous talent. Eccles was a producer who was ahead of his time. This album presents very rare grooves and rare artists whose time has come. You can listen to this album over and over and become entranced with the melodies and rich harmonies so prevalent in early rock steady music. Standout cuts: Please Stay-Larry Marshall, Wanderer-Beres Hammond, Love Brother Love-Hugh Malcolm...really the whole album is the bomb!!!"
5,xcellent album!,"this is definitely a must buy album because it features tracks like disco nights and heaven must be an angel, ymca and all the other great classic tunes.... where i come from - Malaysia!!! (not known to the world then)were already hits in our local discotheques (some 20 years ago). burning the dancefloors almost nightly. back then it was only available on vinyl's. so i guess most people who are having all the hits or even singles on this album could be on vinyl format,right? most people would still stick to their old vinyls, but hey... having this collection on CD won't harm right?? at least the clarity is there and more durable. most of us in that era would wish a compilation of this sort to be out in the market one day. well..your prayers are answered. since it's out... what are you waiting for... don't regret later as there might never be another compilation as great as this ever !!!one comment from me is that it would be great if it was release as a 12""singles compilation."
4,this is the tune you can dance if you are a great dancer,"The price of the Cd is very cheap and could add up a little bit.now the good part of the favorite popular songs are here: ""DISCO INFERNO"" by the tramps, ""GOOD TIMES"" by chic, ""FUNKYTOWN"" by lipps, ""YMCA"" by the village people, 'BOOGIE OOGIE"" by the taste of honey, buy this cd its a good investment. bye now"
2,A Few Good Songs!,"This CD is so-so, the only really good disco songs are Disco Inferno, Funky Town, and Rock The Boat. Y.M.C.A, and It's Raining Men are ok but kind of hokey, and the rest of the songs are hideous! I guess you have to be a major disco fan to totally like this CD, and I'm not a major fan as I only like a few disco songs! All of the disco songs I like are on the Pure Disco CD's and though there are songs on the Pure Disco Vol.1 and Vol.2 CD's's that I don't like there are also a lot that I do like and I just prefer those CD's to this one so I would rate them a 3 and this CD a 2."
1,REALLY BAD,"I had to listen to this cd 3 times over,and i don't wish that upon anybody ever.But the worst songs on here are KC and the sunshine band's ""Getdown Tonight""and ""Disco Inferno"".All of the Legion people liked it,but i didn't."
1,More of a Rental Video,"It's just him showing off and talking about himself, not very useful or worth your money. Perhaps something you watch once and then put aside."
5,Amazing story!,This was an amazing story that made me laugh and cry. It is very honest about the ups and downs of foster parenting.
2,"Odd book, but interesting in retrospect","This is a difficult, convoluted read... but it is more fascinating to read at this point, with Muktananda having been exposed as a false guru, to better see the development of and maintenance of the guru image, and how devotion can become a cult.The inability of SYDA members to separate themselves from the unethical processes of this cult, even after Muktananda was revealed, has its root in the teachings as presented here. You can really see the motivations and methods employed from the very beginning. Truly fascinating in that respect.A true guru will never create dependence in a student. That's the best guide to tell true from false. It is however very interesting to read this autobiography with active hindsight."
2,Boring. Not his best.,"I love Gil Evans, but found this album to be dreadfully boring.I must be in the minority, because this is a very highly rated album.After playing it once, I'm looking for someone to give the CD to."
1,WHERE IS IT?,"Ordered it back in October about first few weeks in the month, was supposed to arrive by October 27th and it is now.... November 27th. Still not here"
3,Horse Backstreet Choppers,I would reccomend this magazine to those who ride motorclyces. I do not read the magazine as I have not read it. The magazine is for my son and he seems to like it.
3,"Very Comfortable, Not Built to Last....","This bra is very comfortable. It looks good under t-shirts. If you hate underwire, this is a god choice. The only drawback.... It doesn't hold up well in the wash."
2,This is a bootleg!!!,I bought this cd by mistake thinking it was a compliation of B-side tracks.Its actully just a bootleg with horrible sound quality in disguise! however it does have a charm to it I suppose.
4,Love,"When Dr. Schuller was dealing with his daughter Carol's tragedy, he received a note and photograph addressed to her from the Duke himself, John Wayne. It simply was inscribed ""Be Happy! You are Loved.""Love without faith is not love at all and that is what Dr. Schuller reiterates. With anecdotal stories and catchy phrases this man of possibility gives anyone the ideas needed to overcome any barriers.Be Happy You Are Loved is a powerful book that gives us hope.Love without faith- is impossible and faith without love is unacceptable."
4,Good but....,"I loved the design of these earrings. Turquoise being my favourite gemstone, the earrings were not a flawless blue. Ofcourse, maybe it is untreated turquoise. But they were a kind of blue with brown spots. If it were a good blue as shown in the photo, it would have been a great pair...."
1,"Bad, outdated history","Jared Sparks, long dead, was a big gun at Harvard in the early 19th Century. His biographies are prime examples of the bowdlerization of history, cleaned up and skewed to fit the popular prejudices of their time. In particular, Sparks demonized Arnold, epitomizing Shakespeare's line, ""The evil that men do lives on after them; the good is oft interred with their bones."" This book is useful only as an example of the kind of biased history that it took to manufacture a national patriotic mythology for an infant nation nearly two centuries ago."
3,BIG CHIEFA,this is one of the best chief songs i have ever heard. buy this and u wont be disapointted
1,Inaccurate and Out of Date,"Though this series embodies a clever concept, both the current edition (the 7th) and the previous one contain many inaccuracies, especially the inclusion of places that have changed dramatically or that are simply no longer there. While the format is convenient for having at hand while walking around the city, I cannot recommend using this book for planning. Moreover, the concept and presentation around which this series is based has been significantly improved upon by the DK-Publishing Eyewitness Travel Guides series.If you intend to walk around London and want an accurate guide that orients you and points out the essential and interesting sites, the Eyewitness Travel Guides series is a much better bet. If you are really looking for a street-by-street, house-by-house listing of everything there is, the Access series is useful--but be sure to check everything that matters to you with another source before departing to make sure it really is there!"
3,Not as good as past Access.,"Received it later than I expected. Was not as good as earlier London Access that I had purchased about 19 years ago. Did not think it was under the listing of ""progress"". But will use it and was happy with the price. Would not have paid full value for it in a bookstore!"
4,Great Platform Sandals!,Vert comfy - but I would suggest a half size to full size larger if you are not fimilliar with such bodacious heels - they make your legs look KILLER!
4,Good Fast Read ... Maybe a little simplistic,"Interesing, well written with a good plot. It was a very fast read. My criticism is that some of the plots and ""facts"" are simplistic. For example one of the protagonists who is in charge of schooling the population argues that extreme intelligence is abnormal. Her arguement is written ""...Being able to play Chopin is abnormal, as is being able paint like DaVince..."" Now I don't know of many people who would present an arguement in such a black and white simplistic (and antagonising) way. There were many examples of goofy plots and cheesy characters. But it was entertaining reading!"
3,A pleasant hour with Shemp,"A thoughtful programmer has packaged three situation comedies, in which the Stooges tackle various projects with no success whatever. GENTS IN A JAM has the team cleaning house before a rich relative's visit. A SNITCH IN TIME has the Stooges as inept woodworkers (there's some funny dialogue in this). GOOF ON THE ROOF is the broadest of the three shorts, with the Stooges trying to install a TV antenna. None of these are mentioned when ""classic"" Three Stooges comedies are discussed, but they are fast and funny examples of the Stooges' early-1950s work."
1,"""The Big Bopper"" isn't as big as the titles claim!","My two most-desired titles on this album were ""Chantilly Lace"" and ""Little Red Riding Hood"". I was(am) extremely disappointed that ""Little Red..."" was missing, though listed."
5,They deserve the Emmy nominations,Great show!! So glad the actors were nominated for Emmy awards. Hope they all win because their work was amazing.
4,Good impression of the period,"I bought the book to get an impression of the period, instead of only pictures of dresses in patternbooks. This book shows also ways to weare your hair and matching hads etc."
5,A GREAT RESOURCE!!!,"I bought this book for my teenage daughter who is very interested in historic fashions. This book is wonderful as it is arranged chronically and illustrates the shift in 'fashions' from 1860 to 1914. The pictures are beautiful and very well done, and easy to see the detail of the dresses, swimming outfits, riding habits etc..The only drawback to this book is that it gives you so many ideas, it is hard to decide what to sew next. I would recommend this book to all re-enactors of this historic time frame."
5,Outstanding Merchandise!,I love these caligraphy markers and was happy to find them again. Same good quality as always!
2,Disappointing,"Being sharpies, I expected a smoother and more accurate marker than these. The tip is really hard, and in two of the five markers it had imperfections that made the trace look shabby. It was really hard to get any nice work done with them. In the end I had to go back to the calligraphy pen to make my wedding signs, because these markers were practically useless."
2,kind of disappointed....damaged product,"One of the 5 markers was damaged...box was damaged... the Sharpie Marker itself, too large to do Calligraphy with...the ink bleeds out and ruins the words..."
1,"Warped in no time, spend more for better","Bought this for a neighbors truck. I would not ordinarily purchase this brand, however it was all they offered at the time shipped in the timeframe we were looking at. To keep this short, warped in no time. 2 days tops. Removed and used another better know brand, no issues in the 2 months since. You know what they say about getting what you pay for ? In this case, it applies. The primary issue with this drum is that it is too thin. OEM and other makes are far thicker and heavier."
1,Horrible - Not concentric to bolt holes.,"I got these drums based on a recommendation. When I installed them and took a test drive, i found the drums were not concentric to the bolt holes and the pad surface was causing the car to surge when i applied the breaks. I may have got a bunk set, but my first experience from these guys was not good so I wont be buying from them again."
3,Easy to use with practice...but noisy,"I basically like the features of the product, and after a bit of use it is pretty easy to use. I really do love the convenience of using rewritable discs on this. A few notes: It is noisy, I am not sure why. There is an electrical hum all the time, it is quite apparent. I almost sent it back thinking it was broken but I noticed other reviewers on other sites say the same thing. The other reason I only gave it a 3 *s is because--as of yet--I cannot figure out how to set a timer recording for the VHS portion of the machine. I don't think it is possible, so that was a bit of shock."
3,sizing not accurate,"Youth Pink Cowboy BootI purchased this boot for my 9 year old daughter who wears a childrens size 4.5. Youth size 4.5 is actually a woman's size 6.5. This was not clear on the sizing charts supplied. The boot skipped from a children's size 3 to youth size 4. Sizing needs to be explained more thoroughly. I thought the boot was overpriced also....it wasn't leather. My daughter was happy, however, and wore the boots for Halloween even though they were too big."
4,red boots,They were wider than I had expected. Usually children's sizes run more narrow and these ran much wider. I needed to wear two socks and they were hard to break in.
5,gift,super cute books. They came quickly and are of good quality. I am pleased with the boots for a 2yr old girl.
3,Color is off,"These boots are not true red. They have a bit of dark brick or maroon tinge to them. I was disappointed in the color but my daughter did not notice. They seem comfortable and sturdy, although after just a few weeks there are a few spots where the color has flaked off, but I'm not surprised because they are being worn hard and often."
3,Disappointed,"I am pleased with the content on the cd, the singing is wonderful, but I can't believe the amount of background noise. It's very distracting. Didn't someone tell these folks not to make noise? I would have demanded a retake or remixing to eliminate the clanging and banging in the background. It's disrespectful to the subject matter in the songs."
5,Stomp (whole et),"I just love this cd, the music is very unique and enjoyable and I really love to dance to Stomp that is my favorite and all my friends love it!"
1,PLEASE RELEASE,I ORDERED THIS ON 11 FEB 00. IT WAS SUSPOSE TO BE RELEASED ON THE 22 FEB 00. TODAY IS THE 26 FEB 00?
2,Older Knobs,These knobs are for models prior to 1996. I have 2005 awning and they will not work. Make sure you check when your awning was made before ordering.
2,bad recording,"This is not what I expected, my favorite song on this CD is ""after the loving"", which is song in a faster and different tempo,than the original. I should have sent it back."
4,Fantastic language source book,This translation of Lazard 1957 which was printed in Paris could be used as a fantastic source of linguistic inquiries on Persian grammar. Lazard has given precise notions on contemporary Persian grammar. It is a kind of scholary book and may not be used as a training course in Farsi. Those who research on Persian grammar should apply for it.
4,Great for painting crafts!!,"This is great for painting ceramics and such. I like it for the small points of a project that require extra care. It lights up nicely. I wish the stand was a little taller, but it does work great!!"
3,Delivery Time,"Book was in good condition, but took 17 days to be delivered. I ordered 8 other books at the same time, from 5 different sellers and received all of the other books within 7 days."
1,OVERPRICED IDIOCY,"Simply put...Rawhide is a classic but the price is sheer ""overpriced idiocy/insanity""...ridiculous - $72.00 (volumes 1 and 2) for what should be half that.The majority of consumers can see through the B.S. (and if they have aniota of common sense won't take the bait) Consumer/market demand (for complete seasons) and the fact every thing on DVD is being released and re-released as collector's edition, deluxe edition, platinum edition etc., exemplifies yet another example of studios gone amuck and craftfully ""raking it in,"" from those falling for the marketing scheme. It is only a matter of time (and sooner rather than later) that the complete seasons of what is now being released in ""volume 1 and volume 2 nonsense"" will be ""it.""...Most seasons of television series available on the market are released as complete seasons, and participating studios in the multi-volume idiocy will backfire (cash register won't ring)Listening Paramount?...Time to wake up...big time."
2,No More Split Seasons Volumes,"Can you imagine watching a TV series on television, and having to wait about 6 months or more to view the second half of the season, totally absurd. The content of the Rawhide series is super and highly recommended.What I object strongly too, is the way this media is being marketed,be it Rawhide,Perry Mason, etc. I paid $35 new for season one of Rawhide and $62 for season two. No longer, will I purchase any seasons' volume sets, because of the annoyance of waiting for Volume 2 & the lack of value, while avoiding to feed the Hand of Greed and Stupidity."
1,"Rawhide-season 2, vol 1 & 2","The cover shows CC caption, but there are no CC in English. I did not like this and returned the video."
5,best sandpaper probably available for sanding clear coat,i used this to sand my clear coat to get ready for primer for my car. it works awesome when using it as wet sandpaper. i probably could have done the whole car with just 1/3 of a sheet but i wanted to get it good so i used just 2/3 of one sheet to do my whole car. it worked great and didn't get too clogged or anything. best stuff available probably. go out and get this if you need to sand your car for paint. great stuff i can't say it enough!
5,Remembering Times of Long Ago.,"I was deeply touched by Ms. Adair's ability to share the history of her family in a way that recaptured days of my own youth and the joys I experienced with my family. Her story can be my story and the story of so many people. I cried at the sadness of the family leaving home for an unfamiliar place and the circumstance that lead to the move. I laughed at the sibling rivalry and I found myself smiling because it bought back so many childhood memories. I was reminded of how much fun it is to have a large family, even in the hard times. Wind Chimes and Promises was a joy from cover to cover. It brimes with family love and devotion; excitement as well as momemts of tenderness. It was the kind of reading that you couldn't stop until you were finished, and it left you wishing for more. I recommend it as a must read. I hope this will not be the last we hear from Ms. Adair, she is a gifted writer."
3,FROM THE VAULTS,"These tracks recorded in 1957 for Prestige records were not released until 1964. What's New and Strange Blues are the best of them. They were recorded as part of that marathon quartet session Jack did with Mal Waldron 2/57. Strange Blues was the only blues from that session but did not appear on LP for a while. The other tunes come from a 7/57 unfinished sextet session,with trumpet and tuba in the front line. The brass players lay out as Jack plays- Not So Strange Blues, but it's not nearly as good as Strange Blues. Later in the year Jack brought in a whole new rhythm section and recorded this sextet for Jubilee records, repeating Millie's Pad."
2,Awning De-Flapper,"Thought these things would be helpful and to some extent they are. But, we are an older couple and the de-flappers need a lot of strength to hold tight otherwise they loose control in the wind. Hard to put on too."
5,Revewing the revew...,"I think it's a revew on the revew you've got there, as it shows a little misunderstanding of Max Weber plan. He wills not to turn Marx upside-down, therefore falling into some kind of idealism, but instead, he trys to complicate Marx thesis, in the way he understands it, sayng that causality is much wider than materialistic, and ideas can have ""elective afinities"" with interests. Both authors do not exclude each other, but can be used to criticise one anohter."
4,A Sociology Classic,"Modern readers may find the dry style this book is written in a bit boring, but the subject matter makes up for it. Weber looks at 4 branches of Protestantism (Calvinism, Pietism, Methodists, Baptists) and how they each affected the development of modern capitalism. It also sheds light on some of the origins of modern Western beliefs."
2,Wrong Version of Book,"The book was in the described condition and it came on time, etc. However, the book was the wrong version, which made it extremely difficult to follow along in class."
3,"Just the facts, Max","I was impressed with Weber's point about capitalism being an offshoot of Calvinist's trying to please God through hard work, but this is a long and tough read for the layman."
4,slight typo...,"I meant Heinrich Rickert, not Richter. Weber was a sociologist (among other things), not a seismologist."
1,Awful version! Go with a real publisher,"This version ofThe Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism(with stacks of $100 bills on the cover) is one to avoid. As the reviewers from October 7, 2011 and October 15, 2011 have noted, there are many problems with this edition. First, and most severe, is that the end note superscripts are full sized. This means that every line with an end note has extra space above it, which throws off all of the spacing on the page. It looks terrible! How could anyone possibly have published this book? Second, there isn't a publisher listed. No city, no year, no company. Further, there is a notice that ""No part of this book may be reproduced... "" etc. However, this text is in the public domain, so that statement is false. Copy/reproduce whatever you want. There's no copyright. This looks like a self-published book that was copied from the online HTML version and passed off as a quality publishing. Avoid it. Get another version."
1,Didnt Even Use It,"I am not sure it this is what they advertised, but this book was a knock off copy of the actual book and you could not refer to the proper pages and was just wierd. I did not even use this book and threw it away..."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THEM,I NEVER EVEN RECEIVED THE BOOK!! IT NEVER CAME AND NOW I HAVE NO WAY TO READ IT FOR MY COLLEGE CLASS... >:s
5,Remarkably comfortable chair.,This chair is made for sitting. The slope of the ottoman is designed for leg comfort. The fact that it's moveable means it can be used by short or long legs. The chairs lumbar support is in the right place for any back and it's solid. The head rest can be adjusted with a moveable pillow. The arm rests are close enough to the body so your arms don't slide down between the arm and your body. It swivels and reclines. What more could you ask of a chair. I purchased this item (Mac Motion Recliner with Ottoman) from Amazon. From ordering through delivery I was amazed at the thorough way everything was handled. I would also add that the assembly of the chair was not that difficult.
2,Excessive Use of Commas Compete with Redundant Content,"Have managed to get through 3 chapters; repetititous material competes with his over & misuse of commas to the point of distraction. Good material, yet seems base level. Dry, lacking emotion. Cannot verify psychology licensure in NY state license database."
5,Excellent book,"This book among others is one of the best in helping me with the grieving process. An easy read, it has helped me deal with my feelings of guilt while reassuring me that I did the right thing in letting my precious pet go. I only had 5 days to make the decision to allow my pet to be put out of his suffering. The pain is very real and will take me a lot of time to heal. This book vadidates my feelings in a tender way. Highly recommended."
5,Support at your fingertips.,"""The Loss Of A Pet"", third edition, is the most comprehensive book on pet loss and bereavement that I have read - and there have been many. Dr. Sife's keen insight into the emotions that surface after pet loss is illustrated in the pages of this book, and somewhere in each chapter you feel as if he were talking directly to you. He thoroughly explains the stages of grief that we go through, and helps us understand why we feel as we do going through them. It is easier to process our grief when we understand that we are normal in every strange feeling that comes over us, and that those feelings are temporary, and that we are not alone in our terrible pain. The human/animal bond is unique, as is the bereavement. This book also illustrates how deep a love can be between a human and a beloved animal companion, and because of the pure relationship that is shared every day, the loss can be much more painful than losing a human loved one. I highly recommend this book."
2,Too clinical; not enough heart,"Having recently lost a dog of my own, several people suggested reading Dr. Sife's book. I wish I could say it helped, but the approach is far too clinical and distant. This reads like a standard psychology textbook. More examples and case studies would have helped the author make his points. He does sound sincere, but way too detached for me. I found ""Goodbye Friend"" to be a much better book."
5,Loss of a Pet Review,"The best book for pet loss, I couldnt seem to get out from a heavy depression with grief and this book explained my relaionship with my cat Kira to a T I couldnt understand so many things but after reading this Im doing much better, I would tell anyone who is grieving to get the book,"
1,Disappointing....,"I have read many, many books on pet bereavement and loss and I have to say that I'm a little disappointed with Mr. Sife's book. It reads like a monotonous textbook and lacks feeling. I've read other pet bereavement books where warmth and understanding are felt, right from page one, but this book is not like that. There are other pet bereavement books out there that are much more helpful."
2,Not What I Was Needing,"After the death of our beloved dog-child Ruffy, this was the only book on pet grief I could find at my bookstore. My heart was, and still is,bleeding and I took it home and devoured it in a matter of days. It is written more to those who counsel the grieving in my opinion and did not minister to my pain. It is too technical and black and white. I felt it left out heartfelt emotion and soul. I am still searching for a book to touch my heart."
5,A Good Source of Help,"There are many books on what I term ""grief relief"", which take the reader through the many stages or phases of grief. I have never reviewed any that were not good, but Wallace's book is a very good book that I can recommend. Having talked with Wallace on several occasions years ago on his philosophy of healing, I can attest to the fact that he cares about people and that his work reflects that. You have only to read the reviews of those who needed his help to see they received it. This book is a good source of help."
4,Emotional...,"This book is soothing and contains many kind, caring chapters. My cat, which I had for almost 14 years, died suddenly 3 months ago.I found the book helpful but I can't read it w/out being reduced to crying, emotional mess."
4,It help's,I ordered this book the day after my two dogs were euthanized for some extra support. It is very informative and helpful. I think it would even help deal with the grief of a human relative or friend aswell. I would suggest it to someone in grief with a pet definately.
1,"Definitely not what I needed, either...","This guy is so cold, clinical and at times even takes on a judgmental tone; I couldn't even finish the book. I just lost my beloved pit bull mix to osteosarcoma and after reading in this book for the third time the implication that people who get too emotionally attached to their pets are somehow less than mentally healthy, it was just too much to take. I happen to love my pets. More than a lot of humans I know. Pets don't judge, they are always there for you and never let you down. So I'm crazy because of this? Or less than what the author deems 'normal'?? That's a ridiculous assumption. Don't buy the book, unless you're a cold fish and only want the clinical, judgmental side...a far superior book for the grief-stricken is ""Goodbye, friend"" by Gary Kowalski."
1,A very disappointing book on a sensitive subject,"I was extremely disappointed in the treatment of pet loss bereavement in this book. Among other things, the author suggests that there is a specified ""appropriate"" mouring period after the loss of a pet. He seems incredibly judgmental of anyone who isn't ""over it"" in 3 weeks' time. This is a major turn-off.In addition, I found the book full of insincere platitudes. The author's biases are more than apparent, yet he does not own them as personal opinion or perspective; he presents everything he writes as ""truth."" Personally, I am leary of authors who do this. In spite of that, I read the whole book, and was disappointed at my own misjudgment, at having wasted me time."
5,Finally !!!,"Glad The Mod Squad has gotten it's long overdue DVD release. I wont complain about the 1st Season being split into two releases.{the 2nd half of Season 1 has already been announced for March '08}We all know it's ""the Man"" stickin' it to Us !!!! I'm just glad it's here ! Tried as I might, I could not find anywhere on line about the ""pilot"", ""Teeth of the Barracuda"" Originally it aired in a 90min slot {with the episode running approx 73 mins} Then trimmed for syndication to air in a 60min slot. But, good news...It is the full 73 min episode on the set. It doesn't even denote it on the box.It's great having this show on DVD."
4,Cool show,"Even after all these years, this show is still fun to watch. I remember when I was a kid and it was in prime time so Im showing my age here.I've only watched disc 1 and 2 at this writing, but the transfers are well done and the color appears to have been restored, so I am very pleased with this set.I would have given five stars, but my complaint lies in the packaging, which is very poor. Two of the discs were loose and the tabs that hold the dvds are broken. One of the discs is scratched because of this. It is playable, but I think they could have done a better job on designing the case for the discs to ensure this doesnt happen. The second volume had the same issue. I wouldn't mind paying a few dollars extra, if the pacakaging had been better.I may still order the next season at some point, but just be aware of the case issues if you order this set. I was lucky that mine weren't scratched severly with the little pieces of broken plastic I found in these cases."
3,Mod Squad for 60's audience,"If you were a teen in the 60's then this is a great series. Clothes, music, and plots all fit this era. DVD quality is not HD quality but still ok. I can only handle so much of this 60's stuff in one sitting, you might be able to handle more!"
1,Series: 5 Stars; DVD 1 Star!!!,"Yet again the moneygrubbing, bloodsucking leechs running the studios decide to rape as much money out of fans as possible by splitting up a season into two costly volumes. Will the incredible greed and stupidity never end? Jeez...."
4,A real time capsule,"This DVD is a real flashback into Sixties TV,if you grew up then you can't help but relate to these characters........and OMG I'd forgotten how cute Peggy Lipton was!"
2,BOYCOTT HALF SEASONS!,ANOTHER HOLLYWOOD RIP OFF! A HALF SEASON FOR A FULL SEASON PRICE.AS THE SQUAD WOULD SAY... BUMMER!I AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS REFUSE TO SPEND DOUBLE THE MONEY NO MATTER HOW HIGH THE QUALITY OF THE SERIES. THE FACT IS MANY OF THESE DISCS ARE MADE IN MEXICO AT THE LOWEST COST POSSIBLE. TO CHARGE SUCH HIGH PRICES IS A BLATANT DISREGARD FOR THE WORKING PEOPLE THAT ENJOY SHOWS LIKE THIS.BOYCOTT! BOYCOTT! BOYCOTT!
1,"sticking to my guns, can you dig that????","A half a season for a full seasons price??? I loved this show but I'm drawing a line in the sand. I'm not paying this for just a half season, I don't care how much I loved it. Stubborn? yes, but I'm sick of being taken for a sap by greedy, money grubbing studios."
4,A Solid Career Overview,"Chris Spedding has been an ace sideman for a long time. He has worked with Bryan Ferry, Eno, John Cale, plus many others. This compilation is a good introduction to his work. The best songs for me are Hurt By Love and Pogo Dancing. The songs encompass many rock and roll styles and he is an excellent guitarist."
3,Not The Very Best,"First time i knew about Chris Spedding was in 1977 Bryan Ferry's album In Your Mind. Chris's play here is superb. When the original Cafe Days album was released i bought it inmediately. I was not dissapointed because is a very good album. When the Very Best was released i had great expectations about the album. The album is OK but only presents the early songs (1969-1981). This information is very important to be missed. In my opinion was presented in the back cover of the album deliberated to sell more. Because the dates, Cafe Days and other albums are excluded. Chris Spedding is an excellent music and I recommend to buy at least an album of this artis. Buy if you are looking for the best of this artist, this is not the album to buy. I think you better buy Cafe Jacques Revisited that comes with 6 bonos tracks, of course you miss the early songs. Or buy In Your Mind that is one of the best Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music) albums."
1,Save your money and time!,"My children received this toy as a gift and couldn't wait to try it. I was very disappointed in the amount of time it took to get everything ready. After giving up on getting the paint to come out of the little cylinders, I added it to the mixing cartridge from the paint bottle, only to have the mixer do a poor job. I mixed it better just by shaking it. The color chart is good for those who are just learning about mixing colors. We got a lot more mixing and painting done with a styrofoam egg carton, paint and brushes. I would advise spending money on paint and paper (and a color wheel) and skip this gizmo."
1,Don't buy this!,"Total waste of time and money (although it was gift, for which I feel bad). Poorly engineered--too much work to set up and ultimately, you can't even get the paint to come out of the little cylinders. Frustrating for me, even! Let alone my son. Avoid this toy."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,Kids will have just as much fun and less frustration mixing paint the old fashion way ~ with a paint brush. This toy is too complicated for my 4 year old and a waste of time for the effort. The set up and clean up may be OK for an 8 year old. The paint mixing dispensers didn't squirt out the paint easily. The mixer part was the only fun part (besides actually painting with the paint) for my daughter. Just buy paint and brushes and skip this toy.
2,Could be better,"This toy was a gift for our 3 year old, which according to the box is within the target age. It's impossible for her to do herself, and the paints do not squirt into the mixing bottle easily. Also, you need to use LOTS of paint to be able to mix anything up--even though the paint squirts out in little drips. Definately could be better. We are learning about what happens when you mix colors, however, this could be done without the toy altogether."
5,Great!,"Now, this is one of the best hard rock albums of the early 70's, and probably the whole decade. Actually, why don't I add that it's probably one of the best ever. Every song is top- notch. Steve Marriott's vocals are amazing throughout, and Frampton's guitar is an easy match. This is a true masterpiece, highlighted by ""Sour Grain"" and the humor- filled ""79th and Sunset"". This album is a classic rock essential."
5,"""Rock On""--Humble Pie","Another Great Cd--by this Band.Too Bad all you hear on the Radio from these guys isfor the most part--""I don't need no Doctor""--Live from theFillmore.--starts out with the Frampton song--""Shine on"".Which is Great."
3,"Good information, some new some old, ridiculous price for the book","The book haas some great advice and insight as do other books I have read on the subject. When I received the book I was a bit shocked as the price tag being $61.95 and the book itself is abut 7 inches in length and five inches wide with 169 pages total. I read this book during my lunch. While the author included some nice tools to measure your school's climate oroverall health, I felt the book was seriously over priced. I can't get past the dollars I paid for this book. I would loan it out but not recommend anyone purchasing the books for such a price."
2,Lots of recycled material,"There were laughs in the book. Overall I was disappointed that so much of it was recycled from her stand up shows. If she is going to expect people to lay down money for a book, the least she could do is come up with some new material. As it is, the book is barely 200 pages and a good number of them are blank except for a section number. Her rants on politics were not funny."
3,It ain't that funny!,"I like Wanda Sykes, but this book just isn't that good. If you expect to sit and laugh the whole time you are reading it, it's not going to happen. I do not regret that I read it, just slightly disappointed. Better just borrow it from someone or get at the library, it is not worth the money. A part of the book is garbage, neither it's funny nor smart."
1,"The literary equivalent to ""Soul Plane""","Folks, just because Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce could skillfully mix the profane and the profound with their comedy doesn't mean everybody can do it. This is an example of a weak attempt to mix the two. I would agree with another reviewer that one reason this book falls flat is because you have to hear Wanda's high-pitched whine for her comedy to work as opposed to seeing it in print. In cold print, this just comes off as a bunch of mean-spirited, unfunny, profane rants akin to what you could hear from a barroom or barbershop (or in this case, beauty parlor) loudmouth on paper. the literary equivalent ot ""Soul Plane."" Don't bother."
3,Wanda is The Very best stand up... this book is good.,Wanda is the #1 in female stand up. Her voice is one of a kindand her comedy is always hilarious. In this book something is missing. It falls a little short on content. Some of the book is material I have heard in her stand-up. It is not as good on paper.Her inflection is missed.Its a quick read with her brutally honestpolitical views. It would be better if the title was Hear me talk. Even Bush supporters would find her opinions funny and havesome truth to them.She was a big fan of Clinton which I find refreshing because he has not been given enough good credit in my opinion.
5,Best. Book. Ever.,"This book is amazing. If you love watching Wanda on stage you'll love this book. The books not really about anything specific, she just talks about whatever comes to her mind. But beware, the book is not for kid (obviously of you know Wanda, you know that). But overall, it was pretty good..."
3,I love Wanda...which may be why I'd heard an awful lot of this material,"I've seen every one of Wanda Sykes' standup shows that I could, so a lot of this I could recognize as word for word from different routines she's done. I still loved it, though, and some of it was new to me. Well worth it. And I meant to give it 4 stars, but this page won't let me change it!"
3,From Extremely Funny to Extremely Rude,"First, let me say that I love Wanda Sykes. She's a hoot, but parts of her book just didn't come out the way I think she intended it. I can laugh at tasteless jokes and dialogue, which explains why I could sit through movies such as the American Pie trilogy to Wedding Crashers with my father. However, I couldn't seem to find the humor in some of her monalogue on whites vs. blacks and the strange rant on gastric bypass. Overall, I would recommend this to someone who wants a quick read and needs a few laughs. Wanda doesn't disappoint, but remember the title when you come across some of those sections that seem outright offensive."
5,"""Yeah, I Said It""",Wanda Sykes' brand of humor is significantly underrated. She is a highly intelligent comedian as witnessed by her trememdous insight into the human condition. I tend to be a fairly serious person but I found myself laughing out loud from the beginning of the book to the end. I am hungry for more so you can imagine how frustrated I was to learn she hasn't written anything since this book.
4,"Good book, but old edition","I use this book for my ESL class. It's a good book, but the old edition( the 3rd edition). There is a new edition, the 4th edition of this book, wich is more expensive. They added some chapters and changed some articles in the 4th edition. But I will say 90% are the same. You need make copies for the new articles that are missing in this edition if you need them."
4,english book,"the book is good it works for a class that we are supposed to have the newer edition but its fine, the books are almost identical> works great book came in the condition it was promised"
5,Great textbook,The Writer's Response is helpful and interesting. Its structure is written well and is easy to understand.
1,This is the worst book I've ever read!,Some of his explanations are not correct. Get another book. Don't waste your monety.
3,Great if just for the multiplayer,"The single player campaign in Lost Planet wasn't too bad. There were some pretty cool boss battles and the graphics are pretty strong, but the lame story, which is so convoluted it's annoying, really knocks it down a few pegs. The control, save for the turning mechanics feel pretty good and the diversity of weapons, mechs, and fire effects are great. The single player campaign, even with all of the updated graphics has a distinct old-school feel to it... almost giving me the NES vibe of some of the old Capcom games. That's definitely something that gave me a good feeling playing it.The multiplayer though, is what makes Lost Planet for me. The mayhem that breaks out on levels like Pirate Fortress is totally insane and fun to participate in or watch from afar. The weapons and explosives are a blast to use regardless of some of the balance issues. The team modes are the most fun for me, and Post Grab can be really intense with 2 good teams."
2,A stupid idea gone south,"I have played this game for about 4 hours and have made it into the second level. It's boring!! Why in the hell would you fight the boss fight at the end of level 1 and then take it right up again on the next level, with two of the same bosses instead of one??. WTF??? It is too dumb beyond belief. The story line is like some crappy saturday filler cartoons for mongoloid children. Spare me, please, and don't get this game. I was so jacked for it and then after playing it felt like I'd been taken for a ride.....over the rainbow of stupidity to land in the nation of bland, repetitive god-awful ideas allowed to see the light of day. Capcom needs to find another outlet. Obviously, this remorseful effort deserved to be murdered at birth."
5,I've lost my husband and my son to this...,"The most qualified people in my house to write a review on this would be my husband and my son but since I can't seem to get either one of them away from this game you'll have to settle for me repeating what I hear.This game is awesome!I can't believe how well thought out this game is!Look out Halo!How did we not have this before?And it goes on and one but honestly I tune them out. So I would have to recommend, based on what I hear, this game to everyone. I personally do appreciate the fact that my husband and son can play a game together that is not M rated."
3,Fun but nothing to write home about,"Lost Planet is another in a long line of average shooters. This one has a somewhat interesting story line and interactive structure that makes it a cross between Indiana Jones and Starship Trooper. Besides that, it's nothing special. If you love shooters and the well of games you haven't played is running dry then pick it up. If you've got something better to play, then by all means skip this one."
3,Pretty But Boring,"Looks great, but this game was just so boring to me. Even when you were shooting things and running around in various vehicles and robot contraptions, it still felt totally lackluster. The visuals are the strong point, from the enviornments to the creature designs; It also features the best explosions in any game so far; But the controls are slightly off and sluggish, and the pace of the game matches the character movements...slooooow!! Whatever that 'it' is that makes similar games fun(RE4, for one...just a different setting; also by Capcom...), or just other games fun in general, seems to have somehow eluded Lost Planet. It is such a shame, because the potential is clearly there. Maybe if it was designed as a first person shooter...But I say that about alot of games. Gears of War, anyone? If you must see for yourself, rent it."
3,2D side-scroller in 3D,"I, along with it seems many others, recommend renting this one before you buy it. Lost Planet just didn't do it for me. The game looks great, yes, but it is essentially just a 2D side-scroller from the days of yore, only in 3D. I'm just not one for the whole ""fight, mini-boss, fight some more, big boss, end of mission"" equation. If you look past the graphics there really isn't anything new being offered. If that's your bag, though, then you might love the game and you can write a review on how I'm wrong. This one just wasn't for me.Kudos to Capcom for the subtitles option. Every game should have at least an option to turn on subtitles for Deaf and Hard of Hearing gamers. Again, thanks Capcom."
2,Single Player - Multi-Player...Both Suck...,"I played the mulitplayer download of this game and was not impressed with anything it had to offer. I then tried the full version of the game in an attempt to try to find out if it had any hidden glory. I wasted my time. This game offers nothing unique and the graphics are not worth raving about. Enemies are too easy to kill and the ""light up"" weak spots are childish and lame. With so much potiential, this game was a huge disappointment."
3,Solid 360 Game,"I bought this at EB because I heard that it was good and it looked cool. I brought it home and was satisfied. It had awesome graphics, great weapons, easy to use controls, and cool looking enemies. I particularly enjoyed the grappling hook thingy. Xbox Live was fun too. Now you now the good; now onto the bad.Bad*If you thought Halo 2 was short and were upset about it then you'll be smashing windows over this. Very short. Only eleven missions. I beat it in two days on normal after only buying the game on the very first day I started playing it. Very mad about this.*Weak story. After watching the first few cutscenes I just skipped them from then on.*I really liked playing the story mode for the first third, as it was just as the game was described. After that it was like playing Robotech or Transformers because you were fighting or in giant robots and that was annoying.OverallI liked it. Besides its major flaws it is a solid 360 game. Would buy a sequel if it came out."
3,"Decent graphics, but mundane","This game is a bland third person shooter especially compared to Gears of War and Rainbow 6 Vegas. While it looks decent, it has serious framerate stuttering particularly during boss battles. It also requires you to gather energy from dead foes, barrels, etc. or else you die. This forces you to rush at times and removes any tactical element to the game. Its an ok game and I'll probably finish it, but its not worth $60."
3,Kind of bland,"This game just feels kind of boring and repetitive to me. I forced myself to keep playing it, but after getting through a few levels, I gave up. Having just completed Rainbow Six: Vegas and Gears of War, this game doesn't even come close to those two. One positive, as stated in some other reviews here, is the graphics are good, and I didn't find the thermal energy to be as much of a detraction as some people did. I just didn't find myself unable to put the controller down as with other shooter games."
2,Good for kids,"If you're an older gamer, say 18+, this game really doesn't cut it. Long movies and TERRIBLE multiplayer action led me to dislike this game. Multiplayer looks like it was on a deadline and they just released what they had completed. Campaigns are ok... and by ok, I mean just ok. The graphics are unparalled, but the game is shallow and only 1 player.Great for kids, not so much for the older gamers. GoW is much more fun and involved."
2,A GREAT LOOKING ARCADE GAME,"Wooow..... you run!..... You shoot...... You get shot..... YOU GET A MEDKIT!..... youre all right to keep running and shooting.This is like those old arcade games in which you loose ""energy"" when you get shot and your ""energy"" goes up when you get a medkit or eat something.Nothing like the great games where you die from one well placed shot, and you really have to take care of yourself, crouching, hiding, taking cover, and THINKING about what you have to do to survive..... No MEDKITS to save the day, and no lives.HAIL rainbow six vegas!, Ghost recon AW!, GEARS OF WAR!, and all the real tactical shooters (Americas Army on the PC is another one of those).This game is great for pure action lovers, but if you like tactics, dont even rent it.(just my humble opinion anyway)."
4,"Great game, with some flaws.","Well, first off let me say, this is my first ""Lost Planet"" game, so im not completely familiar with it. The gameplay is smooth, although its rather easy to get lost. The Akrid are cool, and some of the battles are pretty intense. But, there is a limited number of types of Akrid. I think 4, maybe 5 so far? Thats okay with me, but some may take issue with it. All in all its a fun game, but its not perfect. 4/5."
3,Good: Note Great,"Some good ideas and occasional excitement are marred by tedious, juvenile cut scenes and artificial difficulty that is ""engineered"" through the old trick of extended reload time for your more powerful weapons.This is a rental or a borrow. Save your money for one of the Halos, Gears of War or Elder Scrolls Oblivion."
4,Good,"I didnt get very far in the game because I enjoy COD a bit,more I will play more and hopefully it gets better"
4,Not too shabby of a game,"My family (dad and bro) really enjoy this game. While not too complex in story line the graphics are good and the twist for thermal energy is unique. I've read the reviews that gave this game 1 stars, and their main complaint is the thermal energy. Frankly, this game was easy enough on normal not to worry too much about thermal, and I thought it really made this game special. Although needing this thermal in volcanoes or indoors doesn't make too much sense, it does when you're out there in the freezing cold; you need something to keep you warm! Anyway, I enjoyed this game, and the only real complaints are the story line and cheesy cut scenes. Other than that, if you like 3rd person shooters and a nice game to play, this is your pick!"
2,BORING,"I usually live for games like this ... but this game ... B-O-R-I-N-G. It is the same thing over and over again. It really has no redeming values. After the first 5 min ... it just goes downhill. The weapons suck, the enemies are always the same ... it really was no fun and a waste of money. I am going back to playing Gears of War for the 1,000th time ... and enjoy it."
1,Dont even come within 20 feet of this mess,"This game may have been the biggest let down of the year. Everyone was hyped up for it, but the story line makes no sense at all, and the whole time your playing the game you have to run around like in mario 64 collecting coins, but this time they are little things called thermal energy to keep you warm, but if you dont collect them, your thermal meter ends up running out and you die. Its honestly retarded, whoever made this game must have been extremly high while creating it, because its probably one of the worst games i have ever played. When your fighting a boss, you have to worry about your stupid thermal energy meter and try to run around collecting the little red things, while fighting the boss is already a hastle. All in all, i would say this game deserves no starts, unfortunately amazon made me give it at least one star. Dont rent it, dont buy it, and dont even play it at Best Buy if they have it out."
4,Interesting,"I did have high expectations of the game and most of it was was to my liking...The story line was confusing, but does come together at the end... Thermal energy collecting did present a to be a difficult feat at times specially with some of the bosses, but I think all in all I rather enjoyed the game"
4,Lost Planet is Pretty Fun!,"PROS:Very decent graphics, no gripes hereThe physics make this game very fun, you get satisfaction from blowing the tar out of giant bug thingsSound is excellent, it sounds incredible with surroundSimple controls and gameplay allow for a very smooth running gameCONS:Online leaves alot to be desiredCutscenes are dumb and longNot worth the 60 bucks yet, more like 50Repetitive missions are sometimes annoying, don't try to play this in one sitting"
3,Before the Magic,"Though largely ignored by critics, Vince Guaraldi developed one of the most distinctive, original, and joyous sounds in jazz piano. (Perhaps only Thelonious Monk is as instantly recognizable.)However, Guaraldi did not really find his ""voice"" on the instrument until 1962's ""Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus."" His prior recordings, ""Vince Guaraldi Trio,"" ""Flower Is a Lovesome Thing,"" and ""Jazz Impressions"" (which is really just a sampler of the two former works) are simply unexceptional West Coast jazz. The lightness of mood on these three early albums is further accentuated by the absence of a drummer.Vince Guaraldi has often been labelled ""easy listening."" For the most part, that characterization is unfair, and reflects the accessibility of his work rather than its artistic merit. On these first three albums, however, the characterization is very apt."
5,Perfect,Was exactly what I was looking for. Not cheap tin but nice heavy chrome. Looks great on the car it was bought for.
5,Superior looking sturdy frame,"Wow, This frame really catches your eye when you look at a car from behind. I put it on the rear plate of my 2010 Silver Maxima and it looks great with the other chrome detailing which exists on my car. Its heavier and not one of those cheap bendable plate frames. Id be willing to pay double for this frame being that the quality and appearance are even better than expected. 5 star purchase with no second thoughts."
1,Cannot rate what I do not have....yet....,I rate it as one as I have yet to recieve it? Why do you people ask for reviews way before people get what they purchased?
3,Eddie's Father,"These are fond memories of a simpler time. Eddie was so sweet we named our son Brandon after the child actor. The first DVD is clear and lovely. The downside is that now I am hearing impaired and closed captioning was not an option in 'the olden days'. I cannot distinguish most of the dialogue, but love it all anyway. The first disk, at least, seems fine, although the case it arrived in was mashed to smithereens but there was no way to communicate to Amazon without returning the entire package. Explaining this to a real, live person isn't possible without a phone number and the choices in the return items screen do not fit the situation."
1,We want a regular DVD release!,I am so sick of these DVD-R releases for some of these TV series. The studios should just release them on regular DVDs or license them out to other companies who will. Made on Demand DVD-R's totally suck.
3,Pendulum review,The only complaint that I have is that the songs do not coincide with the titles. I tried to correct the titles on my hard drive but they change back to the original version.
5,IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT TO VEGAS!,"Tripoly is a fantasic adult game, especially if your friends love gambling! A great game to take out with a bottle of wine and six to eight friends. Better than ""POKER NIGHT"" -- since, you don't have to know anything about the game to have a blast playing it. We always assign each color chip a dollar amount, similar to poker just to make the game more interesting (AND FUN)."
1,Hado,I'm sorry to say I can not recommend the book. I know about the subject of energy and I know several who work with energy including two friends that are Reiki Masters and practicioners. This book is more of an autobiography than a teaching book. You can find better information in books from Barbara Ann Brennan and many other authors.
3,Interesting healing method,"Hado is a Japanese term for some sort or sorts of energy, but what exactly it is is hard for me to understand when we don't have this concept in English.Its various applications are explained in this delightful little book - healing, cleansing rooms, houses and items, clairvoyance, etc. Various exercises for developing one's Hado are included.In the course of reading the book I felt that it itself emitted a ""good"" Hado - a strong positive energy. I had never felt this from a book before. Towards the end the author, who incidentally is a Hado master, revealed that she had filled all the books with Hado!She encourages the reader to visualize her face (a photo is provided) when using Hado as he or she will then connect with her and her greater power.An interesting and ""different"" little book!"
