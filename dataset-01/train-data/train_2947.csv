4,Just what I was looking for.,"As a new resident to the city, I was looking for a map that would provide the location of dinner and night life, and the best ways to get there. This map does exactly that. It shows which streets have the most resteraunts and bars, and the streets you need to navigate to get to them. I've also been using it to plan any driving as it has an accurate portrayal of the various 1 way streets in D.C.The map focus' on downtown, which is convenient, since that's where I now live. So, it includes Capital Hill, Dupont Circle, Adams Morgran, Cleavepark, and many more. I does not, however include much of Northern D.C. up to Maryland, such as Chevy Chase, or into the Virginia side, such as Arlington. But, it is great for planning a night out on the town."
3,"Same great gameplay, if you can get past the graphics","The GBA conversion of the Dreamcast classic Jet Grind Radio was surprisingly transferred well onto the GBA, but this DC to GBA port suffers more due to the memory constraints of the system. When you get past Crazy Taxi's chunky graphics and almost non-existant sound, you'll find the same addicting gameplay that made Crazy Taxi a hit in the arcades, the Dreamcast, and the various other systems it has been released on since. The controls are as simple as they are on home systems, and the taxi handles almost as good as it has on it's other versions. The only major drawback of Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride, and it is a big drawback, is the chunky and sometimes misshapen graphics that are almost reminiscent of the original Star Fox for the Super Nintendo way back when. If you can get past the graphics though, you'll find a solid game that is worth giving a look."
2,Not a good game at all!,"Pros:- Portable with the GBACons:- Horrible graphics.- Horrible soundtrack.- Very boring, have other GBA games that are very much funer and have better graphics.- PS2 version is mcuh better.- Mini games aren't even worth playing.Overall, if you mistaked to buy this, just playing if you have absolutely nothing else do to. To other people who are going to purchase this, don't, it's not as good as you think."
2,A Disappointment,"This is a terrible game and a disgrace to the successful and usually fun ""Crazy Taxi"" series. I will make a list of the good and bad things about this game.Good:~If you don't open it you can return it and get your hard earned money back to spend on something else. (Such as ""Harvest Moon"" games.)________________________________________________________________Bad:~Graphics are probably the worst I have ever seen in any video game.~Sound track is boring and the same as all the other ""Crazy Taxi"" games.~Nothing new! Almost an exact copy of all the other games.~ The mini games (called ""Crazy box"")are boring and pointless.________________________________________________________________Anyway, take my advise and do not purchase this game!"
3,it's okay,"I just bought a GBA sp and this is my first game. I really enjoy playing this game in the arcade so I figured that this would be fun to play mobile. The graphics don't match to the arcade very well (very boxy), but it's mobile. Once you realize that GBA will never look like the arcade, ps2 or gamecube and just enjoy the mobility of some of you favorite games you will come to appriciate this game."
4,So-so,"It's okay, not spectacular, there definitely have been worse, and there have definitely been better. It's okay, the turning leaves something to be desired, and the graphics seem a little choppy at times, but other than that, it's an okay game."
4,The best game ever!,this game is the bomb excellent graphics so fun and no matter what you never get sick of it because you can do whatever you want in it!!!
1,Do not waist money for this Crazy horrible Game,its boring pointless and stupidgrafics 1/5fun 0/5sound 1/5game play 2/5
5,The Soul Of Lena,"This 1966 lp finds the great Lena in a more soulful musical setting with background vocals and a swinging rhythm section, during this period in Lena's career she recorded several lp's in different styles (Lena In Hollywood, and the wonderful ""Latin"" lp), 'Soul' is another example of Lena's diversity as a vocalist, just listen to her smooth delivery on 'A Taste of Honey'. The 'Soul' cd is another great addition to the Lena Horne catalog."
5,Great Compilation,Brings back great memories of when I listened to country music in the early 90's. I loved Travis and this has all the songs that I can belt out with him in the privacy of my car :)
4,Good collection!,I really liked this guy in the 80's. never realized how many great songs this guy sings! Great voice!!! You'll enjoy this collection of hits!
5,I did not order this album...,I did not prder this album from here but I have it and it is if you like Travis Tritt very good and as it says The very best of Travis Tritt.
3,Some I really liked,"For the price, it was ok. I was never that big of a Travis Tritt fan. I didn't care for his musical politicle views."
4,Good Compilation Record,I started buying greatest hits albums for artists that I like but don't necessarily collect. This compilation has every song I wanted from Mr. Tritt's catalog.
5,Absolutely great,"I love Travis Tritt. What a great singer and performer. Every song on this CD is great, both vocally & musically!"
2,EDITED SINGLE VERSIONS...NO THANKS.,"3 EDITED SINGLE VERSIONS, INCLUDING THE BEAUTIFUL ""TELL ME I WAS DREAMING,"" WHICH IN ITSELF IS SACRILEGE. ADD TO THAT THE OMISSION OF ""PUT SOME DRIVE IN YOUR COUNTRY,"" AND I'M SORRY I BOUGHT THIS. JUST ORDERED THE 1995 COMPILATION AS AN IMPORT FROM A SELLER IN FLA, WHICH HAS THE FULL-LENGTH ALBUM VERSIONS, AND ""DRIVE."" COULDN'T GIVE THIS ONE AWAY !!! RHINO FINALLY LET ME DOWN..."
5,"Excellent Collection, Even Better Price","I picked this CD up as an afterthought while searching for some background music for a play I was putting together, and while it cost less than half of the other swashbuckler soundtrack CDs, it has more tracks than most, more variety than any(dramatic to romantic to action), and solid sound quality. If you're after a whole collection of the Korngold era tunes in one CD, this is it."
2,"Beautiful Pictures, Terrible Writing","Richard Dawson is known for his wonderful western photographs. Unfortunately he chose to partner with an inexperienced writer that is unable to produce anything of value to add to this book. As a coffee table book, this would have been so much better if the text had been left out and the pictures were all that it contained. Tammy LeRoy should try to find another occupation and leave the writing to someone with talent, style and a reasonable vocabulary."
5,Beautiful,"I love these bird baths. They are so beautiful and the birds really use them (especially Cardinals). You do have to clean them a few times in the summer due to mold that can build up, but its no big deal. I have two and love them! Amazon has the best prices on them. I shopped around and most places are asking twice what you can get on Amazon.PS - make sure to bring them inside if the low temps drop below freezing."
3,Enjoyed it,I enjoyed this book. We needed it for a study with friends and it came in with plenty of time to spare. Good study!
3,Picture not as big as stated,I bought this to install in an RV. The picture and sound quality are both good. It is not a 9 inch picture though. The screen may be nine inches but it seems to always be in a wide screen mode so you lose about 3 inches of picture. The radio antena is not very powerful and it is difficult to get stations tuned in.
3,Disposable TV?,"So I bought this TV for my kitchen 12/28/08 and it's been awesome. I can't believe how much I love having it for my morning news (traffic report), favorite shows and evening news while making dinner. About a month ago the screen started going out. It would come on for a few seconds and then the screen would go blank but still had the sound. The screen is totally out now but you can hear the sound. This TV lasted under two years and I paid about $280 at the time.Why can't anyone make a great under the cabinet kitchen TV?Well I broke down and ordered another one. I'm thinking this is going to be more of a disposable TV in that I may need to replace it every two years. I'm getting the same one since I love the picture/sound quality and the cabinets are already drilled for that specific model.I still find it crazy to have to buy another one but I really do like this TV (when it works :))..."
1,Screen failure after 14 months,"I bought the Audiovox VE927 14 months ago from a local retailer. I paid a fair price and was happy with the product for about 14 months. The picture/sound isn't great but suitable for watching in the kitchen. And 'watching' is the key word. After 14 months the picture starting going out after it was turned on for a short period of time. It has progressively gotten worst. The picture just monentarily comes on and then goes out. Every thing else functions - ie. all sound, channel changing, etc. But a TV is limited without a picture. However, I do listen to it - at least until I receive a new product (not Audiovox)which I have purchase from Amazon. Audiovox can't be very proud of their product with only a 90 day warranty. It would probably cost me more to get it fixed vs purchasing a new item. With quality like this, we'll see Audiovox on with an 'out of businness' sign before long."
3,Used in the kitchen,"Recently we had to replace a small 5"" CRT undercounter TV that had been of good service for many years. Believe me when I tell you that ""they don't make them anymore."" After doing a lot of research on what was available, we choose the Audiovox VE927 with the 9"" screen. The TV has been in operation for a little over a month and works fine. The picture is clean and bright and the sound can be adjusted to be heard over the noise of cooking. The DVD works fine and the AM/FM radio is better than our old unit. It does have a few short-comings. The TV screen is 9-inch but when in the TV mode it only displayes a 7-inch picture (it measures 9-inches when in the DVD mode). The digital clock does not display all the numbers (we have clockes all over the kitchen so it was not worth the effort to return the unit because of this defect). In general, so far so good."
4,this product works well,"we purchased this under the counter tv about 2 months ago. it was easy to install the picture is great. but it is on cable. the radio doesn't work to good. but, I didn't buy it for the radio, we haven't tried the dvd player. but I'm sure its ok. the remote has a magenet on it, so I just stick to the fridge. makes it easy to find. I would remend this unit to anyone...."
3,kitchen TV,"I am a bit disappointed w/ the quality of the picture--I can't figure out what it is that needs to be tweaked. It also is smaller than I expected--the TV picture does not use the entire screen and I do not think that is adjustable for TV, altho' it may be for DVD which I have not tried. The buttons on the remote are teeny. But since this is more of a background TV for me and I watch it only for short periods of time, it works for me. I have not tried the radio or DVD player--probably never will. I bought it for the TV only, and that is adequate for my purposes."
2,"Large Screen, Poor Visibility","I selected the Audiovox VE927 because of it's large LCD. However, I found the screen difficult to see a even at slight angle. Also, after I installed the unit, I found that the LED display (Clock and Function display) didn't work at all. The installation was challenging enough that I didn't want to uninstall it (for a refund or a replacement).On the positive side, the audio is good and the TV works well (when you get the screen adjusted.)"
2,DVD Player freezes,"I bought this unit for my wife this Christmas. It looks nice and everything works great except for the DVD player. It takes about 2 minutes for a DVD to load to the main menu, then another minute or 2 to actually start playing the DVD. Sometimes, it just freezes and all menu buttons become unresponsive. This requires the unit to be powered off and the process starts over again. Maybe I got a lemon, but this unit is no longer in stock, so I can't swap it out. Bottom line, it looks and works nice if you don't us the DVD."
2,"it works, but nothing to brag about","Yes, there is a picture and there is sound. No matter how much I attempt to adjust the audio, it still sounds very tinny. After making some adjustments to the video, we were able to get a picture that's not excessively dark.Easy to install, using the template that comes with the tv. Easy to set up with the included remote. I bought this model - after much research - only because I couldn't find anything better. Apparently, not many companies make tv's that mount under a cabinet.In summary: yes, it works. No, it ain't great."
4,Picture quality poor.,"Picture quality not the best, too dark. Difficult to get proper contrast. Numbers in clock window difficult to read unless you stand close to it. Otherwise the unit is attractive."
5,Very Happy!,The TV is great for the price! The screen folds back so when it is not on you are not knocking into it for any reason. We are very pleased with the purchase.
4,Measure b4 ordering!!!!,"When I ordered this TV, I assumed we had standard kitchen cabinets, well lo and behold ""ancient cabinets"" which were to small to accomodate the TV!! The TV itself played beautiful, clear and crisp...... so sorry it didnt fit! Would reccommend"
3,"Audiovox VE927 9""","We got this for our kitchen; it was hard to get up but is nice being out of the way and can turn to view from various parts of the kitchen. It is a bit small screen. After some time I tried the DVD player and it did NOT work, you need to check yours before installing! We will not send it back as it was too hard to install and we really did not need the DVD player on this one. So I will give it a 3 out of 5 stars due to DVD not working and hard to install."
1,Remote doesn't work,We've had this for about a year. We barely use it (it's in the kitchen) but would use it more if the remote worked. We sent the original remote back and had to buy another one which also doesn't work. Very unhappy with this product.
4,So far so good,Lost my last unit like this to lightning. This newer version is almost identical however had to drill holes in cabinet a small distance from holes for the previous one. Trying not to use the buttons on the unit since they broke from from frequent use on the last one.
4,Under cabinet review,"I recently installed the under counter TV and it has worked pretty good. I've only been using it for 1 month and so far i have no real complaints. The only issue i had is with the screws that came with the TV were 3"". I actually needed 3.5"" or longer because of my cabinet. In all i made it work but it was a bit difficult to find those screws. I would recommend this product."
3,Audiovox drop down TV,"Great unit however when I mounted it, two nuts came out of the cabinet and bent the upper cover. I've had to use baling wire to mount it thru the holes I previously drilled in the cabinet after moving out all the wife's junk. A better or sturdier mounting method would be beneficial. TV and all works great but what a hassle to put up. My wife, who it was intended for, was not overjoyed when I had to visit the hardware store to get the baling wire as I had already removed the TV which sat on the counter and she had to do the dishes without soaps on the TV to watch (poor thing). An unhappy wife can make life a bit difficult and calls for several beers or a few good hard drinks to loosen one's self up. I would suggest a supply of baling wire and beer for any prospective installer, especially if it's for his wife. From a technical standpoint it's a great unit but gets old fast on the honeydo list."
2,did not work,"the tv had no picture when i got it, sent it back to audiovox to have it repaired, im not haven much luck getting it back, so i cant really tell you how good it is"
1,VE927,"It's mostly junk, but there is not much choice for under the counter TV's and you can forget about any tech support."
2,Works but,The unit works great! But the only directions were in spaniard!! The box and unit stinks like the back end of a big dog. Had to air it out for a week!! I was not happy!
5,Great performance! Satisfied!,"Got this a couple of days ago and totally satisfied with the design, the performance...It fit nicely under my kichen carbinet. The installation is easy. The picture is great with DVD and good with TV. The sound is great too. I keep watching it all the time. Very nice product! The best deal I ever had for this year!"
4,Great unit but no MP3 playback,Have had this unit installed for a couple of days. The installation went easy as plenty of spacers to choice from are provided. The digital and analog tuners are working perfectly. The picture is clear and crisp and the audio is satisfactory for the kitchen. It plays burnt CD-R but does not read mp3 files. I was hoping since it recognized CD-R disks that I'd get lucky enough to be able to play mp3s but no dice. Hoping for a firmware upgrade to allow this.
4,"Looks good, works good.","The Audiovox VE927 works good, looks good under our narrow kitchen cabinet. The only issue is trying to install. Do not try this alone, it will take 2 and when I get a chance, I will have help to re-install. The picture is great and folds up out of the way when not in use. Radio works good and DVD also."
2,second one,"The first one that i bought lasted about 9 months but, I liked it so, Ibought a second one. I hope this one lasts longer"
2,Mediocre quality doesn't justify price,"The television screen and clarity is quite good, but this product has significant drawbacks.1. The depth of the unit means that if mounted flush with the front of standard-depth cabinets, you may have problems getting the various cable and audio plugs connected. All these connections are at the rear and there is inadequate space.2. The sound quality is extremely poor.3. Personal opinion but the styling looks clumsy and very dated."
4,under cabinet tv/dvd,A smart design with enough room to plug into cables and wall on back of tv unlike the sony model I previousy had.The screen is bigger than I could have imagined.The buttons are small and confusing to use especially the timer.I've had it for months and I'm still not comfortable with the controls unlike my old sony.In general-great tv for the price.
2,won't last long,"This is second Audiovox I purchased basically because the others are less known names. Out of the box, it seemed like a ggod TV. However, first unit VE700 screen went blank after about 1 year. This new unit lasted 10 months. Developed annoying buzzing sound after 7-8 months and now screen has green lines across all channels. Warranty is only 90 days. Not worth hanging under cabinet only to remove in such short time."
1,warranty is voided by purchasing from Amazon,"I bought this item and loved it, but the TV and DVD quit working after about 70 days. By purchasing the item from this site on Amazon, the Univox warranty was voided and Amazon's warranty only lasts for 60 days. The TV repair people can't get parts, so I am stuck with a $200+ boat anchor.DO NOT BUY ANY ELECTRONICS FROM AMAZON!!! IT WILL VOID THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY!!!!"
1,Dont do it....,"I purchased this T.V for my husband for Christmas last year and one year to date the unit just went blank. We may have used the TV a couple times a week to view morning weather or traffic. Amazon told us to contact Audiovox who told us to contact someone else. At our expense, we can ship the unit to them at a cost of 45 dollars to find out the cause of failure, and then we can pay the cost of repair or replacement. We won't invest any more money to this poorly manufactured product. As of now, there doesnt seem to be an quality under counter unit that could replace it so we will glance at the exposed cable line and wait until for someone to manufacture a television that has a life expectancy a little longer then a butane lighter! The up side...we managed to get a year out of it compared to the other reviews."
1,STAY AWAY,This is a piece of dodo. I read other reviews that said they had problems and didn't listen.It was nice for a short time then the screen went out. Just after the warranty of course.They are too expensive and to hard to mount and wire just to throw it away after 6 months.As of now it is just an expensive clock.
4,Works good,"Got this for my wife to get rid of the boombox on the kitchen counter. Mostly just use the radio but have occasionally used the DVD. Everything works as expected. The sound isn't great, as expected. They told me it was an analog radio but it's digital. Installation was simple. Good bang for the buck."
2,"Works, but audio and video quality are unacceptable","I hope that it's just the particular unit that we got, but the audio quality was so bad that even our 4 year old commented on it. I tried adjusting every setting that I could find with no improvement made. We tried to get used to it, but simply couldn't.The picture quality is also pretty bad. It's grainy and for certain channels refuses to use the entire screen area making it hard to see. The screen is also very reflective making it hard to see in a lighted room. We wouldn't return it just for the bad picture quality, but it certainly added to the overall disappointment.In the end, we just couldn't stand to listen to it any more. Returning it."
1,Not built to last,"The power on/off button broke after 3 months, right after the 90 day warranty expired. Had to use remote to turn it on/off. After 1 year the picture went out. If you still want to buy this, get the 3 year extended warranty, you will most likely need it."
1,Didn't last,"Nice concept, but not a good quality. While I've had the unit for just shy of a year, it's been temperamental from the start. Frequent message of ""no signal"". My previous tv with the same connection did not have this problem. The remote was nearly impossible to work, had to press the keys verrry slow and methodically. Now after 11 months the picture is done, only show a dark orange color. Only plus is that the tv received some channels that my former tv did not. I would not purchase this product again."
4,Fun in the kitchen,"I like the looks of this unit a lot. I have been a little disappointed with the quality of the picture. With an LCD screen as small as thisI was expecting a vivid, sharp picture. It may be my unit but I have seen a lot of screens this size with much better pictures. I like some depth to the sound and this unit is quit tinny and doesn't have a lot of depth. I am in the process of adding a set of speaker boxes to match the unit. I bought a pair of 3.5"" full range speakers to install in the boxes. It has been great to have to watch TV or listen to the radio. I haven't really watched a DVD in it but the grand kids seem to like it. I would recommend the unit for the price. If you have big bucks to spend, get a Sony."
4,Decent product,"We got the Audiovox VE927 and are overall happy with it. The sound is a little tinny and the controls are hard to use, but the picture quality is very good. We've had no problems with it. You really can't beat it for the price and it's nice to be able to sit at the kitchen counter and watch the morning news while having breakfast."
3,Comcast Subscribers Beware,"This TV is ok, but if you don't have a cable box hooked up to it(and who wants to with an under cabinet TV) then it isn't very compatible with some cable providers (especially Comcast)."
4,It's a little better than ok,"This replaced a 7 or 8 year old GE drop down tv which was a wonderful tv/radio/cd player until the buttons stopped working. The Audiovox was a little difficult to install. It could've been me, but I swear the template was off about a 1/4 inch. The picture quality is not as good as my old GE and certainly not as good as I expected. There is what seems to be a long pause when turning on or switching from tv to radio or dvd. Of course, I'm thinking maybe I should've spent a couple hundred dollars more and gotten a little better tv. All in all, it's an ok tv for the money. It serves the purpose."
2,TV broken within 6 days,The good- for the price the unit would had been a good option for a under the cabinet kitchen TV. The picture seemed okay and with the TV flip up down option it does not clutter the kitchen. The bad- the TV stopped working after 6 days. Fortunately we were able to return for a replacement with Amazon. We'll see how the next one works. We are really hoping for the best because the unit is perfect for the space we are putting it in.
4,Audiovox VE927 9 inch Dropdown TV w/ DVD+ Clock Radio,"I have hooked up my TV in an area in the house which does not have cable. I am using a Digital UHF/VHF Antennae which seems to be getting the signals I need. The TV works great and is easy to operate. The problem was the installation onto the cupboard. I previously had an Audiovox TV in the same space but the holes didn't line up. I used the template from the package for the correct measurements yet the holes drilled through the cupboard didn't line up. So it isn't the easiest install but the TV, Radio, DVD works great."
4,Nice product,Mounts easily. Everything works great. Wouldn't recomend any smaller screen but it is nice for kitchen. I hope the reliability is equally as good.
4,easy install,"The hardest part of the installation was getting cable service to the location. Works well, clear picture and decent sound for a minature tv."
4,A little gem,"Audiovox VE927 9-Inch LCD Drop-Down TV with Built-In DVD Player and Clock RadioAs advertised - a little drop down TV for kitchen and adjacent eating area use. A real space saver. It is little, but you are not looking from afar. The screen swivels 270 degrees, not 360, so think ahead before mounting. I worry a little how it will hold up over the long run."
1,BEWARE!,"I read the reviews and no small cabinet mounted television looked great. I chose this one thinking it was the lesser of the evils. I was replacing a 5 year old Poloroid TV. The small issues were that the remote was terrible with the numbers being teeny tiny. The sound was tinny but I could live with it. No problems with installation. The TV is now almost 2 months old and it is BROKEN! Roll the dice on another product, this is not one for you."
2,monitor died,"Monitor died after 6 months, could not read time display.whites blown out, not a good picture at all."
3,Great while it worked!,Purchased this unit 18 months ago because of its appearance and size. Worked fine for this time period then picture went blank and after two trips to repair shop problems could not be eliminated.
1,Warranty is useless!,"It worked for exactly 3 weeks when the screen went blank. I was told by AudioVox to return to their repair facility in Hauppauge, NY.When a month went by and it didn't come back I called and was told that they had told me the wrong place to send it back that they had sent it to Buffalo and that I should recieve it back in a few weeks.Three weeks went by, no TV so I called Buffalo (after being put on hold for close to an hour in both places) that it can't be repaired, that it has to be replaced but they don't have any replacements for it and don't know when they will because it has to come from Hong Kong.So now I've waited three months only to be told they have no idea when I will get a replacement! Never once did they offer to replace it with another product. I suggested they could get one from one of their retail outlets and they told me it didn't work that way, so basically I'm SOL, waiting on a boat from Hong Kong."
1,I've been had!,"I purchased this Audiovox VE927 9-inch LCD Drop Down TV last spring (2008)and had it professionally installed in my brand new kitchen. I was thrilled with picture quality, sound, appearance, and overall functionality. Six and one half months later on a Saturday afternoon, my brand new TV went black...totally dead. Neither Amazon nor Audiovox will take any responsibility for this product after 30 days past delivery. To even have it looked at by anyone costs 25%+ of the purchased price.I am now the proud owner of a very nice looking piece of junk. It is truly disconcerting that $230 is a throw away value these days. Shame on Audiovox and shame on me for missing it so much. This is truly a buyer beware situation."
1,Quit Working after two months......,This tv suddenly went dead for no reason after I had only owned it two months. It was used no more than perhaps 3-4 hours a week before it died. It also did not receive any mishandling in this one middle-aged person household.I would not buy this product again.
2,Disappointed,Product quality is disappointing. Remote control back plate broke before getting the batteries in. SOUND WILL NOT REMAIN AS ONE VOLUME.......CHANGES AT ANY TIME.........Charter Communication Cable division would not install.
1,Audiovox Drop Down TV,"I liked the streamlined appearance. It was easy to install. The picture quality was very bad. It was necessary to adjust the contrast/brightness etc every time the channels were changed. Also,if you don't stand directly in front of it the picture is very dark. In addition, there was a manufacturing defect. Each time the channel was changed with the remote, the screen had a white flash and made a popping noise. Best part-- easy to return to Amazon and get a refund!"
1,Don't buy this product!!!,"Do not buy an this product. I got the 12"" for Christmas. The power stopped after one day. We replaced it with a 9"" (this model). It worked for five weeks. Yesterday I tried to turn it on and there is no power. When you call the 800 number, you are on hold for a customer service rep for at least an hour. Then they make you box it up and ship it back at your own expense to have it repaired or replaced. I made this purchase in good faith, and I should not have to pay shipping for an items that craps out after five weeks. Buyer beware, stay away!!!"
1,Can't somebody make a decent undercabinet?,I should have known better. Audiovox=cheap junk. After not quite 90 days the picture is a blank. I wasn't impressed with the picture or the sound quality. The best I could say was the magnetized remote was a good idea. Save your money until Sony makes one with similar features.
1,Buyer Beware!!,"I received this product as a gift from my company for a job well done and right out of the box, the clock didn't work. I went onto the web site and found out that, although I had registered my product properly, that unless I had a receipt, I would be charged for any repairs. Since I have two other clocks in my kitchen, I decided not to bother. We installed the unit (which was a bit of a pain in the ...) and about two months later, it started making a funny ""clap"" sound whenever you changed the station. Then less than a month after that, the picture went out. Like other reviews, the sound was OK, but no picture. After less than 3 months?!? Well, since I don't have the receipt (since it was a gift), I guess I'm out of luck. I will have to buy a new one, but you can bet it won't be an audiovox!"
5,Great TV for the Kitchen!,"I love this TV! It's my second Audiovox VE927 drop-down TV. I wish the first one had lasted longer, but it was such a good tv (perfect size for my kitchen, great TV picture and sound, great for playing DVD's while cleaning the kitchen!) that when it died after about 3 or 3 1/2 yrs, I was lost without it and wanted to replace it exactly. The store where I purchased the first one no longer carried the tv or anything that looked comparable. Luckily I checked Amazon, and Amazon had it in stock. The price is a lot lower now than when I purchased the first one, which was a pleasant surprise. Thankfully, the new one was EXACTLY like the previous VE927, so I didn't even have to drill any new holes! Thanks Amazon! PS: It really helps if one person can hold the TV up while the other one screws in the 4 screws!"
1,do not buy!!!,"had for less then a year and will no longer play cd or dvd! shows ( bad cd) on screen! my parents bought one also, same problem! so disapointing!"
1,nothing but trouble,"I bought the Audiovox 927 in 2008. One month later, there was no picture. I sent it in and they repaired it and sent it back. At that time, it was more expensive... I spent 300.00 for the tv. I had had an old GE under the cabinet tv that lasted for, probably, 10 yrs. with never a problem. The only reason I had to get a new tv was because the other wasn't digital, and as one reviewer said, there are not many under the cabinet tvs for purchase. Now, I have no picture,again, after having the tv for 3 yrs. Electronics should last much longer. It is a hassle to take this down from the cabinet for repair, but now I, also, hear from a reviewer that it is not worth it to get it repaired.Sounds like Audiovox does not stand behind their products. What a waste of money. I will never buy another Audiovox, anything...a real rip off...don't waste your money."
3,Second One,"I like the product, size and features. Great for under cabinet in kitchen. Got this one even though the first one I had only lasted a little over two years. Keep your receipts!"
2,$230 for 1 year and 9 months,"We bought this in March of 2008. It has worked fine until recently. The picture only shows about 1 out of 5 times of turning it off and back on. I had to turn it on and back off several times to play a DVD today, it worked for a minute--then started showing half of two frames of the movie with a thick black line down the center. Several others have said theirs died at about 2 years, so I guess I should have listened."
2,Didn't get what I paid for,"The unit mounted easily under the cabinet. I was hoping to get away without an antenna, but was only able to receive 2 channels. I purchased a small round amplified antenna from radio shack and with that mounted at the top of the cabinet, was able to receive all of the channels that were available from our local broadcast stations. (Drilled a 5/8"" hole from the top shelf in the cabinet down through to the bottom by the TV.) very pleased with the unit, haven't played a CD, DVD yet. My wife enjoys watching it while she cooks. That makes me happy too.The unit worked great for 18 months, then the picture failed. It was already obsolete and no one would even look into repairing it. Such a great product to begin with, but certainly not worth the money in the end. Very disappointed. I never tried to contact Amazon about this...after working with them recently, I realize I should have at the time the unit failed."
4,Audiovox VE927 9-Inch LCD Drop-Down TV with Built-In DVD Player and Clock Radio,We are very happy with the Audiovox drop down tv. The quality of the picture and the sound quality are very good. The remote control works easily and the tv is very user friendly. It was easy to install. Overall a very satisfying purchase.
2,"audiovox 9"" drop down","I found the picture quality to be very good but I had to return the item due to the sound. The sound was good while listening to voices but when any high pitch music played, it sounded as if the speaker had a rip in it, very raspy."
4,A great TV for the price,We are very happy with this TV. I would rate it 5 stars but the first unit we received had a defective information LCD. It was replaced within two days and the second one has worked great.
3,Not what I needed,"The book is a great book. However, I was looking for something that was tailored more towards a dialysis technician."
5,Great book!!!,"I purchased this book two years ago when I was studying to become BONNET certified, it was an excellent, yet simple read. Whenever I got stuck or didn't understand certain parts, I would refer back to ANNA's core curriculum. I passed with no problem and I loaned it out to help my fellow coworker. That was a mistake, never got it back so here I am purchasing it again. It was worth every cent."
3,A sound finale,"As a keen Ministry fan for many years I was hoping to catch them on their final tour. Alas, yet again there wasn't the demand from Australia in order to bring them here. That being the case I was looking forward to catching this DVD in order to get some sense of what I missed...The result is that Ministry weren't as strong in the end as they once were live despite the release of very good albums after the departure of Paul Barker. The set consists mostly of post-Barker numbers and while they sound good the vibe is not as exciting as the Sphinctour days for example. Sphinctour is more fun.Having said all that I would recomend the disc for fans of the final three Ministry albums."
3,In Case You Didn't Feel Like Bashing Bush...,"Too bad this double DVD set doesn't include the third track listed on the cover. I'm still waiting !! Oh look, there it is. Hiding on the second half of track #2.Also, Tony Campos is the percussion monster and it will be a shame to this final lineup hungup for good due to Grandpa Al's age induced boredom blah, blah, blahh. Check these out if you dare.Revolting Cocks ""Live in Houston, TX /VHS Video TapePigface Live Archive 91-05: Vol.#5 Cabaret Metro Chicago, IL 12/22/92BlatherskiteNine Inch Nails (Rated ""R"" -A Retrospective) /Rare Limited Edition ""Promo"" DVDEXIT/CHICAGO Black Leather Motorcycle Jacket"
3,N'Sync meets Jazzy Lounge Music,"This cd is very comercial, and if you did not know the group you would think that this is an N'Sync cd. Not a party cd. On this page is says that similar artists are Darude, Sarina Paris etc. This is not dance, there is only 1 good song and it is Summer Jam. But personaly even that song is a little too slow. Anyway if you like pop with a slow jazzy feel then this is for you. In my opinion"
3,Too minty.,"I bought these because the description sounded like the product would be less minty and more like citrus (AM) and lavender (PM). Plus, this toothpaste whitens and is good for sensitive teeth. Unfortunately, all I can taste is mint, which I don't like at all. I gave it three stars because it isn't a bad product - it's just not to my taste."
1,"From the look of the preview, this is only an outline of the work","Euclid's Elements consist of 13 books of geometric demonstrations, called ""propositions,"" building in complexity from triangles to multi-sided solids. However, when I looked at the preview of this book, it became obvious that it only provides a list of the titles to each proposition, but never shows the propositions themselves! This means that it is only an outline of Euclid's work, not the work itself, from which the reader can gain nothing of mathematical value. Avoid like the plague."
1,No Proofs!,This book is mathematically worthless. It is useless to anyone educated in mathematics. It list the propositions but not the proofs! There are no logical proofs nor are there any constructions. I give this one star because zero stars is not an option. What a waste of money and space on my kindle! This is analogous to buying a book and getting only the table of contents. This is the first ebook I bought for my kindle and I hope it is not representative of the quality of math books available for the kindle or it will also be a waste of money.
3,It does the job,"This cover does the job. I did, however, find the picture to be misleading: My cover is somewhat see-through and not as brilliant of a yellow. Also, when it initially arrived, the product smelled like gasoline, which is how the plastic was ""rubberized"" (gasoline acted as a solvent - take it from me, a chemist). Finally, now that I have had my cover for about two months, the rubberized layer is beginning to peel off in places (primarily the edges and corners). If I had been able to see and feel (and smell!) the product in person prior to buying it, I would have passed on it."
3,The fall of the gods,"Long, long time ago there was a band called Manowar. They made albums like ""The Triumph of Steel"" and ""Hail to England"", they were loud, and powerfull and they troubled our minds. Unique music coming from rather unique people.Well, now that has changed. In the past one-two albums (Frankly speaking I have lost the count, too much ""steel and hell"")But what about this one? Yes, good sound. A couple of great songs too. Actually if I have to be honest it is a very listenable album. What about the texts? Naa.As one of my favourite poets used to say: ...but the magic was gone."
3,JAPANESE....MELVINS??,"i think this album should be given three and a half stars,but alas,that isn't an option here -anyway,Boris kinda made me think of ""LYSOL"" era Melvins,with an Earth-like tendency to drone.As other reviewers have noted,one can hear a great number of other influences/points of reference as well.bottom line,i found it far from boring but not anywhere near ground-breaking,either.quite heavy,though.........."
2,Bad connectors,The sound crackles if the cord bends a bit at the connector. All around poor quality and construction. I'm thinking about returning it...
2,Headphone extension,"this cord tuned out to not be what I needed.It was too heavy to keep a good connection.My brother ,however used it with his recording equipment and it worked okay.So,good outcome after all.Just consider where your stero headphone connection is located on your equipment-if it is closer to the floor ,this cord will work."
4,Gift for dad,"I gave this as a gift, so I didn't use it, but it looked fine when it arrived and came on time."
5,Prisoner of Zenda,It is as brilliant as I remember it to be. Plenty of action and well worth watching.
5,"A great value, 2 for 1","Both version of this costume drama are good. The 1937 version is the better of the two with Ronald Coleman against the evil Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. This well made is excellent from cast through production. The 1952 version is also very good on its own, but will fade in comparison to the previous one. The production is very good, but it is basically a scene for scene remake of the 1937 film."
2,Double trouble,"Only for the die-hard Zenda fans. The 1952 version is far better in the subtelty of acting, while the color adds a lot in a fairy-tale like this.Would love to have the 1952 version alone on a Dvd of top quality."
4,"Cheap DVD, slightly out of sync","I can't add much to what's already been said, but be warned: the picture and sound are very slightly out of sync on both films. The first time I've ever come across this on a DVD. The DVD is remarkably cheap, but I would have preferred to pay a little more for exact synchronisation."
5,Very Pleased!,"I was leary about ordering a, ""used"" product, never doing so before, but, the book was wonderful, very little wear and more than pleased. Thank you so much!"
2,Strong Smell,"I recently received the Burt Bees Hand repair as a gift and must say this product is disappointing. As a hand creme, it's average. As long as you don't have dry hand, it should keep your hands feeling soft. However, the smell is unpleasant. Have you ever eaten those orange soft candies in the shape of peanuts--I think that they are called `Circus Peanuts'? Well, that is what this product smells like. I had to give it away, I couldn't stand using it because the scent lingers.So, if you like banana scents or the taste of `Circus Peanuts', you may like this product. If not, I would suggest avoiding it."
3,Hot Country?,"I believe these 11 tracks are pushing 50+ years old. The 'Hot' adverb doesn't or isn't applicable to this set, never did. Solid songs for the older set who likes the traditional or semi-traditional country song.It's okay but most of us have moved on. Artwork is bottom-line with no information or booklet.Save your money"
5,Blast from my nightclub past!,"I saw this band a number of times at different venues in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis, Missouri.They were incredible live and I was really excited to see that they included a live show from the Blue Note in Columbia. Great band, great times!"
1,Math Textbook purchase,"Not happy. Ordered textbook on August 1, 2008 and I still have not recieved it. Said delivery was no later than August 25th. It is now Sept 2nd. 2 weeks into school and still no math book."
5,very helpful,"these are very helpful for me...in assisting with keeping my dad'sclothes clean... instead of tryingto tie it in the back, i just tuckit all in under the neck of hisshirt.... keeps the dribbles fromcreeping down his neck..... and makinga mess of everything...."
1,cheap bibs,Every time I went to tie a bib on.........one of the straps would tear off and I would have to staple it together. They are super thin and a piece of junk.
4,The life of the M3 Half-track,This book follows the development of the half-track. From the '30's to its use in by the Isralei Defense Force in the middle-east. In this book we examine and trace the M3's history through the eye of the camera lens. We are also shown all the different version attempted off the M3 frame.
3,Not a barn burning live album,"I'd heard quite alot about this album before buying it, how it was a seminal live performance from Muddy that intoduced blues to the masses and all that kinda talk. But that doesn't quite come across when you listen to it, Muddy is more reserved than in his later live albums and never really seems to let rip. That said the music is good sunday morning blues, particularly 'I've got my brand on you' and that one that Otis Spann sings 'Goodbye Newport Blues'If you want to hear Muddy live i'd go out and buy Muddy 'Mississippi' Waters. Although its recorded nearly 20 years later its much more of an excuse to torch the chicken house."
3,The roots of famine.,"Highlights the economic, political, and environmental factors, which have brought millions of Sudanese people to the brink of survival. Explains how International response to the disaster has been dramatic, and why short-term handouts cannot solve the long-term problems. Argues that understanding the cause of Sudan's current crisis is a vital first step towards preventing the recurrence of a devastating famine.Tony Irags"
5,Corvette Fuel Injection by Probst,I found this book an excellent complement to my OEM factory service manual. This type of publication often provides tips and short cuts not found in OEM publications.
5,Sunny West Coast Traditional Ska,"The Inspector play sunny West Coast ska, heavy with the traditional sound of the Skatalites. There are plenty of bouncy ska instrumentals, plus several upbeat songs with nice vocals. If this doesn't brighten your mood, nothing will.I suppose it's possible to think the Inspector are a little too clean and pure, but if you like traditional ska, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one."
5,definitive collection of the greatest band on the planet,"almost an hour of music spanning 3 singers and 10 years. the perfect cd to listen to while tearing it up on a bicycle. a collection that was put together by fans voting on their website, not a loser in the bunch. subjects covered include rejection, love, genetics, societal stereotypes, food, coffee, pet frogs, and history. once you buy this, you will be unable to resist their complete discography."
1,Miserable POS: avoid,"Got this new, it should be called a bread warmer... it never toasts, no matter the setting. You have to run your bread through 2 or 3 times to even melt butter. Room temperature butter. It's junk."
1,"It ""blows"" as Queen Sophie Anne would say.",This is not the no frills workhorse toaster one would expect. It's worse than the one my family owned forty years ago that lasted twenty years. There is no way to cancel the toasting the way a basic old one could by jiggling the lever to release. Avoid this one.
1,Horrible,Worst toaster ever. I went through 3 bagels and a half loaf of bread before coming up with something edible. Returned it and bit the bullet on something 4x the cost (KitchenAid). I guess toasters are not an area one can skimp on.
1,"Toaster is plastic, and it melts","I was looking for a basic, no frills toaster; this seemed to fit the bill.However, the body is plastic, and after toasting english muffins in it twice (on a lite/med setting), the plastic surround of the openings/slots for the bread/muffin/bagel, melted all around.Sunbeam used to be good brand; this is such a shoddy product I wonder if it even is a Sunbeam, or a knock-off.Amazon's review process will not let me select no stars in order to post a review, so I had to give it one star in order to proceed. But the product is really zero stars."
1,Shoddy construction...,"Purchased the toaster today and decided to give it a test run before breakfast in the morning. Put the bread in and pushed the lever down... which proceeded to snap off in my hand. This one will be going back tomorrow. As another reviewer said 'I guess toasters aren't an area you can skimp on..."""
2,Not good,"I bought this toaster and have to returned it later. The slot is made for regular sized bread or bagel only. If you want toast bigger size bread, you have to cut to half to toast it. The temperature is hard to set right, you either burn your bread or under cook it. Stay away from this toaster, it does not worth time and money to try."
1,Complete Waste of Money!,"This is junk. After one week, the lever would not stay down unless pushed really hard and then held for about 10 seconds. Even then, it would only toast once and then shut off for the next hour - making it impossible for more than one person to have anything toasted for breakfast. When I called Sunbeam for their warranty, I was told that I could get another one (NOT A REFUND) if I sent in another $8 for shipping but even then it might be ""refurbished""."
1,Horrible Experience,"Burned bread and melted plastic exterior, even at the lowest setting. Would not shut off automatically during second use. For practical and safety reasons, I would not recommend it at all."
2,Not what I was Expecting,"Mainly a collection of articles from Omni, many from the anti-matter section. Not a lot of depth to most of them, which is to be expected, since anti-matter was a collection of short articles about the paranormal. I was hoping for something along the lines of ""Shockingly Close to the Truth"" by Mosely, so we could get a deeper look at the investigative process, which is what I thought I was buying. I found it a bit dull, and can't recommend it."
3,Project Runway All-Stars . Season 1,Familiar characters from Project Runway series. Love to hate the same characters as you do on that series. Fashions are fun
3,As good as bronze,"Pendragon have enough studio savvy to make accessible progressive without alienating listeners turned off by conscious complexity. This EP is certainly not going to make or break anyone's collection, but those who like the syrupy intelligence that this band does best will find plenty of that here."
3,"Nice pictures, not very functional","When I get a big calendar, I expect it to be functional. There are lots of okay pictures, but if I had my pick I don't know if I would have picked half of them. And the actual calendar area is not white, but a dirty sand color, and is not all that big (taking up a little over half of the area it could take up), so I can't write as much as I'd like."
4,Actually fun to flip through,"This is a reverse dictionary with a lot of lists, charts, etc. Although it can be confusing to use, it is one of the best reference books I've seen for just flipping through. Lots of surprises and interesting facts tucked away in sidebars.While there is plenty of words and good relationships, I found its organization a bit difficult to use when needing to rapidly find a word. Saying that, it's also the one most often on my desk and not in the bookshelf with the others."
4,From the Word You Know to the One You Need,"This reference book offers a reverse method for finding the right word for thousands of words and phrases to describe people, places and things. Very helpful to any writer."
3,Do we really need this?,"This Flip Dictionary isn't something really new. And in some of the areas it covers, there are serious errors.It's probably unfair to ask one author, working by herself, to give us a book on the quality of, say, Roget's International Thesaurus a volume of over 1300 pages published by Thomas Y. Crowell and prepared by a large professional team building up on 150 years of scholarship and research.However, life isn't always ""fair."" When I write, I want to know that the information is comprehensive and reliable. I think Kipfer's book is a brave attempt and the design is contemporary and engaging. For my writing, I think I'll stick with time-proven Roget"
1,terrible graphics,"Paper quality is ok, but when it comes to the print itself (which is the most important feature on a poster) it's just a shame. Looks like a small jpg was blown up on photoshop and edited with lousy filters."
2,one of the worst books I've had to use,"I had to self teach myself math in college as I can't understand my professors. I've done this using the required textbook all the way through calculus 3. differential equations is my last class, but I can't understand this textbook at all at... it does a terrible job explaining everything, even things that would normally be simple concepts! I've been using a combination of youtube and other online resources to teach myself. anyone stuck with this textbook, do yourself a favor and use paul's online notes or something else online to learn."
3,More Novelty than Practicality,"The idea is great, but the execution could use some work. If the carpet it lands on is fluffy in any sense of the word it will just spin on its axle rather than speed off to hide. It's alarm, although better than the standard blare, is still quite annoying and loud, and if left un-silenced for more than 10 seconds it becomes a repetitive beep rather than the random sounds. It does work as an alarm clock, but beyond that it is still rather limited."
2,ehhh,mine broke after a week. Great idea for a product but needs to go back to the work shop.when it worked wasn't that great anyway... I say order it and you will find out for yourself
3,It's okay,This alarm clock is a okay product. I do wish it had more features on it. But it's pretty basic.
2,Clocky Review,It's cute but it still did not wake me up in the morning. The first night it did work but after the first night I did not hear the alarm go off.
2,Clocky Alarm Clock On Wheels In Almond,"So so - Bought for daughters dorm room - No reaction from her or roommate, so I assume not that amazing of an alarm clock."
1,May I suggest an alternative...,"A recent scientific breakthrough has spawned an alternative to Clocky. Using patented ""Put It Over There"" technology, you can now purchase a $15 alarm clock and just put it over there... across the room."
1,Fake product - DO NOT BUY,What was received was *not* a clocky alarm clock it was some crappy cheap knock-off product. Avoid buying from Amazon.
1,"Sold as a Clocky, however...","The Alarm clock was sold as a Clocky, however no where on the box, the instructons or on the alarm clock was the name Clocky. This appears to have been the cheap Chinese knock-off that I could have purchase anywhere for $11. Instead I was charged the full price of $33. I expected more buying through Amazon. The Amazon brand has been tarnished in my eyes."
1,"Low quality junk, slapped together somewhere in China","OK, the product is a funny idea, and I like personal robotics so I got one. Then I got a replacement. Then I got another replacement.So I have owned three Clockys. They have the following problems:3 of 3 clockys: brightly flash their backlight every time the minute changes. If this is a feature, it's a fatal flaw for an alarm clock. But I think it's a problem with the electronics.1 clocky: broken spring contact in the battery compartment made it impossible to turn on until I superglued another spring in place. Shouldn't this have been checked at the factory?1 clocky: screw holding battery compartment was stripped, very difficult to open.Dear Nanda: it's not enough to have a good idea. You have to be able to execute a product. Your product design and the manufacturing are both at fault here, and I'm not going to buy any future products from you."
4,Clocky is cool,"My daughter likes her new clocky. She always had hard time getting up in the morning. Now she has to get up and chase clocky. It rolls freely on hardwood floor, but doesn't go far on carpet."
5,Warning!If you think wheels are defective READ THIS REVIEW!!!,"Update:Please disregard my erroneous critical review claiming this item defective!!!!Please learn folks-EVERY TIME you change Clocky's batteries, you MUST set up the wheels! For example, if you want the wheels to go off RIGHT AWAY AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE ALARM GOES OFF, YOU MUST ,as per the manufacturer FAQ: ""Note that Clocky will not move until a minute after the snooze button has been pressed. THIS MAY BE CHANGED by pressing the 'a' button two times rapidly and then pressing the 'm' button to customize your Clocky's snooze time.try pressing the 'a' and 't' buttons on the top simultaneously to operate the test mode. If your Clocky is functioning properly the display would be on and the wheels will start to move.""I repeat: this item is wonderful and is working well!"
2,Too dang loud!,Its very 'cute' and well designed except for one major flaw. The sound level is not adjustable and its is way too loud for a day to day alarm clock unless you sleep with ear-plugs on!
3,Needs volume switch,Clocky. It is very cool looking and makes robot noises. My only complaint is that it is very loud and it would be helpful if it had a volume control switch.
5,It's awesome,"This product is really good. I just had it delievered today (an hour ago actually) and as soon as I got it, I tried it. It didn't come in like made in China like the other reviews have had. The box says Clocky, well bascially like the box it showed on the pictures. The clock of course came in as it shows on the pictures. I ordered the black one. The battery area was easy to unscrew, it took me no less than 5 minutes. The set up was easy and basic like you would see in a normal alarm clock. I of course looked at the directions just in case so I can do it right. It wasn't hard at all. Of course after I tried to activate the alarm (since this is the reason why I got it) and it wasn't so bad. It was pretty loud, can probably wake up the dead. It ran around my carpet like it's suppose to. Over all, I have no compaint in it (yet!). I will try this for sure tonight and see how it goes."
4,GREAT for teens,Our daughter is very hard to wake in the mornings. This clock has been the best thing for her !
4,Cute clock,"Clocky is a unique alarm clock with rubber wheels that will jump off of your night stand or where ever you want to put it. It makes R2D2 type noises and literally runs around your bedroom for about an hour banging here and there and turning in all directions.... and then it stops making noise. It's fairly loud, but not loud enough in my opinion and I have excellent hearing.I have to say that I do have to take meds to deal with sleeping and pain problems from old injuries.PROS: You can turn the wheels off and only use it as an alarm. Small design. Flashing lights.CONS: Eats up batteries quick. Back light turns off, so it's hard to read the time at night. It doesn't make noise long enough (more than 1 hr. or is loud enough.)Overall, I would recommend this to a friend. Clocky will do the job for most people. My 2 Yorkies didn't seem too distressed by it as it ran past their beds."
3,short-lived excitement,Love the design. The sound of the alarm works to wake up a heavy sleeper. But it stopped jumping off the bedside table and rolling away after only one month. That's a short shelf life!
4,Great product...,"When I first heard about it I searched the product up on YouTube to see it in action and it seemed to be pretty innovative so I decided to give it a try. After receiving my Clocky I must admit that it is very interactive and gets one to get up and chase after it (unless your space is crowded with things that block its way).The only reason I gave it four stars was because unfortunately, even after shutting off clocky (and a few others) I return back to sleep. My fault of course, but I wish that clocky perhaps moved a bit faster or that its moves were coordinated better as to avoid obstacles and avoid moving in the same direction (which makes it easier to catch)."
5,best gift for heavy sleeper,omg this is great jumps off the dresser and rolls under the bed making annoying beeping and horn noises if you have a snooze hitter this is the alarm clock for them..
5,Clocky is a hit!,We purchased this for a friend who is headed off to college. He sleeps like a log right through normal alarm clocks. He does not sleep through Mister Clocky rolling off the table and around the floor. Now he will have No Excuse for missing his morning classes.
5,AMAZING!!,I have tried so many different alarm clocks and this one actually works! I have to get up and get it which makes me frustrated and makes me wake up! I recommend it for anybody who has troubles waking up in the morning.
5,Perfect Gift for a Teenager,"My teenage grandson got a big smile on his face when he opened this for Christmas. As with most teens, he has a hard time getting in motion in the morning. Clocky WORKS."
1,"Too loud -- wakes up everyone in the house, not just the sleepyhead!","Cute but is WAY too loud and has no volume control!! It wakes up everyone in the house, not just the person it was intended for (who sleeps behind a closed door). Disappointed & will be returning it. It doesn't run around the room as advertised (stops when it hits a wall) but I don't really care about that... it's not really supposed to be entertaining, it's supposed to wake up a chronic oversleeper. The problem is that, as stated earlier, it wakes up everyone and that is a problem. Too bad it doesn't have volume control; if it did, it would be perfect. I don't recommend this unless it's for someone who lives alone OR lives in a BIG house with lots of insulation. I just about hit the ceiling the first time it went off... I don't like being shocked awake and having to adjust to my new heart rate. Pretty sure that would shorten my life span. LOLAnyway, sending it back. :("
2,Clocks doesn't run away.,The wheels don't turn. Don't know how to fix it. The color is nice. I need instruction on this matter.
5,the only thing that wakes me up,"What a great design. I think that this alarm clock is very creative and inventive. I set it on the floor away from the bed and when the alarm goes off, the fun begins. It wakes up the whole family. We keep it running until everyone is out of bed. Last one up turns it off. My dog loves it too. He wakes up ready to play which fills the room with fun in the morning instead of the normal grumpy mood I use to have."
1,Awful customer support from Nanda,"This was a fun and useful product until it broke (runs away, but stopped making any alarm sound). I was past the return period from the store where I bought it so I contacted Nanda for warranty service. And I contacted Nanda again. And I contacted Nanda again. I emailed them. I called them on the phone. I even wrote a letter (a real honest to goodness letter - you know, with a stamp). Every time I spoke to someone, they said they would have to get back in touch with me, but they never did. Always apologetic, but never solving the problem. It's too bad. They obviously are a small company and I was rooting for them. They don't seem to be run very well. Nanda, if you're listening, it's and I would still like a working Clocky. Nanda's customer support is awful. It's hard to recommend Clocky for this reason."
1,Slow to Respond,"I ordered this clock for a friend's birthday present. When it arrived it was not exactly what I wanted. I tried for a while to get the company's return instructions, finally got them, returned the clock but have never been refunded the purchase price. Not satisfied with this business."
1,Has never even turned on,"I bought this for a January birthday present and found out yesterday that it has never worked, never even turned on once. It's a piece of junk."

They obviously are a small company and I was rooting for them. They don't seem to be run very well. Nanda, if you're listening, it's and I would still like a working Clocky. Nanda's customer support is awful. It's hard to recommend Clocky for this reason."
3,alarm clock,"For the price the clock is a nice looking, interesting design. I had hopped it pulled some funny gag when the alarm goes off like maybe rolling around the desk. But, for practicality and it's real use a good choice"
3,Good Idea,"I was thinking about buying clocky because i would be able to get out of bed easier if i had to chase my alarm clock. I changed my mind though. Instead of buying clocky, i'm just going to put my current alarm clock somewhere in my room so that i have to get up to get it when the alarm goes off. I know regular alarm clocks don't run around like clocky but if you put it out of reach you still have to get up to get it. That's enough to get me up. I guess if you really need it to get up it's worth it, but i'm sticking to my plan."
2,color is wrong,"Instead of the pretty red/pink color in the picture, it's a pepto bismol pink. The wheels looked as if they had been used (black scuffs on the white tires).I waited for awhile for this to ship from China and I don't want to deal with the hassle of sending it back. I haven't tried the clock function but I am already disappointed.--editIt doesn't run away far because of the carpet. My carpet is not that fluffy just the regular ones you find in a normal home.Also, the alarm is not that loud.Cons:-shipping took longer because it came from China-color is really off-doesn't roll around the carpet well-expensivePro:-the alarm sound is pretty uniqueoverall:do not buy if you have carpet in your room & i would go with a different color than ""raspberry"" because you will get a very girly bubble gum pink"
2,no better than the average alarm clock,"I am a heavy sleeper that struggles to get up in the morning. After reading about ""Clocky"" I felt certain that this alarm would do the trick. Unfortunately I found it to be no better than any average alarm clock. In theory this is how it works: when the alarm goes off, ""Clocky"" rolls off of whatever surface you put it on, then proceeds to roll and spin around the floor, so that you have to physically get up and get it. However, I found that at times clocky did not even roll off of the nightstand and would instead knock things off the nightstand. When it does roll off the nightstand, it does not roll very far away from the bed (which was the main problem) and I was generally able to grab clocky and snooze without getting out of bed. I found that I am better off putting an alarm in my bathroom (that adjoins my room) so that I have to physically get out of bed."
1,buy somewhere else,"This is the not the right product. It's not ""Clocky"" and it's not by Nanda Home. LilGift, LLC has sent a knock-off product. I'm very upset because I didn't pay the ""Clocky"" price to get a cheap generic. I read other reviews and was aware that other people experienced this but I assumed Amazon wouldn't let the scam continue because the description very specifically says Clocky by Nanda Home. This was suppose to be a gift but I'm too embarassed to give it - the packaging is cheap looking and doesn't even have proper English ""The alarm clock that runs aways to get you out of bed."" Overall, pathetic. And the worst part is, I love ordering from Amazon but I feel that they should be able to police and correct these scams to protect consumers like me, so I feel let down."
1,Stopped working the first morning!,"We just received our chrome clocky yesterday. We put the batteries in, made sure it worked, tested the functions, and placed it on a regular 1.5 ft bedroom nightstand over heavy carpeting. Next morning, it rang, snoozed, jumped on the carpet from 1.5 ft in the clear, and went totally dead. Checked the batteries; still nothing.We thought our $59 would last longer than one evening! We emailed Nanda for replacement but based on the previous posting, we are better off returning it ..."
1,Received Chinese Knockoff - Don't Buy from Seller Outside Amazon!,"So I bought a ""Clocky"" since I've always wanted one and they were having a deal with New Harbor. It was about 12.50 each, so I bought two thinking I could use it as gag gifts for friends this winter. However, I was very dissapointed when i received my packaging - they were two cheap knock-off's called ""Alarm Clock"". I immediately sent a message to New Harbor and asked for a refund. They refunded my account $25 and said I didn't have to send the alarm clocks back.Just be wary - buy only from an amazon seller!"
1,too difficult to turn off,"my son says it is too difficult to turn off, he had to unscrew the back to take out the battery. So he is using his cell phone alarm again."
5,Cute!,Great for people who have a hard time waking. Really cute clock! Enjoyed by the person who received it as a gift.
3,BETTER ENGLISH PLEASE...,"I am one of those people who often needs at least two alarm clocks (and two cats ordering breakfast) to get my butt out of bed in the morning. So, when I read about Clocky in a column from another source, I thought it might be a good idea and ordered it.The problem is the pamphlet (instructions) that came in the box are extremely poorly translated and very difficult to understand. What is not addressed, or at least I couldn't find it, is how to set the alarm for AM or PM. As it is now, Clocky is going off at 4:50 P.M. This is not helping me get the 7:12 A.M. train to NY.Has anyone figured this AM/PM thing out? Any help would be appreciated!"
4,a playful way to wake up,"Clocky is a great answer for anyone who has trouble getting up in the morning. He's cute and little, but seems to have a devious mind when it comes to lulling people out of the covers. The clock is not as quick as I thought it might have been, but maybe that's appropriate for the mornings- and my little sister never seems to reach him before he heads under her bed. Great gift for those guilty of hitting snooze!"
2,Too impractical.,"I got this for Christmas, hoping my kids would like the novelty; just 1 of them liked it. I ended up returning the other two."
1,No movement,It rings but does not move. I have sent 3 emails to Nanda Home and they have not responded.I am regretting buying this product.
3,Clocky is nice if you don't need to change the batteries.,I received a clocky in 2008 for Christmas but after the batteries died and I went to change them even with the pull strap they didn't come out easily. Once they finally did come out they bent the springs and the opposite end with the plates were awkwardly bent as well. I tried putting new batteries in and after ten minutes of struggle without it turning on and trying to push the battery in carefully one of them broke and started leaking.It's an awesome alarm clock but they really should make the battery compartment easier to deal with. Maybe I was just unlucky with mine. I would get another but the price is a bit high.
3,cute and fun,"its a fun, cute little clock that is loud enough to definitely wake you, but it has a button to turn the wheels off which kind of defeats the purpose off forcing someone to get out of bed in order to actually wake up and not just hit snooze."
4,Great gift!,"Clocky was the perfect gift for both my elementary-school-age grandaughters. It is fun and cute in their favorite colors and they can now get themselves up for school, soccer, whatever, without Mom or Dad prodding them."
3,Wake up!,Great for people who oversleep and do not respond to regular alarm clock Problem for apartment dwellers as it is very loud and annoying and can be heard through to adjacent apartment.
1,Terrible Knock Off!!!!,"Cheap knock off!!! It was advertised as a Clocky, so I figured it must really be a Clocky, right? Nope, I was WRONG!!! I ordered three as (silly) gifts, but I'd honestly be embarrassed to give this to someone. The raspberry color is definitely pepto bismol/bubble gum pink. The almond colored one is in a pink box.... and the box says ""alarm clock"". Definitely a piece of junk!! These shouldn't be advertised as something they are not!I contacted the seller right away, and they responded by saying they will refund my entire purchase price.Save your $$$!!!!!!"
1,Buyer Beware,"When I purchased this as a gift for my sister I was careful to look for a Clocky made by Nanda. After reading very carefully over the description (the whole page, really) I made the order with the assurance that I was ordering an original Clocky. When the package came today I immediately noticed that it was not, in fact, a Nanda product but was a cheap knock-off product that does not look like it would last long at all. I give Amazon credit for a quick return process. Within 30 minutes of having found that this product was NOT what I was expecting I had the fake Clocky-like-item packed up, labeled, and ready to mail. I would recommend that you not order this unless there is a way to truly determine that you are getting the genuine article."
5,I LOVE CLOCKY,"THIS THING GETS ME UP EVERY MORNING! It has trained me. I am a machine. Rain or shine, 6 hours of sleep or 10 hours of sleep, I get up every morning and hunt around for this baby under my bed and around my room. Afterwords it is physically impossible for me to fall back asleep. You do build up a resistance to it's annoying alarm sounds over time though, which is something you might potentially want to be aware of."
2,"good alarm sound, but that's about it","I'm not sure how solidly-made this is. Since it jumps off your nightstand, you'd better not have a linoleum or wooden floor: it think it would break before long.I would also like to point out that Clocky runs around in random directions for only about 15 seconds. After that it stops and merely beeps crazily in place.Why don't you just put your alarm clock in the bathroom instead? That way you have to get up and walk some distance to turn it off."
1,Pathetic,HiI wanted the clocky alarm clock from Nanda company. You guys at Amazon.com have sent me a cheap Chinese made clocky alarm clock which must be selling in China for 1-2 dollars. I still have not used the stuff as the time keeps flashing and I am not able to go beyond that.Naresh
1,Single-use alarm clock,"The aqua clocky is adorable, but the electronic beeps and boops are a little too ""E.T."" at 6:00 am...it's not enough that you have to chase it, you're also pretty sure its signaling the start of the War of the Worlds. Fortunately, I only had to tolerate this rude awakening once, since the first time clocky rolled off the counter, it shattered, and has not worked since."
1,Go to a gift store better than paying $75 to get this product.,Low quality for tooooooo much price. What is that product that I can pay 59.99 price + 14.99 shipping fee? I'm not a stupid to pay 75 bucks for it?!!!
1,Clocky can't tell time!,"The first thing you're struck by is how small it is compared to the pictures. The second thing is the difficulty in programming, and finally, it just sits there, the wheels never turned, and the alarm only went off sporadically."
2,It broke within a month,"I bought clocky to make sure I woke up for my new job (when the phone runs out of battery in the middle of the night!).Pros:Cute!Always woke me upMade me get out of bed to turn it offSuper easy to set time and alarmCons:The wheels don't work anymore so it doesn't run away. They just stopped working one day.It is too easy to accidentally turn the alarm off instead of snoozing, or accidentally change the time.So loud I was a bit worried that it would wake my roommates in other rooms."
2,not as cool as i thought,"i think we all have the same problem which is why we bought this alarm. I expected this alarm to be a cure for my affinity for hitting snooze but since i live with two other people i tend to turn it off once it goes off. i wish it was harder to shut off the alarm instead of hitting the bell sign. but simplicity is a virtue and I am expecting too much from a crawling alarm. EDIT: About two months into the clocky's life, it would reset to 12 AM at random times. I made sure the batteries were charged and the battery cover was screwed on tightly but it still persists. I'm sad because I just burnt $30 bucks for an adorably useless alarm. I passed my warranty/return period a long time ago so maybe when I become an engineer I can retool its life into sponge so it can roll and wipe my counters."
3,Effective but too easy to turn alarm off,"Let me first say that the alarm does wake you up. Purchased the alarm for my 14 year old son who is not a morning person. I loved the idea of an alarm clock that woke him up and should he go back to sleep would make sure that he woke up. However, my dreams of having him wake back up rest solely on him hitting the snooze button - something that he learned after one night was not something he wanted to do. Now, he simply turns the alarm off instead of hitting the snooze and goes back to sleep. Clocky only rolls around the room after the snooze time expires.My wish is that the process of turning the alarm off were a little more complicated than simply touching a button on the front of the device.Have no doubt, this item does do what it says and it does indeed wake you up."
4,Oh clockly....,"Oh clocky... sigh... you end up having a love hate relationship with this guy. He works as described however I think its a little cheap feeling, I think its the buttons. Also.... either its broken or I don't know how to use the snooze button... it doesn't snooze... he just runs around screaming and I smack him and he refuses to die. Regardless take my word for it, he works. Seeing as I purchased clocky in the first place it should seem obvious I have a waking up problem but clocky does the trick I wake up and try and catch him before he runs off. This is a good purchase. It works and has not broken from any tall heights. I leave him on the floor just in case since snooze don't work anyway. I suggest this product for anyone who has trouble waking up! THIS WILL DO THE TRICK!"
1,Clocky Knockoff,"This product is a knockoff. It doesn't even say Clocky anywhere on the box, yet they're charging Clocky brand-name price. I think that's fraud."
1,IF SOLD BY LILGIFT ITS A KNOCK OFF,"the ALMOND colored one sold by LilGift is a KNOCK OFF! I cannot speak to the other ones sold by Amazon or other sellers.I'm very disappointed with Amazon for not vetting this seller and their products properly. I did NOT receive a Clocky Alarm clock but instead received a VERY CHEAP KNOCK-OFF. This has really shaken my trust in Amazon, and I feel that I know need to be careful in future purchases. No more blind trust on my end.To add insult to injury, after returning the item and explicitly telling Amazon customer service over the phone about 2-3 weeks ago that it is a knock off, and pointing out other reviews that say they also received knock-offs, IT IS STILL BEING SOLD.Amazon should drop this product and this seller."
1,Knock off,I can't believe it's THIS close to Christmas and I got a fake knock off. It's a waste of time and a hassle.
3,"Very small, good novelty value.","I was surprised at how small this product is. It definitely is a crowd pleaser and my young boys love it (the named it R2D2) . The clock face does not sit at a normal angle, making it harder to read when looked at on level or below level. Instructions say not to place it above 3 feet, which is fine for most bedside tables but not all. I am not sure how long it would last if we used it daily, it seems a bit flimsy, but so far so good. If you can buy it for $20 or so I would say go for it."
2,Definitely a knock-off,"Well, i received my clock and it is definitely a Clocky counterfeit. I would be pretty pissed if i was paying the $40 or $50 the clocks are currently set at, but i'm not too upset because i bought it when it was on some weird sale so i only paid $7.50 for the thing (also, i had been forewarned that others had received fake clockys). I am annoyed, however, that they claimed authenticity. At any rate, i see my $7.50 faux-Clocky as a good experiment to see if Clocky would work for me without being out $40 if it doesn't.Edit: This broke 2 days after i wrote the review (ie after 8 days of use). One of the wheels broke apart. I did like it for those 8 days, though. If you are interested in this clock i would recommend buying one from a bricks-and-mortar store where you can be assured of its authenticity and you can return it if it breaks."
1,Broke on first try,"The first time we tried this, the wheel broke off. Cool idea, needs to be made better. I was going to buy another one for a christmas present, glad I only bought one. Will return."
5,Great product,This is a fun alarm clock. II got the almond colored one ($7.99) where as the chrome one was $47. It runs around making r2d2 sounds and the cat doesn't know what to think!
1,Terrible print quality!,"Caveat emptor -- Amazon is shipping ""on-demand reprint"" editions of this book, without warning. My copy seriously looks like it was printed at Kinkos on an aging black and white copier. Maybe it's a good book--I don't know, the quality bugs me so much I haven't even started it--but you should probably consider buying it from someplace that won't sell you an edition that was apparently printed in the back room of a crack house in Jersey."
5,"Smart, useful and concise - just what I needed!","This book gives a lot of practical, common-sense advice that will either give you a new perspective - or validate your instincts. All the ideas are very well organized and makes it easy to use as a reference."
4,Did not receive the pictured item,"The book arrived on time. The packaging was not great,the jacket and cover were missing,has highlighting on some pages (description did not say these things). Had to recheck the ISBN and year of publication to confirm that it was the right book. The book received was not the book pictured."
2,Not particularly nice or impressive...,"Recommended use: I bought this to use as a paperweight on my office desk, but it sort of looks cheap, so I gave up on that use and instead gifted it to an old girlfriend from Clemson U. The novelty of gifting a big diamond with the Clemson logo is probably this item's highest and best use.Cons: The gift box was extremely cheap (was falling apart). Looking at the picture online, I thought the paw was embedded in or behind the glass, but no: The and the tiger paw on paperweight itself is basically just a sticker, and on my item the paw had a visible scratch through it. It's really too big to have laying around on one's desk."
5,Classic!,"""Live at The Mint"" smokes with some great renditions of ""Cross Cut Saw"" and ""Dust My Broom"", plus some great originals like the instrumental ""Hard Candy"" and my favorite song on this disc ""Bad Bad Pain"", a guest appearance by his father on his song ""Well Well Well"" is a delight but the 18 min version of ""Hoochie Coochie Man"" just pulls out all the stops as Duwayne really shines and shows total command of his instrument and of the audience. Now I know why the North Mississippi Allstars keep putting this guy on stage every chance they get. This CD may be hard to find, but if you can get a hold of a copy then you got a real rock n' roll/blues classic on your hands!Reviewed by The Banditwww.banditbluesradio.com"
5,I love this CD,"I just bought this cd on amazon.com. It is a classic. I discovered it when XM radio played Well Well Well. I bought it that same day. If you love blues with the guitar being the main force, this cd is for you. I can't believe this is the only cd sold on Amazon by Duwayne Burnside.Hint...go to his website."
4,the end of much more floppies,"i thik it will be the furure case to all of you thin , capacities & connectivities are the plus"
3,Decent,"This album contains many of the Dead's popular songs, and it was the first album that I bought when I started listening to this band. However, it does not have many of their best songs. For a better listening experience and a more representative sample of the Grateful Dead, try ""The Very Best of the Grateful Dead"", ""American Beauty"", or ""Workingman's Dead"". Any of these three are far, far better than this album, and in my opinion, ""American Beauty"" is nearly perfect. It is a GREAT album."
3,"Classic songs, so-so collection.","Chances are, if your reading this review your looking for one ""best"" Grateful Dead cd, compilation or not. Even if this was twice as long you would still be missing many essential Dead tracks. However, if you really do want just one disc, the newer ""Very Best of Grateful Dead"" is better than this. It has 17 remastered tracks, some that are missing here. Of course what's on here is all great. There is also the ""What a long strange trip it's been"" best of. That's 2 discs but needs remastering bad. If you wanted just ONE live disc, which is hard to come by, I would suggest ""Dead Set"". That's a good 14 track selection. You could always just get one of the classic studio albums. Of those, my favorites are ""American Beauty"", ""Mars Hotel"", and ""Workingman's Dead"", in that order. Just remember, when in doubt, play Dead."
3,Arturo Sandoval's Live Brew,"This DVD features Arturo's fiery playing with some band in UK. The synthesis of the ensemble is quite good but the lighting and the dresscode (owing to the fact the concert was recorded in 1992), was quite dodgy. Sound quality is good, being able to witness Arturo's skills from A to Z. Nevertheless, the entire runtime of the video is not too long though as the video only featured the performance bits of the concert, excluding the speeches and everything else. Overall, it's quite a good buy if you want to see Arturo burning it up on the trumpet, flugelhorn and piano."
2,Mattress w/ holes!,"If I still had the receipt I would return it!We bought it for an upcoming camping event. It went straight from the box it came in, into our vehicle. We inflated it at the camp site, only to discover a rather loud hissing noise coming out of the side wall. It would stay inflated for about an hour, then we would have to reinflate. It was a rough night!"
5,Particularly lovely,"I enjoyed this book. Not knowing what to expect, my husband and I read each of the four stories individually. After finishing one we'd start over and begin with another. Macauley should be lauded for the different modes of art he employs, if nothing else. The watercolor illustrations of a boy on a train differ nicely from the pen and ink drawings of the two kids and their crazy parents. Most enjoyable, perhaps, is the series of train station commuters, waiting for the train and slowly going mad. Kids will enjoy following the escaped criminal (complete with black mask and black & white striped shirt) as he runs from story to story throughout the book. This would not read especially well to a large group of children, seeing as how the pictures are particularly small and difficult to follow from a distance. Also some of these stories lack words altogether. But individual children will enjoy finding new and different details in each of the four tales. Altogether, a fascinating book."
5,A beautiful interplay of four stories.,"A small book for young children containing of four stories told in illustrated panels in which the stories are all interlocked into one set. Beautifully prepared, it was awarded the 1991 Caldecott Medal for best illustrations in a book for children. Children should enjoy this book time and time again."
1,D:,"I CAN'T SEE HOW ON EARTH THIS IS READABLE FOR ANYONE ON THEIR KINDLE! is the sample faulty? or is it easier on the newer kindles? it's not at all what i expected, and i'm not buying it."
3,Not so Black and White,"I thought this book was very innovative in the way that Macaulay had four different stories within the book that evenutally tied all into one. He also used different illustration techniques for each story. There are four panes with each different story illustrated in one. With that, there was also different fonts for the different stories. The complaint I have about the book is that it is very confusing, even for me so I could imagine younger children wouldn't understand it at all. The idea was good but it's just a difficult concept for children."
4,nice one,"there are lots of hot girls as well as new girls and there is a hot bonus part. I have lots of gwwild dvds, I think it is one of the best 10 dvds and deserves to be watched"
3,Pretty Good Lamp,"I bought this lamp for my son's desk and it pretty much does the job. Couple of things, though: (1) even a 40 watt bulb makes the plastic pretty hot and (2) the switch located on the back that turns the light on and off is very stiff. Half the time, I have to remove the metal cover over the switch to turn the lamp off. But, all in all, I am happy with the purchase. It is pretty heavy-duty and doesn't fall over, which is good."
3,"Okay, good...but where is Parts 2/3/4...??","I must admit, this ""kids"" version of learning Electronics is good...but where did the publisher think that continuation on the subject was going...without a Part 2, 3, 4;etc??Lighting a bulb up with a battery is nice, but creating a series on the subject would be far better...than taking the money and running away~!Showing the public a ""kids"" DVD version of complex subjects (instead of junk books like ""made easy or dummies"" series) is a topic waiting for the right creator...."
5,Beautiful presentation of letters,"Ths book is a beautiful one...each letter is unique, in both voice and presentation. Some are reproductions of originals, by the author's hand, so that you can see pauses, underlines, and bold strokes. All are touching, and remind us of love's power and occasionally, power to destroy."
4,High quality battery,"Battery lasted approximately three years with moderate use. It fails to hold a charge now, but I left it discharged for an extended period. Upon disassembly, I was pleased to see that the cells are Panasonic, and of Japanese origin. Ordering another."
1,not water proof,"This is the second Timex ""water proof"" watch that is not. I just returned from backpacking and white water rafting. Water damaged the watch, which no longer works. Look elsewhere if you depend on a watch in the backcountry."
1,Not Waterproof so not really for Triathlon use,"I've had very bad luck with recent Timex Ironman watches--this model in particular. I've purchased seven of them in the past five years (which includes two for my kids), and they have all allowed water to seep in when swimming. We're talking about 2 or 3 feet deep in the local pool, not anywhere near the 100 meter depth at which these claim to be waterproof. I was able to return several, thinking that it might just be a bad batch or a fluke, but it's happened on each one over time. I don't know if Timex changed their manufacturing process or location, but these are useless now if you ever intend to go near the water with them."
2,Too bulky,"This microwaveable heating pad is just too bulky and heavy to stay up on my neck, but sets on my shoulders instead. I needed something for my NECK."
5,Wowww,"I just want to say I have been reading alot of Ellora's Cave books (which includes many wonderful writers) and the Lunewulf series was great. I have really enjoyed it and would say it is a ""must"" read."
2,Product description missing information,"Product has not been tested for compatibility with Microsoft Windows operating systems through use of Microsoft-provided testing procedures. Product does not display the Designed for Microsoft Windows XP logo showing it has been tested for compatibility with Microsoft Windows operating systems through use of Microsoft-provided testing procedures. Installation on Windows XP is not recommended by Microsoft. I called M-Audio for advice and they said they do not participate in these testings and had an ""I don't care"" attitude whether we used this product or not."
1,Principles of CPT coding,"The majority of my complaint is my own fault, I didn't notice that this was a 2003 edition (which was shown by seller). The problem is, this book has no value to ANYONE. CPT codes need to be current. This book is outdated and cannot be used for coding. Why sell it? The only people would would buy this are people who don't realize that the book they are buying cannot be used. Many of the codes have been changed/deleted. Anyone using this for a study guide had better not take the coding exam after using this book. Your answers will be wrong. PLEASE DON'T SELL SOMETHING THAT HAS NO USE. To sell this is taking advantage of someone. The seller is aware that the book is outdated."
2,outdated and incomplete list.,"I bought this survey, because I thought it would be a handy reference for my freshwater fish collecting activities in Guatemala. This item to me is almost useless, because it only lists the most common fish and very few of them. Nor does it tell me where to find them.The only use I get out of it, is that it gives local names for a number of the creatures listed."
1,Waste o' Money!,"Let's cut to the chase: This is a baaaad product! The only reason it gets one star is that's as low as I can go! Don't be sucked in by the compact concept, mine stopped spinning after a coupla weeks...no spin, no good!"
2,THIS THING IS A PIECE OF JUNK!!,"This is my first instance of really getting stung by an Amazon vendor. I fully expected this to be a nice, sturdy, presentable CD/DVD stacker...it turned out to be the FLIMSIEST piece of <<censored>> I've ever spent a substantial two digit amount 'o' bucks on! The two racks I ordered cost me, with shipping, over FORTY DOLLARS!! After I got them, put one of them together and assessed it, I was amazed at how tacky and cheap it looked and felt! I went to tighten the base to the top cap and the cap promptly broke, with very little exertion on my part! It also doesn't hold DVDs, just CDs!I wouldn't recommend either the device OR the vendor to a dog that has a Yorx home entertainment system! YUCK!(And thank Amazon for straightening things out concerning this!)"
3,Considerable assembly required.....,"What the picture of the CD/DVD Spinner Rack DOESN'T tell you is that it arrives in approximately 23 pieces with nothing but a very basic line drawing to guide you through the assembly. Because it is fundamentally a piece of cheap, plastic, um, stuff, (and what else did I expect for the very reasonable price?) getting all the round pegs through the squarish holes took some doing. I am NOT a moron, but it took me fully 2 1/2 hours to get this product assembled -- if you try it yourself, you will see that it is the last step that gets you. I gave it three stars, however, because once it was put together, it appears sturdy and quite capable of doing what it is designed to do: i.e. hold 80 CDs..."
2,Frustrating,"I love the way this model looks, but......The battery life is atrocious!I have had to change batteries 3 times in 14 months!!Also, it takes an advanced degree to set the time.Without these flaws, it would be a 5 star watch and rating.The frustration level has driven me to look for a replacement."
1,Tacky and Crass,"That book was not written well at all! I found the language in this book to be crude and out of place! And I don't know anyone that would talk to thier boss as Sylvia does.......(whether or not if they are friends) There is nothing wrong about having sex or bad language in a book but I just didn't like her style. I love Brenda Jackson, Francis Ray and Zane so I guess maybe that is why I was not happy. Basically if you are looking for a book with some substance do not purchase this one or you will be mad."
1,"Please, don't waste your time nor money","First I was delighted that the author gave credit to the Lord Jesus so stupidly I assumed this book would have some redeeming value. Boy was I wrong, from the beginning to the end it was filled with the most foul and unnecessarily gross language. A good author can do a love scene without being gross. This lady is gross and the conversations between the characters is punctuated with swearing. I've read excellent books that have a flowing and still entertaining dialogue...yes, cursing is sprinkled here and there...this was not a sprinkling it was a downpour. If the words with ""F"" and ""M..F"", ""P"" and ""S"" ""D"" are the only ones you can use to fill your book then lady you CAN'T WRITE!!"
2,Okay...,"This book was okay...I would still recommend it, because the story does take off with a kick, but it sort of gets away from you in the middle. I finally finished it after a week. Normally I finish very good books in anywhere from 24 to 48 hours. However, I must say still pick one up, the author is very talented, I've read two other books by her, this was definitely not my favorite."
5,Good product,Works great for resurfacing your skin. Leaves it feeling smooth and soft and very clean.Great for using before night time moisturizer.
2,Great magazine if you're looking for a tummy tuck and a lawyer,"I first subscribed to Baltimore Magazine because I was attracted to the many different places around Baltimore they reviewed. Since then, I've been completely put off by the sheer amount of advertising that they put in the magazine. The last issue I just received had a 19-page advertisement for cosmetic surgery followed by a 39 page (not a typo...39 FULL CONSECUTIVE PAGES) advertisement for lawyers. It's gotten to the point where I can't even flip through the magazine anymore. I have to turn and scour each page to find the real content now. Needless to say, I won't be renewing my subscription anymore."
1,More ads then your magazine has room for,"I picked up this magazine, as I'm sure many people will, because of the current issue (May 2010) with the big words ""FREE - 159 Things To Do This Summer"" plastered all over the front. I thought, hey, great! What a great feature article, for everyone looking for a cheap way to get out and see their city. When I first picked it up, before I read any of the magazine, I was thinking it would be nice to subscribe.No.The subscription price is ridiculously low because of the millions of ads. You will not go one two pages without hitting an ad. The feature story was mediocre, and you can find their information on the magazine's website.In short: Don't bother subscribing, any information that's worth getting is on their website."

4,Yeminite Song and Dance Men,"In the 1990s, producer, Gerard Kremer, with the aid of ethnomusicologist, Habib Yammine, visited the uplands of Yemen, particulary the city Sanaa, with a digital recorder, and found some worthy public events and willing musicians. Their album, part of the budget Air Mail Music series, consists in the main of field recordings. Beginning with early morning muezzins calling from loudspeakers, the series of pieces alternate with oud-accompanied songs and male dance rhythms beat on large metal cans and trays or, later, with drums and double-reeded shawms. As with most field work, the music is raw, hard, and vital. The listener does feel as if walking on some street hearing a musical ensemble. The tunes and rhythms, while having the common Arabic core structure, reflect the social geography of an ancient maritime trader of the Indian Ocean and Red Sea."
5,Extremely Helpful,"This book gives excellent insight to the practical issues associated with data quality. The book gives some great suggesions on how businesses can improve performance through a focused approach to managing information. I enjoyed reading it, and have actually begun to use some of the ideas presented in the book in my current job."
2,Fluffy,"""Practitioner's guide to data quality improvement"" by David Loshin would be a better choice. Here, the perspective is one of a management consultant rather than a data professional. The book is replete with gratuitous lists and diagrams (see section 15, for example - PowerPoint slides looking for a new home?), is verbose and rather disorganized. When you ""condense"" the contents, an already thin book gets much thinner. Still insightful and useful, but you have better options."
5,Data Quality: The Field Guide by Redman,Data Quality: The Field Guide is a great basic book that describes issues involved with data quality and offers ideas for improvement. The book explains why a business should care about the quality of their data and provides context for discussions that should resonate with business management. Ideas are clearly stated. I look forward to applying the concepts.
3,Arch satire about a Minister who was a dog in a past life!,"This is an entertaining read but not one of my favorite Dunsany's! The writing is delightful as always and the outre tale is consistently dottily amusing, it just isn't the grand fantasy Dunsany could do so well. A London clubman discovers that when slightly drunk a Dean drifts into a reminiscent mood - but what the Dean reminisces ABOUT is his previous incarnation - he was the family dog on a country estate! A very clever novel in its own way."
1,POS,"I had the wine cellar for less than 3 months when it just stopped working. I thought it was just the outlet but I tried it in 2 other ones and it just won't turn back on. I had received it as a gift from [...] and it was already out of the warranty period by the time I got it. I know I didn't pay for it but I am still upset. Don't buy, even if it's a good deal."
2,Not so cool,"My unit says 2006 but I think I bought it later. Like others have said, it never really did cool the wine. The red and white settings were virtually the same. About 6 mos ago it started making a groaning sound. I thought it was dust in the fan so I cleaned it out and it stopped. Now the entire fan has stopped. After reading other reviews, it would cost too much to fix compared to the purchase price. I'm sorry because it fit perfectly under my cabinet in the butler's panty!! Not sure if it's the model or the maker..."
1,Haier as a manufacturer,"I received a twelve bottle Haier wine cellar for Christmas in 2008 from my daughter. It quit working within 18 months. When I called the 800 number listed in my owner's manual, I was told the warranty is for 12 months and it would be cheaper for me to purchase a new one. I told them the warranty specifies, parts and labor for twelve months and parts only for an additional twelve months. The representative stated that she did not care what the booklet said, the warranty is twelve months, period.This summer I purchased a new dehumidifier and while researching, the name Haier did not come with good reviews. Needless to say, I did not purchase one of their units. You get what you pay for with Haier, go cheap but be prepared to purchase often."
3,Its alright I guess...,"A few things I have to say, the refrigerator is okay. Remember, I wasnt paying $500.00 for a mini wine cooler but I also expected a little more. The company processed the order quickly and shipped it quickly. However the carrier just left it on the front door where someone could have walked away with it. That would really suck since it was a house warming gift. I did mention this to the supplier and they will look into it. Never heard back. LOL! Didn't expect them to get back though."
1,Binocular review,Difficult to read and wordy. More like a reference than a book. Optics should not be made more difficult to understand but this book managed to do just that.
1,I didn't like this book!,This book is inaccurate and has typos. The author realizes this and is making a new updated addition for this book. There are better books on binocular vision. My recommendation is to buy another binocular vision book!
4,A Look at the Lincoln Legend,"The research into this book is incredible. The stories of the court martials is enjoyable reading, though at times the stories become repetitive (thus the 4 stars and not 5). Lincoln the compassionate president is examined carefully through these court martial cases and in the final chapter. The final chapter, is a great look at Lincoln and his place in history."
2,The best side of Lincoln,"If you're looking for the best of Lincoln, and avoiding unbiased books, this one is for you. This book paints Lincoln as the most caring person imaginable.Of course the title is ""Don't shoot that boy""; which only focus on 'good' things Lincoln did.If you're doing research on Lincoln's good qualities, this book is a good source. But it you want unbaised book, look elsewhere.It's a fast reading book, that lives up to the 'myth' of Lincoln."
5,David Foster Wallace if he was a she...,"...except that Jane Cassady is completely different. Cassady uses Post-modernistic images that evoke Kant, the Confessional Poets and pop music in such a way as to make the outrageous metaphoric leaps and connections herein seem completely logical. There is a literateness to her work that belays the fact that most poets who would dare reference Pretty in Pink and the Cure are basically shallow. Cassady is not. Cassady may well be one of tomorrows poetic greats."
2,very disappointed,Did not like anything about how this was orchestrated no the style or choice of selections.Thank you Bon Jour ciao
5,ELIXIR for your doomsday soul,"When feeling bleak, meek, or weak, listen to elixir. Be cradled by the dark, dreary bass. Let the elephants lumber 'round you in a circle.A nice surprise is the Texas INstrument nods used very appropriately."
1,"Not a true documentary, unauthorized",No where in the description did it disclose that this was an unauthorized documentary...Not until you put in the DVD does it say that it contains NO original Bon Jovi music and it is an unauthorized documentary..Definatley NOT worth the 20$$!!!!It is not autentic!!
5,Lovely works by little known Lekeu,"Belgian-born Lekeu, a student of both Franck and D'Indy, composed these pieces between 1887 and 1892. The first, written the year of his 17th birthday, is a somber but most affecting work. The other instrumental pieces, while occasionally more spirited, also have an undercurrent of yearning if not pathos. The Larghetto, my personal favorite, is exceptionally beautiful and all are played with feeling and care. The three Poemes, giving musical voice to a work each of Lamartine, Verlaine, and Hugo, are lovingly performed by Rachel Yakar. Sadly, Lekeu died the day following his 24th birthday."
2,Tried really hard to like it!,"I have dry skin & read great reviews about this cleanser. However, when I tried it, it felt slightly irritating and smelled a lot like bug spray."
5,The best cleanser in the world!,"I have combination normal/oily skin, and I have been using Philosophy skin care for about a month. I wear make-up every day, and Purity Made Simple easily removes all my makeup (including mascara) and leaves my skin feeling clean. With the product I was using before, I had to apply eye makeup remover and then use a cleanser. This product gets rid of all of it and doesn't irritate my eyes. (NOTE: I do not use waterproof mascara, so I'm not sure if it would remove that without irritation.) I love the smell; it's very clean. A little goes a long way. You can really feel it dissolving your makeup, and it leaves your skin oil-free."
1,Dries out my skin,"After reading the other reviews I thought this would be a great facial cleanser. Unfortunately, it just dried out my skin. Which is odd because my skin is oily and it takes a lot to dry it out. I am glad I only bought the small size."
3,It's Okay,Does not dissolve makeup as it says. Have used other facial cleansers that work better. Somewhat disappointed in this product.
5,LOVE THIS STUFF,"I received this product a few years ago as a gift. It was amazing. It is great on your face and no greasy feeling. Very subtle smell, if any. Cleans makeup off in a flash, even eye makeup. It does it all and is so gentle on my eyes. Love it, love it, love it!"
5,Smooth Skin,The product does a great job of cleansing without drying out my skin.I love the smell of the product too!
1,Utterly Disappointed!,"I am just SO DISAPPOINTED! After all of the rave reviews on this product I really thought it was going to be great to use. However, it was awful, it made me break out badly and did not remove eye make up. I am overall really disappointed with all of the Philosophy products that I have tried lately. They are on the pricey side, so I definitely expected much better quality. I had no idea that regular Ponds Cold Cream would beat out such a product as Philosophy. I should have erred on the side of ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"" and not changed my line of facial products. Lesson learned. Sad that I cannot return these products."
1,Purity with a side of toxicity?!,"I was excited to finally have a facial cleanser to melt away makeup and it worked wonders at first...HOWEVER, I started to break out...BAD! I could literally connect the pimple dots on my face! UGHHH! Then I discovered that it has IMIDAZOLIDINYL UREA(found in urine)! Which I have researched and it is toxic for your skin! I cannot express how angry I am, not just because it's expensive but also because it's supposed to purify your skin. I'm never purchasing from Philosophy again."
1,Waste of Money,"So I was sucked into the Philosophy hype and great reviews. After giving the product not 1 but 2 tries I have to say that its like washing your face with lotion. Yeah its soft afterward but is it clean? NO, Not in the least. Initially bought a trial set from sephora and while I wasnt overly impressed with any of the products I reordered the cleanser from Amazon. It just doesnt clean my face. After using a retinol pad after washing at night i saw dirt/residue whatever you want to call it on the pad. I believe it caused small breakouts due to going to bed with a face that wasnt totally clean. Im back to Avon Ageless solutions and I find that it CLEANS my face and makes it feels smooth. I even have my mom hooked on it now.After reading this you still decide to try it; Good luck!"
1,Very disappointed,"I finally bought this product and was very excited to try it. It had wonderful online reviews, and a few of my friends swear by it. The first 2 weeks were decent, I did not get the usual huge under the skin pimples that I get at a certain time of the month, but I did have a few tiny pimples. Currently, my skin is the worst it has ever been. After those first two weeks my skin went CRAZY and I have a TON of whiteheads and painful under the skin pimples. I can't believe my skin broke out this badly. I tried it for one month to be sure it wasn't just a transitioning phase with the small breakouts... and now I have a large bottle with a ton left in it that I will just have to give away!"
5,Great value for the price!,I've tried to get this at the mall and they didn't have this size. This is awesome for the price!
4,Clean without the tightness,"A nice clean without over-drying. The cleanser is creamy and doesn't have a lot of lather. The smell is different but not ""bad"" necessarily. You don't need a lot so the bottle lasts a long time."
2,Not as good as the foaming cleanser,"I love the foaming cleanser but always have problems with it leaking when i travel so I saw this one with the poptop aand thought it might travel better and this is purity for normal to oily so i expected it to be fairly comparable. Not nearly as good as the foaming purity. Within a week, I started to have skin issues because it wasn't cleaning well. Could not stand the smell.Oh well.... lessons learned. I love the philosophy products overall. Just will pass and go back to the other purity cleanser."
5,LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!,"I have realllly sensitive skin and was hesitant to try something new, but I had heard good things and decided to give it a go. Well, I'm hooked! This stuff makes you feel squeaky clean after a day of city pollution, makeup residue and generally feeling grimy. It removes everything you don't want and leaves your face feeling super conditioned and not with that dry, tight, face-lift feeling you get from many other products. Definitely recommend! Totally worth the money."
3,Hmmmm....,"I wish I could love this product, but I don't. At the same time, I wish I could hate it so much I'd just throw it away, but I don't want to do that either.I read so many good reviews about Purity that the first time I used it, I used it with my Clarisonic. Big mistake. My skin became so irritated afterwards that it caused an acne flare up. Purity has some irritating ingredients in it, such as black pepper (of all things...). Therefore most of the time I don't use this thing at all.However, I have found that it works well for removing makeup. I don't know about the long-lasting types of makeup, but at least it works well for removing powder makeup. So that's a plus...In short, if you're thinking about buying this, start with the smallest bottle you can find."
3,You will still need to use the eye make up remove afterwards.,"It does work for basic make-up, but I not really like it has dried out my skin.It not works well for the waterproof mascara! You will still need to use the eye make up remove afterwards."
3,Eh .....,"This was okay. I can't believe I paid so much for a cleanser. I bought it because it was ""Philosophy"" and wanted to splurge just to see if it would make a difference compared with other cheaper cleansers I have used. I don't see any difference, to be quite honest. I'm sure it got the job done -- to clean my face, but I'm sure any other cheaper cleanser would have done the same too. I'm going with cheap cleansers from now own. I have a clarasonic, so I really don't think going expensive would make a difference. My face will still be clean. Not buying again."
3,Not a miracle worker,"After reading all the reviews, I thought this will be a wonderful product. I have been using it for 2 weeks and I haven't noticed a difference. My pores aren't smaller, I have been breaking out more (I'm blaming the hot weather?), and my skin doesn't feel softer. It smells great and you only need to use a little. I don't know if I'm not giving it enough time to work, so I'm going to keep using it to see how it goes. I also bought some more products from philosophy so maybe in combination I'll get better results. I'll update my review if my results change."
2,Made For Mature Skin,"My skin has never been perfectly clear, but in the last 2 to 3 years, it's only been around my time of the month, with a max of 2 bumps at one time. My mom got this from QVC as a Today's Special Value and begged me to try it & told me that it would not break my face out. WRONG! My face went completely beserk. It takes 26 days for your skin to rollover, so I was going to give it that long to clear up my face. But I couldn't. After 2 weeks, my face was so badly broken out & dry & sensitive that I stopped. My face looked horrible, with or without makeup. It made me so self-conscious that I didn't want to leave the house. Within 2 days of switching back to my normal face wash, my skin was no longer dry, it was softer, and the acne had dried up. I think for people with mature skin or skin that is not acne prone, it would be a wonderful product. But for acne prone skin, it has nothing in it to help fight the acne."
5,Just perfect,"This facial cleanser is great when you need to get all that gunk off your face without being too harsh.And it is one step.I don't like to use a lot of make up because it tends to clog my pores and when I do have to use make up, I want everything off at the end of the day immediately.Philosophy does a perfect job of removing it without drying my face."
3,BROKE MY FACE OUT,Use it to clean my makeup brushes...I was truly surprised but this product actually flared up my very light case of Rosacia and I found a better and cheaper face cleaning and moisturizing product at Walmart.
2,Broke Me Out,"I sort of expected that the hype was over nothing, and I was correct. Although this cleanser had some nice qualities such as consistency and pretty packaging, it overall was nothing special. I'm pretty sensitive to most cleansers, so this review should probably only apply to those who share my skin type. The cleanser seemed nice, although the smell was neither pleasing nor repulsive, and it broke me out within about four uses. I rarely get eczema, but the skin on my chin, cheeks, and forehead got extremely itchy and dry to the point of being scaly and rough. I think my skin might have adjusted over time and with lots of hydrocortisone cream, but I wasn't patient enough. Don't buy if you have sensitive skin."
5,"Soft, non-irritating cleanser",I have sensitive skin and this the first cleaner I have found that doesn't leave my face feeling tight and blotchy. It smells nice and feels good on my skin. The large container is a great value.
4,Good product,This product was recommended in Sophora because it cleanses as well as removes eye makeup really well. I loved it so much that I decided to buy the larger size online. I still love the product but I have to admit that the lotion doesn;t seem as thick as it did when I had purchased the small bottle in the store.
4,Absolutely Lovely,"It's really difficult for me to find a good facial cleanser that won't dry out my overly sensitive skin. Purity Made Simple is wonderful! It doesn't dry out my skin, and leaves it feeling so soft and clean. I use it every other day, alternating between it and The Great Mystery. My skin has never looked so great!"
4,Nice!,"I received a sample (3 oz) of this in a kit. I was wary because the product does not say it's oil-free, and most oil that touches my face makes me break out in acne. However, this stuff works really well. I feel like my face is less oily and more fresh throughout the day. I just don't like how pricey it is since I can get similar effects from a $6 discount store cleanser."
4,Almost perfect,"I finally found a product that simplifies my night time routine. Most of the time, it takes off all my eye makeup from the lids and lashes. The only thing that bugs me is that it leaves the makeup under my eye. It's easy enough to wipe off with a towel, but sometimes I need to use a makeup remover wipe- which defeats the purpose of a one step cleanser. OVERALL, I'm in love with this stuff and highly recommend!"
5,Great product!,This is the best cleanser I have ever used. Removes all makeup and doesn't hurt your eyes. I highly recommend.
5,The best cleanser ever,I love this cleanser. It works wonderful on any skin type without drying it. Won't use anything else. I highly recommend it!
5,Love!!,"I think that Philosophy is the best line for skin care and I am a professional esthetician! This is my favorite cleanser, perfect for my sensitive skin. Never irritation or break outs from this product."
3,Average cleanser,"This really works about the same as my previous face wash. Before I used Biore both the face scrub and the ice cleanser and with the philosophy everyone said it was an all in one product, a wash, and makeup remover. Ummm. Not much more than what I was using before. So overall it's really not that much better than anythingElse out there that is about 10$ cheaper. Plus it completely strips my face of moisture where I never had the problem before."
4,just a hint of scent,"Gentle cleanser, been using for yrs now my hubby even uses doesn't dry out skin. Worth the price.Received in a timely manner as well."
3,"Good cleanser, but I don't get the hype","I wasn't wowed by this product. I don't wear makeup and was just looking for a good general facial cleanser. I have oily skin that breaks out in times of stress. I bought this during a stressful time and it seems to have helped, but was not a miracle. It works, but I guess that for the price I thought I would be amazed by it, and I'm just not."
5,Best facial cleanser!,"This is the best facial cleanser by far! I've tried Clinique, Neutrogena,Basis, etc. but I always come back to this.It is gentle yet thorough. I use this in conjunction with my clarisonic."
5,AMAZING <3,"This cleanser by philosophy is THE BOMB DOT COM! I love using it when removing my makeup at the end of the day! It removes all my makeup but I always make sure that I use makeup removing facial wipes, for instance; the Neutrogena Makeup Removing Cleansing Towlettes to remove any left over foundation/makeup from my face. But anyways it leaves my face feeling soft, clean and fresh after!"
5,Great for men and women,"All the ladies rave about this item and have stated they would not use anything else! So, with no make up to removei decided to try for my self which i like very much. I am 62 yr old male and have a mixture of dry/oily skin and this works great for me!"
5,Great Cleanser,Originally I received a sample of this as part of a beauty shipment. I loved it so much I came to Amazon and ordered a big bottle. I have dry sensitive skin and this doesn't dry out my skin and it removes my makeup easily.
4,Good Stuff,My sister recommended this soap b/c they used it at the facial clinic where she worked. It really is a great wash for normal skin. It was worth buying the large pump bottle b/c I don't have to think about buying face wash again for a LONG time!
3,Nothing Special,"I bought this cleanser after reading the rave reviews (I'm a sucker for reviews). After using it for 2 weeks, I have to say that it's nothing special. My face feels neither better nor worse using Philosophy Purity than any other drugstore brand (Neutrogena, Aveeno, Clean & Clear). For $20, I was expecting something special. Maybe the people who gave this product five stars are experiencing a placebo effect where they feel like it's more effective/better for their skin because it's a more expensive cleanser. Or maybe this product just works better for them, who knows? But coming from a girl in her 20s with a normal or combination skin-type, I can't see even a tiny bit of difference.When I run out of Purity, I'll be returning to my regular $10 cleansers thank you very much. While I'm not recommending against anyone buying this product, I wouldn't say it's a ""must-have"" by any stretch of the imagination."
2,Overrated and overpriced,"I bought this because I had heard so much about it. I LOVE all kinds of skin products and cosmetics, tried many and while I can say this is a decent one, I believe there are out there better ones for much less (such as Naive Aloe Facial Cleansing Foam by Kracie - 110g for less than $7). I will not buy it again"
3,Not as a mascara remover,It is a good enough cleanser for light makeup but not for removing mascara or eyeliner.
1,"Dry sensitive skin, beware!","After months of emergency use simply because my regular skin cleanser wasn't around, I began using Purity regularly. I was not a huge fan to begin with. I thought the consistency was too heavy and creamy for me but since i left my Yves Rocher cream cleanser about 150 miles away, I started using purity a for aweek straight.My skin is dry and somewhat sensitive. This cleanser dried out my face even further filling up and creating wrinkles and a saginess to my face that I NEVER had and I'm only in my mid 20s. I had aged about 10 years after 1 week of this stuff. Horrible! Not only that but it left this residue in my fine lines that not even the best exfoliator and moisturizer can get rid off. After switching back to my old cleanser my skin is once again bright firm and supple."
4,Good basic instruction re trunk restoration.,"I found that I was able to do a satisfactory job restoring a trunk using the video as my guide. However, too much time was spent romanticizing about trunk restoration. This time could have been devoted to additional instructions. As an example, more details are needed regarding leather craft and repair. There is mention on the video of additional books being available via the author. But no description or summary of the books was given. (books do not appear to be available via Amazon) END"
5,great product,This is a great product. I love the ease of use with all of the macromedia products and how they all compatible with each other.
2,Not sure about this one......,"I got this for my mom for Christmas. She hasn't used it yet because it smells so bad. It may be a good product if you can get past the smell, it kind of reminds me of rotten oranges."
1,poor quality,The quality of this CD falls far below that of the original vinylLP album. The CD has too great a range between the high and low tonesand does not reproduce the warm mellowness of the LP.
3,Very limited discussion of differing theories of probability,"Gigerenzer(G)does a B+ discussion of the particular items he is interested in covering ,such as the conflict between Neyman(Pearson)and Sir Ronald Fisher over significance levels and confidence intervals and their meaning.However, there is practically no,or a very limited,discussion of the subjectivist theory of probability(Ramsey and de Finetti)or of the logical theory of probability(John Maynard Keynes and Rudolf Carnap).A potential reader ,who is interested in either of the above mentioned approaches to probability ,is forewarned that his curiosity will not be satisfied by reading this book."
2,"More efficient to hand prime with the Lee presses, but was worth a shot....","I was hoping to be able to ""tweak"" it into perfection, but still getting flipped primers, no primers, etc. Now I just pre-prime with a Auto Prime XL and run through my loadmaster without a hitch."
2,New means worse,"This book was purchased to replace an older Webster's Crossword Puzzle Dictioary which was falling apart from much use. I am not usually a complainer, but in this case I must.This new one was a great disapointment! The print is small. The item headings are not clearly indicated. I have found some wordsin the old dictionary which were not in the new one. If I could exchange this book for another copy of our old one, I would do it in a munute."
3,crossword dictionary,I really don't care for this crossword dictionary the actors names are not in order. I like my travel dictionary better it has more to it.
1,Webster's New Explorer Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,I have never received this item!! I should have already received it!!
2,Needs better plugs,"The plugs for this set do not stay in. I had to tape the bottoms closed! It looks nice, but needs to be improved. Napkin design seems to work just fine, only one at a time comes out and fits about 2 inches of napkins at a time. We use it everyday, just wish the plugs were better and more secure."
2,Not impressed.,"I bought this online through amazon from target. It looks cool yeah, nice and heavy, but the thing sucks.The bottom plugs on the salt and pepper shakers fall out easily, and the way the salt pours out, you'll have high sodium in no time. You have to cover half with your thumb.You can only have about 15 napkins in this thing at a time, otherwise when you take one out, they'll all come out.If you don't use alot of napkins and and something that looks cool, buy it. But I rarely take napkins from it, and I never use the salt and pepper shakers."
3,Napkin Holder W/Salt & Pepper Shaker,"This set is exactly what I needed for the new kitchen table during the holidays. However, the fill hole in the bottom of both shakers is cut too large for the plugs (or the plugs are too small for the holes?) I had to put tape on them to hold the salt and pepper in. Disappointed at this lack of quality for this product. Why didn't I return them? I really like the look of the set and assume that all of them are made the same way. I also didn't want to go through a big hassle to just get the same problem again."
5,Great Product,"I love this product! It's so compact and fits just right on my kitchen table. And I love the clip that holds the napkins in place. The delivery was quick, too."
3,great item,"i would love to give this item 5 stars but it was not an exact fit for my vehicle, 1986 olds cutlass, it will however fit after some minor adjustments to door.. At first sight i thought this would actually just bolt in but most door have handles that are Riveted in and require drilling out for easier installation."
2,"I guess with ""10"" Bo hit her peak...or it was a fluke?","But then, she didn't really have to ACT in that, now did she?The title is all wrong. Maybe: Manipulating Slut or Stupid Male Allows Self to be Led Around by Anatomy.Yes, there is nudity, designed specifically to make the genuine American woman feel totally inadequate because she doesn't have a personal trainer, housekeeper and chef. No real point to it. Just T & A to try toget ""more a***s in the seats"".The sex scenes, motorcycle and all, weren't even very good, even with those 2 fine physiques going at it. It all just fell flat. Someone, PLEASE, emote!I understand Jeff Fahey took the movie for the opportunity to work with Robert Mitchum. Ok, that's fine. (Or was it for the op to work with Bo?) But what was someone with Robert Mitchum's chops doing in this movie in the first place? Was he hard up for cash?Maybe for some reason, Fahey likes it in B Movie Hell. No real challenge."
3,Not the tread pictured.,"I ordered the 'Psycho II' because the pictured tread looked better than the psycho I. The tires I received are labeled psycho II on rubber of the tire, but the tread does not match the picture on the order or ad. It looks more like the tread you see in the pictures of the 'Psycho I' with longer gaps directly in the center of the tire between treads making for a bumpier ride on hard surfaces, which is why I wanted the 'Psycho II' tread in the ad picture.That said, they are great tires at a great price, just wrong tread. I am eager to ride so I am just going to stick with these.But, I will not buy from this seller again."
1,Haven't I read/seen/heard this before?,"I don't mind books that operate on a similar theme as many others. When they are populated with utterly unlikable and unoriginal characters who flatly inhabit their deriverative universe, then a book slips off into the territory of the unreadable."
3,The story is reminiscent of one of those old computer adventure games,"I thought the story in this novel was so-so. There is very little techno realism, the story borders on fantasy drivel. But the writing is good, good enough that the novel kept me up late."
2,Castaneda goes High Tech,"The author borrows heavily, and by heavily I mean bordering on plagiarism, from the teachings of Carlos Castaneda and then sugar coats it with pulp computers-have-taken-over-the-world science fiction. The dreaming of hands, choosing a power ally, learning to travel on the astral plane, animal spirit guides...these are all copied en masse from Castaneda's early volumes. If you are interested in the metaphysical aspects of this book, try reading ""The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge"" instead."
1,dissatisfied with the author's portrayal of orthodox judaism,"Giving Up America gives an unfair view of what orthodox Judaism can be and what it usually is to those who lovingly adhere to it. Adherence includes all the beautiful traditions and rich customs and meaningful family life. It is not about keeping ancient laws that have no connection to you. It is about connection; connection with generations past and generations future. The author sadly relinquished her connection when she left her yiddishkeit behind. Daniel does not in any way represent a true orthodox jew. He is sad, his life is empty, and he is looking for a way to fill his void. Where are the children? Where is the community life? The charity work? The holidays? The shul? The weddings? The births? The family celebrations? This is orthodox judaism. Giving Up America is Pearl Abraham's way of ridding the ghosts that haunt her."
1,Not worth your time in reading this book,Giving up America wa a very boring book with a bad storyl-line. I kept thinking that something more exciting would happened in the story but unfortunaltely it did not. The characters were not well developed and one could not identify with any of them. Pearl Abraham better take more courses in writing!!
1,Worst book I've read in 5 years!,"I really *wanted* to like this book, but it was, without a doubt, the worst thing I've read in years. I trudged through it, hoping something would finally happen and take shape...like a story, like character development, like a finding a reason the author wrote the thing in the first place.The characters were flat and dull, the 'affair' was passionless, the Jewish aspects were pointless (and could have been fascinating), the story uninvolving and boring. The main driving emotions here were Pouting and Whining.The writing was very ""clipped"", as if Abraham read a few Hemingway novels and thought, ""Hey, I could do this, too."" And she teaches Writing at NYU? Scary.Very disappointing book with a lot of missed opportunities."
2,"Slow, painful build up","This was tough to read. It was gloomy from the beginning, and maintained that gloominess until nearly the end. The subject matter continues to fascinate, but the plot was predictable (you saw the end coming as soon as the young girl was introduced and then you just waded through, painfully). There was no sympathy for the absurd husband, and no understanding why the main character would have ever chosen him. Still, it was vividly described, and I could relate to the situation, but missing was the joy of The Romance Reader. I'll still look forward to more from Pearl Abraham."
1,Another bummer book,"When I finished reading this book the first question that came to my mind was what does this story (novel) have to do with Orthodox or Jewish life. In no way does it resemble anything close to such lifestyle.Awhile ago I read her first book ""The Romance Reader"" which although it does not resemble the life of a average orthodox jewish girl, it does portray the the life of a jewish girl struggling with her beliefs and hasidic surroundings.After reading both books I have come to the conclusion that the author has no vision or imagination for writing novels or fictions. Her first book is actually not a novel but aportrait of her own life. In this book ""Giving Up America"" the author attempts to write a novel and all it does is portray her as a person with a poor and immature imagination, even her sex scenes shows that she lacks fantasy or imagination..Unless youre on a deserted island and there is nothing else to do, I wouldn't recommend waisting your time reading this book."
3,Dreary; has little to do with the title,"Dreary... dreary characters, dreary settings, dreary actions ... it was like there was no marriage at all to begin with. Although the story does give some insight into Hasidic and Orthodox Jewish lives, and it is supposed to be ""the weight of conflicting faiths"" that causes the demise of this marriage, it is really the almost complete lack of investment in the relationship by either the wife or the husband that fails to keep it together and help it grow.I did read the whole thing because it was helping me learn about Jewish thinking and life in big cities, but mostly I just did not care about these characters.One reason the reading was so dreary was that there is absolutely no dialogue punctuation in it, so the tone is almost exactly the same, no matter what is happening."
2,Slow to start and slow to finish,"I got through a lot of this book before something started to maybe happen. Then, when things started to get ""good,"" it still was a long time coming.The honest prose makes this seem like a very auto-biographical book, so I can't knock that. But, sometimes real life needs to be spiced up a bit for good fiction. Real life is not stark black and white, but fiction kind of needs that. In real life, people are mamby pamby and tip toe around things. In books, people should not.Half way through the book, I found myself skipping whole chapters to get to the ""good parts,"" and then reading the final page just to see how it turned out.That's not the making of a classic book."
4,"An homage to a different age, with a modern touch...","A review of the score, not the film:This is a wonderful homage to the adventure scores of yesteryear (as it should be, because of the overall vibe of the film).Does it equal the old Korngold, Steiner, or Newman scores? Well, of course not! But as a tribute to the style, it is incredibly effective. A real plus is that the sound quality is so rich and full, it really comes off as an up-to-date idealization of those styles.I've given it about five spins, and I like every track more and more each time.(I bought this based partly on the review at Filmtracks dot com, and partly on my memory of seeing the film when it was released 8 years ago...)Basically-If ""The Good German"" by Thomas Newman is Golden Age intrigue for the modern listener, then ""Sky Captain"" is Golden Age adventure for the modern listener.Buy it, and play it loud!"
3,Could have been better,The toy was smaller than I thought. I would have kept it though because that is what my daughter wanted. I had to return it though because the leg was broken off.
1,Theosis is not unique to Mormonism,"Nathan Jensen is very excited to report that C.S. Lewis said it's our destiny ""to become gods and goddesses."" Lewis didn't. Lewis probably said, somewhere, that the Lord wants us to become more like Him. Brighamite Mormonism's belief that we can become Gods is a distortion of ""Theosis"", a concept which spans Christian history.Here are 3 books on Theosis:The Doctrine of Deification in the Greek Patristic Tradition (Oxford Early Christian Studies)Theosis: Deification in Christian Theology (Princeton Theological Monograph)Partakers of the Divine Nature: The History and Development of Deification in the Christian Traditions"
1,Do not be decieved,"Please do not be decieved into believing the lies that this books spews, it is neither a plausible nor in anyway acurate depiction of C S Lewis. He himself would be appauled at the implication that he agreed with the mormon philosphies. He was a true bornagain believer with a total desire to follow the one true Jesus Christ. Mormons believe that Jesus and Satan were brothers.So to assiociate the writings of a genius with the heretical lies of mormonism is totally rediculous and credulous. Keep your money and buy a book specifically written by the master himself. I personally love 'the great divorce' it will inspire your soul touch your sences and bring u face to face with the majesty and wonder of Jesus Christ our precious redeemer. The lord bless you all!"
4,I LOVE IT!,"I bought this game 3 days a go, and I am very happy with it.The graphics are outstanding and I have to say the same for the music! I can't put it down it is soooooooooo great.I have books,toys,tapes and now the game from Dinotopia.I LOVE DINOTOPIA!"
3,A good singer who is worthy a good listen!,"Roslyn Kind has always lived in the shadow of Barbra Streisand. A tough call for any artist with a famous sibling. I saw her sing once in LA at a night club and thought she had something really special but just never really hit the bigtime because of comparisions to La Streisand. This CD is a nice collection but the re-verb is huge on certain tracks which tends to make it sound overblown. .... ....Robert Rigby, Queensland, Australia"
4,Streisand Clone,"Poor Roslyn Kind- she sounds too much like her infamous sister, Barbra Streisand.She is talented and blessed with a beautiful and pure vocal instrument; she will unfortunately never be judged on her own talent and merit."
3,In the Shadow of a Giant,"Having been a fan of Barbra Streisand for over forty years, I was curious to know how her half-sister, Roslyn Kind, measured up in the vocal stakes. I am pleased to report that Roslyn has a superb voice & vocal style and does not suffer in comparison with her more-famous sibling.The great frustration is that this genuine talent is being under-sold by the cheap production on this album. She deserves better than to have her songs backed by the accompaniment of a single piano and I am sure that an investment in full orchestral backing would have improved the experience."
4,Renegade Underrated!! / T& L Overrated!!!!!,"This album is great...with the exception of maybe ""Fats"", this is a sold effort....true, some of the songs may not generally flow together, but this is not a concept album!Look at it as a collection of songs.......and certainly some stronger songs make up for the weaker ones........certainly It's Getting Dangerous is one of Phil's best efforts.........The Thunder and Lightning album?......with the exception of Sun Goes Down, it just sounds like another bland 80's metal album.....definitely not on par with their earlier efforts and not this one......"
3,A respectable album but not a Lizzy classic,"Great cover art, decent songs, but not a Lizzy classic. They produced plenty of 5-star albums -- check those out first. The Golden age of Lizzy featured Brian Robertson on guitar."
4,ANGEL OF DEATH!!!!,"THIS ALBUM GOT A LOT OF CRITICISM ,AND I THINk THIS IS A FINE EFFORT IT MAY NOT BE AS GOOD AS A LOT OF THEIR STUFF BUT a lot OF IT IS BETTER THAN SOME OF THEIR STUFF, I LIKE THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE SONGS ARE HARDER AND HAVE A DARKER EDGE THE ONLY SONG ON HERE THAT ISNT VERY GOOD IS MEXICAN BLOOD , angel of death is the best on here along with the pressure will BLOW,hollywood down on your luck, if you like a heavier thin lizzy, then you need to buy this you cant go wrong with any thin lizzy music."
5,We Needed This Book!,"We needed this book. As you read it, it becomes more and more satisfying. And the final section with selected portions of Jim Grant's own speeches becomes a worthy and memorable climax. It is amazaing to find that a person we thought we knew so well emerges as so much more than we suspected. His commitment is truly moving, and the cheerfulness and enthusiasm with which he stuck to it is equally impressive.What now remains is for Grant's mission to be completed by others. That story remains to be seen. It already seems clear that his contribution will be lasting. The editor's work with Jim Grant must have been a marvellous period in his own life. I think he has made a very fine job with this book."
4,A Change is Always Good,"I think opera, as a tradition, tends to stagnate in, well...tradition. It's good that opera is also being expanded to the media of today. This for-film movie production takes all advantage that the video medium has to grant, without the limitations of a traditional filmed stage production. The acting is perfect (Domingo gets better every time I see him, and this performance tops the cake). The casting is very appropriate (Stratas is indeed the sickly prima donna!). Also, the cinematography and camera-work are the work one might expect from Hollywood, not from opera: superb!All in all, buy it for its creativity."
5,wonderful production,"Verdi - La Traviata / Levine, Stratas, DomingoI saw this production in 1986 and I was so impressed with this performance that I always want to have this particular version of la Traviata. I saw this DVD when I received this one a couple of weeks ago and my opinion didn't change."
5,Verdi La Traviata,"Wonderful,the music is one of my favorite and the story out of this world....You will never regret watching this wonderful movie..."
5,Is a double WOW,"This is a timeless work of art. I own a copy but not wanting to part from it, I purchased to give as a gift.EnjoyTeresa"
5,Best La Traviata Ever,"The brilliance of the singers shines in great virtuosic performances by Teresa Stratas and Placido Domingo at the prime of their great careers. As always, James Levine and The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus are unsurpassed. The film's really unique quality is the production and direction of Franco Zefferelli. i.Could anyone surpass or even match one of his productions?"
1,A Serious Disappointment,"I have recently purchased and watched as many Operas as I could afford on DVD. Each has been wonderful and short of being there this format gives a truly emotional experience. I knew that Franco Zifferelli's film would be different but I was not prepared for the utterly one dimensional presentation of what is otherwise great music by performers of the highest calibre. The picture quality was little better than VHS (poor), sound was seriously flawed throughout and with no PCM stereo soundtrack included the option of using the disc as a sound only CD was not available to save the day. I cannot recommend this presentation to anyone who expects to enjoy an opera. It is a horrible experience and one I hope never to repeat. Opera depends for much of its impact on the stylised acting that singers must use to convey the drama and their performance needs the interaction that can only come from an audience participating in a live performance. Even as a film this production is poor."
3,verging on grotesque,"You may want to turn down the sound (or turn it off altogether) in order to enjoy the movie more. The real problem that recurs throughout the movie is Mme Stratas' voice. It gets to the point where it's downright grotesque more than once or twice. It made me think that she was forced to act and to sing simultaneously which, of course, was not the case."
2,watch the actual opera,"I rented this movie because I fell in love with the aria ""sempre libera"" and just had to see it performed. First, let me say I have heard Anne Moffo perform ""sempre"" (beautiful voice), and I was very disapointed to hear Teresa Stratas performance of it. Perhaps I'm holding Stratas to too high a standard, but in my opinion the aria was butchered by her. I've heard in the past that she's a wonderful vocalist, but I wasn't very impressed.As for the ""opera-film"", I suggest to anyone who is used to live operas not to buy this film. The characters lip sync (terribly I might add) and it takes away from the beauty of the opera. You get the impression you've watching a MTV video rather than a Verdi masterpiece.If you've new to opera, or very easy to please when it comes to opera, I think you'll enjoy it. But any seasoned opera buff would be much better off leaving this behind. Besides the priceless tenor role, this film is a disgrace to one of Verdi's most beloved operas"
1,terrible and embarassing subtitles,"I have this Zefferilli movie on Laserdisc and am familiar with it; the Laserdisc version has appropriate subtitile, i.e. translation of the Italian dialogue into English. This DVD version has inappropriate garbage in the subtitles, e.g. ""laughter"" ""vocalizing"" ""coughing"" etc., which is distracting and spoils the opera."
5,For the Extremely Passionate Romantic,"I am going to buy this movie so I can watch it 100 times. It is my third favorite movie in the world. I was not an opera fan but 20+ years ago had a thing for Placido Domingo after he did the Perhaps Love duet with John Denver. So when this movie came to an obsure theater in my town I rushed to see it. Went back the next night, and the next, etc., until they stopped showing it. I dragged anyone and everyone with me who was willing to go. Even played hookey from dance company rehersal and dragged by partner. By that time I had seen it so many times and had told him the story in such depth that he was amazed I hadn't missed one detail. That is how much this movie meant to me. You don't have to like opera or musicals but you must be very passionate and romantic to watch this film."
5,OPera at its best,This film of one of the best loved operas is brilliant both in performance and setting. Even someone who does not attend the opera cannot fail to enjoy and be moved by this production.
5,The best filmed version of the two I have seen,"La Traviata on DVD has been released in two versions that I have seen. One was filmed at the Teatro Venice as a stage presentation to a live audiece and it showed.The other is the Placido Domingo version made as a movie with creative use of lighting, and sets. Released now by Universal, my only quibble is the sub-titles which are only accessible as hearing -impaired extras which means additional titles like ""bells ringing"", ""women laughing"" etc.That aside, the movie is as good as Domingo's other effort ""Carmen""."
5,"The best opera, The best version.","I have seen and heard well over thirty Traviatas ,This ONE is far away the best.THE VERY BEST!!!!!!!"
3,Nice try,"I like this movie a lot because of the good performance and excellent photography. Domingo's Alfredo is still good enough however, Stratas's Violetta is not good at all in Act I - her voice is quite annoying and it seems that she cannot adjust her breathing while she is singing - things become better when Germont shows up in Act II. Sound quality is much better than that recorded in an opera house, so is the image quality. It's a good choice for those who do not really enjoy opera (just like me) or who want to try something different."
5,Finally,"I had a VCR of this performance, but it degraded over the years, and I have been looking for a DVD for a few years, but they, when available, were grossly overpriced. I was overjoyed when I found this one at a very good price; I was a little concerned because this dealer is from England, and I think some DVDs are coded to only play in certain parts of the world, and I couldn't find any mention of that.When it came I noted it is coded for worldwide use, and it was in perfect shape. It arrived far before the promised date.Some purists criticize this performance for some omissions and for being a film, but it is my experience that directors very often omit scenes from operas. If such artistic license does not bother you, this is a valuable addition to any library."
5,Libiamo! Godiamo!,"Drink and be happy with this luscious and moving rendition of this opera classic. Gloriously rich colors are thoughtfully used in concert with the music and plot. The production design makes you feel what it must have been like to live the life of the truly wealthy Parisians of the time. This is NOT a filmed version of a staged opera (which usually are only useful for archival purposes) but, truly a movie."
1,horable,worst ever never got product this was the worst buy ever dont buy from him i want a refund so i can buy from some one else.
2,Mostly spell cards,"Received mostly spell cards. Only 3 of the red cards. Forget what they are called. Few monsters. Had doubles, triples, qaudruples, & even 5 of some cards. Some cards looked rough around the edges. I had to buy extra monster cards from other people. Definately wouldn't have bought these if I would've known all this before hand."
5,the best way to get more card for your buck & some very good ones 2,The best way to get a lot of cards very useful and very inexpensive way to boost your own deckand a way to trade more with your friends
2,Definitely a bad purchase,"I had high hopes, when I purchased this product, but it was a complete disappointment. First of all, the cards came with too many duplicates. No rares were in there and none of them were hollow. I couldn't make use of any of these cards, too many mismatches. The only usefulness this served as was to trade them all in for better cards."
3,Rare???,The rare cards aren't really rare. They just have a little holographics on the card name. I don't think they are powerful enough to be called rare.
2,Gaming ect WORSE than ABCTOY4ME,I had already bought from ABCTOY4ME and they gave me weak cards but some were decent and a few repeats of useless spell cards and rituals... I tried Gaming ect and they gave me 5 cards over 2000 attack highest was 24000 attack 7 repeat of a useless weak card was the most but that would have been fine if the rest of the 107 card deck was full of repeast everywhere and majority of monster cards ranging from 100 attack-1000 few 1400 attack and rarely any 1400 + attack... full of useless traps and magic cards I DO NOT recommend buying from Gaming ect.
3,Completely determinable by the seller.,"Word to the wise.I bought a 100 random pack from ABCTOY4ME. 100 random cards for 6+ dollars is definitely a good buy and am happy with my product. But, like another reviewer on here said before me, I believe the actual decency of cards you win are determinable by the seller. One reviewer here was disappointed by ABCTOY4ME, and I'm a little disappointed myself, the holographic card I got from them was this useless ritual spell card with no included ritual monster. I also got 11 duplicates of trap card D-chain. Also useless.So word to the wise, try and proxy to see which seller will promise you a good variation of cards. Last time I purchase from ABCTOY4ME. I recently just ordered another 100 random pack from ToyNGamesEtc, so hopefully the heart of the cards will be on my side.All in all, irresistible deal; pick your poison."
2,Not condition as promised,"Unless, you have young children that really dont know quality. Dont bother purchasing from this company. Cards came in plastic baggie def' no where near being new or ""mint"" condition."
3,Too many doubles/triples/quadruples/...etc. (A kid's Review),"This came in the mail today and i was very disappointed. I got this from CARDRUSH and i was not happy. There were many of the same cards. I was happy to see that the cards were in a deck box, so it was kind of worth it."
2,Ridiculous,"I ordered this expecting to get at least SOME variety. When the package got here, I opened it and began separating the cards into piles based on their type. It seems like there were just multiples of the same pack, so I've got about 10 of the same card for all of them! No variety! I am highly upset because a few multiples would have been okay but seriously? ALL OF THEM? I didn't expect much for this price but I expected better than this."
2,worthless commons,"out of a hundred cards only one was worth keeping, the delivery was quick and thats the only reason am not rating this product 1star.just spend your money buying singles rather than getting a dozen random cards that have no collection value and no efficiency."
4,cardrush lot,"110 cards, including 5 rares and a super rare. Not a great variety, pretty much every common was TDGS. I didn't have much from that set, so it was interesting to see the new cards though."
5,Very nice!!!,I just got this today and im very impressed on how fast it arrived XD i was worried about there not being a traking but it arrived really early so overall im very happy!! and the cards are great and in mint condition i only got a couple repeats so its ok . i also got 110 cards instead of just 100 cards so very good bonus.i recommend buying from this seller for a great variety of mint condition cards.
3,"Fun Multiplayer, mediocre single player","Let me begin by saying description of this game being only 1 and 2 player is wrong. I have played this game with 4 of my friends, and the multiplayer modes are a lot of fun (Knight's Tournament, and Parfait Getaway more so than Race). It is ashame that the single player mode was not as good. However, there are some interesting levels. If I were younger, I probably would have enjoyed this game a bit more."
1,The only thing that is Shrek like is that the game stinks,"Simply awful: lousy graphics, sound and gameplay. Imitates Mario Kart (same game strucutre) and does it badly. Do not buy play or look at."
1,No.,"Anything that is even remotley connected to the word Shrek (particularly the movie) is loathsome on sheer principle. Add to this fact the track record of previous Shrek video games (""Shrek"" for xbox and ""Shrek: Fairytale freakdown"" for Gameboy Color, both considered some of the worst games spawned for their respective systems,) also, throwing into the mix the high propensity for atrocious ""Kart"" racing games; one now has the recipe for what is quite possibly one of the worst video games ever made. Or maybe it will just be mediocre, which is probably worse...."
2,The Captain's Wife,"The Captain's Wife is a good story, but could have used some editing. The condition of the book was fair. It had been withdrawn from a library in MI, where it had seen good use. It was OK."
4,Blue Murder\John Sykes Fans: Buy This,"The 3rd and last album from Blue Murder. Basically, a live greatest hits package from one of the most underrated rock bands. This album was recorded in Japan and was a tribute from singer/guitarist John Sykes to his late, great friend Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy. Most of the songs are drawn from the first 2 Blue Murder albums while 3 are from John's Whitesnake and Thin Lizzy days. Some of the songs such as ""Still of the Night"" and ""Jelly Roll"" have different arrangements giving a unique twist on the standards. I enjoyed the new arrangements as they were definitely catered for a warm live feel for the audience. I have never seen Blue Murder or John Sykes live(except on videotape) but this is as good as it gets. Well done!!"
3,fantastic guitar playing but average vocals,"This is the only live album from Blue Murder, the band put together by former Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake Guitarist John Sykes. The Blue Murder tracks (eg. Jelly Roll) are very good,and benefit from the live setting. However, the versions of Thin Lizzy (Dancing in the Moonlight, Cold Sweat) and Whitesnake (the immortal Still of the Night) tracks are fine when listened to by themselves, but compared to the originals they are disappointing. Sykes' chops are fantastic (he is one of rock's premier, and most underrated, guitarists), but his voice is average. He isn't a bad singer, he just lacks the character and earnest sincerity of Phil Lynott and the amazing bluesy power of David Coverdale. If this album had a few more tracks from Blue Murder albums instead of disappointing versions of songs by Sykes' former bands it would probably have got four stars. Good effort nonetheless, and still a good addition to any classic rock music collection."
2,money making scam,"While I haven't read it yet, their first book, ""Make Every Girl Want You"" is supposed to be pretty good. ""The Nice Guy's Guide. . . "" however is mostly a money making scam. I read it in a couple of hours, and got some useful pointers, but lots and lots of references back to the first book. Also lots of suggestions that I should check their web site to buy more stuff online. Additionally, no where on the cover material does it say anything like ""this is the 3rd book in the series on how to get girls, and you should check out the other two first"". Pretty misleading."
2,Not great,It should not have repeated the same stuff as they did in they're other books. Changing the title doesn't make it a different book.
3,Hit and miss,"I like this book for the most part. The shameless plugs for the authors' other books get really annoying after a while and some of the info is common sense and/or 7th grade knowledge, but in general, it's good stuff, keeping in mind I haven't officially practiced any of it in earnest yet. I especially liked the online dating chapter. It contained pretty basic but extensive knowledge.Starting out reading this book, it seemed like the authors were merely setting out to tell jerks how to ""pretend"" to be nice to get women, but you get a little further into it, and they basically shift to just dispensing information for the jerks and true nice guys alike to use at your own risk (refreshingly, they even give a disclaimer to that nature at the beginning)."
1,Buy if you want to find out how to NOT get girls,"This book is filthy trash. The people who wrote this are money making A@# holes. I wasted my money and I hope you don't. They even try to lie to you by saying there are already 50 thousand copies in print. Truthfully, if you don't want to have any dates, relationships, friends, and one night stands then by this book."
4,Very impressed,"I am in the midst of reading this book and i must say that I am very impressed. This stuff really works and is more than the typical book that is centered on getting a girl solely into bed. I think these guys have done a great job and made great successes. So far, from everything I've ready in here, I've been amazed!! Congratulations to the nice guys on their book success. I read numerous online articles about dating and women but this was the first to mention the real truth of where to meet women. Great stuff."
4,"very good, everyone should read it.",I think this book should be required reading. I thought it was the most eduacating and interesting book I have read. Every nice guy needs to read this book.
4,had trouble until now,"I must say i really had trouble getting girls to like me until i read this book. I got the book on Friday night and had one of the greatst conversations with a girl i have ever had on saturday. I liked this girl but never got too far with her. but this time it was different....here are some things she actually said to me during our conversation ""So i guess you talk to a lot of girls cause you really know how to make a girl feel good and appreciated"" ""..You are not shy anymore and i love that, you are so cool, sweet and nice, you are not a jerk anymore and i love that and a girl would be lucky to have you as a boyfriend"".......I can't beleive a girl actually said those things to me, i reallly must thank these guys have done a splendid job creating this book for guys like me."
5,Unbelievable photographs,Robert Dawson's photographs are so moving. He captures moments that are truly beautiful. His books (Along the Cowboy Trail and this one) make wonderful gifts for those horse lovers and cowboys/cowgirls!
5,I must disagree with CPM's (CA) review,"I personally have both books by editor Tammy LeRoy and photographer ROBERT Dawson. They do, indeed, have absolutely beautiful photographs and Tammy is a gifted writer/editor that helps those photographs be appreciated even more by her words.If you have an opportunity to pick up these books, they are well worth the investment and make wonderful gifts to everyone -- horse lover or not."
1,Worst Writing Ever!,"Richard Dawson's pictures are beautiful, but the whole book is brought down by the hopeless drivel that is written by LeRoy. She is obviously an uneducated writer who would be better suited to producing bad greeting cards rather than ruining the work of this excellent photographer. If you decide to purchase this book, pick up a Sharpie marker too. Black out all of the text and you will have a reasonably enjoyable time paging through the photographs."
2,A somewhat amateur production,"We had this rushed to re-learn the swing steps before a dance at our church. I chose it because of the great reviews, but I'm sorry to say that we were a little disappointed. There's a bit too much boring chit-chat. When you finally get the parts where you follow along and dance, it's difficult because there is rarely any music, just the guy talking you through it. I realize that they cannot use copyrighted music without permission. That being said, it would've been better to at least have a ticking metronome. This is especially difficult when you're trying to turn, and can't always see the TV. Also, the instructors are below average when it comes to articulating and enunciating their speech. It was helpful, but more amateur than expected."
5,Great start,"We wanted to learn how to swing dance but felt so self-conscious on the dance floor that we couldn't do the classes. This really helped get us started on our own turf. We bought Vol 2 and the Intermediate Vol1 and highly recommend all three. The quality is good and Shawn focuses on the lead role quite a bit, which is what we need the most help from."
3,"Just OK, quality of DVD - borderline",I bought this DVD along with Volume 2 and was a little disappointed. The video quality just isn't there - very fuzzy at times and it's not nearly as good as another DVD I got from DanceVision. The one I got from there is by Don Johnson - Anyone Can Dance Single Time Swing (Jitterbug). This one is a single DVD (only $24.99) with 12 steps you can learn with BOTH beginner & intermediate levels. Much better quality and easier to learn.
2,Better Choices,"The visual quality of the video was quite poor. It was as though the video had been copied so many times that it got very grainny. Also, the split screen effects were poor and distracting. The instruction was fair and boring at times."
2,Poor video quality,"This video looks like it was recorded with an old cell phone. I can't believe anyone would put out such a poor production.The content was good. However, they spent 1.25 hrs. going over what should have taken 0.5 hrs. In that time, they didn't even get to an inside turn!This is not a 5-star product - Shawn T. must have 23 close friends."
5,What a great video!!,"WOW! Having been born with two left feet I was thrilled to find ""Swing Dancing for Beginners""! Shawn and Joanna break the dance down into easy steps that ANYONE can easily understand and perform. The way this video is filmed is unique and makes it simple to follow their lead. After years of wanting to be able to dance, my husband and I have finally found a teaching method that works! I can't wait to try Volume 2."
5,Great for beginners,"This DVD is all you need to learn the basic swing steps, fast swing as well as slow swing depending on the music being played. The instruction technics were simple to learn and easy to remember. As an example, using the Hula Hoop as an aid to demonstrate the swing move is superb and is imprinted in the viewer's mind. I strongly recommend it to beginners."
5,A True Beginning Swing Dancers DVD,"I have many swing dance DVD's at home but this one is by far the best. The instructor breaks down each step, arm position, and dance position into its most basic form allowing a person who has never danced before to master the basics. Each step is repeated many times so that there is no need to stop and replay each section. Split camera angles are used effectively to show the proper position of each partner. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who has no prior experience in dance."
3,What happened to Eddie Quinlan?,"I saw this movie on TCM TV last night and although it wasn't a box-office hit, it was decent entertainment especially with Ginger Rogers in the cast. I didn't recognize Robert Armstrong in the cast, however. Quinlan was a good actor. What ever happened to him? I couldn't find anything on the 'net concerning his career or biography."
5,"Makes it easy-free tutoring, & web site practice problems!","This book is not all you get. The book itself is great. But the additional FREE helps which come with the book assure that even the most inept math student can learn algebra. These helps consist of, but are not limited to:1) free tutoring via phone,email,& fax; 2)free practice problems via internet website. Other supplemental materials consist of: Videotapes, Tutorial Software, and a solutions manual. These are all available for the student. I haven't even mentioned the benefits that a classroom teacher has through the Instructor Supplements. These consist of a Test Bank/Instructor's Guide, extra practice problems, mtls for transparencies, video tape index, and several tools for the computer users: test generator, test grader,on-line course management and testing. In other words, this is a great resource for teachers also. I am in the processing of trying to purchase it for my school."
1,Elementary & Intermediate,I have not received this order as of today. Very bad experience...They charged me and never sent me the book
4,Right On Time,The book I ordered was much cheaper than my schools site. It was in an immaculate condition. The shipping was much faster than I thought it would be. I would advise anyone to order from Amazon.
1,Headphones,Very difficult to hook-up. I've been working at it for a few hours now and still not set up. Instructions hard to follow and understand. While looking at the headphone there is no volume control which is why I Bought it. My hearing is bad in one ear.
2,Does not have wireless radio,"I purchased these headphones for my husband to use when he's mowing the grass & working outside. The data on the website gave me the impression that these headphones were able to do this. They do not have radio controls, so I returned them. The Supplier, Adorama Camera, were very accommodating. So I have no complaint about them, just the headphones were not what I expected."
4,Great sound! Great buy! Only minor interference issues.,"I am really impressed with the sound quality and surround sound aspects of these headphones. Occassionally, I do hear a little static, but so far it looks like that has been due to the quality of the signal going to the emitter because most DVD's (esp. blueray) sound perfect. These were easy to set up. I definitely get interference from my microwave. Also, I think that the headphones occassionally interfere with my wifi. I am running a PS3 as a blueray and gaming system with these headphones. Sometimes I have to leave the headphones on the cradle (no signal) until I have signed in to the online gaming servers. Most of the time, if I do that, I have no problems. Overall, these have been a great buy, and I would highly recommend!"
3,2.4 Ghz interference,"Really looked forward to using these headphones and not having to turn the volume down at bedtime. worked great, sounded great, but look out when you use your microwave, or if you have a newer wireless router that transmits at 2.4, they will drop out consistently. its a shame, as the sound was fantastic. Volume control was easy to get at, and charging was easy. so if you do not have a wireless network, I would say I would have kept them. unfortunately, I had to send them back for the price i paid, i could not put up with interference."
3,"Great headphones, very annoying beeping sound......","I was in the market for a high sound quality, wireless headset, and ended up purchasing this model. The sound quality is great, even when a good distance away from transmitter, and they're quite comfortable as well. On the downside however, the headphones will emit an annoying beeping sound shortly after it detects no sound input signal. In other words, if you wear the headset while not actually listening to something, they will beep continuously until it detects a signal, VERY ANNOYING.....IMO..."
5,Worth the Price,"These are great. I have had some other wireless Dolby/Digital headsets, and they just don't compare. I am so please with these. While they may not completely block out outside sound, they are perfect for my needs. My only wish might be for a lesser price. But they are still well worth the price I paid."
5,great surround sound,"SURROUND SOUND IS AMAZING! I BOUGHT A CABLE ,(INEXPENSIVE),TO HOOK UP TO THE HEAD PHONE JACK ON THE AMP THAT'S PART OF MY HOME THEATRE-THIS ALLOWS ME TO LISTEN TO ALL AUDIO IN THE SYSTEM. T.V.,CD,DVD, RADIO, ALL SOUND NICE.YOU HAVE TO SWITCH TO ANALOG AT BASE WITH THIS METHOD BUT YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED.YOU CAN EVEN GO OUTSIDE WITH THEM ON WITHOUT INTERFERENCE."
1,Wireless head phones,These phones are highly intermittent even when very close to the transmitter. I cannot find a local repair station and I am disappointed with this expensive purchase
3,Pretty good,Sound is pretty good. It fills the need that I bought them for. The only compliant I have is that they are not adjustable for the shape of your head and the earcups don't rotate. They them on and if they fit buy them.
3,Interference With Existing Wi-Fi Network!,These are good headphones only if they don't keep interfering with existing 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network. I kept switching to different frequency but they still knocked out my Wi-Fi network! I gave up and sending them back...
4,Good Buy,"Okay great product. Great sound quality etc, long lifespan... Now for the Bad: Any usage of Microwave Ovens/similar devices will cause these devices not to work for a period of time until you stop the interference. They also cause a lot of interference with many/most Wireless Router Signals. Although sometimes that can be a good thing especially if you are using an unsecure and want to cut other people off for fun XD. Because these Devices are so comfy and wireless you tend to leave them on for long periods of time, if your music stops and no sound happens for 3-5 mins or so you will get a constant alert beeping in the headphones which is annoying.The Pros: Very comfortable, have had for 1 year and virtually no problems; I may have to reset these things every now and then a bit more frequently but still its a simple push of a button on the headphones/base."
4,Well worth the money,"I purchased the headphones for my home office. They allow me to move between two desks and various filing cabinets without being corded to a computer. The headphones ""tune-out"" most, if not all, of the background noise in the house created by kids and dog.The only issues I see with the headphones are:1. They sit lightly on your head...great for comfort, not so great if you are going yard work or something even remotely active.2. The range is OK. I can make it down stairs to my kitchen, but one step further and they cut out...I am guessing 40 foot range is what I experience.3. I have no complaints about the sound quality or static.Overall a great product."
1,This is a well titled record!,"Joe Maphis had undeniable talent and technique as a flat picking guitar monster. Unfortunately, his records are unlistenable. Why? He rushed the beat so much. It's uncomfortable to hear. Drummers must have hated playing with him. But as another reviewer said, it must have worked better live. Listen to Jimmy Bryant or George Barnes ""Country Jazz"" to hear better version of this sort of guitar playing."
1,Disturbing recomendations,"This book promotes child abuse.If you follow the advice in this book, you will end up losing your child/ren through child protective services or at the very least seriously harm your child/ren."
1,Not loving and NOT Christian.,"This book is disgusting and I'm amazed that Amazon would carry it.It is NOT Christian based discipline. Christ advocated love and kindness not pain and humiliation.Christians who cling to the verse in Proverbs to justify them striking their children are DENYING the saving power of the Man they claim as their saviour for their sins.Did Christ not die for your childrens sins? Must the parent beat salvation into their children? NO! Christ died for your childrens sins, that is the only salvation they need. They do not need your disciplin to save them from Hell.Christ took that punishment for them.God help you and may He work on your hearts to teach you how to care for your children in a loving and Christ like way."
1,Appalled that Amazon would even offer this book,"This book is nauseating! It is pretty much a How To Abuse A Child 101. It's sickening. I've had trouble getting to sleep because of thinking about it, and thinking about the fact that horrible parents like this even exist (and flaunt it!). Please, for the sake of your child, do NOT buy this book. Dr. Sears writes a wonderful Christian parenting book on discipline called ""The Discipline Book"". A much better read if you truly want your children to love you instead of fear you."
1,"Few points on, many points off.","It is interesting how many reviews are going after the ""rod"" of discipline topic. Honestly, though I didn't fully agree with the discipline tactics mentioned in this book, the biggest issues in this book were utilizing scripture incorrectly. Many ""opinions"" were being stated as if coming from the Bible but were in fact just twisted versions of the verse to fit his viewpoint. At the start of the book, the author does fairly well with correctly listing out verses and points about them... but as the book progressed it became more about ""praying things into being"", which actually comes from the verse where it is GOD who prays things into being that were not yet in existence. This book is very emotionally ""spirit-led"" and I say that loosely. If truly Spirit-led, it would be completely in line with Scripture. I will never recommend this book to anyone. Please don't just believe someone because they have it in print, test it with the true Word of God we have been given."
1,Child Abuse Advocate,"This book advocates beating children with instruments such as a willow branch from as young as four months, which has led recently to the murder of a 7 year old girl and hospitalization of an 11 year old girl by their adoptive parents, following Pearl's advice. In addition, the case of a four year old suffocating to death at the hands of his mother in 2006 is attributed to following his advice.""Ridge parents Kevin and Elizabeth Schatz are charged with murder and torture following the death of 7-year-old Lydia Schatz and the hospitalization of 11-year-old Zariah Schatz. Both girls were allegedly whipped by the their adoptive parents with a quarter-inch plumbing supply line - the instrument suggested by Michael and Debi Pearl, founders of No Greater Joy Ministries and authors of the controversial religious parenting book ""How to Train Up a Child."" for link(...)Christian values? I think not!"
4,Great book,"I have to respectfully disagree with the last writer. This book challenges the parent to be modeling a Christian life before expecting your children to do so and, my favorite, tying heart strings with your children. Filling them first with unconditional love and establishing clear boundaries. I gave it four stars b/c the first article is on spanking, but when you read the whole book, you see that is only in context of a joyful home. In fact, they even say don't using spanking if you're not going to do the other parts. They advocate positive parenting and not dumping your emotional issues on your children. You may not like everything, but you will certainly take away some great practical advice. I also enjoyed the follow up articles in the No Greater Joy Volumes."
1,Didn't Fit,"I bought this to replace a spigot on a glass water jug we use for parties. The opening on the jug is 3/4"". Unfortunately, this 3/4"" spigot did not fit. When I measure the spigot, it is 3/4"" without the threads. When you add in the threads, it comes out larger than 3/4"". Since it wouldn't fit the 3/4"" hole and I didn't want to hassle with returning a $4.50 product, I tried to file down the threads to make it fit, but that just made it leak. Wish it would have fit without me trying modifications."
5,Great item,I was looking for a replacement water dispenser for my 3 gallon water container. The container was in great shape but the faucet would sometimes leak. These replacement faucets worked very well and saved me from purchasing another water dispenser. The service was very fast.
4,OK,It is what it is. The original one in my pitcher was leaking so I got this. As long as this one doesn't start leaking I will be happy.
4,inexpensive,"this will not fit your berkey water purifier, it is larger than the hole in the berkey, i will keep the faucet as i can make a berkey out fo a couple of plastic buckets. other wise satisfactory to use."
3,HO street lights not what I expected,"they were much smaller than they appeared, and were cheaper made than they looked- just messy spray painted silver and black plastic posts."
2,My $20 Timex Doesn't Look This Cheap,"The strap is cloth and actually more orange than red, and the time piece itself looks plasticky and only shows the date not the day. I got it today, and it's going back tomorrow."
2,Not very good,"This was my first board and I did not like it very much. It is smaller than pro boards, almost like a board for 10 to 13 year olds. The trucks came loose as hell, and when I tightened them, they became loose as soon as I turned. All of my friends said the face looked dumb. It is not very fast either. I just recently purchased an enjoi board 31 inch, and I love it. It rides so much better than the angelboy board. Also, the enjoi board is a lot easier to balance on. O and the pop on the angelboy boy was weak."
4,Good inexpensive Easy Listening find,"For the price you get about 30 minutes of music featuring some of the classic easy listening instrumentals. Ferrante & Teicher, Liberace, Mancini and Ramsey Lewis's The In Crowd, which is 5 minutes of sheer joy. Also tops to listen to is Masekela's Grazing the Grass."
4,Non-Fiction,"This was quite enjoyable. Although of a somewhat academic bent, it avoids in most cases pure academic arch-formal scholarese meaningless sentences to produce a text that is much more interesting and readable than you might expect. So a very fine job from that point of view, if it is meant to be accessible to a more average sort of reader."
2,Too bulky,Bought this for my father and he said it was too bulky and he could not get it out of his pocket. The car charger was exactly what he wanted and works great with the phone. The case however was a loss and is now sitting in a drawer not being used.
4,Crosby's mellow baritone put's even Sinatra to shame.,"I grew up on lps of Crosby's even though he was dead before I was born. His mellow voice and clever turns of phrase puts to mind the green and beautiful countryside of Ireland. His rendition of Danny Boy cuts to the heart and would make a stone cry. Even though there was not an option to hear the Irish Eyes are Smiling song, I have heard him sing it before and can only imagine the lilting quality he puts into it. He will always be ahead of any other male performer of his era, my book."
4,Great Bargain,"Bing Crosby grew up listening to the classic Irish Tenors like McDermott as well as early jazz. The results heard on this short collection show Crosby as uniquely qualified to present the best of both worlds. Crosby approached all the songs with a very relaxed and uniquely American delivery which retained the warm round tones of the Irish tenors. Crosby's vocal approach here is straightforward and he delivers the ballads with superb emotional restraint...""Danny Boy"" is gently touching and not the least bit overwrought (many singers have a tendency to overdo the classic Irish lament). Crosby defined the popular Irish-American songbook with these gems. It's as much Brooklyn as County Clare, and great music. My only criticism here is that the cd could use more substantial documentation and maybe liner notes. I guess that helped keep the price down on this great bargain cd. The music is first rate and offers a wonderful window on Irish-American culture in the 40's and 50's."
4,"An enjoyable, if not simple read.","Granted.. I'm not sure if you can trust my opinion of such things. I'll read (almost) anything asside from smutty romance novles.I first picked this one up because I wanted to see how my favorite sci-fi author could do fantasy.. He does pretty good, but this book doesn't show that ;) (if you want to see a decent fantasy book by him, pick up Kingdoms of Light, unless you want perfectly serious fantasy.. then go get a Robert Jordan book :p)Anyways, I digress (bad habbit.. let me tell you bout bad habbits....), like others have said the book is like the old adventur games. Simple, straight forward plot. Very common character types. And a rather predictable outcome with an abrupt end. With all that said, frankly, the book is STILL better than the DnD movie!If you want a quick, enjoyable read, pick up a copy. If you want something deep that gets you attached to the characters.. Don't bother.. Try the Wheel of Time series."
3,An enjoyable read.,"I've never heard of the game SHADOWKEEP, but I found this book in a quarter bin and decided to pick it up. First off, let me say that this book reads like one of those old adventure games: very straightforward and linear. It has no plot twists or complicated character interactions. The characters move from one locale to another without having to make any really difficult decisions. Mr. Foster did an excellent job of taking these two dimensional computer game characters and bringing them to life in a vivid, enjoyable way. Their interactions with each other were amusing at times and almost poignant at others.The storyline was really simple, but thoroughly enjoyable. Good versus evil in a story where failure will result in the end of the world. Nothing deep or intellectual about it; just a romping adventure. A good book for a plane trip in that it doens't really take all that much concentration or thought to enjoy and it was very fast paced."
1,Not satisfied,"I'm like to buy a DVD with freestyle video clips and not a documentary or tv show, with enterview. All clips in this DVD have comentary in the middle of the song. I don't like and don't recommend(sorry about my english...)"
3,Good,"As a fan of Latin Freestyle, it is a great purchase. It is actually quite informative about the artists, and the response of the industry to this music genre. It brought back a lot of good memories.Personally, the production value could have been better. Then again, that's just the Communications major in me coming out. The DVD did stutter a bit towards the end, but that could have just been my player."
2,bad,"This game is really bad. That is to say, the part where you actually race is bad. The controls are sadistically unstable and the graphics of the race are primitive at best. On the other hand, the cut scenes are actual video clips of Hooters girls and are worth putting up with the race for. ... I would say this game's target audience are 13 year old boys who don't get out much."
3,not what i expected,"Could not get through this book, very weird not about what you think it is, got to about halfway and had to close it"
2,not for the beginner,"It's an odd book.According to the book's review is in between the formality of many papers and a picture oriented book.The first two lines of its table of contents are:chapter. 1 Our view of nature page. 7... chapter. 2 Fractals and power law scaling 15...36The chapter 1 is what any picture intended book on fractals has. The chapter 2, where the fun begins and basic concepts as ""power law"", ""fractal dimension"" are introduced is incomprehensible.Nevertheless it seems to be an interesting book about applications of fractals. I'm talking about ""Part III"", page > 80 to 233 (the end).It's curious and inconsistent book at the beginning: it talks to beginners in a way that is incomprehensible for a beginner!.If you are a beginner in fractals as I am, you need another book!."
3,this is some good stuff...,"I am very impressed by this soundtrack. Not only is it upbeat and exciting, but also well known rappers and singers on the album. Overall, i recommend this cd for all ages above 17, because of the lyrics. A good soundtrack behind a great movie!"
3,I see a spring time jam starting.......,"If ya looking for a tight soulful jam to kick off that cool good vibe feeling for the spring...., try ""one time"" by Jill Scott & Eric Roberson. IT IS the tightest jam on the CD. NO DOUBT!! The Roots featuring Amel Larriuex is a extra blessing to this CD. Pretty much anything Amel is on, I'm gonna give props anyway. I got to give it up to my ATL sista Monica for droppin another gem for the radio to go crazy over with the track ""just another girl"". Sticky Fingaz and Em....... you couldn't find a more twisted, mentally challenge duo nowhere in hip-hop. ""What if I was white"" is a funny track that Em & Sticky ripped apart. Everything else is something ya already heard or not worth writing about.........oNe"
1,What is the song title and Artist?,"On the preview of this movie, they play a song with the line "" money, money, money, money, MONEY"" if you know who this is ,please post the answer. Thank you."
4,Underrated,"It is a great CD, but it seems that nobody likes the ""Thug Music Plays on"" by Bone Thugs N' Harmony. It displays their R&B/Rap sound that no other rappers have."
4,Great gag gift,Great gag gift for my engineer son for his office cubicle. It will probably be used to decorate someone else's cubicle! It received a lot of laughs.
3,Not exactly what I expected,"The ""fringe"" is really just a two inch thick strip of sticker with leopard print.The disco ball is only about one inch in diameter. about the size of a keychain.I think the description called for a mousepad, but it ended up being a magnet."
1,Very disappointing,"Not what I thought it would be, did not like it at all. More like a ""joke"" type gift, I guess...."
1,Junk,"No good not new as the ad states , very old and card is long been NO Good with Dish network !Cost 13.00 $ to send it back and still NO refund .And i see he is still selling them."
5,video junkie,great service quick delivery i have never seen this before was a great movie would recommend it to any family who has a child with a terminal illness
1,wrong number of items!,This item is supposed to be 10 spools of 50feet of wire. They only send one. No one in their right mind would buy a spool of aluminum wire that costs $26.19.
4,A great game for it's price.,"This is a typical Shoot the bad guys 2d side scrolling game. It is fun with a great plot and VERY DIFFICULT, I reccomend it to anyone who is going on a trip or anything and needs a good game to keep him busy for a week, thats what I got it for."
3,A solid sidescrolling shooter,"Like Defender and other classics, in Robotech you fly, you shoot, you dodge, and that's basically it. Ok, you get to play in different ships, but the concept is the same. I saw a dude playing it on the subway the other day and it looked gorgeous on the GBA SP's sidelighted (or is it sidelit?) screen, so I knew I had to play it. It does get boring after a while and you knuckles will start hurting, but the graphics is so good that you gotta play it at least once. I'm keeping it in my library for the times I feel nostalgic about 2D shooters."
4,Very Frustrating But Extremely Fun,While most of the other reviewers say that this game is to hard or to short I think this game is very good while it lasts. I mean it is a little short if you only clear it once but try clearing it with every single character including the secrets characters and getting all their stats full. Now that might take a while.
2,Even Robotech fans will think this game is a disapointment,"First off, I really like Robotech/Macross. Unfortunately, this game is not great at all. The game can be easily finished in 30-45 mins and the levels are very repetitive. The graphics are ok and the sound is below average. There is some replay value in getting your fighter to max levels and unlocking new characters but after all the fighters are maxed out, it is very hard to tell the difference between them. The action figure that comes with the game also sucks...its completely static and can't pose at all."
3,KINDLE USERS - NO ACTIVE TABLE OF CONTENTS,"I have this book in hardback and the audible version. I wanted it on my Kindle so I can read it when I travel. There is NO ACTIVE TABLE OF CONTENTS in this Kindle version which makes it very difficult to access the many different parts.It's like having the Bible on Kindle with no active Table of Contents. How do you get to the chapter you want?The book itself, as written, is wonderful. Everyone here knows that. I just think it's important to know what kind of experience the actual reading of it will be once you get it on your Kindle. It's very frustrating and takes away the happiness I feel when I read the book."
3,A bit small...,"A really nice piece of merchandise for fans to own, however it is a bit small.I assume that is because the main aduience for this item is children, but the metal plant and size of the band make it awkward for adults or teens looking to add it to a costume. It will fit, but the band will be tight and you won't have more than an inch of excess fabric after knotting it.If possible, I think interested buyers should try to locate one of these in person to get an idea of the size if you require a larger one."
5,Best seasoning for any kind of fish!!!,I have used this spice for over 2 years now. I have never gotten a negative complaint on any fish I have used it on. It is just the right blend for Salmon and almost any other kind of fish you can fix. I just sprinkle liberally the top of my fish and bake. Yummy!
5,Best salmon seasoning ever!!!!!!!!!!,"First time we used this produce we fell in love. We eat more salmon now than ever, which is healthier. Anyone that we have over for salmon rants and raves and wants to know our secret----No secret, just Tones Salmon and Seafood seasoning. Unfortunately it is no longer available at the grocery store."
5,Seasoning,"Had a chance to try this at Thanksgiving and also Christmas. Spice steeped in virgin Olive Oil as a dip for fresh baked bread. Then Marinated with Soy Sauce and Olive oil over Skinless chicken breasts on the grill. Outstanding, If you guys at Tones are watching Please pull your heads out of your arses and put this back on the shelf. The Omachron"
3,"Works, but expensive","This 'glue' works well, but is way too expensive. I had two prior tubes dry up to where they couldn't be used anymore despite the fact that there was about 50% left in the tube. And I always put the cap back on when it's still hot and always squeeze out a little extra to get the air out. All in all, you'll probably find this whole system to be way too expensive unless you have a large project where you can use up all the tubes of glue prior to the tubes clogging up. If you need to store a used tube for an extended period of time then it'll probably be unusable when you need it."
2,It's OK when nothing else works,"I bought two of these guns for an installation in New York where I had to assemble double thick shelving panels on the site. We used the longest set time...I think it was 90 seconds, and alternated guns to get enough of the glue down fast enough to have time to adjust the assembly. For this they were indispensable and I would invest in the glue if I had to do it again. That said, they don't make any sense at all for occasional use. the glue comes with a stamped date and a shelf life of a few months. Once the tube is opened or if it goes beyond it's date, the glue tends to harden near the spout. You can push a drill bit up into the tube to free it up and sometimes it works, but more often than not you end up throwing the tube out. The guns are so cheaply made that if you need more pressure they just crap out. I just threw out my last cartridge and came looking for more, but at $9.00 for one (should be for 4) it's a ripoff.."
2,Ive Heard Better,"Its alright, there are better things out there, the best songs on it are ""Gimme back my bullets"" by the greatest southern rock band of all time,Lynard Skynard. Also, ""Copperhead Road"" is a good one too. Thats about it. I would suggest you go buy a cd by Lynard Skynard and thats it."
1,"Bad news bears, this is not the cd for me, sorry","I really like Susannahs' voice a lot. That's a big plus! I don't like this particular cd for a number of reasons. To start with, I thought the repertoire was abserd. There were very few songs on this cd that I knew, much less liked. When I found a song on this cd that I knew, it was messed up with the arrangement that was attached to it... There must be some hope out there for us ""die hard"" romantics...Recommendation: I Can Not Recommend This Cd."
4,Walking Pig,My friend who loves pigs gives this an outstanding review. She thought it was unusal and cute.Tom
5,Awesome,"I have the LP of this and am purchasing the CD now. The guitar work is unbelievable. The music has a wide range of speeds and complexity. Good, old time, down to business guitar work."
5,Great Book!,This book was awesome! I like how the authors carried the story over from the first book and continued developing the characters in the second book. I can't wait to read the third book!
2,Hoo-Haa!,"Why did I buy this book? Again the same arguements. I don't really care for Marines, the cover was stupid, too much hoo-haa. I think these books lace their pages with some kind of narcotic. They're really not that good but I keep going down the series. Who knows, maybe sometimes I just want a cheap stupid read?I give this book 2 out of 5 stars. Same problems as the first."
3,Entertaining SF military actioner,"A guilty pleasure this. A Marine based SF actioner where you get exactly what is says on the box. But having said that, this could have been a by the numbers space shoot-em-up, but the authors have tried to make it a little more then that while constrained by the fact this was never going to get the nobel prize for literature!So we have Marines acting as peace keepers on a world that has terrorist activity, a world of different factions mostly based on a Germanic culture and background. While the marines train up the local police they discover there may be a less then obvious agenda to the terrorist activity.....This does try to provide a plot and characterisation to link the action and it does work. You do get what was on the box but it is done well and if you like this sort of stuff, this is not a bad series to get into."
4,"Good story line, exellent action, and plenty of suprises.","This book was a real thriller to me. The descriptions in the battle scenes took me completely into the book itself. It was like I was there with them. The story line is great, and by that I mean that is has more than just military blood and gore. It goes into the lives of the characters as well as the battle parts. In my opinion I could never put this book down, and I got a great deal of suprise, humor, and sorrow out of it. I think it's a real winner!"
2,"Not as good as #1, or #3","I enjoyed the first book in the Starfist series so I thought I'd pick up some of the others. Unfortunatley, the second in the series ""School of Fire"" really leaves alot to be desired. Slow, predictable story line and a poor ending really make this a hard story to get through. But, if you can get through this one, the 3rd in the series ""Steel Gauntlet"" is much better, and really worth picking up. If you like the ""Marines kicking Butt in Space"" theme, this series is worth a look overall, however #2 in the series is definitely not the best."
4,Very handy device,"This is a great little device, helps me a lot in home costruction (interior work mostly). It is a bit handier than the rotary levels in that the spot is bright and can be seen well during a sunny day inside a room. I lucked out to get a clearance price of $100. I feel this product is well worth a price around $150. Complaints? none sofar, though I have only used it for a month, so any future storage issues may change my opinion of this handy device."
1,Won't buy based on customer feedback,"I appreciate the customer feedback on all the tools you provide. Based on the number of bad reviews for this product I will not buy, which is a shame, since I like (and generally buy) mostly Porter Cable tools. In fact I just purchased their crown stapler - I wonder if P.C. reads these things?"
1,laserless level,"I have had this level one and half years, using it about ten times. It worked well and saved me alot of time. My one very minor complaint would have been its long search times to find level. (Longer than others I have used.) Now I have a major complaint...after storing it in the recommended manner for five months, it will not produce a beam...it justs searches for level. The little motor hums, the little gimble indexes and I get nothing. It was working fine, no abuse, no accidents...can't recommend it now, can I?"
1,glad it's not just me,I also purchased the robotool it was great until I stored it for a few weeks and it never worked again. It's great for finding the floor the beam now points right at it
3,Deceiving remake,"I had an old robovector laser; 5 beam. It was great, and small, the size of a 30' tape measure. When it got dropped one too many times, I went shopping online, and saw the exact same look in the Porter Cable, and learned that PC bought the logo and design(?) When the darn thing arrived, it was ten times bigger!! I used to stick my RV in my nail belt, now it is the size of a bosch jigsaw!! whats the deal? I'll keep it for the crew, but looking for a small one for me. I couldn't work without a 5 beam laser, but want it on my belt."
1,Died after six months,"Product has a short life span --- avoid. We used it a few times, stored it safely in its manufacturer provided case (Porter Cable) and it died after six months. New batteries, cleaned contacts, nothing ---- the laser has a VERY SHORT life span."
1,"Run Away, Run Away!","Product worked great at first, a wonderful time-saver. Then I put it away for a year. Stored meticulous in temp- and humidity-controlled, dust-free environment. Now it won't level anymore, just churns and churns forever. What a ripoff. Save your money.While my ire is mostly for the manufacturer, Amazon should NOT continue marketing a known-defective product."
1,Expensive Bookend,"I am a home improvement contractor, so I know the improtance of taking care of ones tools (you take care of them and they'll take care of you). This product is simply ""crap-in-the-box."" After using it a whopping 3 times and storing it away for a couple of months, it simply stopped working. Four (4) blinks and then...nothing!Trying to track down someone to fix this is even more aggravating, but you know what they say about throwing good money after bad....DON'T!I'm considering buying a used one so I'll have matching bookends!!"
1,GARBAGE! DO NOT BUY,"I am a finish carpenter/cabinetmaker and I rely on accuracy. This level will make you lose sleep. After returning one with side lasers sending out two dots, this one will not calibrate the front laser to the side lasers. Can't even get within a 1/4"" at 25 feet. I just bought a PLS-5 instead. Don't waste your time with this one. You will be disappointed."
1,don't waste your money,"As other reviewers have stated, it breaks for no reason after being stored and cared for. Mine was used 4 or 5 times , stored for 3 months and will no longer level itself. The mfr. wants $85 plus shipping to get it repaired. Without any questions about what didn't work and/or what may have caused it to fail. They were totally unconcerned about the customer.I'm going to take my $85 and put it towards the purchase of a CST Berger MP5. At least they're a reputable company."
2,gave it two stars because I used it successfully twice,"I've read every review here; I agree that it is a slick tool. I will never buy another. After 6 months I needed to recalibrate. Then every 2 months it needed calibration. It completely failed shortly after the one year warranty lasped. I returned it for recalibration at half it's initial cost! Now the thing doesn't work at all. I've called the service folks and they want me to give them even MORE money to get it working. I've gone back to using string, a level, and a small weight for plumb. Honestly, don't waste your money on this thing, unless you're lucky to have plenty of money. But then, why D.I.Y.? By the way it was NEVER dropped or mishandled."
1,Make it work.....,"I got my 7610-5 as a factory rebuild, so I am not out as much as some of you. When I first got home, I thought it was broken, but after 20 mins or so, it finally leveled itself. I was able to use it on a job 1 time, but after storing it (in an air conditioned room) for a couple of months, it never worked again. Customer svc will not answer emails, and a call to the factory says they will charge $85 to fix it no matter what is wrong, maybe good, maybe bad. I really wish that I had a laser that I could rely on, but this is not it. As a remodler, my tools must work when I get to the jobsite, always. I am very disapointed, especially now that porter cable has started selling them. Every other P.C. tool that I have is excellent, this will bring down the quality of their product line."
5,INTENSE !,"This CD really blew me away! It's a twisted sort of industrial metal from my hometown in Sweden and it rocks! Distorted and hard with subtle harmonies and electronic sounding vocals. GOOD WORK!It doesn't really sound like anything else i have ever heard. It's lo-fi, hi-honest music and i keep my eyes open for future releases from this band. The rumour has it that the next CD is even more Rockbased and that would just add to my lovebombing of this extremely cool band!"
3,Cattle truck,I was a little disappointed in the quality of this item. i am not sure if it will hold up very well with a 6 year old boy playing with it. I miss the toys that were made much more durable. I am sure my grandson will enjoy it for a while.
3,Peterbilt 379 livestock truck,"I bought this truck for my son who likes to collect the die cast trucks. The front end of the truck is die cast metal but the entire back end ( trailer section) is plastic, which is junk and doesn't last. He keep the cab part and threw the trailer in the garbage."
1,Don't be misled...,"If you are looking for the Alex Honnold National Geographic video ""Alone On A Wall""-- this is not it! This is a 13 minute video that aired on 60 Minutes in October 2011. That said, it is an awesome 13 minutes."
2,"Be careful this ""DVD"" is 13 minutes long","I watched the 60 Minutes episode of ""Alone on the Wall"" when it aired and thought this DVD would have some other footage or coverage but to my dismay it really is just the 13 minute aired episode. The story still is pretty amazing if you haven't seen it but not worth the price for a 13 minute segment. There is also a National Geographic video on their website which is also called ""Alone on the Wall"" which documents Alex Honnold's story."
1,This is an interview NOT the film its titled as!,"I was very disappointed with this product as it was not what it was advertised as. I thought I was buying the Alone on the Wall DVD, NOT a 13 minute interview about it! Very misleading, especially given the price."
1,Garbage,"I will not repeat others comments. Check the other 1 star reviews.Bottom line, often technically inacurate and full of hype to pump up the authors ego.And yes, I have flown in may aerobatic contests."
1,Pure Garbage.... Sensationalized ...!,"This guy is a joke. He wrote this book to sensationalize the subject and to make a name for himself (and a few $$$).As a aerobatic competitor, I laughed out loud at some of his descriptions. He is purely in it to scare everyone away or to make him feel like a tough guy because he pulled some g's. Yippee. The goal is not to pull the most g's, it's to fly the best possible figures and link them together for the best possible sequence. This takes hard work and quite a bit of talent. This guy is a fool. Don't waste your $$$ on this book. Buy a tank of avgas instead."
1,A silly & inaccurate description of a wonderful sport,"Do not waste your money on this book. The author is a mamby-pamby pilot who has dabbled in the sport.I have spent 28 years teaching, competing in and coaching aerobatics. What this man writes is an insulting bunch of baloney."
1,This book score is a zero,The author missed a great opportunity. Competition aerobatics is a great sport. Statistically I don't believe their has ever been a death in a US aerobatic contest. But that does not make good reading. The author would rather have you believe that the world could end at any second. He missed the point and so did the editor and the publisher. This book is pure sensationalism. The title gives you and idea were the authors head is!
2,Aerobatic stories: bumpy trip through this book,"I was disappointed with this book. The topic of aerobatic pilots and their unique planes sounded like it would be a fast, smooth read. Instead, though I found myself interested in the author's brief descriptions of aeobatic flying, the balance of the book left me cold.The reader is introduced to dozens of famous aerobatic pilots but one never gets to really know any of them on a personal level. Their flying technique is well-described but I finally started feeling a detached, who-cares attitude. The book should have included some diagrams of the various aerobatic stunts to help the reader picture the stunts. Without this, I couldn't picture what was being described. Some photos of the many famous planes mentioned in the book would have been welcome too.The author is a columnist for Time magazine and herein may be the problem with this book. No Visible Horizon reads more like a collection of columns than a cohesive, well-structured book."
2,Sensationalism over substance,"Many of us in the aerobatic community feel that this book plays to sensational stereotypes of daredevil flying, which is not an accurate portrait of most aerobatic pilots. Ramo also uses faulty statistics to quantify the dangers involved, vastly undercounting the number of participants in the sport.Ramo's attitudes are the sort that get people killed, as illustrated by his anecdote of starting a downward maneuver a mere 700 feet above the ocean. In point of fact pilots who observe routine safety precautions -- like maintaining a safe altitude -- are not subject to Ramo's ""one mistake and you're dead"" mantra.There are some good books about aerobatics, but this is not one of them. Try Patty Wagstaff's ""Fire and Air"", ""Basic Aerobatics"" and ""Advanced Aerobatics"" by Szurovy & Goulian, or Alan Cassidy's ""Better Aerobatics"" instead."
2,"Self aggrandizing, and way overly sensational","There's so much misunderstanding about competitive aerobatics that the aerobatic community has an obligation to bristle at the sensationalistic and very skewed opinions of the author. Those that think these pilots are insane lunatics will definitely get their ""I told you so!"" moments in this book. The truth of the subject of this book is somewhere between the positive and negative reviews. People get killed every year performing aerobatics - all of them without exception were not competing or were airshow/stunt pilots. There's never been a fatality at an aerobatic contest owing to the extreme measures these pilot exercise to make it so. That's the main disappointment with this book. It misses the intense passion that everyday kind of people/pilots have for this sport and how they're able to muster the rare skills to do it well."
3,Good.,"I wasn't overtly impressed with Eminem's The Re-Up. Although it's got some good songs, it's just lacking, severely lacking in some places.The new artists aren't impressive, and the old ones don't give it their all. It's almost like a cash-in.If you want to hear better from these artists, I suggest you go for their solo albums (group for D12)."
3,50 is back?,"Any true hip-hop fan can tell you that fifty has fallen off since Get Rich or Die Tryin. But at least for the time being he's got my ear with this album. Eminem doesn't quite have as much relevant material as he used to but his presence on this album is enough to get it. As for the new artists, they are truly outshined by the Shady veterans. To me, the whole dirty south, ATL style doesn't mesh with Em and Fifty, so it just feels like these artists are being forced on the listener. Unfortunately the only Dre track on the entire album is a solo by Stat-Quo, but overall i would recommend this album to anyone that wants to hear some fresh, quality material from the Shady crew. When it comes down to it it's just a good filler until Nas finally drops."
3,"Good, but generally a disapointment","This was good album, like the rest of the Eminem albums. However, I found that this album did not contain the Eminem style, in fact, it was a little too gangster for an Eminem album. I was still infatuated with Eminem and D12's singles."
2,Far from great,This album will definately not go down as a classic. Very very poor production considering it includes 50 and eminem.
2,"This Album sucks, weak rappers","theres so much better ish out there, & em comes with a wack album, and whats worse everybody on here sucks, the RMX's suck, the new artist are lame, Em & 50 should have made a album together and ditch the camp, Re-Up on the dro not this album, 1 decent single and everybody thinks the albums gonna b good, these reviewers get real, pucker up, 4 what, album is garbage 2 what they can bring, shady & the unit suck A*S, until they bring heat they should shut up, jimmy crack corn but this album i dont care, put it in fire so everybody in this album can think there hot."
3,Mediocre Eminem,"I don't know if I'm getting old or if the music is getting too advanced for me, but I was disappointed with this album.Nothing beats vintage Eminem.Maybe Eminem is getting too old."
1,do not waste your money,There is only the one good song on this CD. Save your money and buy the single.
2,Dissapointment,"Hardest hitting songs are Jimmy Crack Corn, Pistol Pistol, and Public Enemy #1. The rest are either decent or below par really. Just download those 3 on I-TUnes and you have the highlights of the CD."
2,Some strengths mostly weak samples,Not the best album & not intended to be either. Go through itunes and pick what you like.
1,Eminem's New Low,"Eminem isnt much of a rapper, truly he is very overrated and overhyped to the point that even rock fans think he's the only good rapper. How sad.Eminem sounds washed up, used, and tired in this album. Just listen to him. This album was done poorly just to make money off the Eminem and G-Unit name.Not to mention, 50 Cent still hasnt done anything good since Get Rich Or Die Tryin. Same old boring stuff. Only idiots will like this album, or girls that like artists for their looks. There is nothing lyrical in this album either. I might as well go buy that Justin Timberlake album...or even worse, the K Fed album."
1,This CD sucks!!!,"I have been an Eminem fan for a long time, but I don't know what he was thinking when he released this crap. There are 2 songs on this CD that are good, and the rest all sound about the same and like crap. I hope he stops messing around with Kim and gets back to making good music that I know he is capable of making."
4,The Shady All-Stars are worth a listen,"In Dec. 2006, Eminem released ""The Re-Up,"" a collection of songs from his Shady Records roster. Those included are fan favorites Em, 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, D12 and Obie Trice. In addition, Em introduces the world to Stat Quo, Ca$his and Bobby Creekwater. ""No Apologies,"" is by far the best track on the album and just happens to be a song by Em himself. But don't let that think others don't shine. This album has solified my decision to buy the debut from Stat Quo, titled ""Statlanta,"" when it is released in 2007. Ca$his has a good flow, but I'm not yet sold on him and Bobby Creek just yet. If you're looking for some new Eminem, you will get it here. He shows up on 7 tracks and they are all good. The album is a good collection of remixes and the Shady camp. Look out for Dr. Dre's ""Detox,"" Stat Quo's ""Statlanta,"" and Eminem's new album, reportedly a double album next year."
4,Vital Radiance Brow Powder,I have very sparse eyebrows and this is the only product that really works for me; I can use it both dry and wet and I can also mix the two colors together to make a perfect match.
5,A much-needed look at an often-ignored medical topic,"I very much recommend ""Invisible Illnesses."" Too often, I think health and recovery books are written by practioners, and so have an extremely limited (and frequently, somewhat patronizing) point-of-view. There just aren't enough books written from patients' perspectives, and so, this book is a welcome find. It's full of lots of practical strategies for dealing with any sort of complicated and frustrating medical diagnosis. It also--impressively so, considering that the author is recovering from a truly horrific accident--has a strong sense of hope. As someone attempting to rehabilitate from a probably-permanently disabling injury herself, it's refreshing to me to read a book that not only is very honest--but also presents a ""yes, you actually can survive terrible, life-altering events"" attitude.This book is a great choice for anyone suffering from a chronic illness, injury, disability, and/or other daunting life challenge."
4,A wonderful personal account with wise suggestions.,"Sharon has an insider's advantage on invisible illness. She bares her soul and isn't shy about confronting the things that worry all of us with chronic illness or disabilities (such as feeling competent, wondering what our friends and family think of us, and how body image effects sex). Her suggestions come from personal experience, well studied out. I give it a warm welcome to my shelf of books on chronic illness and disability."
1,May I be the first person to say: NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!,"I'm a sicko of a Yes fan. I own all their albums on vinyl, bought them again on cassette in the 80s, and bought them again on CD in the 90s. But I've got to draw the line somewhere.How many freakin times can a band re-release the same ""greatest hits"" with a different cover? When I was notified by Amazon of a new Yes album, I jumped all over it thinking, ""the boys are back for the first time in 7 years!"" But no, it's more like ""the boys have released their 7th greatest hits CD in 7 years.""PLEASE DON'T ENCOURAGE THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR! Don't buy this album or it'll just make them do it again, and again, and again. If we all boycott future Yes greatest hits albums, then maybe they'll be forced to actually WORK for their money. I think we'd all enjoy that for a change. WHO'S WITH ME??"
2,Not for the diehard Yes fan,"""Magnification"", Yes' last studio effort shows that the boys still have what it takes to produce brilliant, inspiring, and worthwhile music. (IMHO ""In the Presence Of"" ranks right up there with the all-time Yes greats.) However, we don't need yet another rehashing of the past (no matter how great the music is). Members of Yes: please give your long-time fans at least one more album of new material to further assure your musical legacy. I gave this CD a rating of two stars because it could be valuable to new fans, but it will not satisfy the hard-core Yes fans who need some fresh original music from their favorite group."
4,Retrospective compilation,"As compilation CDs go, this two-disc collection incorporates music from Yes' long and diverse career. Both CDs run just under 80 minutes. The first disc covers the early albums, dating from 1969-1973. This was the time when the band evolved their signature sound: long, often meandering progressive pieces, with complex melodic and key changes, and strong classical influences. This style was sometimes criticized for being too ornate and ethereal, but it was unique and distinctive. The second disc spans more recent material, in which the band underwent repeated personnel changes, and adopted more of a song-oriented format. As a result, the second disc is less coherent. Still, on balance, this is a good collection for listeners who don't want the original albums."
1,Complete ripoff; avoid,"As was stated before, this is just ""Ultimate Yes"" with different packaging. If it was possible to give this no star instead of one, I would, but the Amazon rating system doesn't let you rate anything a zero (or lower). Go to Rhino's Website and e-mail them the thumbs-down!"
3,Real cretu-like but not supprising,"In the 80's Cretu also composed for the German female singer Sandra (nowadays his wife). This album is quite similar to the albums of Sandra. Therefore not a very big supprise if you know these. But still, Cretu has his own style and usage of instruments. Very German. Rigid digital sounds. Nice to listen to if you want to hear Cretu's musical development. Nowadays he is known under the name Enigma."
5,A Fortuitous Error..,"WOW! I have always loved Enigma and have all the releases. In the music store last week, I was looking through the Enigma section and found this CD. I was NOT paying attention, as my 6 year old was running around and I did not notice this was a different artist. I started listening to the CD in my car enroute to work and fell in LOVE!! I am reminded of things, some late 80's rhythms, some Giorgio Moroder feel (like the soundtrack to Midnight Express). What a great 'oops' on my part. I went to Borders to find more music and found another group TransAtlantic Airwaves (or something like that -- haven't memorized it yet). Give me MORE.........."
1,No need to get this CD fan or not.,"2nd worst CD I ever bought. As Enigma's fan waiting for Cretu next release, I bought this in the mean time to soften the wait. Men this is flat out weak and a waste of money, import cost more. Cretu's vocals are limited in his Enigma series. I thought a CD with more of his vocal would be great, but it is very uninspiring and lame. The instrumentals and sounds in the background are just bland. There was simply no chemistry between anything. I listened to it once and try to again without much success. I couldn't find a single track worth listening to. I thought I was a hard cord Cretu's fan, but this proves I will never be. Keep this in Europe and not over here in the State."
1,Error in Purchase,It was not what I was looking for.I was looking for more contentI purchased in error.Thank You
1,Disapointment!,"I was terribly disapointed when I discovered that this dictionary was NOT printed in the english language. It was printed in the english alphabet, but reading and trying to find a definition was like reading a foriegn tongue. Thankfully it was not that difficult to remove from the Kindle.A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary: For The Use Of Students (1916)"
2,Poor Dictionary,Poor dictionary!I thought it would be helpful but it is impossible to find a lot of words.Save your money and get a better one even if this means to spend a few more bucks
3,not what I expected,I ordered this expecting more than what was actually being offered. Since it was no charge I guess no loss
5,Quite Useful,"A good little dictionary for Old English students. I got it on Kindle for a good price, and have found it quite useful. In the small world of OE dicts, this is 2nd or third place of what is even available in any downloadable or print format."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I think I may be misunderstanding the use of this dictionary, I was needing something to define normal everyday words and did not find this very useful at all."
1,Anglo Saxon Dictionary,Too bad! I didn't know what I was ordering and didn't realize that it is more of a scholarly work than a simple dictionary. I think it is likely a very good thing for someone who has use for it
2,What can you say about a dictionary?,"Not much to say about a dictionsary. I use it some, but not enought to give it much of a rating."
1,Not The Best,I really didn't like this version. If I were you I would save your money and buy a different dictioary.
4,Great! some words are missing though...,"I used this to read Beowolf and it worked great. Some of the words I wasn't sure of showed up here, however some words are missing. It happened 2 or 3 times doing my reading. I had to search it on the internet to find what it was. However, you can't argue with that right? It's free! people who need a dictionary like this should get this one. but if you're looking for a ""english dictionary"" please go look somewhere else, this isn't what you're looking for.If you want to buy the hardcopy... don't! if you're looking for one... choose something else other than this. If you're getting the digital version... sure. why not. it's free."
2,Not suitable for Kindle,"Though a useful dictionary for very old and obscure words, it is practically useless on the Kindle since it can't be searched."
3,CONCISE ANGLO SAXON DICTIONARY,"GOOD REFERENCE WORK. MANY MORE SUCH REFERENCE BOOKS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, AND UNIVERSITY POST GRADUATE STUDENTS."
1,OOPS,"haven't been able to utilize it, as it did not have the type of information I wanted. But it was free so not a hardship. I am not a go to person to know it's use as I wanted to find old words for bible based words I did not understand. this did not work for that. If I had obtained it for student use perhaps it might have worked. I had not that type of words to try it out with."
1,Not very useful,Very difficult to navigate. Still trying to find something for my Kindle Fire that is as easy to use as the ap I have on my iphone.
4,Review of A Concise Anglo Saxon Dictionary for the Use of Students,"This dictionary works well once you understand how to use it in kindle fashion, which, unfortunately, you have to do by trial and error. After about one week of using it, I figured out a method of using the ""Search through this book"" option by typing in the word I needed to look up and then going to the entry number for the word best suited to my query. Although it's a bit cumbersome, it's great, for free, and full of entries."
5,This is a recording,"This is the single version of ""Instanbul(Not Constantinople)"", which is one of They Might Be Giants most popular songs. In addition to the regular version of ""Istanbul"", there is also a pretty cool extended remix of that song. There are also three previously unavailable ""b-sides"". The great ""James K. Polk"" became a popular concert staple. (It was rerecorded several years later for theFactory Showroomalbum.) ""Stormy Pinkness"" is a short song that is nothing special. ""Ant"" is a pretty good song. Recommended to They Might Be Giants fans."
5,Multi-layered Story that Needs to be Heard,"This is a great book. It's does not portray that Palestinian experience in a black & white way - it shows different reactions to the occupation and the consequences of those reactions. I loved the recurring theme of ""Sink in the mud Palestine."" That theme is sort of the antithesis of the romantic Palestinian reaction - it shows the disappointment and the acceptance of defeat. Absolutely wonderful and rich literature."
4,Truth Be Told,Mr Von Daniken volunteered a great deal of his time researching this subject. I applaud his effort and determination when so many said he was wrong. The book deals with evidence of our being contacted by outer beings. He gives written thoughts and ideas plus photos to back what he writes. I enjoyed the book and would not mind being in person to see the evidence myself. I would recommend this book to all who share a common interest and would like to know more about this subject.Amazon.com is where I found this book plus many books on this and other subjects. Thank you Amazon for offering me one place to shop when looking for books plus various other items.
4,"Good book, poor value","I liked the book, and bought Good's ""Common errors in statistics"", but ""Resampling methods"" went straight back to Amazon. It is too introductory for my needs - which is to say, I am past college - and overpriced. Consider Efron and Tibshirani (1993), and be sure to check out the outstanding ""Applying Contemporary Statistical Techniques"" by Wilcox."
4,A good Higgins book,Typical Higgins that will keep you intrested from start to finish. This will require some set aside time for reading.
5,3 Crime Thrillers which Serve there Purpose.,"Reservoir Dogs: 5 Stars, the Perfect Crime Thriller. The Greatest directorial debut of All Time (yes, better than Citizen Kane) and, simply put, one of the Greatest movies of All Time.Suicide Kings: 4 Stars, Highly Underated thriller that deserves to be more Widely Seen (as does a lot of Sean Patrick Flannery's work eg. ""Body Shots"" and ""The Boondock Saints""). Exception cast make a good film Great.Killing Zoe: 3 stars, a downer but still efective. Eric Stoltz and Julie Delpy can make Anything watchable.In Conclusion, 3 very worthy thrillers to add to Any Self Respecting movie fans collection."
2,Not for me.,I don't like this set. I like crime but these were not for me. I will probably give them away.
5,Diary of An Airborne Ranger: A LRRP's Year in the Combat Zone,I was wanting to hear more about personal experience of combat in Vietnam.I wanted to compare my own experiences and found what I was looking for!I would perhaps have liked the Author to elaborate more on Practices and Procedures and lessons learnt!
4,Please correct the subtitle,"Could you guys please get the name of the book listed correctly, at the top of your listing for it? The subtitle is not ""A Lurp's Year in the Combat Zone"", it is ""A LRRP's Year in the Combat Zone"".Please do not post my review; I have not read the book, so my guess of four stars is just a guess. This was just the easiest way I could think of to notify you that you need to correct the name of the book on your site."
4,Merlin Effect,"The Merlin Effect is a great book that includes a fantasy, mystery, and a adventure all in one!

When Kate and her family are swallowed by a whirlpool wierd events start to happen including Kate's dad and Isabella, a marine biologist who came along on the trip, are captured by a sea witch. The story has an exciting ending with a surprizing twist."
1,"Does nothing, don't waste your money!","OK, well I gave this a shot but it did nothing, ok maybe it reduced sensation by 5% but that's it. Garbage, don't buy this."
3,Desensitizer,"We received this product in a quick manor. The product helps fairly well, it could do a better job with desensitation."
2,Oh well,I did not like it it did not work for me. I only use the suggested amount maybe if i apply more it may work. It just was not what i expected.
5,Definitely works,"This stuff does work...I think the sensitivity of your ""thing"" as well as the size of it determine how much of it you need to use-I personally have to use quite a bit. Have your significant other work it in for a few minutes, then have at it. I could still feel everything I was doing but no PE. Word of advice though, if you use a lot you may have to wash it off before you can climax-I did."
1,it doesn't works,this product doesn't work and it is a completly waste of money and it doens't do what says in the envelop
1,JUNK,"JUNK JUNK JUNK..... This stuff is pure garbage did not help in any way,shape,or form. Glad it only made me waste 5 bucks.. PLUS IT GAVE ME A BURNING UNCOMFORTABLE SENSATION."
4,"Lovely, elegant, superb swingin....","I have only heard one cut from this date on radio and immediately perked up to find out who could weave such perfection. When I heard it was Buddy Defranco and Dave McKenna I thought, of course, who else! To this day in my opinion Buddy Defranco is totally unmatched in magic to render the purity of a great tune, in this case Ellington-Strayhorn's ""Something to Live for"", played here with total empathy,love and inner jazz by just the right pair. This date very remeniscent of Buddy's 1956 sessions with Art Tatum and Buddy Rich. We're so lucky to have guys of such quality playing today.I've just added this one to my wish list.-Bill"
2,Okay...,"Raven's Point was a bit of a pointless book- but if you're into the gruesome/horror/confusing types of stories, I guess it was okay (and only okay). It's basically about a small island that is slowly being destroyed by an ancient (confusing and unexplained) evil that has come back after centuries. Four teenagers must try to do what their past lives did not suceed at: destroy the evil forever with their (odd, confusing, unexplained) powers before it destroys their town (again). Quite gory, gruesome, and chilling for a thunderstormy night read- but there is a bit of a plot lack so I won't suggest looking forward to any big twists or anything you haven't predicted."
1,Silly with a badly developed plot and too much gore.,"I found this book rather pointless. The plot was poorly developed, with not enough background given for the development of the ""evil"" that was out to get everyone. The ""special powers"" the main characters had were incredibly silly, and confusing as well! Not to mention, this book had too much gore that did NOTHING to further the plot. What happened to Melinda Metz? Roswell High and Fingerprints were so good... among my favorite series ever... and now THIS!"
1,Eeew.,"This book was so disgusting. I don't know how I finished reading it. It's about teenagers on an island. They have to fight an evil that lingers there from centuries before. Not only was this book unnecessarily violent and gruesome and gory but the plot was ridiculous. The ""evil"" was never explained, where it came from, why it's evil, etc etc etc. Also the teenagers' powers were extremely silly and the conclusion was ridiculous and unsatisfying. I can't recommend this book to anyone!"
2,cagney on cagney,Not well written. Jumps around a lot. Expected more from this great actor than he revealed in his book
1,Cagney Fan,"James Cagney was one of my favorite actors but I'm sad to say that I didn't enjoy this book at all. I looked forward to reading it because it was coming from Mr. Cagney himself. Unfortunately, I found it very boring. I struggled to get through half the book and put it away without finishing it. The book was written like a speech where the writer went off topic numerous times."
3,"Well written, but too depressing","Like all the Heartland books, this one was good, but I was a little disapointed with it. It had a good ending, but I felt like the plot was a little overdone and got kind bored towards the middle. But don't let this book keep you from reading the others! I think the rest of Lauren's books are much better and a little more realistic. But this one is still worth reading."
5,Great Horse book,"Super book for horse lovers like me who love all the Heartland books. I can't get enuff of them! If you love Heartland, you'll also love teh book Shadow Horse which is about rescued animals, too and has a mysterie."
3,not one of the best books from Heartland,I liked this book but it was not one of the best ones. Amy Flaming runs a farm called heartland she heals the scars of emotionally injured horses. But when Prince Gallant comes to heartland Amy simply can't pull him out of his darkness. The stallion fears everyone and everything. But when amy finds out that prince's old stable hand Ryan is going thourgh the same pain she knows that he is the only one who can reach Prince. For horse lovers everywhere Out of the darkness is an emotional exciting book that display the relationship of a human and horse working together even in times where everything seems losted.
5,Great!,"I think the book was great! Amy is trying to help a race horse named Gallant Prince who was caught in a fire. Ever since the fire, nobody has been able to get near Prince so they send him to Heartland. After lots of working with Prince and having no success, Amy decides to contact the old stable Hand that used to work at the Stable where Prince lives. He and Prince had a very speacial bond with each other and Amy Thinks he will be able to help. Well, I wont say anything more because I mite give away what happens at the end. By the way, for all the people who were expecting this book to be alot about Amy and Ty's relationship, well, the book was more about the horses than Ty."
2,"If Trefil really has the facts, why does he need to abuse logic???","Co-author Trefil's pro-choice ideology got in the way of his using his common sense.To make a long story short, Trefil writes that scientists can manipulate eggs, in order to cause them to develop into embryos. Therefore, he posits, eggs are somehow equivalent to embryos.Trefil ""forgets"" to mention that there is a BIG difference between a manipulated egg and an unmanipulated egg...just as there is a BIG difference between a fertilized egg and an unfertilized egg.Trefil outlandishly concludes that, since this manipulation of eggs into embryos is possible, pro-life women who shed unfertilized eggs each month should be concerned that they are actually having abortions.It's hard to get more ""unscientific"" than this! Don't forget to put on your ""thinking cap"" when you enter Trefil's world."
1,a scientific attempt to distort the quality of life,"In brief, the following book tends back the pro-choice movement with cheap opinionated evidence of science. It attempts to supersede Gods law, and replace it with mans law. Additionally, the book conveys a grave an immoral message to its readers.Contrary to natural law, it states that by petty scientific proof, society can determine whether a fetus is human or not. Obviously, this book chooses to disregard Gods message-""It is immoral to produce HUMAN embyros intended for exploitation as disposable biological material"". Not only is it futile to misinterpet the above, but it is simply a crime for pro-murderous writers to generate wimpy, relitivistic propoganda intended to distort the human race."
4,"Good fiberloft, but overpriced",Used some of this to help fill driver for my headphones. Works pretty good but I feel it was overpriced for the size you get.
2,Her western historicals are far superior!,"I've read two of this author's western historical romances, and enjoyed them both. However, this is the first of her series titles I've read (the other was the third in this series - WITH A LITTLE T.L.C. - and both struck me as rather juvenile and unrealistic.Why is Southwick's writing so different in those historicals than it is in these series titles? I'm guessing it has to do with the line requirements, but it saddens me that an author who can write such good historicals is now only writing fairly bad series titles.Please do yourself a favor and pass this one by, but, if you can find either, instead buy WINTER BRIDE (a good mail order bride romance) or BLACKSTONE'S BRIDE. Both are for grown-ups.Then again, if you're looking for a romance to give a 12-year-old girl, this one might work just fine.TTFN, Laurie Likes BooksPublisher, All About Romance"
5,Simply Wonderful!,I sank into this book as if it were a warm bubble bath. I loved every moment. It's exactly the kind of story that lets me forget about my own problems for awhile. Do yourself a favor and get this honey of a book.
1,"messy, messy, messy!","when applied to lids, it looks great - color is rich. BUT, just after 10 minutes, the color starts to get flaky and gets all over your cheeks. when your eyeliner is black, this isnt pretty. the brown didnt seem to be as flaky but the black was a disaster. think twice before buying this."
3,the compact shadow is better,"I found a little inconvinient to use the loose power eye shadow, the package is small, but it is not portable since it is a loose powder"
3,Eyeliner doesn't stay put,I like the idea of it. I found by the end of the day it flaked off in a powder. I had black powder flakes on my cheeks! Doesnt stay well.
2,BE Let Me Down,"A confirmed makeup flirt, I decided to try this Liner Shadow in Sugar Plum as I have loved all my previous BE purchases.Sugar Plum flaked all over my cheeks and into my eyes. So much for Sugar Plums dancing in my head.Will not buy or recommend this product."
4,Shimmery not Matte,"I ordered this because of the black reddish shade. I have green eyes and wanted a dark liner that highlighted that. I've used the black liner shadow before and thought that I'd give this a try. Its nice, but I was expecting a matte color and this is shimmery. It does wear off, but I've always had problems with that. The color is nice, just not as matte and intense as I would have hoped. I've been using it as a darker eye shadow instead and I will get something matte next time."
3,This was my PhD dissertation,I was just fooling around with Google and ran across this reference from 1986. It just goes to prove Amazon does indeed have an index to almost everything!
3,"Not her best ""Best of""","For those who want dance/party mixes, get this album. While Reach is inspiring, this album is filled with a LOT of remixes that may work for a dance party, but don't do much while listening at home or in a car."
4,Real good cd,"I have been a Gloria fan for years.This is a real good cd.There were a few songs I could have done without,like the song music of my heart with nsucks I mean nsinc.Overall the cd is very good and I recommend it highly"
2,it's ok - but thin,"sorry, i just find this album to be a bit of a raw dealgloria's classic tracks are all those '80s faves - dr beat, rhythm is gonna... all on her first gr8est hits. this one has nothing much on it, the songs are good enough, but the album material overall just doesn't seem to add up to much value somehow. saying that, her album tracks generally i love.I think the best of gloria since the '80s is all in her cuban music, that is brilliant, tracks like mi voy, mas allas, regress a mi, la pretendo, renacer, si voy a perdete, la paranda, etc, to me, that is true-gloria."
1,Shallow sequel,"Homely Estefan is a weak vocalist with no talent to speak of. She can't dance, she can't sing well, and she's nothing to look at. She and J-Lo are the worst examples of modern ""superstars"". They both get by on the flimsiest of talent. In J-Lo's case, it's her artifically pumped up rear end. Anyway, here we have a bunch of vacuous non-songs, even worse than the first volume. At least that had one decent tune, ""Words Get in the Way"". This doesn't even have that many good songs. And what's this retread of ""Conga"" doing here? Yuck! It was bad enough in the original version. My true rating: ZERO STARS."
2,Not Really Hits,"If this was a CD with a title like ""Random Stuff From Gloria"" I would give it 3 stars and a good listenable CD with a couple of good songs and worth owning.However, as it is called Greatest Hits, would have to give it 1 star. There are no hits and even new songs. New songs do not belong on a greatest hits CD.If she wanted to put out a CD of just remixes that would be good too. This is not that. It is just a big mess of random stuff."
4,Rivers Back At The Whisky,"I picked this cd up because I wanted to sample Johnny Rivers Live, as he would be in a small show. The CD was great for that, acouple of songs weremissing thatt I wanted to here but the songs that were there were done well.I enjoyed that Johnny Rivers played with some of the songs and really gave you the live feeling of being there.Sound is hard on live CDs and there are a couple of spots where either the pick up was off or Johnny turned his head and it is soft, but other than that it was great."
5,Back at the Whiskey,"I have about 25 Johnny Rivers albums on CD and vinyl and this one ranks near the top. It is performed live (not like the early fake live at the Whiskey A GoGo albums.) The band is stellar and they play Johnny's standards plus some great new covers like ""Sea of Heartbreak"", ""The Letter"" and ""Can't Find My way Home"".I didn't know that this album existed until I saw ""Sea of Heartbreak"" on You Tube last month. I am about 10 years late,but I am glad I found this under-promoted and under-rated record."
5,The Legend!,"The Legend is back.I love the CD, just on time. Mr. Rivers is impeccable, one of the best guitar player ever. His voice takes you to heavens. I love ""Back at the Whyskey"". Hope see more of Johnny!"
3,Okay shirt,"I love the graphic, that's why I bought the shirt. But the sleeves are cut sort of oddly and the shirt doesn't fit as well as most women's cycle shirts. But it's an okay short for quick rides on a hot day. The vendor was great and I will definitely order more from them in the future."
3,size,I ordered a medium after reading other reviews stating the sizes come up small. This is not the case as the medium is too big and a small (my regular size) would be perfect.
2,Bike bell not my cup of coffee,"I bought this bell for my husband's new Schwinn ""Coffee"" bike. It is much smaller than I imagined and not very sturdy with a whimpy ring. A very cute idea but not well-made. (The two stars are for the cuteness factor.)"
5,Cutest Little Bike Bell I've Ever Seen!,"I bought this for my cruiser restoration project. I ordered the mini tea pot. It arrived before all the other items I'm using to get my old bike looking new again. Now I'm as anxious as ever to get this project under way. It is so adorable and appears to be well made. It is a bit smaller than a traditional bike bell, but it has a pretty loud ring to it. I'm very pleased, I may have to order more to give as gifts."
4,Loved the sophisticated coolness,"This music will transport you to a special sophisticated, mellow coolness that makes you move to the music. Really liked it especially driving around this city of Houston."
3,amazon ROCKS!,"I purchased these for my mother for christmas, when I received them they were really small for a grown women, child size really. I had absolutely no problem with returning them and getting a refund, minus the $ 3.95 shipping. I was very, very impressed with how efficient amazon handled my return and how quickly I received my refund, within two weeks. I will diffenitly continue to shop with amazon, however, I will be a little more cautious and read the description a little slower."
1,Very poor qualiity.,"bad quality closure.I was very disappointed when I received them. I thought they were of poor quality, the latch on one side was very loose, and the other side was very stiff (hence the bending of the shape)"
5,Helpful prayers,"Life has a way of throwing curveballs at us. When we feel we know everything, something strikes us back. With this Novena I have been able to find my better self. I highly recommend this prayer book."
2,Dissappointing,I am not an Opera aficionado and I just received my double CD today but...it seems as though at least 75% of this 2-CD set is strictly instrumental. Some songs - absolutely no singing. I could listen to regular classical music on the radio. I should have researched more before buying. Buyer beware - listen to the samples.
3,Cyclone Tracy - Schlock!,"Must say that this album is not as good as the debut One Eyed. Seems the band fell apart after this album and with good reason cos it was way too different to the first one. Best songs are EMO classic Come Around while although different is still catchy punky and cutting edge hard rock. The cover of the Kiss song War Machine is also a hightlight while the slower Strange also deserves mention. All up not as good song wise as One Eyed. Guitarist Steve ended up quitting the band because of the trendy Korn direction that followed, that most fans agreed was quite fake compared to the Skid Row influence that Cyclone Tracy were best known and loved for. Certainly one of the best kick ass bands from Australia when they were switched on."
1,Cap won't stay adjusted.,"The cap has a strap that loops through a keeper on one side, but they should have provided a keeper on the right side. The cap won't stay adjusted without it but just keeps getting looser and looser. I was able to correct this by adding a keeper/slider on the right side, but that should have been provided with the cap.Don't order unless you are prepared to ""fix"" what the manufacturer left out."
2,"Good Quaility, not as advertised","I am usually very happy with all my purchases, however I do feel that I need to let people know that this item is a good quality hat however it says that it comes with a flag patch and it did not. The only reason that I picked this item is because it came from Amazon and came with a patch, so I am disappointed that it did not."
3,Decent - No velcro on back of hat,Like the way the hat fits. I normally wear a size 7. No Velcro on the back of the that I received. Lightweight construction.
3,Decent hat for the money,"Picked up the hat through another distributor, and was a little disappointed with how cheaply made the hat was. All in all it was a ""you get what you pay for"" kind of purchase. Over all that hat has held up fine and for the money you can't beat it for just knocking around. One interesting thing I will note is that draws a ton of attention in the civilian world. Army enlisted constantly get pissed off and make snide comments to me while officers seem to like it...guess there in lies the problem ahaha.Civilians for the most part think it is homemade and generally ask me stuff like why are wearing a hat with an American Flag velco patch? or why does your hat have velcro all over it? I just smile, and go on about my business. On a few rare occasions I have had guys ask me where to get one and those.Overall it gets a 3 star review because it is cheap, but hey you get what you pay for."
5,"lush, lovely and luminous","THE GODDESSES OF KITCHEN AVENUE is a lush, lovely and luminous celebration of human resilience and forgiveness. If you are a Barbara Samuel fan, you will love this book. If you are not, this book will turn you into one."
5,super read,"love this book! full of archetypes and heroines, but all women who not only survive but thrive."
1,Just couldn't get into it.,"I started reading this book, and it just didn't grip me. I found it boring, and very depressing. The description of the characters is extremely vague. The narration of the story changes between the characters making for an extremely confusing read. I know others have liked this book, but it just wasn't my cup of tea, as it read to me as a rough draft instead of a polished final product."
3,An enjoyable read...,"Goddesses of Kitchen Avenue is more women's lit than romance, which means it is more about women finding ""themselves"" than finding love, although there is still a smidgen of romance. The book is really about the stories of two women who live on Kitchen Avenue, but it is written as though it is about the stories of four women who live on Kitchen Avenue. The extra two stories are completely superfulous to the book, which detracted from my overall enjoyment of the book. The book is moving, sometimes trite, but always enjoyable.I wish it wasn't two conjoined stories and had more romance, but overall it is a well-written, solid read."
5,Completely absorbing read,"I found this a thoroughly absorbing read - in fact, I stayed up reading until 3 am because I couldn't put it down. The writing is lyrical, poetic and sensual, yet grounded in reality and never over the top artsy. The three central female characters all had problems that resonated with my experience, and all the characters (including the men) seemed very real, well rounded individuals. These are *not* cardboard characters marching through plot complications. The book is at heart a love story about permanent attachments - to men, to children, to friends, as well as to one's ""proper job"" (as Dorothy Sayers put it). I highly recommend it. I would also add, don't read a lot of the earlier reviews -- they give away too many things, and some of the reviewers apparently read a whole nother book. Five stars plus."
2,Squirrel and Critter Blend Food,Thought this was going to be fantastic for the squirrels and other animals behind my home...to be honest they do not really like it...not sure why but they definitely are not eating it...have tried different places to see if that was the problem but still as per some of the other reviews they are not eating it. Really a shame...I am no longer in England but Pennsylvania
2,ORDINARY,THIS PRODUCT IS ORDINARY BUT PRICEY. FOUND THE SAME PRODUCT WITH MORE POUNDAGE FOR MUCH LOWER PRICE AT ONE OF MY LOCAL FEED STORES BUT TOO LATE TO HELP ME.
2,The birds like it,"My squirrels don't like this either, but the birds do and it's too expensive to just buy it for the birds."
5,B52's Time Capsule CD,GREAT walk through the bands history - has ALL the songs you might want from their past!
3,Disappointed,I found the sound quality of the CD very poor. But it was only 5 bucks. I would have paid more for better sound.
5,52's a nice collection,"Well worth the price at Amazon, a nice collection and Love Shack is the best one but all are neat if you like the group.."
2,dissappointed,I expected songs other than Love Shack to be better but I wasn't really a B52 junkie. Love Shack on a good car stereo-big fun
2,Straight Stereo to SACD not worth the effort,"No multichannel reproduction. Sounds almost exactly like a straight CD or analog Vinyl. Piping sound through two channels sounds the same no matter what format. Too much information being blended together.This really should have been done in multichannel. There is a lot going on musically and vocally in this album and deserved better treatment tham the stereo transfer. Any stereo transfer I have listened to on SACD sounds like the regular CD.Did not realize this was not multichannel or would not have bought it. I have ""The Stranger"" by Billy Joel in SACD and it is multichannel and exceptional to listen to.This one is not, unless they re-do it in multichannel I would pass completely on buying it in SACD format"
2,misleading blurb,"Gak. The blurb on the back is misleading. Sure there are a couple of Galactics wandering around in human host, but they never do anything special beyond suggestions to their host. The book ends abruptly with the teaser of what I thought the book was going to be about. The book focuses on several unsavory characters (tortuers) as our hero tries to avoid them and complete his seemingly hopeless quest. Pointless quest is more like it. Our hero remains an insignificant dupe and I couldn't care less about him. Ugh, the book was painfull to finish and I wish I hadn't picked it up."
3,Ethereal God/Aliens,"A strange tale of a galactic entity marooned on Babylonian Earth. It explores concepts of deity and religion, and it seems to offer an origin myth for monotheism. Alphanumeric puns abound. The mythohistorical details are engrossing, but the New Age ethereal beings are alienating. Pretender was fun to read, but in the end dissatisfying."
1,Not Bad But A Weak Attempt,"I love Depeche Mode. I have for quite a long time, and they can put out some awesome remixes. Sadly, many of their best remixes are not here.I do hope DM intends to put out another box set like this and includes some of the remixes they left off (read: all of the remixes they left off). Disc 1 and 2 are all right, but the choice of remixes leaves MUCH to be desired. Some are standards, some are flat out crap. The bonus disc, #3, fairs a bit better. The alt ""People are People"" remix by Sherwood is a total waste. Better left on the cutting room floor.Seriously, DM needs another set of remixes. This box set doesn't do them justice and will leave most fans flaccid.One Star out of Five."
4,a small selection,"only ten songs, but a nice array of artists. this will never go down as a classic but an okay representation of the genre"
3,Good idea flawed in execution,"A good idea to analyze the corps commanders who commanded the major elements of the army of the potomac. Unfortunately rather than describing what they did and then analyzing their performance, too often Taaffe simply gives his conclusions about their performance and competence. The reader who lacks an in-depth familiarity with the war's battles is left with a conclusion unsupported by evidence. The best parts of the book are where he does give this evidence, for example, in dealing with Burnside and Hooker."
2,Seemed good at first...,"It is poor characterization when the characters switch alliances in the blink of an eye... or at least it seems that fast because the passage of time is not at all communicated except at the end of the novel when someone mentions that they have been at Takis for a year.Plenty of plot holes as well. Like for instance, there were still jumpers around at the start of the novel. Why didn't Tach do a 3-way jump with someone so he didn't have to travel to Takis in Kelly's body... like an extremely powerful ace... The Great and Powerful Turtle comes to mind. He could have gone to Takis and cleaned house instead of spending most of his time in the maternity ward.Finally, the ending was not very good. There was no real payoff to all the soap opera meandering of the first 90% of the novel... a quick space battle and a phantom menace style raid on Blaise's hq. Insert plot twist that anyone would have seen coming. Done."
3,Super Reader,"This is definitely the worst Wild Cards novel. Pretty much completely and utterly Tachyon focused again. Blaise, a psycho who now decides being a conqueror would be a good idea, steals Tachyon's ship Baby and heads for Takis. Yep, he's crazy.The whole Jumper thing sees Tachyon in the body of a woman, and Blaise can do whatever he likes to such a vulnerable creature. Rape, impregnate, the whole deal. And on Takis, women are definitely second class citizens.So, some Takisian politics and intrigue, a look at the background of Xenovirus Takis-A, and of Jubal the odd joker who isn't a joker."
1,Trash by Melinda Snodgrass. The rest of the series is great.,"I love the wild-card series. I hated Double Solitaire.The wild card series is a mosaic plot - a collection of authors writing about the same world. It worked great with the Man Kzin Wars (friends of Larry Niven) and in Wild Card Books 1-9.Unfortunately, this book isn't a mosaic novel. Even less forturnate, Melinda Snodgrass is the author. Ms Snodgrass is better suited to writing cheap romances or mercenary soldier books. She should never have been let near this plot. The wild card talent in this book is rape, physical and mental. Naturally, the physical rapes described in loving detail. Dr. Tachyon is transformed from a flawed hero-type into woman-as-victim. My reactions went from impatience to distaste and finally to boredom. Couldn't finish the damn thing. This book will appeal to friends of the author - maybe.Get the series, get the black trump trilogy, but skip this one."
4,awesome,"These are the coolest boxers every I had them for a couple of years now so yes they passed the test of time, I'm gonna buy some more soon :-)"
4,Great book for actors!,"I'm a young actress! I found this book, no one had reviewed it, so I decided to so: This is a great book for actors that want to practice acting using exercises. I love this book. It's a must have for any actor."
5,Perfect gift,The DVD is on my boyfriend's opinion great inspiration and education to start creating damascus patterns. Thank you so much for issuing it. Knifemaker from the Czech republic :-)
3,You get what you pay for!!!!,"I received my necklace in a very timely manner. The concept was terrific and I love the look. The chain however is CHEAP and takes away from the necklace. It could never exact the original price but for the ""blow-out"" price; I can not complain."
1,Crappy,"YUCK...poor quality, bad chain will turn your neck green, poor workmanship on the pendant...oh and it's painted black...not even worth 1.00...don't buy"
1,A waste of time and money,"This book would be unpublishable anywhere other than India which thrives on this sort of nationalistic, one-sided nonsense. The English prose is almost unintelligible, there is little argument or analysis that is coherent, even allowing for the author's lack of proficiency in English. Don't waste your time with this crap"
3,Hold on on this product,"I get two of this product to wach TV. The two are intefering, hard to make them work at the same houshold. The other unexpcted problem, the charger. The sony battery run out before a longer movie finishes. It needs Sony specific battery, really can not use other batteries in the unit. The cahrger does not take any other than sony, - sony figured how notto take it. Very inconvinient. Sound qulity OK for a wireless. YOu can notice the difference with a ($80-)Sony wired headphone. The wired phones still better. You should not expect they are the same quity of sounds, that is OK."
2,Espresso Capsules,"We were looking for Caffitaly espresso capsules for a German Tschibo Espresso machine.Unfortunately, the capsules I received, even though they looked the same on the internet, were a little too small and just don't work.What do I do with the 95 capsules left?Anybody interested?Anya"
3,one vile level?,"if you think your buying a level with a plum vile , you will not like this level ,because it does not have one. one vile for level only"
4,Finally!,Great book. I finally have found this book after a long search on outdoor activities. Very interesting hints on what high rope exercise are and how to debrief them. I'm reading again and again finding alwais new sources of ispiration. Unfortunatly many photography are impossible to be understood.
1,Not quite what the blurb describes. . .,"This book was described as fun for kids and there was nothing about its text or layout that was age-appropriate for the range indicated. Maybe it would be a fun gag gift for accountants, but the math and the ""tricks and puzzles"" inside were overly complicated in both description and instruction. Also, the layout of the book was cheap and not in the least appealing visually, and the paper was cheap stock. I intended to give this book to a child who is extremely advanced in math and it was not even appropriate for him. I ended up giving it as a gag gift to the controller at the office holiday party. Definitely would not recommend this book for young people."
5,Exquisite Sutherland,A great performance by a once in a lifetime performer with amazing vocal resources. Viewer from SF stating Sutherland was past prime is incorrect. This was filmed in 1976 when she was very much in prime. Second Covent Garden Borgia was done in 80 but voice still immaculate.
3,Italian Opera no subtitles,"This is an opera in Italian. I couldn't understand a word of it. I was looking for a documentary/biography on Lucretia Borgia so I bought this video. While it is of great quality and would be appreciated by someone who understood Italian and appreciated opera, it is not my taste."
1,big oversight,"A very elegant watch, well built. I'm sure it'll last forever. However, it's got a huge design problem that renders it almost unusable - you cant see the hands to tell the time. Look at the photo again - this watch has white hands on a white face. No contrast! I have to turn on a bright light in the room and shine it on the watch so I can just make out the time. Come on, Heuer, I would expect more from one of the finest timepiece mfgs on the planet. Black outline hands would have quickly fixed this. But white on white? Bottom line: it's unusable, and is going back to seller for a black face (that uses the same white hands)"
4,Nice but did not work properly (dead battery?),"I liked this model a lot and when I got the package, it was not working at all. I figured it was a dead battery so I sent it back for a replacement. Unfortunately, Amazon did not end up replacing it and refunded me my money instead. It's OK. I will get the new F-1 next time."
1,most expensive bad tool I own,"the gun lasted only a few times before the cheap plastic screw on thing broke. if you don't use all the glue in a tube the first time you open it, the rest of the glue goes to waste because it hardens after that and takes forever to heat up. then when it finally does it drips out of the end wasting a bunch unless you use the cap which means you gotta screw it on and off every time so you have to wear gloves coz the gun is too hot. The glue holds when you can get the gun to work. the glue is good but the gun is bad. you'll be sorry you bought (I think). hope this helps. this has been my experience with it. others may have different experiences."
5,Wow I was impressed,"This is a great product for certain occations. I am a professional woodworker and never would have guessed at the strength this glue unit would have. I can see myself using it way beyond woodworking. When experimenting I found great strength in a simple but joint, which is the weekest joint there is. Now there is a small gap left sometimes where there might be a little to much glue, but that can be kept to a minimal. Im sure that this wont replace anywhere where gluing and clamping normally take place, but it will take over where ever a brad nailer might be used. Not having to fill the little holes when attaching molding is great."
3,Strangely Good....,... if rather wooden 1930s' B Movie about the team of the day. Bloke drops down dead in the middle of a football game and it gets called off. Wouldn't happen now would it?! But its a murder not a heart attack. Investigation ensues with a Scotland Yard detective more concerned with the 'ballet' he's is trying to put on with a load of big coppers. Dreadfull plot but good period shots - probably one for Arsenal fans who miss the old Highbury.
5,"Margaret Cho, you are amazing","I just loved this book. Be prepared to plunge into a world that is painful, honest, and completely raw. It took amazing courage to write a book like this. Now when I watch her comedy or see her in a show, I have so much more perspective on this incredible woman (and makes me wonder about the backstage stories of other actors). The writing isn't super smooth, but the frankness and very real experiences more than make up for it. Also, lots of humorous moments that will make you laugh out loud. You should definitely buy this book if 1) you are at all a fan of Margaret Cho 2) you are interested in a glimpse into the true Hollywood (includes a crazy look at her stages of getting, shooting, and losing her ABC sitcom) or 3) you want a fun, crazy read of a celebrity biography."
3,No joke!,"More than you ever wanted to know about Margaret's misguided escapades into drugs, booze, food, and sex. This book is a more brutal account of her life than she portrays in her stand-up routines; I don't think her intention is to make you laugh. Moreover, I found it annoying that she ""name-drops"" Madonna in a few places (one doesn't know if she's ever met or talked with the over-rated Material Girl, but for some reason she likes to mention her name!). Alas, one can see why Margaret would have such a liking for the notorious Boy Toy.Margaret reveals much in her book and gives many of life's lessons through all the mistakes she's made in her turbulent life. But then again, what comedian hasn't had a turbulent life?"
2,I'll pass.,"I am always interested in memoirs by famous people. Tracking their path to fame is usually enlightening and entertaining.I've found that books by comics are particularly difficult to read. So much of their entertainment value comes from non-verbal communications. This was true of Cho as well. The book felt flat to me, and it was disjointed, jumping from timeframe to timeframe with no particular rhyme or reason. While many of the anecdotes conveyed were interesting, I had trouble following along.As a result, I stopped about halfway through. It was just too confusing for me, though I value her story and experiences.For the light of heart -- you may want to avoid this book. It's quite graphic in parts and she doesn't hold back on the sex, drugs or rock-n-roll."
2,Not Enough Information,"I give it two stars because the writing is pretty good. But I didn't think it contained enough information. As a stand-up comedian myself, I like to know how I can maximize my chances of getting my big break like the author did. But no mention of that. It just seems suddenly she is this popular comedian that the whole neighborhood knows and that's it. For people who enjoy reading fiction, this book is for you. Some of the tales are just totally off the wall I question the credibility of the author. Well, I'm a non-fiction reader and basically there are two key points you should get from this book: 1) Know what you want in life, not what others want 2) Love yourself, because noone else will unless you do first."
4,Inspires through laughter and tears,"I have been a fan of Margaret Cho since I saw her on the ABC sitcom ""All American Girl"" when I was eight. Now, many years later, I have learned that times were not so pleasant on the set. Her book is told in such candid honesty, sometimes you can't believe she is sharing so much of her life with the reader. Due to this remarkable trait, you never stop and think if maybe she is sugarcoating the truth. The book works on so many layers, for it is heartbreaking at once (be prepared for Margaret's harsh camp 'retreat' early on in the book), and yet, she can reflect with such insight, that she can make almost any situation humorous. Her honesty shows that we are all flawed individuals and that if we keep at it, greatness awaits."
5,Incredible!,"For fans of Mary's Danish, this album is what we've been waiting for! Julie moves from rockers to ballads with an amazing amount of emotion and grace. It just doesn't get better than this!"
1,not all its cracked up to be,"From reading the reviews and hearing she's been compared to Carrie Akre of Goodness and the Rockfords, I expected Julie Ritter to be something pretty cool. I was very dissapointed however by the lack of anything good about this album. First of all, her voice seems inexperienced and lacking. Secondly, the music seems choppy and not well put together....almost like a VERY ametuer Veruca Salt type of thing, but worse. Dont expect this album to stir up anything in you except maybe a headache."
3,Sturdy but scratch easily,"Bought these dishes for my wife. She loved them initially, but after a few uses we started to notice gray scratches on the surface of bowls and plates. Over time the scratches have covered almost all of the dishes. On the positive side, they do take a beating well."
5,A New Understanding of Who We Are,"For those seeking a glmpse of what awaits us beyond finiteness, this book provides it. But for those seeking a deeper understanding of our nature and our relationship with others and the universe, this book demonstrates it. Follow along with Peter as he opens new doors and you will suddenly realize that you have changed as well."
2,"Great sound, poor QC. Two bad units.","First off, I'd like to say that when this unit was working, it sounded fantastic. However, the first one I received had bad analog inputs, and the inputs on the replacement went bad after very limited use, albeit over a period of three years. This may have had something to so with removing a mic with the phantom power on. If you have one--don't do that.I didn't particularly like the control layout, and the analog input controls were very non-linear. I could go from no signal to clipping in about an 1/8th of a crank. Also, it's very large. I would've thought that would make the unit more reliable in terms of thermals. Didn't help.That was all livable. What was not was two bad units with a total of 72 hours of run time on them. Bottom line. Buy at your own risk. Poor QC."
2,Not worth the money,I purchased the product less than a year ago. It was easy to setup and worked well until... it stopped working. I have no clue what's wrong with it.I've contacted their support team about a week ago and have not heard back yet.I would not recommend this product.
1,"Poor drivers, prone to instablity","The audio quality, in and out, is fine. Functionally the unit is nice, except the Vista drivers haven't been updated since they were released, and I am seeing DAW crashes at least once an hour with this thing (but not with others)."
2,Poor software makes any hardware useless.,"I came back to realize that I can't use my audio interface anymore. There is a huge lack of software support for this line at Creative. I could make it work 2 minutes and now it's not playing anything anymore, there is tons of complaining users in their forums: they do not care. I hate buying quality things to throw them in the garbage, especially when a multinational company is behind it and they call it a pro line. This unit never worked well anyway, having some weird glitches all the time and poor windows support. It may be good hardware, but But you can't use that thing without a computer, and now it's useless in any point. I strongly discourage buying Creative products from now on."
1,Poor Quality Coating,The rubberized coating started wearing off almost immediately. It looks like peeling skin after a sunburn - very unsightly.
1,this is crap..........,boring and not enuff skin.......a cheap lezy rip off.nikki nova is one of the hottist woman in the world and she made this crap whats up with that nikki.
4,Unique Music,"Hayling is the best track on this album and if you hear it you will purchase this album. Each song is so different from the last but in a good way. Highlight tracks are Hayling, Glitterball, Fear Of Guitars and Machine Says Yes. If you want cutting edge electronica purchase this album."
5,THE TROPICAL FISH MAGAZINE IS A VERY GOOD SOURCE OF FISHES I,"I CAN SAID THAT THE TROPICAL FISH MAGAZINE IS A VERY GOOD SOURCE OF AQUARIST INFORMATION BECAUSE THIS MAGAZINE: SOHW HOW TO FEED A FISH,WHERE TO BUY A AQUARIUM ACCESORIES IN THE CHEAPEST STORES, WHERE TO BUY FISHES IN THE AQUIARIUM MARKET, SPECIAL TIPS FROM OTHERS AQUARISTS,ETC. IN THE TROPICAL FISH HOBBYIST MAGAZINE I WRITED: ISSUE MAY 1986, PAGE 79,"" A BEGINNERS GUIDE TO SPAWNING ANGEL FISH"" THEN I AM THE LIVING PROFF. CAN I CONTINUE TO WRITE MORE ARTICLES? IN THIS MOMENT OF MY LIFE I CAN WRITE MUCH MORE ABOUT FISHES WITH PHOTOS: SPECIAL TIPS FOR BEGGINES, LIKE HOW TO REPRODUCE ARTEMIA SALINA TO NAUPILII- ADULT STAGE,HOW TO PEEL THE TINY EGGS TO REMOVE THE SHELL USING CLOROX, ETC, ETC.YOURS TRULY, HECTOR DUARTE FROM HERMOSILLO, SONORA, MÉXICO."
4,I read every issue cover to cover,"In past years, there were other good magazines in the hobby. During the last couple of years however, TFH has taken the crown as the best. I read every issue cover to cover.I receive two fish magazines, but if budget forced me to choose just one, this would be it."
4,"good product, slow shipping",took over 2 weeks to ship to hawaii. otherwise these speakers work as they should. had them installed this week and so far so good. 4 stars because they didnt respond to email right away and shipping was too slow.
2,Too Large and Clunky,"This map is one of those maps that you need to pull open and spread out. It's complete and of that sturdy material that doesn't rip, but if you are looking for something that you can pull in and out of your bag for a quick look where you are, this is not it. The Streetwise Map is excellent and much more convenient."
5,Excellent Introduction,"Esack's book is an excellent introduction for those who are beginners in Quranic studies as well as a great refresher for those more involved with Quranic studies. Esack is able to cover the main themes of the Quran as well as the historical and contemporary discussions relating to the Quran. It is also very well researched from an academic point of view as it uses both contemporary and traditional sources for Quranic commentary. Finally, this book is a great starting point for understanding the Quran."
1,DID NOT FIT,"It did not fit my bumper. It was advertised as a universal step bumper hitch, that sounds to me like it will fit any step bumper. What it actually will fit is the old ""flat on the bottom"" step bumpers like was on the 1980's trucks."
4,very good,A good historical novel not encumbered with inaccurate information. Not for those seeking Historical romance but decent military history about an era in time
4,A treasure for the open minded,"This book is a must for beginners. Ms. Gray's definitions make sense. The concepts if taught from the beginning, carry the dancer easily into the advanced levels. Those who do not like the book are struggling with their own closed minds not any shortcomings on Ms. Gray's part. If we all had learned tap with these unique concepts so many bad habits would not have to be ""re-learned."" I have taught tap for 19 years and all my students have adapted the curriculum provided in ""The Souls of Your Feet."" The historical descriptions and resource information have proven invaluable as well."
2,Extremely Confusing,"This book takes the simplest of tap steps and words it so strangely that it takes you 20 minutes to figure out that she's trying to say ""flap heel heel brush heel toe heel"". The index of terms are listed by number of sounds rather than alphabetically, so as your referring back to the index, which you must do often because her terminology is so different, it can be hard to find what your looking for. I feel certain, if a beginner picked up this book to learn a little more about the art of tap dance, they would most certainly become so frustrated, they'd probably decide to forget about tapping all together. I did, however, require my students to read this book for their college advanced tap class, because I do think that they should be exposed to different teaching styles. After reading it, they were asked to review it. It was definitely the least favorite book of the semester(They were required to read four books). Not one single student gave it a good review."
3,A word of caution...,"This book helped me a LOT, I have to admit to that. But experienced tap dancers beware: looking at words that describe steps can be extremely frustrating when you can't visually see them done. Acia has written some wonderful pearls of wisdom within this book, and I highly reccommend it to any serious tap dancer"
2,Maybe missing a key feature,I use a lot of aa rechargeable batteries and chargers. I am about 99% sure that this charger has no auto shut off feature. The batteries stay warm in it for days after they have completed charging suggesting that it is infinitely trickle charging. This is not good it can damage your batteries. I can't find any claims on Ultra's part that the charger does include an auto shutoff to prevent battery damage.
5,Battery Charger,"This is a fantastic battery charger. It couldn't be easier to use and it works. Just pop the batteries in and they charge. Each battery slot is individually controlled so you don't have to charge batteries in pairs or groups AND each battery doesn't get over charged. Also, once you put the batteries in it has a button to fully discharge before charging. The one downside is that the discharge button controls 4 slots, so you have to make sure that you want discharge all of the batteries that are in there. But it's a very minor issue because again each slot is individually controlled so if one battery finishes discharging it doesn't have to wait for the others to finish before it starts charging. Also, you could start the one that you want to discharge and then pop in the ones that you don't want to discharge after you've pushed the button.Anyways, I recommend this charger."
4,Good if You Don't Mind Waiting,"This charger is a great buy i am very satisfied but i can see why one would not like it: It is very slow it takes almost twice as long as other chargers, It can charge 8 battery's at once but it only comes with 4 (easy problem to fix). The good side is that it discharges before it charges extending the battery lifetime. It shows how close it is to full charge. Overall I think it is a good buy.One more note: It does have a bright light on it so can be annoying if you keep it in your bedroom"
4,Underrated,"I found this arc of Ayakashi to be most scary. The first arc tried to be everything and ended up doing everything blandly, while the third was some real eyecandy and had its moments, but didn't really get under my skin. This arc, however, is really terrible, in a good way.Live action and animation are combined in a way that screws with your mind a little and facts and fiction are toyed with in the same way. The narrator is as much a part of the story he tells as he is just a storyteller.I don't see too much animated horror that delivers, so if you're a horror, history, or drama fan, I don't see too much of a reason not to give this a chance, especially since right now, it's so reasonably priced."
2,As general as it gets,This product should not have the words 'Training Course' in it. It is misleading to the buyer. All that you get from this material is a general overview of what .net is about. It's basically just an advertisement for .net and the Eiffel language. Stay away and spend you hard earned money a good book instead.
2,"WEll for the right person, maybe","Unless you are a Latin scholar or a linquist, this is not the book for you, don't waste your time or money. I got a copy from the library and did not buy it."
2,Not as expected,These brushes did not last as long as expected and two of them fell apart. Wondering if we just received a bad lot or if they are not authentic.
1,Counterfeit product!!!!,"I couldn't figure out why the heads kept breaking off the brushes. I've had this happen 4 times in the past 6 months (1 brush at work, 1 brush at home). Then I decided that perhaps they were counterfeit, not knowing at the time about the thriving market for counterfeit Oral B brushes. Looking closely at the broken off brush head, two of the 4 long yellow things (flossers?) are also broken off.I will never buy brushes on Amazon again.They are much cheaper for a reason ..."
5,Excellent Product,This set is a great value. These are becoming harder to locate and the quality is excellent as well. Six in a set? I probably can't find them next time and will need a new unit. Grab these now and you won't be sorry.
4,Very good product but,"This is exactly what the product description stated but know that the heads are the floss heads...I did read it well enough and ordered them thinking it was just the plain heads. These have four rubber paddles on the head which is supposed to floss while you brush... it feels funny kind of like a beating in your mouth but they do floss for you, so I will keep then and be sure to read the description better next time"
5,I love these brushheads!,"Since I started using my electric toothbrush, I get rave reviews from my dentist how clean my teeth are. The pockets I had in my mouth have shrunk and are no longer a concern for the dentist. I recommend this brushhead with the flossaction on it."
5,Great Toothbrush Heads,These heads are wearing well (despite abuse from my 4 boys) and functioning as anticipated. They seem to be the real McCoy.
3,"theme from ""the Lovers"" song title: ?Love and Rainy Weather",I have searched High and Low for this song to no avail. Is there anyone who can help me find it in LP/CD/EP format? The film was called The Lovers or Lovers and starred Richard Beckinsale and Paula Wilcox? The song in question was the theme to the movie and went something like.....love and rainy weather are followed by the sun? Please please help me in my search for it!
4,Cadidate for goddess,This is one of many mangas i've read and enjoyed. But it's a bit of a cliffy. Ending with to be contined next volume.....? All in all i really enjoyed this manga. Clay finally faces facts is he really made for being a candidate? Things come to terms in this emotion packed volume will Zero get to say goodbye? And will this be the last time they meet? I don't know but i can't wait to find out in the next volume of candidate for goddess.
1,Will not run on windows 7,Will not run on windows 7 and I can not get it to run on standalone it only works on online which no longer exists
4,"All the Fun of Halo, but on a PC","I was disappointed when they dropped support for achievements on LIVE, but getting the PC version was a good second choice. Still get to play the game, get achievements, etc. Only downside is not being able to play the storyline co-op with a buddy."
4,Fun game,"Enjoyed playing this game, it's got a good story line that is engaging, with a good blend of challenge vs. accessibility."
2,Disappointment,"There was a lot of excitement about this game. I was excited too. Unfortunately the game is mostly a disappointment. I guess I thought because Vista was required that there might be something new in here. This is not the case. This is simply a port of the Xbox version. The graphics are years out of date and look pretty clunky. It is not DX10. The highly touted ""Game for Windows"" that was supposed to let us play with Xbox users does not. You can only play with PC users, and there aren't many of those. Maybe ""Games for Windows"" will be fixed in the future, but as it is now I find it very disappointing too.This whole experience has been a disappointment all the way around."
1,Halo 2,"With AMD dual processor 6000, 2 nvidia 640 mb video cards, 4 gb memory.The game will not run. Keep getting message ""Halo 2 has stopped working.""Can't find patch or help any where from Microsoft. Don't waste your money on this game"
4,Doesn't Work Anymore,Halo 2 is a great game. But since Games For Windows Live servers are offline. There is no way past the halo 2 menu without signing into Games For Windows Live which is offline so buying the game is a bad idea now cause it will not let you past the menu without signing in. Not even to let you play campaign or anything.
5,Good Game,The game came in and I had to call Tech because the key was aready used? But they gave me a new one and it works perfectly on my Windows 7.
2,Remember Vista only,"hmm i got this game for my birthday and as it said on the package ""windows vista only"" so i guess i'll return the game no problem but i think microsoft would have been wise to make versions for other computer types as well. and if you want a good pc 1st person shooter i'd highly recomend Halflife 2 or the orange box set which comes with three games halflife 2 episode 2, Portal, and teamfortress 2."
1,no co op,you can not play two player simultaneously that is the whole reason i bought the game. extremely disappointed
1,Doesn't work on Vista system,I received Halo 2 and wound not work on my Vista Home system..Tried to install it twice and gave up!!!
2,Bad graphics for big bucks1,Big disappointment!It is not worth $50.00 for lousy graphics.These graphics cannot even come close to FEAR(not designed for Vista!!!!)!No wonder why PS3 graphic quality is way better than Xbox360. I hope that they will not publish Halo3 for PC.
1,Should have read the reveiws...,"IF you are a pc gamer, and want to use and xbox controller to play this game. Your in luck you have no choice. As far as the game goes its choppy and now I find out I need to upgrade my vid-card. pffftt... I just bought a new vista pc. Bad enough I bought this game, and a x-box controller. But now buy a new video card to play games for windows, I THINK NOT."
2,Game demands too much!,"VISTA! OK that's not so bad but a WEI of 5? Thats just horrible. In order to have a WEI of 5 is crazy. Without that score, the game just doesn't want to play smoothly. Make sure you have a good graphics card and CPU to play this game. The games graphics aren't even that good. Why it demands so much makes me wonder..."
3,Halo 2 Game,"The game is good, but the fact I couldn't re-program the mouse controls disapointed me. I had to find an external program to do the control preferences."
1,INVALID CD KEY,"game is GREAT but watch out for the cd keys!!!! i got this game shrink wrapped from amazon with supposedly brand new key and the KEY WAS INVALID RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!!! had to jump thru hoops with microsoft till finally i reached someone who generated a new key for me. other than that remember to do a full install of the game THEN UNISTALL the gamesforwindowslive client which the game installs, download and install the latest gamesforwindowslive client from microsoft THEN launch the game and play."
4,"Overall, good.","Halo 2 looks much better on the PC than on the Xbox, but given that you have to be online to play even the campaign is definitely a bummer. As far as a game goes though, its a great buy to add to your collection."
1,"This is a horrific Windows port, stay away!","Disclaimer: I am rating this individual product, not the game itself. I loved it on the xbox!This is the most shoddy xbox to PC port I have ever played. It does not play properly at all on my PC. The entire game plays in matrix mode at about 0.5-7x scale time rather then at full speed and it is unplayable. It runs at a fairly low framerate on my i5, 4.4GHz quad core with a GTX570 and 8 gigs of DDR1600 ram. This is nothing like Gearbox's superb port of Halo: Combat Evolved to the PC, stay away unless you are just buying it for the included free month of xbox live!"
3,Windows live invalid product code,Invalid product code contact Microsoft tech support at ( 1-800-537-8324 ) for a new product code and tech support for the product has ended. So the tech support probably will not want to give you a new code. Not saying that they wont. They gave me a new code for my game but it took me several phone calls and 3 hrs to get it. The only people that can get you a new code are these people at ( 1-800-537-8324 ) they may say that the tech support for the product has ended ( which it has ) but they can somehow generate a new code.
4,Works now.,"Didn't work at first on my families computer, but fortunately my first own computer runs Vista, so everybody won, but mostly by chance."
4,Love it!,"Oldie but goodie -- game play is great. I'm half way through now and love it. You get to play as an elite for what I assume is half the game. That's different. I'm not sure if it's 'good' different or 'bad' different. But it's still hella fun.Installation is a hassle. I like to think I'm fairly tech-capable but like the other reviewers on here found the install near impossible. I even had to call technical support. You can install offline but it's not listed in the most obvious place. I also tried this on a Windows 7 machine and a Vista one. Didn't like the 7 machine. The Vista one was fine -- it just took a phone call to get it installed. Also, the start icon was NOT listed in Programs under the Start Menu, nor was a shortcut installed on my desktop. I had to do a search to find it buried in kind of an odd Microsoft Games something rather folder and launch from there.I'm sure I'll play more than once."
4,Halo 2 for Vista,"This is a great remake of the original Halo 2 for Xbox. It has better graphics, the ability to play online with an xbox silver membership, earn achievements, and the ability to customize your own maps. The only drawback to this game is its lag. Even if you computer meets or exceeds the minimum, it will lag at times. When people join the match in mid-game, it will lag during the connection process. I would recommend this game to any fps lover even with the cons.Halo 2"
3,Halo 2,"I loved the very first halo i sort of still prefer it. However halo 2 is pretty cool too. i like the new weapons and the enhanced details. i like the fact that you can be part of the covanent too. If you do have a lower to middle end computer you need to lower all the video details or the game is very slow. I have an HP dv6000 with a NVIDIA GeForce 7150M / nForce630M the graphics are really nice when set to optimal settings, but like i said it slows it down a lot I dont think i have strong enough processor."
4,January 7th 2013 on Windows 7... Works,"I read every review about this product i got mixed results. Like the Product key doesn't work, to the Message about having multiple live ids signed in then preventing you to play. I ordered this on January 3rd and arrived on the 7th, I opened it and put the game in entered the product key and... it Works, no problem, Installation finishes and I then go to play, this part is indeed true there is a popup about having multiple Live ids, then closes you out of the game before it begins. This can be delt with simply downloading the Windows Game thing to your computer and signing into your Windows live Id... that easy. I then continue to play... well, this part is also true you need a insanly good processor to run the game, not kidding it will lag badly even on the lowest resolution. This game does indeed work, im just trying to get the Game/FPS speed faster"
3,good,the game is really good but it slows the computer which i have over .... space on it the game is super slow but a good game
4,Perfect condition brand new as promised.,I assume whom ever wants to know about the game its self will go to YouTube and check it out. But I might as well say that this game is amazing. It's very fun and the campaign has difficulty levels for every person whether you just want to mess around or you really want a challenge. The product was brand new as promised so no problem there. Nice manual and it even had a Windows Live Games trial which I didn't try to see if it still works because I have one already. I can't wait to play it when my new computer comes. Hopefully I can avoid the Windows Live problems so many people are having with it.
2,IMPORTANT MUST READ!!!!,"IMPORTANT!!!THIS GAME IS ONLY FOR WINDOWS VISTA IF YOU DONT HAVE VISTA THEN DONT BUY IT!!!!!!dont make the same mistake i almost did!!!!otherwise if you do have it, its a pretty fun game!"
1,They should stop selling this game,"This game is essentially an expensive drink coaster. I bought this game in November of 2012 when I was stuck at my in-law's house with just my wife's Windows 7 laptop and needed a Halo fix. The installation process was fine but when I wanted to start the game it asked to input a Windows Live ID or create a new one. Unfortunately my existing ID didn't work and neither did a new one I created. After searching the internet for help, I discovered that not only does Microsoft no longer support the product, it may have even removed the ability to play at all because you're trapped on the start screen."
1,doesnt work on windows 7,"i just bought this and am very disappointed that it will not work on windows 7. I think they should add that in somewhere that it doesn't work on windows seven ,considering the majority of people have it., before someone wastes $13 on it.I hope a patch comes out soon for it but for now ill just trade it in i guess, considering i cant refund it since i already opened it and learned the hard way it doesnt work on windows 7."
3,"Worse than 1, but still OK","Well, where to begin...the story is short, i beat it in 2 days, the HUD is simplified for the console kiddies, the is no HEALTH, you have your shields then 4 or 5 hits then your dead, and the worst thing of all, online play is NOT FREE! The best thing about Halo 1 is that you could go online all the time and fight it out...but now with PAY multi player? Its sad to see this game sink so low...The graphics are alright at best, nothing to exciting...considering this is a game for windows VISTA i expected DirectX 10 but nope, its Dx9...i wish wal-mart had a return period on games if you weren't satisfied, I'd take it back in a heartbeat...AVOID THIS GAME! The two-prong storyline is good, but that can't make up for the downfalls..."
1,Halo 2 - Big disappointment,"Having played Tribes many years ago on an older PC, I was certain this on Vista would be at least as much fun. Not even close. Tiny maps, small variety of weapons, limited servers, This is a huge disappointment. Don't waste your money. Get America's Army for free or purchase Call of Duty instead."
1,Can't get it to work on Windows 7...,It's hard to rate the game when I cannot get it to work on Windows 7. I got it to install but got stuck at the update. Update couldn't connect so I did a manual update from the website. Now I'm back to square one with the initial error I received when first trying to install. Something about Windows Live...can't remember the exact wording. Ugh.
4,Halo 2 Vista,I am very happy with Halo2 Vista. Graphics are hardcore for PC and the mods on the internet have really boosted my experience with these kind of games. I would recommend to anyone who likes the Halo games.
5,One of my favorite PC games,Halo 2 is an epic sequel to Halo: Combat Evolved. The game play is great and the story is even better. I would definitely recommend this game for any gamer.
1,Invaild Product Key,"The game was installing fine until i tried to input the product key which worked at first but as soon as i run the game and try to login into my GFWL (i used my XBL account) account....it says ""invaild product key."" I have never been so disappointed in a product such as this one. Absolutely disgraceful for a game that i pay money for and it doesnt even work!!"
3,Amazing Game......Can't Play,"I bought this game with the inclination that it will work with Windows 7 because I've read and experienced it running on Windows 7. I installed it, went to run it, and nothing. Searched the internet for hours trying to find a fix. Nothing worked. Finally ran it in XP Compatibility mode and it said I had insufficient resources to run the game. This is of course, due to the fact that my computer has optimus. For those of you who don't know what Optimus is, it's an nVidia feature that allows for seamless switchable graphics. It detects when the dedicated card is needed and turns it on. Due to Halo 2 scanning your hardware before running, it only sees the integrated card and therefore will not run. So far I have found no fix for it and I am consoled only by the fact that I hope to build a desktop in the future. But if you have Optimus, do not buy this. It will not work. Only reason I gave the game the rating I did was because of how much fun it was on the original Xbox."
2,xbox quality on PC,"halo 2's graphics are comparable to unreal 2004 tournament. Disappointing for a game released in mid 2007. I expect 2007 games to have graphics comparable to rainbow six vegas or higher. Buildings look under textured. facial models have low polygon counts as well as textures are of low resolution. What do you expect from a game that was tailored to work on your 320x200 TV, with the highest of 800x600?Game physics are mediocre compared to PC game standards. Water does not splash when shot at. hand blade does not scratch walls like light sabers do in jedi knight 3.on another note, the game looks like it was rushed from the xbox straight to pc. The programmers were probably so lazy that they left all XYAB buttons from console controllers for pc players in game."
1,PRODUCT KEY INVALID,I bought this game brand new. I even had to umwrap it from its plastic. The product key didn't work at all. Its a huge let down.
2,Three years too late...,"The PC version of Halo 2 was released about 2 and a half years after the Xbox version and it shows. Halo 2 for the Xbox was a decent single player sequel but it was such a huge hit because of it's online play. Waiting almost 3 years to release a PC version caused Halo 2 to be outdated as soon as it was released.I almost couldn't even finish playing Halo 2. I couldn't get past the terrible graphics after playing other games that are older but were way better. Half Life 2 is a year old and F.E.A.R. is two years old and both are WAY better games graphically. I'm not even sure why M$/Bungie bothered making a PC version.If this game had been released 3 years ago when the Xbox version was released it would have been great. Instead, it was an outdated game even before it came out and it looks like M$ just released it to help push Vista. If you really love the Halo series just buy this used when it's about $10. That's about all this game is worth now."
5,"Great Game, Difficult OS","Halo 2 is of course lots of fun and, as yet, the newest Halo PC users have at this point (really Microsoft?). But its for Vista. Installing on Windows 7 was an interesting experience. It took some time, several restarts and reinstallations, and some internet searching.In the end, I think all I had to do was use the backwards compatibility settings along with turning off the internet connection on game startup. You can reconnect after the game is loaded. Its a little annoying but not especially a problem.So its worth buying but be aware it is not just plug and play."
2,Promotion for Vista,"This game was only released to promote Vista. Microsoft needs to get back to its roots, and gain customer's loyalty. Microsoft could of made the game much better if they only they tried. I would not recommend buying this game. The game (F.E.A.R.) has much better artificial intelligence with an overall better game engine. Please support the game companies that support gamers with high quality titles."
4,Lots of loading problems,"might just as well buy bioshock 2 with this, will save you a world of trouble getting it to play. First step is to get it loaded.. Install by copying the disk to your hard drive and run set up from there. put your errors on the internet to see what to do next.. and good luck. the maker of this game does not care at all about the customer and there websites will not help AT ALL.. It will work ,, but you will have to work for it. Need online for it. Good luck with it."
1,Don't buy if you plan on playing online or activating the game for the matter,"Don't buy this if you actually plan on playing online. Due to an update with how Games For Windows Live handles game activation, original GFWL games cannot be activated and therefor cannot be played online. After spending 3 hours on the phone with Microsoft support and being transferred over and over, I had my Product Key verified by them to be valid. The sad thing is not one of their employees knew anything update the problem with original GFWL game activations and there is no official response from Microsoft about the issue. I only found out about the problem after scouring the internet looking for a fix. Save yourself the hassle and just download it."
3,"Rest in peace, multiplayer.","I'm not sure why I'm posting this, since most likely anyone still going to buy Halo 2 wont care about reviews. But I just wanted to put the info out there that multiplayer is pretty dead in terms of players. There are plenty of servers, but even Halo *1* has more players. Halo 2 is still worth getting, just don't expect to play much PvP unless you can get a group of friends to play with you."
1,Halo 2 Ed's review,"Halo 2This s/w can only be used with Windows Vista and I do not have windows vista, I have Windows XP. Thus I waisted my money on a product I can not use."
3,Not worth installing Windows 7 for.,"Installed Windows 7 on a partition just for this game. Wasn't nearly as much fun as the original Halo. Got kinda bored with it early and even less impressed with Windows 7. Might be ok for rookies, but its obtuse for a power user."
2,Think before you PORT!,"Like most console ports, this game sucks. How can you even compare crappy console games like this to FEAR, Crysys, and Half-life?The graphics look like 1999, and the game play is much the same.People who play console game must have incredibly low expectations if this type of game can sell millions of copies."
1,Make sure you have the right system,"Unfortunately, my notebook couldn't play the game. It didn't have enough memory and didn't have the correct VGA card. Impossible to refund because the package was opened. So saving it until I have a better computer."
1,Of course it said requires Windows Vista in tiny letters,"Don't bother buying this unless you went for Microsofts scam for more money. I have Windows XP like normal people and as it turns out, I need to buy a whole nother system just to play it. I didn't so screw PC gaming, I'm back to the best console on the market, the 360 and the Wii is a bad console."
4,wicked!,"single player wasnt as good as combat evolved but it has its merits such now u can arm your comrades weapons to keep them alive and the single player also includes hidden skulls to find on the legendary difficultylimited activation sucks but they probaly are worried about pirating or game lending or over installationmultiplayer was fun and required team work and the acheivments are motivating to unlockthis is definetly a great pc game, no regrets:)but lack of cooperative campaign sucks:("
2,Only High End Computers,This game needs the best hardware to run fine withouth it slowing down...most people dont have computers design to run this game though the Requirements of the game dont look to high.
1,Terrible control,"this is an xbox game and not made for PC playing. The keyboard set up does not work more than half the time. I have tried to customize keys to play like Halo one and it fails to set the commands to the assigned keys. For instance; the screen tells me to hold the ""R"" key to switch weapons and when I do, it does nothing. I set the command to another key and it still says hold the ""R"" key.I have the mouse sensitivity set to insane fast and it is still annoyingly slow, even with a razor gaming mouse.After 1 hours of play and trying to work with the few commands that do work, I uninstalled the game and threw it in the trash. Total crap in the opinion of this heavily experienced FPS Gamer.System info:Pentium quad core 2.6SLI 2ea 1gig 450 gts GPUs4 gig dual channel ram"
3,Halo 2,"I was excited to play Halo 2 since I had enjoyed Halo so much but unfortunately the game did not offer that much. I did like being able to play as Covenant but I felt that the game was more like a movie and that my progression was just to get to a cliff hanger ending. Now I am left wondering when Halo 3 will come out for the PC if ever. The graphics seemed poor even though I had set the game for its highest settings. Don't get me wrong, the game was fun and if you are a Halo fan this is a must buy purchase but I felt that they could have done more."
4,bugged from hell,well the games graphics were superior as expected compared to xbox but it had no backwards compatability with xbox not even system link which is what i bought the game for
2,Buggy Game,"Haven't been thrilled with Halo 2. I spent a long time trying to get the game to work with XP. Their are patches to get the game to run in XP but at this poin it is not possible to play online. So I installed this game on my Windows 7 RC machine. After starting the game about 3 times and updating it each time i found the game feels a little shaky on my Hardware. (Intel Core 2 Quad 2.66ghz, ATI RadeonHD 4850 512MB, 4gb ddr2 RAM. I've discovered the online community seems small (smaller than the Original Halo online community) There seems to be no anti cheating system. and unless you enjoy fighting noobs in vehicles on blood gulch it probably won't provide a very pleasant online experience.The one redeeming quality of this game is the campaign. The story is great and except the cliff hanger ending was quite enjoyable.So overall my recommendation is to get Call of Duty 4 or don't pay over $15 for Halo 2 PC."
3,"Not my favorite, but...","Not sure if I reviewed Halo 1 here or not, but my only complaint is similar, that it is very repetitive. Wave after wave of baddies just gets annoying when you're not making any progress, just finishing out an over-inflated level. Maybe it's me... this just doesn't arouse the passion for me that the Half Life games do. The sequences where you are playing as the alien -- partially because of poor sound/voice acting, I spent a lot of those having little or no idea what I was trying to accomplish (""Arbiter, why whrer wuuhhh whhrrrr..."") I did kinda like the vehicle sequences, a lot more than the run n gun. I really got to hate the Flood, and I don't mean that in a good way. Really, more zombies?On a technical note, I ran this on W7, on a refurb eMachines box with no issues. Decent video, NVidia 8400 GS, 2G RAM, 2.8G Athlon. I think all the graphics settings were medium.So -- OK to while away a few hours . . . until Half Life 3 comes . . ."
5,damm best game ever,knowing that this game is old but this game istill rocks more online u shoul buy thi gamee is awesome
3,"Needs modern PC, but too late now","This game was probably pretty good back in 2004 when it first came out, but now in 2011, it's quite dated. While the graphics are crude, the game needs a surprisingly powerful computer to run. I have an nVidia 9800GT video card and it was working hard. As for gameplay, it's okay, but a bit repetitive. The storyline is interesting though and I found myself playing so I could get to the next cutscene and learn more. Buy the game if you're bored or want to continue where Halo:CE left off, but only if you can get it cheap (which you can easily).Word of caution: Halo 2 needs a Windows Live account to work, but apparently it was designed to work with Live 1.0. Today I think we're up to Live 3.0 and they aren't compatible. The first few times I tried to run this game, it had Live login problems, then suddenly Windows reached out and got the right patch all on its own and I was in business. (I have 64-bit Win7.)"
4,A good astronomy book.,Fairly up to date and a good text. Many good example problems to test your knowledge during the chapters. Sometimes a little dry especially during derivations.
4,Didn't set my heart racing,"Brull was certainly a composer of some skill, but very conservative, and not seemingly ready for the transition from romantic to late romantic form that took place during his career.The two concertos are very similar in form. A big theme in the opening movement is treated in a stately manner. A softer, but still stately, second movement follows. The final movement is more up-tempo, more lively but still somewhat constrained. While I consider the third movement of each concerto the best, Brull is always a bit too mannered for my taste. I never really had the sense he was enjoying his own music.The ""Andante and Allegro"" is pleasant, but not memorable.The performances and recorded sound are fine.I struggled between three and four stars. I went with four for skill, albeit not for heart."
3,An interesting history,"I'm not sure I can add too much more to J.T's excellent review. This musical is all about John Rait and his amazing vocal talent. This musical had a series of starts and stops with compsers and book writers before finally getting to Broadway. But the show was always built around Mr. Raitt, who was simply peerless in his vocalization."
5,Jean Matthews,"This Crosley phone is well worth the cost. Very easy to install. This replaced a country wall phone that was about 10 years old. I am very happy with the wood tone, ringer and connectivity."
1,"Two orders, two returns","I've ordered this phone twice as a gift for my parents, and I've had to return it twice. The first time for Christmas 2011, the phone was missing the handset. It finally became in stock again, so I ordered another one for them, and this time the numbers do not work. So you get a dial tone on the phone, but nothing happens when you hit the numbers. We've tried switching the pulse/tone buttons on the back, but it appears that the buttons just are not connected to the phone or something."
5,great mother's day present,"I ordered my camera for Mother's Day and I have used this camera more in 1 month than I did my other camera over 6 months. I love it and the zoom is great. I am still trying to learn all the settings; low light, action, etc. The movie feature is also awesome. The 1Gig card makes it very nice to hold large files of video. I would recommend this camera to anyone that loves taking pictures. Also, the camera is so light..........the picture and good look of the camera makes it seem like it will be heavy, but not at all."
5,Landmark recording,"As another reviewer mentioned, this 1980 recording was a landmark digital recording of a major orchestral work. But more than that, it was and still is an amazing interpretation of this often shortened and over performed work. Yes, Charles Munch and Pierre Monteux were masters of interpreting Ravel's work, but Dutoit and his forces took great advantage of the digital recording technology of the time, and brought out the diaphanous and intricate orchestration that is in the score. The playing is impeccable, and the rousing Pirate Dance is thrilling. Along with the other Ravel recordings that the Montreal Symphony did at that time (including the 2 piano concertos), any lover of Impressionistic music and Ravel should have these recordings."
4,Marvelously mysterious,"Enchanting, under-appreciated fantasia with a wonderful chorus implementation complimenting rapturous strings. Sounds well recorded, and spaciously arranged enough to accompany this kind of mystique."
4,"Lazy afternoon read, touching and somehow familiar","Bought this book because it was on sale, a stab in the dark, and very much enjoyed it. Readers of Irish heritage will especially enjoy the wonderful characters. The story is told from varying points of view which keeps it interesting--read it all in one day. Very memorable people, these Malloys from Troy."
4,Don't be so serious!,"I have every recording Elton ever made. Some in vinyl, some CD, some both. I've seen him in concert 4 times, in 4 different decades! I've been looking for this in CD because it's FUN! It's not serious. Anybody remember ""Theme from a Non existant TV series"" on ""Blue Moves"" (which I believe to be one of Elton's best)? It's a musical joke! Of course this isn't Elton's best work, and I don't think it was intended to be. But it's a great CD to put on to clean the house, exercise etc. I HATE Disco, but I loved this CD, because I felt that the whole point of it was Elton saying how much HE hated Disco! Loosen up folks, have some fun!"
1,Elton's all time worst,"When a superstar like Elton John records an album this bad, it practically threatens to negate all previous glory. Do not waste you money on this...."
1,The worst Elton John album,"Elton didn't write any music for this album. I don't even think he plays piano on it. His voice is just dubbed over the worst disco music ever made. Bernie Taupin did not write any of the laughable lyrics included on this album. Buy this only if you're a devoted EJ collector. Otherwise, get Tumbleweed Connection and Madman Across The Water."
2,Pete Bellotte is Giorgio Moroder right arm man,"Granted this album is not a classic by any standards but really Are you kidding Pete Bellotte is a quintessential figure of the disco era, he help produce some Donna Summers biggest hits in the information age we live in it doesn't take much effort to know or learn this. As for the music I've heard worse. A commercial flop doesn't mean necessarily mean the music is horrible."
1,A real masterpiece! A must-own for any collection!,"Ya know, people slagged the Stones and Rod Stewart for making disco records, but at least they had the decency to write their own songs! The same guy (Pete Bellotte) wrote and produced every song on this album (except the massacred ""Johnny B. Goode""). Maybe that's why they all sound the same, and feature the same cheesy keyboard and drums...Perhaps there's a story behind this. Maybe Elton was trying to get out of his contract or something, I don't know. Regardless, the album is a hopeless mess of uninspired disco, and the fact that it remains in print today is quite alarming."
1,Marginally better than Hanson ('nuff said),"This album is only for the absolute die hard Elton collector who has to have everything he puts out. I thought this would be the one album to never be released on CD but I was wrong. The only thing I really liked was the disco version of ""Johnny B. Goode"". Michael McDonald sang on this album, and Toto's Steve Lukather played guitar on it.. but do them a favor.. don't remind them!!!!! This CD makes a good coaster or frisbee."
2,why elton why?,if elton john wanted to piss off any of his beloved fans this album could do it.there is nothing here to even talk about its disco at its worst possible form.i think this was one of those contractually obligation type of things.either that or a last ditch effort to try to have a top 40 hit.
4,It was Disco ELTON!!,"I was in High School when this album came out. It happens to be one of my favorates. I am a EltonFanAtic, but this CD may or maynot be for your average Elton fan.**skyman of california**"
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...this probably wins the prize amnong fans and critics as the low point of Elton's career, but the proper disco production makes it a decent disco project, it just doesn't fit Elton. Nevertheless, it is fun to listen to his discoed version of Johnny B. Goode."
4,Try a different taste from E. John!,"Elton and disco.... This album gives you a special experience with its non-stop disco mood. In particular, the tune and the arrangement of instruments as well as the sound quality are excellent. Best tracks are ""Jonny B. Goode"" and ""Victim of Love"" Often I feel good with this CD trying to dance.... If you notice the cool price, you could try this easily."
2,Lighten up!,"I really doubt if this was made to be taken so seriously folks, every artist has had their low periods and after being so hot in the early to mid seventies, a fall was bound to take place! I agree it was certainly NOT even close to his former albums, but give the guy a break, he came back strong in the eighties didn't he?? I liked Johnny B Goode on the album, not much else but heck, play it an enjoy it for the fun it was supposed to be, if not, throw your copy away!"
1,What????????????,"I am flabbergasted at some of the reviews of this album. Folks this album is not just the worst album of Elton John's career, it almost single-handedly destroyed his career and any music credibility he had. To this day it has tarnished what was otherwise an impressive catalog from the 1970's.Avoid this album people. Avoid at all costs. Do not even frequent stores that keep it in stock, and sever friendships with anyone who owns it. It is an album like this that makes one question humanity."
1,Yep - this is the absolute worst thing Elton ever recorded!,"I just ripped this CD onto my computer using Real Jukebox. After I did, and played a few tracks for the first time in years, I was sorely tempted to just erase the files, even though I have 15 Gig left on my drive. Yes, the album is that bad. The only reason I'm holding onto this CD is in the hope it goes out of print - then I can sell it for $... on eBay. Meanwhile, it makes a great toy for my 1-1/2 year old. And who the hell is this Pete Bellotte that wrote the ... on this CD? I sure hope it wasn't a pen name for Elton John. I like early 80's Elton more than his other phases - The Fox, 21 at 33, Too Low For Zero are all great in my book. If you like those, stay far, far away from this one."
5,Mom in Ohio,I bought these for my son for Christmas. Looks like a great package deal for a great price and lots of fun for my son.
2,Try Successful Human Relations by William J. Reilly instead,I was disappointed--this was a combination of buzzwords and common sense. I found a different old book significantly more relevant and helpful; Successful Human Relations by William J. Reilly.
4,"Great ""Beginners Guide""--Well Worth It.","As a 20 year veteran business consultant I strongly recommend this one because it presents the ""meat and potatoes"" of leadership. I personally am tired of all the ""fad"" books out there trying to put a spin on leadership when what is important are the essential skills of leadership. This book captures those skills and is great for a new leader.Mick HagerAuthor of MONKEY BUSINESS, 7 Laws of the Jungle for Becoming the Best of the Bunch! A Short Tale of a Company That Gets It!Gibbs Smith Publisher, March 2007"
3,Took awhile to get it..,"Even email gotten from here stipulated that it would have taken up to 2 weeks or more, I think it is ridiculous that it did take a while to come. It's 2010, it shouldn't be like that. That makes people not want to buy stuff. That's why I only buy once in a while and only if other people want me to buy stuff for them; which what this book was for."
3,Disappointing... it is a simple rehash,"Having twice completed the original ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"", I found 75% of this is a rehash. The other 25% was mostly modern anecdotes that support the original author's theories. I found little original material."
3,You'd better off reading How to Win Friends and Infl. People,"The Leader in You just takes the issues pointed out at How to Win Friends and Influence People and gives more updated examples related to the business world.I really doens't add much value if you have read How to Win Friends... which, by the way, is much more fun and is better written."
5,Another QB classic,"My favorite track is ""In the long run"". But lissen! How could I pick a fav from these songs? I can't! Cuz every track is bangin. For real! It's a lassic! The Mobb is on point! Real hip hop!"
3,Average,"I would say this cd deserves 3.5 stars. I wouldn't even feel too bad about giving it 4. But it got 3 because it really dissapointed me. I thought it would be a lot better than it is. I would agree with some of the other reviews that said that it covers the same overplayed topics as many other rap cd's: guns, women, crime, etc. There is definitely nothing groundbreaking about this cd.At least tupac had a wider variety of song topics and incorporated different themes on songs such as Blasphemy, Hail Mary, Death Around the Corner. One could relate more to Tupac's albums because he often shares his internal struggles to do something with his life."
1,Pure trash...,"If you love true hip-hop then skip mobb deep's "" hell on earth"" and insted listing to wutang's 36 chambers, any album by rasskass, xizbit at the speed of life ( or any of his other albums for that matter) , any album by 2pac because he was a genious and any underground rapper. Mobb sleep is garbage and again their flow is pathetic so do not waste your money on this piece of sh*t album. Mobb sleep are nuthin but 4 ft lil b*tches."
5,Music for Hell,"This album is the darkest album, and is the best album Mobb Deep has done. Every track is dark as hell, there is no filler or pop tracks at all. This is the perfect album to put on if you angry and to play mad loud. Every track is hot, but the stand outs include Drop a Gem on em, Animal Instinct, Blood Sport, Extortion and GOD pIII. The Infamous cd was hot, but they take it to another level on this cd, there is absolutely no whack tracks."
2,Disappointing,"Ellroy writes quick and short. Short sentences, short words. 700 pages of short sentences, short words. Read a 700 page outline. You'll get the idea. I got bored. I got frustrated. I skipped pages. Wooden characters. Lots of n-word. Lots of Klan killing, krusading, and konspiracies. All the konspiracies of the 60s wrapped up in one big novel. Jedger Hoover likes rabbit code names. Keep a notebook to keep your rabbits straight. Only the kharacter of Jedger Hoover comes through krystal klear like the voice of Satan. Brilliant. Worth the read for only that."
1,Shame,"Who to blame? No, I don't mean for the JFK hit. That Ellroy recycles the conspiracy-theory plot for TCST is not the problem. Rather, who let him get away with publishing this DRECK. Did somebody convince him that he is an artiste and could get away with self-indulgent stylistic experiment? ... I'm going to burn my (hardcover!) copy and forget I ever read it. If you haven't read Ellroy, read any of the other books; you won't be disappointed. But forget TCST."
5,"More of the same - Ellroy is a bad, bad man.","If you've read any of Ellroy's books, you've read this one. It's a re-hashing of his language, character types, and tone. However, it's not a problem, given Ellroy's fantastic language, well textured character types, and darker than dark tone. Ellroy's knack for creating sympathetic monsters is at its peak. He gets your blood pumping and your synapses firing. In Ellroy's 1960's, no one is pure, everyone has a file, and broken knuckles get you places.As much as I would have liked to see Ellroy forge new territory, you can't beat a tried and true format. Worth reading, though not for the squeamish."
3,Not his best.,"After having devoured Ellroy's LA Quartet and American Tabloid, I was really looking forward to this next installment. The style in which it is written, however, proved to be a major obstacle in the enjoyment of this book. Ellroy chose to write in a kind of staccato style that was extremely annoying to me. ""He did this. He did that. He said this. He said that."" The whole book seemed to be written in sentences of about 5 words. Not his best effort"
4,"I enjoyed it, but not as much as American Tabloid","I am not going to even begin to try and recap this book, because it is best the reader goes into in unaware and others have done a thorough job. I will say that as good as this book is, and it is very good, and as good as Ellroy is, and he is very good, this book fell short of my expectations.I rather like his style of writing, but one thing bothered me. this may sound trivial, but after a while it is down right annoying: everyone released bodily fluids or threatened too every time they got scared, and they got scared way too often. Even the really hardcore, stone cold killers we have met before, they are always relieving themselves into their pants. why? Why are they shocked by every little thing, when this is the business they have chosen.That too me diminished the quality of the book, the author, the story and the characters.The plot was a little trite and I am bothered by the ending, but overall this was a satisfactory read."
4,This Book Vibes Great,"Ellroy wrote. Ellroy whooped. He gave us The Cold Six Thousand. Said Thousand was tres big. Said Thousand was epic. Said Thousand was violent. The characters are dark. The characters are unsympathic. Ellroy is a geunis. Ellroy write 670 pages in a short hand style. Said style got old. Marc whooped. He rebel yelled. He picked up his copy of L.A Confidential. Marc started reading.Great book, but the style was really hard to read."
2,Writing is even more hard to follow,To those who read American Tabloid be prepared that the machine gun style writing continues but its pace increasese..the plot was great but I could only read this in doses because the writing style got to me after awhile..too bad because this is one book i would have loved to sit doewn and read for hours instead of in 1/2 hour periods.
2,Overkill,The Cold Six Thousand is so overstylized that the plot is almost impossible to track. Ellroy is trying too hard to be literary.
5,Well worth the wait.,"After reading American Tabloid I became an instant Ellroy fan. I've read the L.A. Quartet and others but Tabloid has always been my favorite. I've been waiting for The Cold Six Thousand for the better part of a year. Although Ellroy's prose is MUCH tighter in his latest novel, it fits very well and makes the story flow a lot better. Let's hope we don't have to wait another five years for part three. I recommend this book to anyone."
2,There won't be a third.....,"If Ellroy does not make things better, we'll not como to read the alented third part of this trilogy...This book is even larger than AMERICAN TABLOID, without half that one's charisma and pacing. It's an endless procession of characters and short sentences (I'm being kind in saying ""short""...). I also had enough of bad guys like Littell and Bondurant always getting away with it all.It seems Ellroy is exorcizing himself and saying to everybody: ""everybody is corrupt, nobody is good"".Enough. AMERICAN TABLOID was enough for me."
1,A painful read,"Apparently Mr. Ellroy never graduate elementary school because he hasn't learned writing skills beyond the style of ""See Spot. See spot run."" This excruciating and exhausting novel is written entirely in fragmented sentences that force the reader to fill in all the gaps. It is without comparison the worst novel I have ever read. He never develops any characters or even attempts to build an interesting story for the reader, instead forcing them to constantly work to put all the pieces together. It is beyond my imagination why he has written as many books as he has. This is my first, and last, Ellroy novel."
1,"Good plot, but the style was annoying as hell","I can't believe I stuck with this book until I finished it. The prose style was soooo contrived and forced, it took everything I had to finish it. Hated it!"
2,A Disappointment,"This book was my first look at Ellroy's works. I am so glad I tried another one, after I read this, that showed me a better side of the author. Not one charactar in this book had any redeeming qualities and some of them were just plain boring to read about. The setting in the 60's was interesting. The poignant portrayal of J. Edgar Hoover was the best part of the book. I saw Ellroy on The O'Reilly Factor so I gave the book a try. It was a disappointment. For a better look at Ellroy's exceptional writing talents try the Big Nowhere, Black Dahlia, or LA Confidential. Unless the Kennedy, King assasinations and conspiracies interest you, pass this one up."
2,Literary Experiment Gone Horribly Wrong,"Ellroy writes short sentences. Ellroy writes many short sentences. Ellroy writes short, declarative sentences over and over. Ellroy's style starts out annoying. Ellroy's style becomes unbearable. Ellroy's book is a an experiment gone wrong."
3,Good,"No one would deny that this long novel about 100 people and their 1,000 crimes is a commitment. Really bad men are working hard on every page to bend the honest world to their greedy, bloodthirsty liking. Sort of a crash course of all things seedy in the sixties and early seventies. Ellroy's distinctive style will probably either make or break the book, depending on your preferences for how you want a story told. At times it seemed like a crutch, but for the most part I came to see form and function as one."
2,Out Stones Oliver,"""American Tabloid"" was edgy, dark and different. This is edgy and dark, but not so different any more. And it's long, really long. Extreme paranoia can get tiring and this does. I will still wait for the next piece from a very talented writer."
2,I don't know that I will finish it...,"I picked up this book for several reasons: its length, the fame of its author, the blurb on the back. And it is the feeling that I am missing something that is compelling me onwards. But I find the stacato sound of his writing to be very offputting. If I were to write the review as he write his novel, it would be thus:Porter didn't think the book was good. Porter regretted picking it up. Porter won't finish. Life is too short, Porter thought.So, if you like the spray of bullets that are his words, then go for it. Otherwise, pick up something smoother. On Green Dolphin Street is a good option."
2,Hip Hopped Up,"Let's start at the beginning; this is like reading EE Cummings on speed; it's smart, hip and all together way too cool for it's own good. I defy any reader to tell me what's going on at the conclusion of any paragraph. It takes three to four reads and a note pad to figure it out and Ellroy comes across as smirking and jiving at the reader like a kid with a riddle. I love the author and his previous work and grabbed this the day of release. But I tossed it after 50 pages and went on to something else. Far too dense and obtuse for most any reader. Sorry."
5,Book on Tape Cassette,Quick delivery; have no comment on tape quality because I have yet to listen to the book.
2,I am sad to say this book is boring,"I am a HUGE Ellroy fan. Seen him read many times, and have read everything that he's ever written, most of them I've read twice. I paid extra to have this book rushed to me, and I am so disappointed. His rapid fire prose has been cut to such ridiculous levels that it's not enjoyable. A typical sentence ""Pete flipped on the light. Pete grabbed the door. Pete swung it open. Pete walked out."" That sucks!, and it's irritating to read. I love Ellroy's writing style, but this entire story feels ""phoned in"". The characters are deflated: the new characters seem to be given almost no personality, and the story inches along rather slowly.I was looking forward to reading until 4 am, his books are impossible to put down, but this one was so boring that I actually took down American Tabloid and started re-reading that."
4,Addictive once started.,"I wasn't prepared for the style of writing here, short two and three word sentences, lots of short statements about what was going on, without a lot of extra description or extended dialogue. I almost put it down for good after the first few pages, but I was pleasantly surprised with how good and entertaining it turned out to be.This was the first by this author, so I guess I should have started elsewhere, but I felt the work stood alone without a problem.There is plenty of violence and rough language in this book, but it shows a side of the sixties that probably existed for many just as depicted. It is interesting to juxtapose race relations and mob activity in the sixties with how it is today.I definitely recommend this to those that like historically set crime fiction, with lots of action, violence and depravity. I'll be looking for more by this author myself."
5,a w e s o m e,"This single is really great, and not experimental, I think. Shakermaker is not such a great song, but Alive is amazingly great, the same as Bring it on down. D'yer wanna be a spaceman? is a calm song about life and dreams and failing, but it's awesome as well. In my opinion, this is one of Oasis's best singles."
5,A very experimental single,"The songs of this single are good, but not as good as other b-sides that oasis has. This single is for someone that likes nice, calm oasis songs, because the songs go very slow, but its an enjoyable single which you can listen to relax."
1,This is a scam,"I bought this book thinking it would have helpful pointers with women, but this 'complete guide' is nothing but a bunch of fluff. 16 pages into this book i come across a sentence that should have been on the BACK of the book. It says, this guide assumes that you have read our other two books, blah, and blah. At the start of every chapter they shamelessly plug thier other books, ""in our last book, blah, we taught you how to blah, now continuing on from that point..."" Do not buy this book, it is very misleading and has little helpful information in it."
1,The nice guys guide to NOT getting girls,"If there was an option for 0 stars, this book would definitely deserve it. The two fellows who wrote this book are scammers. Please do not buy this book unless you want to waste your money. If you use any concept from here, you will make every girl run for the hills because there will be no attraction."
1,To men who want to become their women's doormats,I've read a lot of books about dating.I rarely give one star to a book. But this one deserved my coveted special award.TWO THUMBS DOWN!
4,Wow!,"This was one of the best books I've ever read. As soon as they started quoting women, I starting asking women I knew if these theories could be true. Very much a page turner."
2,I had high hopes...,"From the description of the band and it's music. And there's a lot of potential there.But this album is a muddy mess. Every instrument is being played at every moment, and all are set at the exact same volume."
3,No Original Pac-Man?,Although this was a great collection of Pac-Man remakes. I'm dissapointed that none of the arcade originals from the Pac-Man franchise wasn't included. For the arcade originals look for Microsoft's Return of Arcade Anniversary Edition which has Pac-Man & Ms. Pac-Man. But the remakes included in this collection are great updates.Pac-Man: Adventures in Time is an adventure game where Pac-Man sets out to find 4 pieces of power pills. There are over 45 mazes. Each maze has it's own time peroid theme. It's a good 3-D update & the best one in the package.Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the Golden Maze was sort of another 3-D update but there was way lesser levels & the game could be completed in less than an hour. The game was a rush job.Pac-Man All Stars: Gameplay resembles nothing of the original Pac-games. The Pac-family members race around to see who can eat the most power pellets in open environments.
3,Not a serious radio - just a nostalgic toy,"I just bought this, it's a miniature - not as big as you would think (about the size of a large hardcover Harry Potter book). If you read reviews on the Web, a lot of people complained the sound is crappy, but it's probably how a 1930 Crosley would sound (which this is a replica of), so if you listen to old time radio and the right kind of music coming through the speakers, it's quite cool. It's made in China. You cannot open it to fix it (it has user warnings). Crosley's replicas have a high failure rate, so buyer beware (try to get it on super discount)."
5,Running the Himalayas,"I read this book some ten years ago. I still remember the two British brothers who ran along the Himalaya from East to West in 100 days. One of the best adventure books that I have ever read. Recently, I saw the book in a Kathmandu bookstore (Pilgrims). I wish I bought it then. ..."
4,liked it a lot. liked the standards.,"It is difficult to review with such a short listening time, however, i know i like it. great artists and great standards."
5,Great punk rock record,"If you are a fan of punk rock, especially the Blink 182 style songs then this record is for you. You can even download these tracks for free from the bands website, but only if you promise them to buy the single afterwards! So be a good guy and do both!"
5,"REAL COUNTRY, NOT MAKESHIFT BUBBLEGUM LIKE TODAY!!","This was Marsha's debut and what a debut it was. Produced by the incomparable Owen Bradley, every cut is a gem! Thornton pleases in every way and its such a shame that country music (if you can call it that today) doesn't recognize this style. This is beautiful music, reminiscent of Patsy, Loretta, and Kitty and produced by the man who produced all of them. This is a timeless offering from a young lady who unfortunately was in the right place at the wrong time. Nevertheless, this CD stands as a testament to Real Country Music, not the makeshift bubblegum of Martina, Reba, Faith, Trisha or Shania today!!"
4,A little odd...but fun,"This book ranges from the silly to the odd. It all depends on how comfortable you (or your kids) are with kid fears. It gets a little gross at times, but if you are comfortable with it, it can be fun. I know 3 boys (ages 3-5) who really enjoyed the ick factor of this book. It is also a really good springboard for discussions about making choices, especially for kids who see things in black and white. There are a lot of grey areas here."
5,You Can't Help But Love Michael Bolton's Love Songs !!,"The 14 gems featured in the re-release provide an awesome collection of the superstar's hits. These include: When A Man Loves A Woman, How Am I Supposed to Live Without You, and In The Arms Of Love. The CD makes for great listening and reminiscing. Michael's greatness shines in these all-time favorites, and this collection is sure to please. Add it to your collection."
2,He's lucky to be alive,"I'm surprised we haven't lost mb to a brain aneurysm by now. He can carry a tune, but I pull muscles myself just hearing him force those notes out of his vein-popping head."
1,Just what we needed!,"Another compilation of this guy's songs, could life get any sweeter!!? The last true crusader of adult contemporary schlock has bestowed upon us another aural jewel sent straight from the heavens. If you don't own a MB album the you do not know what it is like to live and I am ashamed of you. Get on your knees and pray to this princely man!"
4,"Great book, clumsy translation","The author's learning, decency, and humanity are obvious, and the story she tells is fascinating (and horrible). (One also should mention her courage.)Sadly, the translation appears to be the work of someone whose grasp of English idiom is flawed in the extreme. The reader is constantly having to translate the text into English from ""English."" It's like trying to bicycle on a mountain road covered with big cobbles and the occasional pile of boulders."
4,Those 1-star reviews,"The one-star reviews make it sound like the author has a strong pre-existing bias against Islam, and so is not treating Islam fairly in her book. Why do they seem to have that opinion? Do they have direct and accurate knowledge about the realities of Islam, and so will be able to prove Bat Ye'or is biased? No, never. Not now, and not anytime in the future. The honest reality of Islam is that it is a brutal thing that crushes the human spirit at every turn, unless that spirit is slavishly devoted to Islam. All normal human freedoms, even the healthy ones, are stifled by Islam. Many people do not want to believe that this is true, that Islam could be negative, because of the groupthink of their peers who will not accept that something this big is also evil."
2,An early solo CD,The songs on this CD are from 1979. Moast of them are faster. I'm not into Oldies so I can't say if the songs are good or bad. I only like Git down(Guitar groupie) and Love & pain.
3,The POWER of Cher,"A bit disappoining for a Cher album, but nevertheless Cher's voice shines through in all the great tracks from her long career. I would reccommend to any Cher fan. But this album fails to include the great songs from Cher's career."
2,Beware...,"If you are purchasing this CD for the album version of the 1963 hit ""Call Me,"" you're likely to be disappointed. While ""Call Me' is on the CD, it is an entirely different song. One I never heard of. Since I purchased this CD solely for this song, my rating reflects my disappointment. However, if you're a Bobby Bland fan you'll will enjoy this CD."
2,disappointing,"I am disappointed in this product. I have now tried this twice, thinking that perhaps the first hanging bag was punctured or damaged in some way. However, on the second try, it initially vacuum sealed but wouldn't hold the seal. So I'm off to return it again. The other bags are fabulous and I love them! Sorry I can't say the same for the hanging bags."
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,"I had read The Witch of Blackbird Pond and loved it,but I liked Calico Captive even more.I'm interested in the time period (late 1700s)and the storyline was great!"
2,Boys and Fashion Take Precedence Over Being Rescued,"While the plot followed the typical ""girl gets captured by Indians"" story line, the characters didn't. The main character, Miriam Willard, was more concerned with boys and fashion then she was with being rescued. Due to her conceited mind, Miriam, blamed the other captives, mainly her family, for letting her get captured. Throughout the book, she whines about being torn away from the love of her life, who she had just met recently. Even when she is being held prisoner at a French fort in Canada, Miriam was longing to be dressed in fancy clothes and have men notice her. Then at the end of book, when she finally gets what she wants, she gives it up to go back to a man that she has not seen for a long time. Her sister Susanna was the only reasonable character, who comprehended their situation. If it were not for her, the family would not have made it."
3,Ok but not my favorite,"I was a huge fan of ""witch of blackbird pond"" so I decided to read this book, too. I was a little disappointed because I am an American history nerd and this one was all about Montreal. The book was well written but as a mom, the story was a little too heartbreaking for me to bear and even harder to know the book was based on a true story. If you don't mind the French setting and you liked her other book, you'll probably like this one, too. But if you prefer American themed novels, pick up something by Ann Rinaldi."
5,Coming-of-age classic,"I read this book 25 years ago, and my daughter just finished it. Teenage selfishness and bravado give way to maturity, loyalty, and strong sense of self. A wonderful book."
2,Not a bad looking watch. But Invicta are a cheaply built product.,I just purchased 2 Invicta watches & a Pin Remover from Amazon. I had to shorten the band & one pin bent as I used the tool. I would not reccommend these watches if you are looking for a good quality watch. I should have purchased a Seiko or Tag Huer.
4,No short-cuts makes for WUNNERFUL desserts!,"Since my gluten-free regimen began after diagnosis for ""intolerance""; I've sought nutritional direction and assistance with finding a new path for cooking. However, baking has never been high on my list of favorites, mostly because my own consumption of wheat flour-based desserts was never enjoyable and their creation just as unsatisfying. In this book, the ingredients, steps, methods and results are all TOP NOTCH. Great attention and just-enough explanation has helped me create very delectable cakes and pies that I would have never bothered attempting before. As with most recipe books, the paperback version is void of helpful photos. However, it has given my family and friends another glance into the challenges of eating gluten-free; it's great for sharing recipes with those who'd cook for those with intolerances/allergies."
5,LOVE IT!,"I admit it... I have a cookbook addiction! And since our family has been gluten free, I have added quite the collection of gluten free cookbooks to my shelves. And I use them ALL! Well, I now have a new favorite for gluten free desserts... CONNIE SARROS' DESSERT COOKBOOK! EVERY recipe I've tried is fantastic! And if you can crave it, Connie has a recipe for it! I can't say enough about it! I highly recommend it to ANYONE who wants to venture into gluten free baking, or just add new options to the dessert menu. But warning: everyone will start asking you to bring the dessert... everytime!"
5,Smells great and does a great job!,"This is a huge bottle! The pump makes it convenient to get the product out. The first thing I noticed was the smell....wow! Yummy!! The first time I used it, I was not disappointed. It's a thick conditioner, spreads well, smells great and leaves my hair very soft. I've used it for about 3 months now. No complaints."
4,conditioner,"This works pretty well. Not heavy, but not quite enough to calm the frizzies, either. I'm going to use this bottle and maybe try something else."
4,catwalk oatmeal and honey conditioner,"I love this conditioner as well as the shampoo. I have used it forever and people always ask me what I use because my hair is so shiny and healthy. I was sorry to read it had parabeens (builds up in breast tissue and may be one of the causes of breast cancer) in it and wonder if this is why it is no longer made--I can still buy it in Oregon at a few stores, but now I am afraid to. I wonder if there is a substitute."
2,Not awesome.,"I have been searching for a good, honey-based conditioner since The Body Shop stopped making theirs. I tried this, and my hair feels worse than when I was using cheap-o Suave. Maybe the oatmeal's not great for naturally frizzy hair, because my hair is now poofier than ever. To be fair, it does smell good. The search continues..."
3,"Great smell, doesn't quite work well","This smells amazing, but as soon as I rinse it out my hair feels really dry and I usually have to spray in a leave-in conditioner afterward."
5,Love it,"I cowash with this and then use a leave-in. I don't know what they put in the conditioner, but it works so well. My hair is amazing after using this and most conditioners are not absorbed by my hair."
2,Oatmeal & Honey??,"I don't see either in the ingredients...INGREDIENTSDisodium Oleamido PEG-2, Sulfosuccinate, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Cucumis Sativus (Cucmber) Fruit Extract, Actinidia Chinesis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Coriandrum Sativum (Coriander) Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Parfum (Fragrance), Cocos nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Gardenia Tahitensis Flower, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Juniperus Communis Fruit Extract, Cananga Odorata Flower Extract, Aleurites Moluccana Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Polyquaternium-11, Retinyl Palmitat, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Citric Acid, Benzyl Benzoate, Coumarin, Eugenol"
2,Would have been better.,"Okay, this is the story. Naoko Takeuchi falls kinda behind on ""Sailormoon"". So Toei makes ""The Doom Tree Series"" or whatever you hardcore Sailormoon fans intend to call it. The plot is okay, but the animation got kinda sloppy and icky. But the worst thing that could happen to it was the DiC dubbing. I mean, what's with the name changing? And the voices, Usagi sounds like a 30- year old brat. Other than that, it was pretty much okay, but the Usagi and Mamorou crisis, it's just a little too much for an anime otaku."
3,very good though....,I don't see why they didn't stick with the manga the whole alien thing was stupid but considering it was preparing us for the R movie (admit it fiore looks like allen and ann)but overall it was good the romancitic conflict between mamo-chan and usa-ko I mean ann loves mamo-chan and allen loves usa-ko and usa-ko loves mamo-chan and mamo-chan loves usa-ko but doesn't know it yet and ann loves allen but she loves mamo-chan and allen loves ann but he loves usa-ko so there for if yur a die hard fan of sailor moon u should get this but if yur true to the mangas and don't wanna see anything like this don't well that's my 2 cents ja ne
3,Slightly Confusing and Not as Good as R,"The Doom tree series is an O.k. set, but for guys that look like Fiore, Anne and Alan really aren't much and this whole Anne loves Mamoru and Usagi loves Mamoru with Alan smitten with Usagi and Mamoru with usagi and all. hey it's still a fine movie set."
5,Sailor Moon- the dub appreciate it for what it is,"The Doom Tree series is arguably the worst season of Sailor Moon, but let's face it anyone who watches the dub has to expect this kind of thing, cutting and sometimes dumbing down of the language. But if you watch this series about Ann and Alan you have to appreciate it for what it is the excessive use of ""Hunkmeister"" and ""babe"" is actually really amusing so to all the SM fans please buy this video it will help bring more new episodes over and make Sailor Moon more popular in the states so we can crush Pokemon :o)"
5,Allen and Anne rock!!,"If you are a true moonie fan (Who doesn't mind the butchered DIC episodes) you should get this one! It has everything! Romance, Adventure, Mystery, Comedy, The arts (Snow White and the seven dwarfs), and of course, the best of all, ANIME!!! If you like anime, BUY it!!!!"
5,This movie is about love and hate who is good/Bad,This movie series is wonderful and I think that it is well written out to me it is a spark of more adventure for the sailor scouts! So I think that you take this movie to your home and watch it and then you will see what I mean!
2,*sigh*,"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon, to state its original title, was chopped, hacked, chewed, and spat out by the company that dubbed it. I regret having bought it. The music (WHY did they change Ail's flute? WHY!?), the CGI scene changes, names, some of the voice acting... it's almost painful to watch. However, if you don't mind the English dub and have the money for it, by all means, go for it. While I feel that the English version is far inferior to the Japanese original, that is only my opinion, yours might be different. To sum it up, if you don't mind the English dub, it's worth the money. ""Alan"" and ""Anne"" are so cute together in volume four, i.e. ""Food Fetish"" and the Snow White episode ^^;;"
5,Great Series!!!,"This is a great part of the Sailor Moon Series!! Also I wanted to correct some people on the names of the two aliens. Its ALLEN(or however they spell it) and ANN NOT any of this Ali and Ann bit, its ALLEN and ANN, got it? END"
5,Great Series!,I have seen the Season R episodes on Cartoon Network and bought this. The Series is about two aliens named Ali and Ann. Moon and The Sailor Scouts are reunited in the Season R episodes after how they defeated the Negaverse is Season 1. SAILOR VENUS RULES! END
5,What a Great Deal!,"This set ROCKS. It's four videos, with the entire Doom Tree series.(that means Alan and Ann) and I wish I had found it here. I went to a store and had bought it for over $55 dollars! My advice is, catch it while you still can! END"
4,Its not the best but its good!,I really Love Sailor Moon! I got this after like saving for a month! I think its kinda expensive! but Its really a preatty good series I was glade that they brought out the box set because bying those tapes with 2 episodes isn't a lot! I think its worth buying if you really like the North American Sailor Moon! I still think they could have picked a better series then the Ann and Alan ones cause Ann really gets on my nerves! And the fact that ann thinks she can have Derian! oh and really like Alan had a chance with Serina
2,"The animation was great, but the dubbing was horrible!!","For one thing, you can hardly hear Usagi's voice because her voice actress varies her tone so much. I also don't like the dubbing job with ""alan"". it just doesn't compare with the origianl voice at all.. my advice is to watch these episodes in their most natural form... subtitles!!"
5,Sailor Moon has a kiddie look but a teenage appeal!,I am a teenager and when I first saw Sailor Moon I thought it was kind of for the little kids. But after really watching the series I must admit it is the best anime I have ever seen! The Doom tree series was the best of the whole Sailor Moon series yet!
3,Don't get me wrong,"The series was great and all, but too musch stuff was cut out from the original Japanese series. I'm sorry to say that I was a bit disappointed to see all the cuts and mess up. The un-cut version is better. But over all it wasn't as good."
5,Please More Boxed Sets!,"Oh, An Anime dream come true! Thank you for the series on Tape! Please don't stop at this series, we'd like to see all the Sailor Moon Series in English and available! They are an excellent choice of Animated Videos for adults and kids!"
5,It's Sailor Moon!,What other explanation do you need? Finally the superhero makes the jump to VHS. Now if only all of the episodes can be put onto a commercialized tape...
3,Radio Flyer Trike,"Wonderful toy in my 15 month old's opinion. Screws holding top of frame (with handle bars) will not stay in wood, causing numerous repairs in the first day. Nuisance for the parents, but obviously my daughter doesn't care. It's her favorite gift."
5,Very Cute.,We got this as gift for our son's first birthday. We assembled it for him around 16 month and he got hooked to it with in few days. He enjoyed it very much till his second birthday.
3,Wrong Parts,"This toy was given to my daughter when she was little and she liked it. Then this year we purchased one for my niece, but when my husband was putting it together, one of the parts was too short, so my husband had to disassemble my daughters old scooter and use parts from it. We would have sent it back, but we got the scooter in the mail the day before the party so we didn't have time to send it back. We just improvised. I have to say we were not impressed."
5,Grandma makes a hit with Christmas present,"I bought this trike for my one-year-old granddaughter for Christmas. It was fairly easy for my son to put it together on Christmas Eve. She loved sitting on it and ringing the bell, but has not yet mastered getting it to move, although she does walk. I think it will be perfect for her in the Spring when she is about 15 months old. This trike is very well made and looks as if it will last through many children."
1,totally broken,"got this for my one-and-a-half yr. old's xmas present, a year ago. She loved it, and has ridden on it a lot, just round the living room. BUT, after only a year of use, it is totally broken. the handle tore right off. Not from rough use; just being ridden by two tiny little girls. My partner tried to re-screw the handle in, which worked for about a week, then it broke again, and now the wood is too broken to mend again. So, do not recommend. Any ride on toy is fun for this age, but this one is not durable. Not worth it if you hope to hand it down or have it be used for more than a couple of months of very light use."
1,"Not sturdy for long, bad customer service.","I had this trike for my first 2 kids. It broke while still in use by my 2nd. It was gently used, indoors. My children are not rough with their toys at all and rarely break anything (I know I just jinxed myself). This was a matter of poor quality. The assembly was done for us by the toy store where we bought it, so that wasn't the problem either.The steering column totally fell apart and when I contacted Radio Flyer about new parts that they claimed they would replace, I never received a thing. I am hoping to find something better for my 3rd child. This is way too expensive for the low quality that you get."
5,Radio Flyer trike is the best,I bought this trike for my grandson for his first birthday. He loves it. It is the right height and he loves the bell. It rolls well on carpets and flooring and is very stable and durable. There's a place for his feet so you can push him on it. It was worth the cost.
5,GREAT bike!!,I bought this bike a couple of years ago for my first grandson - we are now going on my second grandson! My first grandson loved it and now my second one is too - GREAT bike! Easy to get on and get off and not fall over with.
2,Too small and broke within 6 months.,"My son received it as a gift for his first birthday. It was already too small for him. It didn't stop him from riding it all over though. Within a few months, a crack showed up in the steering column. It didn't take long to break all the way through and now the steering is loose. I haven't been able to find replacement parts. Sounds like I got a defective one since all the other reviews call them ""durable""."
3,Too small.,"I think my son was already too old or tall (at 14 months) when he got this because he's never been able to stretch out his legs and go. He creeps along like an inch worm on it because there's no room for his legs, and his feet are always catching on the rear wheels. He loves it though and doesn't want to ride the larger bike that I got for him. :)"
5,Great toy for 12+ month toddler,"I bought this trike as a gift for my son's first birthday. He loves it. At first his legs were too short to reach the ground so we pushed him around the house on it. Now he rides it himself and sometimes pushes it around while he walks beside it.This trike is a great way help your toddler practice balance, steering and coordination. We love the classic look of it and the simplicity of design. So far we have not experienced any issues with quality and are ver happy with it. I highly recommend this product for newly and soon-to-be walking toddlers."
5,Best Trike I've found,"We bought this trike for my son when he was 1 and 1/2 and he loves it! It is made well, durable, yet light weight. It very rarely tips over, like other trikes we have found. He is able to steer and ride and keep up with his 6 year old sister while she rides her bike around the driveway. I highly recommend this trike! We have been very pleased!"
2,does not turn,"I agree with previous reviews. Our little one has been offered this toy and likes it very much, but got very upset when she tried to steer. The wheels do not follow the direction of the stiring wheel, it got loose and may even be dangerous for a kid; We tried to tighted the whole system so that it would not steer and she would only go forward or backward in one direction (less fun but more safe) but it did not worked since it keeps getting loose.I would not recommend this product unless you have a solution to this problem."
4,SUPER Great! But replace the bell.,"I got this Tiny Trike for my son when he was 8 months old, and, a whole year later, it continues to be a favorite.Only one reservation, and that is the bell. The bell that comes with the trike is cute, but pretty much impossible for children to make ring. You have to cock a hammer back and release it just so to get a ""ping."" My son was incredibly frustrated by it. We got rid of ours, and replaced it with aIncredibell Strawberry JelliBell, which comes in super cute colors and uses a simple turning mechanism to ring, instead."
4,Sweet and lasting,"My now 18-month old son was given this trike as a present for his first birthday. The good news is that he really loves it, and though it was a little fiddly to put together I was able to do it by myself. My son really does love it, and other kids on the playground crowd around with excitement when they see it. Plus, it is nice to have a trike this size that a baby his age can push easily and ""ride"" on (while walking his feet. This item is not as good quality as I expected from Radio Flyer in that the steering has always been a bit off, but my son loves it son much that I would definitly recommend it to anyone with a toddler."
4,Good trike,"My two year old boy like the trike. He is not that into bikes as of yet, but he does enjoy it. It is very colorful, and kids seem to like the bell and streamers. Good investment!"
1,Way too small!,"I bought this tryke last week and spent an hour assembling it. It comes in this small box and once assembled, it's still really small. My son is 20 months and is at the 25% percentile for height and he got really frustrated trying to ride it because the bike is too short for him and his legs kept bumping up against the front wheels. It looks like a miniature toy and is far smaller than trykes you see at the store."
4,Great for the shorter set,"This is a beautiful little trike, sturdy as most Radio Flyer items are.... But, my daughter at 15 months is too tall for this trike. Her legs are bunched up just a little too close to the front axle making her want to just sit with her feet up on it. I can't imagine too many 3 year olds being small enough to ride this trike, as the recommended age range suggests."
1,wrong order shipped,"As you can see from the order, the order was for Vishnupuran - 23 DVD set. Incomplete 16 DVD set was received. The payment was made by AMX. AMX has been informed about this problem. Unless the remaining 7(seven) DVDs are shipped to complete the order, payment will be witheld by AMX. I am disapointed how this order was handeled.Subin Verma"
2,Constant high-pitched squeal,"Has anyone else had the same problem.? The Amplified Terminator until emits a constant high-pitched whine or squeal, which is incredibly annoying. I even bought a new unit, thinking I just had a faulty one, and the new one was exactly the same. Other than that it works extremely well. But the whine is driving me insane. UPDATE: I managed to fix the problem by replacing the power supply. When I wrote to the manufacturer they admitted there was a problem and offered to send out a replacement power supply, if I lodged an official request through the seller. It's not good that they know there's a problem and are still selling the item. But at least they offered to fix it."
1,Don't buy this product if you have a large Plasma TV !!!,"I have a home entertainment center with a 65"" Panasonic HD TV. I spent several hours trying to get the Speakercraft IR system to work, I could not. The interference from the Plasma screen caused the ""BLUE"" light on the IR unit to glow constently, blocking the unit from transmitting signals sent from my remote control to my amplifier. My final test before returning the Sepakercraft IR unit was to power off the TV. Once I did that the Speakercraft unit worked perfectly controling my amplifier, then I powered up the TV again and the amplifier would again, not respond to the Speakercraft unit."
4,works well as an alarm,"I think it's perfect for children or adults for that matter. But for kids in foster care, they can set it beside their stuff (books/toys) and if some one comes into the beam it will alert the owner that someone might be near their stuff. I hope the foster adopted child our work bought gifts for Christmas will enjoy and use this."
3,ITEM DESCRIPTION ERROR - only detects movement up to 5 feet,"After receiving this item, I noticed that the packaging states ""Invisible beam detects movement up to five feet"". The item description in amazon states that it detects movement up to 20 feet. We haven't opened this item yet to see how well it works, but if makes a difference to you that it only claims to detect 5 feet, you should know now before you purchase it. I haven't decided if I will keep the item or not...the kids will probably still enjoy it."
2,Waste of money,I purchased this for my 8 year old nephew. The motion detector sometimes worked and sometimes did not work. We were both disappointed and he immediately lost interest in the it because of this.
1,absolutly Worthless Cheap Crap,I just recieved this bought it to let me know when someone enters the yardas im typing this review the product is on. sitting less than 6 inches awaypointed directly at me NOT A SOUND..only when I place my hand about 1 inch away from the lense it gives a low frequency beep like a kids toy.An Intruder would literally have to swallow this thing to alert me to his presenceand even thats doubtful .... going BACK!
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"Like the other reviewers have said, my daughter is a huge fan of Finding Nemo and Turtles: Sammy's Adventures. Anything to do with the water, she loves. So I saw this movie for $10 and bought it thinking we'd add it to our fish collection.It takes a long time before any ""plot"" gets going, scene transitions are non-existent (just jumps from one thing to another), characters are unlikable and mean to one another, violence and words that I wouldn't expect in a movie that has ""Family Friendly"" stamped on the front, and it was just overall boring and dumb. And then when the ending credits started rolling, I saw ""made by Al Jazeera Children's network"". WHAT?!?!This movie is going in the trash. I'd feel too guilty selling it to anyone, even for 50 cents."
1,Beware of Offensive language!!,"I have no idea why they would put this kind of language into a cartoon?!?! I heard what I thought was 'idiot' and 'go to hell' and I wasn't even watching it--just heard it from the other room. Needless to say, I sat down and started watching it with my 3 year old, and once what I thought I had heard, was confirmed---the movie went off and will not be played again in our house. And I also agree with another reviewer---it has a very 'dark' theme to the movie. And the crabs in the dark were very unsettling for my 3 year old who had lots of questions about them."
1,NOT for children!!!,"My wife and I purchased the DVD Sea Level expecting a Nemo like story, something sweet and full of positive messages. Instead, we found the plot deeply disturbing. The messages were dark and distasteful. We would not recommend this movie for anyone and doubt that it is suitable for children. After viewing the movie we discovered that it was written for and produced by the Al Jazeera Children's channel which we later found out is part of the Al Jazeera News Network. That is not a company we would have knowingly supported."
1,amazon wouldn't let me rate zero stars!,"how low can a movie go? It's dark, onfusing, stupid, aweful acting, slow, weird, and not for children. One of the characters repeatidly beats his children! Enough said!!"
1,It's not Nemo,"Slow, boring and confusing. This movie was painful to watch with my kids. There are plenty of better movies out there. Don't waste you time."
5,Fun Show to watch for the family.,Kids enjoyed this. They are five and six years old. It was easy to watch for the entire family as well.
5,It's not work when it's fun!,"This was a great dvd in that you can start off comfortably with the 1 mile walk and work your way up to the 3 mile Fat Burning walk. It's fun, the people demonstrating the exercises are a range of ages and body shapes - no super-buff, super-fit young adults to make you feel you aren't up to the exercise. The weighted balls that come with the dvd are comfortable to use."
5,My favorite,"I really enjoy this workout video because you have the option of a light, medium, or intense workout. The water balls are a little ""cheesy"", but they do the job. This workout video is great for winter time when you don't want to go outside!!"
5,Walk Away The Pounds,Walk Away the Pounds-Complete In-Home Walking SystemThis is a Great Product For Beginning a new exercise program. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to work out but doesn't have a lot of time to go running to a gym.
5,Easy to do--hard to give up!,"I really like this program! I had my doubts about getting a good workout walking at home, but since I am a homebody who hates belonging to a gym, I thought I'd give it a try. All 3 workouts are easy to do but really push you. I had been a real couch potato, and didn't know if I could do a mile, but the variations are perfect, in that just when you're ready to give up, you have a little change in the routine, and it lets those muscles relax and starts on a new set of muscles. I could progress past the mile in the first week!I like the weights! Even though I couldn't get them as round as in the video, they are soft and tacky, so you don't have to clutch them and build up tension in your arms. It's an amazing routine whether you use the weights or not, so I change up depending on my energy level of the day.I highly recommend this to folks who have bad weather and like to walk anyway!"
5,When this wears out... I will buy it again,"I love this DVD! I began walking one mile per night. When I felt stronger I did the 2 mile walk. A few times I've made the 3 mile walk. I love being able to go back to one mile if I'm not up to doing more. It's so simple to do you feel like a pro right away. Don't buy this DVD for the weights, they are pretty useless. Any weights will do, or no weights at all. The arm workout makes this so intense for me and I do it without the weights. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good in home walking system."
4,"DVD great, Weight balls not so much!","The dvd with this product is great even for a begin-again exerciser like me. It has several options for the length of walk desired and the walk can be done with just a few feet of space available.The weight balls included with the dvd are a joke. The user is suppose to fill them with water to inflate them. Much easier said than done. I am usually pretty good at following directions and putting things together. I've even built furniture and sewn curtains and clothing but I couldn't get passed step one with those things.The good news is that you don't really need them to do the workout. You can either skip the weights altogether or buy a set of light hand held weights to use.In my opinion they should just sell the dvd without the added ""bonus"" of the weight balls."
2,"great video, but has some flaws","I'm disappointed in this product and wish I wasn't an idiot who had thrown the packaging away; I would have returned it otherwise. The DVD is just in a cardboard sleeve (no plastic case like most DVDs). The weighted balls are a rip-off as far as I'm concerned. Getting them filled up with water is a major undertaking! After about half an hour of wrestling with them and my faucet, not to mention soaking myself and my kitchen counter, I managed to get one ball filled up to the 2-lb. capacity, but have given up on the other one (can only get it filled to maybe 1 1/2 lb.) My advice is to get regular weights or balls that don't require filling with water or air."
4,"Leslie Sansone's 3 in 1 ""Walk Away the Pounds""","This is a very good workout, but the enclosed ""weights"" are pretty much useless to me. I used my own instead."
3,Leslie Sansone,I think this product sat too long. The balls are not round and they do not round out when you fill them with water. They have creases in them from being in the box too long. The first workout was scratched and I lost quite a lot of time of the workout due to it.
1,DVD does not work,"This was my first time receiving a defective product from Amazon. I have never before ordered DVD's through Amazon. Although I am sure the DVD is awesome if it works, this one does not.I tried it in my laptop, desktop, and regular DVD player. Nothing...no result.Worst part is, apparently I do not have a recourse so I paid money for something that is defective and there is no way to return it. Um, o-k-a-y. Caveat emptor."
1,Great Workout - Horrible DVD Product,"I have used the Walk Away the Pounds VHS tapes and LOVE them. The workouts are simple - put them in and go. There are no hard choreographic steps to learn, so the workouts are very do-able. I also like how she includes people of various ages and body types.So, why the one star rating? Because the DVD does not play. I tried it in two DVD players as well as two computer DVD drives. The disc simply is not readable.Perhaps she has a newer release with the same content on better quality discs, but this production is a waste of money."
1,Leslie sansone DVD,This product does not work in Australia. It's not compatible with our system and so therefore I cannot use it. I am afraid returning it would cost more than it is worth.
1,DVD faulty,I was disappointed that the 3 mile Weight LOss Walk DVD was faulty at the end of the tape
1,Don't buy this DVD,"I bought 2 of them and they were both damaged. Neither DVD worked.No stars for this product. I was very disappointed. I returned it for a refund. Just so you know, I tested out the DVD in my neighbors DVD player just to make sure it wasn't my new player I just purchased.It wasn't????"
3,Good Walk,I bought this dvd on the referral of a friend. It's pretty good. I've already done the 1 mile walk and the 2 mile walk. Sometimes it gets a little annoying to hear the same jokes everyday...but I just turn the volume down...it's still a good workout.
1,firetruck wall hanger,it is cut my son liked it we hung it in his new remodeled bedroom all with firetruck theme
5,fun and frolic in Panama's Contadora,"this film has a very telenovela look about it which is interesting cause novelas are quite a phenomenon within latins. This romance unfolds on an Island off the gulf of Panama called Contadora where a recently engage couple gets involved with their tour guide. Some beautiful scenes of the island. It reminds me of one of my favorite films ""Summer Lovers"" with a great latin soundtrack. recommended."
3,It's kinda ok,"This movie has a good premise but inconsistencies with the story and plot really drag it down. For instance, a couple goes to this place and their guide has a thing for the guy and comes up with a scheme to get him alone. Well, it's the guy who ends up flirting with the guide and then it's the guy who gets angry when he finds out the guide's motives. And how he found out is a mystery. They fall asleep on the beach in each other's arms and then the guy all the sudden wakes up and says ""How dare you!"" It's like WTF just happened?And then he goes back to the hotel room and tells his finance that he just had sex with the guide even though that didn't happen. uhh...?This movie could have used a lot of improvement. A better script and about 20 extra minutes would have made this a good movie. But it's still worth a rental when there is NOTHING else to rent and you're desperate for something to watch."
3,instant camp classic,"Must be seen to be believed. Nutball direction (camera shakes, off-kilter framing), ludicrous script (with some lines repeated verbatim in successive scenes), and awful acting add up to this so-terrible-it's-great-fun entry. Completely entertaining in a perverse sort of way. It does have a sweet, innocent feel, but disparate elements keep that sentiment at bay. Three stars for high camp; one if you are taking this seriously."
5,Soul stirring Performance!!!,This is easily one of my Prized possessions -These are among the finest pieces of Music ever composed and this performance by Perlman and Ashkenazy is truly a glorious one reminding us that'A THING OF BEAUTY IS JOY FOREVER'.Of the two sonatas the SPRING is my favourite.What a longing and Poignancy Perlman brings in the opening movement and Ashkenazy is a perfect match in Restrained Elegance and Heroic Poise.The second movement is highly contemplative one and plumbing great depths.The anguish seems to have been resolved through some deep understanding and in the Third movement there is already a sense of having come to terms and a certain elan.The playing throughout is of the hightened sensitivity-truly marvellous.In these troubled times we cannot do better than to listen to these masterpieces by these truly great artists in order to revive our faith that there is within us the power to transform -the power of compassion!
3,"good content, bad record","the sound is not very clearly, yet the record is so far from nowadays, I recommend the BOX SET edition above this."
4,Good version of Venom,"This is the way Venom should have been done in the first place without it being a Wal-Mart exclusive. It's color accurate and just looks better. I had one problem with mine though. I have 3 of these and opened one, the paint they use to get that shiny look chips of easy so, for kids I would be careful but, for collectors..I would highly reccomend this. Get one before it's gone, these are very limited edition and once they are gone they are gone for good."
2,"If you like your toys to articulate, don't buy this","The legs don't push forwards. It's the dumbest thing. They can go out, like Venom's doing a jumping jack in midair, but he can't put one leg in front of the other like he's walking. For me, this is a deal-breaker. I like toys with lots of mobility/articulation.The arms are good, though.List of Articulation/Mobility/Poseability:Double jointed elbows, cut wrists, and shoulders that're on a swivel as well as being able to push up and out. Movable head, an abdomen that enables him to tilt his upper body side to side and back to front. His thighs can push out like i mentioned before and also rotate in place, so if you wanted him to put one leg in front of the other, you'd need to rotate them to the side so it will look very awkward as his inner thighs would be facing front. Double jointed knees. It's also worth noting that some of the movement is pretty rigid.Other than that, it looks really good."
5,Delicious!,"This is my default ramen, one that I always go back to. They come with five seasoning packets which makes me happy."
4,"Very cute, buy separately and save big $.","Very cute slice of life series, but very expensive . If you're interested in it you can buy the series individually for around $20 including shipping which is a lot better deal for such a short series."
4,Informative,"3.5. Informative read sprinkled with illustrative anecdotes and facts about court life, customs, arts, architecture and reality of the harem in a scholarly way, making it not just a long dull chronicle of politics. Gets a little dry sometimes and sometimes gets challenging to keep track of the giant cast. Makes me want to jet off to Iraq and visit the sites in Ukhaydir and Samarra. Alas, the magical old Baghdad is no more."
3,An opportunity missed,"When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World is a good, entertaining read. But like (almost) all popular history, it passes up the opportunity to teach something profound. The back cover says, ""Professor Hugh Kennedy's lively and compelling study shatters many of the preconceptions held by both sides and gives some indication of the roots of our current impasse."" No, it doesn't. It is good synopsis of the Abbasid period, but there is no insight. If you want a decent book for a lazy afternoon, this will surely suffice. But don't expect to be any wiser."
3,Readable,I expected books with more serious kind of information rather gossip type accounts with little indexing and cross-references. Otherwise has credible accounts but the doubt lingers.
3,Did the job.,"This was came fast and in good shape. It was very small and hard to find the sizing guide. It's made very cheaply, enough for a couple uses and that's it. Buy on larger, so you can layer your toddler in it. It Velcros in the back and isn't very warm."
2,Sizing was not correct,"The sizing stated ages 1-2, but what I received was more like 9-12 months. The look of it was really cute, but the material was too easy to rip. I would get it again for a one day use like halloween, but hope I get the correct sizing."
4,Crosley Entertainment Center,"The product allows me to play any type of music selection. Albums, tapes or cd's. I have quite a collection of all and like the flexibility. I liked the style as it matched well in the room I set it up. Bought exterior speakers for a better sound quality.Amazon made it easy to order. Shipping was accomplished much faster than I thought it would, and the product arrived well packaged."
5,Like all of Gene Watson's work it is outstanding.,"I am about to do something I have never done before. But, I've listened to Gene watson since the mid seventies when Capital released two of his albums on 78rpm. I wore them out and have never been able to find replacements. He is the best of the best. It is too bad capital doesn't re-released those two albums on CD."
4,Frikkin Awesome,"well after seeing them play in a driveway in good ol atlanta, i realized that this band was so freaking amazing. they went crazy with only about 35 kids there. talk about true hardcore."
5,Outstanding!,"I got this bad boy in the mail on Christmas Eve and I was very impressed with the quality and the talents of all the artists. Being one of the artists in the traditional section, I was a little apprehensive about they way it would turn out. But when I got the book I was floored! It's worth every penny and more!"
5,Touched by this book like no other before.......,"I read this book about a year ago and I cried the entire time. It was the most heart wrenching book that I have ever read. It literally made me sick but I could not put it down until I was through reading it. Then I went on-line and looked up more about this sad case. I had every one of my friends read it before I took it back to the library. It touched my heart and hurt me in an way you will never understand until you read the book. EVERY ONE NEEDS TO BE AWARE OF THE THINGS WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK! This little girl could have been saved by many different people that ignored(or didnt notice) the signs. Next time it could be you missing the signs of abuse, dont let that happen. Read the book, see the signs and save a life."
5,It is because of this book that I work with children today.,"Besides books about the Holocaust, this was one of the most difficult books for me to read. The fact that one human being, much less an innocent child, could endure so much is amazing to me. This book was a much needed slap in the face and because of it, I am now volunteering with children and I make sure that each and every one of those kids are able to come to me if they have a problem. I only wish Ursula had a person like that in her short life."
5,An Eye opening true story of Child Abuse,"I had to read this story in high school. It is the sadest story I have ever read in my life, it kept tears in my eyes the whole time. Just to think that one little girl lived like this her whole life, and to know that there are thousands of children out there who go through this everyday, breaks my heart."
5,One Touching book.,"My name is Lauren, and I live in Florida. I am in a class called Child Development at my high school and we were made to read this book as a class. It hit me with how lucky I am and how my parents could treat me like that, but don't. I don't think anyone will ever be able to really realize what Ursula had to go through. This book gives many great details of the torture she went through but we won't ever know how she really felt. What makes the story even worse is that the mother did nothing to prevent her boyfriend, Don, from hurting her daughter. This book has impacted my life tremendously and I hope it has yours also. For all those ones who find out a child or friend has been abused, go and report it-you may spare their lives instead of being killed from the pain and torture of being abused. This is a wonderful, powerful, touching book that should be in every home across the nation, and all the parts of the world."
4,The book was in great condition,I was very pleased with the product look like it was brand new even though it was used....I read the book already three times ...this happned in my home town and Ive been looking for it every where and a friends of mine told me to check Amazon. Thanks
2,buy another version,"This is a recording of the very disappointing recent London production. The singing is smooth but lacks depth and, as can be heard in the dialogue sections, the interpretations are not very convincing. The only exception is the marvelous Philip Quast, as Emile. Mary Martin remains the greatest Nellie with her wonderful warm ""mix"" of head voice and ""belt""."
3,sizing...,These are uni-sex sized so they did not fit right. They should state this in the description. I kept them because it wasn't worth sending back but very disappointed! The flip-flop itself is really nice and well constructed.
1,False Advertisement,"I was so excited about this offer because we were having a church function and our funds were limited. I order the tableclothes thinking that even if there was something was wrong with them, we could make them work. To my surprise, only one tablecloth was sent and the shipping was as much as the cloth!! Over $8 for one table cloth. When they say ""Buyer Beware"" they were probably thinking about these kinds of deceptions. I called and was told it was a printing error. Now we have no covers and wasted our time and money!"
4,"Pretty peice, but up close kind of cheap","I Liked the necklace a lot, and for what I paid, a great buy. Yet the beds look cheap up close. Then, again I don't plan on anyone inspecting it."
4,excellent exponent of stile brisee,"Pernot really knows his onions when it comes to the baroque repertoire. I understand that he took ten years preparing this recording. This recital shows off his brilliant technique and lucid interpretation of the greatest of the masters, E. Gaultier. The only fault one could find with this recording is the unflattering sound of his instrument. Perhaps its the gut strings he favors; there are many muddy and slightly sour sounds throughout. Perhaps if one had never heard the simply stunning recording by Hopkinson Smith 'The Old Gaultier',this recording would suffice. But in the end, one must say that this fine effort falls short of the earlier recording by Smith both in sound and that indefinable extra rhythmic nuance which makes this music really hallucinogenic in its beauty. I would definitely try another recording by this artist though and recommend this cd to those who want to hear the most lovely music at a very high level of competence."
3,Uhmmmmmmm...???,"I finished the book several days ago and I'm still not sure what I think about it. My wife loved it and insisted I read it. I've read so many ""thriller"" books lately that there wasn't enough originality in this one to make me wet the pages with saliva slipping off my chin. I knew the ending about twenty pages into it. I was, however, genuinely amused with the lead character-- I hesitate to call him a hero. He is a real horse's rear-end and he never fails to disappoint. That was refreshing. The actual ""evidence"" was incredibly flimsy to me. The rule seemed to be that if the author CAPITALIZED A LINE OFTEN ENOUGH THEN IT MUST BE TRUE. I realize that a lot of novels are based on assumptions that eventually get supported by fact in plot manuevering but this one was a bunch of assumptions that led to a final ""fact"" that seemed utterly improbable. But, it was entertaining. I'll give it that."
2,Half a great read!,"When Klavan is writing from the point-of-view of newspaper man, Steve Everett, this book rocks...it would have ranked a ten if Everett's was the book's only POV. It's when the other voices kick in -- Frank Beachum, his wife, the warden, etc. -- that the novel crashes and burns, as if Everett himself were driving his beloved Tempo into a brick wall. A big disappointment."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,THE ACTION WAS MISSING. THE TIMING WAS PERFECT BUT THE CHARACTERS NEEDED MORE DEVELOPMENT. NEEDS MORE WORK ON DIALOG. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU'VE GOT NOTHING BETTER TO DO.
4,"Very sharp, very unnerving, very good","Books of this style come thick and fast - the fact that it is identifiable in the midst of a plethora of quick paperbacks means that for once the marketing gurus have promoted a book that is justifiable well written. Not many books force me past the hour of midnight because they are so gripping - this one did. I also think Hamlet is intense and gripping, but Klavan has made every page so raw that one's fingers are ultimately attracted to going ""that one more page"" instead of turning in for the night. What can we say of this book in one quick summary? The latter third of the book is so beautifully crafted it has suspense that leads into the last three pages. When people yawn about formula-writing, Klavan takes the formula and tortures it to provide a white, crackling and stark message, and a muscle-flexing ending. Don't hesitate on this baby, it's got what it takes for the casual reader."
4,Novel writing at one of the finest stages.,"This Klavan novel started a little slow, but was quickly ressurected by the protagonist Steve Everett, a man I can really relate to. Steve is the kind of man who is just trying to squeek by in life, and can not help the predicaments he finds himself in. Now he uncovers a deeply buried false allegation that could send an innocent man to the gates of Heaven. I felt myself racing against the clock with Mr. Everett to be the savior of Frank Beachum's life. He cut the time right down to the wire and that is what I absolutely love the most about such novels. Klavan created strong and convincing characters, and moved the story with a consistant flow. I have decided to rank this novel with several other must reads. I have not been so compelled by a novel since Thomas Harris's The Silence of the Lambs!"
1,Hardly worth the shipping cost for anyone with experience.,"I bought this book for the Land Development aspects and was very disappointed. I am a successful building contractor and want to move in the direction of land development. Not the development of a single lot but the development of a parcel of land. This book is focused on going from owning a truck, having a skill saw and working for an experienced company to trying to fly on your own. This is not a bad idea but was certainly not what I expected or needed. Only the last chapter talked about ""land development"" and then only ""maybe you could buy a lot and build a house and then sell it."" Probably a decent book for the person who is just starting or wants to be on his own. A better title for this book is ""Start Your Own Construction Business"".A much better choice for experienced contractors is ""Be A Successful Land Developer""."
2,LT's Theory Of Pets,"This is the first audio book from Stephen King that I have purchased. I am a longtime fan of SK, and I was very excited to begin listening to it, being that it was a live recording. I found the story funny, but too short (it was less than an hour long). When the story ended I felt like ""That's it?"" I was a little disappointed at the length being that I paid $..., and that the ending was so abrupt. I felt like I was left ""hanging"". I guess I was expecting something a little better for the money, and from my favorite author. Big disappointment."
4,LT's Theory of Pets,"This unpublished story was read very well by the author. I enjoyed it and got a lot of laughs from it. It was even better since it was read in front of a live audience, that seems to add something to the atmosphere. There are plenty of jokes in it that you can't help but laugh at, especially since Stephen King reads them so well. The only two things I dislike about this story (as said so many times) it is terribly short and has a really... well, the ending is a cliff hanger. It would be great for Stephen King to rewrite it a little, add more parts to it, and make a better ending and publish it as a book or even re-read it in front of another audience. All in all it was a good story and if you're a great fan of his than you should definately add it to your collection, it's a classic short story, but has some minor problems. Definately pick this one up, but at a lower price."
3,"3.5 stars, but an important caveat","Stephen King's LT's Theory of Pets is a good, somewhat funny, slighty touching story of the demise of a marriage. It has some faint hints of horror at the end, but nothing to write home about. It's more in the spirit of the first three tales in Four Seasons -- a straight drama. This particular reading of it is enjoyable as King has a good reading style and the book is funnier heard than read.However, I can only recommend this to big King fans who have a yen to hear him read the story. LT, along with the e-book Riding the Bullet and Audio Book Blood+Smoke, is in the short story collection Everything's Eventual (see my review there). So if you're just interested in the story -- and could care less for the medium -- buy that."
2,Stephen King's Theory of Marriage,"Stephen King's new story, ""LT's Theory of Pets,"" is really less about pets than about the fragility of marriage. It's a theme that King seems to be fond of (especially in more recent years). Unfortunately, at least in this instance, King doesn't have anything to say on the topic that particularly revelatory. He goes to some trouble to evoke the emotions associated with a breakup, but there's nothing really substantial here about the internal dynamics of the relationship. In a way, this story puts me in mind of another one by King about the marriage state, ""Lunch at the Gotham Cafe"" (1995). While ""Cafe"" suffers from some of the same problems as ""Pets,"" at least ""Cafe"" was more entertaining, if only in a typically King-like gruesome manner. (""Cafe"" won the 1995 Stoker award for Superior Achievement in Long Fiction, and was nominated for the 1996 Locus for Best Novelette.)"
3,Mr. King let the professionals do the reading.,The writing is as good as always. But the enunciation perMr. King leaves much to be desired. Frank Muller does a muchnicer job of his works.
3,Interestingly Funny,"Okay I'll try to make this review long but its a short tape. I was very pleased with it. Stephen King shows off his funny witt in the start of the tape, and he tells the story very well as if someone in your family was sitting around telling it. The story is about a family a couple rather, who then end up getting pets. He tells the story of how pets can act like their owners. Its funny, and serious, and the ending did shock me. I liked this because it wasn't as long as his other book on tapes or his books rather. I listened to it in one night. Reason for the three stars is because I was expecting a bit more on the tape. I thought King had said on the second side there will be answers and questions and there wasn't. All in all it's funny, serious, and with a shocking ending. Or at least I thought so. So I would definately get this because its something different I think by King. But it will definately catch your interest in the start of the story :)"
5,The King-ster Live!!!,"I love to listen to Stephen read. That down-east Maine quirk in his speech is just very right somehow. The fact that this was done before a live British audience making it an interactive experience was a major plus!! They seemed to react differently at different parts than I would assume an American audience would. See if you don't agree. I won't delve into the plot or the characters (can't develop much anyway in 1 hour) but the adjective that keeps coming to mind is ""cute"". A tad spooky, a tad sad, a tad funny, a tad morose but altogether worth the [money] joy ride."
5,A definite sidesplitter,"Anyone who is married and has pets will greatly appreciate the humor and irony Stephen King dictates in this compelling tale/tail of people and their pets. My husband, who is not an avid SK reader like I am, has listened to this story several times and still laughs like it's his first time hearing it. And it wouldn't truly be a SK hit without the horror twist near the end. Hurray for SK and yet another wonderful chiller."
5,Stephen King Delivers,"""LT's Theory of Pets"" is a rare treat - a Stephen King audio CD that only costs (price). It's also a great listening experience. In a live recording Stephen King presents a funny, touching and in the end somewhat grisly tale in a manner that only he can. It is a tale about the relationships between husbands and wives and their pets. Steve is a great storyteller and in this instance shows that this ability is not limited to the written word. Most Stephen King fans will not need a nudge to get this item, but I encourage all those who are only occasional readers to check it out. You won't be sorry."
2,"Very strange, but what did I expect?","This started off interesting, but then it just got really weird. I would not listen to it again, and it left my husband and I both with an odd feeling...I would give it away to a friend, but I really don't want to subject them to it's weirdness."
4,Pretty good!,This was a pretty simple book. It gives pretty good explanations as well as follow up plans. I think it could have been a bit more informative on each subject instead what you have is a wide variety it does touch base on. Nice book to have on hand!
4,"Easy to follow. Written in a simple, non-alarming manner.","The book has been valuable to friends and family over the last 3 years. Answered important questions and recommended appropriate follow-up care. My doctor was impressed with my ""layman"" knowledge on certain subjects."
5,Served its purpose.,This product served its purpose. The player kept dropping so we needed to protect it . . .and it worked. No complaints
2,Lasted a year,"I can confirm what so many others have already said. The scooper is handy and the one handed action works well in grass, sidewalk or gravel and lets you carry a bucket in the other hand. I have a great dane and a newfoundland so picking up rather large ""deposits"" is what this scooper endured, and did alright. Now to the durability, which is why I am rating it so low. Everything is made of cheap plastic and parts start breaking. The springs come off, the pivot points break and finally the lever arms break and it's done. The worst thing is that there is no warning. The tool just breaks without showing any wear or poor function until it all just falls apart.Note to the manufacturer, I would be willing to pay 3 or 4 times as much for this same tool made of aluminum or some other high quality and light weight material."
3,Jaws Strong / Plastic weak,Bought two of these products.One I use for a couple of months before the plastic gave way the Jaws were strong but could not support the plastic.The other one I used a few times before the screw that held the jaws together crack had to insert a screw to make it work.I feel if the plastic was constructed better it would work better with the jaws.all and all it did work well .
1,It could have been a contender!!,"I cannot review the performance, or lack thereof, of this product as I did not get to use it. It arrived in the box broken right where the cheaply made plastic attaches to the metal jaws. Therefore, it never would have closed to pick up the poop I so wanted to have removed from my yard. Now it (the poop) is frozen solid on top of the grass until spring arrives in Ohio, which could happen anytime after the month of May!"
1,Broke first time I used it,"As far as the experience of obtaining the item it was great (fast and efficient). I can't justify the cost of this item when it breaks on the first time I used it. I was out there cleaning up the back yard and looked down to see the pin that attached the arm to the claw piece fell out. I rigged it with a wire tie and it works but for it to break that quickly is not at all impressive. If your grass hasn't been cut it's not easy to get to the dog messes either so I would not recommend buying it. Doesn't work well enough to justify the cost and combine that with it breaking, it's a waste of money."
1,Ineffective...rake-type scooper much better...,I had already bought the Wire Rake Scooper for Grass and then decided I needed a 2nd pooper scooper so that I had one both in the front and back yards. This scooper does not do nearly the same efficient and effective job as a Wire Rake Scooper. Such so that this is my first review of a product ever on Amazon and I order from Amazon on a regular basis.
5,excellent scooper!,"This poop grabber does a great job. It's pretty sturdy. I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers are saying about it being a bad grass ripper. I don't have many problems and sometimes I'm dealing with some longer grass. Maybe I just have a good technique? :-)The first one I received was broken, but the seller sent me a free replacement very fast. I was very happy with the service I received."
1,"Flimsy design, returning the one I just bought!","I have bought two other brands of these type of poop scoops in the past, but this brand is not constructed well at all. In fact, I just received it about ten days ago and the first time I used it I couldn't figure out why it seemed to not work very well. The jaws do not meet and it's hard to get the poops in the holder. Then today (the second time I've used it) I noticed that a little piece of plastic (very flimsy) is broken and that is why it doesn't work correctly. I'm now notifying Amazon to return it and I will buy a different brand offered by Amazon."
5,THIS IS GREAT!,I just used the Flexrake Jaws pooper scoop for the first time. The grass was wet; the poop was wetafter days of rain. This works great! I have injuries that don't allow me to bend over. I was able tostand and get almost all of it out of the grass - even some that had been mushed into it by the gardeners. Best clean-up investment I've made in years of owning dogs.
1,Cheap Plastic Flimsy Junk,"This arrived broken. The ""jaws"" are held together with 2 small plastic pin on either side and a plastic washer. One of the pins had snapped off and as a molded one piece cannot be repaired. Moreover, I looked in the box for the washer and it wasn't there. This product was shipped broken. As to shipping it took the full 10 days = of 6 items I ordered the same day from Amazon, this one was the only one that didn't arrive within 5 days. I read the other reviews before I ordered. We can't be talking about the same product."
5,Flexrake 33P is a wonderful invention at a good price,"Flexrake 33P Jaws Pooper ScooperFor years I've been bending over in the yard and using an old garden trowel to pick up after my dogs. With the snow just melted here in the Northeast, I had quite a bit to clean up. Really glad that I had this tool. I used it along with a small plaster bucket lined with a garbage bag. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has dogs. The bigger the dog or the more dogs that you own - the more you need this product. It's a good investment at a great price."
3,Not durable enough,"I've had my Flexrake Jaws Pooper Scooper for just over 1 year. Today, it broke while I was using it. The plastic is thin around the point where most of the pressure from the springs is applied. My guess is that they designed it this way so you'd have to replace it every couple of years. It did work well while it lasted, but I would expect it to last at least 3 to 5 years!"
1,"Do not buy this, unless you want to replace it in 6 weeks.",This is the same product they typically sell at PetsMart and they break very easily. I'm hoping to find one that will last. First the hinge pins break between the lever arms and the scoop halves. I fix that by inserting a screw where the pin was. Then the lever arms snap off the center member and there's no fixing that.
1,"good, but then it broke","i bought mine at petsmart. i thought it was a great alternative to the typical rake and ""dust"" pan style of traditional scoopers. it worked great until it broke after only 3 and a half weeks. the plastic arch attached to the jaws snapped in the middle by the springs. very disappointed. would love it if it hadn't broken so quickly"
2,lasted two months then broke,Lasted only two months then it broke! Very upset my last scooper lasted two YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Won't buy this brand ever again.
3,Worked okay... once,"This worked great, but be advised if you've got decade-old caulking like I do, this is a one-time-use tool. I went through two of them clearing out the caulk one one shower door (four beads). I had to finish with a screwdriver. If you've got a big job, buy several.And, Amazon is selling this for more than twice the price as WalMart or Lowes.EDIT: I've seen the light. Go to the painting section and buy yourself a nice scraper. Depending on the job, a scraper will serve you much better."
3,Did Not work For My Purpose,"I bought this hoping that it would be deep and narrow enough to fit between a sinktop and the wall. Unfortunately, it was still too wide to fit in the narrow opening, and I ended up using a small screwdriver and a small pair of needlenose pliers to do the job.I wish this had worked for what I wanted it for, but I have saved it for the eventual need in the shower base, where it will be able to get into the place I would need it.To echo the other comments, I agree that this tool loses it edge very quickly. Mine started to dull just from trying to fit it between the back of the sinktop and the wall. I was also using a caulk softener product. The caulk I was trying to remove was indoor/outdoor caulk and very tough, admittedly. I think it would work a lot better on caulk that is meant to be used in a bathroom, which would start out much softer."
1,Don't waste your money...,"I bought this tool to remove old caulk from a showr door that had been removed. Within 10 minutes the bottom edge broke off, then, while using the corner edge, that broke apart as well. as echoed in the other reviews, the edges do also become dull very quickly and was unable to finish trying to use the broken edge because it got too dull. went back to the store and bought a small, flexible putty knife. worked wonders and got a nice clean and close removal."
2,Poor,"The book describes research on fairly interesting subjects written with poor grammar. Then it poorly relates it somehow to the bible. For instance, the section on the difference between catsup and ketchup ends with ""people want the bottle of red sauce, but if people want to get to heaven, the bible tells us that Jesus is the only way..."" What??If you buy this book, buy it for the facts, not the religion."
1,Beware of bulb problems,"I own two of these lamps and loved them until the bulb burned out! Replacement bulbs are EXTREMELY difficult to find. Fortunately I bought a replacement bulb for it but I have yet to find an online source for these bulbs and they certainly are not available locally, as far as I can tell. The store where I orginally bought the floor lamp no longer sells the 3"" size magnifier so I am still searching."
3,"an alright album, i 'spose","i actually liked 'defiance' better than 'storm'. i just think it sounds like tom shear is a little tired of making hits. i can picture him in the studio making the vocals and yawning from boredom. not that the cd isn't good, i mean, it's assemblage 23 for crying out loud, but i like his other cd's better. if you're new to the genre or the artist, try 'failure'. if you're into assemblage 23, you'll like this cd. but not as much as his earlier stuff"
3,"good, but...","My jaw literally dropped when I saw nothing but 5-star ratings for this CD. I've been a big A23 fan for a couple years now, but it's been my opinion that each album he makes has been worse than the last, all the way back to Contempt.This album is undeniably catchy, which is more than I can say for many parts of Defiance, but unfortunately most of the songs on this album just sound the same. Similar tempos and similar melodies PLAGUE this album. Structurally, each of the songs on this album is damn near identical. It shows either a great amount of cynicism or unoriginality on Tom Shear's part, and I can honestly say I expected more out of him on this go.Best tracks - Human, Ground, Apart, 30kft"
5,Excellent Album,Seems Assemblage 23 just gets better and better. Every song has that bite. Very danceable. This album is great to work out to. Lyrics are emotional and strong. Beats are fresh. I was very pleased.
3,More of the same...,"Metropolis is a little deceiving with the exclamation in their review that Storm is the ""most complex Assemblage 23 release to date"". In my opinion, it is just the same as the last two Assemblage 23 albums, with some extra production polish added on. There really isn't anything else to say about this album beyond that though, if you consider everything that was on the last two albums. The synths are all the same somewhat mellow yet fast paced trance synths with Tom's monotone voice singing over them. The song content can be somewhat predictable as well, but it is also appealing to a moody individual (such as is the character that Tom takes on when he sings in his songs.)Storm is a decent album, and is recomended for those who haven't heard Assemblage 23 yet or are big fans of it. It is a little boring though after listening to about 5 tracks of it, because sadly, it all starts to sound the same by the end..."
1,Doesn't Work with 30 PSI,"I purchased this filter based upon the product manual from the Hayward Website which stated that it is rated to a maximum working pressure of 50PSI. When the filter arrived it was marked as rated at 40PSI maximum. My system operates in the 30-40PSI range and the filter top continually ""blows"" off from the main filter body rendering it useless. I am currently trying to work with Hayward to determine if it is a defective part or just a poor design. To date they have not resolved the issue nor been helpful. Most pool systems operate in the 10-20PSI range so perhaps this product works as advertised at that lower range.Amazon shipped the product exeditously as promised."
5,Awesome Buy!,"I highly recommend this sand filter. The pool place here where I live wanted $450.00 dollars for this same type of filter. I would also have to have a truck to pick it up. The delivery with free shipping was great. The sand filter was at my door in 2 days. Everything arrived as shown and worked like a charm. You do have to buy the sand,hoses and clamps which are all in-expensive if purchased at a pool place or Wal-Mart. I am very pleased with this product and you would be crazy not to but this!!!!!!!!!! I hope this helps because I know when I read the reviews it made my decision easier."
4,Hayward S180T Pro Sand Filter,Very happy with the purchase of the Hayward S180T Pro Series 18-inch Sand Filter. It arrived in a timely manner and included everything it was supposed to have. We purchased the sand recommended for that filter at our local pool supply company. We are using a 2 HP motor and it works great. Such an improvement over the small filter that came with our pool.
3,"I like it, but like other reviews mine was missing the base","Easy to install, works really well, and did it's job, but when I received it, like others, it did not have a base. I built my own, but this could be a problem from some who expect this to come with a base. Worked great so far, but the missing base is an issue!"
5,Great Buy,We had to replace our sand filter in our inground pool and I called several local pool places the the price was just under $400. We were lucky to find the same item at Amazon for less than $200. We had a family friend replace the old filter and it worked like a charm I would highly recommend Amazon for your pool needs.
3,Brunswick Power X Right Handed Glove,"Pretty decent glove. For an extra large glove, this glove runs a little small. I have to work with it for a while before I can get into it....."
4,Le Sueur,I have to agree with other opinions. This music is striking. Le Sueur also co-operated on the music for Napoleon I's coronation as well and I think bits of these cantatas might be re-cycled. I'm boasting but it seems apropos. I bought this cd in the souvenir shop on top of the Arc de Triomphe so it has special associations for me anyway. It's a great listen and beautifully recorded. I notice on the cover they show Napoleon but the music is actually for the restoration of the bankrupt Bourbons.
5,"TITO PUENTE JR ""Greatest club remixes""","The best in latin dance music worldwide hands down! 12 slammin tracks for your car,club,gym or anywhere you can dance. Make no mistake this is an awsome cd for your party. Latin dance music at it's finest!!!!!!!!!"
2,soundtrack for dopamine,"Just saw the movie and enjoyed it very much. Looking all over for the soundtrack's last song, Bob Dylan's ""Sara"" sung by Tim Hockenberry. Allmost bought the soundtrack. Thanks for the save. I most definitely would have been very disappointed. Anyone know where to buy the song?"
4,Persuasive... worth the money spent!,"This book was effective in piquing my curiosity into an area that I tend to steer clear of (religion, that is).The book is a must for those who believe that the greatest rational thinkers in history were devoid of religious faith. If you can be persuaded without the occurrence of an actual miracle, then I recommend you read the book. The author has impressively collected hundreds of citations from letters and diaries of some of the greatest thinkers of our time, and successfully put forth an argument that will cause even the most determined agnostics to wonder.The book is well written and beautiful in its composition. There are many illustrations, which make it a wonderful idea for a Christmas gift."
2,Disappointing,"I couldn't wait for this book to arrive and when it did I unpacked a beautifully presented book. However, once thumbing through it, I realized it was nothing more than pages of quotes and/or short representative works of Great Minds who did believe in God. The author did mention that there were other Great Minds who where agnostic or atheist, but there were neither sampling of names nor comparative beliefs. The illustrations are very nice, but I found my expectations of this book to be very different than what was presented."
4,Correction,"The date for the awarding of the ""Angel Award"" is incorrect. The awarding took place in 2001. Please revise. Michael Caputo (Author)"
2,Doesn't quite fit right and bulky,"The plastic cover actually damaged my screen. And, the material stretches and doesn't quite fit right. Plus, it's really bulky and gets dirty."
4,"it works, but doesn't last ;(","I think I'm the only one who have this problem (if you agree or disagree feel free to respond back), but about 3 days after using the whitestrips.. my teeth starts turning yellow again (yes I do brush them day and night for at least 2 mintues). During the therapy, the thing works great, I see my teeth whitens very quickly. Though there are some sensitivity, I was fine with that. I applied it just as instructed, with only 3 days of skipping because my teeth was very sensitive. I wonder why my teeth turned color after the use of the whitestrips."
3,"Really whiten, but causes very sensitive teeth!","I used them as directed and did notice definite whitening of my teeth, however I had to discontinue for a while because it caused extreme sensitivity to my teeth. It was too painful to continue."
5,They work !,First thing I did was read reviews. The supreme version seemed to be the winner. I bought a 42 pack / 21 days. I noticed a difference with in a couple days. I just finished the package and I'm very pleased with the results. 21 days is more than enough. My wife told me today that my teeth are white again. Thumbs up for a great product!
4,Let's Add On The Way Back Home,"I'll agree with the other reviewers that the album is too short. I've always loved On The Way Back Home. The song is on my iPod and songs don't get on my iPod lightly. I'd Be So Happy is also on my iPod. So, along with the three hits and these additional two songs, Hard Labor has five great tunes. That's better than most albums. So in my book the math adds up to justify 4 stars.The sound on CD could be better. The album always had a flat sound and the CD isn't much better.Hard Labor does have the full length ""The Show Must Go On"" which clocks in over a minute longer than the 45 version on all other Three Dog Night CD's. The only other place that I know of where the full length version of The Show Must Go On appears was on the 8-track tape of 3 Dog Night's Greatest Hits."
2,unusable fork,"This is the Coghlan's ""Deluxe"" chow-kit No. 8322.The knife and the spoon are actually quite nice, but it looks like they changed the design of the fork so that the fork is basically unusable. Instead of the widely spaced tines, they're now maybe a bit over 1mm apart. Also, the center tine has a thick blunt tip instead of a tapered spike. So it's basically like trying to stab your food with a blunt tipped knife (check out the uploaded photo).Also, these things are much cheaper at the local REI (like ~$4) - so it may be worth going to your local camping gear store and only buy if it has the usable fork design."
5,A must for white lion die hards,Like a greatest hits on the 1st cd but the second is pretty much all live from the 1988 show at the ritz in nyc
5,"Yes, absence does make musical tastes grow fonder","I totally agree with the other 3 reviewers regarding White Lion: The Definitve Rock Collection. It's been at leats 12, 15 years since I've heard'When The Children Cry' and it sounded as though I heard for the first time. It's a beautiful piece and, yes, it turned me into a fan of the band again. I'm anxious to hear everything again. I am curious why 'War Song' from 'Mane Attraction' was ommitted. Other than that, I cannot at all complaion about the selection of tunes and even the live versions as well.It's hard to argue the impact the 80's had on the musical landscape. White Lion were part of that.....and remain a part, too."
5,DESCRIPTION NOT CORRECT...,"As we all know, Destiny's Child's new album is MORE than great! Any time we can get anything with them in it...whether it be videos, or cd's...we jump at the chance. The description says that there is LIVE footage from their '04/'05 concert on this...when in reality it's from their old concert (as seen in ""Destiny's Child World Tour"" DVD). I ordered this item thinking it was new footage from the '05 tour like the description says and was very disappointed that it wasn't. I hope they do release a DVD of their newest tour when they've finished touring. It would be wonderful to experience it again! Long live DC3!!!!!"
4,Great Indiana Book,"What a great coffee table book. It's got a great combination of high-quality photos and real, interesting information about the state of Indiana. Giving facts based on the letter of the alphabet is creative, and the overall layout of the book and its information is very high quality."
1,Multi-Cultural Teacher,"I was very excited when I purchased this book. I thought it was a great idea to teach children about the state. However, I do not feel that the author spent anytime researching the state of Indiana. Also, there is not any racial diversity in this book. If one was to look at this book, they would think Indiana only has caucasion americans living in the state."
1,Didn't read,I unfortunately did not read all the requirements because it works for XP and not Vista! So who knows how it works. :{
1,Audio Gateway Issues,"As a previous reviewer detailed, this device does not provide the audio gateway necessary for use with bluetooth headsets. One reviewer did report positve results with a Logitech MobileFreedom headset, but I have have failed trying with the Motorola 820 and a Platronics 510. In other areas this device performs as expected. However, connecting to a bluetooth headset was important to me, and for that reason I cannot recommend this device."
4,Annoying PalmPilot Internet Setup,"Works Incredibly well. I have a Zire72 and I can sit on my neighbor's porch and surf the net from home. Installation happened just as instructions said. But, If you want to surf the net on a palmpilot using bluetooth it takes a' bit of work.First of all you have to go to your device manager in Win XP and find your bluetooth device and tell it to search for an updated driver. That's for all USB bluetooth devices. Lynksys has those instructions on their website, which is a strike against IO Gear & PALM not providing all the information on their support sites. I honestly plan on buying a HP next time because of lacking support from palm.(...) Great Product, lacking support, and Good Luck."
4,Hashisheen - a Journey,"Great conceptual album, with the participation of inumerous quality artists. Brings a completely new perspective to the theme of Islam and Hashish."
4,Very interesting,"Laswell will bring you on a journey back in time. If you like laswell's work, this spoken word album should find a place in your collection."
4,"Good, but...","The description for this item needs to be revised. The water tank is NOT detachable as the description claims. Otherwise, this is an excellent iron. I've had several of the B&D brand that weren't worth the money, & this has replaced the last of that brand I'll ever buy."
1,Discription was a lie,The product was described as having a detachable water tank for filling away from the unit. This was a complete LIE. Even the users manual sent with the item states that it is filled with a whole on the unit. Further my order was never confirmed either with me or with amazon. I was credited and recharged due to a lack of comunication. Further the item was poorly shipped with no padding in the box. I would be hard pressed to ordered from chumbadeals again
5,None better than Nose Better!,"Well, my wife had to have Nose Better rather than any other nasal product. She loves it to help in opening a stuffy nose. Great product."
3,As advertised but cap needs to be redesigned,Gel has a menthol scent that helps open nasal passages. I sometimes use this before working out as it helps me breath. This does not provide any moisture so if that is your issue it's not the product for you. The one complaint that I have is the cap is very difficult to get back on. Probably wouldn't stop me from purchasing again
3,Not what I was hoping for,I thought this product would be more like Ponaris but a little less expensive. I tried using it like ponaris at first and plopped a large-ish glob into my nose/sinuses and it kind of stung like hell. It then made me sneeze a lot and made my nose burn and freeze at the same time. It is more like vapor rub than a nasal emollient. It made my nose run from the strong smell so I imagine if you are stuffed up it would be pretty good but I was looking for more of a sinus emollient.
5,The best to repair chafed noses...and allergic sneezing,"While I don't always have allergies...it happens sometimes. This product is one of the best products if you are suffering from sneezing from allegies...it not only helps the sneezing, but also helps repair chafed noses!!! It is a little pricey...but worth it! Longs Drug Store stopped selling it in Hawaii since CVS took over. Haven't been able to find it at any other store here."
1,Haven't received it YET!,"I'm sure it's a great book; however, it's now Nov. 7th and still no book. Was for a gift that was to be given on Oct 20th. Suppose I need to follow up!"
4,For the Meat Lover in all of us!,Some great recipes from a family in New York that's been doing it for quite awhile!
5,whoa! I like :D,Hm.... I really liked the history information in the front about fashion and looks and beauty - it reminded me that the concept of 'beauty' has not always been the same and that embracing yourself is the most important.
3,Criterion version also has Otis Redding's performance,"The main difference between this and Criterion is that Criterion also has Otis Redding's performance, also Criterion is Region 1, whereas this version is all regions."
1,Bad Copy,"Bought this for a Christmas gift, so did not test it before sending it on. Once it got to the recipient, they opened it and began to play it. Everything was fine until three-quarters of the way through. Then it was unable to play. Upon closer inspection, there were holes that went through the case and into the disk. I mentioned this in a note and never heard back from anyone....the seller or Amazon. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but I'd say ""Buyer Beware""."
2,Jimi Hendrix Live at Monterey,This DVD id disappointing unless you like a lot of dialogue. Very short video footage of the left-handed wizard in action. Not recommended for a music DVD collection but does have some historical value.
5,Showcase of the power & raw talent of an Electric Guitar Genius!,"I had previously seen some limited clips of Hendrix' performance at Monterey but never the entire set. I was truly blown away. In the interest of full disclosure, I am a huge Hendrix fan but I can be objective when it comes to comparing various works by Hendrix (I have see & heard some of the bootleg garbage out there and also when Hendrix' performance was sub par). The raw talent of Hendix is quite evident throughout and it appears as though his guitar is just another appendage of his which he uses almost involuntarily. There is talent and hard work and then there is a gift. Hendirx certainly did work very hard at his craft but he was certainly a gifted musician whose contribution to rock music was all too brief. Even though his professional career was very short, he contributed a tremendous body of work which establishes his position in history as the greatest, and most innovative, electric guitarist of all time."
3,Sun CR 18 Rims,I am happy with the rims overall. They are silver and not polished so they are pretty dull looking. They are clean and sturdy but a pinch on the heavy side. They are new and fresh and will keep my vintage ride rollin'.Sun Alloy Rim 700c CR18 Silver 32 Hole PVGreg
3,Red on the Seat,"This toilet seat is pleasing to the eye and I believe it will be very serviceable. However, there were four red rings on the seat, on the top side that were beneath the finish and could not be removed without sanding the piece and refinishing. Apparently the rings were some kind of marking for placement of supports or something. Aggravating to say the least. You expect to recieve a brand new item ready for use."
4,wrong fit,"I should not have ordered the elongated seat... The regular seat would have fit better... The bowl IS oval, but not as elongated as this seat... Does not bolt down right so that the seat stays up by itself... Must hold it if you want it up... Oh,well, my mistake, my problem... Is too involved to send back... Kept it..."
1,so bad!,"Please don't buy it!!!It seems like an idiot singing love songs, when he (or it) doesn't know at all what love is.Stupid words, boring melodies and a sense af nausea is what i feel listening to this cd. SO don't waste your money! If you pay a woman you will spend better your money!!!!!!"
5,Argentina's Wild Ride,"A fast paced enjoyable read. Paul Blustein tells the story of the rise and fall of Argentina's economy in the roiling seas of free trade and free markets of the nineties in the style of a novel. His behind the scenes look at the International Monetary Fund were very elightening and throughly entertaining.Motives and ambitions of leaders are not always spelled out when reading about the fits and starts of South American economies like Argentina in the North American press, but reading this book sheds bright light on thinking and actions of dicision makers as they explain thier actions.Entertaining and informing."
3,Titles....,"The Heartland stories are good, but the titles are very weird. I mean, ""Thicker than Water?"" What does that have to do with horses? ""One day You'll Know?"" ""Breaking Free?"" ""Love is A Gift?""No offense or anything, but these titles should change or something."
5,Do the hits ever stop?,"Amy is now faced with emotional stress when her father comes to Heartland... the last thing that Amy wants. Lou is excited but that doesn't last for long. She gets angry at her dad the very day he comes! Amy though, can't ignore the feelings she has found of love for her dad, especially because he loved Pegasus so much. Amy is stressed with this. After how much she hated him, and now, the tables turned. What is Amy gonna do? Read, and remember anything is possible at Heartland."
5,One of the Best!!!,This book was one of of the best out of all of them! This book was all about amy and lou getting closer and helping lou with her fear of riding. Also amy and lou's father comes to vist. amy is not sure if the vist is going to go well or not. she really doed not want him to come but lou can't wait!! when their father comes amy wants him to leave but lou is having a great time! By the end of the weekend amy doesn't want her father to laeve! Lou spent most of the weekend working the stuff for the meeting with the bank for a loan to buy more land for Heartland. amy and their think that lou has a fear of riding but lou told them is doesn't. at the end of the book lou tells amy and her father that she has been for a long time and maybe the next time he comes to vist they come go riding together.Does Heartlnad get more land?
5,A great book,"This book was very good. I was surprised that Amy (Main character) and Lou's (Amys sister) father left them. I was very happy at the end when all of the problems are solved. Their is actually a good ending to this book. There were some surprises that I never guessed would happen so it is not that predictable. I loved this book, and if you like it too I suggest that you read Terri farleys books. So get reading and have fun."
5,Royal Rumble 1998 is by far the best Royal Rumble yet.,"This WWF Royal Rumble was just awesome ever match was very good, Vader vs Goldust (C+) a very good opening match up then there was the minis match wich was realy good its like watching wcw cruserwhights fight (B-) then there was the Ken Shamrock vs the Rock match with was alot better then wrestlemania 14 match with Shamrock and the Rock (B) also the tag team chapionship LOD vs New Age Outlaws (C+) and the Royal Rumbel match (A+) the best ever Rumbel, and the main event HBK vs Undertaker this match is awesome (A-) overall the best Royal Rumbel yet alot better then Royal Rumbel 1999 wich was not that good olny good match was the i ouit match wich was good with manking and the rock but the 1998 Rumbel is a must buy."
3,Royal Rumble '98,"An above average card paving the way to Wrestlemania. The beginning of the WWF year plays host to the resurrection of a main event screw-job between 'Taker and Michaels, the rise of Austinmania, and heat generated by ""The Rock"". For Austin and Michaels' fans only. END"
2,Royal Rumble 98',"This event was a bit of a stretch, The stage was set with Stone Cold Steve Austin being a marked man. Well, so the rest of the show was about him. Even in matches not about him, the commentators spoke of Austin. The Rumble match was below average. The result was predictable as anything the WWF/WWE has put out since. Austin did carry himself well though. The best match on the card was the Casket match between Michaels and The Taker. Great match, too bad about Michaels injury on the casket. What a sad day. The Rock/Shamrock match was great to watch, but the end was sick... That's saying a lot since my two least favorite wrestlers are Rock and Shamrock. This is worth the money if you find it for under 13, as I did. But I recommend getting the Classic Five of 98 box, it's far more valuable, of course if you don't have the other already."
2,Stupid,All the matches were boring with the exception being the Rock/Shamrock match.The Rumble was very predictable and not enjoyable.Why not let someone else win like Billy Gunn or the Road Dogg?I am tired of the Same guys winning the event over and over!
3,Royal Rumble 1998,"Overall this rumble was decentGood matches6 man tag team dwarf matchVery cool match, everyone is flyin 7/10Rumble matchWhile somewhat boring, this rumble match was stillvery interesting 6.5/10IC TitleRock vs ShamrockNot too bad of a match, but the ending really sucks6/10WWF TitleCasket MatchShawn Michaels vs UndertakerFabulous match, with a questionable ending9/10the rest really wasn't that good"
1,WWE Royal Rumble 1993!!,"This is Mudd.

3,HBK survives Casket Match!!!,"Goldust v. VaderVery boring match. Yet very fun. It was a good opener but Vader wins.**Max Mini, Nova & Mosica v. Battalion, El Torito & Tarantula 6-Man TagFunny as anything but it was horrible action. Max Mini's team wins the match.***for how funny it was.The Rock v. Ken Shamrock IC TitleThis match is very overrated. It is not as good as people say it is. Rock wins when he cheats because he puts the knucks in Shamrock's tights.***New Age Outlaws v. Legion Of Doom World Tag TitlesAbsolutely a classic match. This was the Legion Of Doom's greatest match ever. New Age Outlaws retain.*****Royal Rumble MatchA great Royal Rumble. Foley comes out as 3 different guys. I don't care if Austin won this was still a great Rumble.****1/2Shawn Michaels v. Undertaker World TitleBOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Kane screws Undertaker and Shawn retains. That's enough said.***"
5,Pure Excitement,This was great! Non stop action. It started out great and ended great with the unforgetable casket match. Undertaker vs. micheals. Even the midgets were great. Also look for a very good match for the IC title. Shamrock vs. Rock. Very exciting and interesting.
4,WWF Royal Rumble 1998,"Goldust w/Luna Vachon vs VaderGreat opening match to the Pay Per View. Great ending. 8/10Six-Man Mini MatchNo storyline. But absolutely funny to watch. 7/10WWF Intercontinential ChampionshipThe Rock (C) vs Ken ShamrockGreat technical matchup. One of the best in 1998. 9/101998 Royal Rumble MatchupVery predictable Royal Rumble in 1998, but also very fun to watch. 8/10WWF ChampionshipCasket Match""HBK"" Shawn Michaels (C) vs The UndertakerOne of the best matches in 1998. Very unpredictable and very good ending. 10/10WWF Royal Rumble 1998 is a tape every wrestling fan should own just for the fact of the Casket Match. It was unbelievable. 8/10"
4,A TRUE RUMBLE!,"It was the greatest way to start off 1999. Austin- McMahon rumble was alright, but the strap match was a classic. The I QUIT MATCH WAS GREAT! BECAUSE THE GREAT ONE WAS IN IT (NOT THE ROCK) MICK FOLEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The Royal Rumble was a solid event,"I was actually at the Royal Rumble on January 18, 1998, and I would like to say that it was a very solid event. I would recommend this to someone who wants to see the last match that Shawn Michaels faught at 100%. This is the match when he originally hurt his back. It was also cool to see Mick Foley come out as all three alter-egos. If you don't have King Of the Ring 98 though, I would recommend that over this though. But I think that this was the best PPV of 98 under KotR."
4,Royal RUMBLE 98 the show that changed it all,"Royal rumble an ok card at best changed wrestling history.It was the first showing of mike tyson,and it changed the ratings war from wcw to wwf.The shows good matches Rock vs shamrock,rumble and the coffin match were all good to.Recommended as a show for wwf fans to praise."
1,a bit dreary,"(or perhaps 1.5 stars...)the title track, present in two versions, is a wonderful pop song, as is 'supersonic' here in a superior live version. the other tracks are, however, largely disposable, especially the lumbering, lunkheaded E-A rocker, 'Cloudburst'."
