1,Not worth spending your time or money on,"This product was a big disappointment. It is difficult to hold, either wet or dry, and doesn't massage well at all. In the shower, the massager and brush attachments just pull on your skin. I would certainly recommend something else if you want a decent massager."
4,Great for Students and those refreshing their Spanish,"As a friend of the author I'm not totally unbiased, but looking at the work on its own merits, I am impressed. For me, as an Anglo with ties to the Hispanic community, I found Mr. Bencastro's eloquent description of the Hispanic identity crisis in America particularly enlightening. Besides that, it's a pretty good story. Lastly, as I read it, I couldn't help but wish that it had been around when I was learning Spanish. The books we had to read for late high school and early college courses were not nearly so easy to read and interesting. The language itself is simple and straightforard, but not dull. For the intermediate student it provides new vocabulary, a nice story and some thought provoking themes."
4,Great Book,"I love this book. It is organized by the main material needed. All the crafts can be done by both my 5 and 7 year old, and they love the end product. This book also offers other suggestions at the end of each set of craft directions for possible alternative crafts. This is not rocket science, it's just quick and dirty crafting for those kids who are bored and love making things. I'm so glad I got it before summer vacation. PS. If you have some craft supplies around your house on a normal basis,(paint, pipe cleaners, beads, foam, felt), you won't need to go buy a bunch of specialty items to complete these crafts."
2,For Petroski Fans Only,"This is a collection of articles written for Petrowski's monthly column in American Scientist magazine. Many are brief biographies of 19th-century engineers; a (very) few look (very) briefly at particular pieces of historical engineering (an article on the Ferris wheel is probably the best); others are ruminations on such hazards of the engineering practice as the stress that keeps them up at night and their failure to be awarded Nobel prizes. These seem quite satisfactory articles for a magazine column but they are slender stuff for a book. And Petroski's tendency to return to the same subjects, pardonable in a monthly column, becomes repetitive when the columns are collected. All but die-hard Petroski fans can skip this one"
4,A must for engineering fans,"Remaking the World should be sought out by any and all fans of engineering, laymen included. Anyone who has ever been mesmerized and enthralled by great feats of construction needs to take part in Petroski's stories behind these great feats. A thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable book."
3,Not just for engineers,"... but I'm getting a copy for my Dad the engineer. I enjoyed this despite my very soft background in the hard sciences: an English degree. Petroski sometimes leads you down a road with an abrupt ending, but most times it's a pleasant journey and he leads the reader around a few curves, too."
4,logistic and supportability issues,"In Remaking the World: Adventures in Engineering, Henry Petroski writes about many man-made wonders of the world. Most intersting to me was the discussion on the logistic and supportability issues surrounding the design and development of the Panama Canal. Great book!"
4,Basic & Simple information for the shopfloor.,"This book has basic & simple information regarding TPM for the shopfloor. It gives simplified vision of different pillars, with focus on Autonomous Maintenance."
3,TPM for Every Operator,The book was deliveredin good condition as advertised.This book will help orient staff on what to expect in a TPM environment.
3,"I love Billy Joel, but I could really do without this album.","Billy tries a doo-wop theme with this album, and it is clearly evident in more than 50% of the songs. My favorite song on here is probably the title track and ""Leave A Tender Moment Alone."" I have always been ticked off that Joel is probably best known for ""Uptown Girl,"" which is probably his worst song ever, honestly! I truly hope that this song isn't forever associated with Billy in music history. I understand what he was trying to do in re-creating a retro-50's theme, but to me it lacks his quality of songwriting and song variation that we see in the albums surrounding this one (Nylon Curtain & The Bridge). Sorry to upset some die hard fans here, but come on, if this album is in the top five of your Billy Joel collection, youv'e probably been ""Sleeping With The Television On"" for too long already!"
2,Shrill Remaster,"This is not one of favourite Bill Joel albums, But it does have some memorable stuff on it among the forgettable cuts. There is the emotional 'An Innocent man', 'Uptown Girl' and Tell her About It'. The remastering is shrill and tinny, with hardly any bass. this is a shame because all the other BJ albums up to and including 'The nyon Curtain' Were superbly remastered."
3,Nice Do-Wop Tones But Not Quite Prime Time,"This Billy Joel CD certainly has its good moments. Surprisingly I tend to prefer the less commercial tunes such as This Time, Easy Money, and Christy Lee. Uptown Girl is my fave among the singles. Love the steady drumming and of course the strong vocals.The other singles have a steady pattern which is OK now and than but a little repetitive on a regular basis. The title track is a bit too drawn out with a relatively weak hook around the I Am An Innocent Man part. Keepin' The Faith also lacks staying power. A more ellaborate bridge would have been helpful.Maybe its just me, I but lean to Billy Joel's less overplayed recordings such as Turnstiles, Streetlight Serenader, Cold Spring Harbor, and The Bridge. I also like the more ellaborate, The Stranger and the new wave oriented Glass Houses. This one rates somewhere in the middle of the road."
2,Billy's golden age comes to a... end,"Billy killed his golden age after the release of the overrated NYLON CURTAIN. He switched to writing lighthearted songs like the overplayed ""Uptown Girl"", and ""Tell Her About It"", as the basis of a new album to be released in 1985. Joel's songwriting fell victim to decay and his songs no longer were deep or intellectually involved. He would never again turn out any real original material, but only copies of already written songs. AN INNOCENT MAN was clearly evident of Billy's aging ability.Here, no indepth study is needed. ""An Innocent Man"" is one of the few songs worth listening to. ""Keeping the Faith"" is overrated, and ""Uptown Girl"" is overexposed.Hold off to buy this album until you buy GLASS HOUSES, THE STRANGER, TURNSTILES, or a greatest hits compilation first. Or buy it for collecter's sake"
5,"My personal favorite (yes even better than ""The Stranger!""","""An Innocent Man"" was that one album (cassette back then) that both my sister, my parents and myself could agree on to listen to in the car. Hence, I have internalized every nook and cranny of this masterpiece, which contains some of his most enduring songs. Though the musical styles might suggest these songs sound empty, there is some real depth here. The title track, ""The Longest Time,"" ""This Night,"" ""Leave a Tender.."" and ""Keeping the Faith"" are all uniformly strong songs, with the lyrics to the title track some of the most poignant he ever wrote. This album transports ME back to a time when I was a little more innocent (before my parents got divorced) and shows how uplifting music can be. Thank you Billy for this gift."
4,Bluesy Billy,"The outstanding cuts on this CD are the bluesy ""Easy Money"" & ""Christie Lee."" Buy this one for the blues and the humor. And if you like those traits here with a wellknown artist, don't overlook Amazon's offerings by Jim Byrnes - a crossover connection that Joel fans may miss since Byrnes is known better north of the US border."
4,A Very Good CD,"This is a very good, consistent CD. Of the 10 tracks, I've rated all but two of them as Very Good. Those other two are rated as an Excellent and as a (merely) Good (one each). My specific track ratings are:1. Easy Money -- 4 Stars2. Innocent Man -- 4 Stars3. Longest Time -- 5 Stars4. This Night -- 4 Stars5. Tell Her About It -- 4 Stars6. Uptown Girl -- 4 Stars7. Careless Talk -- 4 Stars8. Christie Lee -- 3 Stars9. Leave a Tender Moment Alone -- 4 Stars10. Keeping the Faith -- 4 Stars"
5,Billy is the best!!!!,I thoroughly enjoyed and continue to enjoy Innocent Man. Its a classic. Probably his best album from top to bottom
5,Gran CD,"¡Excelente!. Disco de los años 80, tiene éxitos como ""Uptown girl"", ""Keeping the faith"", ""The longest time"", ""Leave a tender moment alone"" y ""Tell her about it"". Dios los bendiga."
5,A Golden Oldie,"I was nostalgic for this album, which I loved when my children were small, and was delighted to see it on Amazon. It arrived very quickly in the mail in perfect condition."
5,Great Music,"This a wonderful album and truly is a tribute to Joel's predecessors in rock n' roll. A minor correction, however - the chorus from ""This Night"" is not from the ""Emperor Concerto"" (#5) but is from the second movement of the Sonata #8 in C-minor, Opus 13, the ""Pathetique."" The tunes are somewhat similar."
3,"Not basic enough, not thorough enough.","This is a somewhat strange introduction to the reading and interpretation of financial statements. The book is not basic enough for newcomers, yet it is not thorough enough for experienced people either.The main problems I have with this book are 1) the language is sometimes difficult to understand especially in the introductory chapters of the book, and 2) the book gives a lot of ""don'ts"" but not many ""do's"" - for instance regarding the measurement of cash flow, the author tells you all the wrong ways of doing it, but neglects to tell you the right way of measuring cash flow.I have given the book 3 stars because it does have some interesting parts. But if you're new to accounting I would instead recommend getting the book Financial Statements by Thomas Ittelson.PS: This review is for the Sixth Edition of the book."
2,Won't Help You Understand ENRON.,Concepts such as pro forma statements and restatement of earnings just aren't addessed in this 1999 book. Time for another update!
3,How to Read a Financial Report,"The book was received in excellent (new) condition. However, being that I am not really interested in the topic and only purchased this for a course, I can not rate the text."
3,Good overall introduction,This book presents the principles of basic managerial accounting and takes the insight just a little farther. The author's opinions and personal insights add a little extra to the content.
5,excelllent intro,"This book is excellent in the following ways :-succeeds in explaining in a concise (+- 100 pages) and clear way the basic principles of financial statements.-the special format of the book is excellent in that it shows most examples and related text without having to turn the pages.-there is enough white space, allowing you to make annotations.Strongly adviced for anybody owning a company or for management / accounting students."
3,A good simple reference book,"John A. Tracy was amazing in his ability to present fundamental accounting concepts in a concise and incisive manner.In addition, the book is well organised for ease of reference for non-accounting trained professional.This is a book that might intrigue non-accounting trained manager and equip them with basic knowledge to read a financial statement.For experienced professional, my advise is to skip most of the chapters and read the few pages on number massaging and window dressing, and some insights that John A. Tracy shared towards the end of the book. This should take less than 10 minutes and is well worth the time."
4,Excellent for first time user (FIRST time user),"This book is a good choice for someone who don't now anything about financial reports.I'm no expert but I'm more than novice. It didn't help me much. If you know already something, don't buy this book. But if this is your FIRST step reading financial reports, this is a great book."
4,"i like it, but not the still shots","Seems like everyone likes this small multy-user friendly camera.Everything jams in this camera. Small, digital with a Zeiss lens.An additional battery is helpful, but cost alot (see price.I've noticed a dink on the lcd, as if a pixel is cosntant dark blue. Its new- what happened.The still shots are weak (640px). I tried everything in photoshop, but its useless. Seems like the still shots are best outside in sunlight.I like the cam. regardless its my baby, I don't bother with the memory stick, instead I bought myself a canon S100 with additional 128 mb through Amazon for a very low price.Happy Holidays All."
2,silk?,"This doesn't have the appearance or feel of silk-more like bad polyester.Kinda like those cheap, cheesy sheets you see in department stores.This was a gift, albiet a joke valentines for my teenage son, and I did expect silk. However he does report that they are comfortable and fit well and he does like the boxer briefs anyway."
5,"Excellent intro to ""classical"" music","I would recommend this as an excellent introduction to classical music for those looking for an entry point. The pieces are familiar to most everyone, and are quite beautifully orchestrated. I have purchased better than 5 copies and given them as gifts to neophytes, with good results. I really love the ""Preludium in E Major,"" and ""Sleepers, Awake"" will melt anyone's heart. And you can't beat the price!"
4,"An ""audio daily double""","MF Doom's ""Operation: Doomsday"" is like that. He doesn't at all sound like the guy from KMD that I remember from ""Peach Fuzz"". He's the truth, this is a nice CD. It's definitely Hip Hop and the 80s samples(i.e. ""Shoot 'Em Up Movies) pulled at my heart. On the song, ""Hey!"" he uses the intro from Scooby Doo, that was fresh. Only in Hip Hop can we take something like that and make it def. ""Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo/that's an audio daily double/rappers need to fall off/just to save me the trouble, yo."" Well, MF Doom hasn't fallen off, if anything, he's stepped the game up with this project."
4,Doomilicious,"Not that I'm a rap connoisseur, but Operation: Doomsday has to be one of the best rap albums I've ever heard. It was just too GOOD! This isn't P.E. ""It Takes a Nation..."" good, but close enough. I recommend you sir, you madam, to run out to your local Amazon.com and order yourself a copy of Operation: Doomsday. The beats will hypnotize you. The slow, deliberate rhythms will make you groove in your sofa. MF Doom lets his music disassemble, then reassemble, disassemble again--HE'S CRAZY! MF Doom's ability to reinterpret Victor Von Doom as the modern day hustler is ""Fantastic"" Four. I can't listen to Operation: Doomsday without bobbing my head like Kit-Kat Wanda on E.34th street on a busy Sunday morning after all the nightclubs close."
5,WACK TRAFFIC RE-ISSUE,"I'm not gonna review the album,because we all know it's a classic,probably top 10 of all time,but this re-issue is so wack that I don't know where to start describing it.It look's like cheap bootleg.The ""booklet"" is just one page and it's white on inside,the cd is also cheap looking.This is not the original cd this is official bootleg.I am willing to invest money in my cd collection,what i've been doing for 18 years,but if this is what I get for my money,maybe I should start downloading.I know that original press was also low budget,but they can put little more effort in this.As far as I hear voices track goes that was bonus cut on 2001 version of this album on sub verse records.This track listing is from original pressing on fondle 'em, records from 1999.PEACE"
4,Pro'riginal,So many artists today can have their 'hits' recorded over with vocals of another and still be popular. No one can do it like DOOM. This is his most raw album. My favorite DOOM album of all.
5,doo doo doo doo doo thats the audio daily double............,"Simply put...this album was not what i expected....it transcended my expectations and in a day and a half i bumped it at least 6 times all the way through. Tracks 2 and 3 i have KILLED and the fantastic four samples were right on point....track 12 is tight with the scooby doo villain sample, his understated laid back rhyme style is nasty in its simplicity. He rarely gets excited on the mic and just spits....all the way through the album and thats rare nowadays. There is a skit on there where he is doing a burner of Doom and he's talking to a girl and i just thought it was tight because she was like ""thats you isn't it???"" and M.F. was like ""naw its not...i mean what gave you that idea"" it just made the album seem even more real. Buy it as soon as you canPeace"
5,Underground at it's best!!,"It's great to see that the artist formerly known as Zev Love X is back as MF Doom. I loved KMD. They were up and coming in the early 90's. Anyway, this LP is and should be a underground classic. With cuts like ""Rhymes Like Dimes"", ""Go with the Flow"", Tick, Tick w/MF Grimm, ""Hey!"" Operation: Greenbacks"", ""?""w/Kurious. And ""I Hear Voices"" One of my favorites. MF's lyrics are still sharp as ever with his clever metaphors and word play. This Lp is one of the best of 2001. If you love underground, gritty hip-hop, and you loved KMD. This LP is for you."
2,OK,"I didn't like it but I only decided to listened to it to see if MF Dooms an artist Id be interested in after listening to Madvillain, but it has way to much R&B for me."
1,SCAMMERS ! ! !,Let me simplify this for anyone whos reading this. Do not waste your money on buying this CD because the person(s) claiming to have this item for sale is conning people into believing that there actually selling this CD. What makes it worst is that you can probably ask around and im sure youll find someone with a decent copy. If your a doom fan and have already heard MMfood then you dont need to retreat because MMfood is by far the better album. Even Madvillainy is smaking it. Its a good album to have if your a fan but its definitly not worth putting yourself through the foolishness to buy it. If you really want it just download it. Trust me ! ! !
4,Great narrative on the later Vietnam wAr,"Historical accounts typically are less interesting then personal stories for me, but this one was an exception. The battle is described in great detail, unbiased with many perspectives. It really conveys the toll that politics took on the units on the ground as us ground troops were being scaled back. A clear contrast to the claims that we never lost a major engagement in the war."
5,Ripcord,"A nauseating account of the mindset of senior officers and the total waste of young men to achieve a grandiose if not utterly unobtainable objective. Reminds me of ""King of the Mountain"" that we all played as children but for real. I too am a RVN Veteran (67-68). Just throwing men into a meat grinder against a well armed, well equipped and highly motivated NVA with no discernible results except needless casualties. Ranks right up there with Dak To and Hamburger Hill."
1,DISAPPOINTING AND VERY SLOW MOVING!,"Mariel was too immature, the story was very slow moving. Antonio was 40 years old and Mariel was 18 years old. She acted her age, playing stupid little games i.e. incident in the cave and her reaction afterwards. I like the characters in my romance novels to have more substance and smarts. I like them to be real and not blow hot and cold all the time. I'm tired of Latino authors projecting Latinos as wishy, washy characters that don't know their own minds. I have read stories written by non-Latinos that have made the characters more assertive and given them more depth. I'm Latina and I had high hopes for this novel, but I was disappointed."
1,Not so soothing,"I bought this massager to work out some knots in my neck muscles after a weekend of gardening left me in pain. Unfortunately, the pulsing motion of the massager was about as soothing to sore muscles as a jackhammer pressed into the back of my skull. I found that the two other attachments looked a little different, but didn't really feel much different. I suppose that this massager might be a little more useful on other areas of the body that are less delicate, such as legs or lower back, but I think a different massager might offer a wider range of use."
5,Very effective,"I've tried every type of massager, roller, vibrator, etc. and this is the best for spasmmed muscles. If you want a feel good, relaxing experience look elsewhere. This is more of a therapeutic treatment for knotted muscles. An older lady had gotten this as a Christmas present. It was too painful for her so she gave it to me. What a life saver! My shoulder was in painful spasm as a result of a fall while downhill skiing. I was hardly able to raise my arm. One half hour sessions three days in a row and it was like new again. The other shoulder with the same problem a year before took many visits to a naturopathic doctor over a period of months to work it out. Now my back is in spasm and nothing is helping much. Today I remembered the Pollenex Tapper and found it finally under the couch. There is some discomfort, but it works. I have two other tapping massagers, this is the best. Too bad it's not available any more. Maybe on eBay?"
4,Unique voice and singing personality,"Luz has an outstanding voice. This CD has a lot of songs: all the essentials plus some tunes that are not that memorable. Anyway, since all the fantastic ones are there I think this CD is a must have. Great value for money."
4,Aftermarket Dryer Belt,"The belt fit as promised & the dryer is running again. My ""real"" job requires rotating shifts & it took more time to have the opportunity to install it than it took for shipping & installation combined!My darlin' & I are empty-nesters & both work on cookin', mowin', doin' the wash & such but, if Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy. I'm pleased to report that with the new dryer belt installed, she's happy again. She's so happy about it that I get to sleep indoors now. YAY!!! You might not think that this is important, but winter's a-comin' folks! YOU try sleepin' in the carport with the coons, coyotes, possums, displaced vampire bats & IRS agents that stop by for directions in the middle of the night then see how YOU like it!!! I am now, once again, the master of my destiny. Oh thank you, Amazon!!!"
5,It works!!!,"we all know how the world stops when your needed appliances stop working-my dryer did that. checking into the problem we discovered it was a broken belt. pricing the item at local stores and knowing the cost of labor we turned to amazon! the belt was a fraction of the cost at the stores and with fast delivery and free shipping,we went to work replacing it. it came with instructions and checking on the internet for diagrams, it took 30 minutes to replace. it did take two people to accomplish the job. you do not have to be a mechanic to do this job, but you probably should be someone that likes fixing things!!! i am pleased i saved money and the hassle on buying a new machine,low price to purchase the belt ,no labor costs- and best of all my dryer works!!!!"
3,"works ok, but not FSP","Maybe I am dumb, I was expecting this is a genuine FSP belt, but it turned out just another 3rd party made. Works fine so far though."
5,does what it says it does,"when i discovered my dryer was heating but the drum wasnt spinning, i initially thought it was gonna cost me a fortune to get an appliance repairman to the house. i determined it was a broken belt and watched some youtube videos on repairing it myself. Ordered one from these guys, it was in my mailbox on the 3rd business day and i had the dryer up and running in under an hour. quality."
5,very pleased,"After checking out the price of the belt locally, I thought I would check online. I couldn't believe how inexpensive it was, I purchased it on a Sunday and had my dryer running by the end of the week. Very pleased!"
3,Dryer Belt,"It is a dryer belt, the tumble dryer had given up, it arrived quickly, it was the right part, job done!"
5,Fits my KitchenAid Dryer,"Great price, great quality. Fit my KitchenAid Dryer (same as Whirlpool) perfectly. I'm very satisfied with the purchase- highly recommend."
5,Eclectic Asian Dance Groove Jazz Thing,This is a great album. It's accessible and intelligent dance music. I've seen these guys live and they really get the house going. Highly recommended as a sountrack to the urban landscape most of us live in.
2,Yikes,"Ok, so it's the thing to do in the ninties --get your name on a tribute album. I have yet to hear a tribute album that is well done. This one gets two stars ONLY for the fine acappella ""Driftin'"" by FBBoA, Los Lobos treatment of AYE, and Cassandra Wilson's soulful LW. For the life of me, I can't understand why mostly overrated artists have a need to regurgitate perfect tunes in their own style. Does someone really think a ten year old will buy this CD because Taylor Dayne or Chuck D is on it? Come on folks, only Hendrix fans will buy it and lame 90's interpretations will only make us mad."
1,GET OUT A HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CAN YOU SAY NOOOOOO STARS!,"I SAW THE LAST PERFORMANCE OF THE J.H.E. AT THE DENVER POP FESTIVAL IN 1969. JIMI'S TO ROCK MUSIC AS THE MASTERS ARE TO CLASSICAL. WHY IS THERE NO SAMPLER OF THIS FIASCO, AS JIMI ROLLS IN HIS GRAVE?! THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?!.........right? WHAT'S NEXT? JOE PESCHI SINGS JIMI!"
2,Total Dissappointment 2,"I had the exact same problem David Williams described below. If you have upgraded Flight Simulator 2004 from 9.0 to 9.1 this program will NOT load and your Flight Simulator 2004 will NOT work afterwards, even after uninstalling WWII Carrier Ops. Fortunately, I had WinXP and used System Restore to bring back Flight Simulator back to its former self. Stay away from this piece of garb if you have upgraded Flight Sim 2004 to version 9.1. Thanks for nothing Abacus, your product stinks and the only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it does look good with Flight Sim 2004 v.9.0"
1,Total disappointment,"I tried to install the sim. under Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 (ver 9.1),and was very disappointed that when I startedthe sim. error came as"" you have a version that does not matchthe version of the basic Flight simulator"".?!I sent the mfg. an email - but with no luck.The most painful issue is,that also the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 will not work.I had to remove it and install it again.!!!"
2,Where's the beef?,"The big question asked of Walter Mondale in his presidential campaign was simply, ""Where's the beef?"" In other words, you've given us an overview - when do you explain the long-term, nitty-gritty details of what you're talking about? He gives a few examples - big deal!! In the fundamentalist camp, which I belong to, the author's tactics amount to something called ""proof-texting"". Proof-texting is going through the Bible and carefully selecting only the verses which support your position. Like C.S. Lewis, I believe that you don't leave your brain at the altar. The author has NOT demonstrated that the positions (racist, sexist, etc.) are Dobson's reflexive positions. I think he was cherry-picking what Dobson has said. Why else would Dobson have so many black, Hispanic, and female supporters? (And don't give me any of that false consciousness trash because it won't wash!)"
4,For Jonestown completists/obsessives,"This short, difficult-to-find book was written ten years after the Jonestown tragedy by a journalist/private investigator. Some people would no doubt dismiss the book as more conspiracy theories without any basis. There are questions about Jonestown, Peoples Temple, and the deaths of November 18th, 1978, that at least to me have never been sufficiently answered. The discrepancies in the timeline of the Jonestown events, the number of bodies, the missing records, and even certain facts about Jim Jones' background are just some of the things this author discusses.I would recommend this book only to those who can't forget about Jonestown, and have read quite a few other books on the topic before this one."
5,"SUPER THICK, clean look, no smells, FUN","3/4"" is different from those 3/8"" or 9/16"" mats who also claim to be ""extra thick"".They keep the little ones safe, and warm (we use them on our basement floor, it always feels dry and warm on the mats)Forget about the shapes/numbers/alphabets mats. You will find yourself organizing/doing puzzles all the time instead of enjoying them. There are tons of other ways to educate your kids so save your back.They look super clean and are easy to clean too.Last but not least, they have no plastic smell at all. When we got ours (we bought 5 sets at two times) the plastic wrap did have a little smell but the mats didn't.Fun: yes, fun. My boys sometimes use them to make houses and tunnels. The pieces are big so kids can really play in the houses and tunnels.We have enjoyed ours for over 5 years (bought 2006 and 2007). They are all in good shape.Now"
4,more than a floor cushion,"My son's private daycare uses these mats to build tunnels and houses. Most days that I come pick him up there is ""newconstruction"" setup in the other room and my son is dragging me over to check it out. I am on the verge of buying these mats for a Christmas present for my son (6) and daughter (2) and their cousins just for the purpose of building tunnels and houses. It's a more stable alternative to couch cusion forts (no more rebuilding every two minutes 'cause the walls caved in again!)."
2,Not soft enough for newborn-12 months.,"My daughter is 7 months old and recently became very active (crawling, sitting on her own, falling over, etc...) so I bought these playmats to give her some cushion (we have all hardwood floors). While these are well made and appear to be fantastic for older children, I feel they are not soft enough for babies ages newborn to 12 months. For example, when she gets excited while playing on her back, she'll kick her feet against the mats...and I can see by the expression on her face it hurts her heels. I've also noticed that when she's sitting and falls over, her falls seem to hurt. I ended up ordering a new and much softer, thicker mat for her until she's a bit older. It definitely has made a difference."
5,I love these mats!,"I bought 2 sets for my boy's (ages 5&3) room...I love them,I use them instead of a rug on their hard wood floor.I've not had a problem with slipping...they make a great safe play area for little rough and tumble boys! Great purchase!"
5,Playmats for Preschool,I ordered these mats for an indoor playroom at the preschool where I work. They work great to cushion any falls and protect the floor. The mats also lock together easily!
2,Sufficient Quality,"I'm a little disappointed in the quality of these mats. While they were great while my son was first learning how to sit on his own, they are not as durable as I expected them to be. These mats are easily scratched and scuffed (even by my sons soft finger nails!) My son is turning 8 months soon and while we have only had these mats for a few months, they already look like they have been through the ringer. We have them on top of hardwood floors and they slide easily which can be a safety hazard. I definitely recommend putting a grip mat underneath for hardwood floors. We didn't have any issue with him chewing on the edges and it has been great for cushioning his small falls. When it comes time to replace these ones, I do believe I will go with different brand with more durable, better quality."
4,oily residue,"Very sturdy and thick mats so even an adult can sit or stand on it and it won't dent. I have hardwood floors so I needed something for my baby to play on. It does have a oily residue on these mats so I do recommend putting it on a rug pad so it doesn't slide or leave that oil on the floors. I thought it would be easy to wipe off with floor cleaner (Bona) but that oil is still there and it is very slick if you are wearing socks and you walk across it so be careful! Might need to use soap to clean it off. Also, I do recommend to put a blanket down over it because I don't want that oil on my baby's face when she face plants on it while doing tummy time."
4,Classroom use,"My students find the foam tiles to be very comfortable. My only gripe is that the tiles do not grip the floor. If you are covering a small area then the ""tile island"" will definitly slide across the floor. This is distracting to the students and can lead to a fall."
5,Step 2 foam mats are a plus!!!,I purchased these mats for my grandson for outside in the yard. I purchases three packs (12 in all). We set up a play area for him and put the plastic fense around it to form a circle. He is one year old this provides a safe haven for him. It cushions his fall because of the foam content. They are washable and durable. I only wish that the manufactures would label them so that you know which ones go into which. I labeled them myself with a permanent marker so that when I take them down to put away - the next time I need them it is easy to assemble. I also use them under his water/sand table.
2,They don't fit together....,We bought 4 sets of these and cannot get them to fit together without gaps... I would be super excited about these if they fit together... They are a great width for outdoors...our plan was to put this under a new playground our son is getting for his first birthday but now afraid that you can trip on the gaps.
1,"Step 2 24"" playmats","If you plan to use these playmats on HARDWOOD, do not buy them. They leave a very slippery film on your hardwood floor, not only under the mat, but also on the surrounding area. We have had these mats for 3 days and now the entire family has to wear shoes in the house because the slipperiness is spreading. My 2 year old fell four times already and my 8 month old is slipping and sliding all over the place as he crawls. I am extremely disappointed in these mats. AWFUL product. Absolutely AWFUL."
2,Both good and bad...,"I bought 8 sets of these mats to completely cover my son's playroom. Of the 8, there were 6 perfect sets. The other 2 had VERY rough sections that caused major irritation on my son's knees. When I contacted the company, they gave me a VERY hard time about the issue and basically said they wouldnt do anything about replacing those mats until they received them back and could do an investigation as to how this could have happened. They kept saying that they had never seen anything like this before as though I was making the issue up. In the end, I was SO unhappy with their attitude that I returned all 8 sets and went with another brand. Be careful and check the quality of the sets that you receive!!"
3,"Good mat, too small however","the mat is nice and thick, but it doesn't cover as much ground as I hope for."
3,Question???,"I need to know How many come in a set...Why no shipping to Puerto Rico...I have a dozen on My Day Care but I need to buy more...they are out of stock on the store, here in San Juan"
1,Shiiping Obstacle,"I would have loved to purchase this item, but I am not willing to pay 18.00 additional to receive three playmat packs."
1,Question about the Mats,How many come in a set??? It doesn't say anywhere and I need to know if I should order more than one set!?!?
3,Thickness is NOT as advertised,"The product description says these are 0.8"" (4/5"") thick, but the mats are actually only 0.625"" (5/8"") thick. The benefit of the doubt is that this is a shipping thickness (thickness including thin plastic packaging). So we are slightly disappointed in not getting the thickness we thought we were getting."
2,Brushfires or Trash Can Fires? You be the judge.,"This movie was simply odd but like a train wreck, although you want to stop watching you just can't. You never really know what is going on with each character and there is never any resolution between them. The movie ends with the watcher wondering ""what the heck did I just spend two hours of my life watching?""!"
4,Prefontaine,I saw Prefontaine and I think it is a wonderful movie about a colliget track star that never would realize his goal due to him being cut down far to soon.
5,Pre Pre Pre Pre,"Great inspirational movie. I was very surprised that my 16 YO son also liked it. Really good movie for anyone with children that participate in sports. A pleasure for adults too as it is an excellent story about how with focus, discipline and perserverance, you CAN reach your goals."
3,"OK, but not great.","This movie, unlike Without Limits was not filmed in Eugene, Oregon. Part of this one was filmed in Seattle, other parts, in other cities. This movie also had some parts that are not accurate when it comes to the races as another reviewer pointed out. However, Jared Leto is very good in this movie, and plays Pre very well. If you want the best Pre movie out there, get Without Limits, but if you already have that, get this one."
4,Pre-meet psyche-up movie!,"While reading many of the other reviews posted, I understood where a few complaints were coming from. I also read the book PRE, and it does mention that his friends did not call him Pre until college. Also, the actual race footage (running in the outside lanes, and finishing close together) would not have occurred. But one must look beyond these impurities, and realize it is the story of one of the most inspirational American runners. I recommend watching this movie before any important event."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","As a runner, I wanted to love this movie. Unfortunately, it has the lowest production values I've ever seen in a supposedly big-ticket movie. The ""aged"" character interviews are almost laughable and single-handedly made me hate it.All is not lost, though. The similarly themed movie ""Without Limits"" that was released almost alongside ""Pre"" is head and shoulders above this one. Buy that one instead and you'll be more than happy."
5,This movie has an impact on everyone not just runners.,Although i'm too young to have ever seen Pre in action i'm glad to say he is still my role model. I first saw the movie Prefontaine last month and it motivated me enough to take up running again. I run 7 days a week and hope to make the 2004 olympics. I recomend this movie to anyone not just runners. Go Pre!!!
5,A movie for all cross country teams to watch together.,"I thought that the director of ""Prefontaine"" did an excellant job of making this movie. This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. ""Prefontaine"" shows how if you work hard enough, you can achieve anything."
2,Watch Without Limits Instead,"This movie is nothing like the Without Limits. If you want a real movie about Prefontaine with great racing scenes, good characterizations, and Donald Sutherland as Bill Bowerman who can resist that check out Without Limits. Not to mention the actor who plays Lasse Viren actually looks like him not like the 3rd rate actor ""Prefontaine"" had. When it comes to Prefontaine bio Without Limits is the best bet."
2,prefontain,"i think the advertisment led me to believe that this film would be more of a documentary.as a typical ""hollywood job"" it was o.k. BUT i would find it difficult to be FAIR since i had a precnceived wish for it's content. tks vito"
5,"This movie got me running, I am so glad I saw it.","This is the greatest running film I have ever seen. It Far surpasses such films as ""Withought Limits"" and ""The Lonleyness of the Long Distance Runner"" which is now considered a clasic. Prefontaine got me up and running. I will be forever in debt to this film and it will aloways have a very special place in my heart. I am so glad that I have seen this all inspirig true tale of an underdog that defies all odds and sets his own standard for excelence. I watch this film at least 2 times a week."
5,Perfect!,"So glad to find this ""old"" movie, that I can't imagine finding anywhere else! I love Amazon.com!"
3,get the other one.,"its great cause its a movie about running; which is hard to find even in this DAY AND AGE.....BUT if I were stranded on a desert island, with a TV and the capability of watching only one movie and I wanted it to be about PREFONTAINE, I would definitely choose ""WITHOUT LIMITS"" over this....But if i could watch two movies,,,the other would be that one about making boats out of fruit."
1,I don't know how anyone can like this movie,"I've read most of the 5 star reviews and they just baffle me. This movie doesn't even compare to the other movie on Steve Prefontaine, Without Limits. The acting is very poor, the writing is horrible, and the production values are atrocious. It is also much much less factually actuate than Without Limts (for specific reasons why read the the 1 star review, A Customer). People who say that Jared Leto resembles Pre live in a reality that I'll never know. He looks and acts nothing like Pre. Again not even comparable to the job the Billy Crudup did in Without Limits. And there is nothing in this film resembling the relationship between Nike co-founder and legendary running coach Bill Bowerman, portrayed by the brilliant Donald Sutherland, and Pre as there is in Without Limits.In short this film is a cheesy poorly acted melodrama, and it boggles my mind how anybody could think that this film was better than Without Limits, or even a decent film on it's own."
5,And the dreams that you dare to dream may once come true,"This collection contains her greatest hits. She is a singer who moved many people so deeply. It began with the innocence and longing of youth, and came down to dramatic performances in which she seemed to be singing for her own survival.In any case she was one of the true greats of American song. And to hear her again is simply great pleasure."
4,Brace yourself,"The left and right wrist splints are of top quality US made and of good price. I suggest that that customer order, if available, a size larger than normal. The large size that I ordered was a bit too tight. I needed to go the full length of the velcro straps to avoid my thumb falling asleep/become numb."
1,bad,"This company has been advertising Windows XP for this gmae for over a year and it has still not come out with it, my daughter does not have a playstation or an x-box and was excited to hear it was coming out for the computer. Well, I had to disappoint her when I had to tell her they still haven't made it available, which they probably won't. This company should not advertise it until it is ready to be released. Obviuously they do not have kids to disappoint."
3,"Good explanations, but ....","This book explains the business plan in sufficient detail to let you understand what is needed to create a business plan. If you're not proficient already in writing business plans, you'll need a Ernst & Young consultant to have any use of the book. Of course, then you'll probably get the book for free ater having paid their fees. In short, nice to read but absolutely not the first bookon the subject to recommend to anyone."
5,Excellent guide,"The book includes all the necessary information about business plans, refers to the specific example and different aspects of start-up and existing business."
4,Excellent book for both Entrepreneurs and Investors,"This book on Business Plan is a very good reference to both; the entrepreneur, who wants to start a business and for the investors. It helps both the parties; the entrepreneur - how to draft a convincing business plan to convince the investors for funding (if required) and to the investor - what to expect and what to assert on, if they were to fund this venture.The book is useful for a startup, middle sized company and a large sized company and gives an idea how to organize each section to grow the organization. It describes how the Business Plan can be used every year, even for a growth with calculated risks. It describes how the Risks are highlighted to put the policies and decisions to either avoid, accept or mitigate those risks. The language in the book is very lucid. Some sections may have some extra text which make it a little long reading."
4,"Quick read, yet detailed.","If you're looking for something more than ""Business Plans for Dummies"" but don't need a textbook this is the book for you. Reads quickly, gives some pertinent details. A sample plan is used to illustrate components and the author comments on its strong and weak points."
5,Very expensive but necessary and very comfortable,The headline says it all. I have a Morton's neuroma on my left foot and using this orthodic makes me not even awared of it.
5,"Terrifying, Innovative and humorous - got to love that Jane!",I think this is my favorite of the Jane Whitfield novels. I literally could not put this one down. Thomas Perry Rocks!
4,Blood Money,"Thomas Perry's Jane Whitefield series is wonderful. I have read several of the books, not in any particular order, and they never disappoint. They're filled with action and yet a lot of sensitivity and humanity from the main character. Plus, it's a chick doing all the heroics! :) I highly recommend these to anyone."
4,Imaginative story overcomes flaws,"Thomas Perry is a very imaginative writer. The character, indeed the whole concept of a guide who helps people hide is unique and therefore interesting to one who spends a lot of time reading suspense and mystery novels. My only complaint is that Jane is too good - the reader never doubts that she will get out of any jam, so the suspense is somewhat deflated. But the writing and the story more than make up for this.As far as the presentation of the Mafia as a powerful, efficient machine, well, just suspend your disbelief and you'll do fine. It's certainly more interesting than the myth of the invincible US military we are subjected to in countless boring novels.I'm looking for more Thomas Perry right now..."
2,Blood Money,"I have read all of Thomas Perry's book going back to butcher boy, and thoroughly enjoyed them. However this latest edition of Jane Whtifield gets caught up in too many Italian names. Translate, Mafiosos, and the premise that Jane would wander off from her new life on such a weak case is not believable. It is time to retire Jane and invent a new character, or bring back butcher boy."
2,Slow moving and dull,"Maybe my expectations were too high after reading all the good reviews, but this book just didn't excite me at all. I kept trying to get into it, but by the end I was speed reading just to find out what happened at the end (not much). It is unfortunate, because Perry seems like he is probably a good writer, but the story lacks any real suspense, tension, or excitement. It is also very unbelievable, from the inital fact that Bernie ""the elephant"" has the location of billions in mob money stored only in his head (come on- it's the 90's), and when the money is given away to charities, they not only catch on instantly, but they then launch a nationwide net to catch Jane that would put the FBI to shame. Even the action scenes were slow paced and uninspiring. Perhaps his other books are better, because as I said, I think he could be a decent writer with a different story."
5,Oh to be Jane,I have read all the books in the series and this is my second favorite. The first of course was my all time favorite.Thomas Perry is brilliant. I would love to see Jane in the movies. I can't get enough of her.You will love it.Jane is a heroine a girl can be proud of. Shes tough without being callous and I love that he shows her spiritual side.
4,Interesting,"This is my first Thomas Perry novel and I really enjoyed it, but to think that the mob would trust one man, or one man's memory, to control all of their money is stretching it a little too much. I would like to read all of the prior Jane Whitefield novels to get to know her a little more (why she does this, where she and her husband met, etc.). Near the end, I just wanted the book to end - the last leg of their trip seemed to go on forever. I will read more of Thomas Perry's books."
3,No News...,"Any Jane Whitefield is better than most anyone else, yet this series has become predictable and Blood Money breaks no new ground. The conclusion winds down without suspense or surprise, and the plot itself paints far too much contrast between the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"". Author Perry needs a new challenge the next time out!"
2,So where's the mystery?,"Blood Money is filled with two-dimensional characters and a money laundering scheme that consumes chapter after chapter with needless detail. All of this at the expense of plot and character. And native Americans can't be too happy with Perry's minimal attempts to portray Jane as a tribal person. Perry throws this in at the beginning, but - like the runners she helps - Jane quickly disappears from the rez."
1,Overated,Having a quite dissaponting experience with other guides i looked to this one with hopes. Unfortunately it wasnt as good as i hoped. Having in mind that it is the Year 2000 this book is out of date and should be viewed as an alternative when all else fails.
1,thoroughly disappointing,"Stuart Harris has, in my opinion completely failed in trying to write a book that irc newbies can learn from.When i first ordered the book, I was hoping that it would enligten me about the many things i've since seen on irc, and that I still can't make sense out of by reading Stuart Harris' book.Additionally, i detected a definite anti-American attitude on his part.All-in All, if you are a newbie to irc, you would do much better to get a different book on irc, as this title, by stuart harris, is to my mind, thoroughly unintelligible."
3,I miss the REAL This Providence,"Because they left Rocketstar records, which was the best label for the best type of music genre, they went to Fueled By Ramen, which also labels Panic! At The Disco. Just because This Providence is in the same record label as Panic! At The Disco doesn't mean they have to sound like them. I'm not a fan of Panic's! genre of music. I liked the indie and emo approach to music. Now it's all gone. So now I'll stick to Copeland."
5,Orion Pluck-Foam Accessory Case,"I have a lot of lenses for my various cameras and wanted a nice, sturdy case to store them all in one place. Well, this certainly fits the bill! Excellent construction, well built and solid. The pluck foam is great, allowing you to customize the spaces for your specific lenses. I had no plans for traveling with the case, but if I were to do so, I think this case would give adequate protection to my lenses. I haven't measured it directly, but it seems to be small enough to use as a carry-on, although its somewhat heavy, given its solid construction. Overall, I'm quite pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone without reservations."
5,A TRULY AMAZING TREASURE OF A BOOK!,"If you can get your hands on this delightful book, it will not disappoint! It is one of the sweetest children's books ever written and it had my children completely engaged. Elizabeth Gordon has done it once again! All of her books are fantastic and a definite must for every family's library of classics!"
1,Waste of $$$,"This is a badly written book due to the attempt of using Ivy League elucidations for topics that should be told straightforward in terms of simple language. It also doesn't help to use end-of-the-book topics as examples or part of discussions in the early part of the book. In the end, this book causes more damage and confusion for someone attempting to learn the basic concepts of accounting for the first time."
2,Pretty bad,"Antle, being caught up in his own Yale-educated thesaurus, fails to explicitly reiterate Financial topics that may be lost to less familiar students. Fortunately, I had another book on the same topic that served as a mentor through a horrid and fast paced class on said suibject, while this one failed miserably. It also is missing certain topics that other books cover."
3,"Good reference, but info is dated","This book has tons of good info on tried and true historical standards in networking, but its material is getting dated at this point and could use a serious revision. Covers subjects such as Token Ring and FDDI as if they are as relevant as Ethernet today. Hits on SONET, T-Carrier and ATM, but developments in Integrated Services, Diff-Serv, and MPLS are beyond its issue date."
4,"bad book, but no other choice","Actually, this is very bad book. There are many errors and the author doesn't seem have much knowlege about civil engineering.But, you have no choice and this book is very helpful in real exam. You can find some very similiar problems in this book for your real exam. At this time, you can get your point for that question very easily.Conclusion.Do not buy new one. Buy used, old version, without cover..."
2,Sad effort,"One of the worst graphic novels I have ever read. The first story, about Tomorrow Woman, is the tired old cliche of robot becoming human. Poor Asimov is rolling over. The middle story about angels is well nigh unintelligble. There are entire frames that seem to be from some other story. The last piece about The Key is okay but half the story is the villain posing about and telling you what his plan is as opposed to allowing it to be expressed through the story. Sad writing really makes this book bomb."
3,"Fair, but it's because of DC's direction in this era","The stories in this volume are about as good as you could get with this era's DC heroes. DC had some goofy stuff going on then. Superman no longer had a mullet, now he was electric blue and looked ridiculous. Green Lantern was a manga fan who made goofy rock-em sock-em robots with his ring. Speedy was Green Arrow, and so much more. That I don't blame on JLA, that's what DC was up to with these previously iconic characters.So, take a bunch of characters that were being seriously screwed up and put them in a pretty decent couple of story lines and that is what you have here. If you're a JLA fan and need this to complete your set, then buy it. If you are wanting to dabble into some good DC stories... well... there are a lot better ones than this to do it with."
4,Cool comic...,"This isn't my favorite Grant Morrison JLA collection, (check out World War III, Earth-2, and JLA One Million for the best) but there's a lot in here I enjoyed. There's an excellent stand-alone story at the beginning, and I love what Morrison does with Zaurial and the young Green Arrow. Entertaining read, as usual. And yeah, Superman is blue, but you don't have to know anything about that story to enjoy this collection."
1,No corresponde a lo que indica el título del CD.,"Aunque hay temas grabados en estudio, el nombre de 20 éxitos originales remasterizados no aplica, ya que hay varios temas que son en vivo y no corresponden a las versiones originales (los más populares). Si a alguien le gustan las presentaciones en vivo puede ser una adquisición interesante, lamentablemente en mi caso estaba buscando las versiones originales como indicaba el título del CD."
1,"Wonderful, until it stops working.","All of the features, MP3 player, video player, snapshot viewer, and flash drive worked as described. After about 3 months of gentle use, I can no longer connect via the USB interface, which means I cannot change my songs, videos, snapshots, nor can I use the device as a flash drive.Visual Land does not respond to email requests for support.Buyer beware."
1,video does not work,You have to use Visual Land's conversion software to Visual Land's format to play videos. I could not get the conversion software to work. They will not answer my E mails. I asked them to help to fix the problem or I would like to return the unit.They will not answer my E mail.Do not by this player thinking you can play downloaded videos from sources such as I tunes. It will not work. Disapointing as it is advertised as an MP4 player. I can not reccommend this player.
5,It's about time,"I was beginning to think that poetry actually was dead until I read ""White Stucco,"" etc. by Karen Kevorkian. I read a lot of poetry, and most of it these days is written by people with more publishing connections than talent. Ms. Kevorkian has talent. The poems are very deep, and because of this, they can be savored, chewed, and rolled back and forth over your tongue until you absorb them. Her insights into (I don't know how else to say it) life, are so penetrating and detailed, you feel like you're living life through her experience. Then you close the book, and can step back and reflect. This woman would be deadly at a political ralley, and I think she's brilliant."
2,Slightly disappointed,"We bought this as a Halloween costume for our daughter. The jacket and pants were fine. Not the greatest quality but perfectly acceptable for an outfit that would only be worn once, maybe twice. The disappointment was in the hat. It is basically two pieces of cardboard with fake fur glued on. Again, I wasn't expecting the highest quality, but the hat was uncomfortable enough that our daughter wore it for about 2 minutes before refusing to have it on her head for the rest of the day."
3,Not!!,"This was not the toy we expected, or that was described. Size was much smaller and was led to believe the screen moved on his stomach!! It was still a fun toy, even though it was a bit disappointing!!!"
5,This is the best Teletubby I have ever owned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this Teletubby for my 10th birthday, and I love all the cute things he says! He is purple, and I know how to turn him on and off!!!!!!! He is the cutest ever!!!!!!! My parents wake up by listening to ""Pinkle winkle Tinky Winky"", ""Eh-oh!"", and ""Thank you!"""
5,Surprisingly good!,"I picked this up because I've been looking for a toothpaste that doesn't come in a plastic tube. I wasn't expecting much, but I really like it! It leaves my teeth and mouth feeling fresh and clean, and tastes pretty decent. So far my dentist can't tell the difference."
3,"Great idea, but falls in baby's face all the time","I loved the idea of this one and it does keep the baby warm, but it should be cut differently so that it doesn't fall in baby's face (or pokes in the eye). If I were buying again, I would buy a different one that doesn't zip up the front or has some accomodation for the baby's face."
5,A Must-Have Item,"This is the easiest and most convenient carrier cover I've found. Others have to be taken off to place the child in and take them out. Others don't cover the child completely and I found I needed to use an additional blanket to protect them. With this cover I no longer needed the extra blanket OR a snowsuit. When going in and out of stores, I never had to worry about my son's getting too hot, or too cold. I've convinced other women I work with to buy one for their carriers as well."
5,Essential for cold weather babies!,"Though I have seen many of the plaid baby seat cover ups in use, when I went to search for it this one caught my eye instead because one reviewer commented how this did not limit the face hole to a specific location. Very true! It made taking my baby everywhere so much easier. I was able to dress my baby in regular clothes & put him in the car seat easily. The hood protected him well against snow & wind. It was one of the best things we bought, and was reasonably priced!"
5,Great Cover,"I love the Wrap-N-Ride. I haven't used it with my baby since he isn't due until the end of Feb. I can't wait to use it though. I did have a little trouble fitting it on my Graco Snugride infant seat, I found I had to unthread the strap to get the straps through the slots, but only a minor inconvenience. I wouldn't have a problem if my infant seat was a 5 point harness, but it's only a 3 point (2 year old model.) I hated having to bundle my older son in a bunting then try to buckle him in the seat when he was an infant. I already know this will be so much easier with having to bundle a toddler. Now I'll only have to bundle my oldest, and just put a hat and booties on his younger brother. And on super cold days if we have to go anywhere, I'll just put a light blanket or a light jacket on him. I even found that I could still use the infant head support with the Wrap-N-Ride."
4,Between the Baby and the Car Seat,"With my first daughter I was as paranoid as anyone else. I was also told by certified car-seat installers that there should not be anything but a light jacket between my child and her car seat. Eventually, you stop listening to absolutely everything people tell you. NOBODY I know takes a 2 year old out of their winter coat to put them in their car seat. I've used this item and I think it's great. You have to use your own common sense when you listen to what the professionals say. In my opinion, there is NOT too much padding on this item. I certainly wouldn't let those comments prevent you from buying it."
2,Impossible zipper/not safe,"This product is very soft, I give it 2 stars for that.However, once I washed it, the zipper was nearly impossible to move. I have to tug and pull and maneuver the zipper over the teeth inch by inch to get it closed, while holding the 2 sides of the zipper together.Also, what's the deal with the flap? It falls down over the baby's face.Several certified carseat installers have said never to put anything between baby and the carseat. This product does go under the baby, so I will be exchanging it for Eddie Bauer cover by Gold Inc. that goes over the carseat and also has an outside pocket for storage."
1,Doesn't stay open... even when unzipped,"I bought this item for my 3-month old daughter. I took her out in it once and it was awful. If the hood is snapped on (a zipper would work much better here, or better yet, make it all one piece), it kept flapping over my daughter's head. And when we unzipped the body section while in the car, the two sides kept closing over my daughter's face. I couldn't find a good way to keep her ventilated and keep her face exposed so she could see and breathe. I returned this item immediately and bought a Bundle Me intstead."
4,Better than vinyl,"This review is for the SACD release only. So much of the 1980s hits are best remembered as heard on the radio, or at best, in CD quality at the supermarket, etc. So I can understand why they would put out a single layer SACD of Cyndi Lauper for die hard fans. It's single layer because you already own the CD. An SACD format is required to get those shrill notes, squeaks and screams. Surprisingly, even some of the synth work benefits from super-sonic playback. I find my ear drums quake from the keyboard at the start of ""All Through the Night""."
2,Hardly any improvement to justify SACD price,"Putting the material aside, this disc is a dissapointment. If it had that ""analogue"" sound that just blows me away on many other SACD releases which were done better and in 5.1, (i.e. ""Brothers in Arms"" by Dire Straits), I'd find myself reaching for it 'time after time' for many hours of musical bliss. The singer does not come into my listening room but remains shrouded behind a digital realm. Alas, it is just ok and with not enough discernable improvement over a regular cd, especially considering the price, so it will likely spend it's life on a shelf undisturbed but for the occasional dusting. Recommended only if the artist is special to you."
5,An essential,"One of the greatest female artist albums of all time, in the pop/rock genre. I have never tired of listening occasionally. (The haunting ""Time After Time"" is one of my favorite tunes of all time).Nicely remastered and there are 3 bonus tracks of live performances of songs that are on the original album playlist: ""Money Changes Everything"", ""She Bop"", and ""All Through The Night"". I prefer the studio versions, but they are on there too. If you are not familiar with this album, I'll just say that there's something there for everyone. Not much ""filler"" here.The original recording quality was exceptionally strong in my opinion, and I'm not quite sure if this reissue is of that level. But it seems to be quite good and this is certainly a 5 star product.Recommended."
5,A Classic Masterpeice,"I just love everything about Cyndi Lauper.Her music takes me back to my teen years.Especially this album filled with such memorable rock songs.I remember seeing the video for Time After Time,and I cried my eyes out.Girls Just Want To Have Fun seems to be everyone's favourite.Cyndi is so colourful that all her colour seems to spread all over everything she does.I loved her video for She Bop.Another favourite of mine is All Through The Night.There's something special about the sound of that song.Definetly one of the best albums from the 80s."
1,Watch out for SACD!!!!!!,This CD is SACD which means it only plays on a specific type of Sony CD player. Avoid these CDs since they won't play on any other CD player.
4,Looked for this for years!,"Cyndi Lauper Live in Paris --- I have a tatty old VHS tape that I made from the original 1987 HBO concert. It has moved with me, and I have treasured it. I have been looking for this concert on DVD for years. So, here it turns up on Amazon, from a Marketplace vendor, from BRAZIL of all places, with the graphics in Portugese. Another reviewer is right, the video quality isn't great. It looks like it wasn't made from a master tape --- BUT, I was prepared for that. Just the ability to have this wonderful concert in a non-deteriorating DVD is important to me. These live versions are all my favorites, especially ""All Through the Night"" and ""Time After Time."" The HBO version was shorter, about an hour. If you are looking for a really sharp picture, you won't find that here. But the sound is fine. And it is probably better than my old VHS tape, by now. All of my TVs are digital now, so my VHS player doesn't even work with them. Overall, very pleased to have found this on DVD!!!!"
4,Awesome,"I like this CD and I like the fact that it has extra tracks that are not on our old cassette tape, the live versions of her big hits are awesome."
2,I love the original...,"Alas the SACD reissue is aweful. Apparently the engineer who worked on this reissue must not have cared for Cyndi's voice because it is mixed way too low in comparison to the instruments. I consider ""Time After Time"" to be one of the ten best pop tunes of the 80's. Listening to the muffled and often difficult to hear vocal track on the SACD version was enough to make me feel like I'd wasted my money and things don't get much better then that on the rest of this disk.Hopefully there will be a SACD release of this album some day that does it justice. For now, just say no and stick with the standard edition."
4,Just fun !!,"A fun and friendly album, resisted the passing of time. A pleasure to hear it once again. Here are many classic pop songs and also you can enjoy the really great voice of Cyndi in tracks like Miles Davis's favourite ""Time after Time"""
4,Good songwriting underneath that 80's sound,"80's popmusic often bothers me with it's clanky hollow drums and overall superficial sound of computers. She's Unusual is not that much different but what sets it's apart from other similar albums from that age is the excellent songwriting by Lauper and other's whose songs ended up on this CD. OK, Opening track Money Changes Everything could easily have been on a Springsteen album but the song is still good. Most known are of course the superhits Girls Just Wanna Have Fun (with lyrics that deserve more attention since it is not all about just having fun) and Time After Time. Prince's When You Were Mine is another example of great songwriting. So underneath the often clanky sound sits a well written record."
4,Cyndi's Debut Still Tops!,"In 1984, She's So Unusual came right out of the blue to stun people with its vitality, exuberance, optimism and general wackiness.It's was a very popular record in my school as one hit after another such as Girls Just Wanna Have Fun and Time After Time sprung forth.If you want to relive your youth, this reissue is worth considering. Never before seen pictures of Cyndi, new liner notes and three live bonus tracks such as She Bop, All Through The Night and Money Changes Everything makes you wanna have fun again!"
5,80's music,"this is full of the good stuff. some of the great songs are. witness, she bop, yeah yeah. and many others."
5,SHE'S SO Unusual,"I DO NOT HAVE THE CD BUT I DO HAVE THE AUTIO CASSETT OFCYNDI LAUPER AND I DO LOVE HER MUSIC AND TONIGHTCYNDI LAUPER IS ON LIFE TIME INTIMATE PORTRAIT AND IAM AMAZED THAT SHE IS SO GOOD IN HER SINGING CAREERAND I WONDER HOW TALENTED OF BEING A PROFESIONAL SINGER.YOUR FRIEND,REBECCA DERANEK THIS MY OPIOIN ON THE SUBJECT."
4,"The more I play it, the more I like it!","I read about Lisa somewhere, and decided to order this album. I have to say, the more I play it, the more I like it. Her lyrics are well crafted, and the melodies and instruments fit the mood of those lyrics so well, like Joni Mitchell's music and lyrics do as well. Lisa's voice reminds me of Lori Carson, Leah Andreone and even Susan Voelz. Musically, she also reminds me of Lori, and even Happy Rhodes at points! Great purchase!"
3,Quite OK!,"A few years ago I read about Lisa somewhere, and decided to order this album. I have to say, it's a quite OK album. Her lyrics are well crafted, and the melodies and instruments fit the mood of those lyrics so well, like Joni Mitchell's music and lyrics do as well. Lisa's voice reminds me of Lori Carson, Leah Andreone and even Susan Voelz. Musically, she also reminds me of Lori, and even Happy Rhodes at points! Great purchase!"
5,wow!,I don't think you could find a better cd if you tried. The songs on this are so beautiful it's hard not to be moved by them. I can listen to it over and over again and never get tired of it. Sarah Brightman is a true goddess and an angel of music.
3,"Not for everyone, all for some","The first few notes of Brightman's CD truly impressed me. Her voice was flawless and beautiful. She has a passion for those high notes too.However, after reviewing the hole CD I was not impressed as I originally was. The first few songs on the CD didnt quite do it for me.It is probable that many will find this CD to be sensual, romantic and soothing. This CD reminds me of Enya even though Enya is Irish while Sarah is Italian. As for my favorite song on this CD, #9 better known as ""Un Jour Il Viendra."""
2,Hmph.,Sarah has a lovely crystalline quality to her voice that's very pretty. But this album is sentimentality at its very worst. Singing a bad song in Italian does not make it good.
1,Ugh!,"After listening to ""Time to Say Goodbye"" many many times and, each time, coming away from the experience with tears in my eyes and joy in my heart from the profound experience of hearing this angel sing, I find it hard to believe that ""Eden"" is by the same artist. What a mismatched hodegpodge of music; limited range both vocally and instrumentally, and, to say the least, almost monotonous sounding. Not one single cut worth listening to more than the first time and most not even then. Sounded like someone reached into a ""grab-bag"" of singles and put the first 16 on the CD. Shame...shame."
5,Sarah At her very best.,"Sarah Brightman is at the top of her game in this album. Her soprano voice is stirring in the classical numbers and her breathy pop is a nice complement. No doubt there are those who do not take to Brightman's eclectic blend of generes and her tendancy to sing any type of music. But one should not dismiss her obvious talent (though many do. Far too many reviews falsely berate her voice, as ""small, weak, shrill, emotionless, and pale"" when in fact it is sweet, soothing, crystalline, and versatile).This is a C. D. that not only every Sarah Brightman fan should own, but every sincere lover of music as well."
4,Sarah sounds beautiful from what I can hear!!,"I was a bit surprised to find that I like about every cut on this CD. I say that because I was really not that interested in the ""pop"" tracks but turns out I like em anyway.Sarah Brightman has a beautiful voice it is unfortunate that it is so far down in the mix. On many of the songs the vocal is not even close to being as loud as it should be compared to the other tracks in the song and this is very disapointing.However, since I'm a musician I may notice this more then most people will. I had purchased this CD to hear the vocal and find that I am often frustrated because I can hardly hear the vocal."
5,"Beautiful, magic music","A diverse and beautiful album with a great mixture of styles and sounds. It's like a combination of Sarah Brightman's fun album 'Dive' and the great opera on 'Time To Say Goodbye,' only better. Mellow and smooth, with her beautiful vocals... it reminds me of a breezy summer evening, right after the sun has set."
3,Good if you like Sarah,"I enjoy listening to ""Eden"" but I really have to be in a melodramatic mood. Sarah's voice is suited to the pieces she chooses to sing (that's good!), but the songs are sometimes overblown and overproduced, and her voice can get lost underneath it all. But sometimes her voice sounds too shrill, as in her version of ""My Heart Will Go On."" My favorite tracks are ""Anytime, Anywhere,"" (you'll recognize the music immediately) in which Sarah's voice is suprisingly strong; ""Dust in the Wind"" which rolls along with a hint of country to it; ""Deliver Me"" is grand enough to be on the big screen; and ""Only An Ocean Away"" has an icky beginning, but then becomes very romantic and epic-like.As usual, Sarah is fun to listen to for those with active imaginations. In some ways I enjoy Eden (which has a lot of English-language tracks) more than her previous, more subdued album ""Time To Say Goodbye."" Three out of Five stars because it's very enjoyable if you like her style."
4,It's just very lovely music........,"I've looked through some of these innane comments from so many different listeners. Some say mean things who don't like it, and some try to describe it as music from the heavens. Gawd! Just take it for what it is. Lovely music from a very talented woman. Why so many adjectives!"
5,Fabulous!,"I just love this c.d. Sometimes Sarah can be very strange, but this entire selection is beautiful! I just keep playing it over and over again."
4,"Great, one of my favorites from her","I love her classical, operatic performances, however I'm not much of a fan of her pop-ish, new age songs. That being said, this is still a wonderful album. I can't help but congratulate her for making a version of ""My Heart Will Go On"" that I can tolerate, much less enjoy."
5,Absolutely exquisite,"Sarah Brightman never ceases to amaze those of us who have followed her career,from pop to classic the mix and beyond.She and Frank Peterson are producing some wonderfuly different enchanting music and ""Eden"" will satisfy the listener's soul"
3,It's been a long time since I heard this CD,so I can't write much. But I do remember that I liked this music. It was much better than La Luna. It's not something I would listen to very often but it does set a nice mood.That was brief.
2,Very Good - but not the best.,"This is a very... different piece of craftsmanship. And I must say that Brightman has a vibrato that makes my speakers fall down on the floor. And the music is good too. BUT! Making the lead-theme out of ""The Mission""-movie to a baroque piece, isn't that just a little bit exaggerated? And her ""version"" of Händels ""Lascia ch'io Pianga"" is so utmost overwhelming. Her voice bends up and down like a kid jumping in its parents bed. I'd say that I find some of the tracks very entrancing, but I would lie if I said that I love her voice above everything else. And it's not just ""Nella Fantasia"" that I am talking about.Although I must admit that I have a little favourite on this CD. And that is of course ""Anytime, Anywhere"". THAT is beautiful. I have now two different covers on Tomaso Albinoni's ""Adagio for organ and strings""!"
2,overly loud orchestration,It is a shame that such a beautiful voice should be so overshadowed by overly loud and sometimes weird orchestration and drums.
1,Utter Dreck,"If you cannot see through the appalling singing and the self-indulgent sentimentality of the songs, this shockingly saccharine poseuse and her record company will be more than happy to take your money from you."
4,Who cares? The Americans got it made!,"Same songs on US version, released only earlier in Sarah Brightman history. My recommendation: get the US release instead. END."
5,"A great follow-up to ""Time To Say Goodby""","After the success of ""Time To Say Goodby"", which spent about 60 weeks as number one on the classical crossover chart for Sarah, it would be hard to top that success. And even tho this album may not be better, it is still so good that is is a must for all Sarah fans. If you prefer songs which are a bit less opera-like then you may even find this album better. You will find 5 to 8 songs here that will move you so much that you will be a Sarah fan from now on."
5,Superb,"Unequivically the best CD Ive ever heard. Pitch perfect voice, the 5 octave range....no one compares to the style of Sarah Brightman."
5,Songs to melt your heart,"I love Sarah brightman. I brought this album several years ago and love a number of songs on this album. Sarahs voice is like an angel. Sarah is one of he most talented and versatile cross over singers in the world today.I recommend this album to anyone, its full of wonderful warm and hair raising songs, that will make your soul saw! its pure heaven."
4,Very good,"I'll repeat what many others here have said: Sarah Brightman has the voice of an angel. After listening to her rendition of the Titanic song in Italian, I wondered, why wasn't SHE chosen to sing the movie version? She would've run circles all over Celine Dion! I also LOVE the duet she sings with Richard Marx!"
5,A True Masterpiece.......,"One of the most influential, inspiring and compelling Music that I've heard until now. An adventure into the deepest of all senses, with every song there is a fantasy or a realm that will drift you away towards a sanctuary with infinite boundaries."
3,"A Beautiful Voice, a good album, but . . .","If you like the sound of Olivia Newton-John, you'll love most of this album. Brightman's voice sounds like Newton-John's on most of the tracks, but with a sparkle that Newton-John only wishes she had. If you want an album that shows off the power and dynamic range that Brightman's wonderful soprano voice can deliver, this is probably not the CD for you. A couple of times, she lets loose with a few measures of voice that would remind you of Frederica Von Stada or Kiri Te Kanawa and those few times it is enough to cause chills to run down your spine in its splendor. I just wish Brightman would put out a full CD of the work that she is capable of, using her voice to its fullest capacity."
5,Etherial,"WOW! I ordered this CD after viewing the PBS special ""EDEN"" filmed in South Africa. I was messmerized by the program and had no choice but to follow up. What an eclectic assortment by this waifish voice. There were probably only two of the sixteen selections which did not lift me off the ground. Unlike commercial endeavors like her ""Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection"", this album is an absolutely artistic masterpiece!"
5,Get this CD,"Was a wonderful CD...especially the title track Eden. With a little remix magic, could be a nice dance song"
5,awesome!,"I love this cd. She does a beautiful remake of ""Dust in the Wind."" Also track 8 is incredible. She has the voice of an angel. It is such a soothing, relaxing cd."
3,"Excellent, but poorly mixed",This would be a superb piece of work if only Sarah's voice wasn't submerged in the background instruments. I found myself straining to hear the vocals over the accompanying din. Perhaps an equalizer would help make her more audible? A remix is definitely in order.
2,Disappointing. Nothing like her Time to Say Goodbye CD.,"The type of songs on this album are nothing like the ones on Time to Say Goodbye. They're neither beautiful nor romantic. They sound very new age-ish and don't complement her beautiful voice. Instead of trying to mix a contemporary/pop flavor to her songs, she should stay with the more classical ones. The songs on this album do not leave you feeling inspired or wanting for more."
5,She has a voice of an angel,"I have recently became a huge fan of Sarah Brightman through ""La Luna"". When I had the opportunity to buy this cd, I made no hesitation and quickly snatched up ""Eden"" to add to my cd collection. This woman is absolutely amazing.As much as I dislike ""My Heart Will Go On"", I love the Italian version of this song as well as Sarah's cover of ""Dust in the Wind"". The songs are simply stunning. Her covers are a bit hokey at best and I will admit to laughing to them when I first heard her covers but nevertheless I love the songs (covers and originals).I like how Sarah Brightman melds opera, pop and hints of electronica in her music and that is what makes her different among other female artists. She is a departure from the artists I listen to like PJ Harvey and Poe. I love her sense of overdramatic she brings to her songs although some people don't appreciate it but I can. Sarah Brightman is a true original for me."
5,Angelic voices indeed!,"Sarah Brightman's angelic voice soars well above the range and ability of most soprano operatic performers of the past. With this in mind, her talent and vocal abilities will decidedly continue to fill our hearts and heads with the utmost in this realm of music. Exquisite musical quality is found throughout this performers repertoire."
5,Simply Gorgeous!,"Eden is a wonderful CD! It is by far the best of Sarah Brightman! I recommend this CD to anyone that appreciates beautiful music. My favorite song, I think, is track 16, ""The Last Words You Said"". I was kind of disappointed when I purchased Dive, but this is wonderful! If you aren't a fan of Brightman's, you will be as soon as you hear this. It is one of the best CD's I have ever purchased, and you will feel the same!"
2,cd,"cant respond because cd was not sent new/sealed as listed by seller but received a full refund from amazon, thanks"
4,WOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNDDEEEEEERFULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL,"I love this CD !I,like one ofthe other people, used to never listen to, ""Highlights from the Phantom of the Opera! But know I do because I know that it has Sarah Brightman! ! !My most favroite singer in the wrold ! ! ! I also like Britney Spears Baby one more time . She's neet too ."
3,Orchestra 10; Sarah 3-(what happened to the balance??),"As a much awaited sequel to ""Time to Say Goodbye"", perhaps my expectations were unrealistic. While there were a few Bright(man) spots in the C.D., overall the variety and the tempo dragged. Sarah Brightman continues to impress even the most jaded listener with her artistry, but this collection bears an uncomfortable resemblance to what I think is a low spot in her career; namely- ""Dive."" Overall, not bad, even if you had to strain to hear her over the overloud orchestra."
2,"I wanted to like it, but was badly disappointed.","Time to Say Goodbye was great! From there I went to Andrea Bocelli's Romanza and Aria CDs, and on to Puccini's operas. I was hoping Sarah Brightman's newest would be more of the same fascinating bridge from classical vocals to upscale pop. But, just as with her earlier cover of Queen's raging Who Wants to Live Forever, Kansas' Dust in the Wind is a BAD choice for Ms. Brightman's sweet and prim style. Much of the rest of the album is a bit boring, certainly not something I'm going to listen to over and over. I'm glad I didn't pay full price!!"
3,Worth getting just to listen to her sing.,"Although I'm not particularly fond of some of the songs, I thought it was worth getting because it's a joy, & interesting, to hear her sing. I enjoy it, but my co-workers keep turning it off!"
4,Very enjoyable,"Although I could have done without another version of the most overrated song of the century (that godawful Titanic song), this cd shows that Time to Say Goodbye was not an anomaly. I find Brightman's voice sweet - ethereal, but it could use more depth. Truly operatic she is not, but it's nice background music at work or while reading. I still say, what I wouldn't give to be able to hit those notes so clearly..."
5,"Eden has class and Sarah is a true ""Angel of music""",Eden is the best C.D. I've bought. The quality of the music and the variety of style is extraordinary. Sarah's voice is a fresh breeze from the world of opera.
5,Beautiful,"What a beautiful CD full of wonderful songs, and a dazzling combination of techno, opera and pop. Sarah's voice is in peak form. Every song is great, but my own favorites are ""In Paradisium"", ""Eden"" and ""Only an Ocean Away"". Good work!"
5,FLAWLESS,"Everything Sarah Brightman creates is profound. ""Eden"" is another exquisite recording. The track EDEN is actually a cover of the Hooverphonic song, Sarah's version is so much more emotional and moving. She has some classical opera selections in this recording, some are contemporized and some are performed traditionally, both are enthralling and perfect as are all of the other selections."
3,A MUSIC FAN,"THE FIRST TRACK WRITTEN BY SARAH BRIGHTMAN IS DRAMATIC BUT NOT BRILLIANT. HER ITALIAN VERSION OF ""MY HEART WILL GO ON"" CANNOT SURPASSED CELINE DION'S ORIGINAL VERSION. THE BEST: ""DUST IN THE WIND"", ""NESSUN DORMA"", AND ""THE LAST WORDS YOU SAID"". THE ORCHESTRA OVERPOWERS HER VOICE."
5,Another Wow! performance from Sarah-,"I didn't think anything could equal her previous album ""Time to Say Goodbye"" but this one is different but equal in every way...so now I have two favorite albums both by Sarah Brightman...Sarah only gets better and better."
3,Good CD overall but a disappointment by Brightman's standard,"I think overall it was a good enjoyable CD. Some of the tracks are really good. Nonetheless, after hearing her ""Time to Say Goodbye"" CD, this CD simply pales in comparison. Perhaps this is not doing justice to such a talented artist but she herself has set the bar too high through her previous endeavors."
1,Excellent voice but spoiled by its background music.,"Honestly,Sarah could have done her songs solo. Or she can sing with just one instrument. I'm so sorry Sarah I have to throw out this CD."
1,The singing is cloying; the music is mishmesh. Stay away!,"Barnes and Noble bookstores have been playing this CD for two months now. Nonstop. I can't stop them from doing further damage to my eardrums, so I'll do human-kind a favor by writing a review here. Right away, you notice that Brightman's voice is tiny; it even cracks at the high ranges. Like Franz Liszt's music, she alternates between loud and soft, then slow and fast. Every word is dragged out for no apparent reason other than to fill the CD? The songs are rinky dink but Brightman makes a big deal out of each one. In all, this stuff is cloying. And I understand Brightman had soprano training? And she has fans?"
1,Not even close to her best,"I'm a huge fan Sarah Brightman fan, but this CD is a stinker. Save yourself a trip to the trash and pass on this dog."
1,Very disappointing,"I had never been a big fan of Sarah Brightman's, finding her voice kind of tinny and small. Then I accidentally listened to Time To Say Goodbye, which I adored and which I listen to over and over again. Based on that, I purchased this CD and was horrified. I only liked about 3-4 of the songs. I found it way over-produced, too loud, too showy. I think she needs to find a new agent/producer. I have purchased subsequent CD's that I like - Songs That Got Away, Andrew Lloyd Weber. But this one I returned immediately."
1,Disappointed,"This CD struck me as a bizzare and pretentious mishmash. It moves so slowly and in so many different directions that you will probably be disappointed no matter what sort of music you enjoy. Sorry. Just one person's opinion, but a sincere one."
5,"fabulous voice/music/clarity/style, veiled some by poor mix","ETHERIAL - - - SPIRITUAL - - - UPLIFTING - - SUBLIME - - - OTHER WORLDLY - - - THOUGHT PROVOKING - - - DREAMLIKE - - - MAGICAL ! This musical experience is one of the best albums I've ever purchased. It's wonderful! I do however agree with another Amazon customer/reviewer that the background music is a tad too overpowering. The engineering is not as good as it could or should be, I'm afraid. I still enjoy the album immensely though and would buy it again. I LOVE IT ! I can hardly get this music out of my head, (nor would I want to). Thank You Sarah Brightman, - - - for being you! If you're a ""seeker or a thinker"", I know you're going to appreciate this ""vaporous"" material. In some ways, it's a little like a canvas to ""paint"" your thoughts on. Words can hardly convey my praise for this work! This will be a tough act to follow up with, even for Sarah! (BUT PLEASE DO!)"
5,Incredible,"This music was sent to me in 1996 on a cassette from a radio station and i had been looking for it on cd since. When I saw it on your site, I bought 3. It is so nice I have the music of Juan Guerra with words but the classical version of Estrellitas y Duendes, you do not need to know any language to love it."
1,Awful,"It sounds like the music is based on the artwork. This is the ""Captain Planet"" of music CDs. Of course, if you make a music CD that says ""Yes, we can deport you all"", it would be protested by these illegals whom can't vote anyways (well, legally, but they still do in Wisconsin and California)"
1,Incredible!,"I find it amazing that this book got published, considering its low level of scholarship. It appears to be the unedited ravings of a businessman who no longer does therapy. Can you say ""out of touch?"" The world of psychotherapy has moved far beyond the paradoxical and probably unethical advice given in this expensive book."
4,Focused Psychotherapy,"An innovative method of providing a motivational framework to a managed care model. Some benefits include teaching treatment team(s) to be interdisciplinary vs. multidisciplinary, to conceptualize a consumer using a psychologically focused collaborative format vs. each group seeing the consumer from there training perspective, and working expeditiously to bring the salient issues together for the staff, consumer and surveying bodies. It has its limitations as all theories of treatment will yet it is exciting, revolutionary and largely evidenced based/best practice driven."
5,Best Toaster Ever,"My neighbor had this toaster in black/brushed silver and paid $59 at a large kitchen store. Neeedless to say, I was thrilled to find it at half the price and in white. It is simply and stylishly designed, and toasts quickly and evenly. And it can even lift your toast post-toast so you don't have to fish your smaller pieces out with a knife or risk scorching your fingers. Has a built-in warming plate for danish, Defrost and Bagel settings, and a ""stop"" feature to eject toast mid-toast. Looks and works like toasters twice the price... and SO outperforms the crappy $12 toasters at your local Superstore."
2,Krups FEP2W Toaster - not great,"This toaster peformed moderately well, but died after just two years. It tended to overcook toast on the top and undercook towards the bottom of the slice. Will no longer stay down, though the elements continue to work if the lever is held down manually. However, all toasting functions are gone and it is basically useless. I realize there is only a 1 year warranty, but we expected better than this from Krups. I'd avoid buying this again."
2,Does not toast,"I set the toaster to the highest setting, and the toast come out mostly white with a very thin crust."
1,Scammed,"Jan 06 I bought this product as a present for my bf, and when I received the package, the armband looked like a cheap fake model of what I saw online. The armband itself was UGLY HOSPITAL GRAY and the holder was not clear white - it was UGLY GELATIN OPAQUE. It's UGLY. WOrks fine though.It is now the beginning of Sept, and my bf never ran with the band, and it broke."
5,Perfect Armband,I purchased the armband so that I can utilize my MP3 while running. The case is made of a stretchy material which fits the player very well. The strap is adjustable with velcro. I couldn't be more satisfied. It is definitely worth it!
3,Armband for Sony MP3 Player,"I love the armband as it is convenient for working out in the gym without having to manage the player. However, the silicone case is cheap! It tore in three places within owning and using if for 2 weeks!!!"
3,"Ok, but wears and tears really easy","I use this to run and workout, it didnt take but a month before it started ripping and now thank god its tight rubber, or it wouldnt hold my sony mp3 player anymore. Ok, but they need to make a better one."
5,Review for Speak,"Speak is a very good book. It is about a girl who has a hard time just starting High School. It deals with the stress of finding the right cliques, friends, and basically just acceptance of other students. Personally, I loved the book and I would recommend it to anyone who understands the harsh reality of High School."
5,Teens can really relate,"I loved this book! It was so nice to finally have a book to really relate too. Im going through all the same things right now, because I started High School a month ago, and I have no friends, spet one. So i can be hard, and its really nice to watch Melinda go through the same things as me."
4,Speak,"In the novel Speak, Laurie Halse Anderson describes the main character, Melinda Sordina, as an outcast. The summer before her freshman year of high school, Melinda calls the police to end the big ""End of Summer Bash."" When she returns to school in the fall, she finds herself disliked by most of her classmates. Her friends from the years before don't like her and she is having a hard time dealing with the traumatic event that occurred at the party. I would definitely recommend this book because it is very precise on some of the feelings that teenage girls have. Everyone feels alone at one time or another and the way Laurie Halse Anderson describes Melinda's emotions very accurately"
4,Speak,"In Speak, Laurie Halse Anderson unweaves the story of a girl who finds her inner strength. The summer before her freshman year, Melinda finds herself in a dangerous situation at a party and calls the police. When she attends school in September, everyone blames her for ending the party and she is left alone to deal with what really happened. Anderson's depiction of Melinda's feelings gives the reader a greater understanding of the suffering the character endures. Speak captures the struggles that teenagers face on a daily basis-the fear of rejection and the undying need for acceptance. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to ages 13 and over."
4,Insiteful,"This book was very interesting. If I had been raped, I would of had that boy in court by tomorrow. This book tells of a girl's struggles after a traumatic experience. Struggles to live on, deal with it, and yes, to speak. Even though her life was at first sort of depressing, it got better. The character herself had a great personality, and a lot of teenage girls can probably relate to her. I know a girl who was raped as a child who refuses to tell her parents. We all probably know somebody, or know them and not know they were raped. Even though I usually go for the strong female image, this book was an exception. I couldn't put it down, I just had to see what happened. I will be sure to read all of the author's works."
3,Good/ Bad Speak,I give Speak a 3. Speak earned a 3 because after a while you were just waiting for the end. This book is about a traumatized ninth grade girl who doesn't talk due to an experience that happened at a party the previous summer. The whole book basically results in Melinda finding herself and getting the guts to admit to herself and her ex-best friends what happened. I did like this book because seeing life from her view was funny yet sad. I didn't like this book because it was to predictable. I recommend this book to people who can take violent scenes and have the patience to read and wait. I do not recommend this book to people who are not mature and who are impatient.
5,SPEAK book review,"All I can say is that every girl should read this book. It is clever, witty, heartbreaking. I laughed, I cried, I got angry...I took the journey with Melinda. It wasn't always a happy one, but it was an enlightening, and empowering one!Highly recommend!"
5,Wow!,One of my favorite english teacher's read this to us. I loved it and decided it needed to be on my book shelf at home. It made me so happy for the young girl to get her life back. Great book!!! I would hand you this book and suggest you read it. You might like it. You might not. But you could still read the first few pages and see for your self.
5,It's going to be in my classroom from now on!,"In my search for young adult literature which features an interesting and modern female protagonist, I have read several excellent books. Based on the extremely enthusiastic recommendation of some of my high school students, I read ""Speak"" and knew right away I had found a book worth buying in quantity and studying in class. The hilarious, pointed observations of high school life alone make the book worth reading, but its understanding and insightful treatment of a serious problem makes it worth studying.Boys may object, calling it a ""girl book,"" but I predict that they will enjoy the book within the first few pages as they laugh at Melinda's wickedly funny comments on high school and later sympathize with her conflicted emotions about ""Him."" Get this book, read it, enjoy it, and pass it on to a high schooler you know!"
5,Very powerful and moving,This book was very well written and you could really feel the pain that Melinda felt. I felt the walls closing in on her as she struggled to find the right time to find her voice and speak up about what happened to her. I can only imagine that this feeling is very real for so many victims of rape.
3,Worth the Read!,"I found this to be a decent read. I do like how the author does a relatively sophisticated job keeping me on my toes and not just spilling beans right away what really happened to the Melinda character and why she's turned into person she turned into during her freshman year of high school. However, my emotional rapport, didn't seem to resonate as strong like others who read it. The book was a bit of slow burn until the last thirty pages everything tied in adequately.Another reason into why I didn't find myself engrossed into the book there wasn't much girt and action as I'd hoped. I truly appreciated how the story ended; how the reader could draw their own conclusions from this dark, yet brave character Melinda.Things you can look forward to in this edition is a candid interview into the author and how she came about writing Speak, statistical facts, and a discussion guide (perfect those who are in reading groups and using it for classroom settings)."
4,Interesting Book,"As a 30 year old male I found this book compelling enough to read it very quickly and in the end was impressed by this short novel. The only thing I felt could be improved was the structure and layout, having one character say something to the narrator and have the narrator respond back withMe:indicating they didn't say anything back is somewhat confusing. I would highly recommend this book to teen girls though and also some teen boys."
3,Speak review,"I would recommend Speak to any young adults that prefer books dealing with teen issues. It is a captivating book that keeps your attention, while presenting a meaningful theme for young people. Older readers may not enjoy this book, because the narrator, Melinda, talks and thinks like a teenager. People that do not even remember their teenage days may not be able to relate to a book like Speak. For young women that are having trouble dealing with their emotions, this is an influential book that may help you open up. You will learn about stereotypes and symbolization, but the book is not at all too hard to follow. If you enjoy books that affect your emotions and make you think, then Speak is definitely your kind of book."
5,Speak,"Speak is about a freshman girl named Melinda, and her struggle through her first year of highschool. A recent event at a party left her emotionally scarred. She has become a social outcast, and had no one there for her. She has to deal with her unsupportive parents, who are emotionally distant with her. It was her compassionate art teacher and her meaningful artwork that helped her speak. This book has always been one of my favorites, and I highly reccomend reading it. Anderson is a great writer, and makes you feel as if you were walking in Melinda's shoes."
3,Wouldn't Consider it Amazing,A bunch of people have said this book is AMAZING but I finished it wondering if I had the wrong book. You knew the ending from the very beginning and it just follows through Melinda's life that is falling apart. But I'm not good at summarizing so I won't go there. I mean I'll read anything and I do like books that just follow somebody's life but when you read the whole book knowing the ending it's just not something that I enjoy.
4,what i think of speak!,"I think the book Speak is a very good book. Well, so far of what I've read;I've read up to pg 120. I find this book very interesting and it relates to me a little bit to because I got raped just like this girl did and I was also scared to tell anyone. I think you could learn a lot by reading this book. I know I am!"
5,Words Of Emotion,"Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson is one of those special books that comes along once in a great while. It is a novel that will touch the hearts of many young females, but will also appeal to the male, seeing that I read the book and enjoyed it thoroughlly. We meet Melinda, and are taken away into her depressed and sedated world. We wonder why this young freshman is the way she is, why she feels so alone, why she has a horrible outlook on life, and why she never talks. The novel symoblizes the typical teenage life, being exact on almost every topic and opinion that is addressed in the novel. Laurie Halse Anderson shows here that she is a phenomnol writer. One who knows her audience and strikes home with them. She writes words of emtion, and makes us feel weak at heart, which is the message she is trying to deliever."
5,One of the best books in a long time.,I couldn't put this book down. I loved it. you can feel what melinda is going through.You have to read this book!
5,Speak,"I would recommend Speak for 7th grade and up. This amazing novel talks about the troubles of a freshman that at the end of a summer party called the police, and now none of her friends will talk to her. High school should be one of the greatest times of her life, but the only thing she enjoys is art class. Then end of the school year is coming and still she won't speak or tell the truth. Once again her grades start to fall and soon she begins to tell people what really happened that night. I think this book is a wonderful lesson to human life in that when ever something goes wrong nothing can be more valuable than speech. Also this is a tender, loving story that tells you about the struggles of a teenage outcast."
4,Lala's Review!,"I really enjoyed reading Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson. I thought that it had a really good story, like it's very believeable. I really liked the book because she describes the characters so well and i can relate to the kids at school and how they're treating her. It really depicts how children are when they're at school and what they go through. Plus it had a lot of humor like how the main character, (Melinda) describes the teachers and the kids at school. I think that in all it was a good book & something a teenager would really enjoy."
4,Speak,"The book Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson is great. It is a novel about a teenage girl named Melinda who has several problems. She is a freshman at a high school, and she is an outcast. She is very lonely and unhappy. Her friends no longer speak to her, because over the summer Melinda calls the police when she is at a party. She called the police for a reason, but she does not get to explain herself right away. Since everyone is angry with her, she does not start her first high school year off right. She struggles throughout the whole year. She is so depressed that she does not want to speak. I liked this book because it was very powerful, realistic, and humorous. I am not a very strong reader, but this book was very easy to read and understand. I think Laurie Anderson did an amazing job expressing Melinda's feelings and thoughts."
4,Speak Review,"Freshman, Melinda Sordino, starts high school depressed and outcast. The entire school hates her for calling the cops on an end-of-the-summer party. Her friends have deserted her without even trying to find out the truth of what really happened. Slowly Melinda stops speaking to her parents, teachers, and even her peers. Anytime she sees Andy Evens, a popular senior boy, she feels paralyzed like a rabbit around a predator. Through her artwork, Melinda shows her feelings of depression and loneliness. She has a secret that she can't tell anybody. Will Melinda ever be able to tell this secret? Find out at the end of the story when the truth is finally revealed.Laurie Halse Anderson's novel is a wonderful tribute to teenage life with all the realistic dramas and conflicts all young adults go through. All readers will relate to the isolation and confusion Melinda expresses in her sad and humorous story."
4,Speak!!!!!,"Wonder what it is like being an outcast at your high school? What about turning into this outcast all of a sudden, when you used to be just like all the other kids?That is what Melinda Sardino, the main character in Laurie Halse Anderson's ""Speak"", feels like. Something happened to her during her summer going into 9th grade, that made her call the cops at a party, causing everyone to hate her. The problem for Melinda is that she doesn't have anyone to talk to about it. None of her friends from middle school like her anymore, and they all separated into different clans. Will Melinda find new friends? Will she find someone to talk to, someone she can trust, so she can tell everything that happened to her? There is only one way to find out, and that is reading the book.I really liked this book because it connects with a lot of things i have seen in high school. It is about a typical 9th grade student struggling to survive through her first year of high school."
3,speak,"product was a little more damaged than the description lead on to, but the book over all was in descent condition."
3,Just average...,"Speak is another book about the cruelties of high school and what it's like to be an outcast. While I like the narrative, it was just too boring most of the time and only once every 10 or so pages something slightly intresting or something that slightly has to with the plot, came up. It was too spaced out.The intensity slope on this book never really gets too steep. It's more of just a little speed bump. And the ending isn't really the most intense either. It only lasts about 4 pages and doesn't really give us anything reasonable to work with. It shows that she couldn't speak, and when she finally wanted to speak, she chose to use violence instead. Great theme (sarcasm).If you want a great coming-of-age story, pick The Perks Of Being A Wallflower. Nothing I've read has come close."
2,?,"I don't know what all this fuss is about. I read this book a while ago, and it's not that I didn't like it, but I didn't love it either. The language is kind of boring, it's not a 'read it in a day or else' book, you are not curious about the end or the twists that might happen... and so on. It's about a girl who goes through a frightening experience and loses her self confidence. I'm not saying I don't feel symphathy; it's just that there are many books out there that are worth reading and worth 5 stars other than this one. Don't waste this time unless you have no books to read other than this one. Or you LOOOVE stories with troubled teens. In that case, I would recommend Robert Cormier; not this one."
4,Speak,"During the summer, Melinda goes to party, but somthing happens and she calls the cops. They come, her friends and a lot of other people get in trouble, but she is nowhere in sight.This a great book, that is a great pick for teens. Speak, by Larrie Halse Anderson is about a girl named Melinda who is having emtional trouble, and trouble with friends because of what she did that summer. She is a 9th grader in high school, and loves drawing. The school is a lot like how they are today. There are popular groups, and not so popular groups. Most of her teachers are like todays, horrible and boring ones. And then she has 2 that are great and help her through her struggle.The auther also does a very, very good job discribing her emotions and her thoughts, making you feel as if you are Melinda. This is a great book and I strongly suggest it to you."
5,Tell everyone about speak!,"Speak is about a girl named Melinda whoso whole life went upside down after calling the cops at a summer end party. None of her frinds will talk to her and she is an outcast from the school. She has no where to express her feelings until she starts art class. It is a place for her where she can speak but say no words at all.I really enjoyed reading this book. It made really feel sad and angrey for the characters. It was one book that I never wanted to put down. It makes cry,smile and scream. I recomend this book to everyone."
5,"""Speak"" Captures All the Things in Life","The first time I heard about this book, I wasn't very interested.After reading it in a time period of two days,I thought different.This book is absolutly great!The writer writes with a flow that didn't get me at all bored.I don't know the age of the writer but she writes so much like I think.Everything that happens in this book are things that people deal with every single day in their life.Laurie's story about just a ""Regular"" young girl and her life through her freshman year in high school may sound boring but Laurie's use of subject and description keep it interesting.Laurie's book is brilliant."
5,amazing,"I first read this book back in HS and it really touched me. Yes I've been through it, I understand how you felt, but its so different to. This book touched many people in my class and has been carried along with us. I recommend it to people of all ages constantly. I believe it is a must read for everyone, male or female. It forces you to understand and read about a topic that is never spoken. It brings things up to light that no one will comment on."
4,Kathy speaks about Speak!,"As soon as I recieved this book from my English teacher I could not put it down. This book is a great choice if you want to read about important topcs like rape, and adolescents. This book is one of my favorites and I have recommended it to all of my friends. I hope everyone reads and enjoys Speak. It is a great book that a person any age can enjoy."
1,Very Boring,The characters have no depth and the book is very cliche. The biggest problem is that the book is written at a very low reading level (I'd say about 4th or 5th grade) but is meant for older teens.
5,"Boys should read it, too","Wow. This book has hit a home run with every kid in my school who's read it--male or female. Captures the torture this girl endures when peer judgment crashes down on her. More people, not just teenage girls, need to ""speak"" about the unspeakable, and this book shows why. Real and gripping and deeply moving."
5,"My Opinion of ""Speak""","I truly believe ""Speak"" was a great book. I did a research paper on it, but actually ENJOYED reading it. And I am NOT a reader. Teens, most of us don't want to read a book that we can't relate to. It's boring, right? Well ""Speak"" is something most people can relate to. Being in high school, making new friends, dealing with teachers and boys... everyone will relate and feel for the main character, Melinda. READ THIS BOOK! You will be hooked- I promise."
5,review for tennage girls,"I,m one of thoes people who reads in every moment im not online. I am very critical of books, and I have read books that my freinds said were amazing and I thought they were completly stupid. But this is the most INCREDIBLE book Ive ever read. It is my favorite book of all time. I laughed out loud countless times. the only other books i laugh outloud from are the angus thongs... series this is completly the best book you'll ever read.sara"
3,Not that good,I was really surprised when i finally received the book because as i read it i didnt really compare myself to the character. It wasnt a memorable story that i can later mention or want to. It really surprised me to see such a book be a waste on the topic. Well i dont recommend it as a favorite book but if you need something to pass the time i guess it would be good.
2,good storyline but poorly written,"although speak was written with the best intentions of portraying a lost confused teen, the way anderson writes makes the book too predictable. if your an avid reader you know whats going to happen before you turn the next page."
4,Speak,The book that I read was called speak. This book was about a girl who was an outcast. She had only one fried called Heather who only lasted part of the year. The year before she had gone to a party and was being harrassed. She didnt now what to do so she called the cops. The only reason she had a friend was beacaue she was new at school and didnt know what happened. She had bad parents who would talk to her by putting post-it notes on the refrigerator. She like this one guy at school but didnt tell anyone. He was a nerdish person. This book is a very good book for people who like journal type books and like to find out what will happen to the person. This book was probably one of the best books. You should buy it because you will like it.
4,Speak,The book that I read was Speak. In the story there was a girl who went to a party and called the cops. After she did that nobody wanted to be her friend. All of her old friends ignored her or laughed at her. She had very bad grades except she was good at art. During the time she had a friend called Heather but Heather becomes embarrassed and ends up not being her friend. She has parents who never cook and just leave post-it's every time they want to tell her something. In school she found an old janitors closet that was abandoned so she decided to make it her special place just for her. She is an outcast. The people who would like this book are people who like journal type books and like to listen to what people have to say. It is a good book for middle school kids and adults too. It is the best book I have read all year. You should buy it because you will like it.
5,Speaking The Truth,"This book was awsome! When I first read it, I read it over and over again. I got my friends to read it too. One of my friends told her cousin to read it, since she had the same experiences as Melinda. When she read it, she became inspired. I still read this book anytime I can."
3,Speak,The book Speak was an interesting but sometimes boring story of a girl in the ninth grade at Merryweather High School. I thought that some parts of it actually pertained to real life in High School but other things weren't quite accurate in my perspective.She goes through life with an attitude where she has problems but makes no effort to fix them. She is always depressed and she thinks there is nothing she can do to make her life less stressful and more enjoyable. It was a well-written book but I just didn't have interest in reading about these things.
3,Speak,"The novel, Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson is an interesting book about Melinda Sordino, a teenager trying to overcome the challenges she faces during her first year of high school. After facing a traumatic experience during the summer, she is now an outcast. All of her friends have found cliques and nobody wants to invite her to join theirs. Through her witty sarcasm and provoking thoughts, readers learn about her emotional scars and deep wounds that she bears inside. As the year progresses, Melinda works on opening up and facing her feelings through her artwork and other activities that she occupies her time with.The book is a quick read and enjoyable for teenagers and adults."
5,Speak,"New to high school, Melinda Sordino finds her friends have disowned her, and classes are much more difficult than she expected. Armed with a sarcastic and even sometimes sardonic attitude, she sets out to make the best of things. Unfortunately, her friends' relentless silent treatment and her less-than-adept teachers cause her plans to fall through.Faced with no one to talk to and her far below adequate grades, Melinda does the only thing she can think of: not talk. But instead of simplifying things, her troubles only seem to multiply with her newfound silence.Anyone who's ever felt left out will enjoy this story. I found Melinda wry and easy to relate to, and her stereotypical high school seemed a facsimile of mine. Speak is a must read for any high school student, or even anyone who's ever been to high school. Laurie Halse Anderson does a wonderful job bringing that sad, sarcastic little person who lives inside us all to life."
5,Speak,"The order arrived quicker than expected. The book is wonderful to use with my 8th grade students and the fact that the reader is a young girl, sets the tone of the book. Excellent!!!"
4,Speak,"This was a very good book. It was about Melinda, and something bad happened to her during a summer party. Now she's a social outcast and people hate her, because she called the cops during the party and they don't know the whole truth. Melinda keeps everything bottled up inside her, and when she finally tells about what happened she isn't believed, until the end when people finally understand.I really liked this book, because it can relate to any teenager."
4,"""SPEAK"" Laurie Anderson at her best","1B-Danielle S.When I read the book ""Speak I find it to be very interesting. When you first pick up the book you might find it to be a little boring; but you should keep reading. Once you do that you'll find it hard to look away. Tje book contains all of the characteristics of a story and is well written. If I had to I would recommend this book to any and everybody."
4,A well-written novel,"When I first decided to read this book, I was hesitant to read it because I thought it would be depressing and sad. Even thought it was at times a little sad, most of the book takes you inside the mind of the main character, Melinda Sordino, who decides to spend her freshman year at high school as a mute as a result of a traumatic event that occured during the summer. Through the novel, Melinda goes through imaginable things that none of us would want to deal with. However, I could not put this book down, no matter how hard I tried. Laurie Halse Anderson keeps you hooked on every word, and makes you feel like you know Melinda as if she were your own friend."
5,My opinion on this book,I thought this book was very well written. It expressed the views of a girl who had been raped very well. I think that it might of helped someone who had been raped to speak and to report it. If all of the raped women and men reported it we could get the horrible people who did it off the streets.
5,Awesome Book,This book was very good and I enjoyed reading it. I'm going to go read more of her work.
5,Melinda Needs A Friend,"Melinda went to an end of the summer party before school started. At the party there was drinking and many people doing things they weren't supposed to do. Melinda was scared, she didn't know what to do. Something had happened to her at the party that night. The first thing she did was pick up the phone and called the cops. When someone saw her on the phone, they grabbed it and heard the cop on the phone saying they were on their way. Everyone started yelling at her and running out the door. By the time school rolled around, none of her old friends would even look at her.This book is a really good book. At the beginning, all it says is that she called the cops at a party. It keeps you waiting through about half of the book wondering why she called the cops at that summer party. When you finally find out the thrilling news, about what really happened that night, you can understand why she called the cops. This book is thrilling, keeps you wondering, and is very realistic."
4,Teen Troubles Not Often Spoke About,"Laurie Halse Anderson's book ""Speak"" is an excellent book for teens and young adults. The content is extremely meaningful. Laurie HAlse Anderson uses this book to express to teens the idea that nothing can be done to help unless you'll talk to some one. This books theme ad and purpose are extremely wonderful, as is the story line. This book is excellent for Literature projects for eight and ninth grade students, or a grat book to read just because. I found ""Speak"" a respectable novel due to the fact that it discusses real problems that other authors are afraid to write about. All together this is an extremely good book that you find yourself not wanting to put down."
4,Speak,"Melinda: scared, outcast, discarded. That's how she feels. In this novel, Miss Laurie Anderson explores the world of a teeage girl who has experienced something very traumatic, whom no one talks to anymore. They all feel she ruins the big summer party, but she was really just trying to save herself. I enjoyed this book. It was easy to read and a quick read for people who want to find comfort, that their lives aren't so bad."
5,4 1/2 stars!!,"""Wow..."" was the first word I said after finishing this great book. This book was one of the best coming-of-age novels I've read in a long time. Melinda Sordino (main character) rocks!! It's about a teenager, Melinda, just starting her freshman year in high school with a terrible beginning. In the summer, she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops because an older senior boy raped her at the party. But nobody knows that except Melinda so everyone hates her, even her best friend. Now Melinda has to fight her demons and speak the truth. But will it turn out all right? Find the answer to this question and a couple more when you pick up Speak."
5,Best Book!,"Melinda is a teenager outcast. Who feels she needs to keep her mouth shut to stop the violence. She busted an end-of-the-summer party because someone rapped her outside. Now when she meets up with this guy. He tries to beat... her, but she gets away. I feel sorry for this teenager, but I'm glad she choose to bust the party because she would have been more miserable if she hadn't. This book I rated 5 [*s] because it's such a page turner in some ways. It so realistic that it seems true life like a non-fiction story. I wish Laurie Halse Anderson would make a sequel. It was a great book!"
2,Well....,"Maybe it's just me. I've wormed my way past the drama of the teenage years with never having much of the drama that popular media is so happy to display as the norm. Not that what happens in this novel isn't serious or horrible, but goodness, did it take an entire book to tell us that?We have a girl. We don't see much of her personality (does she have one?) or character. She's miserable, and it's pretty clear from the beginning why. Unfortunately, I was only able to give her the smallest hint of pity because, hey, I didn't care about her. That's important for writing: make us care!Another mistake of teen novels: stereotypes. It was sickening to behold. No one is given a chance to develop, no one is anything but what society says they are. It's PATHETIC and needs to stop.Still, the author made a good attempt, and the writing itself was quite lovely. Still not enough to merit a recommendation."
3,A depressing book,This book had an adult topic and was written in a unusual way which takes getting used to. A realistic veiw of a depressed high school student trying to cope with a rape. The writer really involves the reader and opens your eyes to real life situations.
3,Speak Review,I did not like speak as much as i thought i would. I felt as though the book was boring and did not seem to have much setting change. The one part of the book i liked was the ending because of the twist it had. I did not think that the plot of the book about a girl who calls the cops on a party in the summer that she lost all of her friends over could have been written better. Overall i did not like this book.
3,KDH Reviews,"You can read this and other reviews on my blog, KDH Reviews.I read some reviews on Goodreads and was sure that Speak was going to be one of those books that I'd have to recommend to my reader friends. Whenever I finished the book, though, I failed to see what everyone else saw. Somehow, Speak manages to be a quick read while still being slightly boring.This story had so much potential. All that potential got lost somewhere along the way.Favorite Quote""Think about love, or hate, or joy, or rage -- whatever makes you feel something, makes your palms sweat or your toes curl. Focus on that feeling. When people don't express themselves, they die one piece at a time. You'd be surprised at how many adults are really dead inside -- walking through their days with no idea who they are, just waiting for a heart attack or cancer or a Mack truck to come along and finish the job. It's the saddest thing I know."""
5,A Fantastic Young Adult Novel And An Excellent Treatment of Sexual Assault from a Teen's Perspective,"It's difficult to breach the topic of sexual assault to teens, but Speak does a fine job. I have some gripes with the ending, but overall I'm very satisfied with it."
5,Speaking without words,"Speak is a book about a teenage girl who is an outcast, after an unknown mistake she doesn't reveal until the end of the story. She is very troubled and lonely as none of her friends want to be near her anymore. She starts to make friends with a girl named Heather, who helps her get through lunch unoticed. As the story unfolds, she gets closer and closer to telling her secret.In my opinion Speak is one of the better books I have read during my life. I enjoyed the humerous and mysterious outlooks that the girl, Melinda, has on life and the teenage population. She expresses strongly her beliefs on school, cliques, and life. Through her sarcastic eyes, a new world can be seen.The theme of the story seems to be about what can be said without speaking. The book is extreemly funny and great for someone who likes to be kept wondering. It is also, however, a book that will shock you in the end, far from its humerous beginning."
4,Better than chocolate,"I think that this book is better than chocolate. I really got into the book. Once I start I could not put it down. The book really speaks to young people. If you are a outcast or a new kid you can related to the character. Also it shows that there is always someone that you can turn to, you should never be scaried to tell someone what happend to you. It was one of the best books that I have ever read....I think that everyone teenager should read this book."
4,My thoughts on Speak,"This book is very good because it talks about the life of a troubled teenager. Melinda the main character just started school at Merrryweather High and has no friends. She goes through problemes some teens go through now. She is depressed and doesn't want to tell what is bothering her.She has problems with her school work and doesn't talk to her parents much either. She is like that because she doesn't want to tell any one she has been raped at a party she was in. She called the cops and they stopped the party. No one talks to her becuase of that, but in the end she reveals her secret.By Pedro Alvarez"
5,A Great Read,"This was a really great read. Melinda's voice compelled me to listen. Listen to her story. Learn how she lives.This book covered a year in Melinda's life in under 200 pages. You don't get a day by day description of her life. This sparse writing worked well because you know that, for the most part, her life is monotonous, one day being the exact same as the last.I wasn't really sure what to expect from this book. Thankfully, I was surprised in a good way. It's a lot deeper than I had imagined. While she battles her demons, Melinda walks anonymous among her schoolmates and family. I wanted to scream at them. Couldn't they see what she was going through? The pain she endures?This was a fabulous read. You should definitely pick it up"
4,Awesum book! by Kaylin Mccarthy,"The book I read for my report was ""speak"" By Laurie.h. Anderson. This book takes place in the late 1990's in a rual area. This book is about friendships and emotional problems.The main Character and narrator,Melinda,is a bit shy and untrusting of people. No one really anymore due to a trumatic event that occured during the summer. Another important charater was heather. Heather was alittle geeky, but very out-going and wanted everyone to like her.Heather and Melinda became friends when no one would even acknowledge them.The author used a lot of forshadowing to tell about some of the events that took place during the summer.Like when one of melinda's ex-friends asked hre why she had called the cops.I really liked this book. It really made me think about friend and who was a actual true friend to me.Infact melinda acted somewhat how I do, so I could really relate to this story.This book is a definate read!"
5,A Must-Read,"""Speak"" is a wonderfully touching book about an all-too-real freshman, Melinda, who has been deserted by her friends because of her ruining a summer party by calling the police. She keeps the true reason of calling to herself, thinking that they wouldn't believe her. The person that helps her the most is her art teacher, whom she doesn't like too much at first; but with what seems to be a simple assignment, Melinda recovers more and more.One of my friends pointed this book out to me. I read it in a day, unable to put it down. It is an incredible page-turner that certainly changed my outlook on the world. I wouldn't really be able to live without it."
5,Speak captures Audiences of all ages,As soon as I started reading this book I knew it would be a hit. I loved the whole book. I couldn't put it down till the very end. I couldn't stop. I just kept reading and reading. The main polt of the story is this Girl who does not talk to anyone because she is afraid. During the summer she was raped at a party. She doesn't tell anyone. This book is so filled with emotion I cried at times. When the book was over I actually seriously upset it was over.
5,This was a GREAT book!!,"... ""Speak"" was a fabulous book for girls going into their teens to an adult. It described realistic situations that young girls should know about. The book was well written and kept me interested to the end! READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Speak,"It's a good story, kinda slow, but I could relate to Melinda..and I figured out early on what happened at the party. I had to keep reading to see if she survived. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid her parents were. Your child is all of a sudden not talking , skipping school and failing grades...and you don't try to find out what the problem is? Give me a break. If you have never been in this position..you probably won't understand the ""inside Melinda""..."""
3,"Good book, but narration is deadpan & dull","I found this a very interesting and sad story. I felt so sorry for Melinda, and I completely understood how she sort of curled into herself as a result of what happened. I also thought the trees were really effective metaphors for how she coped with her pain & rejection, then finally was able to ""prune"" the damage and emerge stronger.My complaint about this read is with the narrator (I listened to it on CD). I thought her voice was deadpan and dull, and though she attempted to create inflection & expression, it fell flat for me. This perhaps could have been deliberate (and in some respects it could be seen as an appropriate performance choice), but due to the emotionally ravaged content in some places, I would have preferred a more dramatic narrator."
4,speak,"The book speak written by Laurie anderson, tell about the troubles of a high school freshman outcast Melinda Sorendino.It all starts at a summer party and somthing terrible happens turning all her friends agianst her. When school starts up everyone hates her, but she finds refuge in her art class where she's taken under the wing of her wacky teacher Mr.Freeman. Her assignment is to draw a tree by the end of the year. This is kind of an important topic in the book because as the year goes by she breaks off all her dead branches.Later on in the book she starts to tell her what happend at the party and regain some confidence, and by the end of the year she reveals what happend and at first her old friends just think she is jelous but later on they find out that what she said was the truth and its a happy ending.I recomend this book to any teens that are having trouble in life it might help!Over its a great book everything a book should have."
2,Outraged,"Where have our morals gone? As an adult, I can understand and appreciate the content of this story. However, my 13 year old daughter found the main character just plain weird. Melinda is inadequately coping with a traumatic event. She is suffering from depression and needed intervention. The story goes on and on trying to show she is an outcast. Do not confuse ""outcast"" with depression. An average American teenager does not have the wisdom or maturity to recognize the difference. This story needs to be followed up with a discussion on how to handle rape-medically and emotionally. As a medical professional I was disgusted that Melinda never received any professional help-now that would be a teaching moment for teenagers!"
2,I liked the school but the big mystery was no mystery,"The writing in this book is good. I find Laurie Halse Anderson's style very readable. However, I had guessed the big secret before the third chapter, so for the rest of the book I found myself just sort of waiting for the resolution. I felt that the resolution, when it came, was good."
2,"Eh, maybe I had high expectations","I thought that the main character, Melinda, would lose her voice or get sick where she lost her voice, from the other reviews I had read. It actually didn't happen. She just didn't talk around adults and picked at her lips.I like the overall message. It is satisfying at the end. But I think it could have been written better. It fell flat for me. There weren't enough descriptions. The character development was superficial. It seemed everyone had a role and that was the only role they played."
2,Speak,"I was ambivalent about reading this book from the beginning. I know a LOT of people find this their teenage Catcher in the Rye, but to me it was very depressing. Though the situations in this book can happen to everyone, Laurie Halse Anderson didn't write them in a very reader-friendly way. In a way it was sort of painful to read the book, not because of her emotional decline but because of how she can't talk to her parents, or to anyone in that matter, but in my opinion parents are always who to turn to. but Melinda seems to bring this on herself, so I can't feel too bad for her. overall this book is not horrible, but I would not read it again. make sure that you are at an age when you read this book, where you can handle intense situations and don't mind being pulled into this semi-strange characters mind."
3,ok purchase,the price was great and the story itself was ok. it's another look at pressures placed on girls during high school
3,nicole's student book review,"This book is thrilling and keeps the reader wanting more. ""Speak"" by Laurie Anderson is about an outcast teenager named Melinda Sordino in her first year in high school. But she wont say anything, she is completely mute. The only thing that helps her feel safe is doing her art project with her art teacher named Mr. Freeman. She likes her lab partner named Dave who she thinks is her hero for standing up to their Social studies teacher, Mr. Neck. Th8is is a book that the reader will not ever want to put down."
4,REALISTIC,"The author gets the reader hooked on the book by keeping the problem a secret. After reading the book, I realized how helpful and realistic this book is for troubled teenagers. Some young people can and will be able to relate to some of the issues within the story."
3,and they all lived happily ever after......,"I am not going to say that this was a bad book, because it wasn't. I thought, up until the end, it was very well written. The book was very suspenseful and had some realistic situations. I could see some of myself in Melinda. What I don't get is why it had to end so badly. I mean so she so unpopular and then.....she got popular? Things just don't happen that quickly. What makes a really good story is the ending. If a story is good then the author rushes through the end, then it makes me wonder why I thought it was so good. I was very disappointed with the author when she had Melinda tell her art teacher in the end. If she wouldn't tell anyone about it before, why would she tell her art teacher? It was her fault she was so unpopular in the first place, she secluded herself to much. I just think the ending should have been better."
4,the dying tree in the art world,"i really love this book becase it teachs me about the real world not being perfect. so i should accept it and try to make my life happily. i think "" speak"" is not suit only children but also gives adults good idea. Cut dying part for survive. "" Here we are is not the perfect world"""
3,Speak,"Speak by Laurie Hales Anderson is the story of a girls first year in high school. But after an incident over the summer her friends have ostracized her. Finding herself all alone her life starts in a downward spiral, and she talks less and less. Her only escape is a closet and art class.This is a fairly well written book. For anyone who wants to remember their high school years this is a great book for you. The main characters sense of humor is apparent with constant sarcasm being expressed at the other ""clans"".This review was made by Brian Siburt."
4,My Chance to Speak,"The novel Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, is a wonderful novel for all ages. It is about Melinda Sordino, a freshman in high school and tells us her story as she struggles through life's complications. Melinda has been blamed by her classmates for calling the police on a party last summer. Because of this, all of Melinda's friends have left her in the dust. As the story unfolds, the reader sees Melinda's reasons for her actions. She becomes silent. She becomes an outcast. But soon, she will have her chance to speak. I recommend this book to those seeking a good read. I enjoyed this novel greatly, and I hope the next reader will too."
3,Speak Review,"The novel, Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson is an interesting book about Melinda Sordino, a teenager trying to overcome the challenges she faces during her first year of high school. After facing a traumatic experience during the summer, she is now an outcast. All of her friends have found cliques and nobody wants to invite her to join theirs. Through her witty sarcasm and provoking thoughts, readers learn about her emotional scars and deep wounds that she bears inside. As the year progresses, Melinda works on opening up and facing her feelings through her artwork and other activities that she occupies her time with.The book is a quick read and enjoyable for teenagers and adults."
4,Speak is for all ages,"Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson, is a book about a girl who is trying to get through her first year of high school and having to overcome many problems. The summer before her freshman year, Melinda called the cops on a party. Because of this, all of her friends left her for different cliques and she is now an outcast. Throughout the story we learn of Melinda's terrifying reason for this phone call.I liked this book because it is a darkly humorous novel about a girl finding herself and getting through the hard times with the help of a teacher who shows her that she has a lot to say. I suggest speak to people of all ages."
4,Speak,"Laurie Halls Anderson captures the true lives of teens in high school everywhere in her novel Speak. It is an incredibly inspirational novel that allows the mind to smile, laugh, cry, and sympathize with Melinda Sordino, as they go trough the freshman year of an outcast teen with a secret.Laurie Halls Anderson does an amazing job or revealing exactly what high school is really ""all about."" It's a great book for teens everywhere, giving incite to those feelings and places some of us have never been."
4,Speak: Not What I Expected.,"When I picked up Speak, I thought I would be reading a book that would take me through a rollercoaster of emotion. I believed it would be a heart-breaking story of the young girl named Melinda. This, however, was not the case. I was surprised by the humor that took me from one page to the next. At some points, I even found myself laughing out loud. It was interesting to read about something so tragic but have it laced with humor. I really enjoyed the book. It was interesting and continually hooked me. I never wanted to put it down. Melinda is such an interesting person and the way she deals with her situation is also intriguing. It is well written and has a great flow. I would suggest this book for young adults ninth grade and up. I think it is a little out of the realm of middle school kids. I definitely enjoyed it and would gladly suggest it to others."
4,The Hidden Voice,"""Speak,"" by Laurie Halse Anderson is a very serious and melancholy story about a freshmen high school girl, and a summer experience she will never forget. The novel is so realistic that it makes the reader realize how crazy the world is nowadays, and how careful teens need to be. Female teenagers are under the impression that nothing will happen to them.""Speak"" gives a true reality check, and helps the reader learn to speak out to get help and not keep everything bottled inside."
4,Good Read,"I bought this book for my daughter to read in the future, as she is a bit young now. Though being an avid reader, I had to buy. I loved how Ms. Halse made the connection between Maya Angelou's personal experience and the protagonist, who finally braves up to ""speak."" Initially, I wanted to put the book down because I thought it was a little choppy from the writing style but it fell in line with not only the character, but with the thought patterns of young adults. Reflecting on my own years in high school, this is the kind of girl you sit beside in class, where those around them are unable to discern the root of their so-called strangeness. It is good to hear relevant issues being addressed in young adult fiction because Halse has certainly addressed the time we are living. Thank you, Ms Halse."
4,A Pretty Good Book by Job David P3R4,"This is about a girl named Melinda Sordino. She is new at the Merryweather High School. She does not have any friends or have cool teachers. At the end of summer, she stood in the middle of a drunken crowd and she called 911 because she needed help. So her old friends won't talk to her, and people she doesn't know hate her from a different. The safest place for her is to be alone, inside her own head. But thats not safe because there's something she's trying not to think about, something about the night or the party that, if she let it in, would blow her carefully constucted disguise to smithereens. And then she would have to speak the truth.This book is very exciting."
1,Speak review,"SpeakLaurie Halse AndersonReviewed by: Alex RohrLaurie Halse Anderson's book Speak is not a very good book. I would not recommend it to anyone who doesn't like to read female driven novels. This book was not at all geared towards guys and therefore hard for me to relate too.The story is about a girl who is an outcast from the very start of her freshman year at high school. She is an outcast as result of something that occurred during the summer right before school started. It is a relatively accurate view of teenage life but it was not the kind of book I enjoy. She is a very unhappy girl who speaks very little. This was depressing because Melinda, the main character, was always sad and alone. If she had sought help for her problem, her life would have been a lot easier."
1,BORING!!!,"Speak is one of those books that you keep reading thinking it will get better. Thinking you will finally reach the climax. Well, there is no climax, and it definetly doesn't get any better. There is no plot to this story. Speak is written through the eyes of a teenage outcast. It is in the form of her journal. If you like books that don't follow a story line and have no definite point, you will love this one. By the end you are tired of hearing this girl complain. I definetly do not recomend this book to anyone! I give it two thumbs down."
1,AWFUL,"Ok maybe because i was forced by my english teacher to read this book, it shafted my view, but this is seriously the most awful book i have ever read. Melinda is a depressed freshman, and doesnt know how to deal with it. she thinks about suicide and constantally dis's other people at her school. Yes she did get raped, but other people have gotten raped and delt with it in other ways than that. Basically my whole class thought that this book was terriable. It was written well, but after the first half you knew what was going to happen. The only thing that i did not understand is how no one noticed anything. I mean she cut her self and constantally skipped shcool and didnot talk. This is where her parents, classmates, etc should have noticed something. Yes they did hater her, but her ""best friend"" should have notice something and so should have ehr teachers. This book sucked and was unrealistic."
1,Speak,"Speak is a good book. There is excitement on almost every page. Every page is filled with a new complication every time the main character, Melinda Sordino, turns the corner. Sometimes the book seems a little boring but the author, Laurie Anderson, makes her writing flow so that the reader never gets bored. This book is well written and states a universal theme. It tells of struggle and tells of fighting for what you believe in. I found the writing style to be rather interesting and unique. It was almost diary format, with random thoughts and tangents thrown in along with the story. I recommend that anybody should read it."
1,Amazing Book,"I loved this book!! It was a great book for a teen, like me and it kept me interested the whole way through!! I will always read this agian!! Any teen would like this book!! i did a book report on it and my teacher loved it!! It was very interesting!!!"
1,Speak,This Book was a book that I could not even finish! It was too descriptive and had terrible language. I can not believe that any YOUNG ADULT should be reading it.
5,Speak,"At first I wasn't sure I was going to like this book, but I did.Is heartbreaking yet funny at times, a girl struggle to find her own voice after ""someone"" did ""something"" that made her thought it was better to keep quiet. Rich in symbolic content I highly recomend this book.Go on, read..."
4,Ali's Review,"Although you might have heard the same old story before, a teenager gets drunk and raped at a party; Speak captures the emotion and feeling in a way that will keep you turning pages. Anderson's characters are believable and ones you can connect to. They're in high school going through the same things all teenagers are; friends, boyfriends, grades, parties. The story, told through the character, Melinda's, point of view, puts you right in her shoes. With Anderson's details and diction, you feel Melinda's feeling and think what she's thinking. The plot keeps you on your toes wondering what's going to happen next. It unveils Melinda's shocking truths and secrets. It is a good book that everyone should read because it has a strong message to all teenagers."
3,OK book,"The book Speak takes place in a school setting. It basically talks about the different types of groups there are in school like the cheerleaders, jocks, ect... When something happens, the characters life is suddenly changed forever.I enjoyed this book because you can relate it to your own life. Everywhere you go you are always going to be faced with decisions to make. The thing I didn't like about it was this girl chooses not to talk over an incident that took place. It was very frustrating knowing that she wanted to hold this in, instead of tell someone. If I were this girl I would have talked a long time ago. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries. The book has a touching side to it that will allow you to figure out what is going on and why the character is acting the way she is."

4,summer party gone wrong,"As a studnt i feel that the book overall was good. Its the story of a girl who busts a party at the end of summer. This action made her immediatly an outcast. As the school year begins she forgets that she doesnt have any friends trying to confront them in the gym she fails an they shun her. Melinda trys to explain why she called the cops but every one thinks its a lie untill ""it"" wants to... her agin in a janitors closet. By then the school year has ended and the who school feels sorry for her."
5,Speak,This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. This book is for muture teenagers and adults.its about a girl going through high school being a geek because she called the cops for a party. but no one really knows why she called the cops. the author gives you hints for why. but you find out why around the end of the story.
5,speak,This book is well written and states a universal theme.It tells of struggle and tells of fighting for what you beleive in.
4,Secrect Lies,"Speak is an excellent book. Speak is about a girl who has a terrible secret and doesn't tell anyone. Melinda Sordino goes to an end of school year party at her friend Rachels house. Something happens at that party. She has to call the cops. No one will ever talk to her again, but what happened? At school her grades get worse and worse, she gets in major trouble at school. Is it because something at that party happened? She will not tell anyone, because everytime she trys to talk her throat tighten and her lips crack. The only place she can think is in her own head. Later on in the story a shocking secret is revealed that reveals what happened at that party. What is the secrect you might ask? I recommend you to read this stoy to find out! This was an excellent stroy, i could read it again and again."
5,speak,"I loved this book. Laurie Halse Anderson does an excellent job with capturing a troubled teenagers life. I was so surprised when I came to the end, and really learned why her life as a freshman was so bad. Her best friends left her, she was scared and couldn't talk to anyone. If anything like that had happened to me I dont know what I would've done. I really liked how Ms. Anderson showed Melinda's life style and what she thought, also her perpesctive of IT. Highschool is full of new things and changes and I think that she captured that life extremely well. I was so drawn into this book i couldnt put it down! Im glad that it was recommend to me... if I had never heard of this book I'd definitly be missing out. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a great book!"
1,Speak :(((((((,"i have to read this book for school and oh my i can't wait until its over, it kills me, im so bored reading it, i have a test over it tomorrow while my mind if flying ""out of space"" while im reading itim not finished with it yet and if i had a choice, i would never finish it....it's so boring, nothing really happens in it.class after another class after another class after another school day after another school day, same thing bragging about the teachers, friends, though there is some kind of mysterie but its taking too long, i wouldn't wait to find out the mysterie if i didn't had to read it, though maybe i will come back next week to add one more star, but 99.9% that i wont happen...i wouldn't recommended this book to youi expected something totally different from it when i read the review....i mean i know that people have different tastes but if your my taste i wouldn't recommended it"
1,sucked,boring horrible.the descritions on this book are too long and pointless very borng.shes a whiny teenager o poor me everyone hates me.this is an account of a regular teenagers life.my parents hate me blah blah blah.god she wont shut up.it was too much of o theres and interesting part(lasts a minute)and then goes straight to hell with boring naging pathicticpity me.id hate her too if she was in my school.im in school right now and i cant stand to think that a girl like her might be here
1,The writer was pathetic and not 1 word was true!!,"This book was TOTALLY DISAPOINTING!!! I am in the popular crowd, so yes, you might say that I wasnt one to read this book, but i was in for a ride! Not one word in this book was true! Popular kids do NOT torture or humilate those who aren't popular! We have better things to do! The narrator was plain PATHETIC! She kept just feeling SORRY for herself and made other poeple give her sympathy! She wasnt willing to try new things! Instead she turned mute and criticized all other people better than her! What? She thinks we are better off? She thinks we're luckier?? People that are more popular than her have no advantages over her!! She is just too pathetic to realize it! I do not suggest this book to ANYONE because i thought it was stupid and UNrealistic!! NO TEACHER WOULD LET THERE STUDENT NOT TALK THE WHOLE YEAR!! GIVE ME A BREAK!!"
4,Great format makes this a great read,"I really like the format of this book. The book is broken down into the 4 marking periods of a school year. Then it is more like journal entires than chapters. This is great if you are always having to stop, and then pick back up later. I read ""Prom"" by this author first, and I believe that book was better than this, but overall this is a good book. Melinda is damaged. a ""freak"". But at the same time she is so ""Normal""(whatever that is these days). You'll have to read for yourself. I also reccommed Prom, by this same author."
5,Excellent read,"I first became interested in the book after seeing the film adaptation of it on TV one day as I was flipping through the channels. The character of Melinda Sordino was captivating. Soon afterwards, I bought Speak and read it in one sitting.Although this is labeled as a YA novel, I'm an adult woman and thoroughly enjoyed the novel. Anderson has written a completely realistic, heart-breaking, inspiring and at times funny portrayal of high school. Melinda is a character I could become friends with, she is that real. The rape and Melinda's reaction to it are so vividly and sensitively portrayed by Anderson. You really begin to feel the pain, despair and loneliness of Melinda as you read the first person narration of her first year of high school. If you're thinking of reading this or giving it to your teen to read, definitely do it. You won't have any regrets. I can also vouch for the movie adaptation, it was excellent and Kristen Stewart IS Melinda Sordino, no question."
4,Epitome of teenage transitions.,"I read this years ago, while I was still in high school, and at that time I could definitely see how young adults would have been able to relate. This book goes into the life of a teenager who has gotten lost somewhere in the transition of Junior High to High School due to an ultimate betrayal. It shows the insecurities and peer pressure that teens feel almost daily. In a way I think this book is about Matilda (the main character) finding her voice, pun intended, and finally being able to come to terms with what she has been through. I think this is a must read for young adults and adults alike."
3,A good book for teens and a good book for parents of teens,"I think this is a good book for teenagers to read. Those who consider themselves on the outside looking in could relate well to the main character, Melinda. I think teens could learn several lessons from this story, especially about drinking and putting yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Teenagers' minds are very complex and this story did a fairly good job of conveying that to the reader. I do think that it was unrealistic in that a teenage girl would wait that long to tell someone. Overall I would recommend the book to young adults and parents of young adults who would like to better understand teenage culture."
4,Is Speak the right book for YOU?,"Speak is about a girl named Melinda Sordina. She just started ninth grade and has no friends because at the end of the year party in eighth grade she called the cops and busted the party. In the beginning of ninth grade when she entered the gym, she saw many different groups such as: the marthas, the jocks, and many more groups. Melinda didn't sit with anyone because no one really liked her because of what happened in ninth grade. About two weeks into school Melinda met a really nice girl named Heather, They got along really well. Melinda doesn't particularly like the marthas because she said they must shop together because they always where the same clothes as each other.In her school they get graded on many different subjects then what we normally get graded on, such as; Socail life, Lunch, Clothes, Social Studies, Biology, English, Spanish, Algebra, Gym, and art. Melinda has to make friends, and she said that she must get involved with the School."
5,This book was great.,This book was so great. I read it in one night. i couldnt put it down. i also did this book as my summer reading project and i got a 100 on it. i can just understand with what goes on. it was great.
5,Heartbreaking.,"I have yet to read a book that hits me quite as hard as this one does. For anyone who knows someone who suffered sexual abuse, or has been through it themselves, this book is extremely relateable. I really enjoyed reading it, and highly recommend it. For teen readers who are struggling with depression or anxiety, the character is very easy to connect with."
5,Speak,"This is an excellent book that every teen should read. Melinda is quiet, bitter, and misunderstood by everyone because of what happened that summer before school started. But she learns to deal with it with somewhat dark humor, and in the end, can speak the truth."
5,the most realistic book i have ever read!,"this book was one of the best i have ever read. all of it seems very real. people who have allready been through high school can relate to some of Melinda's problems. If your in high school you can especially relate to this. Most of all if you are still waiting, like me, to expierince highschool you can appreciate the humor. even if the book is meant for high school kids i was still able to understand it. i would suggest this to anyone who feels they can understand the seriouse part of the book, also. i knew from the first time they mentioned ""IT"" what they meant, but some people wouldn't. as a guidline i wouldn't give this book to anyone under maybe 10."
5,exsquisit!!,"My freshman english teacher recomended this for me, and it was fantastic!!! I think that every high school freshman should read this book, girl or guy. Just amazing!"
5,Speak...,This Book was a very delightful book. it was very good because it was so realistic. it is about a girl who started to get all depresed and stuff. i liked this book because its so much like what could happen in real life. the story line is awesome. it also had a very good ending. you should read this book...its a very good ending.
3,Speak,"A girl is having difficulty in finding her voice throughout her first year of high school. Not being socially accepted, she struggles to fit in especially after she crashes a huge party by calling the cops. Little did everyone know, Melinda was hiding much more than just her face. Her peers torture her until the truth is revealed, soon gaining their understanding. Others learn there can be more to a person than just their appearance.This book can relate easily to any teenager who has been of the outcast. The storyline is interesting because of the ability of the mind to perceive it. The occurrences throughout the book could happen to anyone these days, especially those similar to Melinda. I enjoyed this book yet it was not my favorite. I would recommend Speak to young teens."
5,In My Top Five,"This book was recently recommended to me by two separate friends of mine on separate occasions. I absolutely loved this book. Both of my friends also said it was a ""chick book"" (I am not a girl. :-P), but I didn't see why they thought that, other than that the main character was a girl. This book is in my top five favorite books of all time, now. I loved the protagonist's dark sarcasm and ironic wit. I recommend this book to everyone that asks me what book to read, now."
5,A Great Book! A Must Read!,"This book is way to good to pass up! I have read 10 + times, and every time I see something new, different, that I hadn't seen before. Laurie Anderson's best woork yet! Speak is not just about how much one event can change your life - It also speaks about the character of people in high schools these days. The cruelty, gossip, and hate that can spread so easily. The first time I read it, I read it in one night! That's how much I loved it! You feel a bit of pity of Melinda, but by the end Melinda is like a friend of yours, and your cheering her on in the end! I recommend this book greatly! Happy reading!"
3,"A Great Book, not as good Audiobook","When Melinda calls the cops at an end of the summer party, she causes herself to become an outcast of her high school before she's even attended her first day. Taking place over the course of the school year, Melinda slowly begins to reveal what happened at the fateful party. This leads to a revelation that by design is anti-climatic as Melinda finally can begin to cope with her trauma. Anderson's prose accurately dissects the many inanities of high school, and gives us a protagonist who we like and root for, even when she doesn't like or root for herself. This is a serious book that provides no easy answers, just as one would hope, and leads to a satisfying, but hardly happy, ending.Siegfried's narration displays the requisite malaise you would expect from Melinda's first person narration. While this reading is faithful to the book it can make for dreary listening at times and thus might be one to read instead of listen to."
3,Hi Ms.Corey :),I didn't really like this book. It is all about American teenager problems. I liked the way how she tells us the story. There is nothing to not believe in this story. The story is about the high school problems and they are exactly what happens in the schools.I can say that Speak is a good book for an American teenager to read. Also adults should read this book because they can see the kinds of problems their kids face today.And I like the symbolism about the tree.
5,i loved this book,I think this book was fabulous. I couldn't put it down. I liked how she totally ditched heather. i want to read more books this good. -a 12 year old girl
4,Speak,"Speak is a good book that deals with a young girl who has been raped, but she doesnt tell anyone what has happened to her. she is an outcast at her highschool, and is depressed.Speak is written well but its depressing...although, the end is very good, i liked that."
3,Speak Review,"Speak was an okay book and was a fast read. It was a little boring; although it did teach the importance of communication. The book had vivid details that created an image in the reader's mind. Laurie Halse Anderson could have written the book at a faster moving pace because at times the book would seem overstretched. Overall the book was descriptive; although, the plot did not really sink in."
3,Three Starts,"My thoughts on the book Speak is that is a good book. It shows what some peoples life is like in High School. Some kids do not have many friends, they get teased and made fun of or they just dont have any friends at all. The book focuses on a girl that once had many friends and because of an incident at a party, she has lost her friends. It was a good book, but some parts i did not enjoy."
3,My thoughts on Speak,"My Thoughs on the books Speak is It was a pretty good bok, It was a good book to read in highschool, becuase it explains some of the things that goes on in our highschool Enviroment. I would recommmend This book to al highschoolers and soon to Be highschoolers So then can think about the stuff thats really going on in Highschool.To me the book was a little to Negative for a postive person like me. :)"
3,SPEAK,"Last summer melinda was an aver age girl, going to a end of 8th grade party. That party will change her life fore ever. Melinda has lost all her Speak the real life of a girl going to her first year in high school with a secret that is ripping her apart. Wonderfully written by Laurie Halls Anderson and a Pulitzer Prize winner.I think the book is very depressing and sad. I am not a big fan of fiction, these plots that you are unraveling like trying to undo a knot. But if you liked the scarlet letter then you'll love this book because this book has a lot of symbolism.Laurie Halls Anderson is an amazing writer, she just seems to teleport you inside melida's head. The way she tells her life through flash backs and the sybolism of trees is quite amazing,"
2,Blah,"I can honestly say i didn't like this book. The story went on for ever, even thouggh it was only 200 pages. It was boring and the characters were un-exciting. The story-line could have been so much better if the author told her secrete in the beginning instead of the very end. The idea of this girl going on and on and on about her problem and not even telling us what it is.Maybe if she said it at the beginning i wouldn't hate the charcter so much. She just sat there and let her stupid friends make fun of her and everything. If your into low-self esteem and un-exciting characters this book is for you. but if your like me and like those tough, strong and cool characters I don't recomend this book."
2,Juvenile and poorly written,"Hmm.... what to say, what to say....Okay- Speak.The plot sucked and the character was obnoxiously TYPICAL - or rather, what an adult who doesn't know thinks a teenager is.I thought that this book would be a real great story about being alone, being solitary, and depression. I was wrong. It was ""oh I'm not popular, woe is me"" type things, and the whole story about the rape is unreal and just blah.The main character lacked any real depth no matter how hard the author tried- and so did all the rest of the characters. There was no character development or development of ANY kind - yes, it has a happy ending and all is well - but there wasn't any real journey and there was no plotline to follow along with.I would only recommend this book to people searching for books featuring two-dimensional stereotypical teenagers at a high school that survives on labels.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because - at least I read the whole thing."
2,Not worth your time,"I picked up this audio book from the small selection available at my library. Reading the back cover, the premises of the story sounds interesting enough, however, once the story began, the ""interesting"" quickly disapated.Very quickly, any reader can figure out exactly what's going to happen in the rest of the book. It left for nothing interesting later on. The story is told by a freshman high-school girl who was raped during the summer by another member of her school and her thoughts and struggles from the aftermath.Very predictable. Very boring. The protagonist mostly just whines about a lack of friends, and her dislike for school and teachers.Yawn.The only good thing about this audio book was the voice of the reader. Her voice sounded like it could be that of a young girl and was very expressive.My advice? Skip this book and look for something else."
2,2 Stars,"I give this 2 stars because I am not satisfied with the product. I bought it thinking it was be in new condition, but when I recieved it, it was ripped in some places and dented on the cover and I was very disappointed"
5,A Comedy The Whole Family can Enjoy!,This hilarious romp tells the tale of a young high school girl having plenty of fun adventures and making some meaningful art along the way.The whole family will be able to enjoy this comedic story. Guess you'll just have to read it to find out how it ends!
4,Unexpected,"When I first started reading the book I though ""Oh, it's a story of a girl who broke up a party and got her friends mad."" Then I heard people talking about it and how someone got raped. I just brushed it off and was like 'Maybe it was a different book'. Then all of a sudden it's like a totally different twist where this girl is actually the vitim and no one else understands. It was a truly interesting book and a very easy read. I enjoyed it."
4,"""Speak""","Speak is a book about a teenage girl in her freshman year. She has really no friends and gets picked on a lot, but she doesn't care what people think and it's just in her own world with having friends and having no friends.My favorite part of the book is the last sentence of the book. When her art teacher Mr. Freeman asks her what's wrong and what happened and she says ""Let me tell you all about it"". I like this part the best because , she never really had anybody talk to her about her problems and how she can fix them. Now she can talk to Mr. Freeman abou it. I wanted there to be a second book and see if she makes many friends or not and if Mr. Freeman helped her with it.Speak is now one of my favorite books. It's sometimes can be boring but it really what happens in real drama in school. I do recommend this book to mostly teenagers especially the people who like real drama and like to be in it. I would read this book many times. It was a great book for me and most likely others."
4,speak,"Speak is a book that touches many social issues in today's society. High school students today face the issues of rape and peer acceptance. Anderson uses these issues of our times in an emotional story of a young girl's self-growth. The theme is one of self-growth and self-worth. The story is written in first person, which allows the reader to experience Melinda's emotion's through her words and actions. Anderson's use of the tree is symbolic in this story. Melinda connects the idea of cutting off the unhealthy parts of a deseased tree to her own life. By the end of the year she has gained the confidence to speak about the rape."
3,Speak,"This book was a fairly good book. I like how the book starts of how Malinda is surviving of being an outcast. Later in the book, it tells on how she was an outcast. I feel that at that point when the reader knows what she did and why she did it, that the book now gets more interesting and the reader wants to find out what will happen with Malinda and her friends. The also tells about life in Highschool of being an outcast. After reading the book I feel that it is terribly hard for kids today to be at school day after day, week after week, being mad fun of and tortured. I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars."
5,Speak,"I thought that the book Speak by Laurie Halse was very interesting with a complicated plot and a dark sense of humor. It starts with the end of summer vacation focusing on a girl who spent the last three weeks of summer lying on her couch watching ""bad cartoons"" because her reputation and popularity was ruined when she called the cops and broke up a high school party. Her name is Melinda Sordino and she starts high school with no hopes and a secret. This book is all about how she survives her high school career. It deals with everything from relationships to skipping school. To find out how Melinda made it through her freshmen year of High School and to find out what her secret was read this book."
4,Speak---Great Story for Teenage Girls,"Melinda Sordino is considered to most people in the beginning of the novel, SPEAK by Laurie Halse Anderson, as an outcast, freak, and a loner. She struggles to fit in high school. She tries to figure out why she's the way she is and she learns a few things about herself and others. She was hated for ruining a party by calling the cops, but they don't know the truth. She tries to show herself through her artwork and starts to confide to her art teacher Mr.Freeman. I enjoyed this novel for having to deal with the book's topic. I highly recommend this book, especially to teenage girls."
5,Speak.,This was a very interesting book. i enjoyed it very much. its also a good way to convince kids to speak up about problems in their life.
3,An okay read,"Laurie Halse Anderson's book, Speak, was a book that dealt with emotional issues, and high school problems. In my opinion, this book was very slow, yet at times it was hard to put down. The main character, Melinda, struggled through a very hard problem which is a big surprise at the end, but I thought it was too boring for me. I would suggest this book to someone who enjoys a book that deals with teen struggles. Overall, I would give Speak three stars."
5,A treat for your Soul!,"I've just recently read this book, and despite the fact that I'm an older reader(not that old) I one-hundred-percently loved this book. If you love historical fictions and stories with a touch of everthing you will absolutely love this book. I think that this is definitly one of the best classics ever. It really shows how people feel in different situations. And it's a sweet treat for your soul."
5,Everybody Should Read This Book,"This book is great. Everyone should read. In the book the Kit sails to America after she must flee here home. She moves to America real close to the time of the American Revolution. There she finds life hard because where she used to live she had slaves and people were not as judgemental and shall I say more free spirited(in a way)and in America people seem to be very conservitive, while Kit is not and has a hard time dealing with the conservitive and judgemental people of the colonies. Many problems arise in the story and Kit is somehow twisted into all of them. The book may start a little slowy but soon becomes fast paced and a great read. The best ages to read this is the Junior High and High School Ages. Great for teachers, they can mix social studies and Language Arts together."
5,humanity revealed,"Watching this film for the first time on tv, i remember how unique it was. The vulnerability of the regimental british soldier is displayed in peacetime. How sober an exploration. I can understand why Sir Guinness believes this display his greatest acting endeavor. He revealed his absolute genius in a remarkable film: Tunes of Glory."
3,tunes of glory,"Generally very good but was disappointed that substantial parts of the movie had been cut out. If the movie is too long to be accommodated on one disc we should be warned before purchasing same, or you should make it on two discs."
5,"""Ev'rybody say 'WHAM!'""","This is where it all started. This is the album that made me fall in love with the 'Boys from WHAM!' Althought they would not top the US charts until their next LP, this one still remains my favorite. Featuring the club classics ""WHAM! Rap (Enjoy What You Do)"", ""Young Guns (Go For It)"", ""Club Tropicana"", and the minor US success ""Bad Boys"", this album never lets the party end.Besides the four brilliant singles, the album features the Motown classic ""Love Machine"" (a former hit for the Miracles) as well as the WHAM! classic ""A Ray of Sunshine"", probably one of George Michael's better pieces of work to date. This album is a must for anyone who loves the party music of the 80's, and for those of us who lived though the era, welcomes a happy return to days where things were so much brighter (could be the florescent colors we all wore back then!!)."
4,Whamtastic?,"There is always a song or two I don't care for on a Wham! album. ""Come On"" is that track here. But ""Wham Rap"", ""Club Tropicana"" and ""Young Guns"" are some of the good songs here. ""Bad Boys"", ""A Ray Of Sunshine"" and (maybe surprisingly) ""Love Machine"" follow suit. The sole ballad here ""Nothing Looks The Same In The Light"" is a stripped but soul-stirring performance. It with ""Wham Rap"" are my favorites here.I must say after listening to it a couple of times over I do enjoy this CD more when before I was underwhelmed with some of the tracks. It's funny how the mind changes...4.3 stars."
1,not the one,"Although the third edition, ISBN 073561265X, was published 3/7/2001, there is still not a whisper about Windows XP in the book. Very much the best book on the subject is Scott Mueller's, ISBN 0789729741."
4,Oldie but still a goodie,The information in this book is a little outdated for 2008-2009. But the basic's are clear. The book is easy to read for novices. A good tool for those with little experience. A good guide for repairing and rebuilding old PC's.
3,Good but not enough...,"Hey all.. this book is a really good resource for the exam, but for sure it is not enough, cuz it doesn't cover the new 2003 objectives such as WinXP in the OS section and many other things in the core section.. I passed the tests using this book as one of my study materials, as well as the Microsoft Readiness Review and A+ Exam Cram, A+ Exam Prep (useful for WinNT), and Macaraft PrepLogic 4th edition, and still non of these books cover all of the new 2003 objectives...Good luck all..."
1,Do not buy - there is a third edition!!,"Nowhere is a potential buyer warned that there is a third edition of this book. I made the mistake of getting this book. It is a good thing that I also purchased the Readiness Review which which, to my shock, started testing me on things not even mentioned in the Training Kit. To get the most recent edition - so you do not fail the exam - get ISBN 0-7356-1265-X."
1,Misleading...,"Just ordered this booking thinking that it was the new edition shown in the picture (blue cover - in the style of all of teh new microsoft books)... upon clicking to see more images, i see that all of the images are of the older book (white cover). Now, looking further at the publication date, as some others have said, this is an old edition of the book. Pretty crappy that they're even selling it on amazon, and I don't even see the new edition for sale on here! Not overly happy that I just wasted my money..."
4,Good reference,"I just passed (January 2003) both A+ exams, using this book as one of my references. It certainly offers a different approach and unique perspective than the other A+ books. I found information in this book that is not in any of the other major A+ references; however, some of the good, nice-to-know info seems beyond the A+ objectives. I would recommend it and the Microsoft A+ Certification Readiness Review as supplements to one or more of the slim A+ Adaptive Exam books by either Meyers or Crayton. I didn't look at the info on the included CD."
2,Eulogy and Propaganda,"This eulogistic and contemporary study of Marie Corelli and her vast success reveals as much, if not more, of the writers' own personal prejudices as it does about Corelli. The writers see Corelli as a great propagandist for what is right and wrong in the world, and thus attempt to excuse or expiate her own tendency for hypocrisy and an inability to know her own mind. This is an insight into one kind of her contemporary admirers, but does her less justice than the more even handed biographies of Eileen Bigland and Brian Masters."
3,kinda small,"Kinda small, as in no time I filled it, lengthwise. But I am gaining width, now almost filling the width.Surprised my wife on our infrequent sessions, as she didnt know about this. But now she cant take it. Now I need a bigger hand in the shower....."
5,"A whole new world, and yet not all that new","This book has it all: adventure, excitement, a whole medieval world conjured up by pure genius. It also centers around a dilemma similar to that faced by various Star Trek captains: thou shall not interfere! But how does one not when so much is at stake? How can one be an equivalent of a god, but merely observe, forgetting the very notion of justice? If you like books that make you think, but do not serve up the answers, this is it! Written in a wonderful, crisp language, and one of the better Russo-English translations, this is one is a worthy undertaking!"
1,flush it down the toilet,"Too bad I have to give this movie 1 star. It's not even worth this one. It's unbelievable that trash like this is burned on a DVD. If you have the intention buying it, think about it twice. A very thin story, if I may call this a story at all, is built around some ""erotic""( ridiculous) scenes, which made me use the fast forward button most of the time. Believe me, this is a waste of money."
5,Great solution for micing a amp stack,"I wanted a way to mic the top cab of a amp stack but didn't want another boom stand. I cut a piece of 3/4"" thick MDF (if it doesn't last I'll use hardwood) to about 6"" x 12"", cut a radius on one end with a band saw and painted it flat black. I mounted this flange in the center of the radius. I added a 13"" black gooseneck and then attached my Shure SM 58 to it.I can slip the piece between the bottom Marshall 4x12 cab and my Fender Hot Rod Blues DeVille 4x10 on top and position the mic to catch one of the speakers of the Fender. Cool! It costs less than a boom stand and takes up less room. I may need to glue some sort of non-skid rubbery material on it to keep it from sliding around, but since I just use the amp rig in my home studio it'll probably work out fine as it is.The gooseneck fit perfect. It comes with 3 mounting screws."
4,Seems to work,"Straight-forward table mount. Smaller than I imagined, it has a diameter of 1 3/4.I'm a little skeptical about mounting this upside down (attached to the bottom of an overhead cabinet) with a boom mic attached using the tiny screws that came with it. It doesn't seem like the screws will hold it if you're into moving your mic around a lot combined with gravity - they are extremely small. Other than that, it mates perfectly and smoothly with my mic stand boom hardware. I'm going to use some larger screws and mount it to a piece of wood so I don't mess up my furniture."
1,Perfect 10/10,"Update to this review: Originally I scored it perfect however after five uses the threads have completely stripped out/off. This is for mobile use to it has to be disconnected from the goose-neck. I never over torqued! when I say the threads stripped off, they are not even there anymore. It is as if the threads were painted on or it is made from aluminum foil. The goose-neck threads are fine and I never cross threaded. It may work for someone threading once and leaving it, but not good for mobile use at all."
5,Great book (from a Schoolteacher's point of view),"I share this title because this is one of the best books that I have ever read! The humor is outstanding, although it is filled with tons of suspense, and a fantastic story line. A student from my fourth grade class was reading it, and left it at the front of the room for an extended period of time. Curiosity set in, and I wanted to see what my students were reading that I was not promoting (books like Hatchet, Newbery Award winners, etc). After the first chapter I was hooked! I'd put it with the class of genres such as the film, It's a Wonderful Life, and the Anthony Horwitz Alex Rider books. You should read this book!"
3,"good, but chopping writing. for me at least","the story is good, but the writing is a little choppy in it's flow. it jumps around"
4,Spooky and fun.,"Reminiscent of The Twilight Zone and told in both text and graphic novel format, How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found is a surprisingly fun read. The story is quite complex, but the quirky characters help usher the book along. The one thing this book might have benefited from is a character list as sometimes it's hard to keep track of the story. Nevertheless, HtDCaNBF was very satisfying and fun to read."
2,"Content. Five Stars ... video quality, minus three!","The advertising for this three-video set is VERY misleading ... mainly for what it DOESN'T tell you. While I feel the CONTENT of the ""three tapes"" is excellent, through no fault of the narrator the quality of the tape reproduction is AWFUL. I expected three tapes of the customary ""SP"" speed quality. What I got were three 40-minute-or-so tapes that looked like third-generation, taped in the VERY SLOW SPEED. Selling this as a three-tape set is VERY misleading. The entire program of about two hours could easily have been placed in a single cassette at the best quality/speed. The images on the slowest speed are fuzzy -- extremely so. Much detail is impossible to see. A shame for a travel tape. If I were Mr. Wallis I would SCREAM at the company that is selling three lousy tapes instead of one good one. Ripoff."
5,"""Bad Day"" turned GREAT!","This book was such a great read! I am a first grade teacher and was doing a lesson on inferences. The librarian suggested I use this book. It was such a hit!!! First we did a ""picture walk"" of the first half of the book. The children had to talk about what they thought was going on. Their responses were great. I think it was a good way to start the lesson, because they were intrigued by ""what could be going on"" They were looking at the faces of the characters and we spoke about emotions.Next, we read the book. We would stop and predict every couple of pages and they were so engaged. The ending had them in hysterics. So far, I've read it to 3 groups of 1st graders (about 60 kids) and all them loved it. They think it should have an award on it, I agree!"
4,I can just see someone coloring this book.,It looks like a coloring book at the beginning. I can see one of my students picking it up and coloring in it before they realize it isn't for that at all.
1,disturbingly boring,"My son and I suffered throught this 'unique' book during our daily story time. After skimming through it, my eight-year old mentioned that he wanted to read something else. Lucky for us, this was a library book, and since it had to be returned soon, we read it nontheless. Even the ending did not change my son's feelings after we finished. It is a very strange book, and regardless of why the crayon scribbling was needed to make the story, it was simply too difficult to get through with all of the mess."
5,I misplaced this cd and I bought another one!!!,"I listened to this CD all of the time and it just vanished. I really loved it so I bought the same one again! This is a great selection of songs, a must-have for anyone who loves good music!"
3,"OK, not amazing","This book contains great pockets for holding materials from vendors, but lacks pages for notes on certain things (like the venue). It contains some useful information, but I bet there are better one's out there. It's biggest plus is its size and compactness, which are important if you are planning a wedding from a distance and have to travel back and forth a lot, but it was irritating that there was no place to put notes on venues."
5,The Perfect Wedding Planner,I was on the lookout for a wedding organizer/planner for a couple of months. I saw this one and love it. It's detailed so as not to forget the important little things of the wedding. I highly recommend it.
1,Not that great,"If you are looking for something to help you keep all the information for a big event like a wedding, this book is just not it. If you are looking for something like a keepsake, then this is what you are looking for. There is no place to keep information while you are actually planning the wedding. I wish I would have bought something else."
4,Fun to play!!!,"I bought this set for my daughter's play kitchen, although we bought a set at pottery barn kids I wanted something a little smaller and lighter since the pottery barn set was slightly heavy (but great quality). This set is pretty cute, my daughter takes out all her pots and pans and arranges them just like mommy's ""real"" set. It is bigger than what you would find at the local toy store."
3,Not as promised,"I purposely chose this product because it was clearly stated that this was an actual set that could be used for cooking. It is, however, just a toy size set and not really for any type of older child's cooking experience. It is durable but I think it should be clearly stated that it is really a toy."
4,OWL SHIRT,"DOESNT SHIP WITHIN 24 HOURS, I ORDERED OTHER THINGS SAME DAY WITHOUT THEM SAYING SHIPS WITHIN 24 HOURS AND RECIEVED THEM BEFORE THIS ITEM. IT WAS THE LAST TO ARRIVE BEFORE X-MAS. OTHER THAN SHIPPING, ITEM IS WHAT I EXPECTED!"
1,This terrible ending is so not worth it.,"I thought this conclusion would be worthwhile but it isn't what I expected it to be. For instance it needs more reusable characters, and I still hate how Electra's brother is still dead after all that. I also hate how humans are created in this show. I was hoping things would start all over right again but it didn't. I'm sorry, I am very sensitive when it comes to watching movies, tv shows, and anime and I get pretty disturbed easily sometimes. I'm sorry but I don't really reccomend how disturbing it is."
1,Not that great,"Used to Fodors and Lonely Planet books, I thought I'd try this one as it came so highly recommeded. I found it to be disorganized, with an awful index. There was very little history or neighborhood information that I'm so used to with the other travel books. It also doesn't keep restaurants, museums, hotels, etc. separate in the listings; it's very easy to miss stuff. Some of the restaurants have their logo above their review, which makes me wonder if some of them paid for placement. When we got to New York, we left the book in the hotel room and successfully relied on advice from the concierge, cabbies and just wandering around. Personally, I'd recommend Lonely Planet or Fodors!"
5,Just a little dab'l do ya,"You truly will not believe how little of this product you need to get the job done. When I first used it, I dispensed a rather large amount of foam on my sponge thinking ""this is only foam, I'm sure it's not going to wash much."" Boy, was I wrong! I finished washing a whole bunch of stuff in the sink & the foam was still going!"
2,Too stiff,"I bought this since i stay with a family, and my own cello playing drives me up the wall. I found it too stuff and am worried about my bridge collpasing. It doesnt help too much with the sound either."
3,"Good orchestral mute, not so much.....","Well, it certainly wasn't a practice type mute. My house mate could still hear me practicing in her room across the hall. It is equivalent to a normal orchestra mute. If i needed another orchestral mute, I would like it. Not so good for practicing with other people in the same area as you. But I needed a mute that wouldn't allow my house mates to hear me practicing late into the night. I ended up returning it. At least I tried it, and now I know."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I purchased this CD after listening to several of these on Pandora. Sneeky Peet is my favorite. Van Gelder has a bit of a different take on Charles Johnson's rags than Sue Keller, whose renditions I believe are excellent. A bit slower and more serious. I would have given this five stars but the quality of the recording is a bit off. However, if you like Charles Johnson's rags, or ragtime in general, this is definitely a CD you will like in your collection."
3,Very simple but generally good story,"When I first heard of this movie's general plotline, I thought it would be obvious and filled with cliches and, well, I was right. The story about a man going ""back"" to a high school baseball game to see what his future would look like if he hit a homerun hardly sounds new. However James Belushi, with his easygoing charm, and the rest of the cast can't be beat. Predictable as the story may be, it still has some very funny and even touching moments and is great if you're looking for a movie which doesn't involve much thinking."
2,sticky sweet,"Interesting premise, gets bogged down in complete fantasy. Not even believable for what it is. Second half of the movie is out right ludicrous, with stale pollyannish dialogue. Belushi is one of the rare lights in this dim bulb of a film."
5,This is a movie you can watch over and over,"This is a real sleeper, I found it late one night on HBO or showtime, John Belushi is great and with supporting actors like Michael Cane, this is a great movie, leaves you feeling good about life!"
4,Great movie!!,"If you like to watch good comedy, this is not the one you want to miss. The only reason for me to give it a 4-star instead of 5 is the story could be a little better as my logical thinking conern, that's all."
5,Warms your heart but makes you laugh.,"This humorous movie delivers a message that certainly makes you think about the important things in life. It also makes you think of events, though trivial, that deflect life in different directions. You might not truly want those things you wish for. I hope they will re-release this simple and wonderful movie."
2,Disappointed,"I usually review movie content before purchasing. However, this was an older movie and I was not able to get a good review. We tried it and were disappointed in the language that was used. There were too many bad words that we had to turn it off."
2,Two Roads Diverged at Renaissance Field,"""Mr. Destiny"" has a worthy theme, an excellent cast and a smooth progression, but I struggle to remember any character or scene that moved me deeply. It is like a soap bubble--amusing, attractive but ephemeral. It isn't bad. With Jim Belushi's easy-going charm and an outstanding group of supporting actors, how could it be? My favorite scene involves one of those supporting actors (Maury Chaykin) and Belushi in a hilarious negotiation over paving the driveway. ""There's a mud guy?"" And the movie can make us think about how we wistfully look back at the choices and events of our lives, but I think other stories (""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Back to the Future"", ""Frequency"") or poems (""The Road Not Taken"") do a much better job of that. The movie is rated PG-13 for profanity, some thematic elements and a lingerie-clad love scene."
3,"Mr. Destiny, Belushi","Not my favorite James Belushi movie, but still enjoyable. LIked The Return of Max Dugan and K-9 better! Love James Belushi though!!"
3,Lukewarm Tea...,"This is the most tea-drinking-est mystery I've ever read!I'm not being flippant with that remark though: what the problem is with this novel is that it's predictable,un-exciting, and filled with artifice. The central device is the characters-in-a-box setting: in this case, it's an artists' colony in Woodstock. But so what? The characters are all types, not personalities: they could be anywhere, isolated and unable to leave. The murder is of a beautiful young authoress, who had the secret lowdown on the murderer, of course. Untangling the past is up to Claire, the heroine and visiting writing instructor. Claire has a Greek-chorus-friend in the audacious child Meredith and a potential lover in the spiritual, wise Indian guide named Two Joe. It takes countless cups of tea, insights from Meridith and solace from Two Joe before mystery is resolved in this mildly amusing but all-too-predictable novel."
2,Battery does not last very long.,"I am very disappointed in this battery, because the charge does not last for even an hour. I keep having to recharge it."
4,Works,I only rated it a 4 because the laptop can not decide how long it will last it jumps between 1h 40min to 3h 57min at full charge.It last about 3 1/2 hours.
3,Lets see how long it will last,I got this battery for my Dell Inspiron 6000 as my original batter was dying. Iam hoping that this product lives up to all the 5-STAR reviews. I charged the battery for a whole night but for some reason when i disconnect by power connection the battery charge indicator shows the charge level at 75%. I recharged it again but it still shows as 75%. Not sure if it is a faulty indicator or the battery only charges till 75%.I will update the review once i test it for a month. I hope it last for atleast a year.
1,Laptop battery,"Bought this ""Dell"" laptop replacement battery as a gift for a visiting relative. After a 24-hr charge, battery didn't work. Sent it back, got a refund; I'm satisfied."
2,Did no last long..,"I purchased this battery on February 19, 2011 for my Dell Inspiron 9400 E1705 and completely died without any charge left around the 1st Week of May. After 2 hours use I needed to re-charge it, which is probable about right for a 17"" screen. I just wish it lasted longer than 2 1/2 months."
3,OK for th price.,This is an OK replacement battery for the Dell Inspiron 6000. I've purchased two of these. The first one lasted two years the second battery replaced that one about a month ago. I paid $25 bucks each time. The battery did not have any abrupt failure but the run time gradually decreases from about 2 hours to a little under and hour. When the run time gets that short its time to start shopping for a new battery.If you look around you will find Dell replacement batteries for upwards of $90. Why pay that much when you can get two years worth of use for $25? I doubt if the $90 battery would last 6 years which is what you would get if you bought three of these.
5,Still good 9 months later,"Nine months after putting this into my Inspiron 6000, it still works well. Somewhere over 3 hours per charge, although I have not done a complete rundown since its first week."
5,dell laptop battery,"quick shipping, item as described - i'm hoping that battery life isnt going to be an issue but for the price i cant really complain if it is"
1,Defective,"I was so happy to get my battery on time with the expedited shipping that i paid for, however the battery never fully charged even after hours it stayed at 56% and now after leaving it charging overnight and unplugging it i am gettin the low battery notification on my laptop!!"
5,Great so far,I got this as a replacement battery. The price was good and the product has performed well for the last two months. No complaints
1,DON'T DO IT !!!!,The product is garbage... I charged the battery for a few days before even thinking of using it and it lasted maybe an hour. My laptop would only work while plugged in. A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!
1,Defective/ False Advertisement,I thought I was buying a Japanese Dell Inspiron 6000 battery. Nope. It's Chinese made Dell Inspiron 6000 WITHOUT serial numbers to check the status of the battery. Not placing this defective product in my laptop not knowing it'll cause a fire.
1,Dead at 6 months,"I bought this battery a little over six months ago. I worked fine (even great) for at least four months, but as I don't use my laptop unplugged very often, I can't say when it stopped working well. However, in the last few days it's stopped holding a charge. At all. If the cord on my laptop gets bumped the computer shuts down catastrophically, which even my original 5-year-old Dell battery didn't do-- least that still held a charge for 15 seconds. Definitely listen to other reviewers and avoid this item."
1,junk,"This item was advertised to work for a Dell inspiron 6000. It DOES NOT!! The Sunvalleytek company representatives did a very poor job of comprehending my complaint, although it couldn't be simpler. I'm not convinced that they speak English well. After almost a month of emailing back and forth, they still do not understand or believe me. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!! Also, read their return policy very carefully. It states, ""be sure of what you write"" and ""all products will be tested."" If you say it does not work, they can turn right around and say it does, without providing any proof. Then of course, no refund. Buyer, beware."
1,STAY AWAY,"Purchased this battery 2 and a half years ago for a laptop that I very rarely use. In fact, I probably used it for about 20 hours since I put the new battery in. It held a charge for about 18 of those 20 hours. I cleaned all the contacts on the battery and the laptop to see if maybe some dirt had affected the ability to charge the battery and then left it on to charge overnight (with the computer off). I woke up the next morning to a melted battery. As I said the computer was powered down and was sitting on a desk (not carpet). There was no reason why it should have generated that much heat. There's no damage to the computer aside from the battery. It's pretty clear these are cheap knockoffs, so I'd steer clear."
1,It is already prepared to be in the garbage,this battery has only 3 months and it's already dead. doesn't charges. it's dead. Won't buy it again or think more than twice before you do it!!!!!!
5,Awesome battery,"This Dell replacement battery is outstanding. I have used it for several months now and I would say it performs as well or better than the original Dell battery. Very pleased, what a great price compared to a battery from Dell."
3,Not Great,This battery worked well for the first eight months and then lost power very quickly. I would not recommend it.
3,laptop battery,"Easy to install , fit and connection were good. holds charge for short time off of hook up to electric."
1,lithium laptop battery,"the new replacement battery failed to accept charging, we have two dell inspiron 6000, using thesame charging unit, so we know it is not the charger. We contacted the shipper MLC, was toldto E-Mail a request for replacement, or refund, well we did ask for replacement, and followthe instruction as requested by MLC, it was October 12,2012 as of today October26 they did notresponded back, so we have to use our unit plugged in to the wall outlet"
5,WELL-CRAFTED MUSIC FOR KIDS!,"It is so refreshing to hear intelligent musical arrangements, and unique song writing. The artist is versatile as evident by the different musical styles. Some songs can be meaningful and others completely wacky. If you ever get to see this guy perform you can witness how he locks into the mindset of children, and engages them from start to finish. This is a future heirloom that my kids will play for their kids. Terrific!"
1,"Unorganized, Too Wordy, and Confusing","The information is not coherent and is scattered all over the place. Points that could be made in one sentence are stretched out over many paragraphs. Furthermore, the usage of words are often inappropriate in many cases (looks like the authors just ran a thesaurus check) which makes the text very confusing. This book is definitely not recommended for someone without a background in Virology."
1,"Extremely basic, but hard to follow","This text was a real disappointment to me. Having taught microbiology for a number of years and looking for something to expand my understanding and knowledge of the field of virology, I was sorry that I added this book to my reference library. All in all, I found it to be poorly written and only slightly informative; at least from my perspective."
4,FISH ARE HAPPY,Well so far so good. I have a bigger tank and food that I bought at a major pet store. Created an algea bloom in the tank. I have never seen the like before. I have had tanks and this one for years. The fish didn't care. So I totally changed the filteration system.
3,Larry Graham DVD review,"If you think that this is an instructional DVD--it is not. There are no frame-in-frame closeups showing Larry's playing techniques. This is a video of Larry playing a few tunes in a studio with a couple of his old bandmates. If you're into that, the DVD is interesting.If you expect some guidance concerning funk bass playing, you will be very disatisfied. For funk bass instruction try the Francis Rocco Prestis (Fingerstyle Funk - VHS only) and Alex Sklarevski (Slap Bass) videos..both are great."
1,Keep your money,"If you are looking to see Larry Graham in concert or just on stage DO NOT purchase this DVD. On the other hand if you want to see/hear Larry Graham and one of the band's former members reminiscing in a home studio, then this DVD to get."
2,Read the fine print,"The initial description line says 'paperback' and not until the very bottom lines does it say it's the book formatted onto a cd. It would be much easier to have the printed book in hand while you are looking under the hood of the vehicle than trying to skim through the cd. Guess that's what I get for not reading the entire description, so my fault."
5,Excellent,"I wanted to hang up four of my guitars on my wall and went ahead and purchased this. Shipping was smooth and trouble-free, and the product is extremely sturdy and well built. Remember that if your guitar has an asymmetrical headstock, because it can twist, it can still be hung up in the perfect position. Personally, I didn't have much use for the rubber bits at the end to ""secure"" my guitar, so to make taking guitars on and off easier I just didn't use them. I highly recommend putting on a long piece of wood on the wall, and then putting the hangers on that if you want to hang multiple guitars side by side which is what I recommend. Holds up my bulky basswood/maple Spector bass with no problem. Great product."
1,Never received this,"After expecting this product to arrive for several weeks, I never received it. So, needless to say, this was a worthless attempt at getting a good book."
2,The Shield,"The music was very dissapoiting. All rap and songs of violence. They play fantastic music on the show, but little of ot showed up on the CD."
1,Terrible,"Wow this soundtrack is horrible. Not the great music you might remember from the series. I really only wanted the title track. No wonder Amazon makes you buy the whole album--it would never sell otherwise. Don't waste your money, your time, or your ears."
2,Black Label track seems to have been replaced.....,"All in all, a fine soundtrack if The Shield series is one of your things. However, on my cd copy, purchased by an independent seller through Amazon and fulfilled by Amazon in December 2010, track 3, Death March by Black Label Society, has been replaced by some non-BLS junk filler song. This probably violates a couple false advertising and copyright laws along the way, and it seems like I'm stuck with dealing with it for the time being. Caveat emptor, etc."
1,Disappointed,"They didnt include all the best music that Vic and Shane listen to in their cars: Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band, Jonny Lang, Blue Mountain, etc. Somewhat disappointing, was hoping to find out who some of those bands were that were playing in the backround of the car scenes."
3,Does anyone actually have a list of all the songs in all episodes?,"I love so much of the music from the show, but as was said in another review, there's so many great songs that aren't on the soundtrack. If anyone knows them by episode and name, could you please post them here? Specifically, from Episode 104 Dawg Days, (the heavy metal/rap song blasting from the crashed drive-by car that hit the litle kid {singer sounds like the rapper from Cypress Hill, the one that's not B-Real}) & also the songs from Episode 105 Blowback, (the heavy metal/rap song {sounds like the Cypress Hill guy again} the Strike Team's listening to in the barn while getting ready for the Armenian coke bust, and also the bluesy instrumental song at the end of the episode, when Vic's at Danni's Door.) Thanks,-Shane"
2,Not what I expected.,"The name Alea Jacta Est is not a real common name, but I'm wondering if its the same band I was looking for. I would have associated Alea Jacta Est with the Darkwave Avant Garde style of the early 1990's French group ""Lucie Cries"" or the various compilations ""L'Appel De La Muse, Vol.1, 2, 3"" etc.This album is not even close, rather it more resembles the late 1970's style of power guitar, bass and drums. Bluesy? Maybe a little. Pink Floyd? Hardly.This release may appeal to people who enjoy listening to FM radio, or the more mainstream rock music going around. That's why I gave it two stars and not one. However, if you're looking for the unusual, experimental, sophisticated sound of a French Darkwave band, stay very far away from this release."
2,Hymns,I ordered 2 ea. of hymns for a kids heart. One of them had the cd but the most expensive one did not come with the cd.. So disappointing
5,Great tool for a kid's choir,"&#65533;Thank you for Hymns for a Kid&#65533;s Heart. It is beautiful in every way. The singing on the CD is so well done&#65533;it is a fine example of quality children&#65533;s singing as well as literature. I am planning to incorporate the book into the Children&#65533;s Choir program at FPC this fall. I will include the cost of the book in the children&#65533;s activity fee. The teachers will then use that book as their Bible study portion of the rehearsal. The following week, the particular hymn they studied will be a part of the worship service! I think it will be a great way to give the children insight into God and into the people who put our faith into music. Thanks again."""
2,Kid's Heart Review,"Beautiful quality book, but would not interest my grandsons. May be more of a girls choice."
1,Do not buy! Total Junk,"I received this as a gift. First, the batteries are hard to install (and this is coming from a true gadget guy!) Second, the cars barely worked. And when they did work, the wheel came off on one of the cars. True junk. I cannot believe this is an Imaginarium product. For shame!"
1,This is the worst car,"this is the worst midget car. when i herd about the zipzaps at rdio shack they were alot better. even u have to wait on the waiting list who cares. so go to radioshack to buy zipzaps, they are the best."
2,Megatech Remote Control Car,This was a bad purchase for me. I don't think the cars worked that well. They weren't as reactive as others and I would only purchase this if it it is for a very young child who is just learning remote control.
2,Not funny,"I am such a cover snob and this cover is horrible, but it has two of my favorite things! Stand up comedy and a murder mystery, (oh and it was free) so I had to read this book!I was so let down!! The jokes in this book were not even a little funny and the one liners and the main character were ok at best but not enough to get you anywhere near laughing. The murder mystery part of the book was also a let down. It was not good and please get someone to edit this book because it was horrible with typos, wrong words used etc!I did not hate the book but it needs a lot of work and if you are looking for a humor book or even a good murder mystery keep looking there are so many much better books out there that can give you both!"
5,Hubby loves the tees!!!,My husband loves these t-shirts. He says they are the most comfy undershirts he has ever worn. I have washed them and they still retain their shape even with wash after wash. We have only had them a month or so but they still feel just as good today as they did when we took them out of the package! Nautica t-shirts are great quality and the price was good too!
5,Nautica V-Neck Tee Shirt,"They are really soft and comfortable. I bought some for my sons and liked them so much, I bought some for myself to use as nightshirts. Perfect weight. Love them."
2,Poor,"I think this was stupid!,All this music and it wasnt even the right voices!and half of it was just 5 second songs. Like ""Oh,The dreaded clothsline""!Who wants that?Slammin' Wrestling Hits was a sure disapointment for me as well and If I had a choice now I would exchange it for all it is worth! Either Get WWF Volume 3 (Which is Great) or wait for WCW The Music Volume 1 (Coming in Late May or Early June)"
1,"A pi$$ poor cd, by a pi$$ poor cover band.","Don't be fooled when you see the track listing, the songs are not sung by the original artists, but by a 3rd rate cover band, who sound like $hit. I rather listen to a bowel movement on loop all day, then listen to this...then again a bowel movement, and this CD are one in the same. $hit, $hit, $hit."
3,Teachers Beware,"This is a very informative video and useful as a springboard to talk about racial issues in the classroom, however teachers beware that it has a rap video scene with naked women that your students will be shocked by, so you should definitely preview it first and make sure that you skip past that part when showing it to your students. Otherwise, it is definitely a very worthwhile video to show, and will help students open up about this controversial topic."
4,Interesting Book,"If you are purchasing this book, it is probably for a college class. Believe it or not, it was pretty helpful! There are lots of case studies to clarify issues brought up."
2,Blah,"I found this book difficult to read and heavy in statistics and jargon. There were so many graphs and formulas that I thought it read more like a math book. I'd prefer a simpler approach to assessment. As a teacher, you don't need the nitty gritty of testing. Don't waste your money."
4,Not exactly what I was looking for.,"I found this book to be very good for someone who is planning to train their Labrador to retrieve in hunting. I was looking for more of a family dog book, although a lot of the information in WATER DOG was very useful to me."
1,Wrong Book for the Job,"This book is over 46 years old and the training methods in it have largely been overcome with more knowledge on dog behavior, development and newer training methods which yield better results.For whatever reason there are still the stubborn die-hard disciples of this book who hold onto it and recommend it every chance they get. They also get really defensive when you suggest that the book is out dated.Please do yourself and your dog a favor and look into books by Evan Graham (Smartworks), Chris Akin (Duck Dog Basics), Amy Dahl (10 Minute Retriever), Mike Lardy (Total Retriever) or Jackie Mertens (Sound Beginnings).If you do buy this book please disregard the methods he uses for intro to gunfire (banging pans at dinner) and correcting a dog that has not been taught what to do.If you don't believe me get in touch with your local retrieving club and ask them or go to [...] and ask there."
2,Incorrect Discipline Says My Vet,"My Vet was very unhappy to see that this book suggested corporal discipline for canines. Overall, a good training guide."
2,Too harsh,"This book uses a very harsh method of training. During the whole book - he never really teaches the dog what he wants, just expects the dog to do it and the dog gets punished if he does it wrong. It does provide good basic steps for advancing your retrieves. I would not recommend this to people who are first time dog owners or who have little training experience of their own. He also uses a choke collar on a 3 month old puppy. The other good point was his explanation of puppy mental development."
4,Good Info!,Great for training our labrador retreiver. This is my second book from this author.I'm pleased with the message provided.
4,Water Dog,"The book is a little older. All the pictures are in black and white and the author likes to ramble alot before actually getting into the training. It's geared for starting a pup when they are very young and teaching them proper habits and techniques as they get older helping them to retain and become better hunters vs. starting them out older like the myth has been. Despite some of the ""rambling"", Mr. Waltors does a good job of still entertaining you and keeping your attention while waiting for the techniques to actually start. I would recommend it to anyone who is wanting to teach your new pup how to become the best while teaching you the patience and practices of becoming a great handler."
5,Instant Classic!!!,"Redcloud has been putting it down on the west coast underground circuit for years. His time has finally come with this album. Forget the fact that he has San Diego native Jayo Felony and DPG Kurupt on here flowin without any profantiy, Cloud holds this album down on his own. The guest appearences are just a added bonus.I have all of Clouds albums and would have to say that this is his best work yet. The true hip hop enthusiast would apreciate the west coast style beats with lyrics that would make Rakim's jaw drop. On top of that this album boasts the work of one of the most underated DJ's in the game, DJ Wise. Wise's scratches are drop dead amazing. Your jaw will hit the ground when you hear scratches of Hulk Hogan, yes THAT Hulk Hogan.If your reading this, it means your interested in the album. All I can say is that this ranks up there as an instant classic. I'm talking ""Bizzare Ride"" style classic."
5,christian metal music is freaking good,The dude that thinks christian metal is gay is freaking gay!!Christian metal music rocks!that works!!that one guy has had 2 much time with his mommy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,is it christian?,Is this christian? I am listeing to the cd and I like it a lot.I need to know if its christian they seen a little funny.
2,What happened?,"So yeah, I was a Demon Hunter fan when their self-titled album came out, and when Summer of Darkness came out. Then came the Triptych. First of all, the title could be referring to the fact that their cover art is all related, but I'm not exactly sure what it has to do with their music. Second, it sounds exactly like Summer of Darkness! Some people say it's sooo good, but the riffs and lyrical styles are EXACTLY the same. I hate it when a band releases a new album, and it sounds the same, just like the Coldplay album(s). I do admit that christian metal is an oddity, but their ""metalness"" is not based on religion. If ""metalness"" means challenging the norm, than ""christian"" metal bands take the cake by challenging the challengers. If you're looking to buy your first DH album, try Summer of Darkness or the self-titled album."
2,Disappointing release from what seemed to be a promising band.,"When I first heard Demon Hunter, specifically Summer of Darkness, I thought to myself: Is this possible? A christian metalcore band that is actually tolerable to listen to? What I discovered on that album, as well as their previous release, has been all but lost. Every song, every single song, is laced with very weak ""nu-metal"" garbage. Yes, the singer has a lovely singing voice, but come on. Where are the songs like ""Beheaded"" from S.o.D.? I appreciate an occassional singing chorus as is so popular with recent ""metal"" bands, but this needs to end somewhere and this release from a band I had at least a moderate amount of respect for has made that extremely evident. Much like Seether's latest, artistic quality has seemingly been sacrificed for vain attempts at higher sales. I hope that, like Seether, this new offering does poorly and the folks in Demon Hunter and their record label realize this is not what fans of metal expect."
3,A Wonder I Didn't Burst Into Flames,"Yeah, it's a wonder I didn't burst into flames after listening to this. I found this in the closing of Tower Records sell out (60% off) and I thought it was going to be power metal. Boy, was I wrong! Besides the fact that it is nu-metal (harsh shouting vocals followed by alternative clean vocals, etc.) the lyrics just turned me off.However, I must admit that the music and musicianship is pretty top notch. If I could just get past the overtly Christian lyrics and annoying vocals, I would find this a pretty good musical experience. Sorry to upset all you other reviewers, but had to get in my two cents worth.Recommended for the instrumental music."
3,S.O.D was better.,"Even though I like Demon Hunter, this album wasn't heavy enough to impress me that much. It had more singing than the other releases they had made. They said that it would be more heavier than Summer of Darkness, but it wasn't. This band is okay if you like to hear guys sing like girls. I am not like that. I don't want men to start singing like feminine boys that you see performing live concerts of sissy boy bands.The only subgenre of heavy metal with real talent, and more masculine sound is Death Metal that is about God."
2,Only because its bearable..,"Call me close-minded, I don't care.. Christian metal? come on now.. a musical style that was made on the most unholy ANTIchrist ideals and now christians think they can corrupt it? haha.. seriously though - this seems a pathetic attempt at breaking into mainstream metal to convert all us evil evil people. go back to knocking on doors for your brainwashing recruiting sessions. Consider this a warning for all you *real* metalheads - avoid the oncoming brainwashing from pityful imitation metal bands..Real metal lives on! Beware mediocre sh'ty immitations!"
1,This is ridiculous,"First of all, they suck. There is no second of all. Being metal and christian is a contradictory statement. It doesnt work like that! God is NOT REAL! I could argue that forever, but for now lets just say this cd sucks. Listen to something else. ANYTHING else. Even slipknot is better."
4,Extra's for hardcore fans,Although I have heard all the tracks I could not resist the extras this package offers. At first I passed over the acoustic tracks however overtime I come to appreciate them. The DVD is sweet. It has several music video's and a making of the Triptych album. If you do not own the standard cd I suggest getting this special edition release instead. Overall this is for the real fan with great material.
1,Total garbage metal...,"I heard the intro to a song called Not I. WTF. This is such a God forsaken rip-off of every other metal band. WTF. I Can't beleive people don't realize it's Christian music. How can you tell people to beleive in God if you sound like the devil himself. WTF. The music is un-inspiring. I've heard Slipknot make better riffs. WTF. They say their hunting demon's, but they hate demons, because they love God. WTF. These guys are not what should be concidered good metal. WTF. That's all I have to say."
1,...,"If theres one thing I can give this otherwise untalented band, its that they're sounding more like P.O.D everyday. I think thats where most ""Christian Metal"" (which is a paradox) end up at.As for this band, just read my UnderOath review. The only good metal is metal that isnt about God."
4,Shreds!!!!,"Why is it so horrible for a band to have lyrics referring to GOD instead of satan? You clowns kill me, if DH was another devil band singing about lucifer,killing,etc you would be ok, sing positive & oh they suck. DH,Underoath,Norma Jean, As I Lay Dying...ALL RAGE BROTHER!!!!I dont discriminate against Slayer,Godsmack,etc for their subject matter, why do you?"
3,"If you already own the original, don't bother...","Demon Hunter is my favourite band. Period. However, this special edition was very disappointing for me, as I already own the original release of The Triptych. It has a few extra acoustic tracks (which I never care for anyway) and some poorly remixed favourites that were perfect already. The making of was ineresting, but unsatisfying.I regret purchasing this, if not for the simple addition to my fan collection, and never even pull it out anymore.RECOMMENDATION: If you already own the original and can live without a few mediocre bonus tracks and so-so making of videos, save the cash for their next (hopeful) studio release."
4,Good cd but this is why im witing,"Good cd.Undying is the best song ive heard so far this year. Spiffy ill argue with you. You dont think God is real?""Tell me how do you know which way the wind blows?"""
5,best of christian metal!!!,"I've found out by the way,that they will be re-releasing the tryptic on Oct.31st.Hoo-Rah!this is a great CD! I love the red snake cover as well as the crows cover!!! great artwork!Great original sound that makes the band stand out from other christian metal bands If your a hard core christian music fan ,then definitly get this one!!who wouldn't like this cd, NOT I! CHRISTIANS RULE!!!"
2,Not That Funny,Eddie Murphy really isn't that funny And he does all his jokes infront of a live audience (most of the jokes) and it's annoying when you here: WOOOO or HAHAHHAHA It's just a waste of money
5,Murphy's Best Comedy Album,"This is screamingly funny from start to finish (and very politically incorrect). The best routine is a long story about a barbecue that took place when Murphy was seven years old. Murphy also does excellent imitations of Jackie Gleason, Art Carney, Desi Arnez, James Brown and Elvis Presley (singing: ""Lemonade. . .that cool refreshing drink!""). Absolutely great stuff."
5,"Your wife's a Bigfoot, isn't she Gus? GOONIE GOO GOO!","The above title is from ""The Barbecue"", one of the skits on this album/cassette/cd, and definitely one of the best comedy skits of all time. I never get tired of this. I have the cassette version and the vinyl LP version, and both are great. My favorites (I like them all) are the following skits : ""Faggots Revisted/Sexual Prime"", ""Singers"", ""Ice Cream Man/Shoe-Throwin' Mothers"", and, of course, ""The Barbecue"". I think most of these skits (or maybe all of them) can be found in the Eddie Murphy concert movie ""Delirious"". It is highly recommended!"
5,Classic Eddie Murphy,I loved it on video on cable back in the day...love it now. Brings you down memory lane!!!! Eddie Murphy at his funniest.
3,Love the watch. Hate the band.,"The watch is as advertised, very attractive, very heavy and seemingly well made.I've been wearing the watch for over four months now, however, and I've got nothing good to say at all about the band/buckle arrangement. The previous reviewer mentioned that it didn't seem strong enough - I most certainly agree. Regardless of how I adjust it, tight or loose, the buckle pops open many times during the day. I can't begin to understand why this type of clasp was seen as superior to a simple buckle. I will be replacing the band soon."
4,The pictures don't do this watch justice.. attention grabber.,"This is a beautiful watch. The picture here doesn't do it justice. It's a real attention getter. The silver face with the intricate details on the face, the original numeric design stand out.My wife gave this to me as a gift about a year ago and I have been quite happy with it. It's a tad heavier and bigger than most of the watches I've worn but it is also quite sturdy. It keeps time excellently and the I've used the chronograph a great deal.I have a number of Invictas and this one is one of my favorites. Like I said it makes a statement for originality. I once had a jeweler come all the way across a showroom to look at it.I have only one complaint and it has nothing to do with functionality. I really much prefer a normal buckle watch band as opposed to this leather band with a modified expandable clasp type. I found that to be not to my liking but that's just me. I got a leather black band with a regular buckle and I was set."
1,Don't buy this product,"I was totally disgusted with this product, the print was very small, and the audio was not loud enough."
5,The definitive 80's Miles CD,"This CD defines a whole new approach to improvisation. If you can find it, check out John Scofield's interview in Downbeat which came out shortly after Decoy was released on vinyl. It explains in depth the improvisational concept of this CD, which, for musicians, can be applied over any tune or set of chord changes. As usual, Miles is the ultimate combination of listener accessability and creative genius. A genius in his own right, Robet Irving III contributes some slick compositions, voicings, and programming on this CD also. A must have."
3,Not as awful as it has been painted...,"Like You're Under Arrest and Tutu, Decoy flirts heavily with synthesizers. Another thing it has in common with those two releases? None of 'em are all that good. I mean, this isn't a dog's dinner like it's made out to be, but it's not first-class Miles. ""Robot 409"" sounds like a bad cartoon theme, for god's sake, while both the title track and ""Code M.D."" are beefed up electronically, seemingly to cover up their lack of any strong melody or instrumental solos. Now, I do think that ""Freaky Deaky"" makes good use of the electronic stuff - appropriately enough, it sounds freaky. And hey, ""What It Is"" is about the funkiest thing on this album, plus the squealing, Wayne Shorter-like soprano sax solo sounds nice. Meanwhile, ""That's It"" does have an amusingly unpredictable groove, making it worth hearing as well. And ""What It Is"" is stirring, that's what it is. So that makes it the best post-retirement Miles album I've ever heard, not like that's saying much."
2,An improvisational jam album?,"I don't even know where to begin. This album seriously lacked musical direction. The only thing I enjoyed on it was Darryl Jones's bass playing. I apologize to anyone who enjoyed it but I just couldn't. I'd get ""Tutu"" or ""Aura"" before this one."
5,Me Gusta Mucho La Ministrasion.,"Estos Cantos Por Juan Carlos, Me Ha Ayudado A Seguir Adelante En La Musica, Soy Musico Toco El Piano Y Canto, y Algunos De Estos Canto Me Ha Ayudado A Seguir Adelante, Como El Canto, Jehova Es Mi Guerero, Glorificate, Mi Mejor Adoracion, No Basta, Y Le Doy Gracias Al Senor Jesus Por Aberle Dado Eso Don Tan Especial, Que Dios Le Bendiga De Una MAnera Especial,"
3,REPLACEMENT BATTERIES A FORTUNE!!,"My daughter got this for her 6th birthday. It was purchased in a store where the packaging allows people to try the toy's recording device before buying. Let's just say, that this toy must have been on the front of the shelf where EVERYONE was testing it out because the batteries on one of the recording devices was dead already. It requires 3 ""button cell"" watch batteries, which after trying 2 stores, we were able to replace for $3 a battery (yes, $9 total not including gas for the car) and that is just for the one device, the toy comes with 2 such devices!! That's a total of $18 just for batteries. My two girls do love this toy, however, and the recording devices are fun and seem to work well. The purse it comes with is made of very thin, cheap material. The item comes with a paper that says ""We listen to you!"" with a website for an online survey of this product. Guess what? The website does not work!! Again, it's a fun toy, but quite an investment!"
2,Too small,"Too small. I was hoping for something I could keep my LifeStyle meter, Test strips, alcohol pads lancet device and my Pen needle in. It won't do it. Over all size it would appear to fit. But the wallet is about 1 inch thick. So, Unless everything is 1/2 thick, It won't close and zip up.2 inched think might have done. Basically, It will hold a pen needle, some alcohol pads. Not much more. It was well made."
1,What A Terrible Album!,"This album is horrendous! Why can't we get more music like Bill & Gloria Gaither! This whole album sounds like the Disneyland Light Parade -- YUCK! As a Reverend, I have to object to this kind of innane and empty-headed music. This is the kind of music that pagans probably listen to before commiting sins."
5,Beep.,"Wow - this is the best Joy E album ever. Ronnie, Jeff, and Caleb simply rock and I can't wait to hear what they're going to come up with next. The difference between CHRISTIANsongs and other albums is the high quality and maturity of this album. There isn't a weak song on here! Spread the JOY and buy this CD!"
5,That Caleb guy is a stud,I have only one thing to say: Caleb is the man. Caleb Caleb Caleb! Rock on Lab.
2,"Good, but a little disappointing","I like Joy Electric. They have so much potential. This CD captures their potential. The flutters and beeps are perfectly done (though a little more overproduced--which isn't such a bad thing--and predictable than their earlier work.)I have heard a lot of people saying that this is their best album but the songs don't go anywhere, as good as they are, and they sound a little too much like Erasure's ""I say I say I say."" Beyond this the lyrics are waaaay too right-wing.Pat Robertson would give this CD a better review but I think that this CD belongs in the 'Christian Rock' area of the CD store--which has little significance to the rest of the world of music.(I feel really bad writing this review, because I really want to like this album!...)"
2,A so-so sculpt and a really bad paint job,"I really wonder if the figure i got is the same others review, mine is quite amateurish comparing it to other Neca's releases. Be prepared for some painting of your own."
3,not very sturdy,"The 2 blades came broken off, they are not sturdy at all. I have super glued them together a couple of times and they stay on a while and just break off again. Other than that it's great but i just wish it was more sturdy."
4,The Better Biography,"Although the material covered is similar, this video biography of John Steinbeck is far better than the one produced by Kultur, which is sparse on visuals and narrated by a Brit with a weak ear for American idiom. Peter Jones's version, on the other hand, is visually vital, emotionally compelling, and convincingly narrated by the actor Liev Schreiber. I recommend it for any school class or age group reading Steinbeck, the most American of modern American authors, for the first time."
1,Anti-Israel Crap is still art.,"This film is anti-Israeli propaganda, plain and simple. But watching the film from a neutral perspective would not give you this thought. It is a beautifully produced piece of art (and other things) showing in almost British style comedy the ridiculous nature of some of the more prevalent parts of Israeli culture. A highly recommended watch, but if you are looking for something without political motivations, I suggest you find another film."
1,Just more right wing garbage,"OK - maybe it's not 'garbage' but it's just more corporate America propaganda, that's for sure.For right wing conservatives who think that public efforts in regard to health care, civil rights, day care, wages and the environment are all bad, this is a winner.Yet, for those enlightened among us who believe that government has a responsibility to aid the needy, educate the masses, give health care to all, grant equal opportunity and protect our natural resources, this is nothing more than further proof that conservatism is a failed ideology.For the record, yes, I am a proud New Deal/Labor Liberal Democrat. I believe that government must fight for the little guy. I believe that, if left unchecked, the wealthy interests in America will take all they can out of the working families of America. I believe that the wealthy have one thing in mind - their own dollar gain. Thus, government must have one thing in mind - the welfare of working people. It's that simple."
3,nice but too big,"The shape and the color are very beautiful. But as the other buyers complained, it's pretty big and heavy, not suitable for young people I think."
3,"Looks nice, but not sturdy","This watch looks great and is very stylish, but did not hold up. Within a few months, the dial fell off. I would recommend this watch if it is to wear once in a while, but for daily use, it does not hold up well."
2,Difficult to use!,Seems to be very sticky and maybe that's why I haven't been able to get the backing off of the second side. Once I figure that out I think it will work great!
2,Nice shoulder pad but cheap buckles,"I ordered the ""Ultimate Model 2001-STR Shoulder Strap Deluxe"" as a replacement shoulder strap for my briefcase, because the rubber shoulder pad on my current strap had cracked from years of use. As a replacement shoulder strap, this item was a no-go. The buckles are made of cheap plastic and they don't swivel, so it's not likely to stand up to daily use. However, the rubber shoulder pad itself was a good size (6 inches by 2 inches), with ribbing on the underside of the pad to keep the bag from slipping off the shoulder. I cut the new strap away from its shoulder pad and threaded the new shoulder pad onto my current strap."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I saw the store model and noticed that the desk was a little lopsided, the sales person told me the store clerks had put it together wrong. Well, I was snookered. The holes for all the screws were not lined up properly. the entire desk slants so badly that I couldn't install the bottom drawer or the door."
1,not worth the money,had a lot of trouble with assembly. directions were not clearholes were drilled wrong on two boardsand the drawers do not work well / holes are mismatchedi would not recommend this desk to anyone
4,Another Uneven Anthology,"This was a fun anthology with a rather high sensuality rating but like most anthologies the quality was uneven. But three out of the five stories were worth reading, which is a pretty high average compared to some of the other anthologies that I have read. Actually, even the `bad' stories were not stinkers. It's a definite buyer if not a keeper."
5,"Moving, Humorous and Real Life","This is a great read--Divided Roads is a personal, intimate, human, real life story with complex characters in colorful settings that reach out from the page right to the reader's heart. I don't get much time to read fiction and this is one book that a friend recommended that was well worth the time. It's even more amazing that proceeds are going to non-profits. Enjoy!"
5,A Touching Story of Awakening--Great First Novel!,"Ned Mansour has written a pure story about the intersection of two lives. The main characters, Pete and Rocky, develop beautifully in ways that are sweet, but still ring true. This tale of life change also inspires life change. Thank you Ned."
2,Not what I thought I was ordering,"Good thing this was free, I didn't read the synopsis first so I hadn't realized what I was ordering. I plan on deleting this from my kindle."
2,Not radio quality,"It's not radio quality, however, it does have a couple tracks worthy of play. There seems to be too much production on this country album and the artist would have faired better with a simple guitar and 3 peice band backup. The vocals are hard to understand in parts even for a southern boy like myself. This is a new album but some of the sounds figure to be 80s pop."
1,Sometime You Gotta RUN,"RUN from stuff like this. This is a bad-mixed album. The songs are ok, the lyrics fine, I dont understand the fella though and the mixing is bad. Typical low quality independent junk. RUN"
2,Dance Until Dawn Is Good,I've heard it live at The Little Big Horn and it was good. I received a free copy of the CD and listened to the rest of the songs. The songs are great but something is wrong with the voice tracks. Plus my cd skips on track 5. It could be it's just the promo copy but because of this I cannot give it any higher than 2 stars. I want to see more!!!!
2,Saw Him Live,"And thought he was ok, just ok. The band he was with was horrible and that could have been part of it. I recieved a copy of the album and a copy of his new single dance til dawn. The tune is catchy but lacks polish. It sounds dated, like a 1985 country song with a real bad beginning that is cheesy to say the least. I've never heard anything more on this guy besides the web page I was directed to. Other songs on the album are ok, but nothing that stands out. 2/5 stars is all I can give it. edwin"
4,pretty good,"this book was pretty good. it covers a lot of ground, and many of the finest philosophers of the past couple hundred years give some decent arguments contra the existence of God.but the price of the book may be a bit much. i say that because there has been such a great resurgence in theistic arguments within the philosophy of religion over the past few years; hence this book is almost outdated. but philosophers of religion, no matter how far they have brought the argument, always return to the classical arguments, and herein you will find those classics articulated with rational vigor. in sum, its a fine addition to the philosophy of religion library."
5,Alive in Christ: How to Find Renewed Spiritual Power,"Charles Price is a master at explaining, through Scripture, how we are renewed and how Christ comes to live within us. His writing style is unique and down to earth making the words of God come alive and easily understandable. The book describes God's timeless purpose for us....in Christ. Really a must read along with his other work, ""Christ For Real."""
2,Self Induldgent Drizzle,"This is probably the most boring voyeristic window into some freak's life that I have ever encountered. First he's forcing me into watching some chick masturbate(on the phone no less!),and then lamenting that another lover treats him as less than a friend.This is ridiculous.Get a hotel room!Nice drumming though,subtle if nothing else is..."
3,Not really a biography,"There were definitely some insightful pages inside the book, but I would say that this book could barely be called a biography of the men. It's more like a detailed description of the plot of all their movies. There is, some biographical information in it, along with a couple interviews that were fantastic. But biography? No."
3,Not Lenovo,"The one I received was a Dell card. Also had ""NGD"" stamped on the back for what it's worth."
5,wish it came with a bulb,"i just wish i didnt have to buy the bulb seperate, but thats just me. otherwise the lamp is really good, keeps my scorpion warm."
1,Do not buy this camera,"I bought this camera from the nearby pharmacy. First off, there is no ""view finder."" There's only an LCD display for settings. You can't preview images and the moment your battery wears out, your images are gone. Well, that's what I learned from handling and reading the directions, anyway. My reason for returning it was that I couldn't take even one photo with it. I'm a very tech savvy person. Read the instructions front and back. All the little piece of junk did was make beeping noises and the numbers never changed. Images never showed up in the software either. The ""webcam"" part seemed to work but even with my well lit room, it barely showed anything.Avoid. It's not worth even $20."
1,Hell yeah this is trash!,This is the cheapest trash of the cameras that I've ever got as a gift. This can't even afford to be a video camera or take pictures easily. This trash shouln't be at a store at all. Period.
5,hmm,"interesting video...well i was expecting more ""flexibility"".. but it seems that this yoga maybe is for beginners?.. not sure.. but the woman is pretty. :)"
4,A True Art,"I viewed this title wondering how it would be done. The subject was done in a very tasteful art form, the woman performed perfectly balanced and very attractive. Well done"
2,Yogaporn,"Let's face it, this video is basically soft core porn. No discussion of yoga postures or anything else yoga. Lots of close-ups as the camera slowly glides over the ""yogini's"" body and quite fearlessly at that. Camera, have you know shame! Guess not. Isn't yoga all about the natural and connection with nature the spiritual. Ironic that the lady has fake fingernails and, shall we say surgically augmented...well you know...Great if you want to watch a hot chick twist and turn and expose everything, and I do mean everything! Not great for yoga instruction."
4,Hit and Miss,"I have an appreciation for the female body, and this emphasizes that pretty well. If anything it's relaxing, the model (to be honest) isn't as attractive as she seems on the cover. This also isn't very informative if you're actually trying to get into yoga and all that. Anyway I recommend this, and it was very much worth buying."
4,You want to see flexible?,"After a brief viewing of the video, I can appreciate the tone and style of the video. Just the same, I prefer Wenona's earlier work as an erotic wrestler on Ultimate Surrender or even in some of her bondage model performances for Kink.com. As one previous reviewer has stated, Wenona was possessed of a remarkably ripped physique, which was not evident in her role as Zen Goddess. Still, her flexibility demonstrating yoga was almost nothing compared to some of the situations she endured in Hogtied or Device Bondage. I respect that porn performers can have diverse interests and aspects of their personality, but it's tough to totally submerge myself into the Zen mindset with so many intense images of Wenona to recall."
3,Trust your intuition,"When you read reviews that go something like, ""I really wanted to watch a naked woman stretch..."" or ""the chick seemed hot"" then it's probably not really an exercise video. That being said, yes, it's a wonderful video of a beautiful, naked woman doing yoga. I vaguely remember some relaxing background sounds/music, but no instruction is given. Curiosity, got me on this purchase...."
1,Amazon is gross to sell pornb,Lowlives boycott amazon too cheap no values this is trash disgusting and shows how awful this co is. No class
3,Only held my interest for about 15 minutes,"I though it looked artful and gave it a shot (after the wife went to bed of course). At first I was somewhat interested, then I became more interested. After about 10 minutes, boy, I was really I interested.! Just when I thought my level of interest had peaked, I all of a sudden lost interest. Completely. Then I felt a little guilty, then hungry, then sleepy."
3,naked girl doing yoga,this girl isnt wearing any clothes in the whole video! if your into boobs and pussy you'll get what your looking for
2,Not too bad...just OK,"The video selected was the wrong one, but after watching a few minutes it wasn't too bad. Just kind of slow."
4,better then expected,"purchased to watch body in motion during yoga, got exactly that. pretty actor, nice music, and 2 dollars for rental. might buy dvd"
4,WINNER!,"Yes that's right. You can save money AND win money right at home. Well, for a ""piggy bank"" this is quite fun. I like to give it a pull every now and then to try my luck. This trying my luck has also caused me to forget the change I put in the ""bank"" section at the back thus saving me even more money! I recommend this as a fun way to store change and play a little game."
2,Bad subtitles ruin good movie!!!,"A visually impressive film that is faithful to Dostoevsky's novel. However, the bad black-and-white print of the movie is made even worse by the fact that the subtitles are in white -- in most scenes, they are completely unreadable!"
4,The Letter and the Spirit of Dostoevsky,"This film mesmerized me with its eerie sound effects and intense performances. A film Russian in its elemental humanity, German in its expressionist mis-en-scene. It's loud, even when it whispers. That the film itself haunts seems appropriate given that it is a ghost-story of sorts. If you're just looking for entertainment, look elsewhere. This is a film about ultimate questions.The transfer looks okay on analogue television, but on my laptop it lacks definition, as if it were transfered from a second-rate VHS tape. Wish the folks at Criterion would get their hands on this one. I would not hesitate to upgrade.If you like stately and intensely reflective films about the interior of the soul, by all means RENT this."
2,Poor Production Quality,"This poor quality black and white production with English subtitles makes viewing laborious for one not fluent in Russian. There's supposed to be a new English langauge production mini-series out this fall, so I'll wait for it."
5,learned a lot,"Since Ewing Young was my 3rd great grandfather, I was very interested in the book. My 2nd great grandfather Joaquin Jose Young was born in Taos, NM and was heir to Ewing's estate."
5,Claude Bolling is Great!,"We're fans of Claude Bolling. If your into a mix of classical music and jazz mix then this disc is for you! We've listened to it many times and have even had comments from guests who ask who was playing during a recent gathering or ours. Purchase this, it's great!!!!!"
4,BOLLING CELLO AND TRIO,"UNA NUEVA Y ADMIRABLE CREACION DE CLAUDE BOLLING, MAESTRO DEL GENERO. UNA DE SUS MEJORES PRODUCCIONES. EL VENDEDOR RESOLVIO TODO RAPIDAMENTE. GRACIAS."
5,Claude Bolling Jazz CDs,I was delighted to discover the Claude Bolling collection available on Amazon. I used to play the flute suite but didn't know he had written for other instruments. I purchased this CD for a cellist grandson.
4,Great band!,"I heard this band when I visited Florida. I purchased a CD & it was well worth it. This band isn't well-known but definitely a band on the rise. For all contemporary jazz lovers, you should support this band. Their web site is www.devinesoul.com."
3,PFM doesnt stand for Progressive Fantastic Music,"I got this album with the hope of an amazing italian prog experinence.This is not even close to ""prog"" in any way. It's alright music but itsounds like easy-listening 80's pop-rock.although they may be good musicians, its not very dynamicor interesting, in my opinion.It's super upbeat and pretty happy, which is cool if youwant to throw a birthday party for your grandma. however,all in all, not recomended for prog fans."
2,not what I wanted !,I wanted a documentary !! Something about the Japs rape of NANKING & SHANGHAI !!! Or the creation of a republic !
4,Great!,"Only wish it came with a case or ziplock bag to hold it all. Otherwise we love it, especially the magnetic part. Great for whiteboards."
4,review,a collection of mystery works by feminime writers... must read... interesting page turning cases... for all those mystery-lovers to read....
3,short mysteries,"A mixed group of mysteries. Some are very good and some are so, so. This is always a problem with short stories in groups like this. Overall I think it worth reading and purchasing."
1,Material recorded in 1928. Sound quality is poor.,"If I could have listened to this CD before I bought it, I would never have purchased it. The notes that came with the CD indicate the material it contains was recorded in 1928. The sound quality is very poor. I could listen to only three tracks before calling it quits. Avoid this CD unless you have to own everything Sophie Tucker recorded."
2,not enough velcro coverage for this average female arm,It turns out that I can not wear this Memorex Zune sport band unless I am wearing a very heavy/ bulky sweater or a coat. If I am wearing regular clothing the arm band falls down my arm. I can not get the velcro to make it any tighter. So I will only use this product when I am wearing heavy clothing (winter/outdoors). I am looking for another band for indoors.
3,"Good, but not great.","My armband arrived with a loose piece of velcro, which I had to crazy glue onto the strap. It fits fine, but my arm is 17"" at the bicep and it barely fits. I will use this band until it breaks again and have to fix it, or just replace it with something with a bigger fit. I has very little elastic give, but pretty much stays in place."
4,Memorex Zune Carrier,"I really like my Memorex armband holder. It allows me to work out with my music. There are a few drawbacks. If you sweat a lot, after a couple of weeks, the elastic part smells terrible. I'm not sure if I can wash it, but I have to try something, the elastic smells very sour from sweat.Also, the band does not aways stay up on my arms.Other than that, it secures my Zune very good and protects it."
5,Incredible,"This cd is proof that Propagandhi isn't just Chris. Todd's songs are incredible as always. This is some of the best (and unique) hardcore punk out their. There's some blast beats, good melodies, and incredible intelligent lyrics. If you like Todd's songs in Propagandhi you should DEFINITELY check out this album. If you like punk music at all you should really listen to them either way."
1,Poor customer service,"I ordered these bowling shoes and when I received them they were not what I expected, they were to small. I called the company got a return authorization, returned the shoes over a month ago and still have not received my refund."
5,a great piece of investigation,"Lindley has provided a major service to those interested in the Alamo and its principal characters. Thoughtful, imaginative, and incisively reasoned, this book offers new insight into a timeless episode of American history and heroism. KN"
1,T R Lindley seemed to have an ax to grind with Sam Houston,"Most of his sources seem to be from people who hated/disliked Sam Houston and instead of clearly stating his sources motives...he only spread their slander farther. It is one thing to have an opinion, but it is quite another to have a bias and let the beam in your eye obscure the mote in your neighbor's eye to paraphrase the allegory. If Sam Houston hasd created worlkd in 4 days T R Lindley would have asked why he was in such a hurry, he claims Houston was drunk during Runaway Scrape and only heroic Republic of Texas army strongarming him he would have run away. I do not know T R Lindley, but you can dman sure bet he NEVER would have uttered such ignorance to Sam Houston's face.Tainted like meat left in the sun this owrk is by author's prejudices"
2,Take it with a grain of salt.,"Much is made of the fact that Lindley was a military ""investigator"". This doesn't mean a thing. Fact is Lindley was ""searching"" for material for years to write a book that would make waves. Take much of this information with a grain of salt. It is much ado about nothing and none of the so-called revelations in this book can be proven. As a life long student of the Alamo I couldn't believe 1/10th of the claims in this book."
5,"""Alamo Traces"" is a must read book!","Tom does a fantastic piece of research in cutting through all the revisionist lies and laying the plain honest truth on the table.More than enough proof that the de la Pena writings are a complete forgery.If you love Alamo, you'll love this book!A must for all Alamo libraries!Too bad the movie folks didn't consult with Tom before they made this new Alamo movie complete with revisionist lies!!!!"
2,Little too do over nothing,"The problem with Lindley's book is that he automatically dismisses one statement with another. Based on what? Modern historians aren't trained in investigation and this method of digging up a so-called ""fact"" to discount another is hocus pocus. Bill Groneman is trained as a investigator and his books are more thoroughly thought out. Lindley needs to stick to cook books."
2,Cheap!,"I got this pair home and immediately thought it looked ""cheap."" Tried it on and it also felt ""cheap"" -- too light weight like the heel would break (and I'm not a heavy-set person - about 5'6"" and 130 lbs.) Great price, but I've seen shoes at Charlotte Russe that are just as cute and for about the same price!"
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a durable and gooooood quality product.Much better than the pictures show.Soft leather.The fit is perfect( Cobb size),I had to cut the overhang a bit.My Appi/TB loves it!Great pice,I will buy it again."
3,"3* for not SHIFT KNOB, but other than that SATISFIED","My Quick shift kit didn't come with a shift knob. But I already had the Retro Gray Ball, it's way better than the leather knobs. My shifting is a lot quick, I love it, and it's fun. Thanks for reading."
4,Good Read,"Again, another good read from Ms. Wesley. A great mystery story with chilling chapters. Ms. Tamara Hayle is back on track with attempting to solve the murder of an old friend. This old friend and Tamara grew up together and remained friends until something very immature broke up their friendship. Great story telling, I only wish that Tamara could find someone in her life to love, I was expecting ""Basil"" to return in this book, but to my surprise he didn't. Jake, Tamara old friend, is still dropping by Tamara house to visit with her and her son, but it appears perhaps Jake may have found someone special. In spite of Tamara love life, this is a good mystery story that all mystery lovers should enjoy."
3,Just OK!,"I don't regret reading it, because in general I enjoy the Hayle series, but this one left me feeling OK, not great I am ready to read it again...or I wonder what book will be next. For those who love Wesley, you will feel comfortable with Tamara's continued struggle to find love, keep her son happy and deal with the perils of living in an urban area plagued by crime and mystery. I think the familiar is what I did enjoy, although it amazes me how much she comes into contact with mayhem."
3,PJ,"This was almost too easy to solve. I would have liked to have been introduced to less characters, and the important ones to be fleshed out a little more."
1,this is a joke,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. ITS TO SMALL TO START WITH. CHANCES ARE THAT WHAT EVER YOU ARE GOING TO COOK WILL BURN ONE SIDE BEFORE THE REST IS COOKED. FLIP IT FORGET IT. WHEN YOU FLIP IT BATTER SPILLS OUT ALL OVER THE PLACE MAKING A BIG MESS. MY ADVICE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT ANY PRICE.
1,YOU DON'T GET WHAT YOU SEE,I got this item exspecting a pan with one flat side and one curved as said and a batter despenser and heart shape as said that i would recieve. well i got a pan with two side curved which i can't cook in and no dispencer or haert shaped cutter. i wouldnot recommend this product to any one. the only reason i bought it on line is because the store i bought my first one doesn't sel them any more.
3,Radio City Music Hall 9/21/2005,"Unbelievable show in a famous hall that was packed, while Elton John down the street at Madison Square Garden couldn't sell out.I took my daughter, a 21-year old student at NYU and she was wowed! It takes alot to impress her because she sees so many NYC shows.But, she was so happy, had her Mom listen to most of the concert via cell phone. And, my daughter knew all of the songs that she had not heard since she was a little baby. Needless to say, Sittin In Again is on her Ipod and also playing at Pasta Presto, a cute, Italian restaurant in NYC whenever she waitresses there. The regular customers love it so much, that my daughter has left her CD that we bought at the concert, so that the restaurant can use it. And, spread the good feelings!"
5,Superb,"This is really superb on all counts. The song selection, musicianship, enthusiasm, production - all top notch."
5,BEAUTIFUL!,"WHAT GREAT SHOW!, I'VE WAITING ALL MY LIFE TO SEE THEM PLAY, BE FREE IS AMAZINGLY PERFORMED, AND ALL OF THE SET LIST IS A REAL JOURNEY THROUGH THEIR MUSIC, THE BACKUP BAND EXCELLENT.BEAUTIFUL!!!!"
3,"Good music, bad production","I'm a big fan of the music. I first bought ""Mother Lode"" back in the 70's and it's still one of my favorite recordings. I missed this tour, but was happy to see it released on DVD. The concert itself was great. Band was good and Loggins & Messina were relaxed and playing comfortably. I was especially impressed that they didn't bring in a slew of extra musicians to sweeten their sound. Basically it's the same instrumentation that they toured with back in their hey-day. Great playing from all.However, I have a BIG complaint about video production. The constant camera switching made the video almost unwatchable. There seemed to be no shot that lasted for more than 2-3 seconds before it switched to another camera. (It was especially bad during the song ""Be Free"".)So, while the music was very good, the DVD suffered badly because of some overzealous producer who clearly didn't have an understanding of how to edit a concert video. I give it a three."
3,Good for kids,"Instruction is pretty clear, but the puppets make it clear, it is for kids. I think 30 min is too short for its price. There are only 6 tricks you can learn some of which you may have already known. So I would recommend this for a real beginner."
4,"CUTE, CUDDLY AND HELPFUL TIPS!","As a TV Producer/Photographer in Tulsa Oklahoma where this video originated (I did not produce this video), I can say the tips are very helpful for the average viewer with a dog. You can easily learn new ideas and the pets featured are very good. The video production is better than average and the narrator on camera is having fun with the tips. We featured this video on a local show and the response has been very good. I recommend this video for anyone ready to teach an old dog new tricks!"
5,excellent book - especially if you are raising boys.,I loved the simple story of this boy and his relationships with grownups. I saw pieces of my own young children in the main charactor and was engrossed from start to finish.
3,Not for Everyone,"Interesting to go back to a such a different time for much of the country. Not sure many of my book club members would actually enjoy - somewhat like revisiting the ""Wizard of Oz"" timeframe."
4,awesomness!,"I have a close friend that used to own Rolling Hills Asylum in Bethany new York. Its a huge building that's in severe disrepair. She used to run ghost hunts out of it. Ghost hunters, taps, and ghost the 'ghost adventure's guys on the travel channel have all been there. Its a severely active place. This book is about the people that lived there when it was a functioning facility. She has a record of every single person that lived and died there and alot of them are spoken of in this book. It is absolutely awesome to see how they lived before they passed and now supposedly haunt rolling hills. The elm tree they named the book after died in 2000. They've now planted an oak tree there instead."
5,A gently moving story,"I read this book for English. Instaed of dreary depressing story, it is a strangely uplifting as the story movingly follows a young boy on his journey to understanding. Living in a county home, part mental hospital, part home for the disabled, the boy encounters a strange vcast of characters from the woamn who killed her husband to the gentle giant, the boy is lovingly brought up by all those aroud him."
2,Reading and reading and never getting anywhere,"Upon a friend's rave review of this book, I immediately ordered it. What a dissapointment. This novel is nothing more than a minute by minute, day by day catalog of what a somewhat dimwitted little boy does at the ""County Home"" while his aunt and uncle attempt to watch over him. The setting is murkily conceived at best, and the characters are nothing more than opportunities for ""stories"" to happen. Is this ""Home"" a prison? Is it a half-way house? Is it a mental hospital? Is it a home for the maimed and deformed? I don't know...and I don't think the author does either. There is no plot; there is no direction, and after 200+ pages, I lost interest in even finishing."
5,A Heart Warming Tale,"Lynn Barry has crafted a sometimes warm, sometimes sad, sometimes happy, but always interesting tale in ""Puddles"".Before I was through, I felt like I was one of the family!It was that absorbing.A great job."
1,Avoid This One,"Simply put, I did not enjoy this book, and I do not believe that any level headed reader will enjoy it. The content is just plain silly, and the writing is very poor and dull. The story is childish in the worst way. Try something else. You'll be glad you did."
5,Heartwarming Faith,"I know that this is a book of fiction, but the reality of it made my mind take pause. Puddles is an extremely poignant view of one woman's struggle to keep herself as well as her home, family, and friends from falling apart. It is with the ""keeping the faith"" theme that Ms. Barry is able to weave together a tale of hope, despair, and timeless love.It made me believe in new beginnings and forgiveness not only for others, but also for myself. This is truly a remarkable book."
2,Disappointing!,This was a quick but disappointing read for me. I found it to be very predictable and shallow. I would not recommend this book.
1,Maybe Her Second Book....,"Troubling a sit is to review a book such as this, I feel that certain things must be said. The title portends one thing and the contents deliver quite another. That is not good news for the reader. But more of a problem is the premise this person has embraced. I found the plotting to be a bit dense and the characters as plastic as a 2-litre bottle of grocery store soda, not even Coca-Cola or Pepsi. The effort shows a desire and perhaps this writer will score a winner on her next go-round...."
2,Ink,While this may be a great product it did me no good.. I was not able to refill my ink cartridges ....too much trouble and mess!
3,great product for the money,although messy I did like the price and the amount of ink you received with this item. I still use this brand to this day.
2,Not so entertaining or informative.,"I was looking for a lot more information and beauty here. This seems like you something that might have been shown at elementary schools back in the 50's.Classic Appalachian Culture Films DVD: 1950s Appalachian Mountain Daily Life, Culture, Music, Food, People, & Schools History Pictures Films"
5,Excellent book for a great cause,"I have made a number of these recipes... all of them have been wonderful. When I celebrated Thanksgiving in my home in Switzerland this past year, Chelsea Clinton's Sweet Potato Casserole brought the house down. Its a great book for a great cause. Bravo."
5,Perfect Mother's Day Gift,Great recipes for a great cause...Great mix of award winning chefs and celebrity talent. I enjoyed mine so much I'm getting another for my Mother-in-Law for Mothers Day!Lori from NY
2,It's all buzz,"Who really cares what so-and-so can make? It's almost insulting to novice and inspiring chefs to think thier own creativity should be dictated by a famous face. There are no lessons or tips from the cooks. Many recipes seemed like copies from other cookbooks I've read just with a celebrity name attached. It would have been nice to have ordinary people with support of her ""cause"" to submit recipes instead. Thumbs down- it was a disappointing (...)."
2,"Good for the cause, not for the food!","I received this book from my father-in-law, an aspiring chef and husband of a survivor. While we think many of the recipes are not that original, we value the authors use of time to help the cause. A little disappointed in the ""celebrities"" chosen, my wife and I would have preferred those who really know how to cook. For example: Britney Spears is not really known for her cooking (ie: her now defunct restaurant) though Emeril was a good choice. Katie Couric was a cute choice but does she really cook? I can honestly say that some of the recipes did look like renditions of many others I have seen in other cookbooks. However, the reason for the book is the reason to buy it."
5,Great Book for a Great Cause,"I bought this book in order to support the cause, and I just wanted to let people know that they will get their money's worth! Plenty of great recipes for all tastes. Thanks to Tami and her crew for all of their efforts! Job well done!"
4,I didn't want the book to end!,I am an avid reader of all types of literature and occasionally I come across a book I truly do not want to end and this is one of those stories. I found it a little hard to get into but once I started I too fell in love with the characters and the story line. Thank you Laura and I am looking forward to your next release.
1,Junk,"Total junk. Installer shut down, forcing a manual installation. Image is grainy, regardless of settings, colors aren't right. Horrible, avoid."
1,I'm returning this camera today,All I got on this cam is Yellow Orange Images. It is so grainy that it is hard to distinguish what is being shown. I am very unhappy with this cam and I am returning it today.
2,Absolute Junk,"This camera is easy to install, but its not that hard to set a piece of manure on your monitor in the first place. The picture is absolute garbage. get a good one.. leave this one alone.."
1,Have not got it yet,If shipping in 1 to 2 buss days I ordered it on the 9th whare is it? It is now the 15th.
4,Great Value,"This is easy to install, easy to update (online), and very very easy to use. Don't expect super high resolution photographic excellence, but if you want to talk via video chat online, take snap shots, or send recorded messages this is the business.More than enough for the avergae computer user, highly recommended."
1,Not worth it.........,"...This camera isn't worth it. Fuzzy images (even when focussed) and yellow pictures (no matter how you try to adjust the settings) make this camera a total zero. I just bought it tonight and will be returning it first thing tomorrow. Bottom line...If you're thinking about buying it, don't. And if you already bought it, I hope you kept your reciept........... :)"
3,think your getting a good camera-guess again!!!!!!!!,"This camera is easy to set up(only if you have usb port). The quality is bad you will see yourself but there will be streaks. And i would consider getting a light because without one near the camera you cant see yourself. The software is great and easy to use. Here are the pros and cons:Pros: Easy to set up Great software Cheap priceCons: Poor picture quality Focus is hard to use Need alot of lighting for good visiblityMY MESSAGE TO YOU:If your considering on buying this camera for fun i would get it if you are using it for school,work and relying upon the camera get a better one."
1,Not worth it.........,"Even at about $40, this camera isn't worth it. Fuzzy images (even when focussed) and yellow pictures (no matter how you try to adjust the settings) make this camera a total zero. I just bought it tonight and will be returning it first thing tomorrow. Bottom line...If you're thinking about buying it, don't. And if you already bought it, I hope you kept your reciept........... :)"
2,Picture sucks......severe quality drop from older model,"I bought this camera to replace an older model of quickcam which looks the same and is also USB. I replaced it because for some reason Windows XP doesn't like it and it can't be used with XP since the OS upgrade. This camera installed easy but I had to D/L the XP software off the web as the software it came with is old. I expected at least the same quality as the other since it's been years and I now have the best OS available. NO!!! The picture quality is crap and can't be tweaked. There is this total grainy appearance to the images and the DPI seems much less even though its still 150DPI. Don't waste your money.....I don't see any resolution/quality differences with the more expensive models either....good luck,Mike"
1,Forget this!,"Even if you just want this camera for casual use with your computer and are flexible about picture quality, you will probably have headaches installing the drivers. I gave up on their mouse years ago, and I suggest avoiding this product as well. I got it as a gift, and I found that with respect to camera, software, and overall quality this product is a loser."
2,Does Quality Matters To You?,"When I bought this webcam, I first thought that it can act just like a digital camera, but right now I know that I was mistaken. If you're just looking for a way to share your pictures and videos with friends and family this is a good choice, because its very cheap, easy to use and has good Internet capabilities. But if the quality of pix and videos and size of them matters to you I really don't recommend it to you. The biggest picture that you can take by it is 320x240."
2,So so... not the best,"I bought this camera about 3 days ago.The picture quality during day time is quite good and clear.But during lighted conditions (night time) its not that good.And I'm a little disappointed since I mostly video chat at nights.:(Another drawback is that the stand is not the user friendly... in terms of that U need to keep it at higher level so as to show the picture correctly..All in all, a good product for the price.A budget buy."
4,I love the quickcam!,I am new at the computer game but found this quickcam and mike very user friendly. It is clear enough of a picture to see my grandchildren in California while chatting with them. No problem focusing the camera or using the software.
4,Plenty of fun,"*Very* nice quality for the price, especially being a color camera. I was amazed at all the options the software offers, including a few Pong-like games! It's also lightweight and easy to install. Very comprehensible instructions and a lot of fun to use. :) It's a great little camera!"
2,image is poor. really difficult to mount.,"it came with dsl service for free. it was laying around floor for 1 year and I decided to plug in my XP laptop to use it with yahoo messenger service.pro:installed without CD or driver disk on XP. just plug in and it was ready.con:image is poor. (you can improve picture quality by manualy adjust settings. increase contrast and hue. lowering gamma and color level, and etc...) it [is] still [poor] compared to just about any other video source I've seen.my biggest complaint:thick heavy cable causes camera to rotate and it's really difficult to set it at the direction it should be facing. why quickcam has been insisting on this unfunctional rubber base design for years, I have no idea. 'eye ball on top of pyramid' design looks cool. but it's stubborn one that looks away on it's own will."
2,For beginners only.,Logitech QuickCam Express offers only the very basics and the image quality let much to be desired. If you think of using it occasionally then this camera may be for you but if you are interested by the fascinating world of cam communities then I would suggest you invest in something better. But hey what can you ask for 40$!
2,Couldn't get it to work,"I spend about 6 hours with online tech support tools, phone tech support (tool call) with Logitech, and support through my computer manuafacturer...all to no avail. I could not get a picture with the camera on my HP Pavillion 8360 system. I returned it."
3,Not as good as I though it would be,This is my first webcam and I was kinda let down after I loaded in the software and got started. First off the cam makes everything very dark. You have to have direct light shining at you to be able to see your self on the screen. The cam also causes a orangish hue to everything. And still no matter how much you try you can't really fix these problems. The cam itself fits pretty well in most surfaces. Clarity is also sometimes a problem. Not quite worth the close-to 50$ but still ok.
2,"eh, not so great","I bought this quickcam about a year ago when the price was [less](eek!). Easy to use, but the picture quality was just horrible. Very grainy."
2,Got Light? - Fix for Base,"I agree with most.. this camera [stinks]. Do not buy if you want high qaulity video. Do not buy unless the subject will be well lit and very close to the camera. The camera installs easily and is easy to use.You can make the base work a little better by wraping some tape around the metal peg. This will increase the friction between the cam and the base, making it more stable. The metal peg can also be unscrewed from the camera allowing tripod attachment or a custom made base.The best usb webcam I've seen is the 3com homeconnect. Although quite pricy, it delivers a clear, detailed, colorful image even in low light.Consider using a video capture card. With a video capture card you can plug in any video source... camcorder, dvd, digital camera, miniature spycam etc..."
2,You can find better,"The quality of the video on this camera is very poor. In addition to being ""pixelated"" there is a yellow hue to it no matter what I tried. I got two of them...and tried them on two different computers with poor results on both. Might be OK for someone who has never used a webcam before, but if you are used to decent video you will be disappointed in this camera. Also, the ""stand"" makes positioning very difficult."
4,For the money...,"I just recently purchased a Logitech QuickCam Express. I've had experience around computers, but the webcam was simple to install. I just plugged it in and the software took care of the rest. Within minutes I could broadcast over the internet. The camera is easy to use, but on the other hand it is quite fuzzy, even when it's been focused. It's a great camera for the money and I highly recommend it. But if you would like perfectly clear pictures you might want to go with a little higher model, such as the Quick Cam Web."
4,Decent,"I bought this because it was in my price range. The quality isn't great, but it does what I need it to do.If you need a still or video PC camera for school, don't get this one. Spend the extra money and get a really nice one. If you just need a PC camera for instant messageing and sharing photos, this is a good camera."
4,Exquisite,"Flawed sound engineering (you can often hear the breathing of the closely miked performers) barely detracts from the luminous, unearthly beauty that sings from every phrase and syllable of this incredible performance. I have heard many recordings of this music, and I would not choose another."
3,Are we talking about the same recording?,"After reading the first two reviews, I wonder if the group recorded the piece again differently. On my recording, the second cello is constantly rushing the pizzicato in the second movement. My internal metronome rebels against this to the point that I can't stand listening to it. I'm buying a recording with a different group of performers in hopes of finally getting a CD that has the strict rhythm that the Budapest Quartet with Benar Heifetz perform on my old LP. Maybe there's a CD of that very recording. It'll be a relief."
3,Does Not come with bindings,"The bars were good, felt very solid. I made the mistake of thinking the bindings were included to attach the bars to my SUV. They're not included so had to return the bars and buy a full rack system. So would recommend the bars if you need only the bars (and would give them 5 stars)."
3,Misleading but...,"You only get the crossbars not the attachments, However if you look at the picture they faded out everything else so it kind of makes sense."
1,these are only the bars not the whole kit,i thought this was the whole kit and it was not double check and make sure you get the whole package
1,Thule is over priced junk,I bought the whole Thule kit. The load bars are not that strong and the kit itself is very poorly designed and way over priced. Cheap flat hooks and a cheap carrier will work just as well.
5,road to recovery,"I am a huge fan of this stuff. My lab had one knee surgery and was borderline on having to have the other one done. i started giving her Nupro and feeding her a high nutrient diet, and she is really getting better. Who knows if it was really the nupro, the diet, or just plain rest, but we had tried just about everything for several months and her condition only seemed to get worse with time until we made this change. Definitely at least worth a try. AND dogs LOVE the taste."
3,Review,Under review- book looks interesting and am looking forward to finding time to spend with the book. Looks informative. Goodf
5,Buy this CD,"Sokolov gets inside the music as few others ever have. I know of no more satisfying recording of the Chopin Preludes. Masterful array of keyboard colors and sonorities, beautifully recorded. The performances are lyrical, passionnate, spontaneous, and full of integrity. Buy this one today."
5,Just superb,"This is the finest collections of the Chopin preludes that I have ever heard and I have heard them played by the masters - Gieseking, etc."
4,Cyberdélinquance et cybercrime,"N'importe quel utilisateur de PC peut aujourd'hui se transformer en redoutable pirate. Qu'il sagisse d'installer un programme espion, fabriquer un virus, faire circuler une fausse information, toutes les recettes se trouvent en libre accès sur Internet.

1,"Don't waste your money, a piece of junk","I have had this shredder about 2 years. It's just sitting in my basement. I was only able to use it for about 3 months before a piece from the motor broke off in the wastebasket and before that it kept getting jammed. In those three months large pieces of paper would drop in the basket underneath that hadn't been shredded, but pass through the shredder.I had no one to complain to to get a refund (which I would have done if I had purchased it at a retail store). This exprience has turned me off regarding purchasing electronics online. Yesterday, I went to my local Walmart store and purchased another shredder(different brand). This shredder cost me a little under $50 and works perfectly so far. The Royal 10x needs to be taken off the market. Under question number one (how do I rate item, I would have not picked a single star if that was one of the chooses. Buyer beware."
5,Love these shoes,"I have had problems with my feet for some time and decided to give these a try after listening to friends rave about them. When I wear these I have zero pain in my feet, but an added bonus is that my knee and hip don't hurt, either. YAY for shoes that work!"
4,Change?,"Love birkenstocks and this is my husband's third pair of milanos. Has the sizing changed though? We got the same size as all his other pairs and these fit smaller. Otherwise, the order came quickly and as described."
1,ouch,ouch ouch ouch ouch ouchThey're stiff. They rub in wrong places.I've had to invest in a few boxes of callous remover.
3,Smaller than it looks in the picture,"I ordered this bag for someone at his request. It looks quite big in the picture but in fact its actually a small bag for garnishing tools eg... small knives etc. Although it does say so in the title, beware... it cannot be adapted to fit regular size kitchen knives. It is what it says.. for garnishing tools, so check the dimensions before ordering to be sure."
3,"great, as long as they stay together",these glasses look cool and are comfortable... but I have broken about 7 pair so far... though I still want another pair.
3,Willy Wonka Glasses,For being a cheap dress up toy these glasses haven't been too bad and they haven't been broken yet. However they do have a hard time staying on your face.
1,Not Johnny Depp Glasses,"When did Johnny Depp wear soemthing like this i never seen it.(Product Description: Even Willy Wonka needs sunglasses. Look like the great candyman in these dark shades. These glasses were created after those worn by Johnny Depp in the 2005 movie, and have the Wonka ""W"" on the sides.)The ones he wore was a goggle type sunglasses shown here: [...] the ONLY thing that even these glasses have to do with the Willy Wonka movie is the ""W"" on the sides thats it."
3,AutoCAD LT 2002,"AutoCAD LT 2002 is an excellent product. It does everything I had expected it to do but the licensing policy is unfairly restrictive. I was required to purchase a new license because no upgrade path exists for the AutoCAD LT 95 product that I owned previously. Prospective customers should also be aware that, unlike software licenses purchased from many other vendors, AutoDesk does not allow the license to be resold to another user."
1,I use it every day,"After using a product on a daily basis I can say this program is definitely not worth it, I have started with R12, then R14, ADT 2000 and now 2002 and still the program crashes on all of our computers at least twice daily, many times without even saving ANYTHING to the recover file. The program makes a user want to pick up a pencil and start drawing by hand again!"
4,Best self study English method - Comunicative aproach,"This is the 3rd book out of 4 from this collection.It's based on Comunicative Approach, which means you will learn the four habilities: speaking, listening, writing, and reading at the same time on each of the lessons.It's a very good material with clear examples as well. The CD will help you a lot to understand about the rithm of the spoken English.I recomend the DVD set and the Teacher's Guide if you intent to teach English as a second language or if you want to clarify even more your way of learning."
1,Not a Boy,"I bought two pairs of these for my daughter...both made her look as if she had ""man parts""! She returned them."
2,Poor Fabric,"The style and fit are fine, but the fabric is very unpleasant. It feels like you are wearing a wetsuit. I would not buy these again."
4,Good Value!,"Great pants for exercise or lounging around the house. The fabric has a bit of a rubbery feel to it and it's thinner than my Nikes and Adidas, but they are about half the price. I also like the fit--not too baggy, not too tight."
4,Code Unknown: Reality Unknown,"This is a masterpiece of collage. The non-linear sequence of the story can make it hard to watch, but very intreging. It blows open the thoughts that we have in everyday life. That we are the most important, it shows that every life is insignificant to other people. The story deals with racism and mature themes, underlying troubles. It gives us glimpes into the fact that at times we can reach out and change other peoples' lives but in fact we choose to change only our own, as you see in the very end of code unknown. The interweaving of the storyline makes it a wonderful way to see the daily interaction between people that don't know eachother, and choose not to know eachother. There is only one linear scene in the entire movie and that would be the drum scene, but everything is brought together in the end. I would highly recommend this story to anyone that has the time and patience to sit down and watch a good/uncoventional movie."
3,Rare Cinema Verite...,"A film by Michael Haneke (The Piano Teacher, Funny Games), it stars Juliette Binoche as a an actress with a troubled brother in law and other characters who piece together this 'puzzle' of sorts in a study of the human condition. The use of very long shots and detailed sound bring an ethereal feel to the film, very human and organic. Fun to watch, but at times it was confusing trying to keep up with the fragmented narrative structure and the French language track. *** 1/2 stars."
1,Point Unknown,"I'll keep this brief, as I feel like I've already wasted too much time on this movie as is. Turgid, pretentious, and relentlessly grim. At least that was my opinion of the first 100 minutes -- I turned it off after that. Maybe it got better in the last 15 minutes. Don't bet on it though."
2,Nothing to say...,"Ha, Ha and Ha!What does the director want to tell us?Probably the answer is ""Code Unknown"".The title is perfect and represented everything about the movie and director."
4,Full maple bridge,The bridge that I ordered from amazon was all that the said it was. At first I was worred about ordering off line I thought that I was going to get a piec of scrap wood but the bridge they sent me was verry nice and it looks great on my viola.Thanks amazon
4,Solid Mix of Gould,"This 3 Cd Set contains works by the composers, Beethoven, Haydn, and Mozart.The Beethoven Works include :Piano Concerto No. 1 in C, Op. 15Piano Concerto No. 2 in B Flat, Op. 19Piano Sonata No. 30 in E, Op. 109Piano Sonata No. 31 in A Flat, Op. 110Piano Sonata No. 32 in C Minor, Op. 111The Mozart Works include :Piano Sonata No. 10 in C, K. 330Fantasia & Fugue in C, K. 394The Haydn Works include :Piano Sonata No. 49 in E Flat, Hob. XVIAll of the works on this set can be found on other albums. The Fantasia and Fugue, and the Haydn Sonata can be found Glenn Gould's volume dedicated to him on the Great Pianists of the 20th Century. If you are huge fan of Glenn Gould, this is an album to pick up for sure, or if you are missing any of this music by him. The Haydn Sonata, and last Beethoven Sonata for me are the highlights of the album. I personally recommend and enjoy The Glenn Gould Legacy Volume 4 album more which contains works from Krenek, Schonenberg, Berg, Scriabin and Prokofiev."
5,This book started it all for me!,I love this book!!The minute I began reading I knew I found what I'd been searching for...why bad things happen to good people and WHY I AM HERE!! Robert Russell put everything into perspective for me and my experiences started to make sense. There is a cause and effect for everything I do and now I can understand it!
1,The Last Of The Mohicans: Original Motion Picture Soundtra,I was looking for more of the Celtic/Colonial themes. Most of this soundtrack is orchestral noise.
5,Worth it,"I think most of the people here will agree that this is a great soundtrack. The fact that that it features two composers (Randy Edelman & Trevor Jones) is not as much of an issue for me as it has been for some. In fact, I like the fact that I get a contrast in musical styles on the CD. The only drawback, which I don't fault this CD much for, is the Clannad song. While many here like it, I feel that it is very much out of place on this CD with the instrumental works of Edelman and Jones.This was one of the first soundtracks I ever bought and I don't regret it for a second."
4,Haunting and lovely,"This is one of my favorite movies, and I really hoped the soundtrack would stand alone. It does, but seems as though they left a lot out to fit on the CD. What's here is lovely, giving both a Celtic feel and drawing you into a sense of how colonial New York was during the French and Indian War. But I can only give it 4 stars, instead of 5, because some really great music in the movie is missing here.Clannad's ""I Will Find You"" is one of the highlights, and worth the cost of the CD just to have it. This is excellent music, well worth having in your soundtrack collection."
4,This is good...,"This is a good soundtrack that complemented the film. However, one reviewer said ""It's the best music ever written"" which I say, ""No way!""The variation of the theme, in my opinion, does get a bit monotonous, but the theme is beautiful and I enjoy listening to the CD."
5,The Last of the Mohicans Soundtrack,"A magnificent score by Trevor Jones. It is the greatest soundtrack I own and is better than The Mission's soundtrack by Morricone imho. Not one track disappoints. Hell, it might be the best cd I own as well. Grab this one and see the movie as well! WOOPEE!"
5,AN ACHINGLY BEAUTIFUL MOVIE SOUNDTRACK...,"I had never before bought a soundtrack for a movie that wasn't a musical. This was an exception. Who couldn't help but buy this CD? It is simply one of the most beautiful movie soundtracks of all time, as it perfectly conveys the romance, urgency, and adventure of the movie. It resonates and soars, capturing the essence of the film.Beautifully orchestrated, tracks one through nine were composed by Trevor Jones, and his use of drums, brass, and strings to convey the sweeping saga of the movie is masterful and full of powerful, pulse pounding emotion. Yet, at the same time the music is often poignant.There is a seamless transition to tracks ten through fifteen which were composed by Randy Edelman and are likewise beautiful, but lighter and more ephemeral in tone. The music is more hopeful and mellow, yet at the same time wondrously melodic.The collaborative efforts of the two composers have produced a timeless masterpiece. This is a CD to treasure."
3,Good BUT.....,"This Cd was much of what I expected. However I was severely disappointed when It came to I will find you- Clannad, which was one of the major factors in me getting this rather than just picking up the score at my local department store. In the movie this particular song is several minutes long with a number of verses, but on the cd they give you 1:42 which is just the first verse, you don't even get the verse for which the song was named."
4,Agreed With Others,"Music creates the mood of life. I agree that the entire score of ""Promentory"" should have been included on this CD. What a very moving piece of music. I missed hearing music from the end credits. I don't understand why these entire scores were omitted. That would have made it complete. I loved this movie. It is powerful and deep and the music is so perfect as to create a picture in my mind each time I hear it. It makes me sad for the loss of the American Indians and the wolves and their world that was lost forever."
4,"Soundtrack is good, but a little bit disappointing","I thought the soundtrack was awesome, but the things that I hate about some of it was the fact that they cut most of the Promentory out. The part when Alice and Uncas died in the movie is my favorite part of the piece. Also, the ending to Top of the World really should include the end credits in the movie. It would of made it more complete. Other than those, I thought the soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks of all time, not to mention the movie as also a very awesome movie."
5,Last of the Mohicans,"This has to be one of the best soundtracks i have ever heard, every song is beautifully composed and performed. This movie has to be one of my all time favorites,I cant count how many times i have watched the movie and listened to the soundtrack. on a professional level being a musician, i say This soundtrack is 5 stars..."
5,It's the best soundtrack of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,well.....I love it! It's the best soundtrack I've ever heard. If you ever take it off the market there will be riots in the streets!!
1,Promontory - disappointing,"""Promontory"" was cut short and is not as it was in the film. It was the climax of the entire film, and this tune made it a complete package. Very disappointing. This is the 3rd soundtrack/score that I've purchased in the hopes of having this tune as it was in the movie. It looks like my only option is to somehow have the music ripped from the DVD itself."
2,A disappointment,"I was going by memory of faint music I had heard in a museum when I ordered the sound track of The Last of the Mohicans. It turned out to be a disappointment. The sound track uses electronic music instead of an orchestra, and so the music sounds artificial to me. I am a big fan of original score sound tracks, but they usually use orchestral instruments, which sound much better."
3,Three tracks do not a soundtrack make.,"I gave this piece an average rating because that's what it ended up at--average. That is, when one considers the two or three tracks that are very nice (if a bit...repetitive) (Tracks 1, 3, and 6), and then places them next to the *rest* of the soundtrack, which is really quite bad...you end up with something that's average. Or, to put it more to the point: Be glad it's on CD, so you can skip the crap."
4,omitted song,"I love this soundtrack, but was very disappointed that the movie version of Promentory was not on the cd. Does anyone know of a cd with the movie version on it?"
4,A very powerful soundtrack!!,"I'm a bit of a soundtrack junky - if I find one I like, I buy it, & usually play it to death.This is a favorite of mine - liked it ever since the movie came out (not a bad movie, either, by the way!) I don't normally add reviews, but Jerry McCulley's comments didn't ring true to me. This is a very beautiful soundtrack which I can highly recommend.Since everybody else is doing it, favorite tracks are: 1,3,4,6,11Bottom line: I'm listening to it now, as I write this! That should say something! Enjoy!"
5,The Best Music! The best Movie of the planet!!!,"This is absolutely the most astounding soundtrack of the century! The movie gets even better! It certainly is the most powerful and dramatic movie of the year and hopefully, more movies like LOTM can come out of hollywood!!"
5,Two thumbs up!,"This music is one of the best soundtrack pieces I have heard. I would recommend it to anyone who has seen the movie and loves it; or someone who enjoys instrumental music. My only negative thought about this CD is that ""Promentory"" was cut in half from the version in the movie, but this can be overlooked considering that the other pieces make up for it. Happy listening!"
5,Love this soundtrack!!!,"The Last Of The Mohicans has been one of my most favorite soundtracks of all time! I have the movie too and it never gets old. I actually broke my original soundtrack that i had for nearly 10 years and was upset, i looked it up on amazon and found it for a better price than what i originally purchaced it! Very relaxing and mind clearing. Great product!"
3,Sound track is great...Amazon download is a cluster-F,"Amazon continues to make buying music a nightmare. All this is is a folder with MP3 files. Yet Amazon continues to throw monkey wrenches into their system as often as they can. This purchase was slightly better in that all I had to do was download, yet again, their downloader. The last purchase was sent to the cloud player, and I guess it was pretty cloudy since the purchase never showed up. I had to actually call them and have them get it fixed. I informed them that I do not spend money so that somebody else can have the files. Anyway the download is down. however it took two attempts after the downloader was downloaded again. I am tired of typing the word download."
5,Outdated BUT still USEFUL,"This book is outdated (1998) but I think it's an excellent book for general personal finance because it explains in layman's terms several financial concepts.I even like the author's boldness throughout the book, it keeps it interesting for me to read.This book does not have any complicated financial concepts only the basics that I can very well go over again.The books includes information not only what investing is but also:1. The different institutions where you can invest2. Mutual funds vs stocks3. How a stock is born (very interesting for people who are just learning stocks)4. The fees mutual funds charge investors5. Index funds6. Debt & claiming bankruptcy7. Taxes (oddly interesting)8. Different kind of insurances you should carry9. What a house really costsand etc."
2,Rule #1: Use cheap glue to publish your book...,"(I wasn't even halfway finished with the first chapter when the book began to fall apart!)This book, like so many others, has the elitist belief that the reader already has money and simply does not know how to handle it.Here's MY situation: I'm a part-time student/full-time employee in a dead-end job, barely making ends meet. I would like a personal finance book that shows me how to survive in my current situation and save money to put myself into a better situation.Does anyone out there have any ideas?"
2,Prepair yourself,"This is quite possibly the hardest comedy I have ever had to sit through. The story is very hard to follow (if you can follow it at all), and the humor is hard to grasp (I don't know if you have to be Australian to get the jokes or what). If your in the mood for an hour and a half of idiot paradise, this is for you, if not rent or buy something else."
2,Dull Spaces,"The novel about a child living unhappily in a house (that could be haunted) with her relatives, may sound interesting.But it does not hold interest."
3,Hugo Rolling Walker with Seat,"I recently purchased the Hugo Rolling Walker with seat, because I have a bad back and cannot stand for long periods of time. Unfortunately, the seat surface is so small and uncomfortable, that I can not sit on it for any length of time either. I am a woman of medium build, so I can't imagine that anyone larger would find it comfortable. It does have various height adjustments and rolls very easily on most surfaces. If I were to buy another rollator, I would sit on it first to make sure it is comfortable."
3,Quality is good- more information about sizing is needed,"I don't know much about walkers, so just ordered this because the large wheels looked like they would roll easier than smaller wheels. unfortunately, It is too tall for the intended recipient. I would guess that you would need to be at lease 5'3'' to have this fit appropriately. I don't recall any sizing information provided in the product description.Also, it is pretty substantial for a smaller person. I would recommend going to a shop and taking some walkers for a spin. You may pay more, and it will consume some time, but you will get a product that will be more appropriate for your needs."
4,Standard. Easy to assemble,"I'm a therapist and I had purchased this for a patient. It was easy to assemble, sturdy. These have larger wheels which is better for uneven surfaces. but the rubber on the wheels seem to be less shock absorbant."
4,Rolling walker,The larger wheels are easy to use on carpeted floors and the bag beneath the seat is great for transporting items. Height adjustment is very good. The over all quality control is adequate but could be better. It is not as easy to fold as some other walkers and is difficult to get in the back seat of some vehicles; thus the 4 stars instead of 5.
5,Very high quality at a reasonable price.,"Replaced a 5 yr. old Hugo walker of the same model proving how durable these walkers are. The frame has a very solid feel and everything assembled with a solid ""click"". My 90 yr. old dad likes the color and appreciates the solid braking system. If you've seen the prices of other walkers and compare the features, construction and durability of this walker to the others, it will be an easy decision. I highly recommend this walker if this is the type of walker needed."
4,Rolling Walker Review,Everything about this item is excellent with one exception. It is difficult to fold down to traveling configuration. I am on oxygen and it wears me out to close it down or open it up.
5,Great rolling walker,Got the walker for my father who is 85 and needs help getting around. It helps with the walking and standing more upright.. The seat and storage compartment are handy. Great walker at a great price.
5,Keep on rolling,I found the product very easy to put together. Direction were the best. Using iit is very easy and has proven on of my best buys.
1,A piece of junk !,This was a big mistake. The front wheel assembly got loose and fell off - first one then the second one and they were impossible to replace correctly. I disassembled it and threw it in the trash.
3,"Sturdy, comfortable, but a part broke immediately","My Dad loves how it handles, the comfortability, and the sturdyness of the walker, but after the second use, the knob you pull to fold it up broke."
2,XLNT design 2 flaws get low rating,"HUGO Rolling Walker, BlueCostco quit carrying Hugo Rollators. Amazon reviews are 'required reading' on my purchases from any source.FLAWS:1-Wheels near feet can be put inside frame causing TOE damage for diabetic neuropathy or other users.2-Bolt holding wheel and bearing swivel to frame works loose and allows wheel to fail unless wobble noticed. I have returned at least one during early weeks [to Costco] for this. My current one was repaired from older ones.Features for me buying 4 or 5 of these.-push lock brakes-NO TOOL assembly-Large wheels-bag vs basket-lock open / close [had to put bright tape on knob so aids could see it]Minor problems:-brake not adjusted right - immediate return.-seat could use more padding - I use as chair mostly in houseIf these 2 flaws were definitely fixed I would continue buying Hugo Rollator."
4,Hugo Walker,"I bought this walker for my wife who had difficulty walking. She was able to get around much better with this walker. The price was very reasonable, other places wanted as much as $148.00 for the same walker, plus freight, so I was very pleased with the price. Also no shipping charges was great."
4,Great melodic angst and melancholy.,"The Palace comparisons are apt, but Jason Molina is a much better singer than Oldham. The songs are more defined than the semi-elegant shambles you'll find on a Palace record, which, over the course of an entire album, is a fine thing indeed. Nice backing vox from Edith Frost too."
4,Whats bigger? the heart or the sleeve?,"Man I just love songs:ohia!! I've never been one to like my music cutsey-clean sterile, base, or overproduced. This release is rough in all the right ways--pure, honest, soulful delivery in voice and instrument. Fans of Red House Painters might wanna check this one out. I really liked this release but had to give it only 4 stars because I think S:O's ""Impala"" is a slightly better disc. (finding out info on this band is really difficult. So if anyone, Jason if yr read ing yr reviews, has any tour info send me a note.)"
5,4 DVD at a great price.............,"Truly an excellent purchase, as you get 4 DVD movies for a really good price. Denzel Washington just doesn't make a bad movie. ""Fallen"" was totally unexpected. A very odd premise, but very worth watching until the end. ""Training Day"" was really full of twists and turns and the plot was incredibly complicated. When you finally understand what has happened, you realize how much you missed by watching it only one time. The other 2 were great acting on his part. He just is one of our finest actors. The DVD was sent quickly and arrived in excellent condition."
3,"Okay, But Somewhat Dissapointing","This case is a bit flimsy and the latches are a little suspect. The 8 eyepiece slots are sized for the standard 1.25"" Plossi eyepieces, but larger eyepieces like the Orion Edge-On series fit poorly and the Stratus Wide Field eyepieces don't fit in those round slots at all. Other than that, the case is well padded, has lots of storage options for various accessories and it is much better than nothing. I found a better option in a surplus case at work that I was able to customise, so I am no longer using this case. I will, however, add that this is the ONLY Orion supplied product I own that has been disappointing."
5,Dog Treats,My dog loves these treats. I can get him to do anything using them. They were much cheaper using Amazon even with the shipping charges.
1,MELTED,BY THE TIME I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT ALL 3 PACKAGES WERE MELTED SO ALL HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN EACH BAG HAD MELTED TOGETHER
5,My dogs love them,My dogs (and some other dogs I like to spoil too) just love these. They are their special treats.
3,Amazon has bad fitment info,Does NOT fit a 2008 MINI Cooper S (R56).. contrary to Amazon's fitment info.3 stars because I can't leave that part blank.
4,Cities of The Gods,"This is one book in a seies that includes the architecture of such places as China, Egypt, Islamic India and such styles as Gothic and Romanesque architecture. The book describes the legacy of the pre-Columbian past in modern Mexican architecture. The black and white photographs of the Aztec and Mayan pyramids are throughout but also included are the lesser known Zapotecs of Monte Alban and Mixtecs of Mitla, to name just a few. There are aerial views, drawing plans of sites and spendid close ups of the pyramids. The text is highly informative as it gives a history lesson as well. This is a good book if you are interested in the pyramids as structures that have withstood the test of time. Archeology buffs will enjoy this book as all the major sites in Mexico are covered. The plates serve as good material for any reconstruction of the pyramids for building models, drawings or paintings. A good book to have in the pre-Columbian section of your library on Mexico."
3,Too weak to be the perfect potful,"Even though it showed this item as in stock, it took 3 weeks to arrive with free shipping. The coffee has a nice aroma, but there is no way you will get 100-120 cups of coffee out of this product unless you are drinking coffee flavored water. You really need 2 packets to make a decent pot. People like me who drink black coffee and are interested in flavor may even need to use slightly more. For those who add cream and sugar, perhaps you can live with this, but for a true coffee drinker, it isn't worth the money. I put the packets in coffee cans just to see how it measured up. The entire box is equal to about 2 small cans of coffee which you could purchase in the store for $10 or less (decaf). Once I realized I could only get 4 cups from a packet, it did taste good."
2,Comes with only one set,"Purchased this kit since I purchased a Dorman Brake Master Cylinder. The Brake Master Cylinder did not contain a kit so I had to purchase this separately. Since my brake master cylinder has two holes, you would think that the kit comes with two plugs with the same size thread. It does not! You would have to purchase two of these kits to have a matching set."
2,Sweaty,"First off, let me say that I paid $46 (queen size) for this pad 2 weeks ago, I don't know what is up with the $109 price. The pad is well made, it fits fine on the bed and it is a tad cushy what with the terry cloth top. What I didn't know when I bought it is that is has a waterproof or maybe just water resistant backing. I think this is what makes for a sweaty night's sleep. Very uncomfortable."
2,Whimsical,"This is the whimsical tale of a young girl who wakes up one day with a full set of enormous antlers on her head. As the story progresses, her mother is prone to fits of fainting as she ponders what to do with a daughter who has antlers. The silly and sometimes absurd events which take place in this book are sure to ignite a young child's imagination. Illustrations in this book help enhance the perception of silliness in this book which will undoubtedly cause fits of laughter in young readers.While this book is short on plot and lacking in literary structure, I believe children will enjoy the story for its humorous moments.~DeeDee Fox, Author of The Ruby Red Slippers"
2,Short on conflict,"This book has received great reveiws far and wide. I hate to admit it, but I just don't see why. The protagonist, Imogene, wakes up with a set of antlers on her head. To many of us, this would be a big problem. But, Imogene doesn't seem to mind all that much. Her family, however, hates the whole idea. Now, in most children's story books, the protagonist is faced with a certain conflict and at the end of the story he/she has solved it and has grown somehow from the experience. In this story, Imogene isn't bothered by her problem and does nothing at all to solve it. In fact, the problem solves itself. She wakes up and voila, no more antlers. Instead, she had grown a new problem. (Another that she doesn't seem to mind.) In no way do I see that either Imogene or her family has grown or changed in any way. I admit, some of the situations are comical and in their own way pull the book along. But again, there is no solution to the problem and I have issue with that."
5,One of...,"My favorite children's books! I was an Kindergarten and preschool teacher for 24 year and raised three children alone. I love books and tried to instill the love of books into all the children I have been in contact with-personally and professionally. This is an old fashioned story about a girl who wakes up one morning with antlers on her head and tells of all of the silly things her household tries to do with this new headpiece! I love the ridiculousness of it all and it leads to some great ""what if""discussions with children. This was bought to replace one that went missing. Read it and your child will love it!"
5,Imaginative and exquisite,"This is an exquisite book to lure children into reading - I simply told them, ""look, this girl woke up with antlers on her head!"" and that got them hooked on to the pages till the end. Young Imogene has accepted her transformation with good humor and though dressing, walking and sliding down the stairs may prove to be tricky, she's having as much fun as she could with her new-sprouted antlers despite her mom's constant fainting. Beautiful illustrations to spark lively imagination, IMOGENE""S ANTLERS were used to dry towels by the kitchen maid, to carry doughnuts out to feed the birds, to hold dozens of candles for her young brother and what's more amusing also is to see the other serious adults who try so desperately to hide the impossible. Imogene goes to bed with a big smile and wakes the next morning with no antlers but just when mom is relieved to see her little girl back to normal, voala comes another exciting new surprise!"
5,great book,"My daughter and I love this book. It was one that I read as a child, and now am enjoying again. It describes Imogenes day....she woke up with antlers and just takes it all in stride - it's her family that has a hard time coping with it. My daughter especially loves the end, where (spoiler!) Imogene goes to bed, wakes up and the antlers are gone, but now she has a peacocks tail! Very funny, simple, thought provoking book on accepting and dealing with what comes."
4,"Silly, pointless bit of fun :)","Imogene woke up one day with antlers. Happens to the best of us, right?Well, this does cause a few problems, but she adapts readily. Sure, her mother may faint and her principal may glare, but antlers! You can put doughnuts on them for the birds, and candles to light the room.The problem goes away as quickly and mysteriously as it came (this is no Bad Case of Stripes), but it's met with a new one - a peacock's tail!There's no big moral or revelation in this book, it's just a silly story."
5,Glimpses into the Hidden World!,Duplicates somewhat with Nightmare tales but not enough not to buy this book if you enjoy reading about the occult (and by this I mean esoteric thought in its highest sense) and just want short and darn fascinating reads.
4,Not too shabby,"I heard a song from this album on the Pandora radio website. I liked the song so much that I bought the disks. The rest of the music on the album isn't like it at all. It is definitely GOOD music, don't get me wrong but had I known that it was going sound like this I wouldn't have bought it. If you want some hip yet generic-sounding background music for your next dinner party, get this 2 disc set."
1,Don't Bother!,"The first half of this book is a tough read, it's tedious and boring,a spitting out of facts like your giving data from a history book. Later, as the author brings his account into more modern times, it gets a little better. One thing I did learn from Indian Running was about their stone-age beliefs and rituals that many tribes still hold on to. I always thought that mistreatment by the ""white man"" had to be the primary reason for the Indian's plight today but I'll tell you this,their stone-age beliefs and ""spirituality"" hasn't helped either. Oh yeah, Nabokov's casual and almost dismissive recounts of the butchering of missionaries is laughable. I suppose in his eyes, these well-intentioned but misguided folk had it coming to them? Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Dissatisfied with ink refill kit,"I purchased the InkStation Multi-Brand Refilling Kit for HP and other printers, followed the instructions and it did not work. I have used other inks from Walmart and Target previously without problem. The cartridge blotted ink perfectly well also and did not run dry. I think the ink was defective and not suitable for filling cartridges."
1,questionable ink formula,I tried this ink in 4-5 cartridges and it all leaked out. I do not think this ink formula works for my Canon cartridges.
3,Ink Job,"Lots of black fluid to fill cartridges and that is why I bought it. One of the bottles came with a leak in it, but otherwise it worked okay. Thus, it was a messy job."
1,Didn't work at all,This was a terrible product. I will stick to new cartridges. I didn't spend a lot for this so I am ok with the out come.
4,Printing at a thousandth of the retail price!,"An incredible amount of fluid for such a small amount of money! Easy to use.One thing, be very careful that your ink cartridge will 'allow' you to use refilled ink. Lexmark really rips off people with there specially licensed cartridges that somehow register the cartridge in the printer and know if it is dead. The industry is like that, so research before you get frustrated!"
4,Does what it's supposed to do,The ink filled the cartridge quickly because of the side-dispence design of the tip. The black ink is a little darker than the original cartridge. For general use it is perfect. I have used ink refills before and this is the easiest and least messy I have used.
3,Beginner's Pluck,"As one who grew up in the town on Long Island that became the title for Billy Joel's debut album, this collection has special significance to me. Of all the songs, only ""She's Got A Way"" has received any radio air play over the years (a later version, performed live). Still, for anyone who has grown-up listening to his music (or, simply grown to love it), this seminal work is worth the modest investment."
4,Very nice yet underrated effort,"This is a very nice collection. ""Why Judy Why"" is such a soft, sweet ballad, and one of the best songs on the album. My favorite Billy Joel ballad, ""She's Got A Way"" is in fine form here, too. Yet I think the song sounds better on ""Songs From The Attic"". Billy Joel's first album!"
5,Short But Oh So Sweet,"Excellent from start to finish. Where can one start. Each song seems to have a very distinguishing quality: the strings on Why Judy Why, the soulful vocals on Tommorow Is Today, and the good time rhythm of You Look So Good To Me. Its a shame these songs don't get more play on radio. They are true gems."
3,"""Cold Spring Harbor"" was Billy Joel's first album in 1971.","I believe ""Cold Spring Harbor"" was a typical starting-off album. This album was unique in several aspects. First, his piano playing was excellent. During this point in time in Billy Joel's life, he was not too much of a musician, however, he made up for it in his piano playing. His voice was not exactly the best at the time. Metaphorically, I think Billy Joel's voice at this time was like a baseball glove. It need a lot of working in. Billy Joel thinks the same thing about this album. He does not even own a copy of this album. When this album was originally recorded in 1971, Artie Ripp, the record manager allowed the album to be recorded at the wrong speed. Thus, it was to fast. Billy Joel says he sounded more like Alvin the Chipmunk than himself. It was than rereleased at the correct speed in 1983 by Phil Ramone."
5,Feelings from deep inside,This album touches your heart like nobody else has. It has a very speical meaning. Just like Luther Vandross this album takes you where you might have been or think you are going
1,Useless as a Kindle book,"One star only because it appears that is the lowest you can go. I bought this book just a few minutes ago based on all the great reviews. It turns out that all those reviews were of the print edition whicbh seems to be a great resource. Unfortunastely there appears to be no way to navigate the Kindle edition. If you try find a word using the search function you get not the location of the definition but everywhere the word is used in the entire volume. I telephoned help and the only suggestion other than the search function was to see if this bookcould be made the default dictionary,but this has to bve done on trhe computer and cannot be done suing the Kindle itself. That is wildly impractical. I ended up getting a refund and having the book removed from my unit.I may go out and get the print edition but this Kindle version appears to be simply unusuable."
3,"Bowdlerizing the Bard, or, Where are the Naughty Bits?","This review should be taken as somewhat tentative, as I haven't yet had much experience using the book. That being said, it is clear that this resource shies away from explaining the ""naughty bits"" that so enlived Shakespeare's double entendres (sorry, groundlings). For example, The rather more vulgar meanings of ""count"" and ""county"" are nowhere to be found in this book. Surely we are sophisticated enough to understand these things for what they are in the context of Elizabethan drama. I guess I'll just have to buy another book for that.In addition, this book notes that ""poinards"" are weapons, without saying anything about what a ""poinard"" is. Well, duh, I could get that idea from the context and hardly need a glossary to tell me that!"
5,I adore my Shakespeare's Words Companion!,I am delighted with this product and how quickly it shipped to me. It was in excellent condition and will be a highly useful companion for my Shakespeare studies at University.Thank you Amazon!!
4,It was great!,"It has wonderful lyrics. Some artists have songs that don't make any sense, but that is not the case with Becca. She has a wondeful talent that she is using for God's glory. The song ""Hands Tied"" is so moving. It talks about the loving mercy of the Lord, and how He will love you no matter what you do. I hope this review has helped you."
3,Servicable Sea Stories,These Adam Hardy sea stories are worthy reads for those who have become hooked on the genre from having read the works of the maestro Patrick O'Brian. They are not on the same level of humor and erudition. But they're not bad at all.
4,Thought Provoking,"To retire or refire? What does the future hold? ""Claiming Your Place at the Fire"" helps us ask the right questions as we try to make sense out of and find meaning in the second half of our lives. It is full of insight on how to do that in a way that makes sense for a variety of people in all sorts of situations. It was very helpful to me as I weigh the options in my life and work. Thought provoking and conversation starting."
5,Fun cd..,Nice and funky live concert :-)...Good vocal presentation indeed. The musicians are quite good. And good recording for those who like that :-)
5,The little guy is back!,"My dog got to the one my girlfriend owned and chewed it up. I couldn't find one on the Ty website because it had been retired. Imagine my excitement when I found out there was one available! And, she loved it as a stocking stuffer on Christmas!"
5,This is the answer key to an AWESOME product,This is the answer key. It is very useful if you want to check your work and it isn't very expensive.Below is my review for the Alif Baa: Introduction to Letters and Sounds set (just to help you while you are looking).This is the answer key to a product that is AWESOME! The explanations are very clear. The listening exercises give students exposure to colloquial Egyptian Arabic. The listening exercises also help the learner to distinguish between letter sounds and reinforce their letter sound pronunciation.You really should buy this if you are learning Arabic. It is that useful!
3,Alright for what it is,Fine answer key. Very Useful but not completely necessary for study in Alif Baa.
2,"Some Problems Answers Only, Others Only a Very Brief Solution","I find the Six Minute Solutions book and the 101 Solved Civil Engineering books much better. Those books give you solved solutions to the problem, where the Practice Problems book for some of the sections only gives you answers, like A. I've been trying to work through this book but it is frustrating when you get stumped that there is no where to go and see how the problem was solved. Wish it had a companion with the full solutions. The ones that do give you the solutions make assumptions and do not list them. I would also highly recommend getting the Sample Problems book offered through NCEES."
2,ridiculous softcore,"This film was released the same year as Keanu's ""Matrix."" I wonder if it purposely related to that or if it was by chance. My guess would be the former because this film does have some cheesy black-and-green imagery that is very imitation-Matrix.This was typical softcore: bad acting, silly plot, lots of female bisexuality but no male bisexuality, etc. This is really just an opportunity to see cosmetically-enhanced bosoms. Like all heteropatriarchal films, this one shows far more female nudity than male nudity. The sexual scenes were obviously fake too.The one fascinating part of this film were male torsos. The actors obviously do work out. However, I wonder if there pectorals are bought just like their female counterparts. All the characters are white, yet not a single man has a single chest hair. If you've even been in any male locker room in middle America, you would know that this is highly unrealistic."
5,Passion and Joy in Abundance !,"To my ears, Perahia excells himself, and all the competitiors, on this disc. With this two highly contrasting Concertos he shows his fingers, his mind, his taste, his utmost musicality, but, above all, his soul, going from euforia to despair and back again with commitment and high artistry. Tempos are perfectly judged and all the feelings of joy and tragedy convincingly coveyed. For me, this is the best release of his Mozart cycle ! And one of the best of his whole output ! Do not miss it !"
1,Still have not received the product.,This purchase was suppose to arrive at my home between 4/20 and 5/10. Today is 5/20 and it still has not arrived. I have sent an email back to the seller with not response. This is the first time I have purchased from Amazon and I am very disappointed.
5,This is how it should be,"Absolutely incredible album from these guys. After the ""unplugged"" sound of ""Swing..."" I thought we might have lost them, but they came back in spades here. ""Hand of the Father"" is an incredible song...well, actually, almost ALL of them are. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Guardian tests the Grunge waters,"Released in 1995, ""Buzz"", was Guardian's third record with Jamie Rowe on vocals, and fourth record overall. ""Buzz"" marked a sharp change in direction for the band, opting for a more modern/alternative sound, and totally dropping the melodic-rock sounds of their past.While i'm not a fan of grunge/alternative music, and I can't stand it when 80's bands tried to fit to the trend, Guardian did a very admirable job at becoming grunge. The band went for a more Collective Soul sound, than that of Soundgarden or Pearl Jam. Eventhough I wasn't blown away with this album, it did have some solid cuts throughout. Songs like ""Them Nails"", ""This Old Man"", ""The Lions Den"" and ""Lead The Way"" standout, but no song really brings the record down.If you like Guardian, or are a fan of grunge music, you may want to check this album out. Others who remember Guardian's previous releases may want to avoid it, but I liked it quite a bit, and I don't like grunge music."
3,Almost everything I needed,"I purchased the 6-Piece Blender Accessory Refresh Kit to replace a blender top for my old blender. Even though the product said that it would fit most ""cube"" type blenders, this top unfortunately was too big for the model I had. Everything else that came with the kit fit my blender but I ultimately ended up returning it. If you plan to purchase this kit try to make sure that the top will fit your blender model."
4,This item met my expectations,This little kit allowed me to resurect my well worn blender blade and other components. It was more economic than buying a new blender and greener too.
1,not a good quality product,"poorly made, worse than the one I needed to replace i would recommend to by an original and not badly made immitations"
3,This item was fine but lid does not fit tight!,"If this product is made by Oster as the packaging indicates, it is a cheap version of the original.....however, I purchased my blender some 20+ years ago, and like a lot of other things, the replacements are not as good, as sturdy as the originals. &#128530;"
4,Oster 6010 6 Piece Accessory Kit works,I have used this kit with my blender for almost a month and have had no problems. If you are missing any accessories with this type of blender I would purchase these ones without any hesitation.
4,great value,"This was a great value to get all of these pieces for such a low price. You for sure save money than if you would buy them individually. I can only give 4 stars because the blender top/lid did not fit my Osterizer classic blender correctly. It was too big, I could actually pull it around the entire top instead of sitting it on the inside like it is supposed to fit. I didn't need the lid so it wasn't a huge deal to me and I got it free anyway with such a great bundle price but it would have been nice to have an extra. All of the other parts fit great."
2,counterfeit or shoddy product,The cap and gaskets appear to be the same quality as my original parts but the blade and bottom are shoddy knockoffs or really lousy Oster parts. The blade and bottom shown on the packaging are not what was in the box. The bottom is half as thick as the original. Since it was a broken bottom that caused me to go looking for replacement parts I am most disappointed. The replacement blade is not manufactured to the same quality standard as the original either. Poorly made and assembled. I am contacting Amazon about the difference between the photos online and on the box. These cheap parts are not what I thought I was purchasing.
5,Works perfectly and fits properly,Each piece in this kit fits our blender exactly as it should and works correctly.
4,works for me,"Everything works fine, except that the lid doesn't fit my blender (it's too big). Anyone want a lid? The product appears to be a legit replacement kit, unlike some of the other products available on amazon that appear to be chinese rip-offs."
1,Not FOR OSTER KITCHEN CENTER,"Cover didn't fit my blender jar, it was too big I could actually pull it around the entire top instead of sitting on the inside like it is supposed to fit. If all I wanted was a blade and a base I could have got it for $2.60 + 4.99 S+H (see Oster 4961) This was just a big waste of money, but Amazon did take it back . Buyer Beware!!"
3,good product,it really is the only choice when you need the parts.my only complaint is the black plastic screw on bottom.the plastic is thin and a good hard twist will break it.clearly someone at oster figured out how to cut costs here.someday oster will have a competitor in the blending machine marketand if they make a robust strong unit oster will be history.
1,"Does not fit my blender, but its an Oster.","There is nothing on this product page that gives information about which Oster blenders this product fits. Apparently, Oster makes 2 different commonly-used blender jars. Sadly, thiis product does not fit my blender. More information on this page would have saved me both time and money, and the seller a bad review. Please update this pae so the next person looking for replacement parts goes the right one."
1,How about a review that TELLS US SOMETHING?,"The preceding 'review' is totally worthless. It says nothing about the music, or the quality of the recording! Like so much of the mindless babbling by those who think they've been 'saved' the reviewer just bleats about Jeeee-zus. What a waste!"
2,Back in the day,"I have read and enjoyed a few of Wolff's biographical novels and thought I would try his short stories. I probably should have started with something more recent. Each of the stories in this collection focuses on dark aspects of everyday life: drug abuse, familial discord, sub-par soldiers and cheating spouses, to name a few. Unfortunately, none of the situations rang true to me - they read like sketches that someone would write in a fiction workshop. The language is also dated and has not held up well over time - 80's slang for drug use is almost comical when uttered by cardboard characters.Many great writers agree that Wolff is one of the best short-story writers of his generation. I am willing to believe this assertion but I am guessing it is not based upon this collection."
4,Not so well known gem.,"I purchased this recording for a number of reasons.To begin with, the lable is one of the finest that Europe has to offer. Secondly, Boulez is one of the most fascinating musians of the past half century. Also, this work is relatively limited in availability, so for the price I don't mind the short playing time. I found the wide variety of textures of this splendid music most delightful."
4,Speaking For Millions,"Mr.Gleek knows his stuff. This book is broken down into bite size pieces. Open to any page and get at least one good idea. This book is also a perfect example of how to use a self-published book as a combination business card, promotional tool, and catalog. The only reason I didn't give the book a 5, is that much of the content is repeated in Mr. Gleeks other book; MARKETING & PROMOTING YOUR OWN SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS.I don't mean the same ideas, I mean whole sections, word-for-word. If I had not bought both books, I would have been totally satisfied with this one."
4,Fine product!!,"Great product!It's very good 'feeling' to hear again this music,...Excelent quality,....!,...but one of my most prefered song is missing from the soundtrack,......that is, why I've rated this item '4 stars' only"
5,"Fine music, remarkable film.","At last, the music (soundtrack) of this remarkable film. The music is so fine and was written and directed by one of the best music film composers. Every note remind us the drama of the film."
4,Ashton's Review,"Pure NRG is great! Jordan Ryan Yates, Caroline Grace Elizabeth Williams, & Laura Carolyne Joyce Myers all have great singing voices. I like their dance moves. I bet later on, they'll all be doing full tucks. But for right now, Carolyne needs to work more on her back tuck. Maybe she'll have it by SUMMERTIME'My friend & I LOVE the song This Madness. I like ""Pray"" & ""Live my life for you"". I also like the song ""Someday"". So far so good! Anybody that likes a lot of excitement will like Pure NRG! They sing the song ""Footloose"" (I love that song, too) & it will get you pumped up. They may be young, but they are fun. I want people to listen to the band, then see if they like it or not. People always try to find some type of music that they like. Pure NRG might be for you."
4,The kids love it!,"I was relieved to find pureNRG, especially now that Jump 5 has disbanded. It's fun, funky and clean music. My kids (9 and 7) really enjoy the album, and it has proven to be a satisfying alternative to Hannah Montana and The Cheetah Girls. I recommend it for those looking for clean, non-boyfriend/girlfriend music for their tweens!"
2,Bad experience,"A very uncomfortable fit. Not that supportive as well.Perhaps I bought on too small, but Large is usually ample for my needs; this was not."
2,Wrist Brace was a problem,I rated this two stars because this wrist brace was advertised as large but it was too small for my hand. I returned it to the vendor for a refund but have gotten nothing back from them. I presume that it is a loss. Advice to users of Amazon: don't buy items that are not sent directly from Amazon. Amazon will refund your money every time. The other vendors never refund the money; they take your money and do not refund it even if you go to the trouble of returning the item. Buyer Beware!!
2,Provides little support. Pretty lousy actually,"I recently sprained my wrist and needed a brace to support it. I jumped on this one for the price and because it was difficult to drive the first few days, and delivery to my door seemed like a convenient option. BUT, This product provides barely any support and does not feel sturdy at all. I have since bought one at walgreens for a few dollars more and it is MUCH better than this. I don't recommend at all if you need good sturdy support. A few extra dollars spent on my health is worth it to me!"
3,Wish it had another joint,"The works fine and does what its supposed to do, but anyone who has used one of these before knows its easier to get the light at a perfect angle and spot the more joints you have. This really only has one joint and its really hard to clamp it on and have it face directly down. Its not a huge deal, but would make the product better. It will work for now.I am using withZoo Med Reptile Basking Spot Lamp 100 Watts 2 Bulb Value PackUpdate: December 2012The area that holds the bulb has come loose and it is really hard to get the bulbs in and out. The socket still works fine but it is extremely loose now."
2,had to rewire both that i purchased.,"I was getting a light flicker, or issues with it just not turning on, and when i opened it up, I noticed that the wire was exposed from rubbing on the inlet hole. I opened the second one to find the same thing.. dangerous...I was able to cut and rewire them and no problems since.. I tossed one out in favor of a larger clip lamp from lowes which i would recommend over these due to the better quality, longer plug, higher wattage, and lower price."
1,they sent me a smashed lamp.,It was crunched up like a tin-can but the box was in perfect shape. with a bit of hammering i returned it to a working shape.
3,mwhite,"After looking at a couple of stores, and online Amazon had this for the least amount of money. I received it very quickly, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found the lamp was dented, I'm not going to bother with sending it back, after all I did not order it for the looks. It works great, puts out a lot of heat, much more than I expected,it is a little hard to get the right angle so that the light hangs right over the tank, had to get a bit creative, but overall very happy."
3,Tough to put together,"The clamp lamp was a little tough to put together, but I do like it. It's sturdy and holds on to things well."
4,Swashbuckler Three,"I really enjoyed this book, the characters were engaging, the story was good, and the descriptions were wonderful. Action and humor were the two words I'd most likely assign to this book, and in reality the whole series. The Two Harper Lads that travel with Sharantyr, youngest of the Knights of Myth Drannor, are just hilarious. I spent most of my time laughing, I think that's why it took me so long to finish. I recommend this series, especially if you're a fan of the realms. The only thing I found lacking, really, was the odds. Three rangers and Elminster versus that many Zhentilar? And El hardly casts because Magic is unstable? That's my only complaint."
1,God awful like all Grenwood books,"I have read a large number of these books, but I just can't stand the shallow banter that goes on forever in this book. I literally could not finish this book."
3,Very good but a small amount over done.,"The idea was very good, but the odds were a little bit bad. Probably the best parts were the Battle seens in High Dale."
1,"Terrible, even for Greenwood","Based on some of the other reviews, it looks like some people actually enjoy reading about Ed Greenwood's invincible characters. I find them predictably boring. It takes much more than mindless hack and slash to tell a story. Greenwood's vocabulary must be limited, since I see the same words repeated again and again <""rueful"" sigh>."
5,This dvd is changing my life.,"I have never enjoyed working out and have never been athletic. In fact, I have always been lazy when it comes to exercise. This dvd is changing my perception. I love the challenge and the sweat. I know that each time I use this dvd, I get better at it and am becoming more coordinated. I love that when I'm doing the exercises, I'm encouraged to think and say positive things rather than to get tired and give up. Because of the amazing feeling this dvd gives me, I try to do it several times a week. Patricia Moreno is an amazing, supportive instructor and I can't wait for her to make more IntenSati workout dvds."
5,Great Body/Mind Workout,"I don't think I could be happier with this DVD. The workout is excellent, and incorporates a lot of good balancing and stretching in addition to the cardio. It's definitely burning calories and releasing those endorphins!In terms of the inspirational aspect of it, I do find that the affirmations help me stay centered and power through the harder parts of the workout. She chooses some great phrases to use that boost my positive energy and self image. However, they get a little New Age-y for me, sometimes.Overall, I can hardly complain. I think this is a great DVD, and I find myself feeling physically, mentally, and spiritually relaxed after going through it. I would recommend this in a New York minute to anyone I know."
5,Mind and body workout!,This is an intense workout but she works our mind and body all at the same time. Even if you are not in great shape she tells you how to slow it down and you still feel like you are a part of what she is doing. I love Patricia Moreno because she has been there with us and she is just sharing how she got past it all to help us. It does!! She is wonderful. It is like you are in her class and she is helping you one on one.
1,Intensati,I wish I had seen the content before I purchased it. I didn't find her combinations and moves very intense and she talked way too much.
1,Overrated - Don't Listen To The Hype,"I am a home-workout fanatic. I have tried many different videos and read reviews carefully before going out on a limb. In this case, it was a bad gamble.First of all, this workout doesn't even qualify as a workout. It is very overbearing with the new-agey ""spiritual"" stuff. Even when she's not talking about meditation, there is always an eastern prop of some kind in the foreground. I am all for ""spirituality"", although mine is not so eastern in nature. This was SO much it made me nauseous.While I can appreciate other people's traditions/beliefs, this video did not guide you through your own PERSONAL journey. It invited you into theirs - which didn't suit me at all. I was very disappointed."
4,Volume #1: The World According to George: 30 minutes in EP mode !,"I would have given this tape 5 stars had it been recorded in SP mode and had more than 30 minutes of cartoons on it!The few cartoons are:1) (George of the Jungle) THE MALADY LINGERS ON - Shep the elephant is sick but the witch doctor's perscription is hazardous to George.2) (Super Chicken) THE WILD HAIR - A mad scientist's living toupee runs amuck!3) (Tom Slick) THE SWAMP BUGGY RACE - Dirty cheat Baron Otto Matic disguises himself as a lady to bug Tom in the Ira K. Dismal Swamp Buggy Race!4) (George of the Jungle) THE DESTERATE SHOWERS - When the Bumbashootie witch doctor decides to sacrifice Ursala to Juju the rain god, George puts a damper on his plans!"
5,Great Love Scenes,"I have been trying to track this particular CD down for ages. I first purchased it in the early 80's and was delighted when I managed to find it again on Amazon.com. This album is perfect if you are hovering on the edge of Opera. The songs on it are ones that you know well but never really knew which composer, which opera etc. There is no doubt that Bocelli, whether the opera buffs like it or not, is having a profound effect on 'opera for the masses'. If you admire Bocelli you will also enjoy this as the arias are light and very beautiful. Domingo, Scotto, Kiri and Ileana are fabulous. This is a great introduction to those who are new to opera and do not want to be put off by anything too heavy."
3,"Not just ""kids"" serving our community","I am a recent City Year graduate from Chicago and I read Suzanne's book in the beginning of my City Year experience. Even though there is a five year difference in our corpmember experiences, her's being in the very beginning of City Year's exsistance. She tells the truth of how City Year can Help you and hurt you. It's Very hard work and having the story being portrayed from the earlier days of City Year, it's gotten even harder now. Personally I'm glad I did it. Proven we are not just ""kids"" serving our community but adults making our way in the world."
5,A must for all old Leica lens lovers,Very small but very handy.Includes MTF grafts for old leica lenses.It is a big help in defining the birth of old lenses from the serial numbers.
3,To big,Everything is ok with the t-shirt but the size XL is really too big and too long so consider if You really need XL...
3,Good in its day,"I bought this album when I was 14 or 15 on cassette tape. At that time I hadn't yet come into contact with the period performance and didnt really have access to that much music. I have never been able to find another recording of the FI No. 100 concerto so memorably performed by flute and violin on this album. My tastes have changed significantly over they years to where the performances are almost maudlin in their ponderous romantic interpretation. Nevertheless, this album in particular fostered an ongoing fascination with the music of Vivaldi."
4,Excellent Book for non-mathematicians,"A good book for engineers. Almost every computer scientist has, one time or another, wished he/she had a more solid background in Maths. This book addresses such reflections. Just when the contents get too abstract the author introduces some practical examples and drag the reader back into the reality. The first five chapters introduces the mathematical foundation of probability, distribution, random variables. The remaining book only gives the practical usage of these concepts. Any software engineer who wishes to do some research must read this book to be able to grasp the ideas of probability, random variables, curve fitting, data representation."
4,Great version,"This is one of the best version of this work i have heard, just as humble and touching as it shall be.Less severe as Leonhardt's version and less rythmic/energic than Goebel's version but really cosy and spiritual."
1,Can't believe I spent $100 on this book,"This book is a complete joke. I am a certified welder, and wanted to improve my fabrication skills.Not going to learn anything from this book, in fact I learned more in my junior high school metal shop class. Total waste of money."
5,glenn's review,it was avery good book to review i have never been so interested reviewing any book before. thank you
3,"Good, but misses most of the real gems","As a Phil Keaggy fan who's heard about 1/2 to 2/3 of all the music he had recorded at the time of this album's release, I think it misses many of his best songs. I still enjoy listening to most of these tracks, but most of them are average Keaggy songs. That isn't a bad thing, because the average Keaggy song is quite good--I just don't think this deserves the ""best of"" label."
5,Great Guitar Stories,"Buy this CD. It is wonderful and leaves you feeling relaxed. It gives off an amazing vibe that leaves you feeling renewed. Yuri is a guitar master, and I am so thankful that a friend introduced me to this CD. Buy this CD. The songs flow into each other at the perfect rate, each one sounding better than the next. It is simple, crisp and clear music at it's finest. It should be entitled ""Great Guitar Stories."" Yuri is considered to be a hero in Russia, and he should be considered a hero to all that listen to this CD."
5,"Should be called ""Great Guitar Stories""","I cannot say enough good things about this CD. A friend introduced me to it, and I can't seem to stop listening to it. This man is the master of the guitar. The songs flow into each other at the perfect rate. You cannot help but to feel it's amazing vibe. This CD leaves you feeling relaxed and renewed. Listen to it at work, in the car, at home with a glass of wine. You will enjoy it. Buy this CD. Once again, buy this CD. You will not be disappointed, only uplifted. It is guitar at it's best."
2,what are dreams,I did not like this video. It was boring. I wanted to show it to a chemical dependency group but decided not to.
5,NOVA: What Are Dreams?,I liked this PBS program. I belong to a Dream Group that meets once a month to discuss dreams and their meanings. This gave me a new perspective on dreams and dreaming. The scientific look at dreams and how they help us to function in our world. I found this to be helpful and am sharing it with Dream Group members and see what they get from looking and listening to it.
4,Kind of a sleeper,"This video I got to show to a class of high school kids. I thought they would really enjoy learning about dreams and where they come from, what they mean and what to do about nightmares. This tape was ok but didn't make it as interesting as it could have been."
4,"Wonderfully Charming, But Too Many Previews","This is a wonderfully charming tape that has totally enthralled our 22 month old daughter. However, Disney has really gone overboard with the previews and ads at the beginning -- it takes 4 minutes and 45 seconds before the feature begins. We would gladly pay a little more to get a preview free feature."
5,great birthday movie,"I remember watching this on the day before my birthday as a kid and (as always) being enchanted and intrigued by the adventures of Pooh & Co. And yes, we got our mom to play ""Poohsticks"" with us EVERY time we walked over a bridge!Very gentle, sweet and entertaining video for young kids!"
2,"Quiet, and not worth the price","Hands down, this product is NOT LOUD ENOUGH. Works great if your engine isnt running but once your going you cant hear a word, and no I don't have hearing loss. Buy the stupid looking ear things, they work much better."
2,Cool but unreliable when it has to work,"I bought this recently. Quiet sleek and speakerphone is good and excellant gadget until you expect it work for its main purpose i.e. making phone calls.Pros:* Speaker phone clarity* Relativly easy to pair* Battery life* Though nowhere mentioned, USB charging works - that allows you to charge from your laptop!Cons:* You will get frustrated to do voice dial using this. If you get through, its your luck.* If your phone goes out of range, it doesnot automatically pickup.* Lots of background noise to the person at other end of the phone. (Not to you, as the speakerphone is very good)* It is meant to be fixed in the visor. But, only charger that comes is car charger and obviously you cannot charge while driving (dur to hanging chords at your face) or keep the engine/battery on just to charge this."
2,Blank screen,"The item is good but needs an upgrade.The wires feeding info to the screen can break from regularly opening and closing the screen.thus rendering the screen blank,yet still functioning."
4,Good buy,"The product I ordered: Virtual Reality Labs VRBT120PVR3 VRBT120P Bluetooth Speaker Car Kitwas to fill an immediate need.Shipping was very fast.The unit(s) are pretty much as described.My only con is; not enough volume.Even though the unit is on the visor above your face, it is notquite loud enough for clear understanding of caller's voice.Pro; people I called all said they could hear and understand mequite well, no ""huh?"" or ""say again!"".Initial pairing took over twenty minutes, but once paired theywork every time. Battery life is great.Except for the volume problem, this unit lives up to it's ad.Yes, I would buy this product again. I have already advisedfriends about it with the recommendation that they not use itfor example, with windows open, .NOTE: The item pictured is NOT what I ordered and received."
2,Ok performance. No Customer Service,"I bought this item from my local Costco and it worked reasonably well the first couple of weeks then I started experiencing unexplained power-off's. This happens regardless of duration or battery level. Sometimes it will power off after a few minutes and other times it will power off after half an hour and sometimes it stays on for a while. This problem happens around 80% of the time I use the device. I could not get any response from the manufacturer and I unfortunately lost the original receipt. Even though they say to not return the product, don't listen to it. Take/send it back to the store you bought it from.Other comments have been pretty much echoed by other reviewers, i.e. quiet, difficult to see display, not very user friendly. I can't imagine how they won the CES award."
3,A slightly flawed design,"I really love the convenience of this device. The charge lasts a long time, and it works great, except.....The volume isn't quite loud enough, and the microphone, when mounted on the visor, points straight down. I find that I have to lean in and nearly shout to be heard, even at low speeds with the windows up. It would be great if it could be mounted with the mic/speaker pointed toward my face as opposed to straight down."
2,stay away - bad product,"I bought this device and tried using it outside the US. while in the US it worked pretty fine (with the same mobile), but outside, the calling number just doesnt show up on the screen! if its all about the link b/w the mobile & the device, how should it matter where in the world it is being used?and don't bother trying their tech support forums - they do not allow users to post comments there!"
1,"Worked OK, then broken","First, I like the display that shows you the caller ID number for received calls, but there is very little other information that is displayed, more could have been done to improve the utility of that feature. For example, there is no indication on the screen on the speaker volume setting. The sound quality is marginal - the system supports voice dialing, for example, but I could never get my phone to recognize my saying ""home"" when using the speaker, when it works every time using the phone itself. Battery life was good, and recharging was easy. However, after about two months of pretty light use, the microphone stopped working altogether, so the unit is useless now."
1,Poor Design,"No problem connecting to a Samsung bluetooth cell phone, but the device is seriously handicapped by the fact that it automatically shuts off when charging. The charger requires DC from the car's lighter socket, which is available only when the car is running. But that's when I want to use it! Also the charger's curly cord is too short and must be stretched tight to reach the unit on the visor.Finally, the maximum volume is too soft to use comfortably in my Camry, which is not a noisy car.I plan to return it."
5,Worked Great,Just as described and about half the price if bought locally. Worked great. Would recommend the product and the company.
2,Sale did not include what was displayed in picture (Model 9084-1),"Attwood Corporation 9084-1 Large Battery BoxSeller-Amazon LLCDelivered with NO Hold Down Strap. The picture on site when purchased included the strap as did the manufactures web site of same model. Could have purchased the next smaller box (27 battery series) which included Hold down strap AND hardware (for half the price), but it was half-inch to narrow for my battery. For this larger box, neither Hardware or strap included with (9084-1) model. Would have been appropriate to advise buyer the selling price does not include these items. Not a ""Bait and Switch"" but has the same after-taste for the buyer."
3,Not As Good As The Title...,"A creepy maniac is loose in Venice! He dons a scuba-suit, swims through the channels, and surfaces only to grab beautiful, young female victims. You see, this guy is a collector. He kills his prey in order to embalm them with his special serum. He then adds them to his growing shrine of perfectly preserved corpses. The cops are baffled, so it's up to a determined reporter to somehow crack the case. Can he locate and stop this fiend before further deaths? THE EMBALMER suffers from horrendous dubbing and a lack of suspense. No real shocks or thrills here. Recommended for diehard scuba-diving serial killer fans..."
1,A Waste of Time,"Duller-than-dirt film about a scuba diving serial killer who preys upon young women in Venice as a clean cut news reporter tries to get to the bottom of the whole ordeal. In a word: dry. Very dry. The Monster of Venice AKA The Embalmer has all the stiffness one of those corporate training videos in which the company recruits some employees to act out certain situations in the workplace and how to handle them, only with a vague horror theme. Robotic acting, horrendous dubbing, a complete lack of atmosphere, suspense, excitement, etc. Frankly, a complete waste of time.On a side note, I only checked this movie out because guitar virtuoso Buckethead supposedly uses a sample from it in his song ""The Embalmer"". For those interested, I actually was not able to locate said sample in this release of the movie. Perhaps I missed it, I certainly will not suffer through this again to find out. Avoid. */****"
5,Ted Does it Again,"Ted L. Nancy, has done it again. I didn't think it was possible to come remotely close to the side splitting humor in the first two books, but he managed to do it for a third time.""Extra Nutty"" had me in tears (from laughing) right from the start. As usual, I don't want to finish the book immediately, so I'm only reading a few pages a day.Ted, or Jerry (who I honestly believe is the ""real"" author) please, please do a ""Nut"" book every year!"
5,One of the funniest,"Of all the prank letter books, Ted Nancy's are the funniest. The letters themselves are just fall on the floor funny. I was laughing so hard reading some of them, I was actually crying at times.My favorite, his writing to a barber shop. I won't give it away, it goes on for several letters. Even though the barber shop wouldn't let him reprint their letters, his side is so funny, I was crying.It has been a while since I have read the first two books in the series, so I can't compare this with those. But, this honestly couldn't have been any funnier.Buy this one. It is worth it."
5,BEYOND BELIEF,"I picked up the latest Ted book at my local book shop and found it to be the funniest of the 3. I have been a side-splitting, teary-eyed, laugh-out-loud Ted fan for several years now and wish I could buy a patch for what this guy is able to do to me. My friends all love the book and we sat around reading the letters outloud for hours. Ted you are either a true genius, or someone I never want to meet. Great Job!"
3,"Good stuff, but not as good as previous two","I enjoyed ""Letters from a Nut"" and ""More Letters from a Nut"" a great deal. While this book is extremely funny, and is worthy to stand next to its previous volumes, it isn't quite as good. Whereas in LFAN and MLFAN, Ted L. Nancy had a wild method of writing to various people/companies, in which he would make himself appear to be a real-but-nutty individual, many of the letters in EN:EMLFAN are pure gibberish. I imagine many of the recipients thought the jokes were typographical errors, and not the mark of a wackjob.In addition, the series of letters which appears to be the funniest is censored for some reason. This is not explained. If Seinfeld decided not to enclose the material for whatever reason, I could understand that, but I wish he would have either provided his reason or omitted the section entirely.Again, despite its weaknesses, EX:EMLFAN is a very funny book, and I highly reccomend buing it if you enjoyed LFAN and MLFAN."
5,great interviews on disk 2,"more than the movie itself, I found the interviews very interesting. The director and his collaborators and other critics are featured, which actually reveal very interesting details on the writing, preparation, and production. There is also a vintage newsreel from 1950, and from the actual real photographs of Giuliano and the sicilian village, you could see how realistic was the film set. One of a kind. They don't make movie directors like this anymore."
1,Can't use it,"The manufacturer's label is glued into the bowl where the water will go. The label doesn't peel off. Even though it says ""lifetime warranty"", I have been unable to track down this manufacturer online to take advantage of the warranty. I have tried to wash off the remains of the label with the best scrubbing sponge for non-stick dishes - I don't want to use a Brillo pad on it and damage the shiny finish. Since I can't risk the glue gradually dissolving in my dog's water, I can't use this bowl. A waste of my money."
2,"it is a ""no-tip"" but certainly not a no-push","The design of these bowls are neat and helps prevent the ears from getting wet, most of the time. However, the rubber rings around the bottom are not so neat. After just one washing I could predict trouble in the future but to my surprise, it was the very near future. After just a couple of washings, the rings came off completely and are stretched out and tore very easily. Still, the bowls get pushed around when being used by the dog. I find this to be very annoying when the rubber rings wereLoving Pets Standard No-Tip Dog Bowl, 32-Ouncea great expection for me when I made the purchase."
2,TOO BIG,"Unfortunately, this bowl's circumfrence is too large for my dogs. I might as well use a regular bowl."
2,Not narrow enough to keep ears clean !!!!,This bowl is not narrow enough at the top to keep a dogs ears clean. I have 2 full grown cockers and this exact bowl did not work to keep their ears out of the food. Do not buy this bowl if your buying for that purpose because it wont work !!!!
2,"Wouldn't Recommend For ""Long Eared Dogs""!","I have an English Cocker Spaniel. Her ears still got wet with these bowls. Also, it was easy for her to pull off the rubber that lines the bowl. I would have to keep putting it back on, which is a hassle. Eventually the rubber wore out and I was tired of trying to get it back on so I threw them out and get some better ones from PetCo that has rubber that cannot come off. I wouldn't recommend these for ""long eared dogs""! Also, the quality is not best."
2,A little too big,"I bought two of these for my Cocker Spaniel 4 month old puppies. I did not realize the mouth part would be that big so their whole face including their ears go in to the bowl. It kind of defeats the purpose of the dish being for long ear dogs. I put the bowls away for now and hope when they get older they will grow into them.Update: I tried to use these bowls now since they have chewed their plastic ones, but once they saw an image (themselves)in the mirrored part of the bowl they both ran away and will not come near their food. I guess buying them was a waste of money since they now are eating on paper plates...Who knew....."
2,Not impressed...,This bowl does tip and is not narrow enough to keep my dog's ears out of it. Not what it claims to be. I should have returned it.
3,my book review,"Sean and Nory are neighbors. They both set off to reach the same place, Nory's sister, Maggie's door. Sean lost his mother and brothe on the read, then he ran into a king that was stranded. The king told Sean that if he ran back to kis castle and sent someone with a horse than he would give hem food. Sean ran back to the castle and told the guard. The guard sent someone but wouldn't give him any food. Sean went to the kitchen door and the cook gave him food. Nory left on her journey with a small sack of food. She hurt her foot a lettle way through so she couldn't move as fast. She was at the beach about to eat some food and a girl walked up and took it. The girl gave her a plank of wood."
4,why did the Soviet Union collapse?,"In the immediate aftermath of the demise of the Soviet Union, this book contains essays by political scientists and intellectuals, attempting to understand the causes. En route, the reader also gets a side discussion of the academic field of Soviet studies, as practised in academia and government, outside the Soviet Union. In Britain, there is a synopsis of the internal politics of the field, focusing on Carr, a noted historian of Soviet affairs.Some chapters go way back to the 1917 Russian Revolution, to look at how Soviet communism was founded. In part to find causes of its ultimate failure.The text also has predictions for the future of Russia. Suggesting that it will remain a regional great power. Certainly, in the rest of the 90s, this might have seemed dubious, under Yeltsin's chaotic and incompetent administration. But after 7 years of Putin, and the rise in oil prices, that prediction seems accurate."
1,No Audio Selection for the Blu Ray,I could not find the audio set up for this Blu-Ray from the top menu. There should be a choice for an audio set up but there is not. I have never seen a blu ray disk without this feature. Can I return this item?
5,Good to see,"I am in the same age group as these guys, a few years older. If we have survived to this point we are worn around the edges. They are not what they were, but the passion is still there!"
4,HD Tracks 24/48 PCM Audio is Superior To Blu-Ray 24/48 DTS HD MA,"Comparing the HD Tracks 48/24 PCM to the BR 48/24 DTS HD MA on the same player (Oppo BDP-95).Oddly the HD tracks is much louder, but it's also MUCH more musical. I would recommend the hd tracks edition for those who's primary concern is the 2.0 audio."
3,Finally someone mentions the quality of the sound,"Aggreed, who puts out a Blu - Ray in DTS-HD 2.0? As for the old 3 part harmomies that sent goose bumps up my spine? I hate to say it their swan song is 4 - 5+ years too late. But I do have to say I was impressed that the concert was recorded 4/22/12 and it just hit the street! As for Stills, he has lost a ton of weight but I would have liked to have seen him play a lot more of his vast array of Martin's. I grew up on these guys and they will always be a part of who I am. At the end of the show it looked like they had fun and somewhat suprised that they pulled it off... just not quite..."
3,DVD,why don't you have this on DVD?? I was just wondering why this is not on Amazon on DVD.... I buy 90% of my dvds from Amazon....
3,Pleasant and Enjoyable,"Well, it's Crosby, Stills, & Nash. It's tempting to give this an extra star just for keeping on, keeping on. However, there's nothing here that sounds nearly as good, or as fresh, as these guys in their prime. The new songs are nice, but mostly forgetable. Crosby's and Nash's voices still sound good, but have definitely aged, while Stills' voice is personable, but muted. The backing band is every bit as professional as might be expected. Stills' finds some room for very expressive guitar work, but certainly not as often as for his solo performances. I prefer this to the choppy, but likeable, Deja Vu Live, but certainly not to any of their live performances from the 70s & 80s, or to Stills' Live at Shepherd's Bush. But CSN fans should find plenty to enjoy here. Great to have CDs and DVD together. (This review is not for Blu-Ray, which I think is great technology, but excessively expensive for digital video.)"
1,Remember the good old days.....,"I am 62 yrs old and have grown older loving CSN, I was a hippie in the late 60's early 70's and their music was just the best , they harmonized like no one I'd ever listened to next to James Taylor and Carol King......This CD was just horrible, it made me sad, growing older is difficult when you still hold on to things in the past that make you feel young...listening to this CD made me realize that we all grow old, I will continue to listen to all of their old music as I have them all but I passed up a chance to go to their concert here in Orlando , FL on May 5th after listening to this CD. :-("
2,Are they kidding?,"Who puts out a BluRay and records the audio in stereo these days?! Man, their 1982 release was even Dolby Digital surround! Baffling."
1,A waste of money,This is a complete disappointment. The singing is terrible. I am a long time fan and I am surprised that they would release such a product. The harmonies are completely off right from the start with Carry On. Do not waste your money on this disc.
4,Legends of Rock and Roll- Great set Lists- Well Played -Fun,"A band that defined a generation. The only reason I did not give this five stars is the lack of blu ray sound processing. One of the best harmonizing trios ever and NO DTS High Definition Master recording is a disappointment. Still, it is well recorded just compressed. Yes, everybody is older, and voices are tad strained, but this is music that is about real life. These guys are the real deal. And they can still play very well. Excellent"
5,The best of the best,These guys are the roots to music with meaning. Iam so glad to see them on stage live again. They did a good job im sure they rehearsed very hard to look and sound so good. Anyone who buyes this dvd will be glad they did. Great job CSN.
1,Stereo on Blu-Ray - What a Disgrace,The title of the concert is CSN 2012. Who releases a blu-ray music concert in 2012 in stereo only. It's a live concert. That's what 5.1 surround sound is meant to reproduce for us in our lounge room. Why rip us off with a stereo mix only? I've seen CSN live in Melbourne twice recently and loved the concerts. What a disappointment to find that the whole concert ambience and surround sound has been lost because some cheap-scate sound engineer wanted to save a few bucks and save a few hours to get to the bar sooner. I notice that there is no marking on the blu-ray packaging or the Amazon website that tells buyers that the sound is 2.0 and not 5.1. I smell a cover-up. Can I get my money back?
1,Disappointed,"I can understand their voices not being what they were 40 years ago, but to not take care to record them properly is well, ludicrous... or to be blunt, a major f*** up.Their voices sound thin and tinny. Amazing that these guys still don't know how to work a mike after 40 years, and the producer was obviously asleep at the wheel. Ok, so let's tweek the center channel to smooth them out and bring them up front a bit more. Never happen. This bluray is only a 2 channel mix, so there are NO controls for center channel balance.For the fans only....I have better recorded versions of everything on here that I prefer to remember them by."
4,CSN fan,Great Video - love seeing them together and happy. Bought several as gifts for other CSN fans we know. Enjoyed the song selection and great backup band. Also - glad to hear that they are writing new songs.
5,CSN & Y sometimes.,"This is a great set of almost all the classics, but much, if not most is a rehash of the earlier 4 disc set in a larger sized box."
3,Too much Nasal Nash,"I saw a clip of this DVD/CD package. Being a long time CSN and Stills fan, I bought it. Stills still has his chops on his guitar. Yes I agree with many that his voice isn't what it once was. Time, and bad choices have taken their toll on his voice.Graham Nash tries to do his best with vocals but I find his voice too over the top. It's too nasally and whiney to me.But this is why you have 4 other people there to help with vocals. The Band was tight for sure.I see that Crosby had to have his son along for the ride. James Raymond is a fine musician in his own right of course. But he needs to step into his own limelight.In closing I know that this whole affair /DVD are produced by Nash and that is why his vocals overtake every ones.Nash knows that had it not been for Crosby and Nash, he would have been still been singing Carrie Ann at some oldies showPeace"
3,The good and the not-so good,"The good:(1) David and Graham's lead vocals sound strong and clear.(2) Stephen's guitar playing is TOP NOTCH. The man's lead guitar burns away and he plays with a fire and conviction of a master.(3) Kick-butt backing band. Great drumming and a tight ensemble sound(4) Good value for the dollar. Two CDs and one DVD for less than $20.00.The not-so good:(1) Stephen's voice is shot. As a huge Stills fan, this is a painful reality for me to accept. His harmonies waver a lot too.(2) Because Stills' harmonies aren't spot-on, Crosby and Nash's vocalizing suffers too whenever Stills is part of the mix. Having seen C&N; as a duo, they sound much better without Stills.(3) The new songs, ""Radio"" and ""Almost Gone"" are nothing special and tend to meander. Their cover of ""Girl From The North Country"" is so-so, as well. It helps explain perhaps why the covers album project was shelved."
2,Don't Let this be anyone's first exposure to CSN,"I love these guys, one of my favourite groups of all time, but this cd is for hardcore fans only. Please don't let this be the first time your kids or grandkids hear these guys. I saw them in concert two years ago, and they were great, but my wife and I both commented on how weak their voices and harmonies were getting. Seeing them live and being wrapped up in the concert atmosphere it was fun, but listening to this cd would be painful for anyone who doesn't love them.At first I rated this cd OK, but I had to change it to two stars because I would not want to mislead anyone into purchasing it. There are great albums out there. CSN and DejaVu are classics. If you want live ""Four Way Street"".The redeeming value for me is hear Suite Judy Blue Eyes, when we saw them in concert we couldn't believe it when they didn't do it.CSN and CSN&Y; will be part of my music collection forever, I just probably won't play this one when anyone else is around."
1,Disc was defective,"I did not get a chance to see or listen to the contents of this disc. It loaded in my player and would go to the main menu , but would not play. I did notice on the main menu it had no choice of audio output, my system will automatically determine what format to play it in and it was 5 channel stereo. I would have thought this Blu ray would have been DTS or 5.1 surround. Cant comment on sound quality because it wouldn't play."
5,Blue Ray-CSN Concert,"A Great sonic and visual delight. With golden ear speakers and a cambridge AVR, the sound is better than I heard at theirWestbury concert."
4,Great Buy,"Great quality product, shipping was spot on. And alot cheaper than buying it retail at the store. Just wish they had included better instructions, my plumber took a little longer than usual for lack of directions. I thought he was exaggerating, but no I tried to read through them, even in German and it was a little loose ended. Finally got installed and works flawless"
4,Excellent Compilation!,"I bought this for my folks, but I must admit that we all really enjoyed this CD set. Good relaxing music. Also nice to have in the background."
4,Great value,"This same Invicta watch was ""on sale"" at TJ Maxx for $119, so I saved about $25 ordering from Amazon (more when you add in tax and free shipping). The watch is as striking in person as it is in the on-line pics. Invicta used ""hidden""/recessed buttons on the side wall of the watch to control the day/date/month dials...very ingenious and convenient. Watch face is more of a standard size, and not the oversized versions that seem to be more prevalent these days, so it will look good on a smaller wrist as well. Only drawback is that the hour/minute hands are almost the same color as the rear face, which at certain angles makes it difficult to see the time. A minor wrist angle change compensates nicely. I'd certainly by it again if I had a choice."
1,"All looks, no substance","This was a beautiful watch, but it didn't work. The first watch we received could not be set, so we sent it back. The replacement watch broke shortly after receipt, so we sent that one back too, for a refund this time!"
1,this book = NO GOOD,"this book's strongest attribute is that it is thick and has a bunch of practice tests in it...However, every other aspect of it is sadly insufficient as a study aid. Half of the explanations offered are simply combining the question phrase and the correct choice into one sentence, and that's the whole crappy explanation!! in addition there are a remarkable # of typos and questions that do not make sense or are incredibly ambiguous...avoid this book if you want to score above 100 on the test. NO GOOD"
1,don't do it!,"i agree with what has been said. this book is beyond horrid. on the first of the practice exams i got a 610. on the second i got a 430, despite having read the entire genetics section of my biology textbook in between. simply put, the two exams were in no way comparable in difficulty, and gave me no clue what to expect when i take the _real_ test. the explanations, as have been noted, are pathetic. many of the ecology questions (the subject I know most about) were just plain wrong. they said epiphytes are commnesalistic. wrong, or at least highly debatable (since they can add tons of weight to branches they're on, causing the branches to crash that makes them parasitic.) along the same vein, they said that lichens were mutualistic. lichenologists have been debating the nature of the symbiosis for 100+ years and still don't have an answer. the book also refered to the 10% rule of energy transfer between trophic levels, which is completely bogus. for the love of god, don't buy this book!"
4,Very Well Made- Attractive,"This door is very well, made, attractive and easy to use. The color blends well into the wood stain on the door and it becomes more or less not noticeable once installed. The flap moves easily and my cats have no problems (or fears) in going through- just make sure you prop the flap open for a few days to let your cats get used to going through.The only negative is that it is designed for a thinner door. If you have hollow core doors (As I do in my apartment)the sleeve part leaves a visible gap where the door is hollow. Not difficult to deal with, just an extra step.In any event, for the price, this is an extremely nice door comparable to those that sell for two or three times the price in pet stores."
2,Cat Door,"Not sure how to review this. The item was nice-looking and I liked that it was dark in color and wouldn't stand out like the white ones do. I also like the smoked flap. However, the flap hinge immediatley broke and item had to be returned. Nice appearance, may have gotten a flawed door, but it was not durable."
5,just what we needed,"I bought two of these - one for the bedroom door and one for the basement door. It took some coaxing, but the cat got used to the doors (we had to entice him with treats). It's so nice having these and NOT having to get up to let the cat into the bedroom, or keep the basement door open so he can get to his litter box. I didn't install them, but I'd guess it took an hour or so (and not too much complaining either! ;) ). Also, the brown cat door blends so well with our doors; they are not an eye sore. These are definitely worth getting!"
3,Wrong sizing information!,"The advertized product dimensions on the website are 7.8 x 1 x 9.2 inches. The actual dimensions are: Overall Size 7 5/8""x 7 7/8""; Cut out Size 6 ""x 6 7/8"". My cat is 12 lbs and still growing. He won't be able to squeeze into the hole that small. Have to return it."
3,cheap materials but good for the price.,"This cat door uses cheap materials and it doesn't hold up very well, but I gave it three stars because for 11 bucks you should expect that. It does work but don't expect it to last very long."
3,Good but could be better,"Their leg strap has a hard time staying up on my hamstring... I tried both shorts and track pants and no luck. Decided to use a bobby pin for the extra support. Game play could be better... Several of the exercises would not register my movement and this was a pain... When it did work, it was fun..."
2,Not sure I like this one,"Tried it for the first time today, selecting the 30-minute easy workout that said it was concentrating on upper body. Great, but why so many lunges of all kinds. That is all lower-body and way more of it than the upper body (which was bent over rows and shoulder presses and that's it). And you can't advance in the lunges if your form isn't right in sync with the model, but that's difficult. Sometimes I would hold and it would stop me and say I was standing. Or I was standing after a lunge and it wanted me to lunge again to get it right. So for each set of 12 lunges, I was doing more like 15 or 16. I finally gave up on the workout after the 5th set of lunges. I mean really, that's NOT upper body!"
2,Leaves me hungry,"A meal masquerading as a book, overstuffed with gratuitous details in order to pad what ought to be a magazine article about dining in a three-star Franch restaurant and observing the action behind the scenes."
2,"Worth skipping through, if not skipping","I am trying to make it to the end - too much filler in what I expected to be a much more informative book. Reading about Mr. Todhunter's personal experiences outside the restaurant are probably enjoyable if you are a member of his family, but that's as far as it goes."
1,Is Food a Showbusiness?,"We all eat with our eyes . So the make-up is part of what you pay for,if you have a professional like Taillevent.A highly overrated show-off restaurant , where the Americans are carefully segregated. because they are ""too loud"" Mr.Vrinat ,the owner, is as arrogant as he believes to be entitled to. If you want to have a real meal in Paris go to the ""Ami Louis"" where President Chirac took President Clinton. It is not cheaper, but infinitely better"
3,A Single Meal,"Here's an interesting idea for a book: Go to an exclusive French restaurant, indulge in a long and pricey meal, and then write about it. That's it. That's this book. It is a course by course description of a single meal. Todhunter tells about the food and the service and the restaurant and the chefs and wanders around here and there into all sorts of fascinating tangentially related topics. A fun quick read."
3,a meal observed,"Can't put the book down. Very interesting book about a dinning experience in France at one of the 3 star establishments. The only critisism is that the author tends too sway from the subject at hand. Overall I would recommend this book to one interested in knowing about the French proffesional kitchen and some of the personalities that make up the ""brigade"". This book has led me to others of similiar subject matter. I just skim the many pages of diversion to continue with the main account."
1,Not as good as they want you to think,"For general information it's ok. The information is ill-organized and when working through the problems at the back of each chapter, many of the answers are not actually provided in the book -- you are expected to research further in referened material in the chapter. When an instructor has to give the answers to problems that are in the back of the chapter because the chapter does not actually have enough information to solve the problem, there is a problem with the book.Also, the writers may know a great deal about networking, but they do not know much about passing that information on to others."
3,Computer Networking : A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet (3rd Edition),"with a textbook, I bought it. not good, but not bad"
2,Filled with a lot of useless information,"I used this book for a networks class in college. It does cover all the material that we went over in class. Although this book does contain a lot of useful information, it is also stuffed full of some complete nonsense. There's a lot of stupid stupid examples when they try to describe something technical with real world situtations. Sometimes the examples don't even relate well but are just in there because the authors felt they had to force an example into the book. Because we had to read the book for class I spent a bunch of hours reading through 500 pages of text with only 200 pages of real information. The main problem with this book is that it's really a 200 page book expanded out to 700-800 pages and I really can't appreciate that cause I have to read so much more."
2,Overly wordy,"Oh my gosh this book is sooooo wordy. It's 800 pages long, yet it probably could be condensed to less than 600, all without the loss of clarity. The authors explain everything to an excruciating degree, and often times things are repeated over and over again. For example, on page 194, a sentence reads:""Web servers typically spawn a new process or create a new thread for each new client connection"".And then, only two sentences later, the authors write:""Web servers often use only one process, but create a new thread with a new connection socket for each new client connection""I'm not saying that this book should be written so as to be as precise as good code, but oh my gosh, spare us the overbearing details. Just give us the facts, please, and dispense with the jargon!"
5,Great Book,"I like the book very much. It is very up-to-date on emerging technologies and very explanatory. However, I was expecting to see solutions to exercises. A great book indeed."
5,Amazing! Olivier thee greatest actor ever!,This movie is perfect! Laurence Olivier is the only actor who has mastered Shakespeare to perfection! He truly is Richard III in this awesome movie. The only thing I am disappointed with is why this great movie is not on DVD yet! Hey people at the DVD company get off your bottoms and make this a DVD!!! And don't make it a sloppy one either! Make it as good as the movie!
3,One dimensional Richard,"I know I'm going to come off as a bit of a heretic here. I already know that people generally LOVE Larry's,well, anything Shakespeare,BUT, as a Shakespearean actor myself,(and one whose favorite role is the Hunchback King),I must say that Richard's character has much more potential than Olivier's rendition reveals. Also,the play is abridged by about 30 min. of cut material,(in order to cement Richard's one-dimensional cast). I didn't particularly like Olivier's Shylock either. To be fair,his Hamlet is brilliant,but unfortunately,it too is abridged,like, where are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern anyway? Apparently this is done for the shorter attention span of the American audience?"
4,a fine release of a great film.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Lawrence Olivier directed and stars in this great movie. As this is a Shakespeare release, I see no need to write a synopses. The acting is incredible and the photography is great also.The Criterion Collection has done a fine job releasing this in a double disc set. It includes footage that was recently rediscovered and not seen for many years prior to the release.The special features are:""Great Acting: Laurence Olivier"" A 1966 interview with Lawrence Olivier conducted for the BBC, a 12 minute featurette/trailer for the film as well as a theatrical trailer. There are also production and publicity photos and lobby cards. The film also has an optional audio commentary track by Russell Lees and John Wilders.This is a must for Shakespeare fans."
2,a little disappointing,"This movie had good stage sets and Laurence Olivier made a rather good performance. I know that this movie was supposed to follow Shakespeare's play but this subject could have been a lot more interesting if made into a drama (which would of course require some historical license taking). Maybe its just me but I find Shakespeare a little boring.However, the end of the movie depicting the battle of Bosworth was tacky as hell! It looked as if it were filmed on the African savannah. It was clearly not merry old England."
1,GARBAGE!,"What pathetic nonsense. So, a deformed ugly hunchback murders a man because he wants his wife. Then, the deformed hunchback tells her he murdered her husband because he wants her love. She feigns anger and then within seconds starts kissing the murderer and decides to wear the ring the murderer gives. This is a pathetic movie."
5,Una de las mejores películas de la Historia del Cine.,"Obra maestra del cine mundial, la interpretación de Laurence Olivier alcanza en esta película cotas magistrales. Cada vez que es visionada se descubre un matiz, una nueva y cruel ironía de las que son comunes en esta gran visión del poder y la ambicíón sin escrúpulos. Un complejo entramado de las pasiones humanas. El eterno pulso entre el bien y el mal."
5,The classic Richard III,It goes without saying that this classic production is well-worth purchasing--it is one of the great dramatisations of Shakespeare. Highly recommended.
5,"A horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse!","Laurence Olivier at the top of his form with this sublime performance about Richard III the wicked deform king and his conquests . This is the definitive and greatest adaptation of this magnificent work of William Shakespeare . If you liked the acting of Olivier in Hamlet , this is much more compelling , beside the fact that Olivier did not win the Academy Award with this movie .A superb triumph . Watch for the cast : Ralph Richardson , John Gielguld , Claire Bloom ."
5,Great guide!,"I don't write reviews too often, but I found this book so helpful and clear that I felt you should know. It's also a great value!The first chapter runs you through a complete Director movie example, so you feel oriented and see the forest from the trees before delving in deeper (I wish all computer books did that). The rest of the book exapnds on all of the major Director components, following a very logical flow so you really feel you're making progress. This book is generally much clearer and easier to follow than the Director documentation."
2,Too Simplistic,"This book was required in my Multimedia class. I find the Dir. 8 Bible too extensive, but this is too simplistic.The first 5 chapters repeat the basics I've already learned in school. Chapters 6-10 are of little use because they're about graphics, and I do graphics with graphics software. The chapters that could have been expanded like adding video, lingo, etc. are cut too short.Using this book, I was able to make very simple Director 8 projects. I want a simple book that shows me how to get the most out of Director 8, like rollovers, uniquely shaped video playback windows, etc. Y'know, the stuff that makes people go, ""WOW!"" and pay big bucks! This one doesn't do that."
3,Solid Indian Trip Hop,"All the tracks are Indian flavored so while it's Asia, it's a pretty narrow focus.It's not really 'loungey' in the correct dance sense, it's more trip hop - at best, you might call these tracks mid-tempo chill but a more accurate description is trip hop.Unlike some other discs masquerading New Age as Trip Hop, these are all fine tracks with solid musicianship and are real trip hop tracks.Other than KOYAL which is a flat out spooky track (and the only actual chill/lounge dance track) - the others all blend into each other - nothing really wrong with consistency but nothing else really outstanding."
5,Mesmerizing,"I have bought many Putamayo CD's and this one is by far the best one. It is full of great songs with deep and clear instrumentation. Even if you do not understnad the words as some songs are in Hindi, Uzbek and others; it is still very nice to listen to. All my friends like it and is good for background music at a party and for easy listening when relaxing. A must have for any world music collection."
2,Ageing hippies find Asian instruments at garage sale,"Sounds as if some old hippies are doing re-hashed old blues licks on Asian instruments they found at a garage sale (Sitar etc.) and passing it off as ""Eastern"". Very sophomoric instrumental work with some slicked-up production to pass it off as exotic. Dissappointing that with the whole eastern world of talent to choose from, these extremely boring selections were made. Two cuts by Prem Joshoua are the only saving grace but they can't rescue this cheese-puff fast-food version of authentic Asian talent.Trip-hop indeed! I will take the trip back to my local Library to return this. . no loss. Save your Rupees and research real musical talent, of which there is no lack in ""Asia""."
3,Good collection of Asian sounds,"As an introduction to various artists of this genre it does it's job pretty well. Plus I found it a good addition to my collection.The tracks selected have depth and interest which stands up to repeated listening.With the inclusion of such masterful artists such as Prem Joshua this can not help being pretty good.If you are buying this album, do not bother with getting Asian Groove as it is not up to the standard of this album."
2,Putumayo Presents: Asian Lounge,"I bought this CD from Tower Records shortly before they went out of business for next to nothing. The only good track on this CD was the first one. After that, the music just seemed old and monotonous to me."
5,My favorite in this collection,This Cortney doll is gorgeous!Black hair and(???green???) eyes?Well I love there outfits in this series!It sorta reminds me of Musa from the winx club.But with a different outfit style.I like the red and purple and I like the jeans and the pink shoes and her shug is so cool.Her purse is so retro.
3,beautifull but the head is big,Hey Maulino doll aficionado i totattly agree with you this new dolls have this ugly big head i wish they had the normal head size if the head was smaller she would had been better
3,pretty but with big head,"like most playline barbies being made now, this doll would have been really pretty if not for the big head size! in some fashion fever dolls, the head size aren't that quite noticeable but with newer dolls coming out, the head size issue seems to be getting worse. i especially like the face paint on the barbie doll for this series but didn't buy it for the big head."
3,Good book for the basics,"This book is a good starting point for basic recipes. There are good instructions on basic things, but I tend to adjust many of the recipes I use to suit my own taste and cooking style. A couple of the recipes were really good. This is one of those cookbooks you go to when you want the ordinary. That being said, my husband often wants ""the ordinary"" so I do use it a lot for inspiration."
2,"It does not match my car, 2005 Galant","When i received this, I think I got a good deal. Unfortunately, it gave me a great surprice. It doesn't fit my car and I can not put it into the air filter housing."
5,Billy and Emma is Uplifting and Fun,"Billy and Emma is one of my son's favorite books. Even if you are not fond of parrots, if you like beautiful illustrations, adventure, and enjoy a happy ending, you will like Billy and Emma. Billy and Emma, two macaws who are best friends, enjoyed a happy life at the zoo until Emma was kidnaped by a robber. Despondent and desperate, Billy turns to his friend Nancy the crow for help. With the aid of Harold the owl and some friendly pidgeons, Billy and Nancy perform a daring rescue. While telling a very entertaining story, Billy and Emma teaches about the importance of friendship, teamwork, and good triumphing over evil."
1,This Lock is GARBAGE!,This Locking System is GARBAGE.I have 20 of these for a set of 20 laptops that we use as a training lab.1) These locks are difficult to operate as all parts of the lock turn.2) The mechanism is difficult to work and prone to problems because of the way the flip-switch on the back of the lock sits.3) We have had 3 of these locks freeze up. NO combination will open them. 4) 2 times I have had to use a hack saw to remove them from the laptop.I recommend that you DO NOT BUY this lock!!!
1,DO NOT BUY!,"DO NOT BUY!It will freeze, and not open on the code you set it to. Then...if you just wiggle around the keys making random combos...it will open.This is not security, this is randomness..."
3,Only three digits,"Only three digits on it so it prevents people from picking up laptop and walking away, but easy to crack if you sit down for 5 minutes and try. Convenient, however, in that there isn't a key to carry around."
1,The darn thing locked me out the first time,"This product needs serious help. What use is it if the first time you try it your computer is locked and won't open no matter what you do? Don't buy this product. It's too unreliable. Fortunately, the thing was locked to my desk, and not to a library table. Hopefully, I can spend twice what I paid for it to get the damn thing back to where I started."
1,its a bit too secure,"for powerbook g4 users like myself, it is a horrible choice.1) the lock is ment to be put on the right hand side, Powerbooks lock slots are located on the left hand side of the laptop2) the combination is a hassle to turn-even if have the skinniest fingers3) the directions a bit confussing, esp if you are trying to set up your own combination4) 4ft cord is a bit short5) its too expensive- its not worth my 29.99 at retailers6)its very difficult to open -making it a bit too secure7) if you cannot open it, it has to be taken to a locksmitha waste of money"
3,"Portable, but a little difficult to set up","WHen I got this i set the lock and attached it to my laptop, when i tried to remove it it would not unlock. After an hour or so i figured out what combination the lock had act registered, but after figuring that out I have no trouble at all. So if you get this be careful in setting the combo. Otherwise a god product, that is very portable."
2,not woth it,"This lock is not as user friendly as it seams. Worst part is the numeric lock , it is not at all smooth , if the numbers are slightly here and there it will not at all open. Means its even hard to open for a person knowing the number ( password ) , GR8 !!!!!!!!!!!!!. To much securei will rather recommed one with manual key rather than number lock"
5,My son is very happy with this game,"My son likes the game very much, I am glad I purchased it from Amazon, never was disappointed with the quality and service provided."
2,UK Dance/Pop single with a variety of average remixes,"Like all Motiv 8 releases this has a rather commercial feel to it but is sadly inferior to its predecessors, the excellent 'Rockin For Myself' and 'Break the Chain', as was demonstrated by its fairly poor chart showing (in the UK) back in 1995. Clearly the tie-in with the Bond film (which the single was atually released before) did not have the desired effect on sales. By far the best track of the lot is the Motiv8 Spectral Dub which is much more in keeping with the usual up-tempo Motiv 8 club sound than the extremely lethargic Money Penny Mix. The other mixes, notably the Sharp Dub, are not what producer Steve Rodway is best at, being a more non-commercial, underground sound - and so fall rather flat. Basically this is a disc for fans only. If you are exepcting something of the quality of Rockin For Myself, the remix of Mary Kiani's 'When I Call Your Name', or even the Spice Girl's Wannabe remix, you'll be rather disappointed."
5,"One of the years most captivating cd's, well worth the price","I believe the HavocBrothers to be one of the greatest bands I've listened to all year. Their sound is fresh, raw and original and I recommend it to anyone looking to get moved through an intelligent social & political expression. Beware, very vulgar and offensive lyrics. A+"
5,i really liked this :),"really ""ahead of it's time""---- i was amazed by the lyrical theme.... super spirtual/political, yet hard edged. wonder if these guys snort crack, it sure sounds out there (lol)----but in a good way. >>> my best to the band"
5,intense!,"a great sound, love the singing and catchy melodies, especially the way these songs talk about real issues. only complaint is that it might be a little ""offensive"" for some, definitely not something you want your young children to hear (lots of profanity), otherwise extremely captivating & emotional."
3,I don't get it...,"I've sewed for almost 40 years. It is obvious that a lot of work and thought went into this book. But I can't use it, and I returned it. I was under the impression that it would have more samples or ideas for making chasubles, and it does have some. Other reviewers are right - the cost of these things can be outrageous. This resource is excellent for someone who is interested in making every kind of vestment there is - and google vestment if you don't know what you're getting into. If you are primarily interested in chasubles, this will be a disappointment. I guess I paid too much attention to the cover. Which is very nice."
1,Another disappointment,"The beautiful cover is misleading. The cover ends the color pictures. There are descriptions of the different kinds of liturgical vestments, but the patterns are limited. I am sorry I spent the money and am still looking for a good book with descriptions of liturgical symbolism and patterns for stoles."
5,Perfect,"This was exactly what I needed to make some vestments for our parish priest and deacon. It has patterns, that are simple enough to follow. Works for me."
3,"Not bad, not the best","I'm a long-time graphic novel fan, appreciate the work that goes into the drawing of a story and, certainly, Jim Starlin's black and white renderings are nicely drawn and detailed (although I found the overall darkness rather tedious). It's in the story telling itself that I have problems. I have all three books in the series and they're all the same- the story is very choppy in it's continuity. I don't mind characters being introduced suddenly and then explained in flashback format, that's cool; but there are leaps in plot development that make the action seem very stilted and I never get the feeling that any of the characters have any depth to them. The angst of the protagonists remains superficial and the supporting characters never seem to do anything more than fill in plot movement. That said, the books are still enjoyable for the art work and I look forward to seeing what Mr. Starlin comes up with in the future."
2,"An ambitious, but weak, effort.....","I'm a big fan of Jim Starlin, and I have fond memories of reading the Dreadstar series when I was a young teen. So it was with great anticipation that I read (for the first time) Dreadstar Volume One: The Metamorphosis Odyssey.Boy was I let down....This is a preachy mess that has NOTHING to do with the series that followed it. We follow a group of characters that are nothing more than empty shells, as they fight a race of bad guys that are never given any substance either.Vanth Dreadstar himself is an obnoxious creep, so there is NO ONE to feel for in this book.....all you can do is be dragged along for a quest that takes Millions of years to complete, and then is rendered completely moot at the end. The saving grace is that the last few pages manage to tie this mess up, and set up the better stories that followed."
3,I wish to VOICE my opinion,"Wynton Marsalis is a wonderful talent. This is another thing I bot from Amazon without paying sufficient attention. I don't care for the vocals on here. Not that they are bad, I just don't want them hear. You here? The music is marvelous. I think that this is a great album. I have another one of his CDs that I got here and I must remember to give that one 5 stares. (I have already given it more that 5 listens.) Ain't nobocy singin' on that 'un. If you like Baroque music, and trumpet, then spend your money on this guy!"
2,A disappointment,This reproduction of the original tape of Wynton Marsalis is of poor quality. It doesn't sound any better than the worn-out tapes I threw away. It has the same annoying screechy sound on the high notes.
2,Not as it says,"The description/title given by Amazon is ""The AB Guide to Music Theory"" but tells you nothing that it is a part 2 book. A little frustrated when I was looking for something different and this came. If ordering, be aware that it is part 2."
2,unfortunate,unfortunate that this solid docu on an american artist and visionary devolved into socialist propaganda at the end. i know it earns the director some kudos from his industry comrades but it taints the film and milton's legacy. sad.
1,A Major Disappointment,"I was very disappointed by this book. Many of my knitting friends proclaim this as the 'best of the top-down knitting books'...I don't find that to be the case. There are NO pictures to 'show' what she is talking about and the descriptions and directions are wordy, confusing and difficult to follow. I am an advanced intermediate knitter and have been knitting off-and-on since I was 9 and knitting constantly for the past 2 years...so I am certainly not a beginner...but this book is going in my Garagle Sale next month...I will never use it."
5,an essential knitting book,"Whether you are a knit designer, or a casual knitter, this book is a must-have. First of all, the top-down method (style? method seems like the right word) is very easy to understand, easy to execute, and because you can try your garment on along the way, you don't need to worry about fit. And no seaming!! This book is laid out very cleary, written in plain english, and there are a ton of variations. If you've only knit from patterns, this book will make you want to design your own!"
5,Wish I had known about this sooner!!,"I am 66 and have been knitting since the age of 4. I never followed patterns except as a source of inspiration. I buy yarns I like without knowing what I will knit. I often recycle yarns but it's always a guess as to what I can knit with what's available. Now I can do the top and sleeves; then the length, possible pockets, collars, hoods and finishes are determined by how much is left. Wonderful!!"
4,Knitting from the top,"I love this book... love the pictures and the directions are well done.My only problem is that the patterns in the book are so out of date... from the 80's and I'm not a good enough knitter to alter them myself.Other than that, it is a great way to learn circular knitting.TEMAAlso, congratulations to Amazon for the quick delivery... you rock!"
3,Knitting from the Top,I ordered a hard copy and received a soft cover older edition. The information is there but it was not as indicated at the time of purchase. Was disappointed.
5,Foundation Knitting Design Book!,"This book is essential for anyone learning to design and experiment in knitting - especially for those of us who sigh wearily when we see a pattern divided up into small pieces that have to be sewn up at the end. You'll find you read sections, go away and try, and come back for more. A truly valuable book."
2,Knitting from the Top,"If you are a beginner knitter, this book is not for you. No pictures and lots of words. When I understand the concept better, I think this book will be an excellent book for me. For now it is not"
2,I think this is a hard book to understand for a beginner.,"I am not a beginner, but this book is too much like college course study material. I am trying to get into the real meat of the book, but it is a struggle. A beginner would be totally over whelmed and might even stop knitting forever if this is their first knitting book purchase. Not wanting to be outdone, this is my challenge for a long winter in New England. Hope for Spring!Mari"
2,Not as Advertised,"This book may be great for a long time pro but it's not for the intermediate knitter. No photos, complicated instructions that are not easy or even possible for most knitters to follow."
3,knitting from the top,It wasn't what I expected. I would have liked some practice projects and more graphics.
2,Please enter a title for your review,"From the opening stop-start riffing on a single muted powerchord on Failure Was Destined To Destroy it's apparent that this is another redundant metalcore band that aren't capable of doing anything beyond competently demonstrating the conventions of the genre. They're pretty heavy, the production is decent, and the vocals are slightly death metally in a not entirely generic way, but this band is still utterly unimpressive. After they're done with the one-powerchord riff they move on to some standard listless melodic death riffing, and then some bland strumming of fuller chords with some gang vocals that seem to be used as some pathetically clueless grab for hardcore credibility. It loops monotonously from there, until they reach the obligatory breakdown, and useless extended outro, dragging the song out for another minute and a half after it had already run it's course."
5,Not just for armor modelers: railroad modelers find much to use!,"I am a former armor and military aircraft modeler and so I know to go to forums and resources that most railroad modelers don't begin to think of exploring.I found MIG's book a treasure trove of techniques for my railroad modeling. Granted, I will have to use his technique descriptions as inspiration rather than recipes. Most freight cars in the era I model were an oxide red and most steam locomotives were black, so the use of base olive drab and panzer gray...and the colors used to filter, fade, rust and enhance them would be different too.But I have never seen a railroad modeling magazine article or how-to book describe filters or mapping. And yet the possibilities for these techniques in railroad model weathering are huge.This book may get me back into armor modeling too, but for now, it is a treasured resource for my railroad modeling!"
5,MUSICAL TERROR,"This is the one of the more frightening albums ive ever heard in my life,this is also becoming one of my all time fav albums,it seems like every time you listen to it it brings some thing new,strangers die every day and mark says all right just can not be beat on head phones staring into a black light,i recemond this to any one with balls and also to death metal/gore grind/porn grind freaks who may not no that the surfers early albums are all great and were ahead of there time in there weirdness."
3,some worthy songs!,"I LOVE tracks 2 and 12 !!!!tracks 8 and 10 are okay...the rest of it I didn't likeI usually focus on particular songs I like, rather than the album as a whole... because, for me, it's easier to find new music by looking up reviewers that have similar taste in music, so my reviews are with that in mind."
4,it's Butthole Surfers alright...,"i would give it 3.5 stars, but i rounded up to be nice.those of you looking for ElectricLarryLand material, this is not it. This isn't the newer techno-y Weird Revolution crap either. it's not as trippy as Humpty Dumpty LSD, but it's sort of close.I'd recommend it to anyone who digs the butthole surfers. It's not real expensive, worth the buy."
4,Butthole dementia continues,"The Surfers' second album, which gets my vote for best album title ever, is a little less scary, but still wildly weird as their debut ""Psychic...Powerless...Another Man's Sac"". As an added bonus, when recently released on CD by Latino Bugger Veil, the songs from the Surfers' EP ""Cream Corn From The Socket Of Davis"" (released around the same time as the original record, in 1986) are included at the end.Song highlights: the pounding acid-drenched cover of ""American Woman"", the bizaare Daffy Duck-like whooping vocals in ""Waiting For Jimmy To Kick"", the watery sludgyness of ""Strangers Die Everyday"", ""Mark Says Alright"" which only vocals are a distorted freaky growling, and the hilarious ""Moving To Florida"", where Gibby gleefully sings away about potty-training the Chairman Mao and sausages dancing on the hood of Ray Bolger's car. Priceless stuff.A close call, but it edges out ""Sac"" for my favorite Surfers album. Buy it!"
1,Don't buy,"This product has 2 flaws. 1. It does not attach easily to a wire crate, even with the spring attachment hanger. 2. It is not drip resistant. It drips from the very first fill. I thought it had stopped, but when I got home at the end of the day, the entire bottle had leaked out into the cage."
1,Dripless? NOT,Not a good deal- dripless water bottle if no animal tries to use it...after that it keeps dripping until it's empty!
2,I'll stick with Toys R Us,"My 7 year old daughter wanted a camera. This looked like a great option online because it included scrapbook items and a cute case in girly colors. I e-mailed the seller and she was very responsive and convinced me it would work for our purpose.Once it arrived, I couldn't even bring myself to present this to my daughter on Christmas. The case was decorated in a cute, hippie kind of way and it did include little pens and a notebook for creativity. That was good. The camera, however, (which was our main reason for buying this) felt like a cardboard project that someone painted. We tried to use it to no avail. It just never worked.Overall, the concept was good. It was cute but, the camera was not worth the small amount we paid for the whole thing. If the manufacturer would add in a better camera, we'd buy it again."
2,Misleading product information,"The Amazon Editorial Review is incorrect and misleading. The included CD does not offer guidance on two of the sixteen arrangements. No instruction on either ""I Saw Her Standing There"" or ""Little Wing"" is given. Since I bought the book for tips on how to play I Saw Her Standing There, I am very disappointed."
1,Very dissapointed :(,"I bought both volume I and II together, big mistake! I am very dissapointed with this product, The notation is fine and is all in the book, but Mr Juber, truly a business man! does not include the complete tunes in the cd, instead he tells you which cd you can buy to listen to it. So, not only you have to spend $25 on this, now you have to cough up the money to buy his cds as well. What he does in the included cd is to play bits of the songs slowed down in tempo, a lot of talking of obvious things if you pay attention to the notation, makes wide measure leaps and you wind up totally confused since even after hearing this ""master class explanation"" you won't have an idea of what the piece is supposed to sound like. I should have just played out of the powertab arrangements out there of the songs that I like and can be found on youtube. If I could have returned this book I would have done so."
4,on the verge of madness,The clear progress of a man's mental illness. The man was a genius but this autobiography is a must for anyone studying schizophrenia.
1,What was the publisher thinking?,"This is precisely the kind of tome that deserves to gather dust on a library shelf. Even for a fan of dance and particularly dance during the Nijinsky era, it contains only two or three passages that are casually of interest and by no means earth shattering. This unexpurgated edition does little to shake up the image of the brilliant and disturbed artist who is ""god"" one minute and a ""pen"" the next. I'd be hard pressed to think of ANYONE I know, love and/or admire whose free associative ramblings and paranoid nonsense I would be willing to pay $20+ for and read 250+ pages of. A total waste of time. Curious readers should steer clear and consider Ostwald's probing psychohistory instead."
3,Puzzling and incomplete for me.,"I do not find this work leading me to an understanding of relativity, which was my goal. The author states that Paper 4 leads to demonstrating E=MC2, but it is not there to my eye. I have in the past seen a succinct derivation."
1,Incomplete History,"I recently read a much more informative book ""Albert Einstein: The Incorrigible Plagiarist"" by Christopher Jon Bjerknes which tells the truth about Einstein and the 1905 papers Einstein's wife Mileva Maric wrote for him. The Bjerknes book is a scholarly book, and it presents the facts. Anyone interested in the 1905 papers should know the truth. Max Born said of the 1905 relativity paper, ""It gives you the impression of quite a new venture. But that is, of course, as I have tried to explain, not true."" The truth is that the theory belongs to Boscovich, Lange, Voigt, Fitzgerald, Larmor, Lorentz, Palagyi, and Poincare, among many others. The 1905 paper on special relativity did not give a single reference to these men."
1,black and white photos,This looks like a lovely book of color photos but it is a very disappointing book of black and whites. I recommend that you choose one with color. This product is not as it seems.
4,"Good book, not a lot of pictures.","For some reason I thought there would be color pictures in this book but the only color picture is the one on the cover. I guess I should have known better with the price. The whole book is in black and white. For the price, this is a great book to learn more about Fallingwater - but don't expect any pretty color pictures."
3,complete but black and white pictures,This is an historical books about this house but all the pictures are in B & W. And it's so sad for such a masterpiece of frank Lloyd Wright.
3,NO COLOR!,"great info, but disappointing as all pictures are black and white.I read the description and it didn't mention the book was only in black and white, and i'm guessing now that is why they don't have the search inside this book option on. BUT, SHAME on me for not reading the reviews where many people have written about the lack of color pictures.I bought this book for my niece to compliment the LEGO Architecture Fallingwater. We thought it would be a great opportunity for our niece to learn.i"
4,Just what I wanted,"These shoes were for my 17 year old son. When he recieved them he stated ""This is just what I wanted."" He says the shoes are comfortable and in the color he likes."
3,"Another intro book on Win32 programming, GDI & DirectX","200 pages on basic Win32, 200 pages on basic GDI, 300 pages on DirectX and 30 pages appendix & index.C based SDK programming style, no real C++, use of global variables, no UniCode, worst indented sample code.No coverage on EMF, printing&spooling, transformation, alphablending, PlgBlt, MaskBlt. Little coverage on DIB.Bugs:1) pg 84, saying command line para works only in DOS command line, or run dialog box. What about CreateProcess?2) pg 85, saying HWND is 16-bit.3) pg 222, process WM_CLOSE in WM_COMMAND handling4) pg 380, extra for (j=0; j<4; j++) loop, slow code.Still, may be the best intro book to students on Win32, GDI and DirectX."
4,Great examples,This book is well written with many good examples. The included CD-Rom is a tremendous advantage!
2,Can't get tight & secure enough to be effective,"This brace has four thin velcro tabs that secure it around the wrist, but I can't get it tight enough around that my wrist doesn't move. The edge between my thumb and forefinger also rubs against my skin uncomfortably. A much better product is the Wellgate. The velcro straps are pulled back around through a loop for better support. I like it so much, I'm buying two! It costs twice as much though, but free shipping from Amazon."
4,Worked!,"GREAT! Just what I was looking for, Thank you. Would recomend to all who are in need of this item."
1,just terrible,"Building 429 has lost it completely. Stay away from this album and check out Jake Smith, Rush of Fools, Over Ashes, 33Miles. Those are great albums. This is just a band album and they're trying to hard."
1,I was a fan,"When Building 429 came out in 2004, I was such a fan. Space in Between us was a great album, then they released Rise and it has all gone down hill from there.This album is just a bad attempt to try and remake the glory define days. I am sad to say that I have been burnt twice now by these guys, and I will make sure their next album is worth buying."
3,Princess costume,"Gave to my granddaughter for her 4th birthday. She loves it. The hat, however, was next to impossible to keep on if she moves her head at all, and most little princesses rarely just sit still. I fashioned a tie which helped a little, but the hat should really be redone. We finally ended up just replacing the hat with a tiara."
5,Spider-Man 2 Score,This is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
3,Missing some music pieces,I decided to buy this CD after wanting a piece played in Spider-Man 2 SO badly. I was furious when I listened to this and didn't find it anywhere. The piece I was looking for was the piano piece during the scene when Peter hugs Aunt May when she's packing. You'd think it would be in 'Ant May Packs' but it's not. It is also missing some other great pieces from the movie. A bit of a let down...
4,Not as Good as the First But still Good!,"In this case, I think Danny Elfman found it difficult to come up with many new ideas for the film. A lot of this score is just a re-arrangement of the original Spiderman Score. However, there are still some new interesting & exciting cues and themes, and is well worth buying."
3,Where's The Rest of It?!,"I must echo another reviewer's comments by saying that although Danny ""Pee Wee"" Elfman did a fantastic job orchestrating this film, some of the best stuff is not included on this CD. Most notably missing is the music from the First Fusion Experiment, the beginning of The Train Fight, and after The Train Fight when Spidey passes out. Don't let the song titles fool you because half of them are misleading. And again, it's hard to understand why they only fill a potential 74/80-minute disc with 48 minutes of music. Sony really missed a golden opportunity to release a stellar and complete score that compliments the changing moods of this film masterfully."
3,"Good, despite distracting behind-the-scenes drama.","It's sad that Danny Elfman and director Sam Raimi are no longer working together. Supposedly, Raimi was a monster to work with on this film, resulting in the hiring of two other composers to work on the movie -- Christopher Young and John Debney. The music is nearly as good as the first film's, though there is a lot of familiar material that's simply reused from ""Spider-Man."" It's also pretty sad that the insert contains no thank-you list. Elfman must have been very bitter. And the fact that two original version of music are listed as ""bonus tracks"" (one of them -- the train scene -- was rescored by Young) is simply ridiculous. It was as if Elfman was making them sound more important than they are."
4,A Story About Blackmail and Attempted Murder,"Jockey Kelly Hughes and trainer Dexter Cranfield have their licenses suspended by the Oxford stewards for supposedly throwing a race. Hughes believes that they were framed and he sets out to clear their names and get the licenses restored.Who would want to ruin their careers? Could it be the envious and greedy jockey Charley west? Could it be rival trainer Jack Roxford or the imperious Lord Gowery?As the truth is revealed we hear a story of sexual deviation, blackmail, fixed evidence and attempted murder.ENQUIRY is up to the usual standard for a crime novel by Dick Francis.If you are a fan of the author, you will probably enjoy this book."
4,Interesting characters--worth 4.5 stars,"This is my 1st Dick Francis book--another author I selected from the ""Mystery Lovers' Book of Quotations."" I found it quite enjoyable--especially since the author provides sufficient information/clues to ""figure it out."" Which I did, but with some effort. The characters are varied & interesting--especially the dichotomies in social position & how the characters respond to these under varying circumstances. The central theme of horse racing was also different & interesting too. The ending is, however, rather sudden & unforeseen. I'm not sure how realistic it is--but it's possible. I look forward to reading more Francis' books."
3,10 game center,lovely produc. i felt that the delivery charge which exceded the cost of the item was too high
2,No Closed Caption,"I Started To Watch The Last Detective And It Looked Like IMight Enjoy This Series//However I Found It very Hard ToUnderstand What They Were Always Saying//Some Of The Actors Mumble When They Think That This Is Acting//It's bad Enough That I Have To Strain And Listen Hard To Try And Understand Them But Then The Music Background Which Is Not That Good To Begin With Is Much Too Loud//Why They Think That Loud Musicis More Important Than What The Actors Are Saying// It'sBeyond Reason Why This Company ACORN Media Does Not Add Closed Caption(SUBTITLES) To All DVDS That They Produce//Well Maybe In The Future They'll Wake Up// By The Way I Do have Very Good Hearing/Thank You For Listening,Stanley CooperJupiter,Florida"
1,Dissappointed without closed captions,I planned to purchase this series until I discovered that closed captions were not available. It's difficult enough to understand rapidly spoken American English and equally difficult to comprehend mumbled English spoken by British actors.
4,Likeable Character & Enjoyable Mysteries,"Dangerous, as he's called by everyone, is anything but. He's not given credit for all the successful sleuthing he does because he's kind of a softy and a little bumbling - he's just too nice. Reminds me a little of Detective Columbo, but a gentler version. The only problem I have is his almost-ex-wife's cavalier treatment of Dangerous - it makes me sorry for him, but I suppose that's part of the charm of the story."
5,Very good series,"I have trouble finding police television series that my law enforcement husband enjoys, but this is one. The character is so real that you can't help but be drawn to him. I love that they will actually show him sitting to tea with people he's interviewing. This series demonstrates that you don't need outrageous car chases and gun fights in every episode in order to produce a great show."
3,stiff,"There isn't much flexibility within the shoes, so if you have wide feet like I do, you might get blisters until you break them in. But the wedges makes for easier walking/running."
4,Very cute,"Another great shoe from naughty monkey. As stated in other reviews, a little wide but not too much to create problems. Not an all day shoe but very cute and attention grabber. Only problem is the shoe is fabric and can get dirty."
2,"didnt fit, too bad","Beautiful shoe but it didnt fit and had to be returned. The shoe toe box is narrow and the heel is wide. I thought it was my feet and gave it to my daughter, she said the same thing. Too bad, it's a beautiful shoe."
3,Ignore the first three chapters,"There is some really good material here. Unfortunately the first three chapters are incredibly fluffy and vague. They are also full of grammatical mistakes, non sequiturs, and spelling errors. The home page of one fairly pedestrian and old-fashioned site is shown in grayscale half-a-dozen times, wasting 15 column inches. The valuable ideas in the front could have been distilled into 8 pages instead of taking 70.-Start at Chapter 4. From here out the book is very good. It starts with developing for the audience, navigation principles, color and graphics, etc. and goes all the way to Java, VRML and interactive design. So don't give up. The book design and editing are poor, but the last two-thirds makes it worth the price."
5,Amazingly in-depth,"Although this book is short (also, contrary to the description, it is paperback), it gives the reader an unusual perspective on what Lenin was thinking less than a month before the Bolshevik Revolution. Reading such primary sources is not a common occurence."
4,An excellent anthology!,"SHADOWS AND SILENCE (Ash-Tree Press, 2000) represents an anthology of all-original stories that range in tone and content from the traditional ""Jamesian"" tale one might expect from Ash-Tree to pieces somewhat more avant garde; it includes stories by Ramsey Campbell, Steve Rasnic Tem, Clive E. Ward, Jessica Salmonson, and others. This is the second such anthology released by the small publishing house; the last one, MIDNIGHT NEVER COMES (1997), set the bar rather high, garnering 15 honorable mentions (from a total of 17 stories) in THE YEAR'S BEST FANTASY AND HORROR (edited by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling). However, if anything, this new anthology may actually be a bit better. There are only a few real clinkers among the 25 stories and, I think, some real gems. Standouts include Steve Duffy's ""The Rag-and-Bone Men,"" Ron Weighell's ""The Counsels of Night,"" and Frances Oliver's ""The Man in the Blue Mercedes."""
4,Back In Business,"I purchased this variety pack for my wife, who uses a set of E2c's with her iPod. She somehow managed to lose one of her sleeves, and meanwhile - over the course of a change in residence - we had lost track of the set of sleeves that came with the earphones. Enter Amazon - I had to take a guess as to which ones she was using, so I eneded up betting on the variety pack. Fortunately, one pair of this set was the right one. My guess is that this is the same set of sleeves that was included with the E2c's.I just wish they were a little cheaper."
5,Great Addition to E2C,"Unfortunately my e2c's didn't include these, only including the normal hard rubber and foam attachments.I was having problems with my e2c's hurting my ears, and these have been the best thing for them. Unfortunately Amazon wasn't selling this at the time I purchased mine, so I had to pay more and buy them through Shure. If you have Prime and a pair of matching shure in-ear monitors, you'll be a much happier person in 2 days."
1,Frustrating and Incomplete,"This text was required for my university Trig class. Other reviewers have argued that math text books are only supplemental to the material covered in class - that it's the teacher that makes the difference. If that's the case, without a good teacher, this book is nearly useless. Whether the authors are covering fundamentals or advanced concepts/calculations, most everything gets a very cursory, succinct treatment. Should you not understand something covered in class, this text likely will not help to clarify. If you are at all unfamiliar with Trigonometry (as I was going in to this class), this text is not intended to enhance your understanding."
2,Good if you are NOT majoring in Math or Engineering,"This book really lacks proper theory and instruction. The book focuses more on giving you problems than it does trying to explain the principle and aspect covered in Trigonometry. If you are are looking for a book that can help you out by giving you work(math problems), this is it. Otherwise, stay clear of this book, find a book that has more instructions, more theories, simply more."
5,Elizabeth Cook Made a Marvelous Album,"I really like this album. It is truthful, sometimes tap your toes, sometimes a little tearful, some times whoop and jump. She's great. Just Great!"
3,"Good, but....","Good record in her traditional singing style, but not up to her new record ""Balls"". Too much record companty production without understanding Elizabeth's true style. Buy it to understand how far she has come with a producer that knows how to get her best performance as with ""Balls""."
5,A LOT OF FOG,This machine is small but packs a punch. It takes the normal amount of time to heat up and fits in pretty small places so great for haunted houses.
2,"Used once, then failed","It worked great out of the box. Filled it up, let it sit for 2 years, then tried it again -no longer pulled the fluid. Company says $35 labor plus parts and shipping. Into the garbage it goes. A new one is $69. A throw away society indeed. Made in China trash. Save your money, find a better fog machine. They must be out there, at least ones that have a pump which doesn't clog or burn out. I will never buy another Un-Amercian DJ product again."
1,I will return it.,"I will first call American DJ, but upon pressing the button after a 5 minute warm up this loud buzzing sound happened, which shouldn't happen. I am sure the others are good."
4,nice,This fog machine produces a nice amount of fog seems sturdy and well builtI would recommend a timer be used with this item (not included).
4,Interesting read,Not sure how much I believe birth order really matters but the book is very convincing and a well researched read. Easy to read and humorous. I like how Dr. Leman describes the complicated process of interpreting birth order physchology - why some families/children don't fit the trends.
4,shipped fast!,I love Luther Vandross music so I bought this cd. I was worried bout it being used. But it was in great conditon and I recieved faster then i excepted. I LOVE the song Make Me a Believer. I don't know why that song doesnt ever get mentioned with his other great songs
5,Luther's third album offers a good mix of Quiet Storm ballads and uotempo Funk.,"Released in 1983, ""Busy Body"" was Luther's third album for Epic Records. The uptempo dance tracks ""I Wanted Your Love"", ""I'll Let You Slide"" and the slammin', heat-generating workout ""For The Sweetness Of Your Lovin' "" are classic examples of early-'80s Funk while the ballads ""Busy Body"", ""Make Me a Believer"" and his sultry yet passionate duet with Dionne Warwick (""How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye?"") foreshadow the direction Luther's subsequent albums would take. The ultra-lush Quiet Storm gem ""Superstar/ Until You Come Back To Me"" was this CD's masterpiece, however, and is the one that makes it a must-have. Starting with his next CD (1985's ""The Night I Fell In Love"") Luther's albums would have more and more ballads and only a couple of dance tracks. Enjoy!"
4,I'm pleased,"My TIKI cups arrived yesterday, and I was pleased with them. They will go good at my out door end of the summer party."
5,great mugs,"great mugs, arrived early and in great shape... can't wait to have a tiki party!!! love the names for the mugs"
1,"Great Product, wish I could have used them","Wish I had listened to the previous reviewers - The mugs are awesome, but one arrived broken. Mugs are great, but now I have to look elsewhere.Mugs arrived in a big Amazon box and on the inside, the mugs were wrapped in a single sheet of small bubble wrap around the product box (not even marked fragile) . Unable to return only the broken mug for a replacement, have to send them all back and get a refund. Disappointing. I doubt I will order again unless it is another company and the reviews are not that it arrives broken. If you order them and they arrive in one piece - you will be happy. However, if the packing I had is the norm, then do not expect it."
3,Not bad enough to send back,"The Emerson Radio CKS5055S arrived on schedule. The internal battery was dead and could not be revived after charging for several hours. After inserting a new battery, the clock worked. However, the ""buttons"" that need to be depressed to set the time zone, hour and minute were damaged and only after repeated pressing, the clock was set to the proper time. Once set, the clock seems to work fine - it will be interesting to see if the clock automatically adjusts the hour when daylight savings time ends. This is the fourth Emerson Radio clock I have owned - the other three worked properly ""out of the box"". This clock is a replacement for one of the others that was damaged by a power surge following a storm. I like the clock but expect products that are not more than 5 years out of date."
4,Great clock radio,Really like this radio/alarm. Dual alarms is a must. Power outage...no worry. Battery back-up keeps clock running and on time. Display is large and easy to read. I recommend this to others.
2,Not very good,"I really like Johnny Bush, but this album certainly is not among his best.. There are only a couple of tunes that even sound like him. Willie Nelson appears on the album and adds some value but the rest of the album is not very good at all."
1,Not enough honky tonk,"I love Johnny Bush and have almost all of his CDs. I hate to be negative, but this CD is way too mellow and has too much non-honkytonk/shuffle music for me. The swing/jazz stuff isn't what I want to hear. I miss the Johnny Bush of ""Talk to My Heart,"" ""Green Snakes,"" and especially ""Lost Highway Saloon,"" which I consider to be Bush's masterpiece. His recent album with Justin Trevino is pretty good, but I guess that as Johnny gets older he gets more mellow."
4,Brava Diva!,"Dame Kiri Te Kanawa sings some of her most famous pieces on this 1983 compilation album from CBS Masterworks. Most of the recordings date between 1979-1983, with no real variance in sound quality, and the disc is offered at a bargain price. Real vintage Kanawa, simply superb.Dame Kiri performs the ""Der Kleine Sandmann"" from Humperdinck's ""Hansel und Gretel""; ""Mi Tradi"" from Mozart's ""Don Giovanni""; and ""Vissi D'Arte"" from Puccini's ""Tosca"". Also featured are pieces from Walton, Faure, Verdi and Schubert among others.If you are just beginning to collect Dame Kiri recordings, or are confused where to begin, this CD is a good place to start.[CBS Masterworks/Columbia MK 39208]"
4,Good Book,"This is a good book, it has good info and pics, but is not very complete, you'll find yourself in need of other references very often."
3,review of the book by fitzpatrick dermatology,"As it says, it is a really an atlas rather than a textbook. As an atlas so I think it is good but the clinical synopsis is not well written. One cannot really learn from the discussion given in the text. The etiology of each disease in not discussed and if it is then it is not clear and is not well explained. It is relatively inexpensive so this is also an advantage but other than this there is no advantage over other books with respect to to the explanation in the text."
5,Great pics!,"I really like this book. The descriptions and pictures are very helpful. Also includes differential diagnoses, course and prognosis, and management. A favorite in our ER."
5,Produce as describes.,Product as described!!!! Happy with the purchase. Wish there was more description about the book (ISBN etc). More infomation is always helpful in taking decision about used items.
4,Awesome Purchase!,I needed this book and was able to purchase it for a fraction of the cost. It was in great condition as the owner had said. No problems!
2,The Optometrist's Guide to Dermatology,"I have recently found that with this book I not only can diagnose lesions on the face, but also on almost every part of the body. As a result I now save my patients money by diagnosing them myself instead of having to refer them to a specialist. My only complaint about the book is that I feel it uses unnecessary jargon in places."
2,Damaged book,The package the book came in was smashed. The book appeared as if it had been used. It took over 2 weeks for it to arrive. I wouldn't order any books from amazon again
5,"A Great Scanner, But... You Get What You Pay For","Given the price, this is a great film scanner. But, it's not perfect.First, it produces wonderful images with color depths up to 42 bits. Its scratch-removal system (FARE) works well (within limitations), and it seems reasonably quick (though I have nothing with which to compare it). Since it supports both SCSI-2 and USB, its versatility is hard to find - even in more expensive models. Setup was a snap. I just plugged it into my (Windows ME) USB port, added the software and voila!There are some limitations: Unlike competing Nikon models, there are no accessories. And the scanner is made for 35mm only (slides, negatives and APS). As I said above, FARE seems to work very well. But if a negative is too scratched, the software will fail and may even hang your system."
2,not the best,I did not realize that is was no Epson Photo paper and did not work as well as the Epson paper does.
4,Proarch Insole,The proarch is very comfortable for a flat foot just enough arch support. The only problem i have is the soft pad on the supports wear out pretty fast within 2-3months and then become uncomfortable. i only wish they had this in full length.
2,different product,"The arches I received when I ordered these were different than the picture. Instead of being the blue ProArch I'd gotten in the past, they were green, and seem much harder than the old ones. I think there was a product substitution? or maybe they've been redesigned- but if that's the case they are not improved!"
5,What every sci-fi fan wants!,"Time Passport captures your attention from start to finish. And like any good sci-fi adventure it puts you right in to the center of the action and keeps you there. Terrific detail of the sea, equipment and time travel combined with a very imaginative plot make this work of fiction very believable! This is a fun read and I couldn't put it down."
4,great book,"""Dream Travel"" is a book about the phenomenon of out-of-body travel, worlds nonphysical, life after death, inner godmen, spiritual growth, and more. The author relates his first and subsequent projections into the etheric dream worlds. Descriptions of the inner planes, what can be seen and done there, how to project into the nonphysical worlds, all are included. Can be consciously experienced and verified by anyone. Easy to read and understand; 108 pages in length."
4,Dream Travel Review,"I have just finished reading Dream Travel by Terrill Willson, and I must say that it has opened up a whole new world for me. Upon reading about the adventures Mr. Willson had during his OOBE's, I decided that I too want to experience in these extraordinary events. Mr. Willson offers simple advice in achieving OOBE's and soul travel. I have since put his advice into practice, and experienced travel into the realm of the unknown. Whether your a skeptic or a believer, I challenge you to read this book, and walk away without wanting to pursue Dream Travel first hand."
2,"Wedgy factor, good tummy control","I've purchased many Spanx products which I can happily boast about yet I'm very disappointed with this product. I purchased it and wore it under a cotton sundress. As soon as I got out of my car, I felt an annoying wedgy. This went on all day long. Every bending movement I made provoked the panty to slip out of place and accumulate on my behind defeating its purpose.It was also very tight on the edges in my inner thigh which caused some irritation.It does have excellent tummy control and doesn't roll down on the waist but it was a little tight on the waistband which was evident over the dress.In my opinion, this product is surely not worth it."
2,Don't waste your money,I should have listened to the other reviews about these. The waist does in fact roll down. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. They don't seem to be any more shaping than regular highwaisted underwear. Control top panty-hose does a much better job of smoothing (and are much cheaper)
1,Spanx hipsters,These are the worst fitting pants EVER. Very very disappointed in the way they fit.If you want the worst wedgie ever these are for you.
2,picture different from actual item,"I really want to find a pair of firm fitting panties, and heard about this on Oprah. I looked it up and decided to try a pair, and the photo showing them looked like a hipster style support panty. When I recieved them, I could pull them up way over my belly button! Why is it so hard to find a supportive simple panty that doesn't look like my Granny's???N.C. in CA"
3,Good but not great...,"I found Perahia'a performance excellent, but the orchestral accompaniment is bland. The quality of the recording isn't very high. There's a certain charm in Murray's humming along with the orchestra, and I don't mind hearing the sheets being turned, but he must have worn a bracelet or noisy cufflinks that metallically click and rattle distractingly."
4,Good for the money,"This little watch is stylish and useful. Tons of features and great ideas, however, it is claimed to be water ""resistant"" to 65 meters, which is more than 3 feet, but when I got in the hot tub with it, it failed and leaked.Otherwise, a good looking watch with multi-purpose"
3,Nice look but poor battery life,"The watch has a really nice appearance and I have received many compliments. It looks like a much more expensive watch and no one believes that it is so inexpensive. However, the battery life is very poor and I have gone through 3 watches in the past 2 years. You can buy it for the looks but don't expect longevity."
3,Great features but doesn't last long,"I love the features and I have never had so many complements on a watch before but the watch only lasts about 6mos. I have bought 3 of them, one every 6 mos, and the first thing I do is toss out the cheap band and put a stainless steel one I have (that doesn't break!). It looks great with the silver and black, love to have a watch with just these same features but a little better quality."
5,It is worth my time to say how I love this book,"I value a great book on spirituality when it has the essence of Truth, simplicity and clarity. This is the kind of book I wish to give to everyone. Very rare a spiritual book can and should be given to anyone. This one can be easily accepted by avid spiritual seeker and anyone having the desire to evolve by starting with oneself. It give such understanding to all the unanswered questions we have related to the lost of abundant joy,our childhood was so rich once.If you like this book, I would also recommend Andrew Cohen's book, Embracing heaven & earth for one more easy read, yet, to the point keys to Truth.Enjoy!"
5,Only fear dies,"Great book, read it in 2 weeks on my commute to work.Will re-read.Was delivered and in perfect condition!"
2,BE WARNED....,"The fact that it says RIGHT ON THE COVER that this DVD isn't an ""authorized"" product of Fleetwood Mac, should have tipped me off. I must have either been on drugs or had 20 bucks burning a hole in my pocket when I bought this. There is NO FM music in this DVD, there are several factual inaccuracies, and there are no interviews with anyone really important ( no one closely associated with the band, just a few random people who played with them back in the sixties, and two members of the British fan club, of all things .) The few rare pictures shown of FM in concert and things were of only slight interest, and saved this from a one star rating. SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!! There are MUCH better FM DVD documentaries out there, most of them authorized, like the ""Classic Albums"" series that features ""Rumours""."
1,"Unauthorized, Inaccurate and Horrible!","The negative reviews I've read are right on target. I, like others, bought this DVD because I'm a Fleetwood Mac freak and for the inexpensive price, I thought I'd give it a chance. Just because it's unauthorized doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to be awful, right? But, this is so bad that it's almost painful to watch.It's terribly inaccurate - and for those of us who are huge fans, this DVD is maddening to watch because things are said that simply aren't true. The ""experts"" have very little connection to Fleetwood Mac - in some cases, they have NO connection to the band. There's no Fleetwood Mac music (I'm sure that's because it's unauthorized) and no film clips, either. There's nothing redeeming about the DVD. I would have rated it a ""0"", but my review couldn't be posted without giving it at least a ""1."""
2,Only if you want your collection REALLY complete,"The best part about the DVD is that we get to see & hear Bob Brunning, a temporary bass guitarist near the beginning of FM. He is well-spoken and speaks well of the band. Other than that, it flies through information you might already know, leaving out many facts and figures, making the documentary both somewhat inaccurate and incomplete. The fact that it is ""unauthorized,"" is probably the reason behind the omission of FM music, though some of the original music is acceptable. I did not find it a complete disappointment, but I also found no reason to cheer."
2,Don't Bother,"This documentary has no Fleetwood Mac music,and no involvment of the key band members. There were several inaccuracies in the information presented. It did include some nice rare photos of the 1975 lineup with Nicks and Buckingham but overall is not really worth the money"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Don't bother wasting your money on this inaccurate documentary, which doesn't even feature video footage of any of the band members. The people being interviewed for this documentary are not precise when they mention the Buckingham/Nicks history of Fleetwood Mac."
1,Big let down,You would think this new dvd would have interviews from the current band members. None are to be found. All of this information is pretty much accurate but I found a couple of things that were not so. The only highlight of this movie was the photo gallerey and even that is a let down. Save your money. Or spend it on other Fleetwood Mac items.
3,"not essential, but not as horrible as some have made it sound","When I first read the reviews on this dvd I was expecting an absolute atrocity of a mac bio. I was suprised because its not as bad as almost everyone has said it is. true, there are definate inaccuracies and no fleetwood mac music to be found, but there is some interesting commentary and alot of great photos. though I must admit VH1 behined the music and the classic albums dvd are both way better. All in all not essential but you could do worse."
5,CAUTION: For serious Mac fans only!!,In reply to the first post....I am one of those UK fans Louise to be precise oh and.....I don't think I am a geek just a fan.....this is an independent production of which Fleetwood Mac are aware. The producers at Passport Entertainment invited Fleetwood Mac to take part but they were in the middle of their tour...
1,"terrible camera work, unprofessional","video shot by a person who does NOT want you to see any of the places that are photographed - starting a sequence with a tight zoom on some architectural detail is ok (kinda) but then panning along the stupid light post instead of zooming out gives the viewer nothing but a headache trying to see outside the frame - trying to see bigger scene (the one operator neglected to include).there is no point discussing the places included because all of it is shot in that awful manner.plus, lets not forget, the huge obtrusive text labels that are blocking half the view and are on screen for the whole duration of some shotsplus - low resolution obvious compression artifacts - unsuitable camera - not high quality videoto some up: more than a waste of money, it is a waste of time watching it looking for any decent footageavoid!!!"
3,Good product but not perfect,"This does a little better job than many of the totally manual abrasive devices for feet. I am 70 and have feet that have been used a lot. I have many other devices and have had corns, calluses etc. Those sometimes pass with change in footware, but I always have SOME problems. This product is good and may be better for those who have someone to assist on foot bottoms, but I found it pretty good even for me as I do my own"
5,Wow,These shoes are beautiful and they fit great. Although I had to return the ones I ordered because I ordered a size up worrying about them being to short or tight and they were the exact opposite unfortunately they were out of my size.
2,Choppy animation. Uninteresting music. Definitely not worth it.,"After purchasing Atmospherex Exotic Robotics, I was really looking for another dvd with visuals and great music. This video was particularly amazing because of the clean smooooooth graphics.Amazon recommended this product to me, and in my excitement, I purchased vol 1 2 and 3!What a mistake. Within seconds of hitting play I was already dissapointed in the graphics. It was too choppy and didnt seem to follow the beat of the music in anyway shape or form.Please dont waste your time if you are looking for a psychedelic colorful fluid visual experience."
2,Deceptive Listing,"Do not for one minute believe this part of the product description:Format: Color, DVD, Widescreen, NTSCThese disks are full screen, chopped and fitted for regular TV."
