4,tijuana straights,I'm not finished yet but so far it has been a good book. A little different as far as writing style but easy to get in to.
4,MEXICO AND SURFING,I love the ocean and I really enjoyed this book with the excitement and the love interests. It's too bad that Mexico has gotten so violent with the drug wars because I always liked just 'chilling' out after a morning of surfing and then a feast of fish tacos and cold beer. Author Nunn catches the essence of surfing and the ocean -he's been there and done that. A good book - I recommend it.
1,Not worth the headache,"Setting up your personal code is a complete pain. The lock broke while I was trying to set the code, so I never actually got to use it and had to return it to amazon. For a while I thought it was just bad luck, but I have a friend that just bought the same type of lock from another vendor and it also broke while they were setting the lock. The locking mechanism just seems to be cheaply made."
2,Glad Janelle Denison was in it.,Otherwise it would have been a total waste of money. Janelle Denison story is the best of the three stories included in this nightmare book. I thought the other two stories were boring at best and stupid at worse. You might wanna pick this one up in the bargain book section but you sure do not wanna pay full price.
4,A Sexy book,This book is very good. I had difficulty putting it down. Even though some parts were kind of confusing over all I found it very sexy and full of romance!
3,.,"**spoiler alert** About MaryJanice Davidson'sMy first thought when Jack took over Ken's body was ""Wouldn't that be funny if he had cirrhosis of the liver and Jack dies again soon?""And if Ken was 'riddled with STDs' than I hope the sex scene involved a condom."
3,A poor copy of the original action movie,"I have yet to read a comic adaptation of an action movie that comes anywhere near doing it justice and this one is no exception. This is exceptionally difficult when it is a science fiction movie set in the exotic location of a Mars colony as the scenery, action and sound effects are missing.All you can really get from this comic is the general story of a Mars colony that is in essence a corporate prison and the Schwarzenegger character is some kind of double agent that is betrayed by the ruthless boss of Mars. He then betrays the boss and joins the cause of the common people in the fight against the ruthless corporate entities.I enjoyed the movie due to the plot twists and turns and the great scenery set on Mars. A weak copy of the original, this comic can serve as a primer to launch a desire to see the movie, but is a poor substitute for watching it."
4,A true house classic.,"House music has always been about simplicity. Simple beat, layered over simple lyrics, layered over and over like a fine woven fabric. Percolator is a fine example of that process. The percise layering of the hypnotizing perculating beat over simple but to the point lyrics is what makes this song such a house dance classic. Weave it into any dance set and watch the crowd reaction."
2,Not worth the money,"This book/supplement contains some interesting NPCs, freinds, comapanions and the such. Each is completely detailed as to name, background, etc. No new rules or any ""crunch"".For a busy DM without a lot of imagination- it could be useful. Otherwise, not.Well illustrated and printed, however."
2,Save your money.,"Disappointed in Amazon, they can't count. The product page lists the book as 64 pages; this is incorrect. This product is only 31 pages, including the table of contents, not the 64 pages as advertised.I think 15.00 is way too steep for this sized book - it turns out there are 15 single page mini write ups for a creature, which amounts to a picture, three 'hooks', and a stat block, ending with a few paragraphs of fluff.Save yourself the money. I'm very disappointed, usually Bastion's offerings were better.Per Amazon:Product Details* Paperback: 64 pages* Publisher: Bastion Press (May 1, 2003)* Language: English* ISBN-10: 1592630049* ISBN-13: 978-1592630042* Product Dimensions: 10.8 x 8.2 x 0.1 inchesLegends Collection: Friends & Familiars Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.0 Sourcebook)"
3,Good but too small,I purchased this item and it is of good quality but way too small. I wish I had purchased the larger size.
3,Good price but not the taste,"The price is nice, but the taste of a marginal quality milk chocolate, not smooth, barely chocolaty. I am not even sure it if chocolate. I've eaten chocolates in many countries and this one on a scale from 1 to 10 is about 1. Will not buy it again, will look for quality vs price."
5,Excellent resource,"For a layperson who is helping a historic cemetery raise funds, this is an excellent resource. It's easy to follow and helpful for ""making the case"" to potential funders and local community leaders for the preservation of historic cemeteries."
4,Basic Essential,The book is essential for those are considering any type of cemetery restoration or preservation. It gives good basic information and explains what some of the obstacles you may cross.
4,Graveyard Preservation,A well written book with plenty of research information to help with restoring the Seligman Arizona cemetery
4,Very helpful,"My son is working on his Eagle Scout project which is to clean and restore gravestones in a local graveyard dating back to the mid 1800s. This book helped us develop a scope of the project by suggesting an approach to mapping, surveying then cleaning/restoring/resetting the gravestones. We have found no other reference like it. Dense text, would have loved a few more photos, but all in all, a great reference for an unusual project."
2,"Beta Glucan is good, but who is Beth M. Ley?","I use NSC Beta Glucan, it's a great immune booster and my daughter who has Lupus uses it and has for several years. I discovered in my research to find out Beth Ley's credentials, that she received her Ph.D. from one of those online schools that you just pay for a degree, see this website for all the information:[...]I have a hard time with a professing Christian not being truthful about her education.NSC Beta Glucan is micronized, which means it works better than just regular beta glucan. Do your research."
4,"Discover the Beta-glucan secret, why don't we hear about this?",This book is a good synopsis of the information given in Dr. Vetvicka's book Natures Secret. It explains well how beta-glucan stimulates the immune system and is a good and safe supplement to take. Amy Howell
2,More of a reference book,"I was a bit disappointed by this book. It is written more like a reference book than something you can read through to learn the material. It is full of various equations with little in the way of ""plain english"" explanations. If you are VERY comfortable with vector math and looking at lots of equations, then this book may be a good reference. If you are looking for understanding basic concepts, then you will need to look elsewhere."
3,Not for the beginner,Book uses a very analytical approach. Concepts are very poorly explained and derviations are not explained. As a text this book is well suited as a review for graduate level students. Using the word introductory in the title is very misleading. Do not recommend this book to those looking for an introduction to the world of computer vision.
2,My head almost exploded!,"I originally purchased this book for a graduate-level computer vision course. I found the book more obfuscating than helpful. For example, Trucco and Verri's discussion of PCA/SVD, a topic I know quite a bit about, left me confused and frustrated. Unfortunately, their treatment of other topics is not any better.I have since used the book as a reference on a couple occasions. My opinion of the book has been raised only slightly since my first read, taking my rating all the way up to two stars ;). I suggest that you DO NOT waste your money on this book."
1,LT should be a Las Vegas Lounge Singer,"Sorry folks, but this album sounds like 1) a pale imitation of his brother James and 2) a lounge singer straining to stay in tune. The song writing is insipid and bland. I am a James Taylor fan and thought I'd give this a try. Doesn't work - found most of the songs unimaginative and trite and often LT sounds out of key. Save your money and buy something else."
4,A great web browser with minor flaws.,"OmniWeb 5 is the best browser I have ever used. It's fast, has many useful features, and is all around good.Pros:*Graphical tabbed browsing*Built-in ad blocking*Very advanced*WorkspacesCons:*Uses an older version of WebCore; should be updated to WebKit.*No per-site CSSThese aren't deal breakers, though. I would reccommend OmniWeb to anyone that needs a secure, fast, advanced browser."
4,Funk Metal,I like the first 2 albums better. This album is more metal than funk. The others are first Funk then Metal :)Trujillo's bass lines are REALLY REALLY awasome.
5,Wonderful book!,"My wife bought ""Being Good to Your Husband on Purpose"" and loved it so much that she asked me to read it as well. Not only are the points in it well made and biblically sound, but they are truly life (and marriage) changing. Becky Hunter has revealed to us that being a good wife is the purposeful effort of a strong woman, and not the passive, weak willed process that much of current culture has portrayed it to be. This book has brought my wife and I closer together and in the process, closer to God."
5,One of the Best!,"I read books on marriage trying to have a better relationship with my husband. This is one of the best I have read so far. Becky explains all in a very simple and direct way. The words are easy to understand. This book has given me a peace of mind of what I am doing (which I used to be in doubt, or didn't know why). Highly recommended!"
4,"Brilliant Pianist, Dull Accompaniment","Young Japanese pianist Ayako Uehara originally got my attention with a performance of this same Tchaikovsky First Concerto with the NHK Symphony Orchestra conducted by Charles Dutoit. I personally think that performance was the best I've come across outside of the legendary Van Cliburn/Kondrashin performance, if not an equal to it. (The Dutoit performance can be accessed on YouTube.) Uehara's brilliance can still be heard on this one, but is badly hindered by what I think was a lethargic and seemingly-clueless reading by the conductor. The dynamics of the recording are compressed to boot.In my opinion, Ayako Uehara is one of the most-exciting young stars in the classical music world that I've experienced in quite some time. Although it may not seem overly obvious with this CD. I've also witnessed some great Rachmaninoff and Mozart from Ayako as well."
4,Not performed in its traditional manner....,"I found Uyehara's interpretation to be delightful and sensitive, although tempo is a bit slow. I hear nothing Japanese about it unless one has a prejudice about asian classical musicians. Van Cliburn she ain't but this is a change from the forcefulness one usually hears from this piece."
5,Tchaikovsky: Piano Concerto No. 1; Mussorgsky: Pictures at an Exhibition,Purchase this one. Tchaikovsky: Piano Concerto No. 1; Mussorgsky: Pictures at an ExhibitionYoung Japanese pianist Ayako Uehara with a performance of this Tchaikovsky First Concerto . AN INTERSTING performance other legendary performances are by Van Cliburn/Kondrashin and also Rubenstein.Ayako Uehara is an exciting -gifted- young star in the classica lpiano musicBoth the Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky pieces are at the top of my essential recommended basic repertoire compositions classical
4,"It isn't easy to find ""Pictures"" in the original","Which is to say on solo piano. I don't recall how the decision was made, but ""Pictures At an Exhibition"" was originally composed this way. Then Maurice Ravel of ""Bolero"" fame, who was always more of an arranger than a composer anyway, got hold of it and arranged it for orchestra. Over the years, the version you're getting here faded to near-obscurity and now most people think Ravel's arrangement is the way it's done, period. When I was a freshman in college I came across the Vladimir Horowitz reading of this version in the library, the LP so beat to hell that I thought of it as the ""Kellogg Version""--you know, snap crackle and pop. And I don't understand why the piano version is so tough to find. It's ironic that my initial foray into retail downloading turns up this piece done on the old 88's. Think of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto, which is a lot easier to find, as a prelude to make this a 75-minute album."
3,"nicely done, one of the better volumes of freezone","Let me hit on some noteworthy tracks first:Blue, brown and blackSaturatedYouSeek Jesus for peaceSpace ContinuumStarRipplingMina's bluesSoul Magic 98These tracks reminded me of what this cd genre is about. The rest of the tracks I don't speak so highly of just b/c they were too weird or repetative. This volume does a decent job of bringing downtempo to your bachelor pad and filling the rooms with mind-bending rhythyms....pick it up used if you can."

There's a better compilation out there, it's called OM Lounge."
3,"Radio outtakes, poor packaging","This disc may be of interest to Phil Harris collectors, but it isn't a good choice for someone wanting a starter collection. As the poor liner notes say, ""the majority of the tracks ... are extracted from the 1949 season"" of Harris' radio show. You would never know this until you paid for and opened the disc. For the most part the sound quality is good, and the performances are lively."
4,"Hey mon, this is FUN Christmas music!","Tired of the same old Christmas carols? One more syrupy rendition of White Christmas going to send you over the edge? This CD will lift your holiday spirits and actually have you looking forward to the dreaded family get-togethers. So, fire up the ganga, and have a Natty Christmas!"
5,Excellent read,This book was very well written and extremely captivating. I read the whole thing in 1 day!!! Can't wait for more books from the author.
3,Nice story,NICE STORY. Editing and proofing errors were distracting. Will look for more by this author. I want to see the other books in this series.
5,Hard to put down,This is a great book that presents an inspirational character who faces her struggles with the help of God and triumphs over adversity. You are drawn into the world of her struggles with the past and the present.
4,Bitter Water,"Bitter Water by Sherri Smith is a book that you will want to get cozy with. Set in a small town in Illinois, it is a story of a family torn apart by the sin of another. It is a reminder that when sin rears its ugly head, it always has consequences. Sometimes we are the victims of our own sins, and sometimes we are the victims of the sins of others.Bitter Water is a story of hope. No matter how bad life may seem to be, there is always hope and help for those who seek it. It is also a story of forgiveness. Where there is forgiveness there is always hope.Let Sherri take you on a journey that you will enjoy from beginning to end."
1,Looked great but didn't last long...,"I was very pleased when this item arrived. It was easy to assemble, looked great, and functioned as expected. However, about one month after I got it, the stand snapped in half, and it is not fixable. I used an inexpensive ($25) wooden stand for years with the same load, and didn't have this problem. I am really disappointed that such an expensive stand did not prove to be durable."
4,"Attractive, practical design","The Adesso Quatro Coat Rack features an attractive design, sturdy construction, and best of all, an abundance of hooks for hanging garments. You wouldn't imagine that finding a practical coat rack with a contemporary design would be all that difficult, but until I stumbled across this beauty, I had all but given up hope. Most modern designs offer only the bare minimum of coat hooks, while most racks with an abundance of hooks slant toward the ""traditional"" in appearance. After a relatively painless assembly process (all of the pieces just twist together), I was relieved to have an eye-pleasing workhorse of a coat rack in front of me. Recommended for people who need a coat rack (obviously), but don't want one that looks like an antique wooden table leg."
2,Good looking but not durable,"Finding an inexpensive, contemporary coatstand was difficult so I was happy when I found and ordered the Adesso Quatro. Unfortunately, after 1 year the coatstand has broken. The weld that holds the stand to the base cracked and cannot be repaired. This coatrack had limited use so I would not recommend its quality. Keep looking."
1,Give it about a year...,"...before the coat rack snaps in half. This item was a gift for Christmas in 2008 and the product did not make it through the year.Essentially the fitting that connects the top to bottom is made of plastic and after enough use it will begin to give. Once this starts, there is no way to brace the pole from bending further and eventually falling. I now have a nice dent in my wall to prove it."
4,Simple and functional coat rack,"Simple, contemporary, functional design. Looks great in a modern apartment. I've had this coat rack for 3 years now. The coat rack has hooks in the top and middle of the rack plus an umbrella stand at the bottom. There's plenty of room for coats, scarves, and hats. I have about 6 heavy coats on it now. My only complaint is that it is not very sturdy - the coat rack frequently ""loosens"" at the base and I have to tighten every few months or so."
5,Easy to assemble,"I purchased this item a month ago and finally got around to assembling it today because when I first opened the box, I was put off by the number of pieces. However, everything was in its own little plastic bag and very neatly packed. To my surprise, it was very easy to put together. All of the pieces were there, and the instructions were logical and easy to follow. I was pleasantly surprised that it only took me about 30 minutes. Had I known it would go so smoothly, I would have put it together sooner. As others have said, the style of this coat rack is contemporary. It has a heavy, sturdy base and does not look like it will tip easily. This coat rack is just what I was looking for."
3,Don't Believe Phony Reviewers,"""Who is Ethan Bortnick you may ask? Ethan Bortnick was born December 24, 2000. He started reading at the age of two and speaks Russian and English. At age four he began studying with Mila Vaserstein. I first saw him on the Jay Leno Show and was quite impressed. I mean he couldn't even reach the pedals from the piano.""Look at the last name of the previous reviewer: ""Vaserstein."" What an amazing coincidence that the glowing review was written by someone with the same last name as this kid's teacher!"
3,VHS,the movie is old to begin with and in black and white but the copy is poor..it jumps around on the screen and has wavy things happening...its a vhs..tried to the tracking on the vcr...still nothing..so.not sure if the orders are copys among copies...the more copies you make over and over again..not using the orginal...can be poor quality...to make copys one should use the orginal to make the copys not the copy...anyhow..trying to enjoy the movie with wavy picture...not going to pay more money for a dvd...
3,A fun vintage movie.,We enjoyed this movie once we were able to transfer the tape to another tape. It arrived broken.
1,Avoid like the plague,there is nothing to speak of. It was horrible. Totally misleading and waste of money and worst of all your time!!!.
2,As apocalypse sci fi this comes off as more of a religious tract,Several predictions based on different calendars and calculationsmake 2012 the Mayan predicted end of the world. This movie tries to make secular Christian use of that in a pretty blatant way.The sci fi science basis of the planet standing stillis pretty much nonsense. With global warming being a current concernI think movies like this one are not a very good thing.
1,What DVD ?,Sent it to the wrong city. Never did get this product. Their gain my loss. Why they sent it to the wrong city is anybody's guess. I will not be back!!!!!!!!!!
1,"If A Movie Could Get A ZERO, This Would Be It!","Someone stated that this was amateurish work. Actually, I've seen BETTER work by amateurs. This was a complete waste of celluloid. I'm not sure why anyone would have TARNISHED their reputation as an actor to be associated with this production.Is there anything ELSE worth saying?This film does NOTHING to explain the 2012 ideology. It is horrible. This film is full of people who can't act. The script is just atrocious. The premise: is there one? The disappearing woman who wears lip gloss in a color way to young for her. The pregnant woman who delivers in the Mayan temple...Why was SHE added in the mix?The rescue worker who was in dire need of a shrink LONG before this 'event' happened. And...as the rest of the world collapses (literally), they are all SAFE in this Myian temple that opens with a CRUCIFIX? Oh puleeze."
2,GOOD INTENTIONS...BAD MOVIE,"THIS IS A RELIGIOUS PRODUCTION WITH A MESSAGE AND THERE CERTAINLY ADMIRABLE IN ITS INTENT TO ENCOURAGE HOPE IN TROUBLED TIMES. BUT THAT DOESN'T FORGIVE INEPTITUDE FROM THE FILMMAKERS.THE MOVIE IS DULL AND PREACHY TOO MUCH OF THE TIME. FANS OF THE DISASTER GENRE WILL DEFINITELY BE DISAPPOINTED. THERE'S VERY LITTLE TIME SPENT ON THE ACTUAL DISASTERS AND WHAT LITTLE THERE IS IS POORLY DONE. GUESS THIS FALL'S ""2012"" BIG BUDGET PIC WILL DO THAT.THE ACTING IS POOR EVEN FROM USUALLY GOOD ACTORS LIKE CLIFF DEYOUNG AND DALE MIDKIFF BUT I'M NOT SURE MERYL STREEP OR JACK NICHOLSON COULD DO MUCH WITH THIS SCRIPT.IF YOU AREN'T LOOKING FOR MORE THRILLS OR ACTION, YOU MIGHT ENJOY."
1,Not what I expected,Not what I expected......I sure would not buy this movie again at the $24 price tag. I kind of got lost on the date of this movie I thought it was the already released version 2012 in Nov. But that won't be til this year and it's going to be great compared to this one. Save your dollars on this 2008 one and it would be much cheaper for you to just rent it.
1,"Not Even Remotely Based On The Bible, But Pretending To Be A Christian Movie","If they had wanted to make a disaster movie, they should have made a disaster movie. Just don't pretend that it has anything to do with Christianity, because it didn't. Those parts were embarrassing. In fact, there was nothing with any substance to it at all. Those connected with it should be ashamed of themselves. If they try again, I hope they will either make a real Christian movie based on real scripture or leave Christianity out of it entirely and just make a disaster movie."
1,Film Making Has Reached a New Low...,"... and it is this movie. As bas as it gets. Religious propaganda amid abysmal acting, horrible special effects, lousy editing, miserable sound and very poor storyline. It's a waste of time to list the dozens and dozens of examples of D-grade production. Save your money and time and watch your fingernails grow. It will captivate you more."
1,WARNING! Ghastly and disastrous movie,"What a dreadful piece of **¡!#*& ....! This movie is not worth a penny and doesn't even deserve a zero star rating. Besides of being religious propaganda as others have expressed, the acting is mediocre, the script is lousy and the plot is lame. This is another movie that belongs under the classification of ""Garbage Productions"" This is a definite NO, NO!! Be adviced, don't waste your money on this C.R.A.P.! Better wait for the 2012 movie from Roland Emmerich (due next November), I should expect this one to be a lot more enjoyable."
1,2012 doomsday..... I wish it was!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!! I was absolutely appaled by the seriously bad acting and awful effects! At one point we actually saw the camera man's reflection in the car door! the trailer is the whole movie just a much shorter version, and to be honest would be much easier to watch!Please please please do not waste your time!!!! Its now an hour of my life that I cannot get back! And a complete waste of money!!!"
1,THIS IS NOT 2012!,"Do not buy this if you are looking for the Roland Emmerich film ""2012"". This isn't it. This movie is made by a company (The Asylum) which thrives on misleading consumers to buy movies with names similar to the ""real"" studio ones. Save your money, don't buy this!!"
3,Seems more difficult to play than other games,"My daughter loves Bratz and was very excited to get this for her 6th birthday. But, it is a difficult game to play even for me. There are a lot of directions that are very difficult to remember. The pieces don't fit well in the shops. Takes a long time to play although there are alternatives for shortening the playing time."
1,by and for bratz,"Got this game at Ross and is not worth the $4.99. The game is tedious, repetitive (basically you buy things and resell them for more, period), and endless. The pieces are badly designed and unplayable (not enough space on the board to fit all pieces, game pieces are falling). It's all about money changing hands all the time, often in the same amounts, so you are constantly giving each other the same pieces of paper. Only educational value is to count numbers in the thousands and make change. My estimation is that it takes more than 3 hours to finish a game, but became boring after 30mn. What a waste of time."
3,Privateer 2: The Darkening,"Even if this game is considered old school it still provides a high level of entertainment, and with windows xp and dos box version .74 game reliabilty is even better than dos 6.0."
5,Takahashi-san!,"Anything by Takahashi-san is sure to be great, and this one was to my likeing. But fair warning: it'll leave you dieing for the next one!"
5,An Eclectic Composer's Materful Tribute To Brahms,"Surely I can't be the only one who hears Brahms in this masterwork. Itzahk Perlman made a recording of the movie's main theme, and I was actually able to pass it off to a friend of mine as a recently discovered movement from an unfinished Brahms violin concerto. It's a tribute to Bernstein's ability to channel Brahms that my friend actually fell for it for a full five minutes.Few Hollywood composers have been so consistently eclectic in their musical output. Little known fact: Bernstein's theme for By Love Possessed (one of his best scores) was given lyrics and released by a Doo Wop (early rock and roll genre) group called the Four J's. A more unlikely merger of styles would be hard to imagine.Thank you, Mr. Bernstein, for bringing so much beauty (To Kill A Mocking Bird), pleasure (Walk On The Wild Side), and excitement (The Magnificent Seven)--just to mention a few--into my life."
5,A superb journey!,"As a movie fan, I always considered THE AGE OF INOCENCE as a monument, and definitely Martin Scorsese's masterpeace. In my opinion, Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack deserve every award available: it's a wonderful journey to the carachter's souls, and you can remember every wonderful detail and drama that Newland Archer and Ellen Olenska are implied. When the opera appears in the tracks, it's impossible don't be devastated!"
4,Surprisingly Good,"I happened to see this band by chance, and was greatly the impressed. The CD only adds to that impression. The Replacements comparisons are accurate, but this band has the talent to stand on their own. I hope they pass this way again soon!"
4,great live Donizetti,"Those familiar with the popular recital aria ""O Luce di'Quest Anima"" would enjoy this full-length live recording. Margherita Rinaldi was not as adept at coloratura as Joan Sutherland, but she did have secure notes and a good technique. The opera itself is more dramatic than you would think if you were only familiar with O Luce... However, there are moments of pure bel canto enjoyment, such as when Alfredo Kraus sings (and encores!)Se Tanto in Ira agli Uomini. This is an example of superior tenor singing, the kind that has all but disappeared. Kraus is on a par with the ""Three Tenors"", even though he is not known by the general public (which is a shame).Given that this opera is rarely staged (La Scala mounted it 6 years ago with Laura Claycomb), and wasn't recorded by the greats (such as Joan Sutherland), this live recording is an excellent choice."
5,Great resource,"Although this is a great resource it is a bit bulky. Even so, I wouldn't want less material. I appreciate the reproducible sheets so much. I don't have a lot to say that others haven't already said. I do want to recommend another set of books to use directly with the children. It is four Dolch sight word books by Betsy B. Lee. These don't look that much like little kid books and they are even used in middle school and the lower grades. Look up the author's name at amazon."
3,"Helpful Resources, but Poorly Organized","This handbook has mounds of helpful information and reproducible activity sheets, but can be overwhelming to sift through as there are no clear chapters or boundaries. Speaking as a dyslexic occupational therapist who works with children who are dyslexic, this book's format is slightly overwhelming at times. Additionally, the activities have ""grade levels"" written at the top of them which may cause esteem or confidence issues with the children who are likely reading below their grade levels."
3,Complicated Drills,"I found most of the drills to be quite complicated and difficult to implement on the field. I did find some useful drills and others may become more useful in the future as I coach upper age groups, up to U-12 right now. But the time lost explaining the drills and setting them up is better spent on less complex drills with more ball touches per player. I also prefer small sided games to allow the game to teach the players."
5,Excellent service,"Great service, item was exactly as described. Would do business with again soon! Keep up the great work and highly recommend."
5,Good Teaching Bk For beginners,Yeah! At last i find something that i'm really into...well here...there hardly any courses for this game....when i was surfing the net and found out in the net thay sell this kind of thing...i was pretty excited and really want to know what's really in that video clip.... Gotta learn somthing new right?
3,good against a fence,this wont stand on its own for a quick fence. we have cattle fence and we put this over the fence the holes are big enough to allow some varmits and the plastic is soft enough that they could get through. snakes and diffently get through. we used this bcuz we got a little dog and it was the cheapest way to change the fence we had. we attached with zip ties. quick and easy. he does not like the feel to chew it and we attached to the out side. the color takes a bit of getting used to. but it is up and the pup cant get out. mission accomplished.
4,Pretty and cute!,"We registered for these plates and we use them. They are not meant to be serving pieces as the other reviewer says, but a party plate because they act as a saucer and a tray for a small dessert or appetizer. They are more of a novelty item in the set, but they are really fun to use. Everyone always compliments all of our china, but most people are most amused by these cute little plates- we usually use for desserts, with one of the latte or cappuccino mugs."
3,There Is A Better Single Available,"This CD single only has the original ""Alone"" mix and ""Stayin' Alive"" (live) which is remarkable and still has the power acoustically. However, there is another version of this CD single that also has ""Decadance"" (a powerful dance remix of 'You Should Be Dancing') and a fantastic ballad called, ""Rings Around The Moon"". Look for it!"
5,First purchase,Upoon receving the 45a print jet cartridge I found that the box was in perfect condition. I installed it and it works like the original one did. Thnaks for the great service.
1,did not fit,"no measurements are given for this and I thought it would be standard size. However, it was too short. Thought it would save me the trip to th RV store and justify the S&H charge but sadly mistaken."
2,Is Radical Islam . . .,"It was written so long ago, it is not exactly relevant. It was written before 911."
5,Wonderful,I love this CD because I can play it in my car and at work without worrying about lyrics that can be offensive. I also find that kids love to listen to the CD as well.
2,Diner music,"I found this album a little annoying, same beat in background, didn't make out what songs it was playing, I played it several times , just didn't fit the bill for me"
1,"bad,bad,bad","This show is one of the worst excuse for a western I have seen in a long time. We watched one disc, out of boredom, and gave the set away. What a waste of money!"
5,Blast from the Past,"This show ran when I was a small tyke and if my parents didn't watch it, I didn't see it. (Years later I would exact my revenge and wrest control of the tv from them.) So this was a series I was unaware of. Still, I love westerns and gave this a try. Glad I did. A terrific show with fine performances by Barry Sullivan and Clu Gulager. Maybe --like WYATT EARP, BAT MASTERSON -- it wasn't the way it really was, so be it. This small set is a great introduction. Look forward to obtaining the only other set from this series."
5,Loved it!,"Worth every penny to me. Can't beat the old westerns, and the stars of this one were fun to watch. I agree with another reviewer that Clu Gulager should have been interviewed for this DVD set."
5,CABALLE DAZZLES IN DONIZETTI!,"Once again, Montserrat Caballe proves why she was the reigning queen of the bel canto repertoire, especially in this neglected Donizetti gem. Although there is an excellent recording of this opera with Gencer, Caballe's mastery in this performance really reveals the true shadings of the character. This is from the period when Caballe was truly in her vocal prime, and is well worth acquiring, especially given the quality of the recording for such a reasonable price. Also, this recording provides a rich insight into the treasure trove of fairly unfamiliar Donizetti operas which truly deserve to be heard by modern day listeners seeking a refreshing new glimpse into the golden age of bel canto."
2,Horrible sound - beware,"I'm afraid that this is one of those Opera d'Oro issues where you wondered why they bothered. Obviously the fact that this is a rare performance by two artists in top form swayed the decision - but I cannot envisage attempting to listen to it again with much pleasure as the sound is muffled, boomy, indistinct and mono - why so bad for a 1972 concert recording? A pity; consign it to that list of Opera d'Oro sets to be wary of - very much for the devoted Donizetti completist or die-hard fans of the two singers in question. It's a good performance, the chorus and supporting cast are lusty, but, but but...I'm listening as I write to the live Karajan 1958 ""Don Carlo"" which is horribly cut but so much clearer and more pleasant to listen to."
4,Confusion,"The origins of this recording are muddied, though presumably somebody knows the real info. The Amazon blurb says it's the Covent Garden Orchestra, but the recording may in fact be the one that came out on MRF records. The MRF box had a 4-page spread of pictures, and a cast list the same as the one given here. BUT, the leaflet states that the MRF records are from a July '72 performance with the LSO at Royal Festival Hall. Oddly, the MRF box has a complete libretto containing pictures of a completely difference performance at San Carlo in May '72, with different singers [Gencer/Aragall/Bruson - but still Cillario]. Perhaps someone knows if CC was given both at Covent Garden and the RFH - or?? The detective work is fun, if a bit frustrating at times."
5,Must-have book for teachers,"This small but powerful book is a must-have for teaching poetry! As a primary teacher, I have all three volumes: K, 1st, and 2nd. These books are invaluable resources when teaching poetry to young writers. Regie Routman's books are filled with ""real"" students' poems that model and inspire emergent poets. Her books also includes poetry lessons that show you how to teach and highlight various poetry techniques."
5,"An oldie, but goodie","I first purchased this book about ten years ago for each kindergarten teacher in the building where I was the principal. It is terrific for teachers to use in showing students examples of poems written by other young children in first draft and then final form. Routman's ideas for encouraging poetry writing with young children are very realistic and helpful,which is why I chose to purchase the book for my new position as a literacy coach in an all-kindergarten school."
4,ultra light,"This is an incredible little pump.I have managed to crank out 100psi without gut-busting effort.the handle should be pushed from the bottom, otherwise you risk seperating the housing from around the base, which does not affect performance and is easily glued back in place.other than that one weak spot, no complaints."
5,"Its simple, small and really effective","The design on this thing is top notch. The gasket is nice and thick and when it wears out, i expect to be able to find a replacement at the hardware store for a a buck or two. Its a really small pump, but thats a good thing since is super light to take with you, and since its Presta valve only, its likely to be used with road tubes which really don't require much air anyway. I think you could get away with this as your only pump if you wanted. It is a great product!"
4,Solid little pump,"This is a great small pump that can be attached pretty much anywhere on the bike. Only critisim is that it takes a while to inflate a tire, but that's to be expected with a pump of this size."
5,best micro light I've tried,"I was worried that being a micro-mini it would not be usable... but was pleasantly surprised. It takes about 3-3.5 minutes to fill a 23x700c tire to 100psi, will less effort than several larger pumps I've had. It was very easy up to maybe 80 psi, and not too bad to finish after a short rest break and switching hands. Only negative is no thumb-lock on the head, just press on, which may wear out the gasket pretty fast."
3,Check your tire valves first!,"I bought this because it had amazing reviews, and they're all true about how small and light it is. Unfortunately, as a novice with the bike stuff, I didn't realize that my bike doesn't have the kind of ""presta valve"" that this pump matches with, and so I couldn't use it. (I have a mountain bike with a short, wider valve and this doesn't fit over it.) So, make sure you know you have the right kind of valve on your tires before you buy it and I'm sure it will work great as everyone else said."
1,small and meaningless,the size limits its functionality. it's extremely hard to get 120psi since there is no lock on the pump. and it takes forever to inflate a flat tube. don't buy. the road morph g is a way better choice.
1,FOR PRESTA VALVE ONLY,Great little pump BUT its for presta valves only please note that. Other than that 5 star's for grade a material used in making this pump.Made me want to pick up some presta valve tube's but i got to send it back.
1,You need to have a Presta type tire valve,I bought this and I can't use it. Better instructions about how it can only be used with a certain type of (non-standard) tire valve would be ideal.
2,terrible for the price,"This item has no lid and so if you want to heat anything besides butter, it has a wider mouth at the top than its bottom and lets out any ability to heat, water, milk, coffee, etc.The biggest problem, is that the ""pour"" design is a POOR design. Try pouring from this thing at any angle or speed and the contents spill all over.This utensil isn't worth $2."
3,Thin like a measuring cup,"We don't heat butter or things like that too much - occasionally for waffles or special treats. The 1.5 cup capacity is huge for a few tablespoons of butter, but might be practical for heating up some leftover soup. My main gripe with this product is that the stainless steel, even on the bottom, is thin like a measuring cup. If you're only warming up a few pats of butter over a very low flame, then the bottom will have hot spots over the flame and the butter will begin to boil. I'll probably try a cast iron warmer cup since it'll heat more evenly and will stay warm longer."
3,Only halfway,This album only half does it for me. I like his voice and lyrics but found it a bit slow.
3,"Slow burning, very mellow, unobstrusive and comforting sound.","I am always on the lookout for new bands, and somehow my searches led me to these guys. I gave a few listens then forgot about the CD for a while. A couple of months later I threw it in the player again, and found myself singing or humming along to most of the songs. So this slow-burning effort does worm its way into your brain. It is mostly atmospheric, acoustic guitar-based folkies that remind me a lot of Neil Young on his more acoustic work. It does kind of lull you into mellowness, but it is well worth the listen if you are looking for a good CD to chill out with."
4,"Great new Folk, for all us folks...",Bodies and minds is even better than Oniagra from this talented and atmospheric folk rock act! And there latest Amazon exclusive CD w/ bonus tracks is also a great purchase! Check 'em all out. All the Great Lake Swimmers releases.
3,Not useful,"Study guide just asks you to rewrite what you read. It didn't seem to ask questions that really make you think or explore what you learned. Halfway through, I decided to just stick with the book and not use the study guide."
4,Your thoughts are addressed.,"This particular book challenges you to take a good look at yourself and how you think, as well as it is a good tool to use with any ministy teaching venue. Even though these are Joyce Meyers own personal experiences, many of us I am sure have had to deal with or are dealing with some of the same issues that are addressed.Thought provoking book, would recommend it to everyone, I am using it in my women's ministry and it has generated alot of conversations, opinions and possible paths to finding solutions for the women in this group."
3,not what i expected,This is not what I expected it was a work book already written in which I feel it should have been erased completely.
3,Products okay,"The products in it are okay, but the templates are silly and not very usable. I would definitely just get one product and skip the rest of this."
2,Broke the first time I used it,"Sure, it gets the pits out of the cherries. But after just the seventh or eighth cherry, the metal ""stay"" snapped cleanly off. This does not disable the pitting action, it just adds a step to get the cherry off the post. I am thinking of returning it just because I am annoyed that it is so poorly engineered. Otherwise, it works fine and has a lovely shape."
4,This is definitaly worth buying,"I love fresh cherries, but the pits are always so bothersome. Specially when I'm making my Cherry Bread in large batches. Getting through a bag of cherries with this handy little product is a breeze! A couple of my friends thought this little machine was amazing because they had never seen one before. I've been putting fresh cherries in my cocktails and everything!"
5,As refreshing as a summer breeze romance!,This was a great romance suspense novel! I really enjoyed the characters and it really kept me guessing til the very end! Anyone who is a romance suspense lover is sure to love this!
3,Careful research brings history to life.,"Jane Kirkpatrick brings the story of westward expansion to life through the experiences of Marie Dorion, her extended family and friends. The list of actual historical characters near the front of the book helps the reader identify and keep relationships in mind. The author has done her homework for presenting history in a believable and interesting way.Perhaps narrowing her field of characters would make a more readable, but less historically accurate tale."
5,Learing about Madame Dorion!,"Learning about Madame Dorion is a project our DUP Camp has taken on. Our camp is named after her and we decided it would be fun to read this series of books. It has not been a disappointment, but an enriching experience for all who are participating. The books are captivating, inspiring, and hard to put down. As each camp member reads the book, we share it with another! So far, everyone raves about these books!"
5,Every Fixed Star,"Once again I was in awe of Marie and her life during the 1800's. The effort it took just to keep her family warm, fed, clothed and safe is mind-boggling. I think as American women, living in this day & time we tend to forget the horrible hardships and conditions that ""those who have gone before us"" endured. I must continue to remind myself how blest I am to be living in this century with all our modern conviences. Thank you, dear Jane for bringing these stories to us, God has blessed you with a special gift. The next chapter in Marie's life can't come too soon."
3,"Not as good as ""Kinship & Courage"" series","After reading the ""All Together In One Place"", I was expecting a lot more from the Tender Ties series. It's not that they aren't particularly good, they're just not as good as the others of Jane Kirkpatrick's that I've read. The timelines are a little harder to follow because they sometimes skip ahead months and even years. Like I said, it's not that these aren't good books, they just aren't quite what I've come to expect from her."
1,This book has literally taken me months to read...,"...and I still haven't finished it!I started reading Savage Whisper months ago and just couldn't connect with the characters. I usually read a book until I reach page 100. Sometimes books start a little slow, but by then the action gets going. I barely made it to page 50. Several months (actually a year or so ) later after finishing another novel, I reached for this one and started reading. There was something oddly familiar about this book. I then realized after again not being able to connect with the characters that I had already tried unsuccessfully to read Savage Whisper. I read to about page 200 this time and still, felt no connection. I stopped and picked up another novel and easily became attached to the story."
2,Uncomfortable and Pokey,"These earrings are beautiful in the box. But on the ears, they are uncomfortable to wear and are very pokey. The gold is also rather thin so sometimes the cross would bend and be even more uncomfortable to wear. I do not recommend this design unless you would like to be poked."
2,"Poorly organized, too confusing","OK, one thing I must concede is that Welsh is a difficult language to try to teach and learn. However, I feel this program could be better, needs to be better. I haven't finished the program, I'm not even halfway through. Already I have been confused by the incongruence between the recordings and the book, answers in the back of the book that seem to contradict the lessons, and poor organization of the information on the page, especially for visual types like me, the book is a mess! Also, there are apparently two different Welshes - northern Welsh and southern Welsh. The two Welshes use different common expressions and words. This book throws it all at you at once, and it's too confusing to try to separate whether you are speaking northern or southern. It would have been much better to concentrate on one at a time.I think this could be a good program with better editing - perhaps they will update."
2,"Unpleasant ""pirate"" sound","I loved the Met broadcast of Fedora with Domingo and Scotto in the lead roles, which I have listened/watched over and over on TV via DVD. I like the music in this opera so much I decided to invest in a CD of Fedora that I could listen to while sitting at my computer. From the first few notes, I found the sound of the orchestra playing the overture appallingly bad. But I wanted to cover my ears when Renato Tebaldi started singing.... and I could go on.....Wish I had taken the time to read the other review which mentioned this is a pirate recording. Ugh. I must be completely spoiled by studio recordings. Too bad my CD player doesn't play DVDs..........."
3,part of the series,"excellent for quick referral if you are looking for quotes from the series, redundant if notdesk companion for quotes in cards"
2,Book Condition,Although it was stated to be in excellent condition - the spine was missing about 1/2 inch of the binding and there were black marks on the outside edge of the pages. Inside was fine. Falsely led to believe outside condition was better.
1,"Disappointing, at best","I have been a Mitford fan for a long time. I read the first four books in the series, and anxiously awaited the next visit with all of my favorite characters in Mitford. I have been disappointed in the last three books, and I hate this! Patches of Godlight did have some of my favorite quotes from the first books, but after several pages, it seemed to be the same thing, over and over. The 'coffee stains' in the book were not in color, which would have made the book more like Father Tim's journal. And crumbs of the famous Orange Marmalade cake might have perked it up also. I thought the book, without the dust jacket, was very nice. I am glad I was lucky enough to find this book for a very nominal price- I personally would not have spent the retail price for this one. I am hoping Karon's next book will be more like the original Mitford books."
1,not worth the money,"I flipped through this book at Borders and put it back on the shelf! Jan Karon and her publisher should spend more time working on an additional classic Mitford book and less time simply trying to make a quick buck. This book, together with her last ""Mitford"" book (what a dissapointment THAT was!)seems to tell us that the publisher wants to capitalize on the success of the Mitford series, rather than focus on the integrity of the story and Ms. Karon's writing. Some of the quotes are nice but most are sappy - you can find better ones in the first 4 books themselves - so, save your money and buy something really worth reading."
4,Not for me,"My grandma loves this author and wanted to whole series - or everything that she wrote, which ever came first."
4,Little Nuggets of Sunshine,"I make it a point to re-read all the Mitford books once every two years at least. It gives me a boost like nothing else. Other reviewers have complained of Karon's slow pace, but I find the atmosphere and the characters delightful. There really are people like those in Mitford, with silly quirks and deep kindness. Lest someone mistake the place for Mayberry, however, there are moments of intense passion and fear that require courage and faith. I only wish there were more literary towns like Mitford to visit.Patches of Godlight would be perfect as a bedside companion, to dip in and enjoy the wonderful little vignettes and quotes. I have bought several copies as gifts."
4,A Delightful Book,"Unfortunately it arrived too late for my original purpose i.e. to look for some quotes for a book club meeting, but it is a delightful book and I know I shall enjoy browsing through it again and again."
2,Insufficient information,Impossible to rate it or even understand it. Lack of information.Potential buyer needs to know: is it 2-wire or 4-wire installation?Does it contain rate-of-rise sensor? (what temperature?) or fixed (what temperature?)
1,Sad sad sad,That this previously progressive and interesting band would try to artificially cram themselves into an 80's pop pigeonhole is just sad. Sorry fans....this disc is awful.
2,For Die-Hards Only.,"With the so called ""progressive rock"" genre pretty much dead and buried by new wave punk Renaissance entered the 80's firmly abandoning the grand epics and sweeping statements that made their heyday for a straight ahead synth pop sound. The results are hardly compelling, but not quite as dreadful as you might think.""Camera, Camera"" contains more than its share of filler, but also contains some genuinely catchy pop moments such as the shoulda been a big hit single ""Bonjour Swansong.""But on the whole this is not an impressive chapter in the band's career. Fans of their earliler work will not be impressed, and synthpop fans aren't overtaking by nostalgia are more likely to seek out examples of the style that were actual hits.In short, for the most dedicated and devoted of Renaissance fans only."
3,Limitations of the Medium,"It's a wonderful trip through the fantasy world of 1939. It's faded, though.The reproductions available limit the viewability of the photos here. Everything is pastellish; you cannot believe that this was how Dali really made this exhibition. He was fond of splashy, bright color; the photography in this book looks very washed out.That said, though, the reader is amazed to learn what 1939 viewers would tolerate by way of ""explicit"" sexuality. You have nude women in provocative positions to be viewed by the general public. How did this make it through pre-war censorship? Most likely because it was ART.You won't seem images like this anywhere else. It is wonderful stuff, and a must for Dali fans."
3,rocky and bullwinkle short version,great compilation for those wanting only the bullwinkle storyline.personally I missed the little shorts in between such as fractured fairytales and mr peabody. these are cut out of the episodes here!!!
5,Great Memory,I am not a serious collector. I just bought the video to share a childhood memory with my children. We really enjoyed the videos. Would recommend to share with our babies who are accustomed to such a different form of animation.
3,Where is the Complete season 4? Season 5?,"Classic Media does it to us again. Screwing the fans over, refusing to release season 4 or 5. Making us wait 1 whole year between season 1, season 2, and season 3. Fans, show your support for releasing the whole season, and avoid these ""Best of"" dvd's, until they wise up and give us what we want. The original TV, uncut, broadcasts of Seasons 4 and 5! on DVD glory! It's not like anyone will broadcast R & B anymore, when's the last time YOU saw it? on any channel? We need seasons 4 & 5! Oh, and Baywatch: Hawaii too! :)"
1,Terrible recording &#65533; cough!,"The music, performers, delivery, and presentation (I assume) are wonderful but unfortunately, the recording is horrible - even for 1966. It sounds like there was one microphone for this recording, and that is was far removed from the stage. There are the additional annoyances of multiple microphone taps and the incredibly annoying incessant cougher in the later acts. Waste of money unless you want an example of a great Opera very poorly recorded."
5,Napoleon - From Tolsit to Waterloo,"Excellent book by the authoritative historian of this period, Georges Lefevbre. Condition of book excellent."
3,From lucid to ludicrous and little in-between,"Mr. Staguhn's writing is in turns dry detail and conspiratorial conjecture. Reading the book, I felt as if some revelation was imminent. I plowed through the tedium toward ... no grand revelation. In the end I realized I had encountered many small discoveries instead. While ideas in ""God's Laughter"" are original, if at all, only as a collection, they make fertile material for contemplation. This is a book not enjoy reading but to enjoy having read."
4,"You have to read ""Blue Rose"" first...","Start out by reading Straub's short story, ""Blue Rose,"" first. It introduces the character of Harry ""Beans"" Beevers when he was a child. Then read ""Koko"" to see Beevers again and to meet Tim Underhill. After that, meet Tom Pasmore in ""Mystery,"" then read ""The Throat."" I love when authors can bring characters back in books; it really gives them (the characters) a new depth. ""The Throat"" is a great book, although it's hard to get into (but that seems to be a characteristic of Straub's style). By the way, read ""If You Could See Me Now."" That's a good one,too."
4,Deep Throat,"Straub's mammoth story of the Blue Rose murders is finally brought to fruition in this lengthy, but ultimately satisfying, thriller.We are reintroduced to Tim Underhill from ""Koko"" and Tom Pasmore from ""Mystery."" These two heroes are deeply embroiled in discovering the identity of the mysterious Blue Rose murderer who struck in 1950 and now looks like he/she is back in 1989 or so.The identity of this serial killer is toyed with convincingly in this story, and the inclusion of the John Ransom character is an intriguing, if somewhat, frustrating red herring.Straub's writing is strong in this one, and he makes up for some of the indulgences he forced on us in ""Mystery"" and ""Koko."" Overall, a worthwhile trilogy, but be prepared to spend a lot of time with them."
2,The Throat by Peter Straub,"DON'T LISTEN TO THESE OTHER REVIEWS. Because I did. After achingly sitting through ""Koko"" and ""Mystery,"" I questioned whether I should read The Throat. I looked it up on here, and it got good reviews. Definitely not worth the time. I'm at the point where I've given this author all I can, and I might give up on him. Straub weaves too much events, information, and characters for you to even care about what's going on. The ""killer"" could be anyone in the story, or perhaps, how's this: nobody in the story. Booooring... and this was the LONGEST of the trilogy. Most of the action happens ""off-screen"" so to say, and your entire time reading is spent trying to piece informatin together. Try an author like Stephen King or Dean Koontz, who can be intellectual but also ENTERTAIN. The only book I've read by Straub so far that was bearable was the one he wrote with Stephen King.. ""The Talisman."" (a great book--one of the best)"
2,What the...?,"I read Mystery and thought, ""how disappointing"", because I've read Straub before and was impressed by his wordplay. I then discovered that it was part of a trilogy and started scouting my library. I haven't read Koko (the first book) yet, but managed to get The Throat, the final book of the series.It's awful.Fifty pages into it, I was tempted to get out a pad and pen and start again, making notes of all the characters and trying to figure out who the narrator actually was in the context of the events in Mystery, to which he kept referring. The narrator claims to be the author of the events in Mystery, but had written it as fiction - he then goes on to give an account of being hit by a car (as did the major character in Mystery), but under COMPLETELY different circumstances than in the first book and... I give up. It was just far too convoluted for enjoyment."
1,The agony...,"I endured as I tried to give this book a ""fair shake"". I only made it to page 80 and had to stop. For me the book was a bit dis-jointed and I found the author's style not to my liking. Perhaps, I will try to give it a second chance some other time but for now, I am moving on to folks like Koontz and Saul whose style, in my opinion, exceed that of this author."
3,The End of a Decent Trilogy,"I read both ""KOKO"" & ""MYSTERY"" a few years back and never got around to ""THE THROAT"" until just recently, mostly because ""MYSTERY"" was some-what of a chore to finish. Nevertheless, I was glad to have the return of Tim Underhill and Tom Passmore (quite possibly the best amatuer detective duo of our time). Much like Hitchcock, Straub's raw talent for creating elaborate thrillers with completely plausible twist endings is incredible. What seperates the author, however, is his meandering prose which is filled with enough detail to possibly fill another novel. I sometimes found myself a little bored with a few of the chapters (more specifically, the excerpts from a fictional Vietnam War novel about Franklin Bachelor) but ultimately enjoyed the story as a whole. My only major disappointment is knowing that ""THE THROAT"" marks the end of a good series."
5,book 3,"In my opinion the Blue Rose Murder books, Mystery & Throat were PERFECT. (Koko, the first in the series, I didn't like) I enjoyed every minute spent with these two books tho. Just thinking back on them makes me happy! Tom Pasmore and his real father are beautiful characters, Tim Underhill is righton. A Fabulous story that takes you to many places in many times. It flows smooth & easy, fast & excitingMystery & Throat = perfection.Koko = illogical."
4,Great book,This was a great book. It is not slow moving like the one before it. If you made it past Mystery then read and enjoy!
4,"Read it last, still liked it","Well, I didn't know that this book was the third part in a trilogy- although i was a bit confused in the beginning, as it felt like I was missing something. But in all honestly it's a good strong stand alone book. I really didn't have to know anything about the history of the characters or the murders in the two books that came before. This one was really good. It took awhile to get into it ( and that's where reading the other two might have helped) but I did like the characters and it left me wanting to know more about Tim Underhill. Not sure I'll go back to the beginning now that I know how this ends, but I do like the characters a lot and the writing has depth so I probably will just for the experience."
3,Good for completing a collection,"I greatly admire Floyd Cramer's music and ordered this on a whim based on one song I heard on Pandora.com. This was the album they used.Of my Floyd Cramer albums, this is my least favorite. The CD quality is just fine, nothing wrong with the media, packaging, etc. it is just that the mix of songs really don't appeal to me. If I'd heard the whole CD first, I'd never have ordered this one.However, this is a personal opinion. Your tastes may and probably will differ from mine. You may love the album. So play the samples before purchasing as this isn't really his normal genre i.e. not very Country."
3,live and learn,Is what it is: A cheaply made come-along that does what you expect as long as you don't expect too much. My mistake for getting the stretchy rope version instead of cable. Probably get rid of it on CList. Extra half star for prompt delivery.
3,Good for 1000 pounds,"Purchased this to move rocks in my yard. The rating of 3/4 ton is tight-don't expect any more. As you put more load on the puller, the rope drops into the grooved pulley tightening it's grip. That part is great--everything is working.The problem is as approaching 3/4 ton, the rope tightens too much, the rope narrows and begins slipping in the pulley. Called the factory, there is no fix and their customer service is a joke. I feel I should be able to get the full 1500 lbs but that is not going to happen with this puller. Better customer service could direct me to better rope--hemp versus nylon, etc. Disappointed with this product.The bottom of the puller has a bolt up area that I found malfunctioning. Especially when starting the pull, the rope tends to slip off the bottom of the puller, bunch up and seize. If the area was narrower, everything would work a lot better."
5,Live saver!,"I work for the local power company and we use these hoist all of the time. Very handy for putting up wire after a storm. Great for giving a tree a little help when cutting. We take one along almost every time we patrol line in the back country on a snowmobile. (Providing you can find a tree or something else to hook on, to pull yourself out.) Just make sure you have realistic expectations, your not going to pull a car out with this thing. Well worth the money, we have one on almost every truck at our company."
1,Doggerel,"This garbage is like Sharon Olds on crack. Cliches, cliches, cliches... poorly broken! Self-pity! Purile! Don't waste your time!"
5,The best band I've heard in awhile.,"Frenzal Rhomb is becoming one of my favorite bands. I saw them for the first time at Warped 98 and since then I have been a loyal fan. Not only are their albums good, they are some of the best performers I've seen. If they come to a town near you... GO SEE THEM!"
5,frenzal go off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well frenzal rhomb have to be the best punk band ever the songs are fast and if u love headbanging go for this one. U have to check out the lyrics of some of these songs they are absolutely hilarious. ""i believe the words of your best friend how he likened u to a steaming turd, and when he said that he wished that u were dead it was the most inntelligent thing anyones ever said"" ""i could take a cash machine and run down the street, thats if i had some muscles and was quick on my feet"" and more a must buy"
5,great book,"This book was a gift and an unexpected plaesure. I read a little bit each day, as it is set up like a calendar. It was so much fun to read about my state each day and to have something unusual, fun or sad to share with colleagues. the reading is easy but the content makes you think. I bought a copy and donated to my son's elementary school...but they already HAD one. Great book."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in the layout of this book because there seemed to be such a confusing way of hearing the historical accounts out of chronological order. I would not recommend this book to any serious history student.
2,A Disappointment,"Although it contains some little known tidbits, much of this book covers crimes and events depicting the most negative aspects of Tennessee history. Jones has added his own contemporary judgments to many of these items instead of presenting the information objectively. The book also contains numerous contradictions. For example, in one entry he claims the KKK was founded in Nashville in 1867; in another he claims the KKK was founded in Pulaski in 1866. I would certainly not give this book to someone from another state. A far more positive and inspirational gift would be Mountain Hands by Sam Venable."
4,Another Opera d'Oro bargain,"No, it's not THE ""Manon"" to own but indispensable as an adjunct to a wholly authentic, French, complete version such as the more recent, very successful Alagna/Gheorghiu/Pappano recording with a mostly French supporting cast.This one is in Italian - none the worse for that, just different - and loses the first scene of Act 3 - fairly standard practice in 1969. The animal passion brought to the singing by Pavarotti and Freni is perhaps the result of their singing in their native language; sung like this the opera is less charming and precious, more gutsy and Puccini-esque; Italianate, not Gallic. Panerai is in fine voice and very characterful, the supporting cast adequate. the sound is quite good - only occasionally a bit congested - and the audience very well behaved, saving their raucous appreciation for appropriate moments. The two principals are in unbelievably fresh voice - just occasionally Freni scoops a bit, but they both sing tenderly as well as passionately."
3,There's only reason to buy this...,"I bought this just for the eleven minute version of the ""Main Event. as well as for the ballad version. Both are excellent. The other tracks are mainly filler. Skip it otherwise."
5,Truly inspirational!,"Ray Carney's ""Cassavetes on Cassavetes"" is a wonderful introduction to Cassavetes' work. I found it to be a great read - amazingly free of academic jargon or fancy terminology. It was hard to put down! And with incredible photos of the wild-man at work. A must for every fan of indie film as well as aspiring directors and artists - and also for students of life! If you want to know even more, I'd also recommend Ray Carney's massive web site devoted to Cassavetes and indie film. Any search engine will take you there. It has wonderful behind-the-scenes information about the making of Cassavetes' work. If you want a volume to provide ongoing daily inspiration and encouragement regarding the artistic process, buy this book. It is a book you will go back to again and again and again..."
3,Entertaining WWII film set in German-occupied Holland let down by cartoonish treatment and plot inconsistencies,"This well-produced Dutch film traces the experiences of a young Dutch-Jewish woman in German-occupied Holland in the final stages of WWII. With Paul Verhoeven at the helm you know you are there are going to be some unusual touches and fans will not be disappointed - the film has fetishistic love scenes, cartoonish action, and numerous plot inconsistencies and ambiguities. Although long the film is never boring. The acting is excellent, particulary by the leads Carice van Houten and Sebastian Koch. What really detracts from the impact of this film is an illogical plot development surrounding Koch's character at the end of the film from which is never quite recovers. Nevertheless this film provides yet another interesting perspective on WWII.As usual Verhoeven provides a tremendously frank and entertaining ""director's commentary""."
5,Great movie - sad tale,"This tale involves a jewish woman who is running from the Nazis. While she is running, we find that she joins the resistance and falls in love with a german officer. So, she is set on a roller coaster life story, one that almost ends tragically, Instead, it only ends badly for her in the end because she stills lives. She just does not live like she had hoped. The acting is great, the story is good, and shot very well. Very entertaining and very moving. Get it and watch."
5,Black Book,I love this movie! Excellent plot - High production values!The only thing I didn't like (and I may have to adjust my TV)was that the english subtitles are low on the screen and some were cut off.I got involved in the movie and didn't want to start making adjustments.I'm sure I'll watch it again and will make adjustments then.Highly recommended!
5,A best-ever,"The absolute best film on WWII I have ever seen, and I have seen about all of the good ones. There is a building tension, several levels of plots and sub-plots, masterful acting and believable characters. In this genre, this is a must see."
4,Just beautiful movie,It's a relief to see such well-made movies and such great performances without the stereotype American approach. I was absorbed into the movie from start to finish.
5,Happy buyer!,"This was a gift for Christmas. I only buy gifts I like myself. This movie I got from The Netherlands, in Dutch. I was impressed with the story.The movie came in time, good packaged, like the seller told me. I can recommend the movie and the seller."
5,WORLD WAR II MOVIES,"Mesmerizing,enthalling movie. Great photography. Might even call it a ""CHICK FLICK"". Guess you either love or hate this one. Either way not boring way to spen your time!"
1,A Great Movie Ruined,"I just bought this movie for my Dad for Father's Day. He's Dutch, Mom is American, and I thought they both could enjoy watching the movie together.It turns out that the subtitles ran off the bottom of the screen, so my Dad had to interpret the whole movie.What a shame. I thought I hit a home run with this present, but I struck out!"
3,Crass war,"Another breathtaking exercise in vulgarity from Euro-trash schlockmeister Vorhoeven. Even the furnishings appear to be dripping in slime. Lovers of high camp should follow the chocky bar as it will have special significance in one of many outrageous plot twists. Any film that makes ""The Boys From Brazil"" look tasteful must have something going for it."
5,Black Book,"Since I was born in The Netherlands, this movie hits home. Fantastic. Excitement from beginning to end. Well played by the actors."
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A red-blooded adventure of a war movie, Black Book is consistently enthralling for the entirety of its 140 minute running length; though the bookending sequences feel unnecessary and the screenplay is not exactly subtle, this is a quite a little gem from Paul Verhoven."
2,"Too much happening on the surface, not enough going on underneath","Director Paul Verhoeven may have ""gone back to his roots"" with this foreign language production about the Dutch resistance during WWII, but he took a lot of bad Hollywood habits with him. Most egregious among them is the overly busy plot, rushing from incident to incident and thrill to thrill, full of coincidence and contrivance. The film never seems to be willing to slow down enough for us to really spend some time with these characters to fully appreciate their dilemma; Verhoeven and his screenwriters seem too impatient to get to the next plot twist. The cast is superb, but it is difficult to care very much about what happens to the people in this story."
4,Good WW2 Thriller,"This was quite an interesting and suspenseful WW2 drama. Set in Nazi-occupied Holland, the film follows Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten), a Dutch Jew in hiding, as she becomes involved in the Dutch resistance, eventually infiltrating the local Gestapo headquarters by seducing it's Captain, Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch). What follows is a tumultuous odyssey with lots of betrayal, sex, violence, despair, humor, and even love where you would least expect it. Good guys turn into bad guys and vice versa.Personally, I'm all about graphic (female) nudity so that didn't bother me in the least, although I didn't need to see that much of Franken! Overall, I thought the film was very good although it seemed a bit scattered, and there were a few aspects that seemed a bit stereotypical and/or implausible. These are just minor criticisms though, in an otherwise enjoyable and compelling film. Four stars.Oh and I almost forgot, Carice van Houten....Yikes! If only I wasn't married my love."
3,The Most Disturbing Graphic Holocaust Movie Ever.,I struggled with this review. I know the Holocaust was as bad as this movie portrays. I have watched most movies out there on WWII. The acting was very good and the plot very complex. The scene everyone is upset about with the hair coloring did not bother me so much as a Jewish woman whould have to do what she did to pass as Arian.It is just very brutal/sexual. So much shooting and blood and the final horrid thing where the hero is stripped and waste is poured over her was just too much for me to stand.So I say it is a 5 star as far as qualaity and truth. But how it leaves you feeling is a 1 so I settled on 3.If you cannot handle total violence then choose one of the many other great Holocaust movies to learn more. This will leave you very upset and traumatized.
3,Black Book Not Up to Snuff,A good yarn for those who want to see a bit about WW2 resistance efforts in Holland. Cinematography is high quality but the story is over-acted. Not as good as Soldier of Orange made in 1977 and still the standard bearer of good WW2 films made in Holland for audiences beyond its borders.
3,Showgirl,"Now that he's lost both his DPs (Jan & Jost) and composers (Basil & Jerry), Verhoeven finds himself in a situation not unlike Hitchcock did from Torn Curtain onwards. Choreographed camera-moves and modernist soundscapes make way for academic multi-camera and a mushy score, yet the re-teaming with scriptwriter Soeteman packs some punch and make for an engaging plot, carried along by a stellar cast. Even a minor Verhoeven pic is still fascinating to watch and I had to devour this DVD complete with its trademark commentary."
3,"High production values, good story, but two problems...","There are two things about Black Book that made me wish I had not spent the time watching it. Number one, the movie starts out several years after the main story. Because of this, we already know the ultimate outcome for the main character, and the suspense of all the travails of that character is blunted.Number two, the main character's situation and her trials are sympathetic. But the character is played so cool (not completely cold, but definitely cool) emotionally that I did not buy it. She gets in some incredibly tight spots and doesn't really show the tension and strain to make it believable. Not for me, at least. Maybe some people like that kind of a heroine, but honestly Lara Croft shows more humanity sometimes than this gal.These are two serious flaws. They didn't ruin the movie, but made it much less enjoyable."
5,A trenchant analysis of what's wrong with today's America.,"Neely brings an informed and interesting perspective to problems of illegitimacy, crime, and welfare dependency. This book deserves to be read by everyone interested in really understanding these problems beyond the sound-bite level."
3,a gram of prevention,"Written some time ago, but relevant today. What to do with the welfare state? A call for the diffusion of contraception, so that abortion as an issue may return to its former status. Well-documented facts in a book which reads like a novel."
3,"Tebaldi is brilliant, but the recording is of poor quality.","This live recording from 1952 has a wonderful Tebaldi in the role of Violetta. The sound quality is poor, however. The orchestra sounds muffled and the male voices sound distorted. Tebaldi somehow makes it through the poor recording and shines. I found myself wishing for a better recording of this wonderful performance. It was like watching an old black and white movie whose sound track has worn with time. One can only imagine how glorious it was in its prime. If it were a better recording, I would have given it 5 stars."
3,Cute for the little kids,"I had no problem finding the on/off switch and volume control on the bottom.My 6 year old is too old for this toy,and too old for the Wiggles now,but the younger ones that know all the words to the songs liked it alot,and the big buttons were easy for them to work.The 5 year old that knows piano keys was happy that she could play ""Yankee Doodle"" on it.Most of the Wiggles toys were overpriced and hard to find to start with,but if you saw one at a yard sale or on sale,would be worth it for the little ones."
4,Christmas Gift,"My 23-month old son received this toy for Christmas and it was one of his favorites. He played with it off and on for hours. Woke up this morning and ran right to it. It isn't very educational but the fact that he recognizes the songs from the show makes it more fun. It's not too bulky so it's something we can take in the car. Overall, we love it and would recommend it to any Wiggles fan ;-)"
2,Ours Broke Easily,"My daughter got this for Christmas this year and almost immediately pulled off the top half of the Greg character on the keyboard. In their defense, none of the other characters have come off so we will try to return this in case it was an isolated incident. Other than that, she seems to like it. She also received the accordian and LOVES it so I would recommend that over the keyboard."
4,"Great, but no volume selector.","If your child likes the Wiggles like my 2 year-old does, then she'll love this keyboard. Except that there is no volume button, which I consider rude to the parents. :("
5,The Bromberg album to own,"Speaking as a devoted Bromberg follower, this is the best album to own. It's also the best album to give someone you are trying to interest in David. Don't Put That Thing On Me is a great song to listen to as you vacuum - don't ask - just pop on the headset and turn it up. Its an album to listen to on a hot afternoon with a cold beer, or to get up and waltz with your honey on a winter evening. Or you could waltz with your cold beer and listen with your honey, it's an easy album."
1,Den...duh-den...den-den duh-den.OOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMM,"That's it. If you can read my title, you can avoid wasting an hour and your money. I sat around for an hour waiting for something...anything...to happen, but it's the same thing for an hour straight. I suppose it might be interesting if you're tripping balls because the drugs can create their own rhythms, but for a normal human being, it's the worst CD I ever spend money on."
2,"Relaxing, but...","I am glad I got this used for cheap. Given how much I enjoy Rusted Root (and Donovan's drumming is obviously the backbone of that whole experience), I had high hopes for some interesting experimental material on this album. Boy was I disappointed to find that it is merely a slow build-up to a short loop that is repeated for an hour. Not that that loop isn't soothing to listen to, but it's basically guitar strings being struck with drumsticks. Not recommended except purely as background noise."
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed when I received this product. I assumed it was a commercially made DVD but instead it was something recorded off television and burnt onto a DVD rom. There was no proper menu just the title. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the taped show itself was very enjoyable but I don't think it's something that should be bought on Amazon. Cheers Daryl Alexander
1,Poor Picture Qualitity,Overall this is poor quality film. I have seen many vintage movies but this is the worst. Not worth of seeing this movie
2,Too Small...,"This organizers are way smaller than they appear in the advertisement and thus don't hold much cord. And they really are only good to hold very flexible cord (like that on a computer mouse or keyboard). For stiffer cords (like lamp electric cords), they simply don't do the job."
3,Not for all Cords,"They work okay for smaller cords. They definitely do not work for bigger cords, like printer cables, etc."
3,"Great, but small","The product itself is great, good quality materials and they do the work. Very good for headphones, mouse cord, short cable speakers, etc. The diameter is about the size of a thumb.Won't work if you're looking for something to organize all those cables behind your TV, Bluray, gaming console, etc."
1,Poor Quality & not very useful,I found the cord organizers to be of low quality and not able to contain cords very well. not worth the money at all.
2,cable cord organizer,"i am not at all happy with these devices. they are too small and too flimsy and they really do not work as described. they are heavy for the job they are supposed to do. on electronics and especially ones with break-away connections, they are not at all satisfactory. to be quite honest, a rubber band works better."
1,These are Rubber not silicone,"While this product does work it is not silicon or another supple plastic; that being said neither is it still they work but are a bit wonky and both halves do swivel away from each other (the tipped areas dont line up unless you cause them to),not the best value but ok."
2,"below average quality, and small","These are only good for very small and fairly short cords. Upon arrival, one was already broken (the white plastic that holds the two sides together was cracked). They don't hold much, and the shells are not very sturdy. Unimpressed. I do, however, recommendGE 22548 CableNeat Clam Ball-Shaped Rubber Organizer- much sturdier, hold larger/longer cords, larger, and overall better product."
2,Not very useful product.,The rubber flaps are soft and do not hold the wires tightly. The coiled wires do get loose.Cable ties / Velcro based ties in my opinion work better then this product.
2,Fat Tuesday - 'Everybody's Got One' (Columbia),"From what I could find,'Everybody's...' was the Minneapolis band's second and final CD.Didn't do much for me.Best described as heavy pop.There are however a couple of tunes that did manage to keep me awake through the disc's duration.Those being ""High And Low"",""#20""(maybe the disc's best track)and ""Coming Down"".I guess they all can't be great or even good for that matter."
3,"Burning like a tire, swinging from a tree","To give this CD one out of five is criminal. As your mother would say: Do not trust people who buy a CD just because it is cheap! It includes a true classic, ""Stray dog"", one of the coolest songs ever made. It is true that Sichran' s voice is a bit weak and nasal, but it works(and that is enough!), and he sure barks like a dog on this track. One for the compilations, the song is so cool it could probably smoke cigarettes underwater! The other standout track is ""Burning like a tire, swinging from a tree"". I have seen some pretty fine women shake their booty to this song on the dancefloor. If Bobby was faking it, they wouldn' t be shaking it!I am happy to see that other people has reviewed this criminally overlooked album, and given it 5 stars, because I only gave it three, and that was one star short.Yours trulyDr. Louis Cochs"
3,"Velocity Has Some Real ""Impact""","This unknown surprise actually delivers some good old fashioned metal/rock that I thought to be pretty much dead since around 1990. David Victor's efforts on this debut from Velocity helped make this a worthwhile buy for me.David Victor's lead vocals are good and his guitar work is solid. There's some hard at-ya stuff with You Don't Amaze Me Anymore, Love Is Dangerous and One Minute to Midnight. There's also some good melodic stuff with Janine, Julia Ann and my favorite track on the album, More Than Tonight. The rest of the tracks are pretty decent."
5,"Impact, what a fitting name for the year's best release.","Impact is one of the best recordings, not only in the last year, but ever. If you are looking for a rock and roll sensation, not an alternative wuss boy sound, but a down right rock your ass off, good time, feel good recording, this is it! Definately worth twice the money you would pay to buy it."
3,invicta watches,Is a excellent watch and beautiful but you have in your description errors when is it automatic or battery
4,language barrier,"Having lived in county Cork for several years, I didn't have too much trouble with the authentic/real Irish speech. I don't think, however, that many customers are going to enjoy the movie due to the dialogue and speech patterns common to,particularly, the Cork area. Good story line, and very consistent with the history of that time. A better movie for the american audience is the one about 'the big fella' Collins, with Liam Neeson."
1,Barely enjoyable,"An hour into it, I was barely maintaining enough interest to continue watching this movie when I distinctly heard the director yell ""Cut!"" at the end of a scene. I did a rewind a few times to confirm what I heard. How could you leave this in your movie?!"
4,Best IRA Film,This is the best film I have ever seen dealing with the Irish rebellion in the 1920's. Well cast and well presented with the facts pretty well in line with what I have read about this period of Irish history.
5,The Wind that Shakes the Barley,"Excellent movie on the Irish Civil War, though very violent there is very little blood shown. The director concentrated on the acting and the scenery and not on the latest over the top special effects."
3,Violent Movie about IRA,"This movie needs english subtitles. The accents were so strong and mumbled. The movie was rather violent, so you need a strong stomach to watch this one. I was not able to finish the movie, so intend to watch again and perhaps look for a sub title function."
5,Think of Taliban,"This does present a confusing view of another time. For those not familiar with the Irish struggle for freedom, and who need a contemporary reference -- consider the British as the Taliban. They had no financial, or strategic, need for Ireland -- the dominance was cultural - or more precisely - religious. Those strange British troops in ""Black and Tan"" were not real British Army, but released criminals, thugs, and mercenaries. The Irish, for their part, were not a cohesive historic political entity, but a people desperate for freedom, and arguing among themselves -- somewhat like the Afgans who know they want freedom but have not yet had a chance to define it. The film is brilliant. The topic is tragic."
4,the wind that shakes the barley,"Well costructed with fine acting . Could have benefited from more editing, a little too long"
2,Art or propaganda?,Paul Laverty has produced a sensitive script about the relationship between two brothers who end up on different sides of the civil conflict in Ireland during the struggle for independence in the early 1920s. Unfortunately director Ken Loach has taken such an extreme pro-communist position (very few Irish at the time were communists) that the whole story becomes distorted into propaganda. A very sad waste of a good film. Extremely violent.
1,Poor quality video,We tried to stream this video to our TV via ps3. It usually works very well. The first three times we tried it wouldn't even play. When it finally did play the poor quality of the video was so annoying we finally just gave up.
1,Sent in European PAL format. Can't watch.,"I got this through an Amazon approved seller, Movie Mars. It doesn't play. A message shows up on my screen that I am unauthorized to watch this video and to consult the owner's manual. (The same message also shows up on another movie from Movie Mars, Apt Pupil.) I checked the label on the discs and the label reads that it is PAL (European) format. This won't play on an American DVD player. I contacted Movie Mars, the approved seller. They told me it won't play because I purchased it as ""Region 2"". I can't find anything in their description about PAL format, or Region 2. They will refund my money providing I pay the return postage!! I'm done with Movie Mars and am extremely disappointed in Amazon."
4,Not for every citizen of the world.,"Great film, a piece of Irish history covering part of the critical years of struggle for independence from the U.K. The absence of well-known movie stars makes it less attractive to the usual moviegoer. Besides, ignorance of European History is certainly a shortcoming as few people in the world know that the British and the Irish are different ethnic groups and that the U.K. dominated Ireland for centuries and did its best to destroy its culture. If you are of Irish stock, you'll probably rate it 10/10. Myself, 8/10."
1,The Wind That Shakes the Barley,I couldn't get past the beginning of this show. A lot of swearing and violence. I got to a torture scene and couldn't watch anymore.
1,The Wind That Shakes the Barley,"The movie might have been better if the quality of the sound track wasn't so difficult to hear. The volume fluctuates, the Irish accents are difficult to understand, and then the movie drags.I should have rented it. I don't want it in my collection taking up space when I will never want to listen to it again."
1,Too violent for me to watch,I only got about twenty minutes into it and the violence was too much for me.
5,Excellent portayal of Irish Revolution,Should be mandatory viewing of anyone not familiar with the early 1900s suppression of the Irish and their struggle against the tyranny of England complete with Black and Tan brutality and torture of Irish prisoner. Also sadly portrays the strife and civil war among the Irish when partition of Ireland was agreed upon with the British by the Free State Irish resulting in Irish men and women killing each other as the Republicans struggled against the partition agreement.
5,The saddest story of all,"This is a stunning film. It makes real all that you know about the fight for Ireland's freedom. The beauty of the film is considerable, but not so grand that it overtakes the story. I haven't the words to describe it..."
1,PU,"PU says it all. The acting is wooden and Fairbanks sounds like a loon with his constant laughter. Pickford is way over-dramatic. She sounds like a New York dance hall girlThe supporting cast is inadaquate, the direction spotty.This comedy (?) is pretty bad even by 1929 standards."
5,A great Madama Butterfly,"Years ago, I bought this recording by Victoria de los Angeles because it was on a budget label. That is how I came to discover this great diva and her sterling performance. Shortly thereafter, I attended a performance of this opera at the Met featuring a young Leona Mitchell. I need only relate this incedent to tell you how great this recording is. After the performance I gained entry to to Mitchell's dressing room. Tony Randall was just leaving, having profusely congratulated Mitchell (am I name dropping enough?). Anyway, I went up to Mitchell and told her that I thought her performance was even greater than de los Angeles. She looked at me really appreciative of such a comparison. She said to me' ""really?"" The esteem in which a great young diva held de los Angeles as Butterfly is all the review this cd needs. This is a wonderful bargain cd."
2,Fair shower radio,"Works ok. I just use it to listen to news radio--it can be hard to precisely tune am stations. I used to have the exact same one, but this time around, it seems cheaper in quality.After I bought it, I saw it cheaper at Bed Bath & Beyond (which didn't originally have it)."
1,"VERY BAD SOUND, WARNING","THE SOUND IS VERY POOR. I HAVE THIS RECORDING AND I AM RETURNING IT. LIVE RECORDINGS HAVE COUGHING AND OTHER NOISES. THE ONLY GOOD LIVE RECORDING IS THE BEATLES.IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THIS OPERA, LOOK ELSEWHERE."
1,This is the kind of reviews that mads Sutherland,"Callas made these remarks. Sutherland fans are not responsible. But if you continue the following remarks, I cut and paste it. there will be many more negative. Callas and Sutherland can afford it. they are cosider the greatest singers of the century, read you schwann catalog. Sills can't. If I were you, shut up, and stop posting neg remarks for two weeks and it will be over. Unfortunately slow in posting these remarks, and Sutherland fans have stopped making negative for weeks, but you sills and callas continue. Stop now, you can't compete. Sutherland and Callas are far more popular than Sills. That's the truth."
5,4 reasons to get this,"1) Of course, for Beverly Sills' totally rockin' Marie! NO ONE (I repeat: NO ONE) can sing this better and funnier than she can. Coloratura passages are super duper fast, and high notes are impeccable!!! This is 1969, which finds Beverly in extremely fresh voice, which can only mean furiously sung difficult coloratura of the highest order. And of course as far as characterization goes, Beverly was on fire doing this comic role. Comedy was very much her sort of thing, and she never failed to bring comical characters to life. This may be a live recording, but the sound is surprisingly good. Ever heard of something called ""sensory adaptation""? That helps too. This is undoubtedly the #1 Fille to get."
1,worst sound I've ever heard.,It may be a great performance. but I can't hear the soprano or the tenor. All I hear is coughing and footsteps. Sounds like it's recorded with a boombox.Avoid this one. The sound is the worst I've ever heard in a live recording.
1,"Not great, bad sound","First, the sound is like listening to mono radio in the 1940's. Then the static and tape noise. Very, very bad. If you like Sills , get the Roberto D.P.S. She is very shrill here. Next to the other singers, you is drown out."
5,Good Small Pump,"The design is nice and this thing is really small ~8"" long. I've used it on a 1.95"" mtn tire and a 135 PSI road tire, and it worked well both times. They were both presta valves, but I have switched it around to do schrader too. Even though the chamber is small, it moves a good amount of air. It does take a fair number of pumps to pressurize the tire, but about typical in my experience. Don't buy a pump like this for daily use, only emergencies. Get a good floor pump for home use. The handle can be turned to lock the pump closed which is a nice feature. The head also rotates to lock the pump onto the valve. Feels like it will be durable, but I haven't had it that long."
2,Information circa 1992: even the roads have moved!,"The material in the 2nd edition is from 1992, NOT 2000 as the Amazon page says. We recently moved to Southern California, bought the book on Amazon, then went to boulder at Hidden Valley Campground. I had trouble getting my bearings... Intersection Rock was in the wrong place... the roads have all moved in that area since the book was written. I met a local in the parking lot and asked him what was up. When he saw the book in my hand he asked if I bought it at the ranger station, then complained that it was still on their shelves given how out of date it is.I don't know if the publication date is a typo (maybe 2000 was the last reprint date?) but I'm not impressed with the book. Combine the lacking route descriptions (see other reviews) with 15 years since publication and you've got a pretty weak guide book. Spend your $33 on a better, more current book."
4,the original JTree guidebook,"This book was the basis for Jtree climbing knowledge for years...Now that Randy Vogel already has another guidebook out (which is really good by the way!) and is releasing another one this upcoming January (2008) this book may become out-dated, but still a really good tool if you lack the two new volumes."
4,"Missing details, but great guide","This is a very comprehensive guide to Joshua Tree for climbers. It is the book that we always take with us as the defintive reference. Generally, the information is accurate and the maps detailing which rock is which in various formations is quite good.However, there are several notable drawbacks to the book. First - the routes often have no description of them or any guidance as to the trad gear needed for a given route. Second, many of the routes for some areas do not appear in the pictures making route finding without a good desription, difficult. Third, descent information is often not found or has to be interpreted.It may sound like there are major faults with the book, but in reality it is a good book that is very useful. Just don't expect it to tell you everything you need to know about a given crag."
5,THE PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND,A LOOK INTO THE LIVES OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH A SYSTEM THEY BARELY UNDERSTOOD AT A TIME WHEN THE HOME FRONT PEOPLE WERE ALL BUT FORGOTTEN BY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
1,Uninspiring and Eventually Annoying,"Martial Solal is an excellent pianist, but this big-band album of Duke Ellington songs is utterly boring. Indeed, the final selection, a medley, turns into a contest of how many quotes can be made of different songs, connecting them by big-band cliches. If you are the kind of person whose mood is improved by hearing four bars of ""Sophisticated Lady"" followed by a tiny slice of ""Do Nothin Till You Hear From Me,"" then you will enjoy this cut. I found it most annoying.There is no reason to listen to this instead of a real Duke Ellington album, such as Far East Suite, or Early Recordings, or the Blanton-Webster Band. There you will not hear a single cliche, and the soloing will be much better as well. There is plenty of room for new approaches to the Ellington oeuvre, but this approach is not interesting."
5,What about Dave Specter's contribution here?,"Love Lurrie's guitar playing and singing, but Dave Specter adds something to this album that takes Lurrie up more than a notch. You say you haven't heard Dave Specter? Check out ANY of HIS albums (and all the albums he plays on as a sideman) and you won't go wrong. What a groove he gets going."
5,Excellent play table,"We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old and she loves it, she even convinces her 8 year old sister to play with her on it. The chalk board is great quality. She even likes to eat her meals there because it's the perfect size for her. Thanks so much!"
5,adorable desk!!!,"I LOVE this desk- just received it and put it together for my 2 year old son and I LOVE IT!!!! The colors and design is absolutely adorable, very easy to put together, very well made. It is multi-functional because it can be used flat as a desk or at an angle as an easel. I just have no complaints at all...I am so excited for my son to see it!!!!"
5,fantastic,bought this for my 2 year old - she loves it and her 3 yr old brother and 5 yr old sister love it too. Very sturdy and one of our best buys for the kids
4,"cool, older book","A fun book, straight from the 1950's, but some of the building ideas never change and retro is cool."
1,"The ""Nightmare"" before Birthday",At no fault of the Seller's this product is a piece of Junk!! It came in an unopened sealed package. I opened read the instructions and hooked it up to my computer. After being on charge for 8 hours it would not turn on or work at all. I put songs on it to test and no luck. This was meant to be a birthday present for my daughter who loves Jack from Nightmare Before Christmas. I had to go to Walmart and buy her something else. Piece of Junk!!!!!
1,Never rang true,"I started out with high expectations for this book, but after so many terrible things happened, it was just too much. I feel the book really lost credibility with the ""hog's head"" bit. Using the complete head of the hog for food was (and still is)normal -- any poor rural person would understand this -- the author apparently never heard of headcheese or jowl. The ending was just too trite. The book seemed to be a poorly written narrative about domestic violence without understanding the motivesof the characters."
1,Forget it!,"I bought one of these over 3 years ago. It lasted about one year and simply quit working. Could not find anyone to help find out what was wrong. Like a dummy, I bought another. It too, quit working about one year later. I would not recommend this to anyone. When I say quit, I mean quit. The batteries were still fine, they worked in other things, like flashlights, but the monitor simply did not function.Wristech Blood Pressure Monitor As Seen on Tv Wristech New and Improved Model. FDA Approved"
1,Arrived DOA,"This item is pure Junk. The one I bought would inflate for about 5 secs then quit and gave an error message. I returned it. I think I'm going to Boycott anything ""As Scene on TV."" Never had a good experience with any info-commercial product."
2,This book is a great idea in theory...,"I loved the idea of this book. I love TV and Owen is an outstanding TV writer (for a good sample, read his column on-line). The book has some interesting ideas, but the book gets dull. It breaks no new ground and doesn't shed light on others. I liked the fact that it wasn't steeped in the usual ""media criticism"", but there is no depth to much of the book. I think Owen will write a great book on TV one day...he just isn't there yet."
4,Good book. Read on kindle then purchased real book,"So I read this from the library on my Kindle last year. When up in SF I visited Mission Pie, and they'd made an apple pie with chili, which I remembered was a recipe from this book. So, I ordered the physical copy to have that recipe around."
4,Visions Lead To Further Reading,"In my Visions of Childhood class that I am currently taking at college, we were assigned Northern Borders. Given two weeks to read this, I found that I couldn't put it down and ultimately finished reading the material within two days! A must read for anyone who enjoys good fiction writing, without the complexities that many writers use as subterfuge for the story. Highly recommended for those in the class or not! Definetly looking forward to checking out more books my Mosher."
5,Those wonderful voices and that banjo of Carols,"First time I heard these girls, I was totally blown away. Their sound is so unique. What harmony! Could sit and listen to them forever and forever. That accordion is haunting. And Carol with that clawhammer banjo and that voice of hers! Wow. These girls are all truly truly talented. And they are super human beings. I have just about worn out this CD. I have an autographed 8 X 10 picture of them hanging in a place of honor. You definitely won't nor could you possibly be disappointed with any song on the cd. Chris and that fiddle can take you somewhere if you close your eyes. Laura on the bass. And best of all, you know they enjoy making this music for us. Such sonwriting!"
5,Misty Rivers Rising will gently make your heart rise and free it to do the work of the heart,Rising is an album whose songs are written in the language of the heart . . . it acknowledges both heart filled love and broken-heartedness . . . grace and doubt . . . being lost and being found. All of this is interpreted with a divine sense of kindness that frees the heart to feel what it needs to feel . . . whether its serenity or honest despair. Smooth harmonic vocals sung genuinely bring this kindness to the auditory realm. The instrumentals are a combination of minimalism and very professional and well chosen riffs from a gently crisp mandolin and fiddle as well as a very audible but soft bass line. The minimalism gives the music a very soothing sound and the riffs pluck the strings of the heart to create a truly poingiant experience whether it's beauty or its alive with sadness or heartfelt blues.
2,Ugh!,"This book is not what I'd expected. Expecially from the reviews its gotten. I have VC++ and right off the bat I couldn't even get the 1st example to work. Finally after searching all over the place I found out that I had to link a few DLL's, which the book fails to mention. Not a cool book at all. Ugh!"
3,Not bad- not great either!,"This book covers a LOT of OpenGL material. The first 3 chapters of the book are great, with a few exceptions. He doesn't explicitely state that you must link OpenGL32.lib and Glaux.lib to your application before you're able to use those libraries in your app. - 1 star! By the 4th chapter, the reader (or at least I was) ready to jump into 3d programming. However, by the 4th chapter, I became discouraged because the author suddenly assumes that you have entry-level windows progamming! I didn't... thus, that's as far in the book I got. Why did I still give it 3 stars? Because it deserves it! It covers a lot of material, and if you already have some experience in windows programming, I'd rate this book higher (to a 4). This is a great book- if you know windows programming to a certain (basic) extent."
3,OpenGL Superbible,"I found this book dropped off precipitously in substantive content after the first few chapters. It is adequate for a novice but quickly became inadequate when trying to obtain a deeper understanding of OpenGL. Agree with reviewer who said title should be different, and to some extent, share the ""UGH"" reviewer's sentiments."
5,Good Product,"Product arrived fresh, in good condition, and quickly. It's a box full of bags of Peanut M&M's - what else is there to say? Now I'm ready to start my own Quicky Mart."
3,Inaccuracies,"Overall not bad. However, I was disappointed for a couple of reasons. First of all there are some inaccurate statements made by the narrator and I am surprised NFL FILMS did not edit the dvd before releasing it. It would have been professional. For example, the narrator states that after the 1972 Immaculate Reception game, the Raiders defeated the Steelers 3 straight games in a row. That is not true as the Steelers beat the Raiders during the 1973 regular season. Also, he states that the Raiders were the first Wild Card team to make it to the Super Bowl. Completely untrue ! I am surprised that the editors did not catch these inaccuracies and this makes me wonder about their other DVD releases. How much of the information is accurate on these NFL documentaries? Makes you wonder. The other disappointment is that there was no retrospective on safety Jack Tatum, the hardest hitter in the history of the NFL."
4,Raiders DVD,"I assume that everything was fine with this item. I purchased it as a gift for a friend whose favorite NFL team is the Raiders. I've heard no complaints from him about the DVDs, so I would say that I am happy with my decision to buy it."
5,take no prisoners,The banner they fly the skull and crossbones is a clue to their personality.Show no mercy. Take no prisoners. This DVD is what a raiders fan wants to see. The Raiders destroying people.
3,Very cool .. but not quite as good as some other DVDs in the series,"In the early 70s I hated the Raiders, especially when they beat my favorite teams, the Steelers and Dolphins. But those were great games and great teams on both sides.While it's great to see highlights of those days, this video is a bit shallow. There is just not enough time spent on the great players who made the team so fun to watch (or hate). I would have liked to see more in depth on the awesome Raiders secondary, and the lethal hits they used to mete out. Otis Sistrunk wasnt mentioned as far as I could tell, but he was one of the more interesting characters of the team. It's entertaining, but there isn't a lot of time spent on your favorite players and teams."
2,"Agreed, full games are better. I have them","I agree that just watching highlights of classic games does the game no justice at all. You need to see the entire game, the ebb and flow, the momentum changes, the crowd, the blocks, the power run on 3rd and 2 that kept a touchdown driving going, etc. to fully appreciate the game. I have just about every classic Raiders game in its entirety. The Ghost to the Post game, the Holy Roller, the Super Bowl wins, classic games against the Dolphins and Steelers. Email me for more information."
4,Really good stuff from the 70's British folk-rock scene,"Ellington was an American ex-pat living in the UK in the early 70's. He was hooked-in with the Fairport crowd and played on some Fairport stuff as well as having some of the Fairport guys (Richard Thompson and others)play on a couple of his five albums. His stuff is very good, with very nice vocals. It's pretty much country-tinged, and reminds me of some of Ian Matthews solo stuff. The three albums he recorded for the Phillips label have all been released in mini-LP format on the Korean Big Pink label, and I recommend all of them, as well as this CD if your into Ian Matthews, Matthews Southern Comfort, or Plainsong."
3,EVA from a Senior Management Perspective,"EVA Challenge was OK. It is more geared towards senior managers who are thinking about EVA as a model for their companies. In that regard, this books does a fine job.I was hoping the book would deal with more of the matamatics associated with defining EVA in relation to various projects and business decisions. This book contailed very little information in this regard."
1,Doesn't Work,"This product seemed to work okay for about two days. Frankly, the mental suffering was the worst part, because unwisely, I only researched it *after* applying the first dose to my dog. The web is full of stories about seizures, burn spots, organ failure and even death associated with Zodiac Spot On (don't even THINK about using their cat version), so I was terrified I'd harmed my dog. Fortunately, he's okay, but now he has this product in his system, tons of fleas and I'm afraid to double-dose him with a quality systemic like Advantix or Frontline. If only I'd done the research ahead of time. PS, this mfr (Wellmark International) purportedly claims they will return your money if you still have the box and the product doesn't work. However, they have not responded to my emails at all."
1,Do NOT put this on your DOG,"We tried Zodiac Spot On tick control for our small (and awesome) mutt. Within 24 hours he was shivering uncontrollably and trying to scratch the area where the poison was applied. We called an emergency vet who told us never to purchase Zodiac or other over the counter meds like this and that these reactions were very common, especially in small dogs. I regret that we did not check with our vet in the first place, but will NEVER make the mistake of putting this crap on my dog again. Thankfully, after three baths and a lot of liquids, he is doing fine.Disclaimer: I do NOT work for any vet or pet medicine company. I am a just a dog owner who doesn't want to see this happen to your dog or you."
5,Excellent value!,"I gather that some dogs have negative reactions to this product but my three (one with sensitive skin) have all been fine with it. IT WORKS and it COSTS MUCH LESS than the other brands (some of which don't work as well as this does). TRY IT...if your dog has a reaction, chuck it...you won't be out much money BUT if you dog is OK with it, you'll love this product and the money you save!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Do not waste your time or money on this product. I decided to try it because, if by chance it worked, I'd be paying $20 every three months for my three dogs instead of $50 a month for their usual Frontline. My three dogs are going back on Frontline immediately. I also tried the Zodiac Flea Collars which only keep fleas away from the neck line for a couple weeks."
1,Dangerous product.,"Within an hour of applying this Zodiac Spot on flea control, my dog was yelping and twitching. It's been a week, and after a bath and vet visit she is still suffering. The vet said that this product should be banned, it harmed a lot of animals."
1,Do not buy!,"Put this on our 13lb dog for mosquito control. He started itching like crazy, it's been 2 days, have to give him benadryl. Spend the extra money on the good stuff for the sake of your dog."
1,Doesnt Work,Waste of Money doesnt work at all. I tried multiple applications in the same week and still nothing died on my puppy
5,This stuff WORKS so good,"I've brought this stuff in the past not online but in the petco store itself and my dog and cats never itched or got sick after using this product, its cheap and worth the money to me atleast I've never had a problem with this stuff and i plan on buying it in the future should something occur"
5,An Invaluable Research Tool!,"I consider this book to be one of the best dollhouse references out there. Every page has color photos. Many of the furniture pieces are photographed individually. Each photograph is clear and detailed. The author is careful to note when a piece is original, antique, or modern. Everything in this book is well-researched and documented. You could carve replica furniture pieces from the photographs in here, they are that good!Needless to say, the houses featured in here are gorgeous in their own right. My favorite part of this book are the great photos of the Grodnertal peg-wooden dolls. This book contains some of the best Grodnertal photos I've ever seen!"
5,Phonics Guidelines,THis text is an excellent source for information on phonics. It should be on the desk of every K-12 teacher. The programmed learning format is easy to use and comprehend.
1,THEY SENT ME A FAKE-CHEAP CHINESE BULB,"i have a solana hqi pendant and love the color of the stock current 14k bulb. after a year of use, i decided to buy another one. i ordered my powerpaq 150 watt 14k from here, and some knock off company saltwater discount shipped it to me. when i got the bulb it was very off color, nothing like what my old current powerpaq bulb looked like. the bulb came in a no name box, with nothing but numbers labeled on it. i did a google search for the numbers on the box and got a wholesale website for made-in-china knock of metal halides. the color is very white/yellow and my corals hate it. do not buy this product, it is a fake!!!"
2,Some of the least exciting music you'll ever hear,"I cannot believe ECM has fallen for this trio. Just because they're Nordic and fairly photogenic, that doesn't mean they should be chosen above all the aspiring jazz trios and quartets who don't have a recording contract.I've got most of Keith Jarrett's albums, and several Lyle Mays, Bill Evans, John Taylor and Chick Corea CDs, but I have to say that I've heard several hotel bar bands that are more alive than this trio. I'm not even convinced it's jazz -- it certainly wouldn't come within the Wynton Marsalis classification of the the genre.The trio's other album is just as soporific. (And I appreciate that most other Amazon reviewers think it's great.) This is Horlicks for the soul. If you want excitement in your piano jazz, try any of the Keith Jarrett at the Blue Note box set."
2,No Bill Evans,Nice simplistic mood music...but dont metion this guy in the same breath as Bill Evans just yet.
4,Echt ECM,"I'm not a huge fan of this kind of nouvelle-cuisine ECM piano trio music but it's hard to deny that this is an excellent example of the genre. The tempos and dynamics never get much more pulse-quickening than a slow simmer but they always have a pulse--there's plenty of space & pauses for reflection but this never turns into tempoless navel-gazing. The stylistic reference-points--jazz, gospel, Satie, pop, bossa, tango, the odd Spanish tinge, &c--are so abstracted & quietened down that they blur imperceptibly into each other. The tunes more or less run together too, ranging from melancholic languor to, er, languorous melancholy. This is mood music--but it's _good_ mood music."
2,cheaply made,"The thermostat is pretty cheaply made. The knob doesn't push on easily and that piece that attaches the thermostat to the heater bends in when you try to push the knob on. I finally gave up and just stuck it on a little so I can turn it, but it will probably fall off. I needed another one and got one from a different manufacturer. The other one is a LOT better made at a slightly lower price."
5,my husband loves this watch,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He really loves this watch. We recently went on a trip across the country. this watch changed time before we landed. it is water resistant, and pretty tough. for the price i think it was a great buy."
2,PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING,"I bought this watch from amazon and as soon as I took it out of the box, I packed it back up and sent it back. It might be a great watch with tons of cool features, but before you buy know what you are getting. The face is NOT blue, it is actually purple so don't expect a nice blue faced watch. Second the watch is massive, not face diameter, but how much it sticks off your wrist. I measured it around 3/4 inch, but am unable to find any websites with exact demensions. In any case it is not a heavy watch but a purple bulky watch, be warned!!!!"
5,very cool watch,"I was initially intmidated by th novel size instruction manual, but this watch is actually very user friendly. It performs as promised, and looks pretty cool too. I love ALMOST everything about this watch, except the light. It would be much better with an Indiglo type rather than the yellow LED. At least the hands glow in the dark. I am very happy with this watch, and hope it lasts many years."
4,The perfect watch...almost,"When this watch works, it's the perfect watch: stylish enough to wear anywhere that matters, while still being rugged enough for most situations, such as water-resistant enought to wear in the shower at the gym and being able to light up in the dark. I've never had a problem with the time being set automatically and it's actually more useful than I'd expect to know that it really has the right time. However, I'm having trouble getting it to stay charged on solar power right now (December/January - the shortest days of the year) - it frequently goes out and I have to leave it in the window for half a day to get the charge back. It doesn't actually lose the time, but the display goes out so it's useless while it recharges. I'm hoping it does better as the days get longer and it can get more sunlight in regular use."
2,Looks good....doesn't work.,"Bought this watch to give to my husband for Christmas. The overall look is great, a little bulky, but nice overall. The watch face isn't purple in my opinion (other reviewer's mentioned this) and my husband didn't think so either. May be that I got a lemon, but the hands stopped working after two days. Tried resetting them by hand and they didn't hold time for very long. The digital time worked fine, but who wants a watch with hands that don't work. Overall I was very disappointed."
3,The watch for kids,"Bought this watch for $75 from Amazon. It looks cheap, feels light and plastic. I own a Seiko Men's Arctura Kinetic Auto Relay Watch #SNG043, it's heavy and solid. The backlight doesn't cover the LCD window. Its atomic function works fine. Its battery doesn't gets fully charged after leave directly under sun light 1 hour."
5,Negrophobia,I personally think James is a journalistic genius! The book was excellent. Anyone who gave this book a bad rating has his/her own issues about race relations. Darius James found an artistic way to define how we as individuals subconciously think and cope with regard to dealing with people of opposing races. This book is definitely a winner. I recommend this to everyone.
3,OK,"This book is ok, the Princeton Review is much, much better. The test's are over the top hard, they are nowhere near what the ACT is. So, the reviews are good, but the tests are not like the real ACT"
2,FIRE HOT!,"I've tried many of the different Zotes seeds and have loved them all, until I bought these. These are really spicy, don't get me wrong I like spicy stuff but these are pretty much unbearable. Unless you're up for the challenge, I would steer clear of these and stick to something a little safer. You've been warned..."
5,An excellent technical guide,"The AP Stylebook And Briefing On Media Law is a classic reference has been fully revised and updated to provide readers with the latest details on media law, probing newsrooms, journalism classes, and different styles of writing. Fifty new entries and revisions keep up with world events, common usage, and AP procedures and include sections on the Internet and current media law. An excellent technical guide."
3,Be warned,"I hate it when you buy a CD for a particular song, then you discover they used a NON-vocal version of a song known for its lyrics. ""Happy Days are Here Again"" is instrumental only on this CD. I also bought a ""Songs of the Civil War"" CD recently that DIDN'T have a vocal version of Dixie, only instrumental. Gyp. The song listings don't warn you of an instrumental-only track, and you can't click for a 30-second preview of ""Happy Days"". So look out. All in all, the CD isn't bad though. Some good stuff on it."
3,Not a server,"I like the way it mixes an Italian salad dressing - the only thing that was a little weird was the pouring - the lid has to be lifted out and balanced while you pour unless you take the whole mixer/lid piece out - but then where do you put the messy thing? I think the mixer part is okay, but it's not really a server you'd put on the table for guests to use."
1,I should have read the reviews more closely!,"The concept of this product is good, but the design is not practical. I did not even use the product, but returned it after opening the box as the design flaws were immediately evident. While the recipes printed on the bottle are good, they are difficult to read and the markings are hard to make out for measurement purposes. The mixer part of the bottle does not reach all the way to the bottom; the gap is more than 1/2 of an inch. To serve the dressing after mixing would be too cumbersome -- you have to remove the entire top with the mixer attached to it, which would result in dripping or spillage (the seal is tight). And last but not least, it is made of cheap plastic, not glass. I do not recommend this purchase at all."
3,Norpro Salad-Dressing Stirrer,"I purchased to replace another that had broken due to excessive use. I make my own dressings as they're healthier and need to have a stirrer such as this one. This particular one isn't as ""user friendly"" as my older one. It stirs well however, there isn't a way to pour the dressing unless you take the entire top off at which time, the oil and vinegar has separated. It's an okay stirrer and I will look for something a little easier to pour."
2,pwilson,I prefer the spinner to have a more substantial base to it. This one is open at the base and so the liquid that sits at the bottom - eg like honey never gets mixed through the dressing. I will probably buy a different one.
2,Mixer incredibly difficult,"Mixer is very difficult to turn. Would not recommend, even though it is cheap. Container is plastic. Recommend going to your local grocery and getting a cruet in the salad dressing aisle instead."
4,Great device,Great little device. Recipes on the side and stirrer. It's not a necessity but it's fun and convenient.
3,Norpro salad dressing bottle,"I really like the look of this salad dressing bottle. And everyone really enjoys ""stirring"" the dressing before adding to their salad. The big negative is it drips down the side of the bottle when you pour because you have to loosen the top to pour."
1,So Disappointed--Try the Other One!,"My husband and I are RBD fans, and I bought this DVD noting that it was recently released and assuming it would be current. I'm not sure when the concert in L.A. actually occurred, but it's quite obvious that it took place early in RBD's career. The venue was small, the audio was terrible, there was very little staging, and the performances were so disappointing. I recommend you skip this one and try RBD's ""Tour Generacion, RBD en Vivo"" instead. It restored our faith in their talent after viewing the disaster entitled ""RBD Live in Hollywood""."
4,Well put together film Preachy liberal spin throughout.,The movie itself is well done with a terrific cast.It was too preachy though.It reminded me of Cindy Sheehan who is nowhere to be found now that Barack Hussein Obama is running the wars in the Middle East and still in Afghanistan.Also where is the liberal media about killing with drones and killing supposedly Bin Laden?
5,It Works!,"My sony location free IR emitter stopped working. This was the perfect replacement, small, extra long wire and does the job. Great product for the price. Buy this if you need an IR emitter!"
2,Becareful,"Only works with certain remote controls. If you want to buy it make sure that your remote control is listed in the literature before you order it, I had to send it back because I did not check my remote contrrol against the listed units.I bought a different kind, more expensive but well worth the money"
2,"Umm, I don't think so.","I love all of PH's previous albums, but ""Skin"" makes me want to jump out of mine. Abrasive and obvious, without any of the tenderness and theologically astute observations of his previous work."
5,It's helpful for M.E. for plastic parts design.,It's helpful for M.E. for plastic parts design. So many informations to help engineers how to design plastic parts and how to asembly it.
1,Disgusted,This book dated back 15 years - I know this because it is/was a library book - the date stamp panel and category label are still there.The page edges have been scribbled uponThe book itself is in very poor condition - binding has gone and pages are falling out.The technical content is what I wanted but I can't believe I paid near $32 for it.Steamertrunkbooks should be scratched off your supplier list
1,not worth it,"Don't get this bag, unless you love Bob Marley ALOT. It's very expensive. Old Glory should lower the price to $10.00. For that price you are not getting your money's worth. I was surprise when I opened the box. A BIG minus!!!! :("
2,Kindle Edition not as described,"The kindle edition costs substantially less yet in the description it says ""with maps and illustrations."" However, there are no maps and illustrations -- text only. I am using this with a homeschool curriculum, and when the curriculum says to refer to a map in the book for an activity, I'm left without. So, if you'll be needing the illustrations as well (which always make it more interesting to the student)you may want to spend the extra money on the print edition.**Two and a half months later it looks like the description has been changed and states ""no illustrations"" for the Kindle edition."
2,First Book in American History,"This copyright is 1996....but initial copyright is 1889, and that is how it reads. Bought for my granchildren who at 11 and 14 are offput by the style. Recommend for historical value but not to improve history skills for today's generation...not going to happen!"
5,Lakota Star Knowledge Studies in Lakota Stellar Theology,Excellent book and information. I have long waited for this book and information. As Day Keeper for my nation of people Cherokee. It is excellent knowledge to see how we are all connected.
3,You might want to be a PhD in Economics,"This book is a collection of topics from some of the top Economists in the country. I try to understand macro and microeconomics as it applies to our economy and markets so I thought this would be an enlightening book. Unfortunately, the tone of the book is PhD level discussions of many theories of economics that was honestly ""over my head"" I'm sure if you are a graduate student of economics you'd find this book very informative. I can't really comment on the content except to say that it was difficult to understand for a college graduate with engineering degrees. I'm sure it is a fantastic collection of thoughts for the right crowd."
3,A Good Time Capsule...,"A moment in time of a great artist,but the sound is not as good as other SRV live recordings."
3,disappointing,"Not as I expected however the intro to ""Lenny"" was fascinating as it contains mostly the intro to ""Riviera Paradise"", which was not studio recorded for some time after this performance. Overall, it was just another bootleg cleaned up and while the SRV-nut will want this for their collection, it is not one of his best releases."
4,Great Find,"I was unaware that this was available on import and I'm glad I bought it. This live recording features SRV in top form and recorded during a brief period when SRV was practicing sobriaty. This is a strong set featuring 10 crisp, clean songs.I do have to ding one star for poor editing and a liner note error. The liner notes say that ""Lenny"" launches into ""Testify"", acutally you will find ""Testify"" reprise on ""Voodoo Child"". Speaking of ""Voodoo Child"", everyone will agree that the only one to play Hendrix, in the style of Hendrix, better than Hendrix is SRV; however I did find this version of ""Voodoo Child"" a little self indulgent.Over all, this is what Live Alive should have been."
1,Official release??,I Think this is not Official Album.I can not Love Bootleg.Because Steveie & His Family do not smile this album.
3,Harry Potter Hardcover Box Set Books 1-6,"I was very pleased to find an affordable price. This was a Christmas gift for my daughter who wanted the set so badly, but I wouldn't spend the amount that the book stores were asking. I knew I would find it on Amazon."
4,Need I say More?,"Nothing else really needs to be said here, except this would clearly be a great gift for someone who hasn't read them all before. Loses 1 star simply because real Potter fans would import the UK editions from amazon.co.uk!"
2,"great reading,horrible quality of books","I love the Harry Potter books and finally convinced my husband to read them. I bought this set so I wouldn't have to buy them individually. The quality of this set is absolutely horrible! The books are barely bound, so the pages are lose and falling out, and some of the books have the pages sliced up, from where they didn't cut them right. Really disappointed with the condition, but the novels are still fun to read."
2,Missing pages,"In reading the series, when I got to Book #3, I found the book was missing 29 pages. My book went from page 116 to page 145. That was a very disappointing."
4,A very good deal,A very good deal for people who like Harry Potter and they miss some of the volumes. The only drawback is that the paper quality of very poor even for the standards of the paperback versions.
5,Harry Potter book set,"The books arrived on time and in great condition. A wonderful, easy experience. thank you!"
3,Meh,"The quality of the books was a little disappointing. But as I'm in it for the reading, not the collecting, it wasn't too big of a deal to me. Some of the books looked a lil sloppy and after reading about people missing pages I'm going to check mine. Did they just take all the overstock from the past and shove it in a cardboard box tho?"
5,harry potter books,I purchased this set of books for my son and he has read every one and will read them many times as they are available when ever he wants to read them again. No more going to the library to get which ever one is there at that time and having to get them back for another person to check out.This is a great set for his personal collection.
5,Harry Potter boxed set,"Awesome! It's great to have all the books in one place! This is my second time reading all six books, and it's still a great story. Can't wait for #7!"
5,AWESOME,My son was very happy to recieve this set. He couldn't wait to open the package and start reading them.
5,Potter series books 1 thru 6,I am 61 years old and have loved the series of Harry Potter books. I have gotten seversl of my grandchildren interested and they borrow my books all the time. Christina asked for a complete set for Christmas. The set I bought was only the first six books. The set is wonderful. She couldn't be happier. This set was a real bargin. I plan to buy her the last book for her birthday (March 1).
2,"pages falling out, poorly bound",The Harry Potter series is excellent!!!Was very disappointed with the quality of the books as I see were several other people .... pages falling out. :o(
5,Love the set,"I'm totally pleased with this set of books. The print could be a tiny bit larger but otherwise it's an excellent value and everything else was perfect. The quality of the books is fine, as is the box."
5,Very nice set,Received this set promptly. I never dreamed I would receive this set as well as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows on the day that the latter was released. I did not expect that expeditious mailing since I had used Super Saver. I thank you so much to ensure that I received the six volume set as well as the last volume! It was very kind of you. Love doing business with Amazon.
5,Review of Harry Potter Book Set,"I think this was an excellant buy. The price was the lowest that could be found anywhere and the books came in record time, a day ahead of the schedule and arrived in excellant shape. You can't go wrong with that."
4,Excellent Books!!,"The material of these book are excelent. The only reason to do not receive 5 star, was the time to receive the Box that was too long."
1,Harry Potter Paperback - BUYER BEWARE,"I sent this set to my grandchildren. Recently, I went for a visit and they told me the books were hard to read. Chapters and pages are not in order. Pages are printed upside down. What a waste!"
4,Worth the price,"The price is attractive and all the six books are there. Nothing to lose for a reader. However, if you want to keep these books as collections, you'd better buy hardcover ones. Some of the books are so thick and pages are small, thus the spine of the book can be easily damaged during the reading."
5,Harry Potter,My purchase of the Harry Potter series was an excellent buy. I enjoy reading these books in addition to the movies. I do believe in magick.
4,A good value,"Our family hadn't yet read all the books, and we were looking for a set. This is a good value. However, with book 7 coming out soon, we are regretting not waiting to get the inevitable 7-book set."
5,Great Deal on Product,"This was a great deal, and I saved alot more money compared to buying these books seperate. It was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. They even shipped it for free!"
2,HARRY POTTER PAPERBACK BOX SET,PRODUCT WAS TO HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY ME BEFORE DEC 8. I HAVE NOT RECEIVEDUPRODUCT NOR ANY EXPLANATION. AMAZON E-MAIL TO ME OF DEC 12 SAID MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RELAYED TO SENDER (REN THE READER). I WILL APPRECIATE AMZON'S CURRENT REASSURANCE THAN MY ORDER WILL SOON ARRIVE. THANKS MUCH. STAN HUNT

5,Splendid,I bought this set as a Christmas gift. The person receiving the set was absolutely thrilled! Not only with the set as a collection but the books themseleves have proven to be hours of wonderful and imaginative entertainment!
5,Harry Potter boxed set,Didnt want to spring for individual books great value for a fun series to read
4,Really Great,I only spent $30.00 plus S&S but I have already read them all now once and am working on a second time. I currently have 2 books rented out to friends. I have orded the set with them in hard cover and a nice box but I wanted a set that I could through into a suitcase and take with me when I travel or to lend to friends without being to scared of what kind of condition they would return home in. This was a fantastic purchase for me
5,Great Investment,This set is great to have and keep for those with kids who may not yet be able to read. The well written and imaginative storylines will be enjoyed for generations.
5,Great Characters,"At this point I guess everyone know that Harry Potter is a great series filled with great characters and an interesting and not completely obvious plot. A great book for adults and young adults a little. Personally my favorite aspect of the books is that when they age, they actually age. The don't just get bigger, but they get more mature and start to think more. A truly great set of books."
5,fantastic,The product was in great condition. We also recieved the product in a prompt manner. Very happy with the product and the delivery.
5,5 Stars!,I received this set very quickly and haven't been able to put them down since. I'm currently reading book 5 and hope to have book 6 read before the movie's release this summer. I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in this genre!
4,entire set,"The stories were amazing ,however look out for my book on wizards and witches soon to appear at a book shop near you. I however wish to comment on the packaging. The quality of the print-these I found rather a shell of the magnificance of the books themselves."
5,Harry Potter Paperback Box Set,This was a Christmas gift for my son.He's a big fan of Harry Potter and I thought that he would enjoy having the books again and which he did.
5,Harry Potter Paperback Book Set (Books 1-6),"I bought the series to keep up with my grand-kids, Harry is one of their favorite topics and ""play action figures,"" as I read, I became more fascinated with Harry and with following his adventures. I'm looking forward to ""Deathly Hallows."""
3,Great Set of Books,The Harry Potter boxed set was in great condition when we received and my daughter was so excited about having the entire set to read over the summer.
1,Harry Potter box set received in bad condition,"When I received the box set of Harry Potter that I ordered, the box had been opened and there was damage to the books. I already had all the books in hardback and ordered this set to have copies of the books I could take to the beach or anywhere else they had a greater chance of getting damaged so it didn't seem worth it to send them back. When I received the books, there was a lot of damage to the case the books are supposed to be kept in and there is damage on the spines of almost every book. Since this is my ""back up"" collection of the books anyway I don't really need to send them back I just thought I would let you know that they arrived in such bad condtion."
1,Where are my books?,"Ordered the books 4/7 and it is 5/20 and I still don't have them. Shipping to the U.S. Virgin Islands takes some time, but this is ridiculous. I'm trying to find a way to communicate with customer service on your web site . . . it seems that option does not exist. I'm so frustrated I will never order from you again unless you respond to me NOW!!!!"
1,Not received yet nearly 3 weeks after order,"Don't know how the product is, am still waiting for it nearly 3 weeks later. I chose to order from Amazon as I thought it was a more trusty source than other dealers through Amazon - yet, still no books! Disappointing. I don't understand the delay. Emails state they are coming, but this is a LONG wait!"
1,Badly Written,"My friends insisted I read it. This is a very poorly written book with stereotypical characters, thin plot elements, shallow thematic development, silly attempts at humor and about as much originality as a typical television show. It is really sad to see something like this get so much attention. If kids grow up on this sort of thing, it is no wonder that as adults they have no sense of thoughtful and well-written literature. Read this only if your idea of great literature is Robert Parker, Stephen King, or a Spiderman comic. God help us all."
5,Harry Potter set of 6 books,I was very happy with the shipment and product. It arrived in a timely fashion.
3,A nice six-book set in a seven-book collection,"What better gift for a Harry Potter fan than a set of six hardback books in a nice container? I don't know, maybe all seven! The box in which they come is well crafted, but it seems like they should have waited a bit longer and included all seven books. We bought this as a gift and had to give book 7 separately, which in the big picture of life isn't a big deal. But it would have been nicer if they had a seven book collection for sale. Hold out for that if you are not in a hurry to get the books."
5,Harry Potter series,The books were great and the company sent them in an extremely timely fashion. I would order from them again.
5,Harry Potter: another great series lines my library shelf,"I have to admit, i was skeptical of Harry potter books from when i heard they were supposed to be childrens's books. I couldn't have been more wrong. This series of books are incredible to read, keep you locked in to the end of the seventh book, and make you want to reread them, as i am doing now.This series goes into my hall of fame, along with anything Tolkien(i.e., the Lord of the Rings,etc.), Alan Dean Foster's Spellsinger series, Michael Moorcock's The eternal champion series (Elric), Terry Brook's Shannara series, and Stephen R Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series.A great purchase from a great company that has been good me ever since i've joined. Thanks, [...]"
2,Why?,"I've read all 6 of the books, I think they're great!But why would you spend $100 on a 6 book box set... when there are 7 books in the series? Better to hold off on buying the box set until is a... complete set. But maybe that's just me.2 Stars because the books are incredible."
2,Check all books carefully,"My problem was that these books were missing chunks of pages! We didn't notice it until book 4 of 6, but 80+ pages were gone! Now, Amazon was great about replacing the set adn paying for me to return the messed-up set. This is just a warning to check your boxed set when it gets in for missing chunks of pages!Of course, the Harry Potter series is great, adn we love having them in paperback."
1,Ordering from Amazon,Ordering from AmazonI was trying to order the box set. Although I buy stuff over the internet all the time your website is confusing that I will just go buy if at Borders
1,THIS BOOK STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Listen people!!!!!!!! this is the most horrible book ever written!!!!!!!! Don't you see that this is the worst idea ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Harry Potter Paperback box set (1-6),Excited to have them and looking forward to reading them to our grandchildren. They are each in very good condition.
2,GR,I ordered the Harry Potter Hardcover Box Set (Book 1-6) one month ago. I was promised it would come by September 2nd. 10 days later my order is still not here. very disappointed.
5,harry potter box set (books 1-6),"great value, so far i have found the books great, i would recommend this set for anyone, plus it's a great collectors item. i am very satisfied."
5,Nearly the complete set...,"This was exactly the product I was looking for, since I had pre-ordered and received the final book when it came out. I had borrowed the rest of the series to read and wanted a set of my own, but didn't want an extra copy of Deathly Hallows. This product was perfect, nicely packaged, and exactly what I wanted. How can it get better than that? (plus it was pretty reasonably priced)"
5,Magical book collection!!,"Beautifull book set, hardcover, magnificent ilustrations,I recomend it to readers of all ages, It is a comtemporary master piece of literature, Ms. J. K. Rowling its the true wizard behind the Harry Potter saga!!!!"
1,Missing the point of the novel,"The movie abruptly ends and completely ignores the final and most important chapter from the original book. The last chapter is what makes you read the next book. I could not believe they removed this from the movie. If you have not read the novel then the movie does not disappoint, but from a fan of the book, I was utterly annoyed and frustrated."
4,Underrated,I think the only reason that this film was not more successful in the U.S. is because the books were not as well known as in England. The movie is exciting and well made on every level. The 2 disc set is the only way to go because the special features are exactly what real movie buffs have grown to expect. Hope they make the sequel.
1,"I was like, ""Wha?!?!""","I am sorry I spent all three dollars on this movie. I never read the book, nor would I. This movie was so boring and, really?, people's souls are called daemon's? Wow! Alright then, I guess whatever floats your boat. I wouldn't watch this movie again if it was free!"
2,Don't watch this if you'v ever read the book!!!,"For those who are familiar withPhilip Pullman's His Dark Materials Trilogywill be greatly unsatisfied with the adaptation of the fist book in Pullman's trilogy. Much of the story is left told, some chapters along with characters and groups of character are completely cut out while others are rearranged or switched out, even rewritten. this gives the movie the feeling of being rushed and not fully completed before it hit the screen. Someone should have put more thought into this adaptation before trying to put it on the screen. There was only one thing about this movie that i did find pleasing and that was the casting of the characters. All the actors preformed the part wonderfully in spite of the over all uncompleted feeling the movie leaves you with. The actors are the only reason i am giving this movie 2 stars instead of one."
3,I greatly enjoyed it but...,"As a fan of Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Narnia I gave this movie a chance. I found I greatly enjoyed it. After having read the book (after I saw the movie) I must say, they did leave out the most important chapter, and even though it did not take away my initial enjoyment, it left me a bit disappointed and wanting. In a world of long movies, what was 30 more minutes to show us the ending we should have had. Overall I still like the movie and intend on buying it when it's released on DVD."
4,compass,a good movie but it has left me hanging for entirely to long. If you have not watched it wait until the other parts on the movie come out.
4,Childish with dark undertones,"The film has a childish whimsy to it mixed with a dark sinister big brother undertone. My niece and nephew love this film, and were unable to pick up on the big brother type themes, so likely it will be acceptable for kids that are younger. My niece is 4 and my nephew 9."
3,Fine flick,I was entertained and would watch a sequel if one is ever made. I used Instant Video to rent this.
3,Golden Compass,"It is very entertaining and worth the watch. The only disappointment, is the ending. It really leaves on hanging and making them try to figure it out. It is a good watch and special effects are great."
4,Not as good as the books,"I really liked the movie before I read the book. I felt that the special effects were fantastic, and some of Pullman's concepts were showcased nicely. However, the narrative of the movie does not flow well. Sequencing is off, and some parts seem compressed. The ending does not leave the viewer wanting anything. I listened to the director's commentary, and he gave a decent reason. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen. If you're a fan, then you almost have to see it, but you shouldn't expect it to be as good as the books. The cast and the effects are awesome, but the storytelling would've been better had it been more straight from the book with better pacing."
3,Corny and cliche with some nice effects,"Perhaps with all the hype I went into this movie expecting too much. Also, the basic premise of a modern alternate-world fantasy intrigued me. My expectations were not met.The characters are not poorly portrayed, but neither are they particularly interesting. The ""surprise"" of Lyra's heritage is groaningly cliche. The biggest groans, however, came at the introduction of each main character. The camera work and dialogue at these moments made me feel as if a big ""Ta-Da!"" should have erupted at the introduction of each character.I never really got into the plot, and having not read the book until after, I spent a bit of the movie going ""wha?"" (I was too confused to make a proper ""what"") The movie is quite loyal to the book and deviates only in places where a movie should deviate. The effects are decent although the bears are a bit...blocky. It is, however, an alternate world. Perhaps they just have blocky bears there, who am I to say?"
3,Needs a new stylist,"I enjoyed the film and don't have a lot to add to prior reviews. I was, however, very surprised at the terrible make-up job on Nicole Kidman athroughout. I realize that Mrs. Coulter is supposed to look ""hard"", but it was way, way overdone. The eyebrows were actually cartoonish. Why do they do this?"
1,A Big Nothing...,"I am a devout, strict Roman Catholic, so this movie, and the others to follow in the series...along with the books that accompany it, are garbage to me.The author has said that the theme is about killing God, so I would not support him even in the slightest way."
1,horrible,"This movie is so horrible. I would not recommend your kids watch it. It is the worst movie ever, considering it is all about going against GOD. I would not compare it to narnia at all. Narnia is a christian based movie and books! Warning: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
2,Rip off,"Am I the only one who finds it ridiculous that the studios are trying to charge $35 for a film that is one third of a trilogy? The cgi are impressive but the plot leaves the viewer hanging, as does the book. Unlike the Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia the Golden Compass really doesn't stand on its own. However, I suspect that Middle America will be very upset if the trilogy is filmed and the third episode is true to the book."
2,A little less magic,"Any artist that produces a work that features the theme that wicked and dour adults grind the ""magic"" out of children has not been in a classroom full of 14 year olds lately. Put director Weitz or novelist Pullman in any local middle school for a single school day and they would go screaming into the night.Nicole Kidman was the best thing about the movie. Dakota Blue Richards was pretty weak. I liked the bear better when it was a lion in ""Narnia."""

3,DANIEL CRAIG MIA!,"The movie is fun, great to look at, and should receive recognition for the special effects, art direction and photography. The New York Times aptly described Nicole Kidman as the movie's best special effect - her cold, glacial beauty is perfect for this role. The biggest disappointment is the brevity of Daniel Craig's role. When photographed at the premiere, he looked strangely subdued and serious, and in an interview, in his usual tactful manner, mentioned that other scenes were filmed, but not used in the final cut. He reportedly has great admiration for the book, and most assuredly expected more from his role in the movie. What a waste of his fine talent, although, as always, he lights up the screen in the moments when he is allowed to appear."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Golden Compass is not a perfect film--it feels incomplete at times and some of the plotlines, like Daniel Craig's, are given the short shrift--but it's an entertaining and enjoyable enough fantasy film for those who don't find it ideologically offensive."
4,Fun adventure movie,"This movie is a bit dark and violent, which is surprising because it was not advertised that way. I would of liked to see this series expanded on more as seems like its based on a good book series as well."
3,Movie was okay but the streaming not so much.,The movie was fine I just did not like the streaming. It did not stream correctly. It keep losing the streaming connection and I had to literally push play again to restart the movie.
4,Good action picture for younger adults; also good for fantasy,This is a good action picture for younger people who like a little fantasy. I can't offhand think of anything that would affend the parents if they let their kids see this picture.
4,Waiting for more,This was a fun movie to watch if one is a fan of this kind of story. I loved the books and the story line of the movie was close.
5,Good,"This was a good movie, I love the polar bears. They were cool with the armor and stuff, even read the book."
4,Good movie overall,"The movie looks and sounds great! the plot feels a bit fast and character development suffers from it, but the movie remains entertaining!"
2,Lacking,"The main problem with this movie is that I never believe what's going on. It's feels like a Narnia knock-off. An adventure for an adventure sakes. I never understood WHY LYRA. What made her so special? Even Nicole Kidman's performance is a reminder of the White Witch in Narnia. I never really understand the dust thing and exactly what they mean about it settling in their daemons. I thought about watching it again to try to understand again-but I just don't want to. My time is worth more than that. However, I suspect that the book is a lot better than this film."
3,hmmmmm....,"...well...i still have issues with the religious right that feel the books and the movie are based on atheism. when will they take the time to read between the lines and recognize that pullman was writing about the religious dogmas that people take to far extremes to commit atrocities in the name of their god? would they have been happier if the film was based in a middle eastern world, instead?having said that, i felt rather let down by the movie makers who watered down the story in order to get more people into the theatres.it was a decent film and i do hope that they decide to bring the rest of the trilogy to the big screen."
2,Buy the book.,"Save your money and by the books. This is one of the most fascinating and captivating stories I have ever read. The movie just disapoints and completely leaves out the meat of the story. The movie you create in your head will be worth it. The movie had such potential, adding things that never happened in the book and leaving out key pieces just left me feeling like I wasted $20."
3,If you didn't like the film...,Please please please read the book. There is so much more to it than could ever be included in a film.I feel sure there will be a directors cut.
1,NOT a family movie,I bought this since it was listed in the kids and family section. Its clearly not for young kids.
1,Anti Christian story - don't finish the trilogy,"I'm not generally into rating things as a nonChristian....actually I consider myself ""spiritual not religious"" but after reading the trilogy I felt compelled to warn others. While the story is fine for the first 2 books when you get to the 3'rd it turns out the plot is about ""God"" being a fake and satin being the only one smart enough to recognize it...this part of the story is narrated by 2 homosexual angles. It just went too far for me and I wish I'd know that this is what the trilogy was about before I started it. Granted I haven't been able to make it to the end of the book but read 1/3 of the last book before I gave up hoping it'd turn into something good.This is a review concerning the books."
1,Anti-Christian Cult Film,"THE GOLDEN COMPASS is written by Phillip Pullman, a proud athiest who belongs to secular humanist societies. He hates C. S. Lewis's Chronical's of Narnia and has written a trilogy to show the other side. The movie has been dumbed down to fool kids and their parents in the hope that they will buy his trilogy where in the end the children kill God and everyone can do as they please. This is no joke, research it for yourself before you buy this junk!"
1,????????,"When I watched this movie at the theater I wish I could just yell out ""START THE MOVIE OVER PLEASE!"" the reason is: This movie was probably thee hardest movie to follow, the whole time i was just wondering what the hell was going on! BAD MOVIE!!!!! And during the movie they couldn't resist talking about DUST! ""yeah I got some Dust on my counter this morning it's fantastic!!!"" DUST DUST DUST!!!"
1,Too bad you can't give it a 0/5 stars,"I will put this the nicest way I can.I did not read the book. You shouldn't have to read a book to go see the movie.Sitting in the movie watching it. the Char's will say something that you have NO idea what in the world they are talking about. (and on several occasions) It makes NO sense, it has nothing to do with ANYTHING.The writers ""Assume"" you have read the book.We all know what happens when you Assume now, don't we?0/5 Stars for a film that makes NO sense, Will more than likely have an equally horrid sequel to it, and the highlight is when a bear fights. Oooh Ahhh... I can't tell you how ashamed my 2 friends and I were that we wasted money on this movie. Please do yourself the favor and don't make the same mistake."
2,Golden Compass leaves you hanging,"Seems like the whole movie was made just to set up a sequel, unfinished movie. The end doesn't complete the journey."
3,Good Movie But...,"Ok I'll say it wasn't a bad movie. As people have said the acting wa great and the animation was awesome, I especially liked Pantalimon aka Pan. I wish they hadn't moved the Bolvangar scene to after the Svalbard scene but I can live with it because they were well done. But, what really bugged me is why they left out the most gripping part of the book, the ending. I mean the revelation of how crazy Azriel is is one of my favorite part. They shouldn't have left out his kidnapping poor Roger and Lyra's attempt to rescue him and they should have left in the opening of the gate and the romantic talk between Coltier and Azriel at the gate. That was my big beef with the movie and they had better put it in the Subtle Knife movie or I will be mad. Oh yeah, the only other thing that truly bugged me was Lyra finding the Costa boy separated from his daemon, It was not him in the book it was Tony Makarios and his daemon was Ratter not the Costa boy's. Ok, I guess I've said enough."
2,very weird,"well i have to say this was a very weird film. the fact that they callled their souls deamons was very odd. i do not think that the creater of the golden compass wanted to include any message that would be against god (for all you who didnt know the author of the books doesnt believe in god but i dont think he believes in saten either.)um so yeah very weird movie i didnt get the concept of dust and what it is or why the gobblers wanted to take the children and remove them of there souls was odd and that ""cut"" was removing the dust which i still dont get!!!!! watch the movie see what ya think but i just happen to not like this movie with a burning passion because well it is very very confusing."
4,Exciting Missions,"Natalie Portman is alittle darker in this film. She has so many great performances. Dakota Blue Richards will go far in the business and she makes a great heroine in this film. Fast action, fast pace but you can follow the story line."
4,Great graphics,"The movie is OK. The graphics and sound are HD clear. I've watched the DVD version, but it doesn't compare... This 1080p release let's you feel almost like if you were there."
2,don't watch,Many parts from the book were left out. Best said it was a huge let down from the book. Don't even bother renting this movie.
3,Blu-Ray Golden Compass ...Eva Green... The Barefoot Witch,Blu-Ray Golden Compass The Best Thing for me as an Adult in this Movie is Eva Green as the Barefoot Witch ...She is a Great Actress and man is She Sexy...
5,Golden Compass,My son loves this movie. He keeps picking up rocks and pretending they're a golden compass...I'm all for anything that inspires his creativity:)
3,Not worth all of the controversy...,"This was a typical fantasy film. It isn't even in the same league as Lord of the Rings or The Chronicles of Narnia. Not the best I've ever seen, and it could have been longer. I would have liked a bit more character development. It's totally not worth all of the controversy that it's generated. I am a Christian, and I could note a few minor things that were a bit questionable, but nothing too extreme. With that said, I do think that Philip Pullman needs to back off. I also think that the zealous, extremist Christians need to cool it with all of the boycott threats, and I also feel that they owe it to themselves to see a film or to read a book before they can have an opinion on it. Boycotting only draws attention to the film, and people will usually see it regardless...and so, to all of my fellow Christians, please stop making fools of yourselves. Totally ridiculous, and like I said, not worth it. Save your money, and wait for the DVD."
4,Fun Fantasy with serious special effects,"Some say this movie has dark moments, but I found that the dark moments were mild compared to current movies available. Special effects are outstanding (making blu-ray worth the extra cost), good story, ending not terribly satisfying, hopefully there well be a sequel. Golden Compass is definatly a keeper in my collection."
2,Incomplete,"I just don't get this movie. It doesn't make sense: the filmmakers thought that this story was good enough to make a movie out of it, but then when they did make a movie out of it, they completely changed the story! I personally watch a movie for its story, not for the pretty effects.People have commented on how it left you feeling like it was made so that there could be a sequel. Really, I don't see how they're going to make a sequel. They cut out the entire last third of the book, which included the extremely important climax."
4,The Golden Compass (Blu-ray),The Golden Compass [Blu-ray] This movie is a little confusing at the start. If you have read the books you will know what is going on but if you haven't I suggest watching the movie a couple times to understand it better. The Blu-ray version as usual is outstanding when it comes to the video quality. It is a good movie and it moves rather fast. I had to watch it a few times to get the gist of what was going on but once you do you will enjoy it. I hope that they make the other two books into movies.
2,AMAZING.....,".....Amazing how they managed to completely miss the point of the book. They took all the action from the book, but left out the important information that supports the action. The movie briefly mentions Dust at the beginning...and never goes anywhere with that idea. Never mentions anything about the religious beliefs behind Dust and its connection to children and their Daemons. I personally dont see how they can make the 2nd film....because thats what it most deals with...(atleast as far as I have read into it so far.)The movie as a movie was well made....as a book to movie adaptation it is horrible. Read the book first, then see the movie! The book is WAY better."
4,A difficult book to film,This is a nice attempt. Unfortunate that it didn't make it in the box office since I would have like to have seen the rest of the books in the series made into movies. Acting is quite good though I have never much liked Tom's ex as an actor. The fighting bears are super.
4,"Not the Book, But Close","After reading all three of the books on Lyra's adventures, I still enjoyed the film.The casting and characters were well done, even in the limited plotline.For those viewers with vivid imaginations the Golden compass will be a a pleasure."
2,Tried to make everyone happy and failed,"The filmmakers tried to make 1) an original and fresh Harry Potter size franchise for the studio, 2) a film that wouldn't offend religious viewers, 3) a film that would still promote the author's atheist/anti-church agenda.1) Fail2) Fail3) FailThe result was a watered down story that appealed to no one. It felt as though the story was on fast forward for those who'd read the (much better) novel. And, perhaps to me the strangest decision of all -- probably in an effort to succeed at number two (see above) -- they didn't include the amazingly powerful closing scene of the book.Highlight of the film for me? Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby. Perfect casting.Stardust was the better film. Wish it had had Golden Compass' marketing budget.Pass on this one."
2,Has originality died completely ?,"If great CGI is enough for you, then this is your movie. I just can't help but notice that the substance of the movie is an almost well-masked DUNE rip-off. We have brass/gadget technology, seekers, a girl whom the witches prophecied to be the one, the evil older female who denies the possibility the girl is the same one prophesied by the witches. The Egyptians are the Fremen. The dust is the spice. I could go on. Add this to the familiers via Harry Potter and a poorly written script and you've got a disaster of a movie."
1,Terrible!,"This was a really bad movie. Maybe it was a better book. The Harry Potter, and Narnia movies were so much better. I can see why there will probably not be a followup movie."
1,Pathetic attempt to out do Narnia,"I was looking forward to watching a movie of this type without the ""christian"" overtones and found it to not be that good. very disappointed with both Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig but most of all New Line. Meh!"
1,Didn't live up to the hype.,"This was, quite possibly, the dullest and most lifeless movie I've seen in a very, very long time. I'm glad I didn't waste both my time and money to see it in the theater. I simply cannot imagine an adult, much less a child, wanting to sit through such tripe."
1,Rubbish,"This review is for those who hated the books but thought the concept behind it was good. If you were hoping if the story was taking through a different filter it might be good you will be disappointed. This movie was just as big of pile of rubbish as the book, if not more so. I actually lasted longer in the book than the movie."
1,No Audio Output On Blu-Ray Version,"Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-Ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-Ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-Ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-Ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale."
1,My Compass Points Away from This Movie,"I immediately concluded that this movie does not stand alone, apart from clarity that the book probably provides. (After all, something made director and screen play writer Chris Weitz think that this production would be worthwhile.) I never read the book, now I never will.This cinematic catastrophe is loaded with story-line gaps, an endless parade of lifeless characters, and general plotlessness. As a viewing experience, it is only mildly endurable for the special effects. What a cast! But it doesn't help. What a budget! But this movie makes Kevin Kostner's Water World look like a work of genius by comparison for all of the criticism it received in view of its titanic price-tag.I found myself nodding off and the movie made as much sense half awake as it did with my initial full attention. What a cinematic disaster. Anybody got a golden plot compass?"
3,Beautiful,"A very imaginative film; I like the fact that everybody's soul is harnessed inside an animal daemon. If I knew that ending is not the end of the journey, I would have waited until the next film came out before I watched this one. I am very impatient."
5,THE GOLDEN COMPASS,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! THE DISC WAS IN A PRISTINE PLAYING STATE. I HAVE WATCHED IT OVER AND OVER. I WISH THEY HAD FINISHED THE SERIES THOUGH. I WOULD AND WILL BUY FROM THIS VENDOR AGAIN.
3,Eh,"Having read the book, I can honestly say that this movie does have some good parts, but it's not as good as the book, with some big changes that detract from the movie. If the movie had been more faithful to the book, it definitely could have been better."
5,Exelent adventure/fantasy movie.,"This is new theme in fantasy, it combines the 1800's look with advance technology in everything like transportation methods etc. For another way, and maybe the reason the other 2 parts never came out (people protesting); was the use of words that in the world of the movie have a different meaning than ours, just like: demon, lord, witch..etc.People though that because the writer is atheist, he tried some how to confuse children..and other abnormalities that only closed minded beings can believe.Lots of action, adventure, suspence etc can be found is this 2 hour long movie...no matter what people said about the ""vocabulary"", is good for the enjoyment of all family members. :D"
2,"Um, somebody forgot to finish the movie...","I readHis Dark Materials Trilogy (The Golden Compass; The Subtle Knife; The Amber Spyglass)(suffered through it to be more accurate). Then I watched the Golden Compass. I was grateful that it left out a lot of the banalities of the book, but then the movie ended with about a third to a quarter of book left to go.I saw the credits start to roll and I thought ""Huh! Where's the rest of the story? WTF?""Other than that, I felt the movie represented the book very well. If only they had finished it."
2,"Great book, bad movie","Good message, poorly done. I didn't see how the story was anti god at all. I'm pretty sure the book is about choice. It basically all goes back to eve and the apple if you make it through all three books. -Original sin and all that. But I'm quite sure it's just to make you think, not to bash your own way of thinking unless you want to bash how others think for themselves. The book conveys this quite well, while the movie just doesn't flow properly and seems to lack any real personality."
1,A complete waste of time,"This movie is real dull, without much of a plot or story. The worst thing of all is that THERE IS NO CONCLUSION. A real ripoff. I guess they expect us to wait with baited breath for a sequel to finish the story? There were also some good actors totally wasted in this drivel, like Christopher Lee and Derek Jacoby. I also wasn't expecting this to be children's movie, but that is what it is. Oh, by the way, they ripoff Chronicles of Narnia. They wish they were 1/100th as good as Narnia. Even the voice of the ice bear was a ripoff of the talking lion of Narnia."
4,Decent,"Started kind've slow but then got interesting. Movie is part 1 of a 3 part trilogy and sets up for the next one....if there will be one. Movie got a bad rap worldwide due to the possible ""religious"" aspects of it etc...remember it is FICTION!Anyway, the polar bear scene is pretty sweet and looks good on bluray."
5,If you like CGI,"If you want a clean movie the whole family can watch and enjoy, this one fills the bill. If you appreciate CGI, don't miss this movie. It has some of the best CGI of any movie I have ever watched. You will have a hard time believing the animals and birds that accompany the characters in the movie are not real. The bonus DVD that accompanies the movie is almost as entertaining as the movie and if you are curious as to how such movies are made, maybe more interesting!"
2,Yawn,"As a fan of fantasy/action movie I had high hopes for this movie but actually fell asleep watching it. The story was the Achilles Heel of this movie. It was all over the place and just didn't hold together. An allstar cast could not pull this out. I am guessing this is yet another case where the movie does not do the book justice.The two things that really stood out were some of the atmospheric special effects and the acting of Dakota, who was excellent as the young heroine.But nothing can save a wandering story with lots of holes that leave way too many questions."
2,Not a good movie,"This had the potential to be an interesting movie...excellent actors, interesting story, nice special effects....but the story was missing something. It wasn't bad...but it just didn't hold my interest. I was bored 5 minutes into it."
2,Don't see if you haven't read the book,"The graphics are wonderful but the screen writer should be drawn and quartered. If you haven't read the book, or even read it recently there is no way to follow the story. I'm extremely disappointed in the movie but it did make me go back and read the book again after quite a few years. Again, the graphics are amazing and that is why I will watch it once more but from there it may go on the shelf to gather ""DUST""."
3,"Freudian fantasy for kids, marred by the *Russki* stereotype","Okay movie for a New-Age *fantasy* flick. What is interesting - the Freudian psychoanalytical theory, which is invoked in cinema again. Apparently, the magic *dust* denotes the object-cause of desire and the reservoir of libido. Since it also could mean a surplus enjoyment, it is no wonder that the *Church* (or any church-like order), at least officially, would be against it.I have a problem with the *evil Russians* or *evil Tatars* who are portrayed running some kind of a nightmarish *kids-only* Gulag installation on Spitsbergen. You dress them all like Rasputin; let them speak a bit of broken Russian and voilà - ready-to-wear agents of evil. I mean, seriously enough already with stereotypes. Perhaps kids should be spared from all this Freudian Cold-War-ish Mambo-Jumbo?"
1,Incredibly lame,"I really enjoyed the book - a character-driven fantasy/mystery.The movie, on the other hand, decided to essentially ignore the character-driven aspect of the book, and instead went for (and horribly missed) a story-driven epic.If you liked the book, skip this."
3,"Wonderful characters and animation, but confusing story.","I have mixed opinions of this film.It is both wonderful to look at but difficult to follow. There are moments of sheer magic- like the talking animals, and moments of utter confusion- which are many.The fantasy is a stunny visual collaboration, and I love the concept of animal alter-egos, but bothered by Ms. Kidman's bloodshot eyes; had no one on set ever heard of Visine?Personally, I was disappointed as I didn't see any point to it and it seemed too open-ended, I guess for a sequel. I have not read the book, but have noted reviews that say it is a polical allegory.I don't know if I recommend it or not; guess you'll have to decide for yourselves."
1,Not so good,"If you read the book don't see this movie, they did nothing but mutilate it. I amazed me on how they screwed up the time line, and the characters. But if you haven't read the book I guess it would be ok, but otherwise don't see it."
3,Good start but where's the end?,"It was a great movie for what there was of it. As stated it just kind of ...ends... As in ""There's a sequel you're missing just now"".Its always fun to see Nicole Kidman playing a role in period costumes. She carries off the role of the villainess very well. All the actors were very well chosen for their parts too. The effects were good, but a little too dark to see anything sometimes. Most of the fights in the tundra were that way. If there wasn't snow on the ground it would have been totally pitch black.Overall a good movie, that with some tweaking could have been a great movie."
1,Book vs Movie,If you have ever read the book don't EVER watch this movie. It takes the story from the book and rips it apart. Its horrible! The plot was completely twisted and flipped around. The book is amazing and there was so much story and action and it was so rich and you can see a movie in your head while you read it. The real movie is worthless. Don't waste your money when you could buy the book.
2,Rushed and disjointed,"How disappointing. The story is rushed and disjointed, trying to fit way too much material into the time allowed. Since I had read the books, at least I knew what the story was supposed to be. If you didn't read them, then forget about it.The only positives I can mention are that the movie is nice, appearance-wise, and the armored-bears are kind of cool.The ending is abrupt and unsatisying. Of course, they are setting it up for a sequal but, considering how badly this movie was done, a sequal seems unlikely...Not recommended."
1,eh...,"I just finished watching the DVD (rented). Fabulous CG -bears, rabbits, wolves, oh my! I have not ever read the books (His Dark Materials Trilogy (The Golden Compass; The Subtle Knife; The Amber Spyglass) (His Dark Materials)and after watching the movie, I am not sure that I would want to. Having enjoyed Harry Potter, Narnia, Fellowship of the Ring, this movie just seemed to steal ideas (battles, CG animals, witches.....)even Nazis.... The plot was difficult to follow, especially if it was intended for children. I briefly looked up the controversy, and frankly if the Christrian Right had just stayed quiet, I think the movie would have just died.Don't bother with this one."
2,Just plain bad,"I had heard a lot about this film being anti-Christian, blah blah blah. So, I wasn't expecting this movie to be just plain BAD. I wasn't offended at all by any anti-Christian message, but I was just offended by how horribly bad the movie was. BLEH. It gets 2 stars for decent CGI."
2,Parents Review first.,"I saw part of this on TV before I made the purchase, and did not see all of the movie. The design, computer graphics, and sceens are outstanding, but this is not a film for Christiam children. The movie is based on each person having thier own ""demon"" who ""helps them"", and leeds others to think this is a good thing."
1,Kept Going South,"This one was rife with problems. I went in wanting this to be good, but there was just nothing to make it a compelling flick. The characters are boring and one-dimensional, either evil because ""that's how things are"" or good because ""we aren't going to take this anymore!"" The film was shot with no regard to pacing at all. There are gratuitous shots of scenery just so the filmmakers could show off how wonderful their environments were. The whole thing even wraps up with a plot synopsis of the upcoming films, which runs something like:""Can we go home now?""""No.""""Why not?""""We have to find a way to milk this franchise for all its worth. There are many people out there who are craving a secular, humanistic fantasy story, and we'll give it to them.""""Oh. Okay. How?""*Explanation of inevitable plot points*""Oh. Okay.""Credits.Underwhelming, at best."
2,very frightning and confusing,"This movie was incredibly scary. The animation of the animals was also very bad; nothing looked real. There were a couple of very scary scenes involving the children and the demons. There were alot of things that seemed incomplete, like what is dust? and the magisterium was confusing as well. This was not a very good movie in the least. I do not even want to read the book now :( A big disapointment."
2,Well....uh...... here's the thing,"I wanted to like this, I really did. Lets face it, this should be almost as good as Lord of the Rings or Narnia. But the problem with Compass is that you don't care about anybody in the movie because it has been watered down (I don't know how much since I have never read His Dark Majesty.) That and the scripts weren't that memorable and the acting was mediocre (having Wyatt Earp's brother only made it more confusing whether this was Golden Compass or Tombstone.) I do gotta admit that the special effects are pretty good and Daniel Craig does look good with a beard.Go ahead and click the candy-like ""NO"" button anyway."
1,Golden Compass,"I was disappointed compared to all the hype I heard before I watched this movie. Just another fantasy movie, nothing to jump up and down about. Good acting and special affects but that's all it has going for it."
2,Too silly for words,"OK, I confess that I haven't read the book, so I approach this as a piece of cinema. It is nicely filmed and the visual effects are lush and pretty (even though some of the daemons don't look that realistic some of the time). However, I just couldn't accept the plotline, such as it was. It is, as I said above, too silly for words. Now I know that the books have come under considerable fire from the loony wing of the US evangelical community for the atheistic views that Mr. Pullman is said to have built into them and which, they said, he was trying to inculcate into children. Perhaps this explains the dilution of the story from the book into a rather insipid kids' adventure yarn. The one highlight for me was Nicole Kidman's chilling villain. Nothing else.The comments of some of the other reviewers have persuaded me to read the book, to see what might have been."
1,Fans of the book....Watch out!,"The casting for this movie was fantastic; the acting was great, and everyone did a really good job. The special effects were even good...But if you're a huge fan of the book (like me) then I'm afraid you'll find this movie to be a disappointment...I was so sad after watching it; I had waited forever for it to come out, and then it hardly follows the plotline for the book at all. The ending was cliche as anything (kids all running out of Bolvanger while the facility blows up...what?!?!?!), and it wasn't supposed to end where it did. The movie rushed into everything and left out so much that was in the book.I would have expected a lot better of New Line, especially with their good adaptation of The Lord of the Rings."
4,Golden Compass was golden,"Special effects and graphics were great. Storyline was nothing new but it never gets old. Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty."
1,Big Disappointment,"I can't believe the lack of integrity in this film. Even putting aside how incredibly untrue the film is to the book, it's just a very poorly made movie. Ichk."
3,Don`t Take Away The Childrens Demons!,"This was a very daring children`s movie in a way. You will have to see it first parents and decide for yourselfs ahead of time. Especially if you are Christian. Plant Earth being relative to the movie world; the word demon carries such strongly negative contonotations. Besides that however, it is as good as any children`s movie, with some cool special effects."
5,Golden compass DVD,"Based off of Northern Lights by Phillip Pullman, this is an amazing movie showcasing the book. Book is better and no ending like the book, that was a bit disappointing"
5,The Golden Compass-A Lot Better Than Narnia,"The Golden Compass is an entertaining and exciting movie. It is a lot better than Narnia (personally I did not care for Narnia at all). It has a great story, great special effects, and memorable characters. I prefer a talking Polar Bear over a talking Lion anyday! So if you want a great movie, this is for you! The acting is alson great! And as usual, Sam Elliot is awesome!A great film for the whole family! Buy it and enjoy!"
1,Poor sound,"This review will strictly address the Blu-Ray version of this movie. This version is produced in 7.1 channel sound. When played through the sound system of my TV (only a 4-year old Toshiba), the sound was full of static at numerous points in the film. Every adjustment I could think of to work around the problem failed. The 5.1 channel extras disc played just fine. The static ruined what could have been an enjoyable movie. So unless your TV and sound system is really current, you could wind up with a bad sound experience too. I have no complaints at all about the video presentation of the film. The visual experience was terrific."
5,"""THIS TIME"" this is the one to get!","Troy Shondell had only 3 songs on the pop chart & only one b-side.Of course the ONE song he is known for is ""This time"" b/w ""Girl after girl"" #6 in 1961.His other two songs are ""Tears from an angel"" #77 in 1961,and ""Iland in the sky"" #92 in 1962.Those 4 songs are here in this 15 track c.d.I had some of these other songs when I was a teenagerthat I bought at our local dime store out of the 'cut out ben'.It was quite a pleasant surprise to see that his music made it to a c.d.!The c.d. includes a very nicely presented 12 page booklet about his music and career.Included with the track listing is the chart # and year of release.This is good easy listening early 1960's music.Shondell was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1939.Here are the original sound recordings owned by Everest Records,and licensed to Acrobat for this compilation.Made in England, 2006."
5,The Caste War of Yucatan,"Nelson Reed's ""Caste War of Yucatan"" tells the story of an obscure Maya rebellion in Mexico in the 1840's with vigor and a style that makes this history come alive. This is a history that most Yucatecan ladinos didn't want told for many years. But in a masterful way, Reed has put life into one of the most interesting corners of the history of the Americas...the only successful native American rebellion...one that ended in disaster for all concerned.The story covers the 53 year struggle of the communities of Yucatec Maya that rebelled against intolerable oppression in 1847 and whose events snowballed to an all out race war which raged on and off until its flame was finally extinguished due more to illness and exhaustion than to the resolve of the participants. This gripping tale of battles and desperation has enough horror and action to cause the reader to ponder who these Maya are that today greet the Cancun visitors with warm smiles and hospitality.Mike Reed"
1,rather unbalanced,"althought this book is relativly well written and candid it seems as though the author does to full understand the culture and often misrepresents it. the pictures (although black and white) are quite nice and the descriptions of the elite in the major cities such as karachi and lahore are close to true but not always agreeable. I visited pakistan for my friends wedding a few months ago and this book contradicts most of what i learned about their culture and ceremonies. what i found most misrepresented was the issue of sexism in pakistan. the author mentions how women have less authority than men but conveniently forgets to mention the respect and facilities they are awarded as mothers,sisters, and wives. all in all i felt this book isnt the best way to go if you really want to understand the country and the people of pakistan, this book isnt the best way to go."
5,Fredro Starr Firestarr,"Fredro Starr from the Onyx is now back solo & better than ever cool beats & heavy rhymes feat. his cousins Sticky Fingaz & X-1 & some others like Capone'N'Noreaga, Ice T, Tha Outlawz & some other cool Rappers Including Jill Scott in the Soundtrack from save the last dance."
4,Slammin',"If you like smoothly out of control Ornette Coleman with a touch of John Zorn fire, you're going to love this album. Lehman is a first class horn player who strays far from the beaten path to form progressions and soundscapes held together by one of the tightest rhythm sections I've ever heard. Mark Dresser's bass lines thump and check out the 8-count line on track 5 (Rison): infectious to say the least. Pheeroan akLaff's drumming brings easy comparison to a certain Mr. Tony Williams, and unfortunately I'm not familiar with anything else he's done aside from this album--I'm sure he's got his own sound, but ranking him with Tony Williams is about the best compliment I can dish out. His work on track 5 (Rison) is superb, as well. If you've never heard of Steve Lehman and his Camouflage Trio, buy this album NOW."
3,It's ok,With all the great reviews I expected this product to have a better seal. There are some uneven parts on the lip that prevent a seamless close. I used it one and have not used it again. It is cute though.
1,Broken upon arrival & unable to use,I was quite disappointed when this arrived. It was not noticably broken from the front clear wrapping but was broken on the back side which to me indicated that it was broken prior to shipment. The packaging material was also not appropriate for something this delicate.
1,Broken,"It was broken when it arrived. Would have been nice for them to have replaced it. As it stands, I'm afraid to order another one. It might arrive broken also and I'd have to pay again to ship it back!"
5,You'll like this one,I stumbled accross this neat little item on Amazon and it is just what I've been looking for. Keeps soft butter fresh and at hand. Good size and comfortable to use. I love my butter keeper!
4,Shipping charges to U.S.,"Thanks to a review on this butter keeper I checked and found the shipping charges to be more than double the normal standard shipping costs. I believe this is because it ships from Canada and the reviewer mentioned that the shipping was almost as much as the item. So, a very big ""thank you"" to that reviewer! I ended up buying one that ships from the U.S. and therefore has standard shipping charge. Otherwise, it looks like a very nice butter keeper. It is dishwasher safe, well-made and easy to handle and use."
5,Great Butter Keeper,The butter bell is always handy and keeps the butter spreadable. I gave it as a gift to family members and they love it.
3,Not that great,This product is more of a gimmick than a useful tool in the kitchen. I also worry about it's sanitary safety for everyday use. I will use for company but that's about it.
4,"Painful to read, but worth the effort","After hearing this author read her own work on NPR I was hooked-I had to read it. Tightly woven within this brutally honest portrayal of just how a mother copes after losing her two children was the painful realization that one simply has no choice. While it was at times very difficult to take in just how much the death of a child must affect a parent, I could not put this book down.I found myself thinking what a good mother this woman must be to the two children she now has. Indeed she has made no attempt to hide the fact that the ones she lost through tragic circumstance existed and she aptly illustrates the importance of keeping the memory of loved ones alive by continuing to make your life with them a part of the present.Any empathetic person who wishes to try to grasp the pain of another's grief would benefit from this book. The knowledge gained this mother's excruciating experience can surely help someone out there...."
5,"A new sound, not merely Ratt the Next Generation","While I loved the debut album of Arcade, this was an excellent followup.""Hot Racin'"" and ""Angry"" were the gems of the album. The sound was edgier, rougher, and less pretty. But it worked.Unfortunately, Sony Records didn't promote it at all. This was too bad as this album was a great counter to the grunge garbage."
3,Stephen Pearcy playing in the Arcade,"If you are just finding this band then you need to give their debut album a listen first. While still a good album, A/2 just doesn't do it for me like the debut does. Stephen Pearcy is a great Metal vocalist, we all know that, but none of the songs on this album really grabbed my attention like those on the first record or stuff put out by Ratt. Still a good record to have if you're a die-hard music collector like myself."
4,The CD that got me into King's X,"This is the first CD that I bought of these guys and it's sill my favorite. The sound is a little rawer and I read in an interview where they said that the sound on this CD is close to the sound that they get in concert. ""Dogman"" ""Pillows"" ""Black the Sky"" and ""Pretending"" are among my favorites, but they are mostly all good. The soungwriting shows a maturity not usually asscociated with heavy bands and they have a much better sense of melody than a lot of bands in this genre. Pinnick's souful vocals are a standout and Tabor's guitar playing style is unique. Gaskill's drumming is solid and he knows when to add the appropriate accents. Overall, a great CD and a good place to start."
5,Excellent...thick hard rocking album.,"The new production made a difference in one of my favorite bands, Kings X. It brought out the hard edge in them. Thicker basslines, harder kick drums and faster licks from Ty. I strongly recommend this album to any Kings X fan, and even if you're not...after this album you should be."
4,A Great Hard Rock Album,"I bought this album many years ago after hearing about what a great band King's X was. I wasn't disappointed and I actually feel like this is one of the top hard rock/grunge albums of the 90s. Most of the songs are very mellow and sad but if you are into that kind of stuff then you will definitely like them. Some of my favorites are Dogman, Pretend and Fool You."
4,"Don't dog it, man.",This disc is just as good as the four released before it. Anyone who thinks otherwise needs to take a step outside of their Fantasyland of King's X only being about Sam Taylor. This band has shown that it can transcend and innovate with another stellar producer.
4,Why pay more if this works,I bought this for my parlor guitar 'cause this one is a little bit smaller than the regular classic acoustic guitar case. It is only half of the other parlor guitar case price. Why pay more if this works.
1,Guitar Case,I thought that it was a five-star case. That was why I purchased it. Only problem. I never got one. I was sent a refund with no explanation.
3,Not an up front man,"I love Michael Bloomfield on the Paul Butterfield Blues Band albums. The PBBB, Bloomfield and John Mayall changed my whole music appreciation towards the blues. However, Bloomfield up front leaves much to be desired. His vocals [are not good], but his guitar playing remains magic. This album highlights his greatness and his limitations. The early tracks show his ability on guitar but not on vocals. The PBBB tracks show the gulf between him playing alone and playing in a tight unit where others contribute. After that, he produced some good music but never again reachs the heights of when he was with the PBBB. Check out 'I've got a mind to give up living' on East-West for his greater achievement."
5,"Mikey, We Miss You","If you liked Super Session, Electric Flag, or many other smokin' guitar WhiteBoyBlues bands, this CD is essential. B'Field is possibly one of the finest guitars of all time. This particular CD has a lot of incredible tracks, and very few mediocre ones. This one is a must for those of us who love a killer guitar.JohnThe HardLuck Cafe Rockin' Blues Show,Brownwood, Tx."
5,FANTASTIC !!!,A beautifully acted and recorded story that is superbly inspirational and very touching at the same time. One will never look at butterflies the same after viewing this fantastic DVD. A wonderful contribution to anyone's library and a story you will watch more than once.
5,Fantastic movie,"Feel good Movie- Well acted no violence, no swearing can't say enough about the movie - watch it every year and still enjoy it"
5,AWESOME movie!!,Great message about learning what is most important. A must see for all! It is a family Christmas tradition in our home.
5,fun,this is a very good movie for the entire family. i really enjoy this move a lot. have fun watching it.
4,I love this movie,"This is a heart-warming movie that teaches a spoiled, rich kid values he had lost. He learned how to let go of the past, and he learned how to love again. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a clean, family-based movie."
5,Wisdom prevails,"This wonderful, inspiring movie focuses on the superficial in the world and brings a young man to an understanding of what is really important in life. The twists and turns keep you guessing and the final result is beautiful! This is one movie that everyone embarking on life should see!"
5,Best gift and find.,I had been looking over a year for this item and want to thank Amazon for the hookup and find.
5,Great lessons to be learned....,"I love this movie! It is all about finding that money does not buy the most important things in life, that hard work is important and that even the most selfish person in the world can learn to care more for others than himself."
5,Review for the movie The Ultimate Gift,This movie is WONDERFUL!!! We need more movies like this one. It has lots of great values. And lessons for life. The actors are very talented. I would recommend this movie to everyone!!!! It is FANTASTIC !!!!!
3,The Ultimate Gift,The dvd arrived ahead of schedule but was damaged. I contacted the supplier immediately and received an email that a replacement dvd would be shipped. Can't ask for better service than that.
5,Huff,This movie is great. It is for the whole family and has some great guidlines for life and what is important and non-important. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.The Ultimate Gift
3,movie,"not as good as the booktook too many things out from the bookdidnt get the same ""feeling"" as I did from the book"
5,The Ultimate Gift,This is one of the best movies I have seen. There is agood story line plus a good message. It is very cleanwith good acting.
4,Great Movie,Saw this movie in theatres. Just as awesome watching it at home. Makes a great gift; family film.
1,Predictable in the extreme,"I'm definitely in the minority among viewers, but to me, this movie was like a Hallmark channel movie of the week reject.It was totally predictable, with more cliches and stereotypes than I would have thought it possible to jam into a single film.The huge gaps in reality alternately annoyed me (a child going through end stage leukemia and chemo is totally healthy looking and perky) and made me laugh (a month in the Texas sun doing hard manual labor and the star doesn't even get a little sun burned or calloused).The end moral of the story seemed to be that if you have enough money you can do some good in the world (yet, it never addressed the fact that the money was made by exploiting the earth for oil and raising cattle, among other things).There was nothing remotely ""spiritual"" about this maudlin and manipulative film. I found it a total waste of two hours."
5,"""The Ulltimate Gift"" dvd","""The Ultimate Gift"" dvd is absolutley the most incredible movie I have every watched. By many it might be considered LIFE CHANGING. So far, I have purchased 17 copies, which I am passing around the office, friends and neighbors. I ask them to watch the movie and if they agree with me, to pass it along to some of their contacts. If I get the dvd back, fine I will forward it on to someone else. If I do not get it back, I assume that someone has gien it on to someone else. If there ever is a MUST SEE movie, this is IT."
5,the ultimat gift,the message about giving of ourselves to help others during times of trouble and trial is straight forward and is a blessing to me.
5,Great Family Movie,This is a great Family movie and is very inspirational. I will enjoy this movie many times with my Family.
5,INSPIRED,I READ THE BOOK AND WAS INSPIRED BY IT. WHEN I HEARD THEY HAD A MOVIE OUT I HAD TO ORDER IT AND I AFTER I SEEN THE MOVIE I REALLY LOVED THAT TO.
4,Nice movie but I expected a tear jerker,"This is a nice feel good movie but I was expecting to cry- in the good way. It wasn't that moving though, yet I feel that if written slightly different it could have raised alot of emotions in me. Overall, a very nice story. I would recommend it as a mood lifter, a family film, or if u are the type who just loves a nice positive movie."
5,Highly Recommend it!,"This is a wonderful story about the meaning of life. It will remain with you forever. While some parts are predictable, the movie has alot of heart. It is a good movie for people whose world around GOD."
5,DVD The Ultimate Gift,"This is a wonderful movie that we enjoyed as a family. We ordered this one as a ""Stocking Stuffer"" gift for our daughter. It came well packaged and promptly. I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a good story, well acted and without profanity. Gene"
3,inspirational,"as soon as you start to watch this movie you already know how it is going to end....... but it doesn't matter, 'cause it will get to most of you anyway"
4,Nice family movie,I really enjoyed this movie. This was the second time I've seen this one and cried again the second time.
1,Seriously? So Bizarre!,"We don't get it! We loved The Christmas Card, November Christmas, but this movie has absolutely no character development, is disjointed, and really poorly done. For as much as we like to support ""family movies,"" this one is weak all the way around. Quite phony, the young girl character is really bizarre, and relationships don't develop, they just all of a sudden ""are."" So far out there. We have no idea how this gets the high ratings it does."
3,Cliched ending,"The movie has an interesting storyline. A rich (dead)old man tries to reform his young spoilt, tarnished (but with innate goodness) grandson to succceed his business and inherit his zillions. The tasks the grandson was given to perform were the best part of the movie. His relationship with the only friend he made was touching and funny. Nonetheless, the movie weighed too heavily on its moral, its message to the world - which made it too sentimentally sweet. A fun watch. No regrets."
3,the ultimate gift---bad,"I watched this film completely. I sooo wanted to like it. I'm a movie buff and love James Garner, so I thought the film gets 3 stars for him and his preformance: otherwise it would get less. The story is predictable, weak and very lame. I found NO inspiration here. If you want to watch a good family film watch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or a cartoon like ""Antz"". Rent this film instead of wasting your money buying it."
1,Stupid,I watched it on TV and believe me I would never buy this stupid thing!!!!!It does not even rate a one star!!!!
5,Great movie and book!,"A religious teacher at my previous Catholic school of mine read the book in class and we also got to have an interview with Mr. Stovall. Mr. Stovall helps people realize that you have a lot to be thankful for in life. He's blind and very smart in intelligence, has a lot of wisdom, and is eager to share. A very nice man, sweet personality, and inspires all."
5,The Ultimate Gift must see,"Excellent story and movie. A little different than how I remember the book but equally as good. Really puts ""life"" into perspective. I think ALL students & their parents should be given the opportunity to be encouraged by this story whether the book & or movie. We need more movies like this."
5,AMAZING-- A MUST SEE FILM,"This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. I loved every moment of it. Jason Stevens, played by Drew fuller, goes to the reading of his grandfather's will expecting to get nothing but what he finds is that his grandfather has an ""ultimate"" gift for him. He has to do a bunch of different tasks to recieve his inheritance. He decides to do as his grandfather wished and goes through each and every task to finally achieve his ultimate gift. This is a warm, heart felt movie that anyone can fall inlove with. You begin to identify with Jason Stevens even though he is a self-centered rich boy as he goes on his journey to find the ultimate gift. This movie is by far a definite must see film. Don't waste anymore time contemplating whether or not this movie will be worth the time because it is and it will be."
4,Ultimate Gift a family winner,"A family movie - good acting - familiar facesThere isn't a single car chase nor a shoot-em-up in the movie, but it held the attention of both my husband and myself through the entire story. There are many ""gifts"" illustrated in the movie. Be sure to watch the ending credits."
5,"James Garner, one of my favorites",I've always loved James Garner. I loved the message and I loved little Miss Breslin.
5,A movie for all ages.,"The Ultimate Gift is a wonderful movie. How refreshing, to watch a movie which is not only entertaining, but is appropriate for people of all ages to watch. There's a good lesson to be learned here. I dare anyone to watch The Ultimate Gift without getting teary eyed one minute and bursting out in laughter the next."
5,Awesome!,"This was an awesome movie. You've got to watch it. My friend let me borrow it and then I quickly went out and bought my own copy from Amazon as a gift for someone, but had to watch it again before I did send it off. I really enjoyed the special faetures also. They're definitely also very much worth the watch! The movie was more than a pleasant surprise!"
5,Loved it!,"The movie seemed to get off to a slow start, but I think this is primarily because I couldn't get into the introductory scenes in which greedy scumbags demand their entitlement to an inheritance. Once the plot is set in the introductory scenes, the movie seems to move right along and features excellent performances by the primary cast. I think this is an excellent movie for the entire family, although parents may want to preview the movie to ensure all scenes are appropriate for their children."
4,The Ultimate Gift,"Four stars for great family viewing. I liked the message of leaving a family legacy of value, not money. I recommend it to any growing family."
5,Fantastic movie,Teaches us what's really important in life and making good choices. Saw at the movies and just knew I wanted it to share with others.
4,True story,"This is a nice ""warm fuzzy"" DVD. A truly touching story especially those whom are born with a silver spoon in their mouth are arrogantly expecting to inherit a HUGH fortune from their rich relative. The jest of the story is heir could only receive his inheritance by accomplishing several steps that makes him humble learning not everyone is born with silver spoon."
3,DVD Dud,The video only worked half way through the movie and stopped; however amazon did work quickly and sent another right out when i told them of the problem.
2,Do you have any wine for this cheese?,"My wife and I watched this movie at a family Christmas gathering, and we were shocked that they took this movie seriously. The best way to describe this film is ""a simple movie for simple minds."" Perhaps this should be moved to the After School Special category for 12 year olds. If all you watch are movies like this, then you will like it. That being said, please do not make family members who enjoy good movies sit through it."
1,Superficial and disappointing,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband we were expecting to enjoy. Instead, much of it was not logical (the reformed Jason coming in a huge stretch limo). The characters were stereotypes. Only young Emily was interesting and dimensional.The DVD included a long trailer for ""Amazing Grace,"" which told of the work against slavery of wonderful characters over a period of decades. It is truly a great film, and this one is nowhere near its quality."
1,"""The ultimate Gift""","Hi All,This movie, ""The ultimate Gift"" is a great movie. That is why I wanted to buy it. However, I was very dissappointed with the quality of the DVD (The Ultimate Gift) that I received. The sound is totally off and it is hard to understand. This DVD was a surprise gift for my Wife and the results were not as I hoped they would have been. Thanks to the poor quality of this DVD.Sincerely,Giuseppe Ciaralli"
5,Can listen over and over and over,Not a song on the CD I don't like. Please put your CD's into sheet music for those of use who want to play!!!Thanks
4,BodyOpus is the one,This book is really one of the best books written about fat loss. Not by any guessing but by easy to follow methods to help any bodybuilder or fitness head decrease body fat and preparing for contests if thats your thing. I got hold of this book a few years ago and at the time the low carb diets were laughed at in Australia and now they are all the rage. Dan was truly ahead of his time but his calculations and his science that he applies are truly amazing. Yeah there is all the knockers out there who will whinge about constapation and head spins. How about knocking the results- wont hear too many of those. RESULTS. Any way I vary the diet and it suits me and is easy to follow. The drug section is very detailed also especially in the diretics and thyroid area.Also there is no index on this book but you can find it easily on the web.
2,Budgies,"I followed this book to the 'T' and felt like the bottom of my budgies bird cage the whole time. Ketosis is (for me anyway) not a place you wanna be. You stink, you go to the toilet about once a month, you suffer from total lethargy and you can almost feel your arteries hardening. I don't know how Dan died but if he followed this diet I can guess why.The upside is - well there isn't one. I dropped hardly any body fat on this diet and the carb loading phase only merited nominal strength increases - and no more than I would have gotten on any high caloric bodybuilding diet. Save your arteries, the abysmal moods and workouts and stick to the basics. John Berardi (a real PHD) has some excellent diets which are far healthier and in my humble opinion, far more successful. At least they have been for me. Check him out or others of that ilk.RIP Dan - I hope they are serving vegies up there."
4,Product exactly as indicated,"Book arrived very shortly after order was placed and in condition as stated, some underlining and highlighting as indicated but in all, book in very good condition. Excellent value. Thanks"
4,Great read: Information is a little dated.,"Dan Duchaine, rest his soul, had a real knack for writing. When I received this book, I read it like it was a cheap novel. Duchaine could really relate with his readers and his clients.There is a considerable amount of valuable information in this book. If you follow the diet, you will get results. HOWEVER; several of the things Duchaine recommended at the time of writing, have since been further researched and are no longer recommended.If you are going to purchase this book, which I feel would be an excellent addition to any fitness/dieting library, I would also look at Lyle Mcdonalds Ultimate Diet 2.0 and Ketogenic Diet books. Also, don't bother buying a glucose monitor and testing your blood sugar like Duchaine recommends...it's not an accurate way of telling what your blood sugar looks like...stick to Ketostix."
3,NAVIGATE THE NOISE: INVESTING IN THE NEW AGE OF MEDIA AND HYPE,"USEFUL FOR AN INEXPERIENCED INVESTOR. PRIMARY POINT IS TO FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM AND DO NOT RESPOND TO DAY TO DAY EVENTS COVERED IN THE MEDIA. SOME USEFUL INFORMATION ON WHICH STOCKS TO BUY AND WHEN. GOOD BUYS ARE FREQUENTLY NOT THE ""BEST"" STOCKS BUT RATHER THE ONES GETTTING THE LEAST ATTENTION FROM ANALYSTS AND THE MEDIA."
2,"Ballroom Basics, Vol 5 Bollywood Dancing","The teaching is very slow and very confusing. Not a fun video to learn from. Probably will just toss it, not even worth giving away."
1,Save your money ...,I bought one of these for myself and my sister. She really likes hers but mine caused much static electricity. I never had any static until I used this. My sister really likes hers so ... go figure! Perhaps it will work for you.
3,"Good, but not great","As mentioned in a previous review, Mr. Allmand's narrative is not strictly chronological. Roughly the first half of the book is the chronology of Henry V's life (yes - Henry dies half way through the book), while the remainder touches on various aspects of royal life and a description of the late 14th and 15th centuries (for example, the second half of the book discusses Henry's military establishment, his relationship with his family, court life, and the Lollard movement).Personally, I did not care for the bifurcated structure. I believe Allmand could have incorporated the themes from the second half of the book into his chronological life of Henry in a seamless manner. As written, the book is disjointed and can be difficult to follow in some places.Overall, this is a good read, but not great."
1,Pretty but it doesn't keep time...,First the good. It's a very nice looking watch. Now the bad. The talking part keeps decent time. The hands are virtually useless. They don't keep time at all. I had a new battery installed. No change. Very disappointed. Would not recommend.
4,Nice looking watch but the buttons are too soft,"This is a nice looking watch but I found the following three small issues in order of my priority:- The buttons around the watch are unusually soft and end up getting pressed accidentally all the time whenever my hand brushes against anything. This causes time and other settings to be changed unknowingly.- The volume on the watch is very low. This is not such a big problem once you get used to the volume. I initially found it very low as compared to the previous watch I had but now I find the volume to be ok and non intrusive.- It would have been nicer if the talking function did not prefix the phrase ""the time is"" before telling the time every time. Too verbose for me.Overall I like the watch otherwise and wear it everyday."
5,This is for ONE SIDE only.,"Perhaps I didn't read carefully enough, but this sway bar end link is for one side only. Order two if you need to replace both sides. Moog makes great suspension parts and these are no exception. Great quality!."
4,Decent kit,"The instructions could have been a bit more helpful with torque measurments, but they seem to be holding up. Must have if you're replacing the other mounts with poly."
3,The moon falls into the Atlantic ocean,"""The moon falls into the Atlantic ocean and the majority of humanity survive to start a war over the acquisition of new territory -- the point of such novels is not scientific accuracy, but a comment on contemporary society or humanity in general.""It is a is a SATIRE on UK complacency in the face of impending war.Published in 1940"
4,Practical and fun for regualr and special needs students,I have used this music for many students int he past 10 years. I especially like to use it for students with motor skills difficulties. You hear the music and the instructions and then it is recorded without the instructions so that you can perform the activitiy as part of an assembly at school or perhaps at a parents night and have the instructions blarring. Special needs/EMH students REALLY enjoy the involvment and have a sense of belonging and peer-ship! The music sounds up to date and the instructions are easy to follow and not presented too quickly. There are many repetitions and the students are able to follow the simple activities. There is a leaflet included to show you the moves when the movement is not clear. This adds nicely to any PE program when the gym is not available and can be intergrated into your Music/Movement units as well.
4,"pass the beanbag, please...","When I started teaching preschool in 1992, I had this on record. It is great that it is on CD now. I can't say that I use all of the songs, but I have literally worn out ""Pass the Beanbag"". I can remember numerous days when the playground was wet, too hot, or the kids where just acting wild- when I would put this song on.""Pass the Beanbag"" is kind of like Hot Potato. Any size group of children sit in a circle on the floor. When the music stops, the person holding the bean bag has won the game. I have had MARATHON listens to ""Pass the Bean Bag, until EVERYONE in the class has won. It can really help kill time when you are waiting for kids to be picked up at the end of the day - an there isn't anything to clean up!"
2,Died after about 3 months,"Maybe I just happened to get a bad one.Anyhow, I bought a brand new Cendyne External 56K and it died about 3 months later.I verified it's demise with diagnostic software that ran loopbacks and such, on the modem. It failed 2/3rd's of the tests.I run EVERYTHING connected to my PC (except the laser printer)on an UPS unit, both to ""clean up"" the 110 volts incoming to the PC and to avoid over or under voltage situations.An external modem is great. Lots easier to setup under win98.After my cendyne died, I bought a Multitech modem (business line) and have never had any problems with connections.Cendyne went out of business in 2003, I believe.So if you buy one of these, do it on a credit card that will provide an externded warranty of it's own.Since Cendyne probably can't help you if you modem dies."
5,Best Eagles Compilation Ever,"Well, NFL Films has done it again. Their recent anthology on the Philadelphia Eagles History is a must for any fan of the franchise. There's something for every fan, young and old, given they cover the entire reign of the club from their beginnings in 1933 to the demolition of Veterans Stadium.As a long time fan of the team and their history, I was happy to see first time video on such great players as Pete Pihos, Norm Van Brocklin, Steve Van Buren, Concrete Charlie and such great coaches as Bert Bell, Greasy Neal, Buck Shaw.The DVD set is complete with additional special features including profiles of Wilbert Montgomery, Reggie White, Veterans Stadium, the Fog Bowl...the list goes on and on.Do yourself a favor and get this if you are a fan of the team.....if for no other reason, to see some Cowboys QBs getting their heads taken off."
1,Buyer Beware,"Suzuki Seijun's ""A Tale of Sorrow and Sadness"" is a very important film in Suzuki's career. A return to filmmaking after a ten year blacklisting from the controversy caused by his masterpiece ""Branded to Kill"". One would think that a film this important from such a prolific director would have been given a better treatment, even a mediocre treatment but here on the Cinema Epoch release there are a few distracting problems.While the film is still very much watchable only half of it seems to be subtitled. Whole scenes will go on without subtitles and the ones that are present are timed poorly.There is even an error on the plot synopsis on the back cover of the DVD with the use of the word ""too"" when ""to"" was the proper word. This error hints at the unfortunate subtitles and essay included on the disc.If you are a Suzuki Seijun fan this DVD is at the same time a must have and a heartbreak."
4,great corrosive and surreal satire,"This is a great, very underrated (in Japan as well as in the USA)and SUBTLE satire about media,sports (specifically pro golf),sex in the suburbs, obsessed fans, advertizing, etc. The cast is excellent, the images are often surreal and the story maddeningly elliptical (in a good way). It has been a while since I watched the DVD and I do not remember some of the egregious problems with subtitles (although they aren't great) mentioned here (though I think I have the English-subtitled DVD that came out from Hong Kong, not the American release)"
2,Great while it worked. Garbage now.,"Bought this for my 93-year old mother-in-law. She has macular degeneration and cannot see clocks well, so we bought her this ""talking"" pendant for her to carry around with her. She really depended on it for about 6-months and thought it was great. However, the talk button stopped functioning right after the paltry, 6-month, warranty expired. MaxiAids refused to replace it. Looks like they're taking advantage of an aging market and not standing behind their products...avoid."
4,Alison's Legacy,Alison's Legacy is a well written and carefully researched novel that allows the reader to experience life as it was in the eighteenth century. Many readers will find their own beliefs in reincarnation being challenged and expanded as the author leads them on a journey not only into the past but across lifetimes. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and am anxiously waiting for the author's next one.
4,can be had elsewhere,"Yet another Wailers and Perry cd (not that that's a bad thing) under the guise of Tosh and Marley.There are plenty of cds out there that cover this period, and there are no new surprises on this cd that can't be had elsewhere.just compare these best of cds, and find which one gives you the most bang for your buck prior to purchasing them."
4,USA is not Germany - I received my Hacker's Blackbook,"Hello you guys in Germany and Switzerland.I received my products without any problems (USA).The reason may be, that Mr. Walter Voell is not responsible for this ENGLISH book (the delivery and the support). I ordered the book (+cd) at www.hackersbook.com/info.php. No problems...The book is perfect for beginners (Before reading I've been a ""lamer"".). It's written as an interesting report. Easy to read. Sure, you have to read more than this little book, to become a good hacker (or security expert). But after reading this book I know what I have to do know...And hey: Know my computer is much safe than before..."
1,Seriously this Book is Never Exist,I have tried to contact this owner but can't get through even using a phone call.The no given is fake. I try to contact through email but no respond. I have sent email so many times but the result really frustrated. Luckily i saw the comments at amazon regarding this book and several website that show many people that not satisfied with the owner of this website and they never receive any book from this cheat website owner.
1,think twice about getting this book,"omg, i can't get through to the company by phone or anything, i think that, trying to order this will set you back $20.00. Final Statement, think twice about getting this book"
1,Do Not Waste Your Time and Money-Scam,"No such book, website contact never returned email or calls.Do Not Order!!!!!"
1,"Betrüger im grossen Stiel ""Walter Voell""",Achtung: hier wird ein Buch angeboten welches von Walter Voell(spezialreporte.de) angeboten jedoch nicht ausgeliefert wird.Weitere Informationen über seine Betrügereien finden Sie auf der Site: http://www.besttoplists.com/000-ss16.htm
1,Do not buy this product,This product is not what is shown in the image. It is only a bottom pad. Not a chair with a back like what is shown in the picture. Do not buy the product it is not what is seen and the seller is extremely hard to work with on returns.
4,Nice,Our granddaughter had her first doll party with this table and chairs and loved it. Right size for her and her dolls
1,Bad Quality,"The table set is undurable. One chair was broken on arrival. Another chair was broken several weeks later when my 2-year-old kid was sitting on it. Today, after 2 months' use, there is a crack on the corner of the table. Bad purchase for the price."
4,A perfect gift,"I was very pleased with the Lipper ABC table and chair set. I could not find a pattern that was somewhat educational on top of being fun for my Niece. This was perfect. It arrived in just a couple of days and was very easy to put together. My only ""wish"" is that I would have liked 4 chairs instead of 2.I highly recommend this item.MJ from Westchester, NY"
1,Total crap...,Don't waste your money. I got rid of the little pests by first finding the hole where they were coming in and cramming it with steel wool. I haven't seen them since. But it had NOTHING to do with this device. I had it plugged in for about a month and they were still coming inside just as often. It didn't appear to even phase them.
1,Did not work for the mouse.,"I bought this electronic device to get rid of mice, placed it in an outlet in my kitchen about three weeks ago. To test if this worked I put out a small bowl with ""rat bit"". Checked that bowl today and found that is mouse has topped the ""rat bait"" with dog food. Obviously this mouse was not deterred by the noise emitted by this device."
1,Not sure it works!,I bought a unit for the garage because the mice were around. Doesn't look like it has helped much because they are still there. The unit is functioning properly.
1,Doesn't repel a thing,"When we moved into our house we realized we had a roach problem. We tried as many things as we could to try to get rid of them. The Pest-A-Repel hasn't worked from the day we got it. We've seen roaches sitting right in front of the device, seemingly unaffected. I would not recommend this device to anybody who has roaches because it does not work."
2,Cinderella,Not too bad but really not like the disney clasic of Cinderella.I didn't think the girl who played cinderella did the character very well.
1,Best movie ever made until watched!,"This was the best movie I ever saw, I dreamed. Then, the nightmare began as I awoke to discover that Cinderella was actually an African-Filipino-Irish-Korean fairy tale! This is truly one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen. Bad plot, acting and scripts. Poor job."
1,Pure Garbage,"You are all idiots, except for the editorial review. I am not going to waste more than a few sentences to say that the ONLY worthy version of this classic is the orignal 1957 version that is now available on DVD. Brandy has no business being anywhere near a stage/camera or anything that has to do with entertainment. The whole production is a disgrace and an insult to Rodgers and Hammerstein. This drek makes the movie version of ""Annie"" look like ""Casablanca."" The only reason I am giving it one star is the computer won't take anything less."
3,"3.5 stars, Not the best but not the worst either","I think the Julie Andrews version is the best but this is far better than the 1960's version which even as a kid I didn't like.Brandy is sweet, but I like it more for Whoppi, Bernadette, Whitney and Victor Garber. Jason Alexander was annoying though and unapealing as the valet/butler.Ricardo Montalban's son was also very sweet. Not a bad version like I said but Julie's is still the best one."
1,This is really funny!,"Forget Austin Powers! If you want to be tickled by the absurd, watch Whitney Houston try to become an English Princess! A whole multicultural cast as funny as dogs and cats marrying each other. Fried ice cream, mixed with lemon sugar, tart, dumb, and mouth puckering stupid. Watch this when you are really tired, it will wake up your senses and make you, well, kind of sick!"
1,"Should not be watched while driving, may cause drowsiness","""Ten minutes ago, I saw you"" should be the theme of this aberrant version of Cinderella, 1990's style! Ten minutes is all anybody can take of this mind numbing debacle. The cast of this version should be brought up on charges of crimes against artistic humanity. Seriously, what was Disney really expecting the public to do with this schizoid version of Cinderella? All I can say is be careful in viewing this confusing version; it should not be watched while driving or using heavy equipment, for it may cause drowsiness."
1,I feel sorry for all my peers who grew up with this version,"The 1965 version of Cinderella is what I grew up with and love, and when I saw the Brandy version I was disgusted! It's all glossed up and doesn't have the warmth and innocense of the older version. This is supposed to be a play, and this one doesn't make the movie theme work. The new songs are not at all good, too. I feel so sorry for my peers who have only seen this version! They have truly missed out in the wholesome 1965 Cinderella with the elegant Lesley Ann Warren. In general, the Rodgers and Hammerstein Cinderella is absolutely wonderful. I'm 15 and I still watch and know all the lyrics!"
2,2 STARS FOR THE SINGING.........,Why they remade the Rodger's and Hammerstein's classic from 1965 I'll never know. Why they cast Brandy as Cinderella I'll never know. The singing is good. That's about it! The rest is cheesy. Message: You can't improve on perfection so don't even try.
4,Favorite Video,"My daughters are 2-1/2 and 5 and they both love this video. It is also my favorite of all their videos. Most children's videos these days have at least one scary or traumatic part. Cinderella does not. It is appropriate and thoroughly enjoyable for all ages. Paolo Montalban was wonderful. When he looks at Cinderella coming down the steps it makes you instantly believe in love at first sight. The step sisters were extremely funny. My daughters cheer everytime at the end when they are locked out of the wedding. Bernadette Peters and Jason Alexander were also excellent. The rest of the cast totally overshadowed Brandy, who was supposed to be the star. Her lack of experience really shows, but the rest of the production was so wonderful you really don't care."
5,"Exceptional creativity, visuals & talent - don't miss!","I think this production of Cinderella is fabulous! The cast as a whole has tremendous energy. Who knew Jason Alexander could move so well? I particularly enjoyed Brandy's performance as Cinderella and loved her version of ""In My Own Little Corner"". The sets were incredible; the music updated and inspired. The disregard of racial backgrounds was inspirational as well as fun. I just found out this is now available on DVD and ordered a copy in addition to the VHS tape I already own."
1,"SPARE ME, PLEASE!","Once in a while you'll see something that is so stupid you're quite not sure what to say about it. This version of Cinderella fits the bill. Awful acting and singing. Whitney Houston is a has been, along with the gawdawful Brandy. Don't waste your time on this."
2,Poor Packaging,"Although I received the product in a few days, the seller could have better packaged the item. The dvd played good, but the dvd case was smashed, when I received it, due to poor packaging."
1,Cinderella- the one not to see,"Few who have grown up on the now famous Leslie Anne Warren, Stuart Damon 1960's era Cinderella can watch this version without encountering serious nausea. Although the props are great and the music performed superbly, watching this fiasco is like hearing Marilyn Manson performing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. In an attempt to make a multicultural rainbow out of a classic, the absurdity of the effort becomes apparent. In 100 years, college professors will make this a ""must see"" for those studying ""deviant cultural trends of the 20th century"". Buy it for study, but not for entertainment."
2,"Poor. Miscast. Good job by Houston, but overall: poor.","Huh? B. Peters as the step mom? Goldberg as the queen? Didn't they switch those two. Bernanette is much too pretty to be the step mom, while Whoopy would be perfect (if she could act mean).Jason Alexander as the royal aid was also awful. The man is funny, but he can't sing. This is a MUSICAL. It comes across as not funny and not musical.Too many of the songs don't carry the action, they STOP it.When Whitney (Fairy God Mother) comes on (42 minutes into it), it does get a lot better. She is very good. But it's just too far into this mess to make it enjoyable. Rent it. Don't buy it. Even better, get ""Ever After"", and see what Cinderella can be. Exciting, Funny, and entertaining."
1,Not a great production,"Unfortunately, in reviewing this production, one tends to compare it with the Leslie Anne Warren version of the 1960's. The earlier version was enchanting. This was a very weak attempt to modernize the story. It really felt flat and strained. Visually, the many different races of the cast caused visual conflict. Generally, a poor job overall."
3,Not your mother's Cinderella,"I can't bring myself to give it anymore that 3 stars. I adore the effort to bring a multi-ethnic cast, but some; not all, of the acting was weak along with the singing. I applaud Jason, Victor, Whoopi, Bernadette (very cruel) and Paolo for every second they were on the screen, however I found Brandy to be a bit weak although believable and sincere and Whitney(who has a magnificent voice) to be over-bearing. It seems since Whitney had wanted to star in a remake of this when she was younger that she was now overcompensating and inflating the fairy godmother role a bit. I guess I'm just used to the more sedate fairy godmother who let Cinderella shine since it is her story. The sets were grand and fantastical as a fairy tale should be, but I still prefer in '65 version, plain and pure as it was."
4,Great film!!,"This version took a big risk and, eventhough its tough to see, it was a woderful film. True, Brandy doesn't have the best voice for R&H but her Cinderella was a stronger character and more believable, instead of the usual weak Cinderella. Having great B'dway stars like Bernadette Peters, Jason Alexander, Whoopi Goldberg, Victor Garber, Paolo Montalban and the two step sister brought life, woderful acting, and wonderful singing to the film. Even though Whitney Houston wasn't the best choice for the Fairy Godmother she produced the movie and you have to admit she can sing. The sets, costumes, and special effects were amazing and brought out the story book mood, something the other versions never did and R&H's score was beautifully brought back to its full glory that just wasn't in the 1965 production. Though the film has a few flaws it's a great film!!"
5,Rebirth of a classic,The 1964 version with Leslie Ann Warren was always a favorite of mine until I saw this one. Brandy is not a great actress or singer but she did a good job with both in this movie.Natalie Deselle was equally charming as the plumper step sister.I wanted to own the DVD for the behind the scenes. It was fascinating to watch how the sets were designed and the processes.The 1964 version was wonderful but as an African American this one is closer to my heart and something I can better relate to.
4,A well performed modern remake of the classic fairy tale.,"This version of Cinderella, for me, is by far the best one I've seen. Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as the prince's mother. Her singing isn't quite what it was in the Sister Act movies, but her comedic timing was at it's best. With Whitney Houston playing the fairy godmother and Brandy in the role of Cinderella, their pop-diva sound combined with the rich lyrics of Rogers and Hammerstein make for a fantastic musical experience. But the best performace of all is by none other than the legendary Bernadette Peters playing the wicked step-mother. This movie has a splendid musical cast which makes up for the not so splendid acting by Paolo Montalbon and others. All in all, if you are a fan of musicals, you will appreciate this movie and find yourself singing the lyrics when you are alone!"
4,Great Musical,"Enjoyed the earlier (older) version with Leslie Ann Warren and didn't think a remake could match it--was wrong! Not disappointed with this multicultural version. Here's probably a twist though--out of all the characters in this newer version, enjoyed Bernadette Peters the most. She was outstanding as the evil step mother! The ingenious pairing of the two step sisters (one black, one white) was also a good match and also Whoopi Goldberg as the queen. Excellent performance in both singing and acting from the prince."
5,The music made this movie.,"It was a step away from the traditional, and well put together. The characters were perfect for the story line. The movie pulled you in to this imaginary world, from the marketplace opening, to the palace ending. It was very well done."
5,The Best Cinderella,"I've loved this movie ever since it came out when I was in middle school. It was so surprising to see a cast for the movie that was composed of people of many different races. I think the acting was wonderful all around, especially Whitney's. I still watch this movie all the time!"
5,Cinderella,"All I can say is that my 3 year old granddaughter simply loved this movie! The songs are wonderful, beautiful lyrics. Loved seeing Whitney Houston as the star she was once, so beautiful and talented."
5,Cute show!,The music is wonderful - and it's just a fun adaptation of Cinderella. We enjoyed the magic of this classic.
1,cinderealla,we thought it was a disney movie and in cartoon form....what a disappointment we were very unhappy and are afraid to by more dvd's
2,"Poor. Miscast. Good job by Houston, but overall: poor.","Huh? B. Peters as the step mom? Goldberg as the queen? Didn't they switch those two.

1,Poor remake of a classic,"I suppose they thought they would make a version that everyone could relate to. I miss the old version, but the only one you can find is this one. I would like for my children to see the old version, the real ""Cinderella"" and not this badly made imitation.Keep this version and the old version available and I think most people would choose the old version with Leslie Warren, even if all the people in it are of one race. My kids need someone to identify with too. My kids can't identify with this version Cinderella."
1,It's just like every other princess movie!,"By SeanIf you're looking for an amazing movie, do not see Cinderella. It is about a girl that loses her glass shoe that is a princess, and the rest is like any other princess movie. The movie is exactly like the book. Do not watch or read it!When I was watching Cinderella, I looked dead. If you're looking for a horrible movie, get Cinderella. It is enough with the book, now they have a movie. Me and my dad were so bored we decided to plug our ears and cover our eyes.I would rather clean up after elephants than watch this movie. If you like princesses, then you'll like this movie. You can find it at your local disc store."
1,This was really a bad movie,"I was very disappointed with this version of Cinderella. Thge singing was awful, and the actors really stunk. It was a flop!"
1,ugh!,"I rented this video for my daughter and she left the room after 20 minutes. I thought it was very weak, strange in its casting and horrible, almost unrehearsed acting. I do not recommend it."
1,Impossible things are happening everyday!,"As the words of the song go, this movie is a testimony to that theme! Prior to seeing this movie, I thought it would be impossible to make a movie this bad using highly paid artists. ""Impossible"", I thought. Then I saw this rendition of the classic Cinderella. This redefined the phrase bad movie. Awful acting and singing. Poor job overall. Not recommended."
5,Magical,"Paolo Montalban made the most wonderful Prince Charming!! With his dashing good looks and his mystical, sweet, melodic voice. This guy will be going places. Bernadette Peters is the perfect stepmom."
2,Less wonderful,"I am seeing this again -- right now -- for the first time in a while. Atrocious acting. Some good singing but otherwise, horrors, what have they tried to DO to this show? I'm not talking about the multiracial casting, but the sheer lack of chemistry, or joy, or whatever it is making this seem forced and fake.And whoever thought the Leslie Ann Miller version was atrocious, let me just say as a 60s teenage girl that the words ""Impossible Things Are Happening Every Day"" were taped across the top of my bedroom mirror for years. Thank you."
5,Believe it or not,"I watched this in a foreign country and came to realize exactly how much the world has changed since the date of it's airing. Beside it appearing on television in my childhood (which makes me nostalgic enough), the songs are indeed catchy and the multicultural cast can at least pull off the gig.Yes, it wasn't perfect. Yes, it was overdone in a lot of ways. However, I think it embodies a lot of the spirit of the late 1990s and the pre 9/11 world.Look at what's on TV now, and compare, and THEN complain."
5,"Wonderful, colorful, and cheerful","Brandy made a beautiful Cinderella. Whitney Houston did a great job too. I loved this movie. The singing and dancing made it more colorful and entertaining. I would say that this is for the young and old, not just for kids only. END"
5,The best 'Cinderella' to date.,"I can't say enough good things about this movie. Amazing cast, beautiful costumes, fantastic performances by all. What I love most, being a parent in a multi-racial household, is the broad diversity of the characters. I love that the different races and ethnicities come together to make families and couples and that not once are these differences mentioned. I've always loved the subtle, yet powerful message that this sends to my kids----that people are loved for who they are, not for what they look like."
5,Great,"The movie meets my expectations and I absolutely love it! One of my most favorite movies to watch, so glad I found a DVD version"
4,musical Cinderella,Bought the DVD because my VHS tape was no longer working. This was shown on the wonderfull world of Disney many years ago. It is a musical version of Cinderella.
3,DVD Roger's and Hammerstein's Cinderella,Good Service.Responded very well and efficient when DVD did not play.Replacement was fast and in visual order.
5,Entertaining Colorful and Comtemporary,"Cinderella is one of my favorites fairy tale and I really enjoyed this version of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella. It is an entertaining, colorful, comtemporary version of a classic tale and classic Rodgers & Hammerstein music. It's one of those remakes where either you love it or you hate it and I love it."
4,Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella,"The DVD of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella is beautiful. The costumes and the sets are gorgeous looking. Brandy as Cinderella and handsome newcomer Paolo Montalban as the prince are wonderful. Whitney Houston tends to be a bit over the top as the fairy godmother, but she did produce the movie! The score by Rodgers and Hammerstein is excellent ranging from the romantic ""Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful"" to the comedic ""Stepsisters Lament."" All in all this is an excellent DVD."
4,A very lovely film,This is a lovely film. The music is great and it is very fun to watch. The DVD doesn't has that many special features but the movie is worth buying it. Very happy with it.
3,This work shows how race still matters in the US.,"I read a book about Black women's media representations. The author wrote, ""Why is it that whites don't want Blacks to dismiss classic fairy tales as Eurocentric, but when a multicultural cast is shown in 'Cinderella' few white households watched it?"" Now I am reading about book called ""Adopting Maternity."" The author quotes a white adoptive mother who said one of her relatives asserted that she would never let her children watch Brandy's Cinderella because it showed black-and-white dating. She said dating with Asians would be acceptable, but not with Blacks. I mention this to say that the negative reactions to this harmless production show how much race still matters in the US, despite the successes of a Whitney Houston, Obama, or Brandy. It's surprising how a work meant for children can pinpoint the very real prejudices of adults to this day."
1,Not worth your time!,"The movie had wonderful cinematography, cool costumes and beautiful props. But that's as far as it goes.. Brandy made an awful Cinderella. The girl can sing but she can't act!!! Whoopi in this movie was not Whoopi Goldberg. I think it was an impostor. I had a chance to be a great movie but it failed...big time!"
3,Wonderful Bernadette! Talentless Brandy!,"This could have been such a wonderful film. There are many outstanding performances including Whitney Houston as the fairy godmother and Whoopi Goldberg as the Queen. Paolo Montalban makes a good prince, not great, but good.Far and away the best performance is given by Bernadette Peters as the wicked stepmother. She is the only one who manages to present a fully fleshed out character. Also ""Falling In Love With Love"" is the best sung number in the movie (even though it is not r&h;). She sings excellently and also acts at the same time (wich in this movie is a novelty). She comletely steals the show.There were two very unfortunate performances. Jason Alexander is NOT funny playing the doormat to the king and queen.One of the worst performances I have ever seen is given by Brandy. She cannot and should not sing in a musical! Also, her acting is absolutely painful!This movie, however, is not without its charms (thanks to the supporting cast) and is worth a look."
5,A find for a niece,"Had given a VHS copy to my young niece some time back, and then the VHS player died. She kept saying how much she missed this version and managed to find it on DVD here. On time delivery, and at a great price."
4,Cinderella,"The Movie was great to view again though i did find the film to be streched across the screen, i tried fixing this with the different views but i found nothing worked. But it worked and that is all i really wanted."
5,Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella - 1997,"As a young black girl, most if not all the images I saw on televison and movies of princesses were all white. While the shows were certainly entertaining, they gave me--and I'm sure, many other Americans--the sense that little black girls didn't really have a place in fairytales. I can't tell you what it means to me (and other ethnic groups) to see a major Hollywood production using multi-ethnic performers. And as a mother of Scottish-Jewish-African children, it's wonderful to see a musical in which color-blind casting is used. That, combined with pretty decent--I'd say stellar--production values and updated sets, costumes and performances, makes for a show that will certainly appeal to new generations--a wonderful example of diversity for everyone. Who knows--perhaps the kids of today will feel as strongly about this version as the adults do about the Julie Andrews production from decades ago."
3,Love the good...ignore the bad,"Substance value: CEntertainment value: A+++I LOVE this movie. I first watched it when I was like...8 or 9. Yes, the acting is laughably bad, but the camp adds to the fun. This movie is not meant to be taken seriously, so why even go there? It's a made-for-tv-movie for children! The fact some of these reviewers are complaining that the multiracial cast is too ""distracting"" or ""confusing"" is complete nonsense. Um...LIFE is multiracial...so yeah, get over it!Rent it. Love it. Good times. :)"
4,Heartwarming family classic,This is a heartwarming family classic favorite with a plus! We love the multi-cultural aspect of the film; makes it more interesting visually. The costumes and set are extraordinary with vibrant colors and the music is contagious.
4,Uniquely done musical,"Frankly, I'm surprrised at how much effort this was put in this made-for-TV version of the hit Disney animated classic. A multiracial cast was set, casting Bernadette Peters as the deliciously nasty stepmother, a lovely Brandy Norwood as Cinderella and Victor Garber and Whoopi Goldberg as the king and queen.The movie is uniquely done, lavishly done, fine songs and chereography. The movie itself is a work of love, but it'll never compare to the glitzy, emotion-driven musical power of ""Moulin Rouge."" But the movie is special in its own way.Give it a look, it's a special musical."
5,"Excellence in Cinderella, the newest twist on a classic","This movie, which i have viewed several times on the television, was a grand piece of cinametography. The plot was of course the standard in the cinderella series and it was even more complimented by Brandy. Some people believe she doesnt have the voice for Rodgers and Hammerstein, well to them i must say you have no taste. Brandy's musical performance was brilliant and stunning and I hope to see her in future musicals of the same sort.Whitney Houston was also a wonderful addition to the cast, adding a little more Star image to the film. Cinderella was breathtaking and i would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys music as well as cinematography. Buy it now or you might regret having missed out on this Video/DVD gem."
2,Maybe if you are from Montana...,"Cliched but harmless. I would choose this novel over a cereal box for reading material. At best, a beach read. The romantic scenes are good for a chuckle and if you enjoy high school sports, the play-by-play of basketball games is likely the best writing in the book. The two-page epilogue by Mr. Lee explaining how he came to write the novel would be better as prologue. It is unaffected and sincere, and made me wish I had enjoyed his effort more than I did."
2,A basketball romance novel,"My son lived in Ovando, MT for 9 months (population 50?) and I had the best steak of my life in Seeley last summer. I think that the author describes the landscape and small towns quite well. The story is okay, albeit very predictable (see Friday Night Lights). But, I started speed reading after a while because of the cliches and multiple adjectives, not quite a romance novel but close."
1,Aren't I further than this?,"Drags. Repetitive. I have bought inexpensive books from Kindle and been pleased, but this is not one of them. I am one fourth of the way through and it feels like I have been reading forever. Very depressing setting and characters."
3,Left me wanting no more!,"Whew, by the time this book was over, I was very tired of the whole basketball season! I really enjoyed the first pages of this book...it was entertaining to meet the quirky, engaging characters and to root for the unlikely underdog team. But, the book dragged on, and I got weary of the whole thing. If you're looking for a feel good book about basketball, you might enjoy this lengthy volume."
2,Trite,"This book was highly recommended to me, but I found it to be trite and predictable. I read the entire 500+ pages hoping the 'end would justify' the book, but was very disappointed."
4,It's like going home,Great book I grew up in small town Montana and it was fun reading a story with familiar places and faces.
1,Sooooooooooo long and predictable,After reading the first 150 pages and skimming most of them I finally put this book down for the last time. It is long and predictable. The story and characters are shallow and inauthentic. Very cheesy! Very disappointed that I bought this book.
1,Enough Exposition!,"This is a book that will likely be made into a movie. When that happens, my advice will be, ""See the movie!"" I forced my way through this trough of meaningless exposition because the book was selected by my book club. It's predictable and populated by stock characters whose motivations and plights were the cause of much eye rolling. I have nothing against long novels--in fact, I prefer them--but this one is emphatically not worth it."
5,Blind your ponies,"This book had something for everyone. If you are a high school teacher, coach, educator, love Montana or like books about relationships this is a book for you. My husband was reading it in hard back as I was reading it on my Kindle. He is a retired educator and coach and absolutely loved the book!."
3,An editor might have caught this,"When I read the author's bio, I was anxious to read this book as I grew up in a small town in Montana. I liked the characters and liked the story line okay; however... the entire last third of the book is mainly basketball play-by-play with every sport analogy imaginable. So I skimmed through most of it. My biggest beef is this - and I get the fact that this is fiction - but a town and school the size of Willow Creek would be Class C, not Class B. And all of the opposing teams that Mr. West referenced were Class B. That lost credibility with me."
5,Excellent read!,This is a wonderful story of interesting lives in a small Montana town who overcome numerous challenges. The story centers on the local high school boy's basketball team consisting of a total of 5 boys and their coach. The author skillfully weaves all aspects of life into one season of excitement and disappointment. Everyone I've talked to that read this book loved it.
4,A Superb Read!,"Blind Your Ponies is a must read even if you don't like sports books. I love basketball and found the on-court narrative fast paced and masterfully written; as if you are right there with these struggling players. The only drawback is getting through his writer's school technique of using three similes in a row. One, or maybe two, would have made the point. I have purchased three other books by this author and can't wait to start reading. I have suggested it to my book club."
5,Blind Your Ponies is West's best yet,"Blind Your Ponies is one of my favorite books; I will read it again in the near future, as the characters are so real that I want to revisit them and their challenges.As a retired teacher from a school in which the elementary and high school were in the same building and every student was known by name, I was able to warm easily to the school environment and the students.I think anyone who enjoys Jan Karon's The Mitford Series or who is or has ever been a teacher will enjoy this book."
5,About the underdog struggles,"This book, while centered around a small basketball team in a small town in Montana, is really about people overcoming all odds. I dislike sports, but that did not keep me from reading this book in two short days. It simply is the best story I have read in a long time. The characters are very interesting, most with some type of baggage in the background of their life. I laughed many times while reading this and read parts out loud."
3,"Great color, but not too bright",This is for sure one of the whitest bulbs I have ever had.But not as bright as I needed.
3,Imperfect but appealing,"This is a collection of Kubler-Ross's lectures on death. Her pleasant personality comes through consistently, but her thinking here is less-than-rigorous. For example, she claims that a boy who died of a shark attack knew that he was going to die before he ever entered the water. Similarly, Kubler-Ross uses her expertise on dying as a license to lecture her readers on barely related topics such as child-rearing and everyday behavior, and to put forth comforting but vapid New Age views. I greatly admire her more scholarly first book, ""On Death and Dying,"" but this later collection is best left to readers who are unable to process serious material."
5,A loving book dealing with a tough issue we all face,"I have read all of her books. I began in my 20s and continued throughout the years. I used her information to help me deal with my dying mom. I emailed her and her sons wrote me back telling me of her death a few years ago. I learned so much about death, how to approach life with joy, and how to love sincerely. I still reread her earliest books and marvel at what an incredible human being she was. I believe she contibuted as much to the beauty of living and dying than any other person ever!"
3,She knows this.,She has a very great understanding of it all. In the end I have to admit that I might not be as smart as she is and would prefer a more konservative understanding of death.
2,"Interesting Idea, Poorly Developed","Leiber combines two interesting ideas, actually--the absolute impossibility of proving that other minds exist, and the mass-production of human minds in the modern world. Unfortunately, the story itself is full of coincidences, narrow escapes, and other melodramatics. And the explanation of how the few ""alive"" people can co-exist with the ""dead"" world is not very convincing."
3,Decent but nothing special,Fairly enjoyable. It was a very fast read and really didn't draw me in like some other books. Its a decently enjoyable book for a one time read.
1,Disappointed,"I've used 257 MB SimpleTech flashdrives for years, so figured I'd go nuts and spring for the 8GB Bonzai. It worked as it was supposed to...for about 2 weeks. One day it was fine, next day no computers will recognize it/run it when plugged into the USB port. I'd been disengaging it properly, so I can't figure out why it went bad. After a coule of weeks it was useless to me, and the ""customer service"" on the SimpleTech website is a joke. I give up."
2,No so great.,"I ignored a couple of earlier reviews because every drummer is different and treat their sticks differently. I have had my sticks for 2 weeks and the tip broke right off. Trust me, I am not an abusive drummer and the tip broke right off as it was dancing on my Ride Bell. The sound was excellent as I gave them at least two stars, but every drummer looks for a strong stick. That is all."
1,These do not last!,These sticks claim to last 3 to 8 times longer than regular wood sticks. THEY DON'T I played with them for about 20 minutes and the tip broke off of one stick. I play with my wood sticks for days on end without breaking them. I will not buy again unless proven otherwise.
3,Disappointing,"Season one was awesome. Season two was a real let down. Chris Carter, the creator, maintained artistic control over season 1. Here, season 2, he was busy with the X-Files movie so he let Glen Morgan and James Wong run this series into the ground. The show went off in a totally different direction and by the time the season ends I wonder how Chris Carter can salvage a season 3. I understand Carter resumed control in season 3, so I will buy it next.I particularly disliked the way Glen Morgan and James Wong made fun of their own show. The episodes ""Jose Chung's Doomsday Defence"" and ""Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me"" actually ridiculed the Millennium show. This is exactly why I gave up watching X-Files and never bought any of those CDs: because Morgan and Wong have no respect for their audience. They think we are idiots and are laughing at us.Buy season 1 and season 3, but skip this one."
1,How did this happen ?,"I was shocked when I saw the episodes of the second season. I would say the first season was one of the best things to be aired on TV ever. How come they just throw all that down the drain ? You really don't know what to think during the episodes. ""Is it a comedy ? Oh, look at at satan and his friends having a chat.Am I supposed to laugh or amuse myself ? And now, is it a serious episode ?"" Not to mention the lack of darkness so well conveyed by Frank Black in the 1st season. To sum up, the second season left a lot to be desired. The only thing I can do now is re-watch season one."
1,This season blew - watch for yourself and see!,"I was indeed a huge fan of the first season, and looked forward to every episode. Season two was very different. It was like a boat without a rudder. I can imagine a bunch of college guys getting together at a party and writing ideas on a bunch of pieces of paper, throwing them into a hat, then each guy there pulls one out and is tasked with writing an episode based on whatever bizarre topic was scribbled on the scratch piece of paper. There was a complete lack of continuity; the soul of the show was lost. I am surprised the show made it through the entire 2nd episode without being canned. I have not seen any episodes from season 3. This is of course my own humble opinion. I certainly think everyone should watch it for themselves and come to their own conclusion."
1,Very outdated gothic thriller,"Millennium is like Criminal Minds but goofy. When it came out on TV years ago it was actually entertaining and creepy.When I watched it on DVD the other day I could barely finish each episode without almost falling asleep. The show came across as cliche and monotone. The acting is monotone and forced. The plots are so similar to one another and focus around the same old dark and spooky themes.The main character Frank Black (Lance) is always muttering under his breath and psychoanalyzing everything in annoying detail as if I am supposed to be freaked out by that? He does that in every single episode and it gets lame and tired fast (and Lance is an awesome actor btw).Keep in mind I am a fan of the X files seasons 6 and 7. Also I appreciate horror, sci-fi, and thrillers. This show just doesn't cut it."
3,Series almost lost me but realed me back in,"This series has a new creative team at the helm and it shows. The tone and story telling are lost and all that was built up in series 1 is squandered, luckily tehy last 5 or so episodes miraculously get the series back on track with solid story telling and characterisation that ends up being the best episodes so far."
5,WOW!,"All the reviewers thus far have said so much of what I would have expressed, so I will limit my review to simply stating:I am absolutely thrilled to be able to own and watch what is one of the most incredible, moving, mind-blowing, entertaining, thought-provoking, heart-stopping, scary, and lovely shows that have ever graced our television screens.Kudos to Chris and Lance and all the others who made this such an amazing piece of brilliance."
3,If you have older children....,"This CD is slow paced. Some songs which are familiar should go at a faster tempo. If you are a teacher and need to use it for 4th-6th grade you can't! because the tempo is just too slow. This is a CD whose pace was made for younger children. For example ""Mexican Hat Dance"" and the ""Virginia Reel"" should be faster but aren't because they are designed for a younger audience. Not too young though. Listen to the samples though and decide as a teacher if it would fit your children's age group."
3,"Better than expected, but not great.","Having trouble trying to find a dance DVD for school age girls, I bought this one on a ""lesser of two evils"" approach. No dance DVDs that sounded good had good reviews, but this was sounded better. It's not great, but the kids like it. I suggest doing the step by step before doing the dances so the kids know what to do, because during the actual dances they focus on the dancer's heads instead of feet often and don't show you the steps until the dance is over. In the step by step they go slow so kids can get the steps down and keep up during the full speed dances. Great music and fun, once you get the dance moves down. Not for kids who are not patient."
2,just competent,"These are all covers of the originals, which is to be expected. They are slow, as noted. What isn't noted is that they completely fail to swing. My wife (a grade 3/4 teacher) just got this CD and we're very disappointed. Her class will think it's the squarest thing they've ever heard and they'll be right."
4,Sweet Memories,A wonderfully factual and entertaining account of the WW2 war in the Pacific. Brings back fond (and not so fond) memories of life on a heavy cruiser.
5,Wow great movie for the early generation of cartoons,transformer is one of those movies that bring you back to when you was a kid. children now and before when the cartoon was around will definitely enjoy this movie cant wait till the second one comes out.
5,Best movie of 2007!,"Transformers is not only a trip down memory lane for those of us who grew up with the cartoon, it's a surprising twist that makes these retro characters cool for today! WOW! The effects are unbelievable!"
4,Transformers,Ordering and shipping was easy. I haven't opened it yet because it is a Christmas gift for my nephew.
3,It kills time,"Transformers was a movie with some interesting special effects and CGI, but the script was pretty boring and I never felt like I could really sympathize with the characters because they seemed so driven by a plot. A lot of the characters were also ""types"" instead of feeling very real. It had an interesting 80's feel to everything though, and that was kind of fun."
5,great!,"This movie was awesome, I loved the special effects. you site down to watch a movie like transformers just to watch giant robots beat each other up! :)"
4,Kids,My Kids loved it when they went to the Movies to see it. This was one of there Christmas gifts. I would recommend this for young and old who are into Sci-Fi
2,Transformer Movie,"As an adult viewer, I thought it was way too noisy and too ""busy"". I found that it was difficult to hold the 5 yr old boy's attention that it was purchased for..I think the movie was a waste from my opinion, but then I was not buying it for my use"
3,transformers,"The movie is pretty good, and the effects are fantastic. It is disappointing to find that the sole purpose of this movie, as well as the cartoon its based upon is to revitalize interest in the transformer toys, not to mention todays movies' social propaganda. I guess it worked. But the movie is O.K."
5,Awesome Movie - But not so good for younger kids.,I enjoyed this movie. I grew up watching the cartoon as a kid and loved how they made this for us 30 year olds. However little kids watching with me were a little afraid. I have told them not to worry and that cars will not come to life. I guess what I am getting at is ... Use better judgement than I did and follow the PG-13 rule. I will next time when GI-Joe makes it to the big screen.
3,Loud and proud,"Technical masterpiece, mediocre film. Decent extras, beautiful audio and video transfer. This film is really only worth owning for the technology and spectacle of it all."
4,A Surprisingly Effective Movie,"I didn't expect much from Transformers. That's not to say I had no expectations. I hoped for a film faithful to its sources and action packed. I got something quite different. It wasn't as action packed as I thought, but that worked out prefectly. It works. The story is quite nice, and even though some parts and characters are superfluous, it's an enjoyable film.Shia LaBouef has fun with this role. The whole cast seem to actually be enjoying their time, but Shia definitely rises above the source material. Josh Duhamel also helps tone down the action movie cliches. Although he's pretty mucha walking cliche, he helps keep a base of reality in the feature.THe DVD set is outstanding. A commentary from Micheal Bay and plenty of featurettes on this two disc to keep you interested, especially for hardcore fans.Though it has many missteps, and some implausibilty, Transformers is one of the better blockbusters in recent years. Recommended."
4,Trans Formers,"Pretty good movie, special effects although a bit long sometimes, are good too. My best enjoyment from this film is that the good guys are doing all they can to Defend Freedom and The American Way"
5,Too Awesome,This movie was awesome and a dream come true when it came out. Amazing special effects and some funny stuff. It was just cool and still is. Only the third topped it. If only Revenge of the Fallen was on par. :(
3,movie night,"my son loves transformers and the library was out of this copy, so it filled in in a jiff, amazon works well, i just wish he could watch it more than once."
4,Neat Little Movie,"This is the second Transformers movie and a michael bay film at that. I would have said two strikes and you're out, but it turned out to be better than I thought. I agree with an earlier review. The script was kind of ""meh"", in terms of plot, but at least the characters, both human and robot, were strong enough to carry the film. The Bumblebee character was the most convincing, albeit a camaro in this movie versus the Volkswagen Bug from the cartoon series in the 80s. The Air Force got their hey day as they advertised the C-17, A-10, F-22, AC-130 Spectre and the B-2. Also L.A. Air Force Base and Hollowman AFB got their stab at Hollywood acting.Better than I thought it would be."
4,A good job at adopting the Transformers franchise,"While this movie wasn't perfect (can't see much when the Transformers duke it out, tries to be funny too much) I think they did an admirable job. This movie could've been a lot worse but it's pretty enjoyable.It's always cool to see Optimus too."
3,Transformers fun but crude/tacky,Most of the previous reviews of this film are accurate about it's interesting storyline and special effects. Even the acting is reasonably good. The problem lies in the unnecessary use of tacky suggestive dialogue or simply crude language. PG-13 ain't what it use to be and any parent of a 12 year old should see this movie and deside for themselves if it is appropriate before buying it. The annoying point of this is that the offensive items are completely unnecessary. They addnothing to the story and could have been left completely out and what you would have been left with is an interesting film for all ages.
3,Entertaining.........,"I love invasion movies, and this one starts off pretty good like all other good movies..good suspense,...good sound. The adult level of themovie goes down a knotch when the transformers starts talking, but heyyou get used to it and yes sometimes it looks like a car commercial it can still packs a punch and can be watched several times."
5,Xformers!!,"Ok, I was an enormous fan of the original cartoon, and the animated movie. Yes, I cried when they killed Optimus Prime. I was seven. Yes, I was mad that loser Hotrod got the matrix instead of Ultra Magnus. Yes, I am comfortable with that. I am enlightened.What was I talking about? Oh yeah.... this movie was awesome. Anyone who thinks that G1 fans will be disappointed needs to have their heads examined. Obviously I wasn't I expecting a Godfather-esque cinematic masterpiece. Actually, I was expecting a cheap Hollywood POS.This movie was MUCH better than I thought it would be in every sense. I expected to be mildly entertained.... I was EXTREMELY entertained. I was beside myself. Great film.... will go down in history. At least among me and my nerdo friends."
5,It's exciting movie!!!,I watched this movie and it was exciting and fun. Also this movie was great. The movie lovers will like this movie and I like this movie. This movie made nicely done.
4,Who would have thought,I used to watch the Transformers cartoons with my sons when they were growing up. When I saw the publicity for the movie I was not sure I would like it but I must say the special effects are awesome. Great movie
1,I'd had high hopes.,"They ruined it. I watched the movie Transformers to see transformers, not some airhead chick stretching out over a car engine. Sexuality was what we all loved about the original cartoon, right? Right? No?The Sector 7 agent was a joke; no high-level government agent would be so silly and stupid. Plot? Lame. Shia Labeouf? Also lame. In addition, ***SPOILER ALERT*** they killed off one of the best characters. Lame.Some of the transformers themselves were cool, and some of the fighting was cool. The rest of the movie was garbage. After seeing it, I am quite content to never watch the sequel.I'll give it this much: It probably wasn't as bad as ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra""."
3,i missied something,"maybe i need to watch this movie again. i saw it when it came out and i wasn't that impressed with it, i was kind of bored."
1,Come on! Are you kidding me?!?!?,"This movie was f***ing awful. Another loud, obnoxious Michael Bay crapfest. It took a promising premise and shrouded it in the most idiotic plot imaginable. Giant robots fighting each other over a pair of eyeglasses? Also, matching wits with a chihuahua... and losing? (Typical dialogue: ""That rodent lubricated on my foot!"" Har, har.) These robots are just as dorky as their names: ""Optimus Prime"" sounds like the name of a steak restaurant, and are the bad robots supposed to be intimidated by ""Bumblebee""? It's loaded with cardboard-cutout characters reciting stock dialogue and tromping through the same old Bay routine plot. I defy anyone to point to anything in this movie that isn't just a barely disguised recycling of things we saw in ""Armageddon"" or ""Con Air."" Sure, there's lots of well-done action scenes, but couldn't Bay have tried at least A LITTLE to make the whole experience a little less painful and redundant? Challenge yourself, Michael!"
1,no humans please,"This movie should have been about giant robots. If you want an emotional film then go ahead and explore the emotional lives of the robots, but no, we end up exploring the boring banal lives of some teenage twits.Total disappointment. There are action films where the plot gets out of the way so we can have fun. There are action films where the plot and the action work together to make a great movie. Then there are movies like this were the plot gets in the way and totally ruins the fun of the action."
1,YAWN!!!,I bought this for my son who is nuts over the Transformers toys. It didn't even hold his attention for 5 minutes. The husband and I tried to watch it also but were bored to tears. If you like sci-fi type stuff you may be able to withstand the deluge of laser and things but we were not.
1,Conservative Christians Beware of Transformation of Values,"One conservative web-site presented this film as wholesome and entertaining with some action violence and nothing more than a kiss on the moral scale. Well, this is not really the whole story. We had to turn it off without finishing it because of the never ending innuendos and crudeness. One Christian movie review web-site lists this as ""offensive""--this is being too kind. The absence of actual ""bedroom"" scenes does not make a film fit for Christians. Don't let biblical values be transformed into those of the world. If you have conservative biblical values, stay away; certainly don't let your kids have free access to this moral cesspool of a film."
2,Wasted Opportunity,"They couldve made a great film to stand up there with the Star wars and the umm star wars. They couldve made a smart film rich in mythology. They wouldve made as much if not more money but instead they made a garbage movie with stellar special effects. The storyline sucks, the focus is all wrong. There is so much wrong with this film its hard to know where to begin, but my guess is you would have to startw ith Muchale Bay. he should really just be a 2nd unit director who just does the action sequences. I could go on, but why bother, they certainly didnt bother taking this movie seriously, just another dumb blockbuster tryingto get by on special effects."
2,Lame film in disguise,"This feels like a lot of juvenile farting about in return for 10 minutes of action. It's all too CGI to be impressive, and the teenage subplot is a regular snoozefest. For very wet days. Or read a book.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
1,"No ""hi-def"" audio!","If you have access to a good dvd upconverter, the picture is near hd dvd quality. In addition the movie does not have a ""lossless"" track. While DD+ is better than DD that the DVD has, it's not really worth paying the extra money for the bump in sound."
2,"Technically great, but still sucky!","Yeah, yeah, it's Transformers, what do you expect? I expect it not to suck!Whatever.The reason I purchased this film, yes I purchased it, was to show off my home theater. It's a reference disc, no doubt about that. The picture quality is outstanding, and so is the sound. Especially the SOUND!The story blew, the acting was godawful, and the whole Sector 7 bit was atrocious. This goes down as one of the worst movies of the year. Funny how this makes a ton of money, and great double feature films like Grindhouse make nothing.The film is long, and I would say only 30 solid minutes are devoted to the action-considering the film is almost 2 1/2 hours. I pretty much had my finger on the FF button.It's only in my collection, because it's a reference disc of the highest caliber."
2,not again,well this is another movie I bought that didn't work skips and stops I had it in the dvd all night and could come in every few hours and see another freeze frame but I am supposed to spend more to send it back to get another one nope I'll just biyte another one from them
1,1 Star for the Theatrical Reviews of the Movie and NOT Reviews of the Actual Product,"Amazon, Amazon, you have a section for theatrical movie reviews, please have people use THOSE sections. I want to be able to go to a product on your website and actually read a review of the product, NOT the movie that was in theaters months ago. Everyone knows a review of the theatrical release is NOT a review of the final DVD product as things change--i.e. features are added, scenes may or may not be added or trimmed, technical changes for high-end electronics, etc.What's next? Am I going to go to the video game review of Transformers: The Movie and read the theatrical review or if I go to the movie soundtrack section, am I going to see the theatrical review. Reviews have certain places on here so people can review everything they want. All I am asking is to keep the reviews in the categories they belong. Thanks."
5,dvd,love the dvd great to watch it with my grandson and on a cold night with popcorn great movie need to watch again
2,Not as great as people say...,"Honestly, all I enjoyed from this movie was the gorgeous computer effects with the Transformers....but otherwise, it has a pretty lame plot. I thought I would possibly enjoy the humor in the film, but I felt like the director was forcing too much sexual jokes into the film (which I found to be more annoying than funny). Cheesy romance and drama. The relationship between Sam and Mikaela is nothing you haven't already seen in a low budget Disney movie. The movie itself was way too drawn out. I pretty much didn't care by the time the final battle came. I was a Transformer fan myself when I was a kid, but man, this movie just killed it."
3,Great movie! Mediocre transfer....,"Enough has been said about the movie. Michael Bay did way better than anyone ever thought could have been done with the Transformers toys. I enjoyed the movie enough to purchase the Blu-Ray after I'd already had the DVD. While the Blu-Ray is better than the DVD, my feeling is that for a movie that was so heavy on digital effects, I would have expected a much better transfer, a sharper and crisper picture on those amazing action sequences. I was a bit disappointed."
3,Special Features Anyone??,"Yea, the movie is good, but if you like to get your moneys worth on DVDs like I do, this is not one of them. There are NO special features in this DVD. I should of bought it on Blu-ray."
3,A Michael Bay film that actually works....,"Michael Bay has an amazing penchant for goofy, over-blown pyrotechnic militaristic spectacles. His first outing, Independence Day, was a god awful mess. So badly written plotted and xenophobic/jingoistic that it led to quite a few internet lists of ""what I learned from independence day.""The sad fact of the matter is Michael Bay has all the sensibilities and moral depth of a 13 year old comic book junkie. Its said though that true art is accomplished when an artist meets the limitations of the medium and uses them to their best advantage. I just finally saw the Transformers movie and it is a perfect 13 year old fantasy. Michael Bay met and used his own limitations in this film and, wonders of wonders, it works.This is not a deep movie. In fact its a goofy, over-blown pyrotechnic militaristic spectacle. But its exactly what every kid imagined while playing with his Transformers and watching it unfold on screen is surprisingly fun, even for an adult."
3,Quick Review,Transformers has outstanding special effects with a below average screenplay. It is a typical Hollywood big budget/little brain movie.
4,Transformers [HD DVD],Great over all extras & unlockables. The movie is the perfect summer block buster. Just leave your leave your your expectations of the perfect movie behind.
4,"Good, but could have been great","I would have loved to see this film in the directorial hands of Steven Spielberg or James Cameron, but Michael Bay didn't screw everything up this time. The CGI, as mentioned in every review you read, is flat out amazing. There was also a lot more humor than I expected, and most of it worked. Shia LaBeouf is turning into a fine young actor, though his performance in Disturbia is fleshed out much more. Megan Fox is a babe, pure and simple. Her performance was okay, but her looks alone should get her far in hollywood. There were a few horrible lines and the military guys weren't very believable at all, but other than that I had a blast.The theater I was in busted out in applause at least five times during the movie, so that tells you how most people felt about the film.3.5 out of 5 stars"
2,A Bay Mass Market Trash Movie,"Yes, this is a typical Michael Bay Film. Like The island, it has no script. It has a lot of explosions, fake CG robots, sexy women who can not act, and wooden acting by the men. The human characters act even more like robots then the Transformers do.There is no one and nothing to like about this movie, and I'm sure the geeks will like the video game more."
2,Transformers DVD,"Although the delivery of this product was very quick, the DVD skips greatly. The skips work themselves out, but as a mother of a three year old who insists on watching the movie at bedtime, it is very annoying to watch the movie on constant pause."
5,Best movie of the summer,"Even though the summer isn't over, NOTHING can top this movie. I grew up in the 80's watching the cartoon, still have the old school transformers at my mom's place. I loved that they dug up the original voice for Optimus Prime and Megatron. A shame they couldn't use the original voice of Megatron, but they did find a good replacement. The cgi used for the robots was amazing and didn't look as fake and ridiculous as some other movies have. Between Optimus Prime and Ironhide, I was laughing my butt off and some of their one-liners. Sweet cars, awesome cgi, great comedy, original voice casting, what more can you ask for? I may yet see this a second or third time before it leaves the theaters."
5,One of the best movies ever!,This movie is great! The special effects are wonderful and the plot is great. And upgrading bumblebee to a camaro is a good change. I was a faithful cartoon watcher and this movie is absolutely wonderful!
5,Awesome Movie! Reminiscent of Indepence Day,"Overall I liked the movie, the special effects were mind blowing.The stars were good looking, Megan and the other blonde were too good.As a kid of the 80s, I think they did a real good job on Transformers.However, this movie is eerily similar to Independence Day.The scary bio-suite scene in ID4 vs the Tail scene in TF. both make u jump in your seat.Will Smith (soldier) lost in the desert in ID4 vs Army men lost in the desert in TF.Vivica A Fox drivin a big truck to help out in ID4 vs Megan Fox drivin a big tow truck to help out in TF.Sending a virus to the mothership in ID4 vs Virus sent to Defense computers in TF.Classififed secret project on UFO/Aliens in Area 51 in ID4 vs Classified secret project on Cube/Alien Bot in Sector 7 in TF.The list goes on and on! But still Transformers is done well and is like an updated version."
4,Nonstop action from the word GO,"OMG! Nonstop action from the word go. I've been a Transformers fan for more than two decades and one of my most recent coupes is finding a rare video copy of the original movie released in 1986. It doesn't hold a candle to the new release. I went to see it with my two teenaged daughters and all of us sat there big eyed and spellbound for the entire movie. Frankly, I never knew my kids could sit still that long. In my wildest dreams I never thought I would hear Optimus Prime say, ""My bad!"" LOL It was definitetly worth the price of the ticket and I know it will definitely be worth the Jackson to get it on DVD."
3,Not all I expected,"As a child I grew up watching Transformers and I loved it. This movie, although very close to the original series is missing a key element: the sound transformers made everytime they turn into anything... you only hear it for about 5 minutes in total for the whole movie... other than that the movie is more than ok and the girl is really hot so it get compensated jajaja. Enjoy!"
5,FANTASTIC Movie,"This movie was simply close to perfect, the storyline, and characters were very well created, and they all have played a significant role in the movie. THIS IS NOT THE 80'S CARTOON, SO DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BE AN EXACT REPLICA FOR IT.now there are alot of bashers, who dont know a shred about transformers, and will bash it juss to show how ignorant they are i say watch it for yourself and then make your OWN judgement about itif you get confused with anything about it, u could read about it on wikipedia, for the reasons why Bay and his team did what they did about the movie, and if you want more backstory to it, read the prequel comicbook, or the prequel dvd"
4,I CRIED!!,"Im embarrassed to say my eyes actually watered up when Optimus Prime and the other transformers were introduced. Yes I'm a grown man... I think. Anyway, seeing your favorite childhood cartoon heros come to life is something many transformer fans dreamed about as snot nosed kids.I was ready to write this off as another bad melodramatic Micheal Bay movie. But after an hour into it I realized this is exactly what a live action movie of the cartoon series would look like! I mean, how serious can you make a movie about robots that come to earth and transform into cars?? Everything is hammed up and over the top. (some painfully cheezy moment here). But in the grand sceme of things it all comes togehter and makes sense. If you were a fan of the cartoon then you must see it. This will probably be my first HD DVD purchase for my shiney new HDTV."
1,Just awful,"The script, casting, and acting is insultingly bad. Towards the end, I almost felt uncomfortable due to the awkward, childish dialogue mixed in with the repetitive drawn out fight sequences.And another thing: Why do directors keep putting Shia LaBeouf in their movies? Is he really the new generation's action hero? What a total spaz! I just slapped my forehead when I first learned that he was going to be in the most recent Indiana Jones."
2,"Good special FX, BAAD Acting","I was so hyped to see this movie after all the build up to Summer, man what a letdown. My fears that Michael Bay would ruin this movie were completely realized. The first HOUR is nothing but the kid screwing around with his car, add to that lame jokes, slapstick humor, too much emo teen angst, and the worst performance from John Turturro I've ever seen. Not too mention they only gave Starscream one line in the ENTIRE film. I seriuosly hope Bay keeps his threat not to direct the sequel, Steven Spielberg could have done such a better job himself. Rent it, trust me you don't want to waste the money.Edit: I've had over a year to let this film sink in, and my opinion of it has improved. I've noticed a lot of Bay films are like that, cheesy and cliche at first, then they become comforting to watch over time. I still want to see way more robot acting in the sequel, but without the need to set up a second movie, hopefully the action will kick off right from the start."
1,"Woo-Hoo, a toy movie with a potty mouth!!!","Amazed at how little I want to ever see this movie again, let alone own it. Three months have gone by and all I can still remember is the cringing embarrassment at watching this dull, low life-inspired film with my young daughter.Look honey, there's a flabby old actor's butt in a thong! Ooh, over there are racist stereotypes that turn into compact cars! What a rush...And to think they're going to make a third one. what's next, a pimp daddy robot with his AutoHo's?"
1,It's a 2.5 hour GM commercial!,"So let me get this straight... i just spent two and a half hour watching a GM commercial with mediocre actors, unrealistic 'transformations' of robots (although the digital effects are superb but once you've seen the first one it gets old).... and I had to pay for this.The acting was horrible -- the cars not much to look at and the robots all look the same to me. The story predictable. Again, this was about the first few robot transformation... don't waste your time/money on this!"
1,Uh...,"Transformers is a movie in the same way that my house is a movie. Which is to say, not.My house doesn't have a plot. Neither does Transformers. My house doesn't have characters. Neither does Transformers.Bottom line: Transformers is more like a house, or a dog, or anything else you can think of than a movie."
5,Transformers DVD,"The Movie was great.I loved watching it with my family.Being a fan growing up, I was able to share the experience with my son."
5,Transformers Movie,"Great movie. I would not recommended it for children under the age of 10. Has lots of violence. Other than that, way cool believable special effects. Good choice for actors playing key characters."
5,Escelente Bonus,"Me parecio excelente el bonus que trae este especial, el hecho de que venga subtitulado, me parecio un buen gesto de los productores.un 100 para este DVD de la pelicula."
2,Sci- FI not for me!,"I thought the movie was really cool how they were able to create the transformers but I am not in to the sci fi part of it!! The story was good, some laughs but if you are not into the sci fi part of it I wouldn't recommend it."
4,content,"no complaints. they got it to me punctually. and the 8-year old boy inside of me (that lived on transformers and GI Joe - the latter of which is going to be totally lame, btw) was not disappointed. yes, it's not a masterpiece, but given that the original was a damn toy commercial (which I LOVED) i think that they did a darn good job. just b/c the original audience has grown snobby and old does not mean the movie should outgrow its roots."
5,Best Movie of ALL F***IN Time,This movie will blow u away with its epic action sences and amazing story telling. From start 2 finish u won't be able 2 look away it will RAZZEL and DAZZEL u like no other movie before. Mighty BIG thumbs up 2 u Mr.Bay u R a gift from Cybertron looking forward 2 the upcoming sequels.ps. whens is bad boyz 3 coming.....
1,DVD won't play on anything!!!,"I got this item for my husband's christmas present. It say's it is an HD DVD and not blu-ray so I didn't think we would have a problem watching it in our Xbox. It wouldn't play in our Xbox so we tried it on the computer and it wouldn't play. Tried it in a regular DVD player and it wouldn't play either. We have tried it in other DVD players, newer models, and it won't play in those either. We even let some friends try it in their blu-ray player to see if it would play in there and nope it wouldn't play. Don't buy this item get a regular DVD or Blu-ray disc. I feel terrible that I got this for him and he can't even watch it."
3,"Great Movie, but not Blu-Ray Quality","I like this movie, but in comparison to other Blu-Ray movies, the quality is not that good. I found many scenes in the movie that were very grainy and seemed even less than DVD quality much less Blu-Ray quality. I played the movie on a Sony BDP-S350 and a good HDTV. My comparison was to my other Blu-Ray movies like Planet Earth (one of the best ever high def productions)."
2,"Good god... have I lost my mind.. or maybe I have graduated to the ""other"" generation!!","All right! I understand that Transformers have been around forever and every kid had them. My kids did. They loved Transformers too! But market placement does not a good movie make!! The plot was weaker than 2% milk and the character development coulda been a Slurpee (translation: it SUCKED!!) There was plenty of action, but nothing to tie it all together and make us care.My adolescent daughter summed up the main character's existence as a constant attempt to get lucky with the cute mechanic chick who apparently had no reason to be there at all! Why couldn't they have developed the character of the hyper-cool cyberchick who figured out the transformers were there in the first place... now THAT woulda been a more entertaining movie!!It hurts to see that such an average film got so many to rave about it. I guess the marketing should get 5 stars!!!I'd take Iron Giant any day over this claptrap :)All the best,Jay"
2,"Big, dumb and ultimately boring film","""Transformers"" is another entry in the Michael Bay ""Big, Dumb"" movie canon. It starts off OK with some good action and quirky humour but all the fun soon drains away amid confusing and repetitive fights scenes, dopey attempts to make the Autobots seem like regular guys, awkward attempts at romance, and a totally predictable 3rd act. But probably the biggest flaw the film has is that the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons is fundamentally uninteresting. ""Transformers"" has all that money can buy but no heart - and gives us no reason why we should care about these characters be they human or robot. A case study in the premise that ""special effects do not a film make""."
2,"Gutter humor. OK, but not for young children","I'd really hesitate allowing young children to watch this one. I don't know what is wrong with the folks' heads who made it, but the humor is grossly inappropriate for children--real gutter talk. Aside from a couple scenes like this, it wouldn't be too bad for children. Watch it first before you decide to allow your kids to view it."
2,"Great special effects, but lame show.","The visuals in the movie are awesome! The movie looks great on Blu-Ray. The character development was horrible. The plot was weak, and I was hopping for something more. Would recommend for the special effects but not for the story. Some parts are spectacular, like the intro at the Soccent Qatar airforce base, but as a whole the show does not deliver."
4,i was hoping that labeouf would be stepped on,"i grew up waiting for this movie. i loved everything about it but the decision to have shia labeouf be the main character. something about him just drives me insane. i do not care if 500 or so people gave this movie 5 stars, everyone has a actor or actress that they can not stand to watch. alien race of evil shape changing robots bent on ruling earth is a lot more believable than this bozo making out with megan fox. my issues aside you can not go wrong with this movie, crazy action, cool cgi its just a good movie with a weak lead actor"
4,Enjoyed the BD-Live a lot,The family enjoyed the BD-Live aspect of this Blu-ray movie. The movie is always fun to watch.
4,"Had a couple problems, but otherwise pretty good","After hearing that this was a Michael Bay movie, I went in with pretty low expectations, so it wasn't hard to exceed them. This movie did more than that. It was definately a adrenaline pumping joy ride, and I had a lot of fun watching it. My only concerns were A.)I don't really care for the shaky camera thing that some directors are trying to do. In a movie that was so laden with special effects, I thought it was out of place, and B.)and I'm not complaining, but Megan Fox is clearly not in high school. I'm not complaining, but come on... Other than that, I really enjoyed this movie."
4,More like 3.5 stars really.,"This is not an art film. This film has nothing deep to say about the human condition. This film IS fun.An entertaining new entry in the Transformers multiverse, this film manages to be pretty decent while being vastly different from all before it.The Good: Frenetic robot fights, a pre-ego Megan Fox, an excellent opening sequence, a decent introduction to the concept of the franchiseThe Bad: Some of the action is too shaky cam, the humans are focused on a bit too muchThe Ugly: Robots should not pee on people. Nuff SaidA decent action/scifi film with a few flaws. Not to be taken in while in an artsy kind of mood."
2,Garbage.,"Wow. What a rotten movie... From beginning to end, it's one movie cliche after another, and one ridiculous line after another. Granted, it looks great, but that's all it has going for it, and apparently, that's all it takes these days, based on the reviews here on Amazon.It's a one-star movie, with an extra star for the visuals."
3,Great movie.....HD isnt all that impressive,"I bought this on HD DVD thinking this movie would be mind blowing and it falls short. The movie itself is great, i really enjoyed it.....sadly the HD version takes away from the film. There are certain shots in the film where the HD seperates the robots from the background and you can cearly see that they are CGI. Maybe its just my eyes, but i can easily see it and it bothered me all through out the movie.Overall, the film rocks. I would just buy it on reg DVD since the HD causes things to stick out so much more......"
4,"Great action, goofy sub-plot",I think this is a good movie with great action scenes. I grew up with the toys and couldn't wait to this movie. The only issue I had was the weird attraction between one robot and the main human character. I especially liked the suped-up Camero and Mustang (nothing hotter than a B/W sportscar).
4,Great Movie,Great kids movie. I really enjoyed it; hubby thinks there's too many prolonged action sequences but come on it's an action flick geared towards kids. Too bad the makers of this movie are not thinking of making a sequal or that they didn't release it in Blu-ray since I own a PS3. I'm sure they lost some $$$ from that decision.
4,the dvd with specil features,"this movie is awesome with the fact that it has specil features of 'how did they do that?"" it is awesome"
3,Explosive.,It was nice to be entertained for a couple of hours. If you like seeing a beloved 80s cartoon come to life then this is for you.
1,EVERYTHING past the CGI is lame!!,"All I heard was how good this movie is and so...I bought it and....well, it isn't..."
3,Incorrectly advertised on Amazon,I loath wide screen movies so I purchased this one and paid much more than I could have purchased it for locally because Amazon claimed this movie was full screen. IT IS NOT!! It is widescreen! The movie was good but I was terribly disappointed with the widescreen.
1,Definitely not what it could or should have been,"I went to see this hoping to see a good popcorn action movie and was sorely disappointed with the results. If you're under the age of 17, this movie might be great for you, but for grownups, the humor is juvenile (not Family Guy juvenile, Ed Edd and Eddy juvenile), the romantic subplot is dull, Shia LeBouef comes across as a creepily horny teenager, the movie doesn't feature much in the way of action until the last 20 minutes, and said action is shot in a shaky camera style that makes it hard to keep an eye on what's going on."
1,Absolutely unredeemable garbage.,"Horribly bad doesn't go far enough. It is difficult to imagine how big the paychecks were to get actors like Shia LeBeouf and Jon Voight to participate in this ignorant mess. Add to that a streak of idiotic, and likely inadvertent, racism that paints virtually every black character as emotionally unhinged, vulgar, or both. There are all kinds of laughs here, but mainly of the cringing, unintentional variety. I'm tempted to say that it might appeal to 5 year old boys, but why expose them to this kind of cinematic excrement?"
1,Stick with the cartoon. There's more depth.,"Wow...the cartoon casted Orson Welles, Robert Stack and Leonard Nemoy. The new movie had a bunch of losers. You be the judge."
1,I'd give it 0 stars if i could.,"having wasted close to 3 hours of my 29th birthday on this movie, i walk away feeling as if my every child hood fantasy has been raped ... god damn you Michel Bay, god damn you Stephen Spielberg."
5,"Awsome movie, Ignore anything below 4 stars",Time and time agian the fan boys troll giving a movie a rating it dosent desirve. Go use your playstation 3 for that is was made for .... games.... oh wait there isnt a single game worth buying a ps3 for so you have to watch blu rays and then cry when one of the best movies ever made isnt relased for your blu gay system. Mabe you should reconsider being a sony loyalist because they dont care about the average consumer hence the format war they brought upon us.By the way the movie is awsome.
2,Good lite entertainment.,"Great action and painstaking attention to detail. However, (SPOILER) there is a scene where Agent Simmons- an inept, pushy, mean and stupid man - is forced to remove his clothes. Of course he is wearing commical boxer shorts; but is also wearing a bright chrome Cross around his neck. This is just another example of Hollywood going out of their way to impune and belittle Christianity."
4,Four stars only because...,Four stars only because the edition with a transforming DVD case is the one that should get 5 stars.
5,More than meets the eye,"I loved the Transformers cartoon series growing up, and this movie brought my childhood back to life. Amazing effects, especially on Blu-ray!"
5,pretty good deal for the price,The disc arrived quickly and in pretty good shape for the price. Thank You !
5,Best movie of the summer,"Transformers was easily the best movie of the summer. I am not a huge Transformers fan, and I would have waited until it came out on dvd, but my husband insisted we had to go see it. Boy am I glad we did! It was so action packed and entertaining. I would recommend this movie to anyone, I loved it. Now we own it on HD dvd!"
2,Sub-par,Too long for no reason. Slow moving plot. Previews showed all the good parts. No character development - what were their names even? A movie that all it has going for it is the computer animation - which does not carry a movie like this.
1,Not sure why so many people like this movie.,"I love movies based on cartoons and action figures just as much as anyone. IF they are done right. This movie is crap. Well, maybe that's a bit harsh. There were some cool special effects and action scenes. But overall, the acting, scriptwriting, dialogue, plot lines, just ruin it. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at something a character said. Plain and simple, this movie is stupid. I heard so many good things about it that I was shocked at just how dumb the dialogue was. It was hard to get past. And there are way too many unnecessary scenes, making this movie over 2 hours long. An hour and a half would have done the trick. For nostalgia's sake it's worth a watch. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
2,It's alright I guess...,"Alot of people that saw this movie around the same time that I did, of course asked me how I felt about it. My opinion that I gave them and I still hold was a three. We debated and debated and then came the question, ""Why you giving it a three and not a five?"" My reponse was and I'm gonna try to say this without crapping on anyones parade who has'ne seen it yet, it was done kind of sloppy. I understand that it isn't easy putting building size bots to move like something a billion times better that those funny a55 things in power rangers, but don't bombard me with 10 different scenes and try to confuse the hect out of my perception. It's really hard to focus watching this movie man. Well, I think I said enough...this by no means to me is a five or anything above!"
2,Didn't realize the language would be so adult,"Even though I knew it was rated PG13, I thought it was probably because of action violence. I was wrong."
3,my mistake,I didn't see that it was in HD format and am unable to view it. Order was shipped quickly and Discs are in good shape. They did their job well.
3,Meh,Not a bad flick. Would be absolutely god awful if Shia wasn't in it. He truly carries this one. The acting otherwise is sub par to say the least. Megan Fox is so gorgeous...but she can't act even a little. Jon Voigt is hilariously bad in this one. It is hard to believe he is the same person who was in Midnight Cowboy. I could go on all day...but ultimately it was interesting enough for a Michael Bay crap fest. If you love action with mediocre acting and plot this is the flick for you.
3,Remake of a classic?,"I lived through transformer ""action figures""... theydid a animation series and movie on this in the '80's with famous voices.The special effects aren't that special or believable.This movie is the second movie starring Shia Labeouf that I've reviewdand I think Megan Fox was a bigger attraction.Shape shifting robots is a pretty far out ideaeven now. It is all actionwith very little acting or dialog: the plotis Roswell, Area 51 and The Thing meets the Invaders from Outer Space:pure B movie."
5,Great quality blu-ray,One of the best picture quality blu-rays available. Perfect to be used as a demo for HDTVs.
3,Corny but real good,"A great kid's movie made for adults. Michael Bay's bigger than life version of the cartoon. A big-budget, effects heavy version with tons of action and a decent plot. Megan Fox keeps every guy pinned to his seat. She's that good an actress. I never actually heard her speak, but she definitely stole the show IMO. Shia as a lead plays the perfect awkward/funny teen."
1,transformers suck,"this had to be one of the worse movies i have ever watched! bad acting, stupid story, no continuity in the story line and gratuitous action and violence. this director should be horse wipped. he take a look a look at the Spiderman trilogy and learn how to make an action movie with an interesting story and superb acting.PO"
1,Another Junk toy for the Closet,"Amazing what parent have to sit through so jr can be amused, not to mention the toy store trash for Xmas..."
1,One Line Review,"If you wanted to keep the giant evil robot frozen for the last 75 years, spraying it with freezy stuff in an open warehouse was probably not the most efficient way to do it. Just a thought."
5,TRANSFORMERS is AWESOME!!!,"This is an awesome action-robot film based on some action figures! I watched this movie some time last year, then three months ago, back when I was a senior in high school, our English teacher let us watch this, and I'm glad she did because I forgot how cool it was! Sam Witwicky buys a car that happens to be an Autobot named Bumblebee. Sam is introduced to other Autobots, named Optimus Prime, Jazz, and others. (Our dog's name is Jazz!) The Autobots have to save the world and stop the evil Decepticons, and their leader, Megatron. There is a lot of action, gun-play, and robots fighting, if you love that, and a little comedy, you'll love TRANSFORMERS!!!"
3,Transformers...,Not a fan of the original kid cartoon so am only going by this movie. It is an okay movie but filled with the typical crud from hollywood that they spread to our youth as standard! The action is fine and exciting. The good guys are endearing and the film makes you root for them so what else is needed? I don't really recommend this movie for the whole family.
2,"Liked the movie, HATE the DVD","All my other SD DVDs look great upsampled to 1080i. This one doesn't. It is just too dark and the colors are frequently very wrong. I saw the movie twice in the theater and it looked great. I only wish I had rented the DVD before buying. Could this be a deliberate push for consumers to move to HD media, or could they really be this incompetent? Who the hell wants to adjust their TV to watch a movie and adjust it back when they're done?! Grrr..."
2,I was expecting more than meets the eye on this dvd,"The film is really cool and I love it, unfortunately the second disc is veeery disappointing. I thought That it will has lots of documentaries about concept design and special effects, but is mostly about talking with Michael Bay and militar people bla .. bla bla...There is a short part dedicated to show some concept illustrations for some scenes but it's very short.Star wars Episode 2 or 3, and the Lord of the rings trilogy (extended edition) have really nice documentaries, lots of images, lots of sculptures, concept design, digital FX makings etc...I was disappointed with this ""special edition"""
4,Fun action film,"I grew up watching the old Transformers cartoons and playing with the Transformer toys so I was interested in seeing how they were going to do this live action film.I watched the DVD and I have to say that it was better than I expected. The special effects of course were brilliant and the plotline even made sense. The acting is also pretty good.Other than the film, there isn't much on the DVD itself, atleast not in the standard version."
4,Good quality at a good price,"The movies is amazing, it took a little time and the case looks like is a limited edition, even though it doesn't have any features, it's just the movie."
4,Classic soon as it was released,They did an amazing job of bring the cartoon to a real movie. Thank you hollywood.
2,transformers,"i don't really like this movie,though my kids love it...i'm older,so i've seen movie-after-movie-after-movie that has this nerd-becomes-hero-and-gets-girl-in-the-end scenario...special effects are ok,but they go too fast...you can't really appreciate the car-to-robot change sequence...the story is weak and filled with time-consuming routines('don't step on my mom's flowers').how long does the hero run in the closing minutes,and how many city blocks (both up and down stairwells)does this guy run and they JUST-CAN'T-CATCH-HIM?i don't need this..."
2,Transformers is strictly for young teens,"Watched with 11 year old son. He loved and I hated it. Dialog borders on brain dead with plot that makes no sense. You just wade through mindless drivel waiting for action that is mediocre. Optimus prime has a sword that he doesn't use on Megatron? If you are a boy between the ages of 11 and 15, this movie was made for you. All others should beware wasting 2 hours of your life."
4,Recommended by a friend,"A friend is destined to become the leader of an organization of which I am a member. He contends that we need to become Transformers, i.e., we are Positrons and we need to eliminate the Negatrons. He goes on and on about Optimus Prime, etc. I wanted to learn more about the folklore, so I ordered the movie. Later I found out that I should have ordered the cartoon."
3,GREAT FX BUT ......OVERLY LONG FOR THE MATERIAL!,"By the time Transformers were popular in the 80's I was too busy with girls, music and partying to even notice them. Maybe that is why I don't go ape for these ""toys"" turned mechanical movie stars. I was excited to see the movie because well.......it looked cool, plain and simply! I thought the special effects were incredible and the story was fast paced with some much needed humor thrown in. The biggest problem with this film is that it is way too long and I found myself looking at my watch a few times. It just didn't need to be this long and with a trim here and there you would have an excellent popcorn movie. I watched it twice and fell asleep both times and this is in my home theater with insane subwoofer and speakers! 3 stars is generous believe me! The DVD transfer on the 2 disc set is excellent and there are some interesting extras."
4,Oh! Yes! Excellent Movie,"Best movie this summer... Watched the Transformers as a kid... so ...dragged a reluctant hubby to the movie. He came out smiling, laughing, and then spent an hour going through the one-liners. Thank you for this very entertaining movie!"
1,DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM HERE,"So this seller has been the worst that I have ever encountered. First they sent the wrong movie, then they didn't return my email when I asked about the extra postage and if they would cover it. So they wanted ME to pay for THEIR mistake. I bought it online because I was expecting a better buy but in the end, incuding the shipping I was better off buying it at Wal-Mart. This seller had no interest in fixing the problem and only answered me when it was convineint for the seller. Buy at own risk. Oh and I decided it was cheaper to just keep the wrong movie than it was to send it back, so I'm stuck with a movie I didn't intend on buying because I just didn't want to work with this person anymore. Do not buy here!!! No joke!"
2,Not what I thought it would be,"Most people thought this movie would fail at the box office, and it didn't.It prove to be a huge blockbuster summer hit.I really like this movie. It is very entertaining and serves it purpose well. I mean, it is not the best movie ever made, but it is way better than Spider-Man 3 and Pirates, that's for sure.Now the DVD is not what I was expecting.The above rating is for the DVD, and not fot the movie itself.I didn't buy it, but when I read its content I felt like something was missing. Other than the movie, it doesn't have interesting special features. I'll rather wait a few months or maybe a year 'till they release an extended ultimate director's cut super sized limited collector's edition that I'm sure will eventually surface.Like King Kong.Just wait and see."
1,This movie has no soul.,"As the title states, this movie has no soul or feeling. I am a fan of the original series and went out and bought the DVD without seeing it in the theaters. I went in it with no expectations and watched it with my wife (she wanted to watch it...I was happy watching Dexter Series 1 DVD). We both hated it. It was the worse movie we have seen this year. Dancing Robots (Jazz)...WTF, All Spark (just call it Energon Cube), Sam instead of Spike, stupid sex stuff, dog peeing on one of the autobots, stupid one-liners, and the computer animation. The list goes on...your life will be better if you do not see this film nor will you waste 2 hours of your life."
2,Human Robots!,"When I see a movie with no inclination to view it again that's a movie that did not do it's job. The reason for the two stars goes to the robotics, these metal giants looked good and the transformations were cool. The movie overall was ridiculous. Imagine, you are told that certain things need to get done otherwise the planet you know as earth will be destroyed, coupled with mind bogling harvoc going on all around, you are worried about your mother's rose garden. Pathetically unrealistic! The Transformers looked and acted more real than the humans. Maybe this is what Stephen tried to convey, that humans are becoming robots in their day to day activities. Still a good movie to see with your children, their little eyes will pop to see these giant brightly painted machines."
4,"GOOD MOVIE, GREAT HD!",Overall a good movie in my opinion! the HD version is excellent with a stunning picture and great audio! A must have for fans of HD
4,Transformers,good action movie as what i been waiting for 27 years since childhood.A cartoon turnout to be realife robot.3 times i've watched over since it shown in cinema.Great ideas n special effects in making.4 thumbs up to Michael bay.
4,Surprisingly fun,"I expected this to suck and be completely a 'guy film'. Now, normally, I can watch guy flicks just fine but I just thought this would be utterly cheesy and boyish. I was pleasantly surprised. It was a tad overlong but the action completely made up for it. The effects were amazing, the acting was pretty good and the plot was easy to follow. I will definetely be picking this up on DVD."
1,This is web based,"This DVD is web-enabled, meaning you have to hook up your HDDVD player to the web in order to download content. I'm sure my Toshiba player is compatible, but I don't have a DSL line anywhere near my home theater unit. Unless you are willing and able to logon to the web with your HDDVD player, I'd pass on this movie. It should come with a warning to alert the buyer of the need to logon. All I get is an error message indicating that the DVD is web enabled and will not load."
1,Shipped wrong Version,I wanted blueray and got reg dvd. Returned product but as of yet have not received a refund from you.
1,Transformers it is not.,"The special effects are good, but it is still a bad movie. This is just another end of the world movie. The only different thing, is it has some goofy good robots. The comedy in it falls flat. The story has holes in it. The police car robot disappears. Most of the human characters are not needed in the movie. Every character in the movie is dull, and has not been fleshed out. If you like pointless action movies, then see this movie. Otherwise don't waste your time."
2,Cheaper than a vacuum cleaner...,"but it sure sucks...If you want a pretty in-depth critique f the movie I would suggest The Movie Preview Critic's running commentary (full disclosure: I am in now way linked with TMPC).The Plot: full of holesThe Characters: poorly developedThe Jokes: mostly juvenile and lameThe Effects: mostly good in themselves, but so many of the 'wow' scenes were screwed upThe Dialog: cringe-worthyThis movie wasn't going to be as good as Shawshank Redemption, but it could have been as good as The Matrix. Instead it got closer to Matrix 2 and Matrix 3. There is no excuse for ""Transformers"" (or, as I will refer to it from now on ""Plan 10 From Outer Space"")"
2,Get the Single Disc edition!!!,"I'm a big TF fan and this movie looks and sounds superb on dvd but spend your money on the single disc edition. The extra's you are getting here are just not worth your money. If you are intersted in all the human characters and the military involvment the special features will be right up you alley but if you want to know about the TFs, their history and how they got onto the big screen aswell, you will find no indepth material here. I suggest getting the single disc version for now and wait for the inevitable MEGA-Edition later on down the track."
3,CGI'd,"Had you never in your life seen a movie with Computer Generated Imagery, like Transformers, you would likely be astounded at the visuals in this movie. As it is, if you get the feeling you've seen it all before, it's because you have. Although the FX are top notch, there's no doubting the feeling that your're watching CGI generated effects. Bummer, but probably no different than others with CGI. The movie itself is pretty entertaining, but like any Michael Bay movies, the thing goes by at an exasperating clip...I remember a movie reviewer once describing another Michael Bay movie, Armaggedon, as like sitting thru a two hour movie trailer! This is no different, the camera rarely stays still longer than 3 seconds or so, and neither does scene to scene...I literally stopped caring about the movie, and just was ready for the thing to be over with..but if your an adrenalin junky, this is right up your alley."
3,transformers a rip off on hddvd,having perchased transformers on standard dvd then perchased it on hddvd playing it on my toshiba HD-E1 uk player to compare it with the standard dvd playing on my ps3 both through my onkyo amp with 1080p output the picture on the hddvd picture is only very slightly better ie:sharper than the standard print on dvd so how can people keep saying that hddvd and blu-ray are the same picture.i have tomb raider 2 cradle of life from germany on blu-ray and the quality of the picture makes the standard dvdlook average having over 150 blu-rays and only 12 hddvds i will not be buying any more
5,Pleasantly Surprised...and Amazed,"I bought Transformers to see what my HD DVD player was capable of--and I was not disappointed. However, I was surprised to find that the movie as a whole was thoroughly enjoyable.I collected Transformers as a child, and the movie helped me to recapture some of the joy I experienced playing with those toys in my youth. Although not quite true to the original story, I absolutely loved it. Good story, funny, and featuring AMAZING special effects, Transformers is now my favorite HD DVD. Buy it. You'll be glad you did."
4,Good Movie,"I had never watched Transformers cartoons as a kid so I was a little clueless coming into this movie but it was really good. Good acting, pretty funny."
5,great movie,Great movie and great to watch in surround sound lots of action. recieved product in perfect shape and time.
5,"TRANSFORMERS, the movie itself, is AWESOME!","Like several other people mentioned, this is not a place to knock on AMAZON or discuss your technical troubles...As for the movie itself. This is one of my favorites in a long time. (I'm a 28-yr-old male, married w/ one child.) The movie just left me with my jaw wide open for several minutes at a time. I cannot, however, deny that it indeed had a bit of a nostalgia factor. I LOVED, no, ADORED the Transformers as a child and, despite a couple unnoticeable inaccuracies, it kept the personalities accurate and took me back to a time where only good vs. evil mattered. As a bonus there were SEVERAL if not MANY hilarious moments in the movie. It was SURPRISINGLY funny. =)A VERY enjoyable movie-watching experience!"
2,"F/X are great, story stinks","The F/X in this movie are outstanding and the action sequences in the desert are fun to wtach, but typical of a Michael Bay film, the whole movie falls apart around the 1/2 way point when the story turn from simple but fun to dumb and boring.What a waste of a visual appealing movie.On a plus side, the DVD quality is excellent."
4,"A little bit of cheese, alot of action, not a ""kid"" movie","Although this movie has a bit of akward teenage cheesiness, it make up for it in amazing action scenes! Not much of a ""family"" movie from the aspect that I feel they put a little too much empasis on Megan Fox being a ""sex symbol"" throughout the movie; it's definately not a disney movie for the kids to see. I personally loved this movie and plan on owning it!"
4,Transformers ROCKS!,"Can you believe a 40-ish mother of teenagers really enjoyed such a movie? Took me back to my early years of babysitting and playing with the small, impossible to master (unless you were a boy age 2 and above), plastic toys.This movie has a great story line, does a good job of keeping in line with the origial cartoon, while taking on a personality of it's own. Lot's of action, comedy and adventure! I LOVE when they use well known American icon's, such as the Hoover Dam, and explain it was always a cover-up for something we American's couldn't possibly fathom!We enjoyed the movie extra's about the cast and seeing the level of detail that they put into the special effects in the movie. No surprise to anyone who has actaully watched the movie!My only dissappointment was the fact that there weren't any deleted scenes or bloopers included. Doesn't Blu-Ray have a TON of storage space? Why can't they continue to include fan favorites???"
4,not art but it's a good watch,"Why does everyone talk about this film like they were expecting Shakespeare with robots? It's an action summer flick that is about robots, explosions and a randomly tossed in hot chick that as far as I remember had nothing to do with the cartoon or the comics.Disc is great, no complaints even plays fine in my el cheapo blu-ray player which does not support firmware updates."
2,"Lightweight, prurient, thinly disguised commercial",The average 12 year old won't catch the obnoxious level of product placement in this frothy robot romp and will instead fixate on Ms. Fox's wares or the shiny hardware but as an adult I found it painful to sit through this rubbish and was offended that in such a tame context the writers found it necessary to include a very lewd reference. For $12.50 I also don't want a shameless plug for the latest lineup from tottering General Motors. All noise and flashing lights and ultimately the celluloid equivalent of a Twinkie.The only nice thing I have to say is that the computer generated images were very very good.
2,Too long for a robot movie,"I thought this would keep my interest but I fell asleep after 30 minutes of this absurd movie. How about a CUBE FROM OUTER SPACE --- WOW! Anyway, I went back again and finally finished it. The robotic effects are amazing, the battle scenes are too long. The military is amazing, the dialogue is cute, all in all too long."
4,My son's favourite,I've been wanting to buy a blu-ray disc editon of this movie. I just didn't want the ordinary DVD because I'm a fan of high resolution videos. I was not disappointed by the PQ and the audio is quite nice as well. It may not be the best from the BD I own but this one is surely one on top.Buy this and I'm sure you will enjoy it.CheersArnold
5,Transformers,"If you like Ironman, and The Hulk with Edward Norton then you will like Transformers... It is a movie, the special effects are realand that is why I rnjoyed it..."
3,Transformers,Got it in the mail pretty fast. There was a little chip broken off from the case and had to clean the dvd to finish watching the movie. Overall good
5,Awesome,"I originally purchased an HDDVD Player solely because Transformers was only on HDDVD (still paying for that mistake). I didn't think it would be a big upgrade from HDDVD to BluRay for Transformers but it is. It is huge especially the urban sequences. Also, decepticon faces are very visible and you can make greater sense of who is fighting in the final confrontation. This is the BluRay you must have if you want to show someone why to get one or just to show off."
5,Great Movie Great Price,"I bought this on a black Friday special for $9.99. Watching it again in Blu-Ray was a real treat, especially for that cheap. I think is actually more clear on my TV than it was in the theater."
4,Exelent movie,"This was probably one of the best films of the summer, considering most others were just flops and poorly done. this one is an actual Gem, I'm a 17 year old who doesnt even like the serious of Transformers, but this movie caught my eye, partially because of Micheal Bay and SS. But yes, i will admit the movie is sometimes to much action happening too fast for someone to gather it all, but that would not be a problem with a smaller screen, not some movie theater sized screen. But anywho, the movie itself is well done, some stupid homour, but cool, almost believable storyline, great action, and of course, a love story thrown in to appeal to the ladies. I highly recomend this movie. Im not giving it a 5 because i rarely give fives for anything."
3,Transformers DVD,Got the DVD from Amazon and viewed the movie on my dvd blu Ray player which has HDMI connected to tv. Great movie to watch this dvd on wide screen tv. Good movie lots of action. They added a much needed Megan Fox in skimmpy outfits Helped the movie along. Also the action figures are sharp to what changing shapes ... 3 star rating.
1,Like a Chinese Bootleg,"Picture and sound quality is terrible compared to what I enjoyed in the theater. I'm now returning a second DVD. Not even worth watching unless all you have is a 2"" Ipod display.They need to recall all of these and re-master them to the original."
1,poor,This NOT a HD DVD movie....something to do with a computer....I will be asking for my money back...I was to believe it was a movie...wrong....
1,WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP,"This was one of those films that had me looking at everything in the cinema except the screen. When I saw the trailer I thought this film could be excellent. A good story, great action scenes (which Michael Bay is excellent at) and top notch movie effects. Yes, it had the visual effects and some brilliant action scenes. But very little else. What a disappointment. The whole parent interrogation scene and robots in the garden was utterly ridiculous. So bad I couldn't believe I was watching the same movie. And 3 hours long - there was at least 1 hour of TOTAL NONSENSE.Michael Bay you absolutely butchered it. This film is an insult to our intelligence. Please...please....do not purchase this DVD....you will be disappointed.And I hear Mr. Bay is already contracted for TRANSFORMERS 2 in 2009-2010! Looks like no end to the misery......"
1,UGH- HD!!,"Didn't realize that HD dvds DO NOT play in BluRay players!! This format doesn't even exist anymore- short lived format that only plays on HD specific players that do nothing but sit in the attic collecting dust, alongside old 8-tracks and cassettes!!DO NOT BUY HD DVDs unless you actually have an HD (not BLURAY) player- it WON'T WORK!!!...Lesson learned."
1,Blank DVD,"I loved this movie when I went to go see it in the theatre so I wanted to buy it on DVD. I tried to play it in my HD DVD player, my friends PS3 and it didnt work at all. I wasn't able to send it back because I was in IRAQ at the time but please be careful to make sure your DVDs work when they first arrive or you will be surprised like I was and can not return them."
2,good movie but came damaged,it is an excellent film but it came damaged. i recommend it seeing as it is a fantastic movie and it only costs 4$ but amazon is supposed to check and make sure that the product isn't damaged but clearly they didn't. bottom line is that it is a great movie but don't count on it getting there safely.
4,Great movie!,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. I was surprised to find that I loved the movie as well, so did my husband. The action scenes are great, the main character is wonderful and really brings the whole movie together. I will definitely be watching it again."
2,Entertaining but not my thing,This movie is action packed and entertaining. I must say though that I never saw the cartoon or followed it. I think it would be a good flick to take your teen kids and under too but I found it to be more of a kid movie. That is not bad it is not bad or an insult. It just wasn't for me.
1,Can you give negative stars?,"TransformersI was over at my stepson's for Thanksgiving and he put Transformers into the DVD player and was so excited about it being a great movie. At first I wasn't sure what to make of it. By the end of the movie I became convinced that the writers' strike must have been before the movie was made. This had to be one of the worse movies I have ever watched. I wouldn't have sat through the whole movie, but I wanted to be polite.Not recommended for anyone over twelve.Gunner 2007"
1,Very Sad,"I am sorry, i cant give you any command now, cause untill today i havent receive my order. According to DHL, my order still with our Malaysia Custom which cannot be release to me due to unforseen reason. I am very sad about this issue, I have been asked for help from DHL but they dont seen want to border me and told me this is out of thier scoop. If you can read my email here, I am pleased if you could give me an helping hand on this matters, please contact our local DHL rep. to get my stuff out as soon as possible. I am very very upsad untill I dont who to talk to."
1,DO NOT USE UNBOX!,"In response to the guy who said not to post technical complaints in the movie review section I say: show me where I can make my complaint with this garbage player as easily and as visibly as I can here.Normally I love Amazon. As a matter of fact, I did most of my Christmas shopping here. As an online store, they are tough to beat.This player, however has just taken the top spot on my ""worst video players ever"" list. It has frequently locked up my computer so badly that I couldn't even bring up the task manager to close the application.Even when I was able to view my movies it would take about 30 seconds for it to register that I wanted to pause playback.In short:Worst Media Player EVER!"
5,Transformers Movie a must see everyday,"I have had this movie for almost 1 month and not a week has passed and I have not watched it. Excellent movie, and I can't wait for part 2.Robots movements were spot, the CG is beyound this world for real."
4,The return to greatness,"What a fun watch. No, there is no storyline whatsoever, just action and more of it. Music does the actingjob and SFX fills in a lot of desired eyecandy. From the version in the 80s to this: the transformation continues. Thankfully the makers didn't retro it in any way: each generation of moviemaker should create their own version and they have succeeded immensely in my opinion."
3,"Good, but not Great","I bought/watched this because so many of my friends raved about it. Maybe you will to. I know that I resisted watching it in the theatres because, well, robots that turn into cars & stereos? Really?!? Then when so many friends said it was one of thier favorite movies of the summer I felt as if I missed out. Having watched it I admit it does have good special effects, but overall it really was not one of my personal favorites. I could have gotten away with renting it as I am not sure I will watch, and rewatch this one."
3,Better than I thought it would be ...,"I rented this movie because of a friend's recommendation. Although I guessed by the title how silly it is, the movie was better than I thought it would be. It was just mind numbing. They didn't even try to make the scientists sound plausible, they just strung phrases together like quantum mechanics and fourier transforms. However, the romance was good. The relationship between the man and his car or protector was interesting. Some of the sight gags were good. The acting was good. The actors took their parts seriously. The plot was silly, but it sort of worked because of the acting.In summary, if you don't mind having a few brain cells die during the watching of this film, there are far worse films out there. The movie does work sort of. If you are at the right age group, it probably works very well."
3,Does not lock onto a ratchet,"These tools are well made and the carrying case is top notch, my only knock on these is they don't have the ball recess that keeps them locked onto the end of a ratchet or extension. This could make the tool annoying or unusable depending on your application."
3,Just what I wanted.,Just what I expected for the price I paid.these work as advertised.Get them if you need them. No problems.
4,Decent quality,"I am very happy with the price and quality. As far as longevity, time will tell, but from experience, I feel these will last many years. They seem solidly built and worked well for my application."
4,decent quality,"These were bought strictly for if I ever have to change brake pads. All cars are different, some use regular metric bolts, but have seen a few with these inset hex bolts. Very hard late at night to find the right size, now I have them all. Probably very little use elsewhere around the house as these bolts are not very common."
2,Made in Taiwan,"The product description says MIT (Michigan Industrial Tool)I must do more research before I buy. product is made in Taiwan for Michigan Industrial tools. After twisting the first bit I tried, I tested it on a Rockwell tester at work. Product is hardened, testing at R/C 60+. Still skeptical and believing it was case hardened I machined the twisted bit in half, and retested. tested at R/C 60+. kudos to the bit. now the biggest disappointment the sockets do not lock. the sockets are missing the recess inside the square hole to allow for the locking ball. this was even a bigger disappointment,because I had purchased locking extensions on the same order. I would not buy again."
4,"Beautiful location, sweet story","This movie tells the bittersweet and sentimental story of the immigrant experience in Northern Minnesota in 1920 (the author of the short story from which it was adapted is from this area). It is a story of trials and tribulations, but never sinks into the ""poor me"" type of movie.The characters have many obstacles to overcome, but they carry on, solving one problem after another, not the least of which is a mail-order bride who arrives unable to communicate with anyone and who is shunned because she is German, not Norwegian, as was ordered.The scenery and cinematography are wonderful. The serenity of the area is perfectly conveyed. I will long remember loveliness of the waltz in the field."
5,A beautiful film!,"_Sweet Land_, the Spirit Award Winner from Minnesota director Ali Selim, is a gentle but gorgeous film, ""painterly"" in the words of several reviewers. I have screened the film for family, friends, graduate students, and undergraduates; every group of every age has enjoyed and appreciated the work."
5,About Time !!,"You know, it's about time that a theatrical romantic drama that is totally clean was released to the world. No slimy sex at all, just pure falling in love and the awesome feel of it. I was so pleased and warmed over watching this movie. My sister and I went on a quest to catch this movie at the theater because it was a small indpendent movie and some of the theaters that show these types of movies only have it for like one, maybe two weekends tops and airing at limited times per day. So we finally tracked it down in Santa Monica and were pleasantly pleased by its wholesomeness and innocence. Very well done! I'm glad it's out on DVD. This is something I'll watch over and over again!"
5,Great love story!,"This movie was beautifully written, directed and acted. I was very impressed with the soundtrack as well. Though the movie is not action packed, it is filled with well developed characters and interesting plot turns. The gradual love story that builds through the entire film is entertaining right up to the end. I would highly recommend this movie!"
3,"Good acting, moves slowly!!!!!!!!!!",The acting is very good and the scenery is spectacular.The movie tends to move alittle to slow....could have morestory especially after they marry.
3,Sweet Land,My wife and I saw the movie and really wanted to own a copy. The only thing we're not happy with is that the movie that was sent to us from the seller was a movie for review. Occassionally this message will pop up and annoy us. The movie itself is a great character study of turn of the century america.
5,My favorite,"This is my favorite movie. It is a sweet,poignant love story that takes place in the farmlands of Minnesota. It begins just after WWI and flashes forward to the present time. The acting is superb.It has an understated grace that is lacking in most films today and gives insight into the hard working people who made us proud to be a nation of immigrants.I think I'll watch it tonight!"
4,"A very ""sweet"" movie","We enjoyed this movie very much...enough to buy it after renting it. It's a love story, but includes a serious theme about prejudice as well. The genres are romance and historical fiction."
3,The title says it all.,"The positives of the movie are many. My grandfather's family moved to northern Iowa when he was 3 years old. Many of the stories I heard growing up resonated with this movie. The acting is good; however, I thought the Inge's German accent was poor. The story takes place in post war times. The movie addresses bigotry, love and bravery. When Olaf risks it all to save his friend's farm from the bank; it was a really touching moment.The negatives are minor. I mentioned the accent. The movie uses flashback sequences to tell the story. It gets confusing sometimes about who is remembering what. The production values are pretty high, but you can tell they took short cuts sometimes with the sets.It is a very good period piece about people who don't often get movie made about them but who built the country through their bravery, tenacity and hard work."
4,Love it!,"This is a great film, and I love it to pieces. The only reason I wouldn't give this five stars is that a lot of the non-English in it is just gibberish. Even when the actual languages are used, sometimes basic grammatical mistakes are made. If just a little more time had been taken on the non-English languages which are rather prominent in this movie I would enjoy it more. However like I said before this is a really good film in all other ways and I highly recommend it."
5,Sweet,"Close to real and closer to home. This was filmed not far from where I grew up, and the family could have been ours. From taking turns in the Saturday night tub to the heartbreaking threat of auctioning the farm, watching this film is like opening the family diary and reading it day by day, page by page. I never saw anyone cut corn with a sickle, but I saw the gnarled hands of the women who worked alongside their husbands in the fields of the sweetest land that was ever planted. If the writers told our story the actors have learned us by heart. I'll never forget the day the farm was auctioned. My dad played the harmonica as a way of bowing to the winds of change that blew so many farmers off the land. This film redeemed that experience and put it back into the book to remember. From the creaking wooden staircase to the unspoken satisfaction of a day's work well-done, this film is as real as they come. It may leave you refreshingly speechless."
2,Sweet Surprise,"I'm a movie lover, not a movie critic. This based-on-a-true-story vignette of Minnesota in the early 20th Century spoke to my heart, but broke it a bit with the bigotry evident in a pastor of a tiny little church. As my father would say, ''Heck-Fire, we are ALL immigrants!''Note: This would be an excellent film for a student to study how films are made because the actors and the writers discuss it afterwards."
3,Minnesota Gothic,"This is the story of a mail-order bride arriving in a farming town just after the First World War. She encounters prejudice because she's of German origin and the farmers are all of Scandinavian descent and the jingoism of the war is still rampant.The concept is excellent but it falls a bit flat because it's hard to care for the characters. They are constrained by the script calling for moral rigidity and social conformance and thus they seem mostly wooden.It's a story of pluck, fortitude, mutual cooperation and of our forefathers resolve to get on with life and for that it is praiseworthy. Unfortunately, passion in those days had to be left in the closet and only at the very end do they manage to open the door.The film has much to recommend it, now if only you could care about it as well."
2,Sting !,"Unless you like ""art-house"" films, you're going to feel like a fool for having bought this. You have been warned."
4,Seamanship,"Once Is Enough is more than enough, especially south of Cape Horn.Perserverance and seamanship at its best!Allows you a third chance at a successful attempt."
2,Sailing adventure and survival. Once is Enough,"A fine book of sailing adventure, daring,and demonstration of pure determination to survive infused with applied skills and love. With plenty of luck.Although not nearly the same, my enjoyment in reading this taleflows from duck hunting alone in near freezing temperatures de-parting the dock at the darkened hours of 4 - 5 a.m. --huntingexperiences that afforded me insight into and identity withMile's - Beryl's - and John's characters. They were fortunateto have survived!"
3,Expecting more,I thought the quality of this product would be better for being Reed and Barton. Unfortunately there aren't many other options. Besides the quality the spacers inside could be better designed.
2,"If you go to Iraq, you need a lot more than a book ...","This book was published pre-war and at least one of the authors was a long-time advocate of lifting sanctions and ally of John Pilger. It's terrible on the Kurdish regions.More up-to-date is Gilles Munier 'Iraq: an Illustrated History and Guide', although it lacks the details re hotels etc.Either might be of use - and or interest - to someone visiting. But surely no-one would be mad enough to rely on either for decisions about where to travel and where to stay: for either you must have up-to-date information from people on the ground whom you trust."
2,Not Joyner's Best,"First let me qualify my review in saying that I have ony read two of Joyner's pieces, ""Overcoming Witchcraft,"" and ""Overcoming the Accuser."" I did not think that ""Overcoming the Accuser"" was very good. The book did not seem to go in a logical order or really say very much at all. There were a few good points, however, which is why I gave it 2 stars and not just one. It's okay, but read his other stuff first!"
3,"Not Barry's best, but. . .","Many repetitive themes, but the main title is haunting and even mediocre Barry is better than what passes for soundtracks on most films today."
1,Why not tell us they are not the original artists?,"Just another ripoff collection of great tunes performed badly by second rate, no name performers. I wonder how many people buy albums like this, open them up, hear what's inside, and then feel like they've just been robbed because now the product has been opened and can't be returned. Interestingly, the links for listening to samples are always missing when someone doesn't want us to know what we're getting until it's too late."
5,Smartshopper,"A very beautiful necklace. Shiny pastel colors. The crystals really catch the light.Looks pretty with a white tee shirt, white really shows the colors off. The necklace arrived on time and in a pretty silver box.Gem Avenue is an excellent company- I have been pleased with every purchase."
5,Great necklace!,It's a really nice necklace and even better than the picture. Very vivid colous and you can wear it with almost everything! Great purchase at a great price!
2,Probably not the best choice.,"This necklace is not what you may expect, after going to some Swarovski stores you can tell it has ""other"" quality, maybe crystals come from Swarovski but the necklace is not similar to original ones, maybe it is a good gift for the price, but be sure what you want before order it."
2,Import only,This is a basic 2-d animation program only. You will first have to draw your image then import it. The drawing toolbar is extremely limited.
4,Do You Feel Like A Cartoon?,"If you at times feel like a cartoon character, now, this may become a reality thanks to the hardwork of the folks at e--frontier.With capabilities to import any image and add rigging to it,your dreams become a digital reality.Maybe I should've gave it a higher rating,but it did take some doings to get things to work (still a lil buggy?)An improvement is needed in the color pallette (to eliminate all the import/export for quality) and I'm still waiting for my rebate/discount as well as the promised extra content( I'm an artist so the extra wasn't that important,would like it tho).Look for my new cartoon coming someday to a web nearest you(google,veoh)."
1,DON'T PURCHASE,This adapter will not power what it says it will. It pretty much sucks if you are looking to power something strong.
4,Works Fine.,"Works great and was very easy to install. The lead is extremely long, much longer than I needed but I guess for some applications that would be needed."
4,Cobra CPI-A20 Remote Inverter Switch,"This product is very useful and convienent for turning on or off a cobra inverter that is in the trunk of a vehicle. The cable attached, is long enough for placing the remote swich in a location that meets the users needs. Power inverters can drain a battery after a period of time if left on and unattended especially when the vehicle's engine is off. To have a remote in a covienent location is a plus!"
1,"Overpriced, tiny light, non-functional","Wow, what a (bad) surprise. $25 for a switch and a light. The light is microscopically small (about 1/16"" x 1/4""), but it didn't work anyway, out of the box. Unfortunately, I had this item on my ""project shelf"" for a while, past the warranty, so I'm going to have to fix it myself. One LED should not be too hard to replace. The switch does work okay - - however, it's a push-on/push-off design, so the light absolutely HAS to be operational or you have no idea whether the inverter is on or off.Panel is nice-looking enough - - if they charged $15 and had a nice big LED so you could see it from any angle, it would be worth it. As-is, it's a bit of a rip-off, but sadly there is no alternative. If you want a remote panel for your inverter, design and build your own (pretty easy basic electronics) or pay Cobra their ransom and hope your panel works when you receive it. Better test it before the 30 days are up."
2,doesn't cover well,"This is my first splatter screen, so I don't know if all of them are the same. It covers some, but I still get beads of oil around the stove, and one day I had a big ""pop"" that went everywhere. I bought it over a year and so far I've used it maybe 5 times at the most because when I use it, I have to wash it and clean the stove and the floor. If I don't use it, I have to clean only the stove and the floor. In other words, I use it only when I know it's going to be very messy, so at least it's 1/4 less messy."
4,Splatter Screen,The Norpro Stainless Steel 13-inch Splatter Screen is well made and comes out of the dishwasher looking new. It surely beats the non-stainless screen versions I have purchased before.
4,Excellent DVD!,"Honestly if you never been to a concert of RBD's then this is a must see. You also get to see the behind the scenes which is really cool. I definitely recommend this DVD to all RBD fans and even if your not, you might be after this DVD. I think is great."
3,Thanks to the legendary Bert Kaempfert from Germany........,".....who composed ""Strangers in the Night"" and popularized that music through the distribution of his own phenomenally-selling LP's and audiophile-quality reel-to-reels, not only in the U.S. but worldwide, prior to Sinatra's lyricized release, Frank's plummetting career skyrocketed, so any foolish talk about Frank not liking this tune is ridiculous. What's more, Kaempfert's ""The World We Knew (Over and Over)"" contributed in a likewise crucial fashion to further Frank's recording career resurrection."
1,pathetic,"Whoever thought of bringing back and remastering this cd? It is a horror. For the most part, Sinatra's singing is forced, murky and lifeless.Firstly, Sinatra sings ""My Baby Just Cares For Me"" like a funeral dirge. It is supposed to be sang to a fast tempo.His rendition of ""Downtown"" lacks the excitement and vitality of Petula Clarke's original recording. EVEN WORSE, Sinatra makes a noise that sounds like a frog croaking or a long burp several times during the song! What's that all about? Being this crummy, the song never should have been included.And as to the 3 added ""bonus tracks,"" they are 3 of the same songs, but in a live version, that are already included on the CD. Ripoff city.I'm a big fan of Sinatra; however, these are the lowest standards ever employed on an album of his. It is shamefull that Concord ever realeased this disgrace."
4,Sinatra battles the British Invasion,"It's 1966, The aging ""Chairman of the Board"" fights to stay relevant in the midst of a changing musical climate. The British Invasion as well Acid Jazz continue to shape late 60's music. Sinatra with help from Nelson Riddle tap into this climate and yet still keep Sinatra's signature stamp on his music. Hence this album avoids getting caught in the Undertow! A definite 4 star album by Sinatra who remained relevant in 1966..This Remastered Classic contains a couple nice related bonus songs. Enjoy!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"This car dock is a piece of junk. If the song you are listening to has any bass at all, this dock makes it sound like a bunch of fuzz. I bought this because I saw the price and thought I would give it a shot. I tried out five radio stations and messed with it for about 15 minutes to make it sound better but there was no helping it. This just goes to prove you get what you pay for! It's better to just go ahead and invest in a nice one that's a little more expensive."
2,"I returned for exchange, but didn't get the ideam back","as I said, the iteam I received didn't work at all. I returned, and wait for the exchange."
3,I Can't See the Future Being Much Bleaker Than This,"This book is about as dark and horrible as a future can get. It's written as a children's book, but this is no book for kids. There's some pretty scary stuff and rather harsh language as well (he dropped a few f-bombs and the 11 year old main character was molested). Young adults, maybe. Kids, definitely not.The language of the kids reminded me a lot of the kids in the movie ""Mad Max : Beyond Thunderdome"". And there's the run-on sentence of all time - it's 3 pages long."
5,256m mem stick,"It's cheap, it's easy to install, it makes your computer run better (non gaming work computer) what's not to love?"
4,Excellent overview - but bring detailed maps!,"This is an excellent book, which can guide you through the beginning stages of choosing a route and planning your trip, but you had better bring a more detailed map - especially for the French river trips. The maps in the book along with the trip details probably are not enough."
5,"Admirable for its picture of Burma, too","The very best history of the famous defenders of Burma. Most people don't know that the Flying Tigers did most of their flying and fighting in Burma. They trained at Toungoo, did most of their fighting over Rangoon (Yangon), and retreated to Magwe and Lashio. What an epic! And what a good retelling of it."
5,Moving Comic Book Easy to Read,"This book cleverly tackles difficult subjects (e.g. 9/11, racial diversity, immigrant's fears and hopes, notions of cultural identity, and much more) in a highly original documentary-style that makes reading and absorbing the stories easy. It is so well-written and elegantly drawn that a teenager and an adult will immediately appreciate its contents. Each story is informative, reveals a bit of the human condition, and is often moving. It actively provokes discussion with others about issues and current events, but also gently opens a private window in one's heart to ""feel"" the suffering and struggle of others who yearn to overcome the challenges of life. If we are to fight oppression, bullies, fear, and terrorism and promote empathy, understanding, wisdom, integrity, and strength of character, this book must become required reading in schools."
1,9 of 1,"This dreadful piece of pap is an embarrassment. In an attempt to be ""politically correct"", the author has combined childish drawing with feeble prose. Don't waste your money, I'm sorry I did. This sort of books lessens the horror of living with terrorism, and is a failure as a teaching aid for children. Yuk!"
1,I want my evening back...,"After work, housework, dinner and laundry I like to sit and watch mindless comedies. This movies takes mindless to a whole new level! I kept watching it to the end though, waiting for it to get better. It NEVER got better. Filled with bad gags and even worse acting (Heather Graham with her blank stares and a cosmetic surgery nightmare Lara Flynn Boyle who's puffy frozen face had ZERO animation...)this movie was a complete waste of time and money! Someone should have aborted this project at the get-go!!"
1,This movie doesn't deserve any stars!!,"This movie is truly one of the most terrible ones I have ever seen. The movie is full of VERY vulgar, shocking content along with an overdone amount of mindless swearing and it has a very unbelievable, shallow plot. Blech. I wish I could forget this movie. This movie goes beyond crude. I could not believe the nudity and vulgarity in it. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"The premise is good, the actors notable ... what were they thinking !!!! The script was terrible, the acting horrible, obviously the directing was horrible. At first I thought this was a spoof .... but no .... it wasn't funny, it wasn't good."
2,Funny movie but terrible sound,"The movie it self was funny, but the hole experince was destroide by the terrible sound mix. Somtthng ,ust have gone terrible wrong in the Blu-ray mastering both the Dolby DD 5.1 and DTS 5.1 HD Master track were filled with echoes, tapping noice!!!!!"
1,95 MINUTES I WILL NEVER GET BACK!,"Here's 95 minutes I'll never get back. It starts out okay but then when they have to create excuses for a BIG communication problem it all goes downhill. Borderline male bashing doesn't help much either. Crude and vulgar jokes would make the creators of SOUTH PARK possibly blush. Well, maybe not but you get the idea. WHEN WATCHED: Oh God, don't remind me!; MY GRADE: F to D minus."
1,"Predictable, yet surprisingly awful","The DVD version of this movie would make a good coaster, or possibly a Christmas tree ornament. It could be broken and the shards used to perform an emergency tracheotomy. However, under no circumstances should you put this in your DVD player and attempt to watch it. If you do, you will be subjected to one of the most inane scripts ever written, performed by actors whose careers actually decline as you watch.There is no reason for this movie to exist, except perhaps as an object lesson on how not to make movies.Watch the INFINITELY superior ""Baby Mama"" instead."
1,Bad movie...Good HD 1080p,IT IS A BAD COMEDY WITH 1 OR 2 LAUGHS AND VERY VULGAR. THE ONLY POINT IS BECAUSE THE QUALITY OF THE BLU-RAY VERSION IS REALLY GOOD.
1,awful,the worst movie in the history of movie making. tell rino to stick to armour square beating on minorities his screenplay is as bad as ronald bernbergs breath
4,Good Movie,The movie arrived in a very timely fashion. The quality of the movie was good until the middle of the movie. In certain parts of the movie it stopped and perhaps up to a minute later it began again.
1,don't waste your money,This stuff does not work at all I didn't tingle or feel any kind of sensitivity. This was a total waste of money. If I could I would give this a negative 5 stars.
2,Nothing to get excited about,Purchased and tried .Wife complained that product felt itchy not something you want to hear about a sensitivity cream Overpriced for what you get .Would not purchase again
1,Useless,"What a waste of money! Absolutely no good, don't believe one word of those glowing reviews, it can't be that different. And,it smells bad. Get yourself a bottle of wine and some lubricant. Actually deserves minus points."
1,"this product is a fraud, it doesn't work . I spent whole tube and did not feel anything special, just a very wild irritation","this product is a fraud, I spent the whole tube and did not feel anything special,the only thing I got was a serious irritation in my vulva. be carefull with this product!"
5,Great Product,"I have been using this product for several years and I am very pleased. I'd previously tried several others to treat the decreased sensitivity associated with menopause and although they produced a feeling of irritation, they did not accomplish the purpose. This works perfectly."
3,it works for me,"I like using this when I feel more insensitive than usual, preperation is required for the body but the flavor of life is enhanced for an hour or so."
2,did not grab me,"I view series mysteries the same way I do junk food. Not as good for me as other choices, something to feel a little bit sheepish about enjoying, but still can be tasty. Unfortunately ""Murder Uncorked"" is the kind of junk food you wonder why you ate. The main character Nikki seemed contrived and unbelievable to me. I couldn't suspend disbelief to accept that her wine knowledge from reading in the library was good enough to impress a vineyard owner so that he offered her a job. When Nikki talks about wine, it just seems so phony (and I'm not a wine expert). None of the characters were all that likeable to me. Wealth and good looks seem to be most admired characteristics. The recipes were really the best part of the book."
4,Murder Uncorked,"When Nikki finds a dead body, she goes into detective mode. Even tho she is not a real detective, she has played one in a tv series. So as she is trying to uncover the murder she has to try diferent disguises so the people in the area would not recognize her. This is a good, quick read with interesting characters in a beautiful setting. The book also has recipes with wine pairings. A great first book in a series that makes me want to read the next book.This review was written for Connie's Book Review and More on Facebook."
1,Not worth your money,"The recipes and wine suggestions are all right, but the plot is improbable, and the characters are badly drawn. People fall in love for no particular reson and murder one another for even fewer reasons. It took me forever to wade through it even though it is a short easy read."
2,Enjoyable but not recommended,Ultimately the ending was so outrageous that it took away from the rest of the story. I would not recommend it to anyone for that reason. I've already given my copy away.
4,Style of the early WHO,"Guitar riffs and drums (although there will never be another Keith Moon), that seem to pay homage to The Who of the early seventies. A very good tight sound that makes you yearn for a time in music history that was filled with drive and ""action"". irve"
5,ROCK SOLID,"I got turned on to Jon Butcher back in the 80's and became a fan of his music and caught him in action twice. I lost track of him until a friend turned me on to this disc. This is not the Jon Butcher Axis but this has to be one of the best things Jon has done. The songs and the guitar playing are top notch and I have always loved Jon's voice. He and the band are in fine form. Good rockin' blues-based jams and there isn't a bad track on the disc. This disc rocks! One of my favorite tracks is Drinkin' Again, a slow blues track with some heartfelt vocals by Jon and a great guitar solo. Get this disc, you won't be sorry.www.electriceyes.us"
5,Stellar work from the Barefoot Servants...,"I came across a CD of this group's work, quite by accident almost 10 years ago... and fell in love with the gritty bluesy sound of the 'Barefoot Servants' immediately. From Jon Butcher's gravely vocals that clearly reflect the fire in his soul, to the electric artistry of Ben Schultz' guitar accompanyment, this debut CD works out to be a clear treat for any blues enthusiast. From the sardonic humor of 'Foolish Behavior', to the barroom brallish excitement of 'Muscle Car', you'll agree that this album is an excellent addition to your personal collection."
1,this is an outdated firewall not new same firewall as 2004 ca,This is not the new 3 user 2009 personal firwall it has the old screenshot of the one in 2002-2006.. It is so outdated and only has 1 yr license.. Got it from ca for free in 2004 with the anitvirus for free too eggads
3,Law and Order Fans Will Enjoy!,"Unlike some of the other reviewers on this page, I not only had no problem running the game, but also greatly enjoyed it. (I was even able to run it on an old G3 Powerbook that technically didn't meet sys requirements.) I think the significant thing about this game's playability for me was that my wife (who never plays video games, but is a Law and Order fan) was quite addicted. The puzzles are not overly complicated, but the story is and it is the storyline that the gamemakers are relying on to draw you in. It has all the twists and false leads of a L&O episode. Jerry's voice, may he rest in peace, urges you along. Yes, there is no gun slinging and blood and violence, and perhaps that is what most game players like today, but for fans of the show it gives you a worthwhile and entertaining interactive episode."
1,Don't buy this game,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. I cannot get it to work on my brand new eMac.C'mon, ASPYR, get this fixed."
2,Okay but not the best.,I bought this at a used book store. I only like about 3 of the quilts in the entire book. One of which being the cover quilt. The cover quilt is an adorable look that can be improvised for your own personal color scheme. My gripe aabout the book is that you have to adjust some of the pattern pieces (not full size) or trace them and all of the quilts are too tiny to be functional -- but they are very time consuming. If you can get it cheap it's worth it -- otherwise forget it. Erin
2,Little information in this little book,"The pictures of the quilts in this book are great, but my problem is with the directions - there are too few of them!The book assumes a lot on the part of the reader, so if you don't have at least 3 or 4 quilts under your belt, pass on this book. Its directions are confusing and it neglects to tell you how much fabric is needed for each project (something that's handy and useful to know when going to the fabric store)."
4,Wonderful movie,"We got the movie is a shorter time than predicted, I purchased it used but new condition. It was visibly marked on the disk so I expected some skipping and it did. It is still playable but the beginning credits get stuck and tough to FF to the main menu and the last track skips that it is necessary to turn it off. I will reorder for a new copy."
4,"Great stories, lots of fun","My kids love this DVD. The stories are fun and the bug culture quite original--drawing from human cultural festivities. Great life lessons too. Child adored, mom approved, what's not to like."
5,Excellent. Very informative and interesting.,"Good historical insights and information. The key players are interviewed. Amazingly, the decisions that led up to the wall coming down were nothing but mistakes. A minister released information at a press conference that he wasn't supposed to release -- that's what set it in motion. This is a fascinating and interesting documentary."
1,Self Published Drivel,"The ""author"" has self published a screed full of lies. Millions of children die each year for one reason and one reason only: because they have no access to vaccines. Do not buy this book if you want to find any real information on this topic. Instead read better books on this topic by true experts such as Dr. Paul Offit."
1,Every child has the right to medical treatment.,"This book is spreading dangerous ideas. Vaccination protects society and people who refuse are a danger to public health and should be shut out of society. We don't need to go back to the dark ages. The medical authorities recommend vaccination because it is the most effective way of preventing disease.The World Health Organization says that every child has the right to medical treatment. They also have the right to not be infected by a ""vaccine free"" child."
3,Vaccine concerns,A good article on vaccines and there possible effects. Found some of the ideas quite interesting despite contradicting standard medical practices.
2,Very Poorly Written,"While I would like to rate this book more highly because of the good information that it contains, I cannot recommend it. It is extremely poorly written, and there is no bio of the author. This is a controversial topic and non-vaxers are bucking the mainstream, which means that they need to be extra meticulous when making the case against vaccines. There are better resources out there, skip this one."
2,Poorly written,"I was also very disappointed in the poor writing/editing. There is some good scientific information in this book but it's very poorly organized. Most of the book talks about the harmful effects of vaccinations and not about ""raising a vaccine free child"" as the title suggests. The author gives no credentials or BIO. She only covers a few of the vaccine preventable diseases. She is obviously extremely anti vaccination so this would not be a suitable book for someone who is still undecided or coming from the mainstream."
4,"A good starting place, in spite of all the typos","This book is a good place to start if you have been tasked with starting up an intranet. While it is a bit repetitive, the author makes her case for important issues like user-centered design, the criteria of a successful intranet and moving away from the first of four models of an intranet. It will expose you to the most important issues surrounding the design, implementation and running of an intranet.The book is really let down by its poor editing; be prepared for, on average, one typo per page and quite a few grammatical errors as well. I find these niggles irritating and inexcusable, especially from a publisher like Prentice Hall."
4,Good,It surprises me that this book is already out of print. I read every Wallace book I can find and this is the most complete I've seen.
3,3 only because Miss Parkers HOT!!,"My wife and I loved watching this show as a series... where we lived they never played the two movies. I came across this DVD and bought it hoping for a great story and some closure. I missed the characters, if the review was just about Miss Parker I would have given her 5 stars... the story could have been alot better. put some colorful discriptive words in here .... about the producers, studio or who ever the greedy money gubbing idiot was who came up with the stupid story and it's conclusion, what hoping for a bunch of sequel DVDs or a new series. and why are companies so cheap they couldn't throw in a few bloopers, extras or something whats wrong with those greedy cheap... try thinking like a fan and give us something without asking for an arm and a leg."
1,Sucks!,"Ok, don't get me wrong, I love Michael T. Weiss and the cast, but these were the worst extensions of the series. Now the Pretender 2001 was so, so, but the Island of the Haunted was completely stupid.I don't know if the writers were licking on a crack pipe before they sat down to do the script, or what, but this was the worst episode by far. I don't like Michael T Weiss with long hard and he's getting a little too heavy there also. Too much weight Michael! It seems nobody put any thought into making the movie. I'm not one for the voodoo magic crap, or whatever the hell it was about, it just wasn't up to the high standards of the tv series. If they decided to bring the series back, please good back to the original writing techniques that catapulted the tv show into a fan pleasing frenzy."
5,The Pretender / The Pretender - Island Of The Haunted,DVD was very entertaining.DVD arrived in a very timely fashion.DVD arrived in excellent condition.
4,the suspense goes on...,"These movies are ""The carry forward"" story of the series from where it was left and the suspense is still on .The story has not missed it's pace and both the movies will keep you at your chair's edge.But in the end you are still left for wanting more...The end question everybody is asking is when is the sequele coming to rid us of the end to the whole saga !!!"
4,Still waiting,"I enjoyed seeing the 'familiar' faces come back, e.g. Angelo, Mr. Raines, but talk about cliff hangers...I'm still waiting for movies 3 and 4 to finish out the series. Please, please, please don't leave us hanging on..."
4,"Still, not the end i was expecting for the series",i enjoyed the films very much but i am still not satisfied with the way the series ended. A lot of questions remained unanswered and even more emerged at the end. Overall great work but one more film is crucial for the completion of the series.
4,Good Product,Fine product. I enjoy this series very much and was glad to see the concluding TV movies which are now available on DVD. Very enjoyable and entertaining.
4,The Pretender movies covers a lot..and still there is questions,"The Pretender was a show that intriged and interested me. It was the Fugitive, part Quantum Leap (without the Leaping) and part Soap Opera/mystery plot.These two TV movies,both made especially for TNT network in 2001, are, in my opinion, a expanded version of the TV show episodes. The original cast is all here, and It seem like the shows was almost never canceledThese two TV movies answer a few questions and asks more, leaving the door open to future TV Pretender movies which never came to pass..and that is too badIf you are a fan of this series, these two movies will enhance your collection. If not, the Prentender 2001 will bring the whole four season show (all available on DVD) into hazy focus.Either way, these two movies have quality...rare in TV movies these daysBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
3,Good But Still Left Hanging,"I enjoyed getting another taste of Pretender with the movies, but wish the producers would have put closure for a future made-for-TV movie,once they knew they wouldn't be coming back. Although Crossing Jordon went on hiatus, but came back. P2001 was better than Island of the Haunting - I hate it when series get's too into non-reality, especially when the show's premise was not. However, I will always be a die-hard Pretender fan, and think Michael T Weiss, Andrea Parker, & James Denton (now on Desperate Housewives) are great actors. It was a cult hit, and a sleeper, regardless of what the critics say. It was truly entertaining."
5,3rd MOVIE is needed!!,"These movies have all the elements that made the series so successful: great writting, brilliant acting, good storyline and... keeping the viewers guessing. They are, in my option, to good at this and that is what cost it some of the fans.They didn't answer all the questions in season 4, then the show got cancelled, but the fans fought and got them another shot, but along with the answers that were given in ""Pretender 2001"" came a whole bunch of new questions. And with ""Island of the Haunted"" they did it again-they left us hanging.But I understand that originaly a '3 movie' contract was signed - so they thought they had another movie to work with. That is why i am still hoping, along with all the other Pretender fans, that the people that can make it happen, will give us a thrid movie - so that a show that had such a GREAT start can have a great end as well."
2,"Still not enough, and for that price??","I saw these movies when they were originally broadcast. While the first was intriguing, it brought more questions than answers. The second was all over the map, and we were left hanging with so many storylines unfinished that it was worse than not having a movie. I own and love seasons 1 through 4, but I don't think these two movies are worth it unless you have to own absolutely every piece of the series. It would be SO much better if the movies had tied up loose ends. Not only that, but they are charging the same price for two television movies as they did for each season of the regular series."
5,The Pretender - Island of the Haunted,I just bought and received the two movies: Pretender 2001 and The Island of the Haunted. I advice everyone to buy it! The second movie is wonderful and I wish it could have lasted forever! Please make more of these movies!!!!
3,You have to watch it but it's really not as good as the show,"If you are a fan of the Pretender show you have to watch the movie. I would have to say overall the movies are really not that good. First I did not like Jarod's new hairdo, petty I know but I definitely liked his short hair better. Second the TV series was canceled do you think they could reunited him and his mother or whole family for that matter or even solve some of the riddles that were never answered? I feel that was very poorly done that they (power on high) had an opportunity to finish the series and all they did was leave more questions and more unanswered riddles and came up with a hugely fantastical story line. I really didn't appreciate that they try to be 'artistic' instead of telling a great story. Overall I have to say I was disappointed with the movies."
3,The last two...,"I am sorry but I didn't think this was much of an ending to a series that asked more questions than it answered! Practically nothing was ever finished so it was a waste of time to even make these two movies. Also, the bylines got more and more weird. By the time you watch these two movies you have learned nothing else even remotely worth learning!!I give it a three since it is The Pretender."
5,Pretender Great Movies,"I loved the series, 4 seasons was not enough, luckily the decided to make 3 movies, only 2 were created but 2 is still more than none!Pretender 2001 was a good movie, where season 4 ends, 2001 continous. Great acting, great story. The second movie is even better, truly a good story with a lot of plots and twists you've come to expect from this show.A must have for every Pretender fan and even when you just liked this show, the movies are a joy to watch."
4,"Love the pretender show, and the movies keep it going.","The movies are great. They continue the story right where they left off, though they don't finish the story off. That's quite irritating. The Pretender 2001 side had some trouble at the start of each chapter, which is why I only gave it 4 stars."
5,WOW,"This was a great ending to the series, but would have liked to see more. It was a good change to see Jaron and Miss Parker work together to try and uncover both of their pasts."
3,Print quality should be better,"This DVD of Dick Tracy 1937 has a much better print than the VHS tape set that I bought years ago but it leaves a lot to be desired. I was expecting a 5 rating when it arrived but 3 is the best I could do. The commentary is interesting about the Tracy character but I wish there had been talk about how VCI came about to obtain this print etc. and why the quality could be better, but there was nothing. He also talks about the upcoming release of the other Tracy serials but they had better be of better print quality than this or I will just stick to my VHS set."
2,it was ok....,"there were some complaints. first, it took some time for it to be shipped out (4 days). i had it shipped expedited 2-3days and it took 6 days to get to my house. second, its cheaper on the website (10% off). third, three of the diamonds were really dull and under size compared to the other ones. the necklace wasn't as sparkling as the photo showed."
5,Most accurate way to set up an air shock.,This is a great product. Best way to set up a bicycle suspension fork or air shock. Very accurate gauge and no loss of air when removing it. This gauge is intended for bicycle shocks and not tires.
2,DON'T get depressed if you can't depress a Presta!,"As Mr. Shagui wrote, this gauge won't work on a Presta because the pin inside the gauge body is too far up inside to depress the Presta. Now, I'm depressed. So, I sent it back today. I also have an Accugauge for the Schrader valves. 2 brass adapters I have wouldn't allow this gauge to work for much the same reason. In this case, it was the length of the adapters that prevented the union. I turned them down on my lathe so the gauge would do it's job. Obviously, you can't check mating distances when an item like this comes from Amazon. And you can't make things fit if you don't have a lathe. But good to know you can just label them defective (which this one is), and get free return shipping and a full refund. GO AMAZON!"
3,Item is OK,"The first one I bought broke on the first use. I called Topeak, followed their replacement requirements and waited. I guess they lost my e-mail. Because after I sent another e-mail a month later, with their required return information,they replied that they did not see the first e-mail and would send out a replacement. They did and I received it about a week later. I haven't used the replacement yet so I can't say how durable it is."
4,Top noth and a very fine precision instrument,"If you like to be exact in your tire pressure, this is the instrument you need.If you like to put you tire pressure in a quick and exact manner, and be able to fine tune the presure on the field, this is your tool.Very well manufactured, being finish, product quality and all this in a very neat pouch.This item does 100% what it's advertised to do, and very professional.Go for it, you won't be sorry at all.Myron E. Jacobs"
3,I know I'm gonna change that tune.,"""That's Life"" was Frank Sinatra's last Top Ten hit, not counting his #1 hit duet with daughter Nancy. It's a classic song, which is the best thing about this album. The rest of the album is a mixed bag. Some good songs, some not so good songs. ""What Now My Love"" and ""The Impossible Dream"" are probably the best. ""Winchester Cathedral"" is a misguided attempt to be ""contemporary"", but it's actually fun, in a goofy kind of way. Most of the other songs are rather forgetable. This album will probably only be of interest to serious Sinatra fans."
1,TERRIBLE record !,"If you're a fan of Sinatra's Capitol years, of Sinatra the swinger, Sinatra the great saloon singer, the ring-a-ding Sinatra, or Sinatra the brokenhearted loser, just keep off from that record, stay away, BEWARE!This record is absolutely dreadful. It features Ol' Blue Eyes' worst ever arranger, Ernie Freeman, who was responsible for taking the aging Sinatra into the realm of middle-of-the-road pop. If you dislike ""Strangers In The Night"" (I know I do), then you'll get just the same kind of garbage with this record.This is a hardcore fan speaking here... I wouldn't speak evil of that record if there was any redeeming feature to it, only I can see none! So stick to the 1954-1964 Sinatra, and you'll never go wrong. After that, it takes a little listening before you buy the stuff. Albums arranged by Nelson Riddle, Billy May, Gordon Jenkins or Neal Hefti are keepers... As for the ones by Don Costa and Ernie Freeman, well, you can't say you haven't been warned!"
4,Good album. Bad Reviews by HORRIBLE REVIEWERS,That's my take on this. It's not perfect. But it's also a good album by many other standards. Part of the problem is people keep trying to compare Sinatra to Sinatra. Either way it's still the same guy-SINATRA. He moved forward. Why don't some of you? I own the vinyl and now the cd. :)
4,Adequate,"Lots of songs (most complete US hits), but some that scored in the UK only. Remastering quality wasn't ideal, but I'd give it an Adequate+ grade.Possibly remixed some songs."
3,It is what it is,"OK, I needed to replace a worn out wheel on my lawnmower & this one fit...and it looked really good when I received it. That gets them the 3 stars. But this thing is already wearing out just like the last one (different manufacturer). I bought this in July 2011. Personally, I think that this wheel is showing too much wear after a season & a half. I guess the gravy train is in replacement parts."
3,Great - When the batteries are charged,The product works as advertised as long as you plan to switch out the battery once per week. This would not be too much of a challenge except for the fact that the built in charger does not function. The net result was a frustrated wife and kids.I have since purchased the Harmony 890 and no longer use the Smarthome product.
5,Excellent remote transmitter,This product coverts IR remote signals to radio and then back to IR. This a great product to use so you can control a tv from another room or hide your cable/satellite box.
5,"Excellent Book for Nevada, Arizona Gardeners","I just finished reading this book and found it to be an excellent source for desert gardeners. The authors are long time desert gardeners themselves and it shows. The book is easy to use, easy to understand, well-written, and quite comprehensive. A great deal of plant material is covered here.The sections on growing lawns under hot, desert type conditions are especially good, and are obviously the result of many years of hands-on, practical experience.Much gardening reading material is not of much use for people living in areas like Las Vegas, Nevada, but this material certainly is.If I had but one gripe about the book, it is that it does not cover allergies caused by landscape plants very well. But then, not many gardening books do."
5,Gardener's Delight,"This is one of the most comprehensive books that covers all the geographical areas of Nevada. It has a wonderful cross section of plants suitable for the cold climates as well as the desert of Southern Nevada.The authors are both respected professionals in this field, and you can trust what they say. Unlike other volumes that have more pictures than text, this one gives information that is usable.This would be the best gifts you could give to someone that wants to enjoy getting thier hands dirty and their yards beautiful."
2,"Good book for Southern Nv, not so helpful for Northern Nv.","I recently moved from the central coast of California to Northern Nevada. Being an avid gardener, I was concerned as to what type of gardening I was going to be able to enjoy in my new home. I purchased this book prior to moving and was totally frustrated. This book leads you to believe that nothing grows in northern Nevada. Imagine my surprise when I arrived and found an abundance of plants to choose from. Some of the plants that were suppose to be forbidden for my area were growing heartily! The author's are from the Las Vegas area and really don't know much about gardening in the northern part of the state."
5,Speaks to a Woman's Heart,"I just finished reading All Together in One Place, and feel like I have been living and traveling with Jane Kirkpatrick's wonderful cast of characters on their long and dusty journey. This is probably the best book I have read in quite some time. It is engaging and thought provoking, and extremely well written. I came to care about the women, and cried over their sorrows and rejoice with their victories. Ms. Kirkpatrick really did her homework and created a story that speaks true to that time and yet is still relevant in our time. It lays around your heart like a well-worn sweater. In fact, I have decided not to start the next book in the series right away so I can just live with this story for a little while longer."
2,Slow and unsure,"This is my first read by Jane Kirkpatrick. It will most likely be my last. This book really was such a slow read! I actually had a few conversations with friends about this book stating that I need to be ok with putting aside a book that I really do not like. I usually try to always finish a book I start. This one I wish I would of done this. Loose ends were hanging all over the place. On page 313 (of my hardbound copy) we get the idea that one of the main characters (Ruth) is finally going to get to meet her foe, then on the next page it is is just idle chatter. It makes no sense, though I read this section over & over trying to get the drift. Thinking is there a page missing, did I turn two at once etc. I found this book really just paragraphs of this & that with VERY weak characters, I did not cheer or hate anyone in the book. Blah. I gave it a rating two only because there was a bit of history in it that was interesting but even this was weak and perhaps a tad too fabricated."
2,thumbs down,"I started this book with gusto. The writing was well done, the character's well developed, the speed moving along nicely. The first couple of chapters had quite a bit of action and was a page turner...and then middle of the book-bam...nothing. The story gets slooooow. Suddenly the author is going on and on about things in the characters lives that are uninteresting and of little point. The action dies completely. I struggled on, thinking it would pick back up, but gave up on the last 70 or so pages. I didn't even have enough interest to find out what happened to the characters and just felt cheated at having spent the time I did reading it. Would not recommend."
2,A Book of Platitudes,"This book was a big disappointment. The story line had an interesting premise, and I was really looking forward to reading it. The dialogue between the characters was so filled with ""homilies"" and ""down-home"" truisms that it distracted from the story line. I had to force myself to finish this book, and found myself saying out loud, ""Oh please, give me a break!"" The unrealistic dialogue made the characters unbelievable. I certainly would not recommend this book and do not intend to read any more books by this author unless she works on her dialogue."
1,Dissappointed,"I like historical fiction, so I thought this would be a good book. However, I thought the writing was terrible and I wouldn't read any more of the series."
1,It took me TOO long to finish this book.,"I was attracted to this book, because I thought it would give me an historical accounting of personal experiences on the Oregon Trail. The book does offer that. However, I had a hard time staying interested. It was hard keeping track of the characters - if I had a nickle for everytime I turned to the page listing Cast of Characters, I could have paid for the book. This book moves very slow, there is not much action or suspense. Much time is spent on emotions and personalities. I can see where some readers would love this book - but it is not my style."
3,Heading west with regrets,"I thought that the begining of this book started off well, but as I continued reading, the plot seemed to diminish.The author seemed to avoid being predictable, and her solution was death. Many times you would assume one thing would happen, but in the next paragraph, the character would die.Not to say this is a bad book, in fact I liked it a bit and finished reading it. However, I think much more could have been done with the characters and the plot.Other than that, a nice version of the Oregon Trail and a decent read if you have a lot of time on your hands."
3,All together...so-so!,"I picked this book off a bookstore shelf because historical fiction interests me...and this book lived up fairly well to my expectations except in one area. Characterization. I felt the author gave a very black and white sketch of Mazy's emotions and personality. She was either content or not content. Even when tragedy stikes the troup of wagons, I could not understand Mazy's reaction or lack of reaction, mainly because her character is so underdeveloped. Mazy feels like a character in a silent movie, you see her actions but you don't get any sense of what she thinks or feels. However, the plot was good and the book held my interest fairly well. I will attempt to read the next two in the trilogy. I hope they are better!"
3,"Interesting, but not riveting","I enjoyed this book. It was a slow read, because it contained a LOT of detail. Though it may not have been accurate in all repects, it gave me a feel for what if might have been like to strike out to the unknown and settle our land. Imagine....clean water is not always available....no shelter from the elements...either extreme heat OR wicked storms...no running to the store when the wagon breaks down....abandon some of your most prized possesions by the side of the road in order to survive. And of course, in the book as well as in our history of westward expansion, many did NOT survive! It gave me a new appreciation for my ancestors and the courage it must have taken to move from the known to the unfamiliar. Though I didn't find the book riveting, it was worth reading, and I look forward to continuing the saga."
3,Finally,"This is a 3 1/2 Star movie, and the best of the 8 Films to Die For, though I haven't seen Snoop's movie yet. All of the films suffer a little from low budget, so things are kept to a minimum. The story really only involves a handful of characters, and in all only 13 people even show up on the screen for the entire film including backround characters. The film is about a woman searching for her past. She flies to Russia to find out about her mother who died when she was an infant. She is told that her mother is dead and she has inherited her run down house in the middle of nowhere. That is when the action begins as the woman slowly pieces together her lost past. This isn't a perfect horror film, but the mood and music are terrific. The middle of the film dragged a little, but the ending was very good and the whole movie was fairly original. If you are going to see one of the After Dark films, I would pick this one."
5,This Book would win Cannes or Sundance if it were a Movie,"I actually bought 20 copies last month and gave them to ""certain"" people to read and they were taken by the words and impressed by the author content, and someone said that Brad Pitt may have had expressed interest in this book. Maybe a movie will follow but I think it has ALL the potential of becoming one very soon, I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't.Good Luck Paul. Great Job!"
2,Tedious,"I've been slowly knocking off the Ramage novels, but after this one I'm taking a hiatus. Ramage, our hero, is sent to France as a spy, so we have more intrigue than action. Fine. This should have been a great thriller, but it turns out to be a long, tedious, even boring novel. Pope just can't say in 3 pages what he can say in 50 and it wears thin after a while. Most naval fiction novels consist of a series of episodes, but Pope's books tend to be one long story. Nothing wrong with that, but if there is nothing to keep you interested, then reading it becomes a chore. And that's what this is."
1,Sunk With No Survivors.,"This is a superficial and forgetable effort at historical writing. Heavily padded because of a very thin plot, all of what passes for action is carried by secondary characters sometimes acting off-stage, as Ramage, the ""hero"", spends pages ruminating on his navel. The author tries to flaunt his research by inserting unnecessary multi-page historical data which add nothing, while stopping the weak story in its tracks. In the end, the plot works, and the hero is triumphant only by coincidence, resourceful secondary characters, and ignorant villians. This was the first Pope book I have read (and the last) and does not compare in any way with the works of Conrad,O'Brian, Forester or Kent."
3,Looks Good,"We got this door and it looked good (strong and well made). It didn't fit our door even though we measured it. So, next time I will purchase from a store where I can go back and return it. This company will accept our return, but the price was so high that we kept the door and hope to sell it in a garage sale sometime in the future. I would purchase the same door but I will need to go to the store. It was my mistake not to check the return policy. So, please check that before you purchase."
1,returning at my own expense,"blind did not ""exactly""fit our door even after careful measuring so we chose to return ....which cost half what the blind did...BUYER BEWARE!!!"
3,Almost a bargain,"I ordered two units at a very attractive price. However, all six batteries arrived in a corroded condition and had to be replaced. Might be some connection between that and the price. You can buy the batteries online for a lot less than you would spend at a store.These units (and others that look the same) utilize little laser pointers that have been modified with set screw adjustments. Out of the box they don't aim true (or even close), and it's very difficult to make the adjustments. Do not overtighten the set screws! If you strip the aluminum threads, it's all over. Leave everything on the verge of being loose, take take your time, and keep your cool.The sights aren't bright enough for daylight use, but are fine for night use. The clamp will fit a 20ga. shotgun barrel, perhaps larger sizes."
2,junk,"this laser sight will not hold zero for anything. seems well built but i would advise people to stay away from this laser sight, spend a lil more money and get a good one."
4,Good Laser Sight,This is a good laser sight. I mounted mine on a sawed-off shotgun. The red dot from a laser sight scares the hell out of any intruder. He knows you mean business. I bore sighted it first. The sight adjustment screws are very difficult to use. For the price this is an excellent sight.
4,great for cheap laser,great working laser for the price & easy to set up. came in with a bad switch but one call to NCStar & they are sending me a new one for free. Cant beat that.
2,Cool for Paintball!!!,"Nice little affordable attachment for a paintball gun, Would not recommend for a real rifle. It's just mainly for looks, there's not really anyway to line it up. When I put it on my paintball gun I had to use tape to put it on an angle so it would be some what aligned. If you don't it is perfectly straight which means it will be well below your barrel. If you want a laser on your paintball gun, This is a cheap way to have one."
3,Easy Install/Sight Adjust - But Inconsistent,"This product mounts easily and you can adjust the laser perfectly with your sights. The only problem I've had is the ""perfect"" adjustment won't stay that way for long after a little combat. I took it off my rifle and put it on my scenario paintball gun for looks. Overall for the price it is a good buy but only for recreational uses or indoor airsoft/paintball."
3,Paintball Universal Laser Sight,The Universal Laser Sight is a good purchase for the price. If you're playing outdoors in the daylight it serves no purpose but it looks cool.
1,stay away from ncstar products,remember the saying: that you get what you pay for. the one i purchased did not work.I have also had experience with other items in this manufacturers line up.spend the extra money for a good unit or you will be wasting time in returns.its not worth the chance you may get a good item.
4,rifle laser sight,"i have 4 NcStar laser sights & for the $ they r well worth the price..... only annoyance i've had is getting them to zero in spot on 100%.... just a weee bit off so u learn to adjust the shot ever so slightly.... great for nite time shooting of javelina where 1.5"" at 100' ain't bad w/a running 4'x2' pig...."
2,ONE Shot,"Purchased this laser sight from Outdoor Bunker for about fourteen bucks. Worked well when the cats chased it. Mounted it to my .22 pistol. After one shot, it wouldn't work anymore. Yes, the price IS too good to be true.1/2/11 update: When I bought this, it was titled, ""Universal Rifle Laser Sight."" Now that it is titled, ""PAINTBALL Universal Laser Sight For Gun Barrel,"" it may not fail after just one shot.3/9/11 Update: For some reason I didn't throw this away when it failed. To my surprise, it started working again. Still not suitable for a .22, but is probably OK for a paintball gun. I upgraded my review to 2 stars because it wasn't a total loss. I can entertain the cats with it. :)"
3,Shouldn't this cat be dead by now?,"I could never understand the success of Garfield. For thirty years this fat feline has recycled three or four jokes. He hates Mondays, he doesn't chase mice, he loves lasagna, and kicking a stupid dog off the counter.If he isn't in bed, he's on the counter talking with his owner Jon who is rarley seen below the shoulders. He is a loser and Garfield must constantly remind him of that too.Anyone who is a serious Garfield fan is as easily entertained as a three year old."
5,Awesome,This is a awesome book! Read it l! AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS
5,Greater than all the other's,Great for kids to read this book it will not be challenging to read about this fat cat also very lazy
5,Survival of the fattest,"What haven't I said about Garfield that I have already said before? Congratulations to Garfield in giving the public his 40th book of non-stop laughter. I grew up on Garfield the cat since the early '80s. Twenty + some years later, Garfield is still fat and still funny as ever. In his 40th book, Garfield is still up to his same tricks; making fun of Jon, abusing Odie, squashing spiders, and matching wits with Nermal the world's cutest kitten. I particularly love seeing Garfield squash spiders. It was good seeing Nermal make a brief appearance. I always loved it when Nermal would come to visit Garfield and antagonize the fat cat with his one-liners. No matter how old I am, I can never tire of reading the fat cat's antics. Jim Davis can do no wrong."
5,mudvayne- l.d. 50,this is a great tab book. It's kind of hard to tab mudvayne by ear but this is dead on. I would recomend it to anyone who wants a challenge.
2,"Flimsy, useless warranty","This was a great device for the month that it worked. But unless you use the included USB extension cord, it's highly vulnerable to getting bonked. The carrying case doesn't have a place for the extension cord, and sure enough mine got whacked. The USB connector bent and no longer functions. Iomega says there's nothing they can do -- they can't be repaired.Keep in mind that this is a fragile unit that can't be fixed if you break it, which sure takes the fun (and utility) out of it fast.A mini hard drive with a built-in flex connector, rather than a rigid swivel connector like this has, would be more reliable."
3,"Wilton 1 hp grinder, NOT","I bought the Wilton i hp grinder because of the price and the great Wilton name.The grinder seems OK, vibrates a bit more than i would like but that seems to be the fault of the grinding wheels themselves.However, this is NOT a 1 hp grinder. My grinder said 5 amps not 7 and so can only be, at most, 1/2 hp.Needless to say, I was not happy with the misrepresentation.K. KlemmSharon Springs NY"
5,Great Grinder for the price,Does every thing I want it to without bogging down.Add Amazon prime shipping and you cant go wrong..
5,So soft!,"My boyfriend ran with the bulls in Spain and got his arm run over by one of them. I wanted to find him a welcome home gift, so I got him this little toro - a soft bull that could run over his arm and not hurt him :) He thinks I'm ridiculous, but he had to admit that it was sooo soft and he really loves it!"
4,Master Fly Tying Guide,"For those of us who have been at this sport for awhile this book was and still is a standard for every tiers bench. It is a composite of several contributing authors each highly photographed and filled with pointers both basic and advanced. The authors are; Art Flick, Ed Koch, Lefty Kreh, Ted Niemeyer, Carl Richards, Ernest Schwiebert, Helen Shaw, Doug Swisher and Dave Whitlock."
4,"Good buy, at a reasonable price","This DVD player is a good buy for the price. I purchased this item quite some time ago, and it has definitely lived a long life life living with 5 guys who watch DVD's all day. It has great clarity, and the VSS sound is great for those of us who can't afford Dolby Digital sound. Overall it is worth the price because Panasonic is a good brand. I am satisfied, and that is not easy sometimes!"
2,Panasonic DVD-RV20 DVD Player,"Over All, The DVD Player Is OK, But It has It's Faults. For example,#1. It Doesnt Support MP3 CD's,#2. It Doesn't Read CD-R's.#3. It Doesnt Play Video Disc's.It Says That It Supports Video CD's, Yeah Of Course It Plays DVD's but It Doesn't play video disc's burned to a CD-R. I Would Not reccommend this DVD player to anyone. It Doesn't Do much of anything."
3,Glock caps,This cap run very small its ok! These caps are like for kid they cut the cap in half.its ok for shooting range!
3,Warning for big heads,This is a nice cap but it barely and I mean barely fits my head. It's a velcro fastener in the back so I will probably try and add some sort of velcro extension for a better fit. Your mileage may vary.
3,Rust,"This mailbox is made of heavy gauge steel and well made, however after about three months the upper rim of the opening started to rust. I had to purchase paint and sandpaper to refinish around the inner rim of this mailbox. I feel that a mailbox that cost this much should last longer than three months without rusting."
4,It's pretty good...,"This is a good album, however, if your not a hard-core fan of CCLPA, you shouldn't start with this album...In my opinion, it is kind of a ""Collection Finisher"" And it sound almost EXACTLY like ""We've Got A Live One Here"" on some tracks....but clearly, it is not. Probably recorded during the same tour. Who Knows. Great versions of Hot Rod Lincoln, and Cold Country Blues on this album. But it's pretty much a ""Crowd Pleaser"" set list, so it's a take it or leave it kinda deal...all & all not bad, four stars."
3,A little disappointing!,"The carry basket is very cute but the content was sparse! wooden knitting needles a little rough, needed some fine sandpapering! The yarn not easy for a beginner to handle, a little better quality would improve the product."
1,MISSING SEVERAL PARTS,"I could not give this as a present. It was missing the knitting needles, crochet hook and sewing needle. So I paid a lot of money for 6 very small balls of yarn. Very upsetting. Have to come up quick for a replacement gift."
3,Ok for the price,"It is a nice gift for a little girl. However, it would be best if you knew what you were doing first. The packaging says that you will be able to ake a hat, scarf, and handbag once you finish reading the instructions. I read them twice and thats not true. Aside from that everything else was fine."
1,How is a child supposed to learn?,"My granddaughter wanted to learn how to knit. So for Christmas I bought this kit. How is a child supposed to learn with needles without a point to pick up the stitches? and then the needles are so rough the yarn sticks to them and snags, most frustrating thing I have ever tried to do. Complete and utter waste of money!"
2,Way too hard!,"Unless you know how to knit already the directions in here are not good enough. It says this is for ages 8 and up and I bought it for my 8 year old but it was incredibly frustrating! Not a good gift, it's only good if someone already knows how to knit or crochet already."
3,Knitting Basket,I was disappointed that the latch fell of the first day. Given the price of the product this is unacceptable. The knitting basket was purchased for a 10 year old.
4,plenty for the money,"My daughter was pleased as punch. She got 900 feet (that's a lot for child sized mittens and scarves!) of yarn and a pretty basket to keep the things neat. The needles were just fine. A few other kits at our local shop were going for twice this and didn't have as much yarn and the ""baskets"" were cheap plastic tubs. If something is damaged I know we usually exchange the item to the store or call the manufacturer and they're more than happy to replace items. Also my daughter is seven years old and just entered 1st grade and she had no problems understanding the instructions with a little help from me."
3,What you get for your money.,"The basket is pretty, the the wooden needles were damaged, and we had to go to the library for better basic instructions for my daughter to understand."
2,Poor quality needles,I bought this for my 10 yr old grandchild who is learning to knit. The needles are horrible - very rough and unfinished. They snag the yarn. This alone is frustrating enough to discourage a child from continuing. A better set of needles would improve this greatly.
2,Tenchi Muyo,Lets start off by saying that this is an okay tape to buy. It starts by Tenchi freeing Ryoko from the cave. Then Later Ayeka arrives after being in a deep sleep. Chases Ryoko and Tenchi. She captures them and later they crash on earth. I am telling you though If you want uncut Tenchi don't buy this like I did. Half of the episodes are missing.1.Ryoko Ressurected2.Here Comes Ayeka3.Hello RyoOki
3,"Good, But....",Although the series is good. I recomend buying the actually set that is not missing any of the episode. Due to the cuts you lose some of the jokes that are involved and the actions that make the movies comedy up. Again I would have to recommend the uncut dvd set or the uncut vhs' of the series.
2,American Chopper - Season 4 - Part 2,"This set includes 3 disks with 2 shows per disk, total of 6 episodes. The episodes are:49. Caterpillar Bike 1 Original air date: 4/4/200550. Caterpillar Bike 2 Original air date: 4/11/200551. Gillette Bike 1 Original air date: 4/18/200552. Gillette Bike 2 Original air date: 4/25/200553. NAPA Drag Bike 1 Original air date: 6/6/200554. NAPA Drag Bike 2 Original air date: 6/13/2005This is a bare bones set. NO special features, not even a disk menu to choose episodes on each disk. Discovery did much better with seasons 1-3, these new sets leave much to be desired, and at $5+ per episode, the price is steep. Come on Learning Channel/Discovery- you can do better than this!!!!!"
1,American Choppers season 4,Part 1 and Part 2 of seaon four do not appear to be professional done DVDS - it looks like somethimg that was burned on a computer . Scratches on the DVD - No menus. It states it was produced by an AMAZON company not Discovery Channel I love American Chopper but this set is not worth the 29.95 -
2,"Cheap quality, Same good show, though!","The dvds are definitely manufactured by someone different than the first 3 seasons. The dvds are really bad in the fact that they are out of order on the disc (episode wise). I also had a disc arrive that did not even work. The best part is that the cheap producers did not use any anti-burning techniques, so you can burn / copy them all you want. Might save you some money if you don't want to pay the 30 bucks per set. I would ask around if I were you before buying.On a good note, the show is still excellent and provides lots of entertainment. I love American Choppers. I just hope they choose a better company next time to release the dvds, just for their sake, because pirating is going to be an issue with seasons 4-5-6 (which I bought)."
2,"Download 20 episodes, or get 24 episodes of Amazon instant video","I really enjoyed the comments of both parts of season 4 of American Chopper. I agree $5 per episode is expensive. You can download season 4 per episode for $1.99 from iTunes, a software program from Apple. There are 20 episodes of this season that you can download. You could also buy Amazon instant video season 4 of 24 episodes for $29.95 or $1.99 per episode. This will put it in your digital library that you can watch when you are on Amazon.con online only."
3,wheres the beef?,"has no extra features like some of the other seasons I've gotten. Almost has a pirated feel to the quality, or lack of. You insert the disc and it just starts automatically into the episodes, no menu or anything. Feels like I should have paid some guy $5.00 from he's car trunk for it."
3,Very poor compression,"I have every FIA season review available on DVD since 2000 (there's a jump over 2001, '02, then the series picks up again with '03)The great coverage and quantity of content presented in this '06 review is severely compromised by the horrible picture quality. If it was going to look this bad, they might as well have released it on VHS. When one compares this to the '04 DVD, for example, . . . there's simply no excuse.This really should've been released as a two disc set.BTW, there's a new company logo on this year's disc . . . which makes me wonder whether the FIA and FOM switched vendors and are as disappointed with the results as I am. I don't know who to blame, but only hope they put out a better product next year"
1,"If this is a bootleg version, then it's acceptable","In the past I purchased one of the Disney DVDs which had a very poor resolution. Once I sent it in for replacement, I was told that the copy I sent out was bootlegged. I must confess that the footage on this DVD is on par with the bootlegged version I purchased in the past.The video is highly compressed, so that any time video changes, the images are incredibly pixilated and it takes some time for frames to settle to show a crisp, static imagine. I am viewing this DVD on a standard CRT TV and it can not even be compared to the DirecTV broadcast I saw last year. I can only imagine how bad it will show it self on an HD screen.So, if you are interested in the Formula 1 and want to have a memorable 2006 season, I can only say that SRO Entertainment has given us a very poor version to enjoy."
4,Formula 1 at its best!,This is a must have for Formula 1 fans. It's a great wrap up to the season and includes a short tribute segment to retiring 7-time world champion Michael Schumacher.
5,Two Thumbs Up,This is a great DVD. Not wasting your time. Fully previewed. More than just two thumbs up.
3,Good replacement,I bought this remote to replace a remote for an RCA television that vanished. As a remote for the television I like it better than the original remote. As far as controlling my Sony DVD player and my Sony VCR it does not hold the programming longer than a day. I still have the remotes for those devices and prefer to use them but as a replacement for the lost TV remote it has performed better than expected.
1,Don't Buy This Remote!,"Unless you want to continue to have to re-program the stupid remote, this is a waste of money. At least 5 times a day I have to re-program the stupid thing and then it will shut on and off but never actually change the channel.I am super disappointed."
2,Shedding blade is more economical,"The furminator works just OK. It has very tiny teeth so you have to clean after every stroke. I found the straightness of the blade unforgiving to a horse's natural contours and it is surprisingly heavy. Your money is better spent on a 5-10 dollar round shedding blade, which I will order shortly. The packaging warns you about protecting the teeth and I suspect one drop on a concrete floor and it would all be over for this tool. This will probably sit on the shelf."
2,Furminator,"I have not found this product to work any better than any other deshedder on the market & think it is highly overpriced. Had I known it wasn't any better or that it wasn't the amazing shedder they claim it to be(over the others), I would never have considered this over priced de-shedder.Don't waste your money, it is not worth the price."
5,excellent product u will never need another dog brush!!!,excellent grooming tool!! removed 3 bags of hair from my hairy 150 lb dog!! we love it and since its so sturdy we will never need another dog brush. highly recommended product and seller...
5,great product,"I had never heard of this tool for the horses, so I thought I would try it and it is great!!!! I used it on my horses and they don't get fussy and move around, like they used to with the regular curry comb, this is much more gentle and they love the way it makes them feel. And of course getting the hair off is easier on them and on me."
4,Interesting!!!,"""Acupuncture in the treatment of Depression"" is interesting, because link east and western therapeutics."
2,One extra star for talent?,"I consider myself a huge progressive rock fan but I think this cd is awful. The vocalist can't sing and all the time signature changes make for a complicated mess. There definitely are some talented musicians on this cd and I think if they stuffed a sock in the vocalist's mouth, it might make an interesting jazz cd....but then I don't really like jazz. Anybody want to buy a slightly used cd?"
4,"Theater Arts, where School Boards don't go.",The image of the Little Red truck brought me back to my sand box when I was racing through sand roads bringing my product to town. It was a load of joy and surprises. This story was more formal than the whimsical title yet the story captured the life of the Tour Guide. Another view would be the story of the children when the Red Truck arrived. It was a dream come to reality and hopes that saw completion. This was an adult presentation about the dreams of a child. This dream to promote theater for children came across as the duty of the adult to compliment the failure of school boards. Where's the whimsical feeling of imaginary characters coming from the heart of a child? This is a good story for one who believes in the project already.
3,Feeling Duped,I am just upset this doesn't include remixes of the lead song of this cd-single. Generally that's the purpose of a cd-single. This includes 3 other songs which i'm not particularly impressed with.
5,Big Blue Library,"This is a must-have for any die hard Giants fan. With Eli, we may need a second issue but it's a valued part of my Giants library."
5,Go big blue!,Must have for any Giants fan. I loved it. Throw it on a few times a year. Never gets old.
5,A great purchase for any NYG fan,"For those who choose to remember Lawrence Taylor as the most dominant player of his time--and not, you know, a loser who allegedly pays underage girls to sleep with him--then buy this DVD."
4,Good Book for a beginner,"I recommend this book for anyone new to C++ or migrating from C to C++ (although it covers advanced topics as well like STL). I found it better than other books like ""Sams Teach yourself C++ in 21 days"". The book also has its own website and some stuff on that as well.It has worked out problems at the end of each chapter which illustrate whatever was taught in that particular chapter. I especially liked the lucid explanation about each topic with relevant examples."
1,Find another book. Not for a beginner.,This book doesn't flow at all. It is hard to follow along. I am a beginner and this book almost has turned me off from programming all together. I recommended looking for another book.
5,Highly recommend story for history enthusiasts ...,"July 16, 1999I first became aware of James Burke work through the Discovery/TLC channels and when I stumbled across his audio novel Connections I had to try it out. Connections was great and so I was encouraged to try out his other audio novels which were just as ingenious and entertaining.The quality of James Burke's work set the stage for what has become a new age in bedtime stories. My new born son then 3 months was quickly introduced to the art of the audio novel as his new bedtime stories.Its been well over a year now after several dozen audio novels the little guy has now turned 18 months old. The very creative story of The AxeMaker's Gift still gets a replay every few months and he enjoys it every time.The only sad part about the James Burke audio novels is that I haven't seen a new one in a very long time.I highly recommend this creative story about history and the connections which brought us to where we are!Arnold D Veness"
3,Great Beginnings...,"An important, timely & vital point is being made by these authors. I listened intently to their ideas, mostly while jogging. I loved the prehistoric stuff, but after that it all became pretty familiar. I agreed with their thoughts on controlling our technology instead of it controlling us, but there's not much we can do about it when, in so many ways, we *are* our technology. Still, it is good & inspiring & true. Everyone should read it. I just gave it three stars because in the middle sections my running pace slowed considerably, indicating non-involvement."
1,What a disappointment!,"First let me say I like James Burke. Currently I am watching his series ""The Day the Universe Changed"" It's excellent. The problem with this tape is his premise with evolution, It's only a theory, but Mr Burke goes on for the whole of side one about evolution as if it were fact. Then with side four it's nothing but doom & gloom. Mr Burke stick with history. Science & telling the future is not your foray."
3,A Book of Lust,"This is the first romance novel that I just could not get into. However, I forced myself to continue reading it to the end in hopes that it would get better. Although the ending had a little surprise, it was not enough the save the story at all. The characters were too troubled, and all the sex proves that the relationship was based on lust, not love...."
3,A disapointment in an otherwise great series,"The Chung Kuo series to this point has been a wonderfullyintertwined set of characters and situations. The characters DavidWingrove has developed are complex and realistic. The world they inhabit is strange, intriguing, and strangely familar at the same time. With this novel it seems he runs out of steam. He builds conflicts wonderfully and develops the struggles between the opposing forces, and then flies in a solution (or new conflict depending on how you look at it) that dashes everything he built up. The new plot twists feel unsatisfactory simply because there is no basis for them. His characters have interesting quirks or personality flaws that he introduces and then seems to drop. I'll get the next book in the series on the basis of the previous five and the hope that he can recapture the magic that was in those books for me."
5,Great product,"Works as designed. Nice and flexible, easy to snake through tires. I use it to lock down 8 scooters and it works fine. Don't forget you still need a lock, this is just a cable."
2,Blood and Black Lace disc won't play on some players,"WARNING! The Blood and Black Lace disc has a known problem with not being able to play in a Philips/Magnavox 825 and various Pioneer players including: DV-414, DV-515, and DVL-909."
3,Not For Dummies,"Apple iMac Desktop with 20"" Display MA876LL/A (2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 1 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive, SuperDrive)The book started well enough but as it went on it became a book for people more advanced than me. Alot of things were not covered to the extent that it didn't lead anywhere. also did not have a glossary of terms, and that left me blind to what I was reading. Anyway I use as a go to when I get lost.Sincerely Al"
2,Rather dry and hard to follow.,"I have fancied all my ""For Dummies"" series books with the exception of this one. The author doesn't present the material in reference fashion. One cannot page quickly to the section to troubleshoot problems. When you actually finally page to the specific section, the information is not easy to decipher. I cannot recommend this text."
3,A dummy's review,"This title is very misleading, causing me to buy the wrong book. This book is about the snow leopard operating system. New iMacs run on Lion, slightly different. If you have snow leopard, good book"
2,Very useful but not perfect,"When things do not go according to its instructions it can leave you with nowhere else to go, as when I connected the FireWire, according to its instructions, and the 'continue' button remained grey leaving me at a loss. Still, as I said, very useful."
2,Author needs to spend more time explaining how and not just what imacs can do,Book is not easy to follow and I agree with another reviewer that the book spends more time telling you about things the mac can do and less about explaining how to do them.
1,What a Waste of Time,"Yes I previewed the book 's subjects and it appeared to cover what I wanted. But when I received it, I found any relation between the text and what I was needing totally missing.It does not have enough illustrations and an introduction to the various applications of the keys and combinations. More point summaries would have been useful.Moshi Mini DisplayPort Cable for MacBooks and iMac - White (99MO041101)"
4,iMac for Dummies,Very helpful in making the transition from PC to iMac. You can read cover to cover or pick out just your issues of the day.
5,I can't wait to read the rest of the book,"I met the author in a coffee shop today. In the course of a wide-ranging conversation, he mentioned his book. After reading a chapter on his website, I knew I would have to order the book to satisfy my curiosity. When I think that he is the same age as my oldest daughter, I can't believe all that he has accomplished already. I also can't imagine the pain his family endured having to be separated from him at such a young age."
4,great band,"Somehow I missed this band but then recently found them on Pandora internet radio. There's a 'Jam' influence for sure, but the band stands on its own just fine. Their albums are well-produced, which helps quite a bit. I am picky about music but I actually like all of their CD's. The worst thing I can say is that the lyrics arent always the deepest and a few of the tracks should really be B-sides. There is however some great guitar work and the singer has a great ""rock band"" voice that works well with the tunes. If you like Artic Monkeys you might want to give this band a listen."
4,"Discover this one, Britpop fans!","I can't believe this poppy, upbeat CD doesn't have a huge amount of buzz -- it's one of my four favorites of the year. Just to give an idea: My others are the ""Razorlight"" CD, Gomez' ""How We Operate"" and the Arctic Monkeys' ""Whatever People Say About Me."" This one's sorta in between those, stylistically -- guitar-based pop, with great drums, and a smidge more production than the other three. The lead singer sounds a bit like Billy Bragg (though the songs do not) and the sound is a bit reminiscent of Housemartins. Anyway, try it. It's worth the price of an import."
