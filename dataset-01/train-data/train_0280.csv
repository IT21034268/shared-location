2,I'll probably end up throwing mine away,"Listen to the people who say that Belkin seems to have changed the way they make these. I have a silver Belkin WaveRest pad that's about 10 years old and it's my favorite mousepad. I bought a black one in 2012, and the wrist rest is a little firmer than the old one, and the pad itself is a terrible mousing surface. My optical mouse will not track consistently. The pointer often gets stuck in one spot, and I have to pick the mouse up and set it back down to get it moving again. The black pad I bought this year was less than $7, so I was willing to gamble. I may try to get another silver one before I decide to give up on this brand."
4,Does What It's Suppose To,First off package came 2 days early which is a good thing. I like it and it works which is all that matters. Only thing I wish is that softer on the wrist. I don't have wrist problems I just got tired of my wrist scraping against my wooden desk. If you do have wrist problems see if you can find something softer.
1,mouse gel pad wrist rest,"Did not work with my mouse. wrist rest is great but, have to keep another mouse pad over it."
3,The edge of the pad may irritate your wrist,"The actual gel on the pad is great however, the edge on the wrist is a little sharp and it irritates me sometimes. This will be perfect if it had smooth edges."
2,NOT the same as before,"I'm still using a similar Belkin mousepad from around 2005 that is the best mousepad ever made.Sadly, Belkin has switched to a cheaper supplier.The quantity and feel of the Gel in the wrist pad is much reduced so the pad is stiff.The old gel pad was soft and supple. While its not a ""brick"" as some have said, its definitely not the gel I'm used to.Still a decent mousepad, but not nearly as good before. Hopefully it may break in a bit over time, but I doubt it.Why do companies do this crap?You make $0.10 more profit/unit but you lose your customer loyalty.DUMB."
2,Much Too Hard !!! Save your money.,"Sincerely, I've read a number of comments saying this thing is too hard, and as it is not too expensive, I thought I might give it a try. It is definitely much too hard (is it realy gel inside ? It feels more like dense foam or rubber ...)I don't think I will get used to it as the thing is supposed to take the shape of the wrist and not the opposit. In fact, even after half an hour of use, my right wrist is already slowly getting uncomfortable warm and it seems also that the stiffness of that thing increases the friction on the synthetic surface. So I'm already looking for another real wrist rest..."
1,useless,"When I put the Mouse above the Mouse pad, the Mouse cannot work smoothly. I tried several Mouses, the result is the same. It wastes my money."
3,"Fuming...the pad that is, and did not work with one of my laser mice","Comfortable. However, fuming with fumes out of the box. I had to leave it out for the day (in the shade...) and in the laundry room for the night so the fumes could go away. Seems ok now. One major problem though, I have a laser mouse (not a rollerball) that needs a reflective surface in order to work. The pad is a matte black...so it wouldn't work with my mouse. I tried another mouse and it worked with that one, also a laser mouse. I replaced all batteries and tried the first laser mouse and that did not work. It would work on any other surface, but not this pad. Both of my mice are about 5 years old so maybe newer models work fine. So to summarize, it may not work with your laser mouse, you'll have to air it out for a day or two, but it's very comfortable."
2,Not a great buy,"Sure, this purchase didn't break the bank but I definitely wouldn't buy it again. The pad made my mouse slip and I couldn't really move it around at all. So, I just cut the pad off and use the wrist rest. The wrist rest is quite comfortable."
5,2nd,"I had one of these before, and it was amazingly comfortable...until I lost it. Buying a new one! Highly recommended if you tend to get sore wrists while working/using your computer for long periods of time."
1,"Chalk up another ""I got a junker.""","Since there seem to be some reviewers who are happy with their mouse pads and others who got junky ones that are nothing like earlier models, thought I'd chime in: I got a junky one. Used the older version happily for years, and these are lightweight, and worse, stiff under your wrist. However, I don't notice a particular smell unless I stick my nose right up to it. So, I dunno if they're being made by different manufacturers, but junky ones are definitely in circulation as of November 2011.I'm glad I didn't toss my old one out - even worn out and dirty, it's better than the new one. Next time, I'll look for a different brand."
4,Comfortable Pad but It Smells!,"I bought an identical pad 6 years ago and have enjoyed the comfort it affords my wrist. I'm still using it -- nothing wrong with it! After buying a new computer I decided to buy another one of the Belkin WaveRest pads. It looks and feels exactly like the older one but upon removing it from the packaging, the room suddenly smelled like a warehouse full of tires! I've been airing it out for several days now and the smell isn't quite as strong, but I haven't started using it yet. I suspect the odor is a result of it being manufactured in China, but that's only a guess. Except for the strong smell, this is a 5-star item."
1,Cheap,Very cheap mouse pad. I would recommend trying something different. Mine started to break after only a few months and it wasnt as comfortable as my old one.
4,Wanted for Use With LogiTech Trackman Mouse,"I bought this mouse pad to support my wrist with my Logitech trackman mouse. I love those trackball mice. Anyway, I just thought it would be more comfortable with my wrist supported, so I bought this mouse pad. It is comfortable. I only took one star off because at work I have one with a memory foam rest. It is better than these."
5,Love It !,Received the pad today and love it ! Its really comfortable and forms around my wrist. I love it ! Great traction as well.
2,Strong rubber odor,"This mouse pad is functional, but the strong rubber odor rubs off on wrist and is not pleasant for my working environment. . .almost toxic."
4,Great mouse pad for the price,Comfortable and provides support for an extended period of time. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,You must get one!,"I used to suffer of several wrist pain, since my job requires many hours using the computer, but since I got this product the pain has gone.I definitely recomend it!"
1,The material is terrible,The material is not good for a mouse pad. My mouse makes a noise when moving on it and it reduces the sensitivity greatly. I am returning it.
3,Gel isn't as Firm as I thought it would be,"After about a week of laying my wrist on it, the gel pad caved in. I'm not sure if that was it's purpose, but I was looking for more of a rubbery firm wrist guard. It's not a bad product for the price so I really can't complain."
2,Not so great.,"The mousepad feels really good and seems nice enough, but the only issue is that my optical mouse doesn't work on it. It's a nice logitech bluetooth mouse that works everywhere else, but as other reviews have mentioned an optical mouse doesn't necessarily work with this mousepad. Be caution before you buy one."
2,New one is too firm for me,"I have used Belkin gel mouse pads for many years and agree with the reviewers who commented that the latest product feels different. I have owned about 10 of these. The old ones have a white ""Belkin"" inside a white ellipse at the top while the new one has a silver ""Belkin"" with no ellipse.The old ones were softer under the wrist, which was better for me. The new one is much firmer, which is both less comfortable for my wrist and makes my hand uncomfortable because it is higher above my mouse.I won't be using the new one because it is just too uncomfortable, and I will be looking for a new brand of mouse pad to try."
5,Excellent mouse pad,The wrist rest is perfectly comfortable and lasts much longer than memory foam. I like the fact that this is all one piece and it's not heavy so I can throw it in my laptop bag.
1,Just purchased this -- NOT WORTH IT,"So, I just bought this laptop mouse pad for school because I left my razer mousepad at home. This mousepad is awful, it's made of cheap materials, the rest feels stiff and uncomfortable, and optical mouses have a horrible time tracking across the cheap surface."
3,Its a mouse pad,"I needed a mouse pad and this was the cheapest yet durable pad i could find on here. I like it. It does what it's intended to do, what more do you want?"
1,Get this thing out of here,"This LOOKS like the original Belkin WaveRest (which cost $8). Looks only. The material is different. Not as fine or nice. The pad? Not as soft and gel like. Too lame. And what's with the bar under the pad? Why is that there? I can feel it under the pad. It's annoying.I still have an original WaveRest from a decade ago. I'm using it right now. The way to identify an original is that it will have ""Beklin"" in which at the top with a white oval around it... just like the product image above; however, that is NOT what you receive. You receive a cheaper, inferior version sans oval.Sorry, my friends. I am still looking for a replacement (or original) WaveRest. Out there somewhere there is one for sale, and I'm going to buy it. I'll let you all know if I find it."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I have used mouse pads with built in gel pads before and found them to be very comfortable.So I was surprised that after some light use I was already feeling discomfort in my wrist, which was a surprise as the whole point of the gel pad is to support the wrist and reduce wrist strain. I decided that well maybe it was just me and went about my business not wanting to admit to my wife that I bought a boat anchor. To my surprise several days later she also complained of the same issue, so we turned it sideways and now use it without the gel support. I went back and checked my son's mouse pad with gel support and found his to be slightly softer and allow more compliance, and made this one seem very stiff in comparison.In summary the mouse pad itself has a good surface and works very well with a Logitech High Performance Optical mouse, just didn't like the gel wrist support, so probably not worth the cost."
1,Gel? Doesn't feel like it.,"Compared to my last gel mouse pad, this feels like a rock. My wrist has been hurting after a week of use. Then entire mouse surface is cloth (lycra?) as well, which isn't necessary with most laser/led mice being produced these days. It's just going to trap dirt like crazy."
1,Not for Optical Mouse (Is there any other kind today?),"My Logitech Cordless Optical mouse works better on the table surface than on this mouse pad. In fact it works better on almost any surface, including my sofa. A waste of money for an optical mouse."
3,Basic and shallow,"I had hoped for an in-depth discussion of HR pitfalls and remedies. Instead I got a VERY basic course in hiring, firing, evaluation and such. Maybe if you have never been a manager, this might help you. But if you have any experience at all, don't bother."
3,"Poor organization, Elementary, yet a useful reference for...","This is a good source of information for both professionals and new students of HR management. Content:The author has done a descent job collecting useful informations and also adressing a number of key issues in the field of HR management.Non-the-less he often fails to provide an in-depth analysis that the discipline deserves.Indeed, imprtant topics such as,HR Forcasting on P.65,is dealt with as if it is a legal briefing than an in-depth analysis that such crucial subject requires.Organization:Perhaps, the weakest part of this book is its poor organization; It lacks cohesiveness.In fact, it is organized so poorly that the reader notices almost instantly. Conclusion: It could be a solid book if re-orgonized/revised, added more in-depth analysis,and avoid unnecessary repeatitions that appper and re-appear throughout the book.Still, a good source for new students and new employees of the HR management."
2,Useless,"Do not read this book unless you have never even heard of the Human Resources profession. The book covered such basic concepts that anyone with a little common sense could have figured out on their own. I wanted to learn more about the laws that govern H.R., recruiting and sucession planning. There was a simple introduction to a few of the laws that affect H.R. policies, but nothing in depth. The section on recruiting was extremely basic and succesion planning was not even mentioned. I have only been in the H.R. business for one year and this book didn't cover anything I didn't alreaady know."
4,"Remarkable book, remarkable man","Naturalist at large, by Thomas Barbour, dates from 1943. The author himself died in 1946, but he still speaks to us throught this record of his travels as a naturalist throughout the world. Luckily, this work, now out of copyright, can be preserved digitally or as a reprint. Barbour's work in Panama and Cuba was especially interesting to me, but all his chapters are insightful and, well, timeless. Enjoy."
1,Worthless,"The book takes no stand on anything. Just ""you may prefer to do this"" and ""some people prefer to do that."" And it's very badly written."
1,Che Guevara Speaks: Selected Speeches and Writings,"Anyone who has believed the myth of Che Guevara should read not only this book, but also the denunciation of his victims.These speeches are mere propaganda a-la Stalin and Fidel Castro.His victims, those who survived this man's criminal career, speak from their hearts and not from the powerful position that people like Che Guevara used to oppressed the Cuban people,These faked prophets denied the Cuban people the freedom they professed were bringing!Che Guevara today is no more that a sad caricature of what once was a powerful Orwellian propaganda machine.The truth about this man will show up. Many were duped. Many wanted to believe this man. He died the same way he treated hundreds of Cubans in the firing squad under his direct orders."
3,Rendition,I have poor eyesight so found this film hard to see. Apart from that the content is disturbing and it needs to be seen. The documentary on the same disc was incredible and I still can't get it out of my head.
4,Thought provoking,"Though this political thriller makes its sympathies clear from the outset, it raises numerous issues that will make you think about the policies a democracy should condone in the name of fighting terror. It's not as black and white as it may seem to either side in the torture debate. The script here is intelligent, the acting very fine and much of the dialogue is in subtitles, lending some authenticity, even if the trick is becoming more and more of a film cliche. This is a very taut drama. Watch it."
3,National Security and torture,"Basically a movie criticising American policy of kidnapping ethnic and other individuals suspected of terrorist or anti-American activities. Roles are pretty generic: young generations are pure and idealistic, while the older generations are jackals corrupted or cynical, willing to do whatever it takes in their zealous effort to protect US and its inhabitants. Meryl Streep gives stellar performance as an icy US senator who will not stop at anything, while Reese Witherspoon gives her poorest performing effort I have ever seen on the big screen. This political thriller attempts to mix politics, cultural differentes, anti-american feelings from the islamic societies and brain washing of young men in underdeveloped countries who choose to become martyrs out of their own feelings of hopelessness, lonelines and despair."
4,Compelling,"I liked this movie. I don't think it got the recognition that it should have. This film is important for two reasons: one, it explains to people what really happens in terrorist groups, and two, it explains the government point of view. This is one of the most compelling stories I've ever watched on film. However, it is a little long, and some parts could have been kept out of it. But overall, a very moving screenplay, especially in today's world."
5,Devastating,"It's a great shame that this movie did not get the audience it deserved. Every American should watch it. Yes, it's a movie, so yes, it's melodramatic. And yes, dear Bushies, some of these practices started before 9/11, but certainly George W has taken it to the limits. This is a beautiful, thoughtful, provocative film -- watch it! Then think about where we are going as Americans."
1,Verdict rendered ... BORING!,"I was eagerly waiting to view this film. I understand all too well the horrors of relatives and friends gone missing with no explanation. This is planned and routine in all of the world ... not just in the nefarious offices and dark air hangers of the CIA! Having said that, this movie was disappointing especially given the excellent cast. It lacked substance and was full of stereo types, both left and right, us and foreign. What a let down."
2,Way too political!!!,"Why can't I watch a movie and not be inundated with the views of others? This movie laid its cards down since the word action. Its whole intent was to object to the actions of the government in the post 9/11 world. It had some promise but it stayed true to its message and made a villain out of everyone but a victim that was manufactured by writers. I want the politics to end. If it is going to take a Democrat in office then get it over with. I want my movies, TV, and other forms of entertainment back from the overwhelming support of those with money in Hollywood. If they agree with something they sure want to make sure everyone on this continent agrees. I am not saying I disagree, but c'mon! Please make a good movie or show for once. I am tired of this!!!! Why must we continue to battle each other!!! We are all Americans!!!!!!!!"
3,"Great Acting, Average Storyline","Watched this movie a few nights ago. Good acting on all counts by actors with so-so storyline. A man is suspected of terrorism and kidnapped to foreign soil to be held in a prisoner in a jail while they torture him in order to get a confession...In the meantime, the prisoner's wife, an American citizen, is worried sick about the disappearance of her husband and goes about trying to find out why he never made it home from a business trip overseas.Once her husband returns home, things are the same. He has witnesses brutality and trauma that an ordinary person never encounters and she wonders if he was ever involved in terrorism or not. How life changes on a dime that changes the way one sees things forever."
3,"Watchable, But Lacks Punch","Timely movie that questions whether it's right/just to torture terror suspects. But it's very one sided. Should have made it a little more balanced. Also, the story line is a little too unbelievable."
2,Bloodless,"""Rendition,"" though boasting a stellar cast of great actors (Jake Gyllenhaal, Meryl Streep, and Reese Witherspoon) only fitfully attains anything approaching human and thoughtful: Reese Witherspoon going off on Meryl Streep about her Egyptian born husband who Streep has sent off and out of the United States to be interrogated for alleged terrorist activity.The rest of this film lumbers along, stopping only to witness grotesque scenes of torture and massacre.The problem here is that director Gavin Hood (of ""Crash"" infamy) does not make enough of a commitment to his material for us to care about what he is presenting. The entire film feels like it is shot behind a scrim which keeps us at arms length emotionally and morally. We watch but we don't care."
1,Terrible!,Pitiful left-wing Hollywood propaganda film that ignores the harsh reality of the ongoing terrorist jihad against the West and especially against the United States.
1,Not vintage Meryl Streep,"I am always interested in Meryl Streep. Her name was listed in a way suggesting she was a principal player. She is not.This DVD will give you about 10 minutes of a character type that does not allow Streep to display her range of acting talent.There are many other reviews which address the question of the use of interogation techniques in fighting terrorists and I don't wish to add another. This is not a ""war"" movie which will bring the country together."
1,good music terrible story,"So, first of all, the story is told in a warped time sense that doesn't work until the very end. Second, so now the suicide bombers are the sympathetic characters? I don't think so. I totally hated this movie. I'm so sick of hollywood scratching the bottom of the barrel for things they can blame on America."
1,Typical mindless liberal nonsense.,"Typical left wing ""Hate America first"" moive.It is all our fault terrorists hate us.There were not terrorists before Bush etc...Save you money and get the same BS from the kook liberal blogs."
1,Antiwar Tripe,"My other review was recently removed, probably because someone whined about the fact that I used the words ""girlyboys"" and ""Hollywood"" in the same sentence. Everyone should know Hollywood is made up of ex-Green Berets who never tire of making patriotic movies to promote the greatness of America. Anyway, this movie is just more of the usual sophomoric drool used to feed the antiwar, blame-America-first crowd. Instead of watching this movie why not do something more practical, like waiting by your mailbox for the winning lottery ticket to accidentally be delivered. Only if this actually occurs will I recommend buying the movie."
1,STUPID,The makers of this film would rather see further terrorist attacks on the United States than do whatever is necessary to interrogate TERRORISTS!Terrorists who have been taken from the BATTLEFIELD. Just plain stupid. (too bad we can't vote negative stars)
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This is the story of the aftermath of a terrorist bombing. Rendition shows what happens behind the scenes of tragedy from six different sides and it's a pretty compelling story. I love how unique and eye opening this film is, however they really dumb it down for you. This should be the kind of movie that makes you think, but instead they kind of explain everything in detail to you from beginning to end. The film was very realistic and clear, that is until the ending. They took this intense, believable, behind the scenes film, and gave it an impossible ending which honestly wound up ruining the whole thing for me."
5,When homeland security is abused,"""Rendition"" is a fictional drama film which draws attention to the ability of governments to refer terrorist suspects to offshore interrogation.The narrative is cleverly put together to also include a subplot and as the story unfolds it becomes clear how the two stories link.It is seeing the inhuman treatment of Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), who is detained in an unnamed North African country, and the anxiety that his whereabouts cause his wife Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon) and family, which exposes the lawlessness that can be used against terrorist suspects.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
4,Interesteing,This book was fun but a little far fetched at times. I would read further into the mystery to see what happens next.
3,dying to get published,"just not top notch story line or expression could have held more interest, just a little on the dull side"
2,Dying to get published,A good idea ruined by the unbelievable antics of the main character. The author has obviously never worked in an office.
4,Dying to Get Published,"A zany, fun, action-filled fiction novel that is perfect for an entertaining read. A good book to escape from the real world demands of reality. The author has the knaxk for a grea plot - with believable characters."
3,nicely done,Really enjoyed this book. The female lead was well done. Just enough hope to want to believe and enough sarcasm to question what was going on. If you like mystery rhat is not too hard core you will enjoy this book.
4,"A fast, fun read","Dying to get Published is not a heavy duty mystery it is light hearted and takes a poke at the mystery genre (Jennifer is a pre-published mystery writer who creates wacky heroines and plots that are woven throughout the book). Judy Fitzwater has accurately described every hopeful writer's feelings in Dying to Get Published.I could totally relate to Jennifer Marsh, the main character, and her wacky cast of friends. She is devoted to her writing and does catering parties to help make ends meet - it is at a party she and her friend Dee Dee are working where she meets Sam, a great dream guy and picks up her first ""case"".As I said, the plot intricacies might leave a bit to be desired for those looking for a hard core mystery but for me this was a fun read. I like Jennifer, her wonderful dog Muffy and her unborn (and unconceived ) child Jaimie (could be a girl or a boy).As whole - this was a great premise and a fun book."
3,Dying to Get Published,"I enjoyed the book and would recommend it for light reading. Not heavy hitting mystery but it wasn't boring either. Since I have retired, I read a lot and like hard hitting mystery but also like light reading also."
4,Dying to get published,"The book started a little slow but as I dug deeper it became interesting. Overall, it's a good book and funny at times. I was surprised by the ending. I'll be reading her books in the future."
2,"Cute, but lightweight","This book has its moments and is sometimes amusing, but the writing quality is disappointing, and there are an irritating number of usage and spelling errors."
4,Funny and Original,"Although it begins shakily, by the end I really enjoyed the story. The characters are fun. The plot seems predictable at first, but it has a nice little twist you won't see coming."
2,It was okay,"I picked up ths book because I heard they were supposed to be like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series (the greatest series in the world). I was disappointed. This book was no where near as funny or interesting as Ms. Evanovich's. I had to struggle to finish it. While it was a good attempt, I thought it just wasn't interesting enough and the characters weren't fully developed. And as some reviewers have stated, the constant mentioning of Jaimie was not funny. I guess if you're bored with no other new books to read, this is an okay book to read, but don't start reading it with too many high expectations because you'll be disappointed."
5,This was such fun to read,"I wasn't sure just what I was expecting when I got this one. After the first few pages I didn't care what I thought I might be expecting, it was just fantastic. Pulled me right in and kept me there till the complete end. Loved the ending, I mean, no where in the whole story did that character come to mind as the culprit. Wow! Loved Sam as Jennifer's ""partner"". I can easily see them teaming up again and hope they do. I can easily read this story again and enjoy it just as much. Excellent read."
3,Cute,"A little clunky in places, but not a bad read for fun. Quick and easy to get through. Not great, but funny enough."
3,It's okay,"Wanted the details to move smoother. I think the character's were neat, but would have liked them to flow better."
4,Living to get published is more to the point.,This is a clever premise. Perhaps it would be best (if you are a writer) to avoid going throught the motions of setting up a murder. This author's setup for a book backfires!
4,Enjoyable,"The character, Jennifer Marsh, is very likable. I can't wait to read the next book in this series. Highly recommend"
2,Seems to ramble,"This book had a somewhat surprising ending but it took forever to get there. In my opinion, it was not worth the read."
4,Favorite,I chose this book and it was wonderful now a favorite ages 13and up a good and wonderful book I won't forget
4,sc,Was a pleasant surprised read. Would definitely read other books by this author. Had some humor in it that is a must for me.
3,good,"A good fill in reader when i'm stuck somewhere, i'm not finished with it yet. I have it on my phone a big plus."
2,Not what I expected!,"When I ordered Dying to Get Published by Jennifer Marsh, I only ordered what I thought was a Christian Fiction novel and I was quickly put off by the use of profanity. As a Minister I have a standard that I live by."
2,Just couldn't get in to it,"It is very rare that I can't make myself continue reading a book, hoping to get to some part that really interests me. This is one of those rarities. I forced myself to read all I could stand but I just had to give up. Just not interesting at all. I gave it 2 stars because that means ""don't like it"" and 1 star is ""I hate it"". I really didn't hate it, just couldn't find anything to like about it."
3,Slow start Fast finish,"The first half of the book is slow in reaching a point where the plot starts to make sense. I find the main characters obsession with her unconceived fetus distracting, tasteless and unnesessary. The portion of the book where it is tied into the story (ackwardly) could have been reworked so that the amusing qualities wouldn't seem quite so forced. HOWEVER, the last half of the book almost makes up for the stilted beginning. The murderer came as an almost complete surprise (I guessed though, the clues were a little obvious). I will read the follow-up books just to watch the characters develop."
2,Boring,I found it to be not very interesting. I only read 3 chapters then deleted it.It simply didn't appeal to me.
3,Its OK!,I really didn't enjoy this book. It was very scattered around to me. I also don't like how it was filed under Christian Author's with the lanugage it had. It was a very slow read. Found it very hard to want to read.
1,Dying To Get Published,I found the book boring and skimmed paragraph after paragraph hoping to reach a point that held my interest. Finally gave up.
2,An OK Summer Read,"The series is cute, but the attempts at humor aren't overly funny and the constant references to ""Jaimie"", the main character's unconceived fetus, stopped being funny after the first five times, to the point of distraction from the story."
3,Good plot,"Slow read I don't mind giving a review but why do I have to meet minimum word requirements, probably would have a lot better response on reviews feedback if Amazon didn't decide how much you need or have to say about a product."
2,It was a so-so read,The story line was so predictable that I felt I had read it before. Didn't finish the whole thing. Can't really recommend it to anyone.
3,Dying to get published,"It was not the best written, nor the worst written novel. But was a rather predicable story. Hopefully the next novels are better."
3,Too sticky,"This cream has a texture of a heavy hand cream. It provides a good barrier for moisture, but it is very hard to spread on the delicate facial skin. Beacause of that, it is not a good base for make up. Not the best of Clinique. I am glad it came in a small, less expensive than full -size package."
5,Great Service,I love the fusion razor blades I have purchased this item before and the service it terriffic. The product has always arrived on time.
1,Do Not Buy These Carttridges,These cartridges were extremely dull and felt like they were going to rip my face off when I used them. Do not buy from HJP.
1,"Good deal on defective blades, good money for junk","Blades were all dull and made loud vibrating noise when the razor was turned on. These are either defective blades intercepted on the way to the dumpster or fakes. Either way, they are useless junk. Went and bought another box at the local pharmacy for their inflated price. They worked night and day better than the blades I bought from these guys. Thanks a lot jerks."
1,Defective Razors,"Both packs of razors were open along the back seal, from corner to an opposite corner, allowing the razors to be slid out of one half of the back of the plastic box. I replaced a razor that I have used for over six weeks with one of the new ones. The new razor practically pulled all the hairs out of my face it was so dull. I tried two more from different cartridge packs and boxes. Same thing. I put my six week old razor back on my handle and it felt as smooth as can be against my face. I have used Fusion razors since they have come out and they are wonderful but trying to shave with these specific razors (first time purchasing them online)was painful and intolerable. I am asking for my money back."
3,Fusion cartriges,The text says 16 cartriges but the picture shows 8. I thought the price is for 16 cartridges but it ended up being only for 8. It is impossible to know whether the price is for 16 or 8 cartridges.
4,As good as Lone Rhino!,"So,This is as good (in my opinion) as the Lone Rhino CD...I originally purchased this album for the cover tune I'm down, but came to love every track.A must have"
1,Loud and Annoying,For such a little fan it sure makes a ton of noise. The power is inconsistent and will start blowing harder and then softer for no reason. It rattles like a car engine. I would not recommend it for anyone. I think it was a waste of money. If I still had the box I would return it.
2,Powerful but LOUD,"This small fan is quite powerful but extremely loud. As far as moving air, it's great. But, it's sound is distracting even on the lowest of four speeds and on high it dominates the room. Also, the remote should include the oscillate function. Had I been aware of the loudness of the unit I would have looked for a quieter fan."
1,DEFECTIVE AFTER TWO DAYS,"I purchased this fan for my mothers room at the nursing home, but after two days the fan started making noise and would only work at low speed. Nursing room personnel told me I could not leave this fan there for possible electrical hazard."
2,Fantastic,"Don't buy this fan, unless you can put up with noise it will make on high speed. Also, if it has green lights(like my blizzard fan did), it will light up a dark room at night. Also, you will see the fan shadow on your ceiling. Low speed is quiet enough for sleeping, but high will disturb you. The angle tilt adjustments are not precise, and are difficult to do. There are better choices."
5,This fan is GREAT!!!,The blizzard is really great for anyone looking for relief on a hot summer day. I especially enjoy the convienence of the remote control.
4,Good basic fan,"This is the second fan of this type I have bought. I've had my other for a couple of years now. Very reliable. The only negative I would say is that at the higher speeds, it's a bit loud. Don't know if this is the case with most fans - it may be. Otherwise, I love the tilt control and choice of stationary or oscillating. I really love the remote. Great for when you're in bed."
1,Worst Purchase of all,"I ORDERED THIS FAN 3 YEARS AGO FROM AMAZON. I LOVED IT SO WHEN IT BROKE I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE. THIS TIME IT WAS SOLD BY POLSTEINS HOME & BEYOND. WHAT I RECEIVED WAS A USED BROKEN FAN AND NOT THE ONE I ORDERED. IT WAS JUST THROWN IN THE BOX LIKE A PIECE OF GARBAGE. AFTER SEVERAL PHONE CALLS TO HOME AND BEYOND, THEY FINALLY SENT ME A RETURN LABEL AND I WAS REFUNDED THE FULL AMOUNT. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THAT COMPANY AGAIN. I ORDERED THE FAN DIRECTLY FROM HOLMES, WHICH ARRIVED BRAND NEW IN THE BOX, WHICH IS WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE. I AM SURPRISED THAT AMAZON DOESN'T CHECK OUT THE COMPANIES THAT THEY ARE REPRESENTING MORE CAREFULLY."
1,Has it's value but make sure you know what youre buying.,"Wish I looked inside this book before buying it. This book is just a giant unorganized list of chord progressions. I'm sure it's a valuable tool to someone but certainly not to me. I think the book ""Chord Progressions For Songwriters (Paperback)"" would be a better choice. I am a bit weary now of ordering a second book from this author.It is sloppy, poorly structured and quite frankly a waste of paper. The text in this book is in need of cosmetic surgery. Wish I spent my money on something else instead of contributing it to the negative impact this 450 pages must have had on the environment.Blasphemous."
1,A big dissapointment!!,This book is more about listing pages and pages of title songs and the years they were published than anything else. I believe you can get more instructive info on chord progressions from other books.
2,Flimsy,"Kind of cute, but flimsy flaps. Nice book for toddlers who are learning animals and sounds, and songs like Old Mac Donald."
3,It's only Ok,"I got this book thinking it'd be...well..better. The flaps are very small and hard to open, and some ripped the first time. Then, it's just a simple type that says ""a pig"" in basic font underneath that your thumb hides if you're not careful when you lift up the flap. My son likes the size of it because it's much smaller and chunkier (easier to throw too!) than the other books, but he's not that interested in the flaps or the story on the inside."
5,Not just another animal book,"This book is a favorite with my 21 month old. We got it when she was 18 months old when she already had many animal books. But she always goes back to this one. It has great illustrations and is sturdy, flaps aren't easily wrecked. She shakes her finger at the goat biting on the sock (""no, no bite""). We now 'knock' on the doors before we open them, so it is new all over again to her. She is speech delayed to it is great hearing her try to say 'cockadoodledoo'."
4,"fun, but very tiny book","bought for our 17 month old son, he loves some of the pages, but very tiny book"
3,It is a very small book,I like this book but it is really small. I was hoping for a good bedtime book but this one has ended up in the car for independent reading. The kids have a hard time with the flaps because they are really small. There are better lift the flap books with farm animals out there.
4,gift for my niece,Book was received in good condition and in a timely fashion. It was a Christmas gift and she seems to enjoy it.
4,Cute Book,My son really likes this book because of the flaps. It is a lot smaller than I originally thought it was but a perfect size for my son to carry around
4,very good book,good am like we read togeter he love to read this book good book for kid good very good book
2,Damaged,"The cover of this book was damaged, bent and scuffed up on the corner. I was disappointed but did not return as it was a christmas gift."
1,Tiny book,"I ordered this thinking my little girl would absolutely love it. She does, but the book is about 3 inches by 3 inches. Tiny book."
2,TINY book!!,"I bought this book just to get my purchase to qualify for free shipping. I was thinking it was going to be about the size of a standard book. This thing is TINY! It's only about 3"". My kids do like it but its just so small."
2,"Great read, bad construction.","Two qualms about book. the edges wear out easily. My 7 month old used it as a teether and within minutes the edges were white! not a book to be ""passed on"" 2nd qualm. They list the baby horse who is saying ""neigh, neigh"" as ""A PONY"" instead of ""A FOAL or FILLY"" for us horse lovers out there, there is no greater upset then having a child call a baby horse pony!"
1,Cute Chunky Book,**** I meant to give this book 4 stars. Perfect for your diaper bag and for those times when your infant/toddler is whiny...the open the door flaps will keep them occupied for a little while. Good value too!
2,The book is ok,"I was expecting it to be a bit more, and the parts of the book that open up were easily torn out by my daughter."
5,My kids love it,"beautiful fun and captivating drawings. If you need to calm you kids down or distract them from their tantrums, this is it!"
3,Cute Book,"The book was cute, but smaller than I expected. It literally fits in the palm of your hand. My son liked it. Very colorful and sturdy for active toddlers."
5,Great infant starter book!,"I bought this to begin reading to our 6-month old granddaughter when she visits every week.The pictures hold her attention, and she loves it when I open the flaps and make the sound ofthe animal shown. The length of the book is just right. I wasn't sure I'd like the ""chunky"" size,but it's great."
4,Portable and very interactive,"I too selected book primarily as it was an inexpensive book ( with good reviews) which helped meet a free shipping requirement ! what a gem.. Small yes, but my 14 month old son loves it !.The flaps are beautifully designed into the pictures and it is such a delight to see his face light up each time we lift a flap. . Yes the flaps are a little snug, but we do it together.. I loosen them as he turns the page and he then thinks he is doing it all alone ! Its nice and small, so its very transportable. I was looking for more of these... Zoo animals ???"
4,Good book for a 1 or 2 year old,"This books associates animals with sounds and is great for a child who dose not yet read. There are no words, you make the sound of the animal and your child is suppose to identify the correct animal. There is a flap that hides a picture of the correct animal that you can open to display the correct answer. Fun little book but quite redundant and not challenging enough for a kid that already reads."
4,Cute simple book,"This book is simple and cute. It's a nice size for little hands and sturdy too. The flaps are a bit difficult to open when you first get the book, and I actually tore a few of them. All in all, this is a cute book to introduce animal names and sounds to a young child."
5,A hit at our house!,My 1-year-old loves this book! It is small so he can hold it himself and it fits in the diaper bag. He loves the animals and finding them hidden behind the flaps. I can't tell you how many times we've read it since Christmas. I would definitely recommend it.
3,great product and concept,"i got this because its a board book and hoped it would resist toddler tearing. it did not. he pulled off all the tabs when i wasnt looking, one day. however we keep it and look at it a lot. he didnt do anything other than tear off the doors. the rest of its fine for reading and durable."
4,Cute but small,"I got this for the newest member of our family to start his book collection going. I was hoping for something a little bigger, but it will be great for travel."
3,Flaps too hard to open,"The flaps are too small for my 13-month old son to open -- they just end up frustrating him. I would think there's a way to make the flaps easier to open, if with keeping the book pocket size."
5,My daughters' favourites,"I bought this book for my second daughter when she was still in my womb! I got it after seeing it how my friend's kids adore it. As it turns out my daughter absolutely loves it. She is now 18 months old and picks this book daily to read over and over and over... The pictures are simple, bright and clear. She loves to lift the flaps and see which animal is waiting for her and we both giggle our hearts out as we make the sounds together. A pure joy of a book for both child and adult. The favourite series of my older daughter isWhy Some Cats are Rascals, Book 1."
2,"Very small, flimsy flaps to open","This book is tiny. Much smaller than I thought it would be. My 11 month old still enjoys it, but has already torn some of the flaps."
4,Small book with small flaps,"This is about the size of your palm so it is really small, which makes the flaps inside each page even smaller -- sort of reminds me of the books you can get at the dollar store... I realize we're in the decade where everything is fashionably smaller so are we making smaller books too? Even my fingers had a hard time opening some of the flaps. Good thing daddy knows how to make animal sound effects when he reads this to our 11 month old so she smiles & squeals! Love the brightly colored pictures and when my baby is an older toddler, I think she'll have fun with this guessing game: ""Who says moo? A cow."" Book also features pig, chick, pony, ducklings, goat, dog, cats, rooster, and owl."
4,"Small & quick, but good","Our 2.5 son received this for Christmas - is it very small and we get through it quickly, but he LOVES to sing ""Old McDonald had a farm"" so this was perfect for him!"
1,too small,Not what I thought it was going to be. Too small and grandson did not like it. Needs to be bigger
3,Cute but small,"The book is smaller than I was picturing. It is cute and it is a book for kids, nothing spectacular"
2,"The 4 oz size is a liquid measure, beware","If you were thinking of storing 4 ounces of spices, or tea, or anything solid in these tins, you will find them way too small.it turns out that the tins will store 4 ounces of water, but less than 2 ounces of any spice, or tea, etc.I ended up sending them back."
3,"A kind of ""best of"" Galactica 1980","Though, I do agree that the G'80 series was horrible, it did have some interesting moments. ""The Return of Starbuck"" was obvoiusly the best episode. ""Conquest of Earth"" starts off with the first part of ""Galactica Discovers Earth"" , then skips the stupid subplot and goes right into ""The Night the Cylons Landed"". Thank goodness they edited all the stupid scenes from it though. I think maybe Glen Larson released ""Conquest"" to kind of squeeze something good out of G'80. One review on here said that there was no explanation as to the two Dr' Zee's. Actually there is a redub in ""Conquest"" that mentions that one is Dr. Zee and the other is his brother Dr. Zen. For the most part, ""Conquest"" is not a great movie, but it's much better than the entire series of Galactica 1980."
2,The Best Part Of A Horrible Follow-Up Series,"Conquest Of The Earth is a made for video movie composed of two episodes from Galactica 1980, the short-live follow-up series to Battlestar Galactica. ABC realized they had made a mistake by canceling Galactica so soon, so they quickly revived it as Galactica 1980.As much as I loved Battlestar Galactica, Galactica 1980 was a laughably horrible sci-fi show. Fortunately, Conquest Of The Earth is made up of two episodes which were among the best of the series. I think it's an interesting movie with some good points. Too bad the ending does not give a conclusion to the problem of the Cylons closing in on Earth. There's enough there to satisfy the curiosity seekers, but not much else."
1,don`t waste your time on this!,"what a mess! i mean it would have been better if they just put two episodes in on one tape as two episodes. first they took parts from at least four differrent episodes of both galactic 80 and battestar galactica. ( Baltar was never in any galactica 80 episodes.) i preferre it when the producers would just release these shows in their original form. the first tv series i ever saw do this was the short lived gemini man. but back to the review they chopped, paste, redubbed and mascre this to the point you couldn`t follow the plot at all! even if all the tv shows were lost i would want to see this piece of junk ever again!"
3,1980 galactica,"combines episodes of part of the not so great spin off, but its not that bad and worth checking out for the memories."
2,TruTech = you get what you pay for,"Looking for a small kitchen flat panel TV that wasn't an undercabinet model led us to the TruTech. Nice design in a nice package, but picture quality is poor at best. I guess I should have suspected as much when I noticed that it was the only model not set up in the store. At $100 less than the next ""name brand"" alternative ($188) I was willing to take a chance on the quality by mixing in a 3YR warranty purchase. Unfortunately, even with the multiple picture quality options we can't get to a quality level that isn't flat panel circa 1990. I must confess that we have a high quality digital signal courtesy of Dish Network and Sony VEGA tubes in the house which holds anything up to a high standards. However, after hooking our 10YR old 13"" Toshiba tube with integrated VCR, side-by-side with our new TruTech and seeing the dramatically reduced quality of this flat panel during NFL highlights we've decided to take back the TruTech. $188 saved."
1,Worked Fine....for 16 months,"We bought this television for our kitchen at Target right after Christmas on special. It suited our needs, worked great with a picture that was fine. However, after 16 months, it failed.It was a bargain that wasn't a bargain."
1,19 Month Bargin,"TV was a Christmas present in 2005, 19 Months later it is a large case with a flashing red LED in the grill......"
5,Proud to be Native Amercian Female Singer/song writer,"Larae's music is so relaxing to listen to. Every song there's a personal meaning to and can relate to the words and meaning. I'm very proud of this beautiful American Indian lady, we need more Native Women like LaRae out there in our music business."
5,9 to 5 Victorian Style,Trollope covers broad range of life in this wonderfully amusing tale of three very diverse clerks and the career paths they take in Victorian England. He depicts them with depth and sympathy and you can't help feeling sorry for the plights their own follies bring upon them. Trollope knew the life he wrote about from his own eventful and long remembered career as a postal worker! Romance and vivid scene painting combine with social comentary to make Three Clerks a classic worth reading for pleasure as well as for the cultural history education it offers.
3,Trollope fan..........,"Great book if you are a Trollope fan & are attempting to read all of his books. If you are familiar with his style then it isn't hard to get into the rhythm after a chapter or two. However for the casual reader, they might feel that a pat on the back was in order if/when they actually finish the book."
4,Good design-bad reception!,"Design is really good, much better than Pioneer SE-DIR800C! Ear cushioning comfortable, closing the entire area. I didn't feel it inconvenient after a couple of movies in a row.Transmitter works well as a charger/cradle too with a fast charging time(I experienced only 1.5 hours for the first time).Surround sound was quite good but I missed a little more bass. Volume can be adjusted easy.Reception was very weak after a short distance. I left my room(and the transmitter) about 15 feet and the signal was breaking up!The most bothering thing is the continous RF warning beeping. This happens if the transmitter doesn't get ""sound signal"" anymore from the TV/VCR/DVD player after 5 minutes. The warning would be enough for 2-3-4 beeps instead of the current neverending one...After all I found the price($199) fair for this product."
2,Beware!,"Purchased this item for gaming on the PS3. Sounds great when working but it WILL kill you Internet connection with your router. I have talked to SONY customer support and they acknowledge the problem but will not support the issue. According to customer support because it says RF signal on the box this states that it may cause problems with other RF items in your house. I was flexible enough to use a fix if one was available, but was told, ""you can not connect to the internet while using this item"". My wireless phones use RF signals and they don't have problems with the routers. I will return this item and WILL HAVE TO PAY FREIGHT AND RESTOCKING FEE."
5,accomplished what it was supposed to,"These Micropur tablets work well and are very convenient for camping. I have used them a number of times to purify water from clear mountain streams at 12,500 foot elevations to stagnant, muddy rain water at very low elevations. Each time I used them, I avoided any illness from contaminated water. I have and will buy them again."
2,permanent chemical burns?! Bwaaaa?,"I'm putting together a survival kit and these tablets seemed like a perfect addition to a pocket-sized kit... until I read all the warnings. ""DANGER: Corrosive. Causes irreversible eye damage and skin burns. Harmful if absorbed through skin... Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. wear safety glasses, protective clothing and rubber gloves. Wash hands and contaminated clothing after handling.""These are pure chlorine dioxide tablets! Packing these corrosive tablets in right next to the rest of my survival gear seems ludicrous. I'm giving this a bad review because the product description is misleading. ""Ultralight drinking tablets provide drinking water anywhere you go... oh, and you should make sure to pack a chemists' fatigues and be prepared to shower after using"""
4,Does the job. Easy to clean.,"Does a good job grinding and the removable bowl makes it easy to clean. Smaller size isn't great for large quantities, but makes enough for a 12 cup pot. Stainless surface has been easy to clean and fingerprints haven't been a problem. Highly recommended."
5,Wish I still had it!,"Factory re-conditioned items don't come much better than this Cuisinart. I bought one while overseas, and it worked like a champ! My only regret is that I left it... the ones you get at Walmart may be less expensive, but that just means you'll buy more of them in the long run (plastic breaks, etc...) - this little tank is steel and will last longer than most celebrity marriages. If you're looking at it, you know you want it. Just get it. You will be glad you did."
1,Loved it for almost a year,"The size is great. Loved how it matched my coffee maker ... looked great sitting beside it. But with only 10 months use, it stopped working without any warning. My guess is that I used it probably once every three weeks which equals approximately 12-14 total uses. Very disappointed especially since I always felt that Cuisinart was a top of-the-line name. As a result, I will probably think twice or never purchase another Cuisinart product."
5,Never enough gadgets,"I debated getting a grinder since I buy my coffee grinded. Also, there is no shortage of appliances in my kitchen. But, after I made a decision to add flaxseed to my diet, I made room for a grinder. Let me say Cuisinart is one of those reputable appliance names, so it was a no-brainer purchasing this one. Although, I was hesitant doing so since it was remanufactured. When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. One would have never guessed it was reconditioned. It was nicely sealed with no visible signs of handling and usage. I have been using my grinder several times a day and have had no problems. It is extremely simple to use and clean. Of course, it has not been a month. But, for what I paid, I have no regrets."
5,MORETHAN HUMAN LESS THAN SATISFACTORY,"While I found the premise very interesting and enjoyed reading how the gestalt functioned, I found the ending of the book to be something of an anti-climax. I am not, however, advocating that the book should have ended with a rather spectacular confrontation between the two protagonists, but I found the tearful entry into a benevolent world consciousness somewhat maudlin.."
4,More allegory than science fiction,"""More Than Human"" is a strange book indeed, filled with evocative prose and provocative ideas. It is a stretch to call this book science fiction, but that's where it's usually classified because it deals with ""supernatural"" phenomena and contains technology-based plot developments. But it's really a book about the human condition, especially at the edges of humanity. There's no other work quite like it; imagine a bizarre version of Catcher In The Rye with an idiot-savant Norman Bates as the central character, and you'll have a vague idea... but even that's not really close. I'd give this 4.5 stars if that were possible on Amazon."
3,Really? One of the finest ever?,"I've read the praise and then read the book... and came away only mildly entertained.""One of the greatest/finest science fiction books ever!""Really?The book is presented in three parts. The first describes the completely coincidental meeting of supporting characters. The relationship of Lone and his adoptive parents is very sad and wanting. Part two, the best part of the book, introduces the self-absorbed antagonist of the story, and really picks up the pace. Then part three crawls out of the gate. A slow, empty plod, only picking up halfway through before addressing any elements introduced in the first two sections. More than once I wanted to abandon it out of bored frustration.The novel wraps up nice enough, but I feel this book is very much of the moment. I've read multiple Lem and Bester novels which trounce MORE THAN HUMAN."
1,"Not a novel at all, but merely a rehash of three stories.","This book is one of those all too common fraudulent conglomerations found in science fiction: stale stories reworked into a ""novel."" Simak gave us the ""novel,"" City, composed of rehashed stories with tacked on intros. Now we get 3 of Sturgeons's stories rebranded into a slim and slick little softcover for four bucks a story. Such a deal.Baby Makes Three, Morality and The Fabulous Idiot are the three stories here. Good stories they are. Good writing they are. But a novel they ain't.If you want to read Sturgeon, and read him you should, then get his collected storiesA Saucer of Loneliness: Volume VII, The Complete Stories of Theodore Sturgeonand skip this rip off."
2,Disappointing&#65533;&#65533;.,"What a wonderful concept for this book, written by one of the ""old masters"" of SF, and a beginning that sucks you in and compels you forward....then drops you flat on your face where you pick yourself up and ask ""Why did this book interest me again?"" Starting off with well rounded characterizations, and prose that takes us rapidly into some very bizarre lives; it ends with flat, paper thin characters, dialogue that is stilted and surrealistic when it shouldn't be, and the knowledge that what should have been accomplished was not. The multiple characters had a compulsion to meld in the beginning, and in the end it is not even the characters we expected and they do not meld at all in my opinion, only mish-mash into a single character with a weak explanation of ""themselves"" as humanity. Pah! A mere 188 pages, this none the less took me three days to slog through. Save yourself the trouble and pass on this one."
4,Super Reader,"I was pretty amazed the first time I came across this book. It is structured in 3 parts - novellas/novelettes, or what have you.The basic premise is that Homo Gestalt is coming. Children that develop and relate to people differently than Homo Sapiens. The characters here included a telepath, a telekinetic, a couple of teleporters, and an infant genius.Broadly speaking, the first part, as you would expect, is about their coming to be, the second, exploring what they are going to do, and the third, more about their influence on society.It is rather more hopeful than the feared and hunted X-Men type milieu."
5,gestalt!,"bless you! lol... sorry, but you just have to read it for yourself... Freaks will love it and everything by Sturgeon..."
2,YAWN,"wow.... how interesting...(yawn) another snide patronizing book about the Catholic Faith. In between the sneers I'm supposed to be impressed. So 1970's!!! Here's a thought! Some people actually take the truth of the Catholic Faith and all its beauty seriously! Truth can be challenging, so many ignore or belittle it."
1,stops working,"It only gets one star because Amazon won't let me give it a zero. Used it a handful of times and it worked well- then took it out to use again after 4-6 weeks and that was it.... no steam, just a grinding noise noise when you pushed the button. I've been trying to get it to work for a few days but nothing. A piece of junk, don't waste your money."
2,This steamer sucks!,"..To be honest. i wanted to get a strong steamer and have been looking around to buy one.After researching and comparing i decided to go with this one- what a waste of money and time.Though it clearly says the power is high 1300/1500 was it?i dont remember;it dosent get the job done.it puffs and huffs,alot of steam seem to come out,yet-hardly nothing change in the process;if u were looking to clean,strighten,etc with the prudcut,it doesnt happen.i think the hole of which the steams come out is too small,or maybe the heating device is not strong enough? Either way,Do urself a favore and just DONT BUY !:)"
2,not what I expected,"I ordered this to steam my suits. It comes with a bunch of attachments and no instructions on what they're for, but none of them are good for steaming wrinkles out of clothes. Some of them look like they'd make good torture devices, or take the paint off your car if you wanted. It actually added wrinkles to one suit so I had to dry clean it. Overall, it kicks out a lot of steam and heat, but frankly I'm not sure what the hell you could use it for. It certainly should not be used on clothes."
3,Not that Great of Quality,"I really like this tea in their teabags, so I thought I'd be getting better quality by purchasing loose tea.It's not any better quality than what comes in the tea bags, and it's very powdery, so one still has to use a filter while brewing it. Might as well buy the product in teabags."
1,An insult the this poor girls memory,I was hoping to see a faithful retelling of the story of Annelise. Instead the only thing faithful is the actual audio clips of her suffering. You get very two dimensional acting here. The girl playing Annelise does do a decent job but everybody else feels like the are just reading line they have just memorized. Even as a found footage it falls flat because it feel acted. The best part about found footage stuff is that it is not suppose to feel acted. Its supposed to feel real. This does not feel real. It feels cheap.
3,One of Asylum's worst,"I am a big fan of Monster, Paranormal Entity, and Gacy House. All 3 are found footage style movies meant to cash in on the popularity of Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity. This newest found footage movie from Asylum, The Exorcist Tapes, continues the trend by copying The Last Exorcism. But while the other copycat movies were pretty entertaining, this one just falls flat. The acting is worse then usual for Asylum and the story just isn't interesting.Asylum, if you're reading this, please stop with the needless nudity and sex in these types of movies. They take away all credibility. Look at Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity, REC, Cloverfield, etc... None of them use sex appeal and they are leagues better then your stuff.. Something for you to consider."
2,"FUNNIER THAT ""REPOSSESSED""!","HA HA HA HA HA...I kept thinking of ""This Is Spinal Tap"". Don't buy this but check your local library (where I found it) or some other poor sap who fell for the hype. This is the most extreme lie shot on film I've run across in recent memory. Yes, anyone related to the real girl should sue the pants off Asylum. The only thing that may be true here is some audio snippets but they're buried in the muck. You have been warned!"
2,"Very Scary,Wish I knew more German ?","Discovered by: Jude Gerard Prest.This is amazing footage archived from Documentary,Germany '76.This is what all those Hollywood movies copied,culled from,abused for profit.The poor girl goes through hell and its so sad,The ending is foretold.She channels Adolf Hitler and Satan and speaks in Greek.The footage of deaths she had a part in is shocking and yet felt they were gonna happen no matter what.Seen many b-movies,And didnt recognize anyone...Its real,Damn reel."
2,"Waverly sheets not just yellow, but floral","These sheets came not just in yellow (solid color) like I thought from the description but yellow with big purple lilacs on them. They are ugly but soft. Poor description, misleading."
2,Many visible imperfections,"These sheets seemed quite thin compared to other flannel sheets and had many visible imperfections. There were small white spots and places where a thread had come loose and balled up. All in all, I would not buy them again. I almost never use them, choosing instead to use the much better Wamsutta flannel sheets that I bought for the same price ($10)."
4,These sheets are soft and gorgeous!,"I'm very pleased with these sheets. The are so pretty, and they fit my bed very well. I didn't expect super heavy-weight flannel for the price, and I got just about what I expected. But that is not to say that the sheets are thin or cheaply made. They're just fine and I think I'll get many years of wear from them. Well worth the price!"
3,Does everyone have this problem with new sheets????,"We did a lot of research on sheets before deciding on this manufacturer. They got high marks for accurate thread counts and quality. Accourding to user eviews, they had no problems with the fitted sheet fitting! Though by todays standards our mattress is thin, it was much thicker than the one it was replacing (12-13 inches). We were very concerned that our new sheets fit. Well, the fitted sheet did fit! But the top sheet is too small!! It cannot be tucked on the sides which causes a big problem when two people are in the bed. The top sheet barely covers us (and we are of average build)! I would love to know if buying bed sheets is becoming like buying 2 X 4s? Do we now have to plan to add extra material every time we buy new sheets???"
1,I also received floral sheets instead of yellow solid sheets,"This must be an error on the Amazon website because the same thing happened to me that happened to the other customer who wrote a review- lilac and vine sheets arrived with the same information as the solid yellow. Apparently the same product, but with the wrong description online! These are FLORAL sheets!"
1,Propagating the Myth,"Unfortunately, having done a lot of research on the subject, I find that this book only furthers the gossip and myths surrounding Rasputin, rather than expounding on the less sensationalist reality of his life."
4,full but out of date treatment of rasputin,"It would be hard to give a full and satisfactory account of the life of Rasputin. His exploits -- from duping the Romanov family into thinking he had magic powers, to holding marathon orgies -- were astonishing in their breadth and weirdness. This book, whose title is taken from an anti-Rasputin pamphlet published near the end of his life, does as good a job as any of explaining who he was and where he came from. It was first published several years ago, so it is somewhat out of date with historical scholarship."
4,Really cute,"As always, Little Rabbit is completely endearing. Stretching his independence, but under Mama's watchful eye, Little Rabbit strikes out on his own and moves in with his friend Molly Mouse. A return to living by Mama's side is to be expected and it's not the most original plot, but every page's illustrations can be poured over as you notice all of the precious details."
2,"We LOVE Little Rabbit, but the content of this title might be frightening for wee ones","My daughter (almost 4) adores the Little Rabbit books. The other titles by Harry Horse are more appropriate for very young children. I personally don't like introducing the concept of ""running away from home"" and ""living with another run-away rabbit"" to my young daughter. We read it once, and she asked me ""why would anyone run away from home?"" Perhaps we just aren't ready for it. We are highly educated and love fun books though.........try Skippyjon Jones!"
3,Doesn't get very cold,"Strangely, despite being in my freezer for days at a time, these just don't hold the cold. They're nice and cold for about 5 minutes and then rapidly reach room temperature."
4,Ice Packs for School Bumps,"I am happy with this product and would like to order more, but see that they are not currently available."
2,I think it was a very dull book. That's my opinion.,"Well it started out with a man sitting in his living room with 2 dogs and a cat on the floor. And the author told us that the animals didn't belong to him and he was keeping them for a family that had to go away. He was going to go away on a hunting trip and was leaving the animals with the house keeper. He wrote her a note and part of it blew away and bruned in the fire. He went away and the animals ran away tring to go home. The house keeper came and found part of the note and figured the guy had taken the animals with him. And that's the last thing I remember because I got bored and stopped reading. I don't like books that don't interest me. I didn't like how she didn't say the animals names and just refered to them as the old dog, the cat, the young dog. Some other people may like it, but I didn't."
2,"The book was ok,but it wasn't very exciting.WelW","Well At frist I didn't understand, but after I read it somemore it all came to me.Personaly I would not read it again. Because it didn't have much action and the names of the animals through me off a bit. Other than that my favorite part was when the lxyn started chaseing after the cat, Tao.I think that if you like books about animals and adventure with a little action then I would recomend this book. But I am the kind of person that doesn't like stories with animals in it. Other than that The Incresible Journey is a pretty good book."
2,Not so good book,I would have liked the animals to have told the story. I thought the movie was 10 times better than the book. I had to read this book for school & I hated it. Don't read this book
4,The Incredible Journey,"Well it started out with a man sitting in his living room with 2 dogs and a cat on the floor. And the author told us that the animals didn't belong to him and he was keeping them for a family that had to go away.

I didn't like how she didn't say the animals names and just refered to them as the old dog, the cat, the young dog. Some other people may like it, but I didn't.I like this book it was really good and I enjoy this book too."
3,Running Around in Circles,"I remember reading this book in grade school and loving it. I decided to revisit the book as an adult and I could not believe this was the same book that I loved. I could not wait for the book to end.The premise of this book is three animals are left behind by their owner. This creates their mission of going to what they perceive to be the owner's destination. With a name like ""The Incredible Journey"", you would assume that the animals got somewhere. The reality is that they got lost and had to have the humans find them. The author had to deal with a disadvantage in writing this story as the animals can not talk. So the author spends most of the book descibing scenery or talking about the animals' next prey.I kept waiting for something to happen in this book. It never did. Instead, I feel like I read 150 pages of three animals walking around in circles."
4,Mom,"This is the best way to deliver books!!!!through kindle....yeah kindle..not only do you get it immediately, it is great for the environment."
2,I have tried I REALLY have!,I have tried to read this book many times over the years and I just cannot get excited about it. Which terribly bums me out because I adore both the original Incredible Journey movie and the Homeward bound movies :( I cannot pinpoint what I dislike about it because I want so badly to like the book. I think it is probably something in the authors writing style that I just can't enjoy.The first time I tried I got about 30 pages in and gave up. A few years later I got a bit further than that. Eventually I managed to finish it but promptly forgot that I had read the whole thing so I tried again a few years later and remembered that I did read the whole thing. So while I adore the concept I cannot get through the book. And I can read most anything. Fair warning that you may have this problem as well.I am giving it 2 stars because I know it is not a bad book. I just cant seem to like it.
5,It was ... and is ... the best book I have ever read.,"In a way, I am afraid to read 'The Incredible Journey' again. Often, you may see advertisements with people commenting on the best book they have ever read; it is always a recently published book. I am 40 years old now, and first read 'The Incredible Journey' as a child. The love of the pets, the longing to reach their owner, their anguish and triumph touched me deeply, as no story had ever done. I read the book a few years again after that, and happily, the effect was the same. It was then, and so still must be, the best book I have ever read. That, I will always remember."
3,The Incredible Journey Review,"I think that the Incredible Journey Book is really good. I like it because it has lots of adventure and lots of different points of view. The beginning is pretty boring but gets exiting soon, like around the setting change. The things I don't like are the excessive phone-talk, and I-know-what-will-happen-feeling that it gives you. Overall I would rate it between Harry Potter and your barely-better-than-average book that you will find. The fun of it is that you never know the detailed parts outcome which has great effect in this book. I think it is very original to make the characters split up for some time and rejoin the others. I like the lazy feeling that I'm not interested. See you later -- don't care about friendship. These parts are very amusing. It may sound predictable of the ending but it is so exiting that you never consider thinking of a different part of the book because it's so addicting. I recommend this book to public readers."
3,This book was good,"The courageous journey of three animals running away from home in search of their family. A young Labrador retriever, the roguish bull terrier and a indomitable Siamese cat set out no a journey though the Canadian wilderness in search of the family that loves them dearly. The three house pets must survive without being eaten buy bigger animals, starve to death, and exposure."
3,The book was action pack and full of aventure,"I gave this book three stars because the begginning wasn't to interresting.As the story possesed the story got bettr than it was at the begginning.My favorite one was Bodger.I like the way he alway backed up the Labidor and Tao.They stuck together and went the distance.They met mzny people along the way too.I'll name a few:Mackenzies,Mrs and Mr.Oakes,and the Ojuways.The writer of this story did a excellent job on this book.I think that the ending could have been a little better."
4,This was a great book and I think every one should read it!!,I'v read this book the Incredible Journey and I think this book is great and it is verydeep and sometimes hard to understand because I'm in grade 6 and I don't understand some of the words. Over all I think this is a great book and the auther has put so much detail it's great. Four *
1,Very Boring Book!,"This book stinks so bad. I had to read it for school and I would never read it if I had a choice. It was very boring because it had very little action. If I had it my way, I would have stopped reading this book after the first page. It starts out with a guy on his rocker with three animals by a fire. The animals are supposedly not his and they go out searching for their original owners. I would not recommend this book to any human beings alive. This book is very boring."
3,The Incredible Journey,"Our names are Amiee and Nicole and we are from North Broward Preparatory School. We read the book,The Incredible Journey for an English Project. It was a good book. The beginning of the book was little boring. Other than that, it was pretty exciting. It was a very adventurous story. The Disney movies, The Incredible Journey and Homeward Bound were based on the book, but had some differences. At the beginning of the book, the animals run away from their current owner, in search of their original owners and home. Along the way, they run into many obstacles. If you are a pet lover and like adventures, this is a good book to read."
3,The Incredible Journey,This is a heartwarming story with discripive phrases throughout. Very enjoyable for both my grandson and myself.
3,They had a big adventure by theirselves in the wilderness.,"In this story I saw a stage of living a real life.It's telling you how the animals felt, and the oners.In this story you also find out what the animals are saying.When they need food they work together to get it.They found a lt about the world it self.They also found out they can survive.That's what I got out of the story that I read."
2,This was a enjoyable book.,"I really like this book. It was exiting and it keep me reading it night after night. I think it could of had alittle more action, but other than that it was enjoyable. My faverite part was when the cat had an encounter with the lynx."
2,THEY HAD AN ADVENTURE ON THEIR JOURNEY,The incredble journey a good book it had good parts in it and it was cool that their was animals got lost. They had a big adventure. It was also funny about the the cat and the dogs argue. I think it is cool that two dogs and a cat could make that long journey. with out getting killed so they were mus been smart.
4,Wow,"Wow this was a wonderful and exciting book that keeps you hooked and wanting to read more all through the Book! I never thought that book would be so, so good, especialy because none of the animals talk at all in the book. Although some times it does tell about their feelings, it is still an amazing book. I recomend it to everyone who loves animals and a good book. It is truely an amazing book."
3,I think it's BORING!,I think it's really boring. And I liked the movie Homeward Bound much more. I had to read in my literature group and I'm a fast reader so I had to go back and because this book is not very exciting it got really BORING! Right now I'm not done with this book but by the time you read this I probably will be.
2,The incredible book,Awesome book 5 stars cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool and more cool cool cool cool
4,Incredible journey,It was a good book very dicriptive. itvwas good good good goof good good good awesomeness intresting good good go
3,Practical & Historical,"A historical background is utilised in the area of high pressure water blast cleaning with detailed references to pump types and selection thereof. CIP processes and equipment are detailed. This book obviously has been derived from many years of practical experience of the author and may not incorporate the latest technology. Case studies are included which are of interest.What is not included is the pre-operational cleaning of plant or the process cleaning of operational plants from a chemical perspective, details of chemicals utilised, temperatures and length of cleaning periods are all excluded.."
3,Worst Subtitles,"I have purchased this item recently, i love the film itself cant fault it, but i brought my disk from ""asiandvd2"" and this has the worst english subtitles ive ever come across, it is uncomprehensible! so please be weary of this."
4,Shmorgasboard of information!,"This is a wonderful resource! At our church we give this as a gift to all new members. It provides them with not only a quick summary of historical and theological nuts and bolts in the PCUSA, but answers a lot of questions folks from other denominations have regarding worship, marriage, and structures in our churches. A lot of new members page through and say, ""Oh, I have always wanted to know that!"" From understanding what Presbyterian Disaster Assistance is, to One Great Hour of Sharing, to the Presbyterian News Service, this is a shmorgasboard of good information. Two drawbacks...there is no index or table of contents."
5,The Most Outstanding Band No One Knows About (Part 1),"An excellent debut album from a band that never quite made it in the mainstream. The songs are catchy, but with a hard edge. Not a bad song on the album."
3,A Pale Comparison,"Every now and then, I pick up one of Monk's 60s recordings hoping to find the exception to the rule that he spent the decade trying to regain the glory of the late 50s. I haven't found it yet. Stick to the Riverside recordings."
5,Best Bra Ever,This Bra is the only one i've ever gotten that has a wonderfully firm hold yet streches perfectly to my curves
4,Excellent sports bra,"My wife needed a sports bra so I decided to purchase one for her. After having tried she only wants to purchase these.Points for me for finding them,great buy."
2,Runs really small,"I ordered a Medium in this Sports Bra, I'm 5'4"" weighing 124 lbs. with a 32B bra size. It was so small I couldn't get it on. I sent it back for a refund because I don't think even a large would have fit."
5,"Great fit, sporty style","I just received two size mediums and they fit and look great! (I'm 5'7'' and 137 pounds, size 34B.) In fact, I'm on this web site because I'm thinking of ordering a couple more!"
2,Puzzled,"I'm puzzled reading the reviews for this product--do they make two different bras under the same description? I wear small/medium in clothes and am very small in the bust (A maximum). I ordered this sports bra in medium for cycling (All my other sports bras are mediums and fit nicely). It looks great/high quality--2 stars. When I put it on I couldn't believe it. I have absolutely no idea how anyone who is not completely flat-chested can comfortably wear it. Even I with the small amount I have was mashed completely flat and felt like I was being suffocated. Now that's a SUPPORT bra! And, like one other reviewer stated, the armholes are very high and cut into my underarm. I wondered if ordering a size large might help and it might a little, but it's hard to believe there would be enough give even then to accomodate me, small as I am, in the bust area.Anyway, for what it's worth..."
1,Size is WAY too small...,"Based on other reviews, I bought the next larger size and STILL had a problem. To make the bra work for me, I took off the binding around the neckline and arm holes and removed a heavy strip of rubber from each. I then resewed the bindings and the bra is more comfortable, but still is not the size I ordered. I would recommend a different bra if possible."
1,Poor quality on Delta 2 grinders,"I purchased this grinder from a local store. When I received it, not only was the light crushed from manufacturing (NOT shipping, based on the packaging condition), but the wheels shimmied from side to side over 1/8"" of an inch. I took it back to the store who immediate ordered a new one for me. When I got the second one, the motor makes a bad noise, though the grinding wheels are somewhat better than than the first - but not good. I'm taking it back today and ask for my money back.I thought I was purchasing a very good quality product in buying a Delta. Unfortunately Delta's quality is lousy. To compare, I have also purchased a Ryobi 8"" grinder at Home Depot. It runs quietly, reliably and the wheels are very true. To bad they don't make a slow speed grinder. I'd buy it (or anything else) over the Delta."
1,Amazon and Delta need to get their act together,"As the previous reviewers have observed, I ordered this item on April 1, 2007 and the April Fool's joke was on me. They are now claiming a November delivery date for the $166 price including shipping. I just bought a Dayton industrial grinder off of Ebay for about the same price so as soon as that one arrives I will be canceling. Amazon refused to do anything and Delta's site question service just said they didn't have these in stock yet Amazon is still taking orders via one of their allied vendors. Shame on all of them.Update, 23 Aug. Now I am convinced that Amazon gave a really late ship date to get people to cancel so they wouldn't have to honor the $166 price instead if getting $250+. Had they told me it would be August, I would have waited. Even more shame on Amazon & Delta."
2,Does not work,"I would not recommend this unit for three main reasons:1. the sound quality is pretty bad with the internal mike and speaker. For taking notes an external mike and speaker is too bulky.2. It does not work when powered by the USB port. You have to unplug it and run off two AAA cells (put in backwards) to play or record.3. There is no USB driver either in firmware, on the CD, at Panasonic or built-into Windows 7. So could not use the computer software to edit sound, or convert sound to text, or manipulate the clips in the device.The notes talk about Win2K and XP. I suspect this is quite an old design, and they have not kept up to date with drivers.Operating is easy. You hit record, talk, hit stop. Hit record, talk, hit stop. Each time you hit record it starts a new numbered snippet. You select which clip you want to hear by spinning a wheel, then hit play. You would never guess it was that simple from the plump instruction book."
2,?????,"I AM SURE THAT THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT, HOWEVER,I TESTED THE RECORDING AND STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PLAYBACK WHAT i RECORDED. I WILL HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE HELP ME FIGURE IT OUT."
3,Stansfield Swaps Soul For Pop,"The first studio album in four years for Lisa Stansfield finds the UK diva veering a ways from her typical mix of blue-eyed soul-pop, with varying degrees of success. The opening double shot of ""Easier"" and ""Treat Me Like A Woman"" easily outdistances anything else on the record, though there are a few more solid tunes in the form of ""When Love Breaks Down"", ""Lay Your Hands On Me"", and ""If I Hadn't Got You""(the one song that sounds closest to alot of her previous work). There's an overriding pop feel to the whole album(in addition to much of the material being from outside writers), probably due largely to the switch in producers from husband Ian Devaney to Trevor Horn. That said, she stills sounds world-class throughout, and though it's not her strongest studio effort(and not as good as the previous FACE UP), it's still better by miles than its DOA position on the UK album chart suggests."
3,The Moment,"I was on a visit to Poland in August 1989 - it was the first time I heard All Around the World on the radio!! I loved it, and immediately became a fan of Lisa's music after that. I loved the R&B / dance / soul style all throughout the 1990s, and pretty much every album, including Face Up. The Moment, however, was a stylistic departure in many ways, as other reviewers have noted. The only thing that I found with The Moment - and I haven't seen anyone else mention this - is that Lisa's voice seems drier, almost parched in some spots... I remember reading some years back that Lisa is a chain smoker. I hope she quits that and takes care of that beautiful voice - it is too great a gift to risk damaging!! But other than that, I await any new albums she may put out with great eagerness."
2,Lisa Goes Pop!,"This CD won't win over any new fans for Lisa. Her past work was soul with a hint of pop. This is probably pop with a touch of rock. When she sang a song you could feel the emotion behind the lyrics. Whatever she was singing about you somehow thought she was living through it herself. You just don't get that with this record. Of course Lisa's voice is top notch as usual and I applaud her for wanting to change her formula but there is also an argument for fixing something that ain't broke. There are many artists with booming voices that suffer with singing weak pop material ie Whitney Houston, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. Lisa has the voice to take an old soul standard and make you forget about the original ""You Know How to Love Me"" and ""Never Gonna Give You Up"". I give it 1 star for her golden voice and 1 star for ""If I Hadn't Got You"" which is the closest to her older material. Please leave the pop to the Pop Divas!"
5,Spanning the Generations,"Viewed the first two of these with my 4 year old granddaughter. She never got bored, nor did her eyes leave the screen. Same as me, I suppose. Any one with kids about this age would be surprised how perfect silent movies are for them. It goes without saying that you watch with them. I just enjoyed the whole scenario so much. Try it."
3,Pogue's Peace & Love,"I got this because my grandson recommended it. For my generation (I'm 89), it was interesting, and worthwhile to learn what tha gernation likes to listen to, but for me, not my first choice of music."
3,Give Peace a Chance,"Like a brawl in an Irish Pub just before closing time, Peace an Love is back in print! Of course this is NOT intended as a comment on the current administration, but I say: give ""Peace and Love"" a chance....:), go on....try it, it will make your day...."
4,"A Curse Upon You, Oliver Cromwell","The best Pogues LP is the classic IF I SHOULD FALL FROM GRACE WITH GOD.PEACE & LOVE is a strong second place.I suppose the reason the Pogues never hit in the USA is that they are ""too irish,"" just as the Kinks, the Jam, XTC and the Clash were ""too English."" Personally, I think it's because American radio programmers remain ""too stupid"" to recognize good music unless it's packaged and promoted to death.I can listen to this CD all day long--I often do--with the exception of ""Gridlock,"" a misplaced cop-show theme song, and ""Blue Heaven,"" a piece of fluff that must have been slipped onto the master tape by mistake.""Night Train To Lorca,"" ""Misty Morning Albert Bridge"" and the masterful ""London You're A Lady"" are among the best things the Pogues ever recorded."
2,Disappointing,"A huge fan of MacGowan and the Pogues' ""Red Roses for Me"" and ""If I Should Fall From the Grace of God,"" I am horribly disappointed with this album. It begins with a completely out of place swing jazz song, that, when you listen for the first time, will make you think the manufacturer accidentally mispackaged a Big Bad Voodoo Daddy album; though, quite an original intro for an 80's pop folk album. A few tunes resemble the Pogues of albums past (tracks 2, 10 & 11), but they lack the energy and conviction. The rest of the album is, as the title infers, complete hippie-inspired garbage only comparable to the worst of the Grateful Dead.The production is quite different from what you may expect as well, with the trademark banjo, cheerful flute, and MacGowan's vocals toned down or nonexistent on most tracks.If you love early Pogues, do yourself a favor and avoid this one."
3,Passion: A novel,"This book, later the film, is what inspired Stephen Sondheim's musical ""Passion"". Having seen, loved and bought the musical on DVD, I wanted to go to the source.The book is small compared to it's offspring, but I am glad I read it. It only proves that to a master craftsman, the germ of an idea is enough to inspire a masterpiece."
4,Gorgeous Pictures,"While the author Ken Duncan strongly advocates Creationism, this is one of the best picture books on Australia that I have come across! I am bit suprised it is out of print? He does has a great eye for taking pictures!"
1,sooooooo sappy!,"I'm sorry, but this movie is way overblown. Sure, it has a message. Sure, it's heartfelt. But why should I care! Far From Heaven is overly, even repulsively, sentimental, and the message is a political-correctness cliche. I don't have anything against homosexuals or Afro-americans, but there is way too much sentiment surrounding these issues. I'd much rather read the Boondocks to sympathize with Black power, than sit through this dull flick. It's way too long, it's way too boring, and it's so sappy I could vomit! These movies that try to sympathize with the 50's housewife outlook are just so bland, and this one tops them all. If you want a touching movie, see something less sappy, like the Majestic. Now, I'm sorry for being iconoclastic towards this much-loved film, but honestly: someone had to say it!"
4,THESE 1-STAR REVIEWS ARE BEYOND THE PALE,"RACISM and intolerance; that's all I see in these 1-star reviews. Of course no one will ADMIT to it, least of all to themselves. (Betcha can hardly wait to scream and yell and wave inane placards at your next Tea Party.)FAR FROM HEAVEN is a beautifully crafted motion picture. If you grew up in the 50's and are objectively open-minded, you'll enjoy this stylish flick. Ignore the naysayers: their COMMENTS are boring and vacuous and without merit."
3,Good Acting..Weak Story,A relevant look at the Eisenhower fifties of superficial social life in the straight jacket of taboos. The confrontations of sex and race don't find resolution in anything other than resignation to the status quo and so while the ending is plausible (entirely so) you're left wishing that the time invested in watching the film gave you something much more. I suggest renting rather than purchasing as I doubt you'll want to add it to your permanent collection.
5,"Excellent communication, great service","This seller is a credit to Amazon.com. The order was only very slightly delayed, but I received an email from the seller letting me know what had happened and apologizing profusely. When I say slightly, I mean maybe 3 or four days - due to an unexpected circumstance - not a major hardship on me at all.I really appreciated the personal communication and the apology, even though none was necessary. Item arrived well packaged and very timely, in brand new condition as described.Thanks!"
5,Julianne Moore is excellent.,"Excellent acting, I loved Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid. You could feel how the beginning of what freedoms and liberties we take for granted nowadays in our culture were started by people being willing to be honest about their feelings. Homosexuality, interracial relationships, all these taboo subjects that today we talk about openly in many forms.The costume design is exquisite, Julianne Moore is a lovely depiction of the perfect 50's housewife, including her curiosity and caretaker demeanor. Also I enjoyed the lighting in this movie, as it depicts the time authentically."
3,"nicely acted, but","that's really all you can say about FFH. Yes, the themes it tackles are crucially important, but at the same time, I'm forced to agree with others here ... they've been covered countless times, and often better, before. Understand; this remains a very watchable movie, largely for its performances, but, even if you don't wanna, you walk away from it wanting something more plot-wise that never happens, if that makes sense. Not necessarily a different ending, just some more meat on its bones overall. Some parts dragged, it seems, others were handled much too quickly. Worth seeing overall, not owning."
5,"Roses, rainbows, and what lies beneath.","Todd Haynes flawlessly captures a devastating portrayal of suburban rot and dysfunction against a seemingly perfect fifties backdrop.Using the melodramatic style of Douglas Sirk, FAR FROM HEAVEN tells the tale of a wealthy husband and wife (Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid) who run their own business, and are highly respected by their peers. When the husband is caught in a passionate embrace with another man, things change drastically for both he and the rest of his family. Issues such as prejudice, interracial relationships, and spousal abuse are also explored in this magnificent, disturbing film.The performances are excellent all around, and the music score is simply beautiful. Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid both deserved every award that they won for their work here, and Todd Haynes proves that he is an amazing director.BUY IT!"
2,Difficult movie to review...,"This film is like being presented a beautifully arranged meal on a crystal dish atop a silk tablecloth...that tastes bland.Julianne Moore is an astonishing actress - she is so good that I cannot believe she hasn't won an Oscar by now. But while the acting in this film is great, it really leaves you feeling empty and somewhat confused. It is depressing, not because of the subject matter per se, but because there is no lesson to be learned, or truth to be told. If you want to watch great acting, then rent it. But we warned that you'll probably stagger to bed with a headache afterward."
4,Sad film with beautiful pictures,"""Far from heaven"" is another gay-theme episode in Julianne Moore's career (check ""A single man""). This time she portrays a housewife with a husband who lives a lie.I will spare you another briefing here.In a few words: Moore is more than good here. The plot is interesting, although quite sad. It's hard to believe that America used to be like that (blooming bigotry, intolerance etc.).The pictures are amazing. All details let me feel the atmosphere of the 50's.Recommended."
3,"BEAUTY IS BUT SKIN DEEP, AND SPEAKING OF SKIN...","..this movie is a 'color'ful blast from a racist past. Julianne Moore is devastatingly stunning, the costume and set designs are marvellous and the flow of the movie is impeccable. All round excellent production.Yet, something is amiss. Perhaps that atavistic thrill that comes from not being able to predict the next scene in a movie, which sadly is not a luxury ""Far from Heaven"" affords. All its warm but predictable moments lead to a denouement that may be a bit of a let down to many of you.In any case, the characters are developed with picture-perfect tenacity and you're bound to end up feeling the desparation of all of them. The movie touchingly conveys a sense of community and hidden depths of human kindnesses and hypocrisies. Thus, despite its lack of delightful charm, I'd say it is worth a watch if only for its stunning authenticity and drama."
2,further from heaven,"It's difficult to classify this movie--in one sense it's a parody of the sticky-sweet love movies of the 50s (and hence the cinematic effects are appropriate), but it's not funny.Dennis Quaid dramatically overacts his anger and frustrations of not wanting to be gay and explodes without warning (or apparent reason) in a totally un-believeable performance. His romance with ""the blonde boy"" also is unbelieveable as they simply aren't compatible.Julianne Moore is more believeable in her role as the perfect housewife that falls in love with her black gardener, but that's about the extent of credibility in this film.I saw it with a group of 6 men, 2 thought it was great, 4 of us found it incredibly boring and slow."
3,"Ignore the hype, it's not that brilliant","I was eager to see this based on all the hype. The hype was obviously generated to boost interest in a rather dull movie. I cannot fault the acting or the beautiful cinematography, but the storyline is far-fetched in many ways. Take the friendship with Moore and her gardiner - particularly where she goes to lunch with him. It just wouldn't have happened in the 50's. No woman with such a high reputation to uphold would have done that then. On the whole, the film tries to tackle too many issues in the 98 or so minutes. By the time the characters are really starting to develop the film is over - and I could care less about them.A very over-rated piece of film which has been 'disguised' by nice colours and good acting. Just avoid it, it's a let-down."
1,Bad Movie,"This movie sends a good message, but the ""interaction"" between characters deserves this film a 1 star."
1,...but very Close to Hell,"Sorry for the lack of eloquency here, but all I can say is ""dreck, dreck, dreck!"" This movie has concept, but no plot.Slow, boring, minimal conflict, strange overacting and unbelievable reactions from Dennis Quaid...If you are looking for an interesting angle to racial prejudice and closeted homosexuality, keep searching. If you find All My Children overwhelming, and are in need of a more plodding soap opera, then this is the movie for you.God only knows why I stuck through this movie to the end...and end that was so anticlimatic, that I was surprised (yet relieved!) when the closing credits rolled."
1,"Hateful look at the era of ""Happy Days""","The people behind this movie were successful at achieving their vendetta for the fifties. Hollywood has still not got over the blacklisted era and this movie is a good example of ""revenge of the liberal nerds."" I will give them credit for the artful reproduction of the movie style of that era, but their narrow and spiteful agenda produced a superficial movie. I have a warm memory of the fifties ala ""American Graffitti"" and this movie gives no credit to the wonderful aspects of the era. My mother would have been insulted by this movie as I was."
3,I'm grasping at reasons to like this movie...,"I really really really wanted to like this movie. As a old movie buff, i totally enjoyed the sets, costumes, music, opening and end titles, but something just wasn't there. The story of apperance vs. reality really showed how far we have come in terms of acceptance, and the acting, especially by Julianne Moore, was great, but the story was lacking. I found some of the scenes unmotivated, and the ending seemed to be lacking a punch. I think one of the problems was that there was just to many issues trying to be worked through. I believe that a movie about a woman in the 50's finding that her husband was homosexual would have been wonderful, but you throw in racism, woman's repressed sexual issues, children being neglected to keep up apperences, etc, etc...and you have too much going on."
1,Obvious and cliched,"Whether you like this movie will depend upon what you value in movies. It seems to me (and I don't mean disrespect here) that the people who like this movie exhibit what I think of this as the ""film school"" approach to movies. They appreciate a movie for its technical merit, and for references and homage to other movies. (For example, note all the references to Douglas Sirk in the positive reviews.) Coen brother movies often fall in this category.I have to say, however, that I found Far From Heaven to be an overwrought, mechanistic, shallow, predictable, cliched piece of tripe. The actors are terrific, the sets are amazing, yet I found this movie almost completely unwatchable. There was one scene where Julianne Moore leaves the house and runs into Dennis Haysbert in her yard. It was so obvious this would happen that I burst out laughing when it did.Obviously this movie draws widely varying reactions. Your mileage may vary."
1,tell me again why this movie is so good...(?)...,"So it showed the oppression of women, Blacks, and homosexuality in the 50s...Here we are 50+ years later, have we really come that far? We've just become better at hiding it. Slow, boring, empty and unmoving. I can't honestly give it one star."
2,Sorry*- But Not So Hot Afterall*...,"I thought this movie would be better than it was.(?)I'm not sure exactly why I feel this way, but my advice is don't buy it till you see it.Ok to rent- - - but not a keeper* Glad I just rented it*"
1,Far from heaven is far from good,"To me, the best thing about this movie was the opening scenes of the beautiful autumn leaves; I may be the only person who did not like the movie; I tolerated 45 minutes or so and had to leave. I love movies and this is only the second movie I ever walked out on. Just could not stand the saccharin sweetness of Julianne Moore (loved her in The End of the Affair) nor the doofus-ness of that portrayal of the era. I was a wife/mother at that time and never saw anything even vaguely similar to what this movie depicts. What a disappointment; I really wanted to see a good movie that day, not a grade B melodrama. Actually, I did see a good movie that day. After my personal bad choice and disappointment in Far from Heaven, I bought a ticket to Bowling for Columbine; a powerful movie."
1,sucks,Save you money this is one bad movie. Can t beleive Moore made this trash. Must have needed the money.
5,BEST FILM EVER!,"The art direction, story plot and costume is remarkable and accurate! I highly recommend this film to everyone! I can not watch this film enough!"
2,Well done --> TOTALLY forgettable,"It was last night ... what was this about? Oh, right, a man realized he likes men, and a woman realizes she likes a black man. Um, I'm not exactly sure this was educational ...It certainly took itself seriously, especially in set design and visual style. Which trivializes it further ...The acting was perfect. But the movie was pointless."
3,How to cope with a gay husband and other taboos,"This is a story of a seemingly perfect couple with two wonderful children living in a idealized American home in the 1950s. Unfortunately, the husband has been living a lie for most of his adult life. It shows that suppression of sexual preference is difficult at best and generally leads to great heartache for all concerned. Such situations in real life are far more common than many people realize. The public's fascination with the sheepherders' ""love affair"" in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is indicative of the situation in society."
1,0 Stars Anyone?,"This had to be one of, if not the worst movies I have ever seen. And I've seen A LOT. I kept waiting for the story to get going, and it never does. It takes the life of a 1950's woman and pins her with all of our glorious modern problems. I don't think anything like this ever happened, one at a time maybe, but racial conflict, homosexuality, social gossip, abuse, alcoholism, etc, etc, etc all at once? And suprisingly, she handled all too well. Oh, and I would never let a 13-year old watch this. It needed a rating of R. Not to mention, where was the ending of this film? Just has it FINALLY gets around to loading her life with every problem imaginable, the movie simply stopped. I think that it was WAY beneath any actors dignity to do this, but especially Dennis Quaid whom I used to like. Over all this movie was overdramatic, slow, boring, un-entertaining, unrealistic and just plain bad. Save your money for something else, and you won't regret it."
1,"Slow, obvious and boring","While technically impressive, this film is basically a bore, with all the points being made about the 50's lifestyle and bigotry so obvious as to be insulting to the intelligence of the audience. While technically impressive, I could not recommend it to anyone who is in need of sleep because you would nod off within the first five minutes."
3,Could have been better,"It had promises of being a beautiful movie, one with which many of us could relate to. An attempt has been made to make it a poignant movie, but it falls short somewhere. Perhaps its the initial scenes of a picture perfect life. Julianne Moore is a bit too sugary sweet there, trying too hard to potray a contented, well loved and happy wife , mother and friend.Dennis Quaid is very good as the confused man coming to terms with his homosexuality. Dennis Haybert plays his part of a sympathetic and generous friend very well. Perhaps if it hadn't been for the sugary sweetness, this movie would have been a good one."
1,"As the Name Suggests, Far from Heaven is Far from Perfection","This is a poorly written and directed movie of all the time. It is not worth your time as well as your money. Here are the reasons why I think the movie is lousy: First and foremost, it is neither entertaining nor educational. You tell me how entertaining or educational it is when you see a certain father deny his family, both his wife and children, and pursue his selfish, wicked, disgusting lifestyle. ... Secondly, it is EXTREMELY boresome.The negative message the movie presents--hedonistic values--out balances the positive value and norm of our society. ...Anyway, if you haven't seen the movie yet, I suggest you keep your luxury of not exposing yourself to a great deal of unspeakable stupidity in the movie!"
3,Nicely done.,"""Far From Heaven"" is set in upper-crust 1950s New England and depicts the unraveling of the perfect marriage when the husband is unable to cure himself of same sex desires. A parallel story line explores a budding, sinfully sensuous relationship between wife and black gardener. The movie juxtaposes the two forbidden desires in an attempt to sort out the greater of two evils. The movie is wonderfully filmed with all the accoutrements of 1950s motif. Dress, language, style, dénouement . . . all accurately reflects the period. Although I did find many of the interactions between the wife and her taboo desire unrealistic for the era, I was able to take the movie fantasy plunge and stay engaged with the story line. The film moves slowly at times however, excellent acting by the cast help keep the slow periods from being out right boring.Overall a enjoyable flick. There's lots of nostalgia, desire, and temptation. A worthwhile outing."
2,Darned Pretty,"Except for the wonderful period costumes and props, the loving lush wide-angle shots of New England fall foliage, and the always expressive features of Julianne Moore and Dennis Haysbert, this is not a good movie. It is five minutes of earnest questioning - can a 1950's housewife in Hartford, Connecticut, depicted here as a hotbed of racial bigotry and craven upper-class strivings, grow her race- and sex-conscious soul? - preceded by a wearisome hour-long build-up and followed by an unsatisfactory resolution. At best a period piece, at worst Hollywood's version of an Eisenhower-era soap opera, ""Far From Heaven"" never strays from type. Robert E. Olsen"
4,Well worth picking up,"This was the first Julian H. disc that I ever bought, and it still remains among my favorites. It's as solid from start to finish as they come, and what a finish it is. I'm surprised that ""A Crack in the Clouds"" eluded the folks who put together the Floored Genius collections. I must have played ""Pulsar"" about a million times, and ""Spacehopper"" and ""World Shut Your Mouth"" are not that far behind. I also love the arrangements he was using at the time- check out the english horn on ""Saint Julian"", absolutely gorgeous and unique. Since this disc pre-dates both Jehovakill and Peggy Suicide, it is neither as heady and fulfilling as either, but it comes in a close third. Plus this one actually works at parties."
1,Worst camera ever,"I can not say enough how much I would dissuade anyone from buying this camera. During the time it actually worked it ate batteries like you wouldn't believe. You'd be lucky to get 10 pictures out of it before they died. Then, the camera stopped working altogether after a few months (maybe 3 or 4 uses, to be more accurate). It won't even turn on now. Also, I removed the memory card from the camera and put it in my flash drive reader to see if I could recover any of the pics taken over those 3 or 4 months it worked. NONE were there. The directories were there, but the pics were not. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!"
2,battery does not last,I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone. This camera eats up batteries like it was made by Duracell!! I will throw this away and get another one.
4,OK For Only Concert DVD,"For the Bangles only concert DVD, I thought the song selections were just, ok. I mainly got this DVD to watch Susanna Hoffs as she's always great to look at, but of 18 songs the Bangles performed, I only liked half the selections. I wished they had performed ""Be With You"" along with the classics they performed. And from the ""Doll Revolution"" selections I wished ""Tear Off Your Own Head"" and ""Something That You Said"" were played. Now to the hits that they did perform that I like, most weren't perform in its original way. I don't mind if a song or two gets a revamped, but not most of them. Maybe it was just me, but it sure didn't sound like they originally were. Maybe because it's performed live, or I need a few more watching to get used to. Those were my only two gripes, if it weren't for that, this would have been a 5 star rating for me. The special features are good, get to see more of Susanna Hoffs in an interview and perform a couple of acoustics."
3,"Good, but could have been better","While the performance of the band was good, the sound mix, patricularly the 5.1 surround, seem a bit off. The lyrics are drwoned out in the 5.1 mix, and the 2.0 doesn't have all that much sepration. My other complaint with this DVD is that it is in non-anamorphic widescreen, even though it was shot in HD. This should have been released in anamorhpic widescreen, which would have helped it look much better on my HDTV. Instead, I am forced to watch with either bars on all 4 sides, or zoom in for a much grainier, pixelated image."
3,"Great atmosphere, shame about the production","The Bangles live are unadulterated fun. By no means throw-away bubble-gum pop, they write and sing with such great depth of knowledge and a deft, light touch. It is a pity that the sound mix on this DVD is so thin. Vocals are fine, but guitars drum and bass sound like they are recorded on cassette tape, played on a transistor radio. All treble, no body. The contrast with Manic Monday that plays on the menu background is jolting. Much more enjoyable are the two acoustic bonus tracks and the nostalgic commentary track. I saw them live in Sydney and the ballsy muscularity of that show put the DVD recording to shame."
4,Audio quality ruins a great concert,A fun concert with all the original members but i agree with other reviewer that audio quality is lacking.No bottom to it and very trebly.Best way around it is to use 2.0 rather than 5.1 and not to play it too loud.The show itself is great and the band has a lot of fun reworking old and new material.You could do worse than to spend 90 minutes watching susannah hoffs who is still one of the hottest females to ever pick up a guitar.Hope they put out another dvd soon with a new sound mixer.
5,A completely lush remastering,This remastered version enjoys all of the technical benefits of cd format while still retaining the warmth of vinyl. It represents Pink Floyd's best acoustic work. A must own for fans.
5,Unererrated.,"This is definately one of Pink Floyd's most underrated albums of all time. It is amazing. I love the guitar at the end of Sheeps. Pigs on the Wing Part 1 and 2 att a little shorterness at each end of the cd. Dogs, Pigs(Three Different Ones), and Sheep are three awesome songs and it doesn't matter that they're long cause they're a joy to listen to."
3,"Colder-sounding, still a classic Pink Floyd album","This Pink Floyd disc is bookended by short acoustic songs, and then the main songs are long ""Animal Farm""-type meditations. The songs are good, but they don't stand up as well over time as the other PF discs, like ""Dark Side"", or ""The Wall"". The sound is sort of pre-discoey because of the 4 on the floor beat and Roger Water's white funk bass lines. There's animal sounds effects in most of the songs, and David Gilmour's singing was recorded coldly, like through a ... microphone. It all fits the cold theme of the album, though."
3,Not their best. I Gotta Be Crazy!,"I'm a huge Floyd Fan, I even like The Final Cut!, BUT I never understood the hype over this album. OK Dogs is amazing and parts of Pigs, but by the time Sheep comes on I'm always ready to take the needle off and go to sleep."
4,Crank Up The Volume!! - at least on Dogs,"I love cranking up the volume on Dogs. That song rocks! I've been trying to find a copy of that song, but when I look for a copy, it's either lost or damaged. I have yet here the full potential of this CD, if I could ever get my hands on it."
3,Almost The Wall,"I like this CD, I think mainly becuase I remember listening to it when it first came out and it brings back memories. But it is not one of Pink Floyd's best. If you're just getting started on Floyd they have better stuff than this that you should start on. Dark Side of the Moon is of course their best. The Wall, Wish You Were Here, excellent. Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Saucer Full of Secrets, great if you don't mind having an acid flashback. Animals, though, falls a bit short. Roger Waters says it was really just a kind of study they did for The Wall, and I have no reason to disagree with him. It has its moments, but it's not great.Buy it if you're really into Floyd. If not, don't."
2,The beginning of the end of the Floyd,"A good half of the songs on this album are in the key of G; sit down with the guitar and figure them out yourself. Why? Because Roger Waters wrote a majority of them, and came up with the lyrics, which are beginning to show the vile pomposity that made ""The Wall"" and ""The Final Cut"" impossible to listen to. Waters' second-rate junior college philosophy class existentialism, and his attempts to be up-to-date by pointing fingers at social problems just like the punks of the day, sounds terribly dated now, as does the meandering, aimless and dull songwriting. The best thing about this record is David Gilmour's singing and guitar playing. Other than that, there is very little to recommend it."
1,The Worst Commercial CD from Pink Floyd,"This has to be the worst CD Pink Floyd ever put out. I compare it to trying to watch a bad movie and after 10 minutes viewing you just have to shut it off. PF has done much better. I will always love The Dark Side of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Obscured By Clouds, A Momentary Loss of Reason and Atom Heart Mother. Why they released such junk is beyond anyone's wildest dreams. This is one to avoid."
5,best overlooked Floyd album,"Cause you have to be trusted by the people that you lie to, so that when they turn their backs on you, you'll get the chance to put the knife in"
5,But who has the 8-track,"i am not going to review this, just read the next one to hear all of the acolades I would have said. This is for the collector. The 8-track version of ""Animals"" has ""Pigs on a wing Pt. III"" Basically it's a short drum solo by Nick Mason. I have never heard it, I only know it exists. Whether the 8-track is still out there at some flea market somewhere, I am not sure.Happy hunting. oh, and buy this if you don't already have it."
5,DOGS Enough said!,"Dogs is the greatest song ever made. David Gilmour is a brilliant guitarist. Pink Floyd is incredible, and DOGS is musical perfection."
5,This is the best floyd album,"Not too much Waters, (Final Cut), Not too much Gilmour (Momentry Lapse of Reason) - Perfect combination of scathing sarcasm and wonderful harmonius music. AWESOME"
1,A boot,"This is a bootleg album, not an official release. Made in an European country and sold here pretending to be the real thing. It has a bar code and everyting, these bootlegers just keep getting smarter, ha? DONT BUY THIS THING."
4,"Dogs is amazing, everything else is good","While this album is a very good album, it's no Wish You Were Here or Dark Side of the Moon. It opens and closes with a version of Pigs on the Wing (different start and end version), which are by far the weakest songs on the album.However, the other songs are all good, and Dogs is simply stunning, all 17 minutes. An attack on the rich and heartless businessmen, Dogs is one of Pink Floyd's top ten songs. Pigs (Three Different Ones) follows, and is disappointing only to the extent that it doesn't live up to Dogs. However, it is good musically, lyrically, and thematically. Sheep is much of the same story.This album is very good, even if not Pink Floyd's best. It is well worth the money, if only for Dogs."
5,The most listenable Pink Floyd,"So the lyrics are a bit nihilistic. After hundreds of listenings over the years that doesn't matter to me. This is the jazziest, most melodic, most even of all Pink Floyd albums. You put it on, you listen, you lose track of time. If only it were longer.And it's the only album I'm aware of that contains vocoded dog barks. (Perhaps you remember hearing Johnny Fever playing that passage on WKRP!)"
5,A somewhat overlooked masterpiece,"Because it essentially contains only three songs, ""Animals"" is not as popular as the other albums from Pink Floyd's heyday. But it is a classic almost on par with ""Dark Side of the Moon"" and ""The Wall."" The lengthy instrumentals are never boring and the dark, cynical lyrics by Roger Waters achieve a kind of demented poetry. Downcast music simply doesn't get any better than this."
5,"Before the dark times,BEFORE THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION!!!!","Man what can be said here that hasnt already been stated a thousand times about the Floyd....they have their own style of music... FLOYD MUSIC.Im not one oF those anal people who say the only good music was written in the past but nowadays their just isnt any real thought and creative energy out there making anything new unique and exciting,""at least not on this level"" and thats what makes listening to this one so sweet... I somtimes enjoy the taste of metal but latley I have been a floydarian. GO FLOYDARIAN!!!"
3,Disappointed,Not too sure who these remasters are aimed at. Is it for a new audience and more revenue or a real attempt to improve things? I am so disappointed with this version as the gutsiness and rawness of the original has now become what sounds like a radio one live lounge set
5,great pink floyd,"only pink floyd could makes dogs barking blend into beautiful music. depressed but thoughful. down i go with my brain on , and instantly relax. love this album."
4,A Special Album,"This is one of those albums that people don't understand. This is more a treatise of polictics and politicians and should be just experienced from start to finish without interruption. Like ""Dark Side"" it takes you somewhere, and makes you think. So just let it...."
4,Lesser known but an excellent album,"When you hear Floyd, people think of Dark Side or the Wall. I am expanding my floyd collection and I have stumbled onto a gem entitled ""Animals"". I have never heard any of these songs on the radio probably because each of them are very long 10 minutes plus. There are 5 songs on this CD and all of them are excellent. If you are a Floyd fan or just getting into their music this album honestly rates up there with dark side and the wall. The only downside is that there are basically 5 songs on the CD. Those 5 songs are great though."
5,Classic Part of any Pink Floyd Collection,I became introduced to this album long after I listened to The Wall. Up until then The Wall & the Dark Side of the Moon were the only Pink Floyd I owned or heard. A friend played this album in review for me and I had to have it as part of my collection. I do not believe you'll find any of the tracks on some sort of greatest hits cd. I would encourage a Pink Floyd collector to add this cd as it is definitely a classic!
5,my favorite,"this is my favorite of all the pink floyd albums. i dont really know for what particular reason i guess it just moves me the most. pigs is my favorite song on here but the whole album is very good and i love how each pink floyd album connects with itself throughout the whole thing, following the same plot sort of like a movie or a book. the music these guys put out is just fantastic. they can paint so many pictures in your head with their words and so many emotions in you're soul with their sound. quite a few have tried to emulate their sound but no psychadelic band will ever match the success of pink floyd. they mastered their genre, there's no doubt about that."
4,here piggy piggy,"From the classic Storm Thorgerson cover to the chilling images of isolation inside, it is apparent that Pink Floyd's ""Animals"" is no happy go lucky pop-album. Animals is probably the first sign of a Roger Waters dominated Floyd. His messages of isolation, fear, paranoia, are all in the forefront. This does not mean that Animals does not have its uplifting moments. The beautiful ""Pigs On The Wing"", David Gilmours soaring guitar work in ""Dogs"", it all makes for a wonderful, if unsettling listen. This is one of the best records of its time, and it will stand up to repeated listens. Get it. Live it. Love it."
4,Creepy,"Lyrically brilliant in concept. This album set a new standard for concept albums. It has some great music to match. I love that harmonica-type thing that Gilmor plays on Pigs (Three Different Kinds). People have told me it is very depressing, but I gain insight in it. I love this album!"
3,Animals,"This is a CD you would probably want in your collection if you are a big fan of Pink Floyd. Although non essential it is neither their best effort nor is it noteworthy for the time period. This album seems only a transition between their greatest efforts namely Wish You Were Here and The Wall. Best song on the album ""Sheep"", which is probably the most indicative of Pink's style and greatness. I always thought Waters and Gilmore were torn between the ""animals"" they perceived in society and in the vein of the classic 'Animal Farm'."
5,"this is about the music, not the politics","politically, Roger Waters is a total idiot, but as a musician, he's awesome....this album is simply about the best rock piece ever....I read this more about (despite whatever Waters' intentions) as commentary about Man, not capitalism....aftyer all, capitalism is NOT an ""ism"", it is what Man would naturally do without any State apparatus lording over it with the threat of force. a real treat, but not something for a party, or dancing....which is a good thing."
3,Not as good as The Wall or Dark Side of the Moon,"OK, so I'm no Floyd guru, but Wish You Were Here was superb, I fell in love with Dark Side of the Moon, and wanted The Wall to have my babies.Yet, Animals disappoints me musically. Forget the lyrics for a moment (I know, I know, that would be heresy, but humour me): somehow the sound just doesn't have the same depth. I played it three times before mournfully consigning it to the CD tower in the ""back bedroom"". The other three Floyd masterpieces remain in my car. If you've got other Floyd albums, or you want to read it like a book, or you prefer the acoustic to the electric guitar, well, maybe you should give it a try. But don't click on ""buy now"" if this is your first Floyd purchase."
1,Best of the Best,"Had to change my star rating becasue 1 star only had 7 and 2 star had 8 and I felt bad for 1 star but now I feel great. Like Dylans Street legal this gets last in more popular masterpieces, but this might be the best, I fyou dont buy it I'll let you eride my bike if you like- Its got a bell and some whistles- its so nice that I stole it.Out of the big 4 floyd cds- this is the only one I still listen to often, I cant deny the greatness of DSOTM,wish you were here or the wall, but over the years I ve heard them so often that they dont really spark any awe or wonder- although Ive heard animals as much it just seems like there still something mysterious about it I can still listen to it nad be amazed- I hope they put it out on SACD- but thats why I think its the best of P.F. I consider all 4 to be masterpieces not to be missed. Oh eye its great to here this Album almost total ly live on In the flesh- amen."
5,"this one i heite most, : animals","this is one I hate most, just like the wall animals is utter utter crap, such bad music and lame stuff it makes me puke in sheer hurrahy.Peter 'abdomen' Steffens"
4,VERY underated.,"I love this cd.Even though most peope never got it,I think it includes some of roger's most cynical lyrics and some very good playing by David Gilmour and netted 2 of my most favorite Floyd tracks; Dogs and Sheep."
5,GENIUS,"i'm pretty sure that my title pretty much wraps it up. Pink Floyd is one of the greatest bands ever assembled!this album is too often overlooked in the Pink Floyd discography because of the great success of Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall. But i definitely like this more than The Wall. It's a tie with Dark Side and Wish You Were Here for my favorite by Pink Floyd.Pigs on the Wing (parts 1 and 2) are nice little caps on the ends of this double ended roman candle of rock.Dogs is a 17 minute classic with great vocals by Roger and some great guitar work by Gilmour. the synthesizer sounds of dogs barking is chilling and amazing. it sounds sooooooooo good!Pigs (Three Different Ones) is awesome. ""ha, ha, charade you are"" what else can i say?Sheep is another epic symbolizes us regular Joes being the sheep who are prayed upon by the dogs and taken advantage of by the pigs. just awesome.BUY THIS ALBUM!! do Floyd a favor and give this album the recognition it deserves."
3,Please stop remastering well mixed music!,The original CD release still had somewhat of an analogue warmth (dare I say) vinyl quality to it. This has been stripped in it's over excessive digitalisation - far too much treble. Please stop this madness! I rate the album as a 4 otherwise. Thanks.
3,Even though I'm a Pink Floyd fan...,"I think this album might be one Pink Floyd's darkest eras. It doesn't have the originality of Pre-dark side material, Doesn't reach the Nirvana attained in ""Shine On You crazy diamond"", and doesn't have the force present in ""The Wall"", or ""Careful with that axe..."".It has three extremely long tracks along with two extremely short ones. Unfortunately, the long tracks rely way too much on special effects and sound engineering and little on the music itself. But there is some good material:-The two short tracks.-Small bits of good guitar in ""Dogs"".-The really really good opening in ""Sheep"". It is a pity that after such a good opening the song goes horribly weird and melody-less. Just straight heavy metal, something way below a true Pink Floyd's fan lofty standards."
3,And then Waters began to thought he was Floyd..,"Pink Floyd as a Water's backup band begins here. Wright's input was incredibly reduced. The overall concept is pretty good (orwellian's theme), but the music is not so good. Well, ""Dogs"" is excellent, ""Pigs"" is good, but ""Sheep"" is mediocre (it seems a precursor of rap for me). And ""Pigs on the Wing"" made me miss the acoustic songs presents in ""More"". Waters had excellent ideas, but he could share musical ideas with the rest of the band. Although he's a great lyricist and a good composer and vocalist, he's not Syd Barrett, the greatest all-time composer!"
3,Mediocre,"The members of Pink Floyd themselves have admitted throwing this album together in a very hasty fashion in order just to have some tour material. This, coupled with other things, is why I give this album only three stars.Pigs on the Wing parts I and II are both very good, short but sweet, songs. A better version of the two combined can be download from the various places on the internet.Dogs, Pigs (three different ones), and Sheep, the majority of the album, are all pretty much the same, which doesn't really present a problem if you like any one of the songs.Moderately reccommended."
2,In the minority,"I'm obviously in the minority here, but I found Animals to be a disappointment. Having just revisited this album I find it unimaginative, pretentious and self-indulgent. I mean, really, a 17 minute song? While I agree if any band could have pulled it off, Pink Ployd could, but they don't. If only wiser heads prevailed then more listenable music could have been created. Look at the diversity of The Dark Side of the Moon, not only their best album but one of the greatest rock albums ever. Animals pales by comparison. I'll give them points for audacity, but little else."
1,Pink Floyd made in Mexico?,"5 Star Album, 1 Star from where its made. I love the Floyd PERIOD! But as you said ""Digipak."" DigiPak Sucks.... Notice now that these are made in Mexico? Whats up with our recording companies outsourcing masterpieces in Mexico? What next China? I will tell you one thing, I will quit buying music if this crap doesn't stop @ once!"
1,Cute.,"Dogs, Pigs, Sheep? Cute. There is such a thing as taking a concept album too far and missing out on the main point, which is creating enjoyable music. If that appeals to you, buy Animals by Pink Floyd."
1,BLERC !!!!,"Excpet the masterpiece ""The Wall"", this so called ""masters of music"" never did anything real good at all. Their indulgent music, blended together with sounds and weird instruments, leads to nowhere, it has no punch, it has no real rock on it!! They're an experimental band and, like so manye experiences, a lot of them are merely blunders!"
5,Not so good as the previous albums,"DOGS is maybe the best PF song ever made, only comparable to ""Shine on you crazy diamond"" from Wish you were here. But the entire CD is not so... I would say... enjoyable as Wish you were here, Meddle, and of course, Dark side. Get these first."
5,brilliantly composed,pink floyd are geniuses. their ability to blend into a single sound of music rather than four separate musicians is breath-taking. Animals is one of the most clever of the concepts Pink Floyd have ever conceived. the music is border-line freak-out...the best kind
5,Good Album From A Great Band,"this is a great album all the key songs were mainly written by roger waters, pigs 3, dogs etc. anyways this is a great album its more heavy than most pink floyd albums also if you have never heard the song Raving And DRooling well it sounds exactly like the song dogs so yeah if you dont have access to this album download it or just buy it"
3,Not a Bad Bootleg,"As the previous commenters have stated, this copy is obviously a bootleg. However, considering that the two albums together come to over $27, and I got this for $9 (including shipping), the deal really isn't that bad, especially since the audio quality is decent. (Aside from volume issues, the overall quality seems as good as an original copy, although I don't consider myself to have a very discerning ear.) I guess it just reaffirms the old addage that you get what you pay for."
5,one of floyd's best,Animals is one of the best albums from Pink Floyd who were arguably the greatest rock band after Led Zeppelin.I would put this as third best after Wish you were here and THE WALL.
5,Never Get Tired Of It.,"Although not as famous as The Wall and Dark Side of The Moon, this is still a 5-Star Album. I had not listened to it in it's entirety since the vinyl record days. It was my first Kindle HD music purchase and I enjoyed it more than I did years ago. I recommend this for anyone who appreciates great musicians and song writing. If you enjoy Pink Floyd music add this Album to your MP3 player."
4,One of the most overlooked Floyd albums.,"Please not I am not under 13, and in fact am a person substantially older and literate in the English language, but do not feel the need to give my name.----------------------------------------------------------------Although Dark Side of the Moon and the Wall were Pink Floyd's greatest successes, they released about what seems to be 30 or so others. This album is rather long and progressive, but it has a great vibe to it. It starts and ends with an acoustic intro and outro, and inbetween has 3 songs focused on what groups people fall into; pigs, sheep, and dogs. The only main flaw with this album is the insufficient amount of vocals by David Gilmour."
3,Did Roger Waters really think that Animal Farm was about...,"...Capitalism? What a stupid thing to say. Everyone knows that Animal Farm was about the evils of Communism and Stalinism. That's why it was banned in the Soviet Union.""The pigs are self-righteous hypocrites inflicting their beliefs on everyone else""Sure sounds like liberals and just about the entire Democrat Party today doesn't it?"
2,ANIMAL MUSIC,I only like one song on this album: sheep. All the rest are just really not that good. I think this was an album to do good and in a way it did i suppose. I would have hated to be at the particular concert where Roger Waters spat on that young lad.All in all it is just another brick in the wall!
4,Pink Menagerie,"Out of all their work, this is probably the most ""typical"" Pink Floyd album. Unifying concept, smart lyrics, long songs, good instruments, interesting music, special effects. It works very well, although it lacks the impact of ""The Wall"" or the brilliance of ""Dark Side of the Moon."" Makes the cut."
5,"...a shelter, from Pigs on the wing.","If you like music that will haunt you for the rest of your life, get Animals, and listen to it alone or with a friend, all the way through. Any less is an injustice to the music, and to yourself. As with any classic, once you experience it you'll see the world in a new light.When I finally go over the edge, I'll be singing Animals, and I'm sure they'll lock me away for good."
5,let it never get popular,"Well whenever you hear a Floyd song you hear the same old, same old. For anyone who lives to listen to great music this is the album. It was the beginning of the end for pink floyd. Roger Waters was slowly taking over the band and Richard Wright didn't right any of the music (first album he didn't write on). Dave Gilmour's finest guitar to date, I don't think he will ever top it. Listen to the two octive solo's on Dogs. It will make your hairs on yoru neck stand. I have listened to maybe bootlegs of the different versions of these songs and man they hit them right in the studio. This album was the beginning of the end for a talanted rock band. I would suggest buying it, this is my favorite album in floyds second musical stage (the late 60's being there first stage). This album is better than Dark Side and will show you the power of this great band. Matt"
5,It is just a classic pink floyd album...its great,"it is an awesome album, and it's my favorite out of all of them. This CD has great music on it."
5,An underrated classic,Animals is a really fantastic album which is one of the albums from this great British rock band.This contains some of the finest rock songs in pigs and dogs.I have had this since the past 5 years and still enjoy it today as I did when I got then.Get this with their other albums.FIVE STARS.
5,Better than 'The Wall',"This album is, in my opinion, Pink Floyd's best. 'The Wall' gets all the talk, but 'Animals' has no weaknesses at all."
4,The Forgotten Album,"The Waters political view of modern mankind. There are some very good David Gilmour guitar solos, although, in a few parts, he get's apart of his melodic style."
5,Bleeding Into A Darker Tone,"Released in 1977, Animals caught the average Pink Floyd fan off guard. The cover alone demands attention. Considered by some to be a ""cult album"", Animals seems to be targeted for those who are more artistically inclined. You must use your ears and imagination more than your eyes. It's a concept album but Water's demands his listeners attention with his visceral attacks on society and polticians.Animals is an important bridging piece of art rock. It's is not necessarily a peak for Pink Floyd, but is not to be missed. Borrowing from the long pieces of it's predacessor, Animals is one of those quality over quantity albums. It's also a sign of what was to come with The Wall's poltical bitterness and psychedelic isolation.Animals is probably never going to be as highly sought after as cult pieces like Meddle because it lacks the pop-friendly formula. But as abstract as they are, even black sheep deserve appreciation."
5,Pink Floyd - Animals,"This Floyd album beats them all. It has the band playing at their best. Rogers Waters and Nicks Masons rythem pounding, Richard Writes keyboards are awsome and non other than David Gilmours guitars wail and flow fluently. Listen to how Rogers singing and Ricks keyboard combine together in SHEEP and Davids three guitar onslaught in PIGS(3 different ones). I like Dark Side as much as anyone but I also think it is over rated and Animals is way too under rated. I find putting on a good set of head phones and just absobing this album to be the best way of enjoing it. Do your self a favour and buy this C.D. today, you will not go wrong, promise!!!Krazeehoser"
4,blast from the past,"I heard this disc for the first time in twenty years on New Year's Eve. Had to have it again. Animals is a brilliant piece, but clearly marks the beginning of the end for Pink Floyd. What they built with Relics & Meddle & perfected with Dark Side & Wish You Were Here seemed to dimish slightly with Animals & even more so with The Wall as Waters took creative control of the band. The rest is history, (unfortunately) they couldn't ""tear down"" the ""wall"" that Roger built."
5,This is the best Pink Floyd album,"Its a great album. Their master concept album. Its their most underrated album though. Coming out after Darkside Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here, this album was different from those two albums. This album is very dark. The music on this album is beautiful and the guitar work is THE BEST DAVID GILMOUR has ever done. The lyrics are wonderful. All the elements came together on this masterpiece. If you're new to Pink Floyd I recommend ""Darkside Of The Moon"" before this album just to get you into them. But if you want to get more into them and hear their masterpiece buy this album today. You will not be let down."
5,I Never Forgot This Book,"I came across this book as a teenage girl, probably around the mid-70's. This ranks as one of my favorite books, along with only a few others. It made an impression and I have thought back to the book again and again, for many different reasons throughout the years. Being ageless as a woman was such a striking thought. Now that I've just turned 50, feeling nowhere near that age in terms of looks or outlook, I have been trying to hunt down a copy. I think it will be my Christmas present. I don't hang on to many material things, but this book will be with me the rest of my life. I hope to live a long one - most women in my family live on into their 90's - keeping their wit and smarts and beauty alive."
4,very interesting,I did not know what to expect from the title. The story was quite original which is always refreshing. An active imagination is definetly required to sustain this book. Some of its elements border on the fantastic which may not suit everyone. However I enjoyed it very much.
4,a treasure is hatched the subtleness unmatched,"She, however you look at it, is a dark and subtle book, that did what it was supposed to do. The reader can also be easily grasped by Ayesha's mysterious beauty--falling for her with lust while your feeble brain struggles to hold back. Yet--in a way the book's humor is nothing to be laughed at. It questions life in a subtle way. Still, the book is lacking in originality and family reality."
3,"Yeah, it's a classic, but it's also racist","Haggard was a great storyteller, and She is full of vivid images that stay with you. You can see his influence in C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, and even on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.But don't expect this book to be all good. Haggard's stereotypes about Africans are painful to read. Civilization, culture, and nobility are strictly the qualities of the ""white"" people; and the ""black"" people are cannibals, superstitious, and cowardly. In Haggard's story, even the mosquitoes won't bite Africans if there are white people around (apparently the insects are also racist -- they think white folks taste better).This is still an exciting story, and historically interesting for its popularity (written in 1887 and still published today), but the flaws are serious. I would recommend this book to my kids only if we could discuss it, and they were old enough to think critically about it."
1,Ridiculously Expensive,"You can buy this remote for $10 with free shipping on Bose's website.I'm sure the remote itself is great, just don't buy it here. This isn't amazon's pricing as far as I can tell either, this is the price set by this particular seller.Normally I'd support Amazon and it's sellers, but $40 is a ridiculous price."
3,Just a display peice,I thought I would be able to actually burn stuff in this mini stove but it is only built for display.
3,I Simply Forgot....,"....how much I actually liked this band musically, but how much the lead vox sucked. Almost makes me want to push the tracks into an in-home studio, and pull the vocals completely out -- then again, maybe that's what makes this unique and memorable, and why I pulled the trigger on purchasing this otherwise un-relevant (now and then)compilation of d**k-rock. ""BAAATS! B-A-T-S BOYYZ! AFTER TEENAGE S*X!""...you've gotta be kidding...."
3,Nice intro to revolutionary war era,"I bought this after seeing the A&E movie and I really enjoyed it. It's relatively short and easy to read since it focuses on character and personalities rather than dry facts. The narrative flows so well that you really feel as if you're there in the room or on the embankments with Washington, a young Hamilton, et al. Even though the book is listed as fiction, it appears to have been well researched and the book does contain notes and a bibliography. I was never interested in this period of US history before, but this piqued my interest and now I'm planning to read more ""scholarly"" works to get a more in-depth understanding of the era."
3,A little disappointed,"I read this based on the fact that I enjoyed the movie adaptation so much. The movie credits characterized it as ""a novel"", but if it is a novelized telling, I can't say that I cared for the almost complete ""third person"" way in which it was done. If Howard Fast could write such great dialogue for the screenplay, I'm not sure why he didn't do it for the book itself. I believe it would have had a more readable flow to it. It couldn't seem to decide if it was a novel or a factual narrative. His historical notes in the back were more interestingly told than the ""story"" itself. I may have thought better of it if I had read the book first, but after the screenplay, it was a disappointment."
2,"the crossing,by howard fast","having just viewed the a&e presentation on television,i was surprised to see general horatio gates present at the meeting or council of war that washington held at the merrick house. i can find no fact in actual histories that place gates at this meeting.since this is a novel perhaps the author is allowed some deviation from history."
3,"WHY FISKARS,WHY!!!","It seems fiskars has crossed over to the dark side. when i recieved my brush axe it had a stiker on the back of the sheath that said MADE IN CHINA. i couldn't find FINLAND anywhere on the product. WHY FISKARS,WHY!!! i was very irritated, becase the picture said FINLAND and my other fiskar tools were also made in FINLAND, so i was exspacting it to be made in FINLAND, NOT CHINA!So to see if it was still fiskars quality i took a walk into the woods and put it to the test. I hacked and slashed through a 3"" dried ceader,many grape vines rangeing from less than half an inch to 4"" and umpteen saplings. the brush axe passed,it's blade was still shape with no necks, and it wasn't rattling. it is still a good quality tool ,but i would of liked much more if it was made in finland."
3,good tool crap sheath,"I would rate this tool higher, but the ""sheath"" is garbage. Get the gerber one instead (it's actually made by fiskars) and you get a quality sheath with it as well."
2,Dangerous handle design,"I was using the tool to reduce some brush for the chipper. Due to the glass smooth handle design the axe slipped out of my gloved hand and smashed across my shin buying me a trip to the emergency room, 8 stitches, and a new pair of pants. On the plus side the blade was super sharp leaving a nice straight clean cut for the ER doc to stitch up. I have been using a cheap straight blade machete for 15 plus years and have never had problem. I will use the brush axe still, but only for limited applications."
2,Is Fiskars writing all of these reviews?,"I bought one of these based on all of the positive reviews, and it does not impress. First, it is poorly engineered--the blade extends into the handle only as far as the wide part of the black section, perhaps an inch. The rest of the handle is hollow. This is simply not how you make a tool, esp. a sharp one. It is obvious why some have reported the blade separating from the handle. Second, there is simply no edge on the blade as shipped.I sharpened it up a bit and attempted to use it on the ~1/4"" green, fibrous, canes of a multiflora rose bush. The canes bounced off the tool when I left them hanging loose. When I held the canes tight, the blade bounced off of them. It worked kind of OK in a few specific cases, but I have no need of yet another tool that I need to trade out in lots of situations. Sticking with the loppers and hand shears."
4,Should follow Fiskars Axes...,"Everything about it is great (I won't rehash other reviews here)...EXCEPT the edge. Maybe I'm just picky, but the edge it came with was beyond useless. Why can't it come with a nice SHARP edge like Fiskars axes do? After spending 20 minutes giving it a REAL sharpening, it's now working as it should."
1,Not product offered quality,"I bought the Brush AXE because I have more items from Fiskars and I'm happy with it, but if I check the product and it says made in Finland I don't like to receive and see that It has been maden in China, its a hugh difference since old experience I had. I only hope don't have problems with it.."
2,Fiskars 7860 Brush Axe,"I wanted to like it really badly. I Like the idea of it but after hitting a few small limbs on a Canadian Hemlock in 25 degree weather and doing some very light pruning the blade had not one chip but many chips. IF you want to get one as a ""throw away over time go for it"" I'll go back to using my Large Bowie Knife by KBAR with the 9""inch blade that is RAZOR sharp and has taken a beating battoning Oak Firewood and has not chipped. I have the Fiskars Splitting axe with 36"" handle and it is TOP OF THE LINE STATE OF THE ART and splits AMAZINGLY. This Brush Axe on the other hand was ""Garbage"" as the French would say LOL Again, if you want to beat it and chuck it buy it. If you are looking for a long lasting quality item do not. Also, it is not full tang meaning the blade ends where the plastic handle starts. NOT GOOD. (*"
4,I really using it,"Only used it one time so I cant vouch for its longevity,Nice size but I won't give 5 stars till it comes with a better scabbard and has proven it can hold up to repeated use."
2,"Good tool, but it IS breakable!","This was a great tool...until it broke and flew hundreds of feet into the woods. I used it to cut Asiatic Bittersweet and Porcelain Berry vines. It was great! It really did a nice job of cutting those vines. Good balance, sharp blade, quality shape to cut and pull vines away.One day, I was cutting vines and the blade broke right off the handle. It was bizarre because there were no prior signs of damage. There were no cracks and the blade did not feel loose. So for the love of Crumb Cake, be careful with this tool if you purchase one.I am happy to report that after I sent an email (including pictures of the broken tool) to Fiskars' consumer affairs department, they said they would forward the pictures to their quality control department. They were very helpful and quick to respond."
2,STOP!!! Look where it's made before you buy! makes ALL the difference!!!,"BEFORE you buy check where it is from!!! I have owned 2 of these. The first was made in FINLAND and was INDESTRUCTIBLE!!! It was drop forged and came with an edge that could shave the hair off your arm! Only reason I had to replace it was because it was ""lost"" (more likely stolen). New ones from Fiskars are made in CHINA out of weak stamped steel and better suited for spreading butter than cutting wood! I'm busy right now but am going to make a more complete review later. In short, FINLAND=AWESOME/BUY, CHINA=JUNK/DON'T BUY!"
3,Needs a better handle,"The Fiskar brush axe works quite well, but it's a scary tool. The handle is largely smooth plastic and doesn't provide what I would think of as a very comforting grip once your hand gets sweaty. I kept envisioning the tool slipping out of my hand and impacting my shin with that hook. Which would hurt. A lot. There's a hole for a wrist strap and I'd strongly suggest adding one. I'd also suggest avoiding vertical cutting and limiting cuts so that any follow through is away from the body. Common sense, when dealing with any kind of machete, I guess, but the forward protrusion of the hook means that this tool requires a higher level of situational awareness.Other than that, the hook end does grab the branches and the cutting edge makes them go away."
5,Great Collection!,The collection of poems is great. The book is very complete and organized in a easy to read format. I'm really glad I bought this book.
2,Outdated and innaccurate.,"This book is very outdated and not entirely accurate. It really contains only a fraction of the available Tolkien language material, and there are some languages that nobody even knew existed when this work was published.The chapters about Dwarven names and those of the Hobbits and Rohhirim are good, though. As for the rest of the book, if you want up to date, accurate info, I advise you to go to Helge Fauskanger's excellent web-page, Ardalmbion [online] the biggest and best resource on the net or in print."
2,There's better books for both topics this book covers,"It's a pretty good dictionary if you want to find out what somthing is in the lord of the rings books or somthing similar, but if you want to find out about the language and how to write it or speak it, you might as well pick up the Return of The King Appendix E and look at that. If you want to know good info about the language, search the internet. A good middle earth dictionary is the Complete Guide to middle Earth by Robert Foster. All in All, this is not a very good book."
1,Confused author,"The author gets confused by the difference between Sindarin and Quenya languages, and worse yet, messes up the Tengwar and its meanings. As a very broad overview, its OK. But for accuracy, I would give this book a big miss. The author did not do her homework."
3,Good for Novice Elves,"This book is great for people who already know the basics of Elvish and want to improve (or complicate) their studies. It includes all languages of Middle-Earth, a small Elvish dictionary, the Elvish alphabet, and tips on its useage. For beginners, I recommend visiting a less complicated Elvish website and buy this book if you want to know more about Middle Earth and its languages and cultures."
5,introduction to Elvish,"I liked this book. As a newcomer to Elvish and the Middle Earth languages, I found this boook to be very helpful and informative. It has extensive dictionaries and studies of the languages of the Hobbits, Rohirrim, and Rhovannion. I especially liked the chapter ""Using Elvish."" The author admits that these rules are ascertained from the various texts and are not necessarily exact. What I wanted was not just a listing of Elvish words, but to know how to write in Elvish myself. This chapter sets you in that direction.As a novice to Tolkein and Elvish, I can't vouch for the timeliness of the work, but it addressed what I was looking for. I'd recommend it."
2,Languages of Tolkien's Middle-Earth,"This author tried, but I'm afraid the book is now somewhat obsolete with the publication of new linguistic information in Christopher Tolkien's editions.I faithfully copied down the tengwar (in my rather bad handwriting) and the Quenya conjugations, though I have no conception if the latter are really right. I noticed that mutation (the change of an initial letter, as Balrog -- i Malrog) isn't ever mentioned, that I could find. In addition, of Elvish languages, only Quenya and Sindarin really get mentioned -- again, some of the more obscure languages were unknown to the public until the History of Middle-Earth was published. Interesting issues, such as the existence of Exilic Noldorin (I'm a believer in this!) weren't available yet for the author to discuss.I was interested to find that the language of Rohan is really Anglo-Saxon letter for letter.Because it's dated, this is hard to recommend, though one has to appreciate the work the author did."
4,O.K...,"I think this is a goood book to referance to, but don't plan on learning it if you don't know anything yet. It is better to learn online or from a friend the basics, then use this book to keep going back to or to develop yur skills. Ovrall I think it was pretty helpful."
5,2 thumbs way way up!,The languages of Tolkien's Middle Earth is a great book. I was particularly impressed with the Elvish to English and English to Elvish dictionaries. It tells a lot about Tolkien and the early formations of his ideas. It's a worthwhile book.
4,Quiet PSU.,This psu is quiet. The lengths of the wires suit the Antec P180B well as I have no trouble routing the wires into the lower and upper compartments and connecting the wires to the motherboard and drives. Only the wires powering the cpu and motherboard are sleeved though.
5,Simply excellent,"Exactly what you're looking for in a power supply. I have it paired with a Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3L motherboard, an Intel E8400 cpu, one HDD, one DVD-ROM and a nvidia 8600GT video card. Quiet, stable and power to spare."
5,A must have!,"This book is awesome for patent drafters. It's clear, concise and has EVERYTHING you need to know. Fantastic desk reference!"
2,Great movie until ...,"*SPOILERS*Because parents need to know these things, I must address this. This movie's description makes it sound like ""Andre"" or some other cute movie about a wild animal taken in by a family. Well, it is ... right up until the point where - out of the clear blue sky - the cute little otter is bludgeoned to death.Parents of small children MUST know these things going in or they will have some seriously messed up kids. My wife watched it alone first and it traumatized HER! She's still angry that I even brought it in the house. I may not have if I'd had some warning on the video cover but it only talks about fun, mischief and frolic, not violence, tragedy and grief. Those subjects are legitimate topics for films but there should be some kind of heads-up.The quality of the film isn't the problem, nor is the unflinching realism of it. It's the misleading advertising."
5,Most Perfect Pet,"I've seen this movie many,many years ago.Midge is an otter with a great fun loving personality.Most of the movie is a joy to watch as we see the antics of Midge and the love of the guy who owns her.After seeing this film,I became enamored with otters. They seemed altogether so enjoyable and lovable. After seeing this movie, I've never forgotten it. I sort of fell in love with the otter.If you have seen it, I recommend another viewing. If you haven't seen it,you must!No matter how old the movie is, it's timeless.Yes the end is sad, but it's life and reality and you'll gain an admiration for otters and all wild creatures that will really move you to tears.Have you seen the famous ""Otters Holding Hands"" clip? If not you may really choose it as a youtube favorite.It's a movie reminiscent of ""Born Free"" and if you liked ""Born Free"", you'll also treasure this."
1,Terrible.,"Some of the other reviewers here are right about this movie being the subject of a horribly misleading marketing campaign. Even right here on Amazon's site it says, ""an ideal world of simple happiness""--yeah, until the star of the movie gets his head bashed in.I don't see how anyone can describe this film as 'wonderful family entertainment' in light of the string of stories of traumatized children crying themselves to sleep. The message left by the film is not uplifting in any way, it just says that despite your best efforts your world can come crashing down at any moment.Stay far away from this one."
5,Ring of Bright Water,"This is a lovely film based on a true story of an otter adopted by an writer, who wrote a book about his adventures with his pet otter. After bringing him home to his apartment in London, he soon found it would be necessary to find a new place to live, and he decided on a cottage in a remote countryside off the coast of Scotland. Very entertaining and charming."
2,Good start but the ending ruined it,"This is not a good movie for children, though you won't know this until the end of the movie, when the otter is cruelly and senselessly killed. My 11 year old son cried himself to sleep.The scenary is beautiful and for the most part, so is the story. It is too bad that the ending was not better considered, instead it comes out of nowhere."
3,Traumatic childhood memory,"I was just 5 when I saw ""Ring of Bright Water"" and it was a great movie about a man's friendship with a playful little otter up until the end. I will never forget how upset I was when the poor otter gets killed at the end. I don't remember the details but I do remember sobbing for hours. My parents kept explaining the otter in the movie was an ""actor"" for days afterwards, but it did not help!! I don't think little kids should see this film. It's very upsetting."
1,The MURDER of an Innocent Animal is not for Children EVER !,"Bright Marketing BS- Scarred me as a child.. and to this days the memory lingers. Who knew what was coming and WHY ???????? This did not occur in the book, clubbing an Otter to death, ain't we got fun..."
4,Pat,"Oops, looked up used books, so when I rec'd it it was a DVD and I was surprised. The DVD is good, but I really wanted the book. The movie leaves out lots of parts. I'll order the book later"
1,The movie we laugh about because it's so bad,"My daughter and I watched this movie when she was 12. We found it incredibly boring, with nutty clarinet music that drove us up a wall. It went on.... and ON...... AND ON...... and then the otter died. We had been waiting for the movie to pick up, and then it was suddenly over. Four years later, all we have to do is say 'otter' or imitate the clarinet music and we're laughing again.See it if you're in a weird mood. Don't watch it with young children!"
1,Not a light movie - be prepared to have your kid cry...,"My grandmother took me to see it and when the Otter died, I started bawling like crazy and we had to leave the theater. Never watched it since nor do I plan to!!! - I know kids need to learn about stuff like this, but at least warn the viewers about it first!!!"
5,GET THIS CD OR SEE THEM CONCERT !!!!,This cd is just great !!! I could go on and on. Ive seen them numerous times in concert and they are always great. On this cd Running out of time really rocks !!!! Get this one !!
3,Music fan,The older import versions of these shows in Boston are much better in selection of song versions. Look for the old imports if you want a good idea of the band's power at that time.
2,Bronze Worker,"I purchased this even with some marginal reviews because of the Delta name. I owned Delta woodworking equipment in the past and found it to be of good quality. However this product is a major disappointment. It arrived with the stem of the light switch broken, and the wheel attachment nut rubbing on the housing. I have to completely disassemble it to correct the problem. I guess that's the quality of ""Made in China"". After using it for a month the on/off switch jams. I called and wrote Delta for some replacement parts. So far no reply. It seems that they are improving shareholder value at the cost of customers. No more Delta iron for me."
1,Kander & Ebb & Minnelli in far from top form,"THE ACT was a mess on stage. The book was incoherent, and the score by Kander and Ebb was nowhere near the level of their earlier shows like CABARET and CHICAGO. Fortunately they had a star who could sell tickets even with inferior material. Liza does indeed sell every number but apart from ""The Money Tree"" and ""City Lights"" there is nothing for her to work with.DRG's cast album tries hard to hide the fact that this was a Broadway show at all: There is no synopsis or background information on the musical. It's troubled road to Broadway could make a novel with all the backstage battles, changes of directors and changes of title. Once it opened to less than glowing reviews and Miss Minnelli began missing performances it slowly ground to a halt after 8 months. It is a show that will never be revived and one that all the participants feel would be best forgotten."
4,A little too Kander and Ebb...,"A little too much of their uptempo songs and not enough ballads for the incredible Minelli, the ACT is a good album to listen to while exercising, dancing, working, cleaning, etc. It'll keep you jumpin'."
4,I SAW THIS SHOW IN 1978,"My first Broadway musical, all the way from Virginia to see this ultimate diva. Cast album is a pretty good approximation of the performance, though I don't like a few of the arrangements and some of the chorus' voices. ""City Lights"" is great, as is ""Bobo's"" and the fantastic ""Money Tree"", which brought the house down as the first act closer. Glad to see this is readily available again."
5,Liza's Best Broadway Score!!!!,"Back in 1977, I attended three performances of The Act, and each time Liza was super collossal!! She WAS the show, and she was onstage most of the time. I rememeber fans asking when the score would be recorded. I even wrote her myself and received a personal reply from Liza saying it would be done soon. It turned out to be a wonderful package, great vocals and cover photo that is quintensential Liza! City Lights is a favorite of mine. Liza won her third Tony Award for this show. The transfer to CD is faithfully captured. Many budget CD's from Europe have released this score on various labels. A must have for Liza fan!!!"
4,A walk back to the '80s,"If the '80s was the decade of the one-hit wonders, then the duo of Bourgeois Tagg was the shining example (for the song ""I don't Mind at All""). Every once in a while you will here the song on a background music track in a store or restaurant and, if you are a child of the '80s, you probably say to yourself ""I've heard that before,"" but can't remember who it was. Well it's Bourgeois Tagg. This song takes me back to a simpler time of OP board shorts, upturned collars on Izod polo shirts and Vans skate shoes.However, it shouldn't just end with one song. Brent Bourgeois and Larry Tagg had very thought provoking lyrics and solid music to back them up. While ""I Don't Mind at All"" is clearly their most known song, two others are quite noticeable: ""Waiting for the Worm to Turn,"" (which has an acoustic, upbeat feel) and ""Pencil and Paper,"" (more intense and danceable).If you are into rare '80s music, then Yoyo is a must."
4,Almost Made It,"I was pleased to find this CD to replace my original (now stolen) copy. This was mid eighties in every respect and Bourgeois Tagg almost made it. This is their 2nd and last CD. They dotted all the i's, with management by Bill Graham, production by Todd Rundgren, and even an appearance on the Tonight Show (while Johnny Carson was still there). But, despite a modest hit with the heartbreaking ""I Don't Mind At All,"" the band broke up, for personal reasons.Brent left us some worthwhile songs, vocals and keys; Larry laid down a rockin' bass; Lyle's guitar is exactly right; and Mike, with Larry's bass, gives the whole thing a solid rhythm on the drums.In sum, it's a worthwhile memory."
1,"One hit wonders, and deservedly so","I was completely blown away the first time I heard ""I Don't Mind"", and decades later I still love the song. I owned this album first time around, having run out to buy it as soon as I heard the single. Sadly, it was a huge disappointment. Nothing else on the album comes even remotely close to the beauty and pathos of that song. In fact, with the possible exceptions of ""Waiting for the Worm to Turn"" and ""Coma"" (the other track to feature the string quartet heard so prominently in ""I Don't Mind""), nothing else was even close to listenable for me.Your mileage may vary, of course, but I strongly encourage potential buyers to listen to the online samples rather than assuming that the album's other nine tracks will compare to its one big hit."
4,Good intro to programming book,"I recently bought this book while looking for books for my younger brother to learn programming with. I bought this book as a bridge between him knowing nothing and him starting in on ""Thinking in Java"" by Eckel. It is aimed towards someone new to programming who needs to get basic concepts common to any language (loops, I/O, variables, breaking a problem into pieces, etc.) and covers up throught the beginnings of O.O. It is a well thought out book and has exercises that range from relatively easy to challenging. It will be most helpful (like any intro book) combined with an experienced programmer to ask questions of. This book will not teach you all of the cool new features of Java, but if you have little to no prior programming experience, this will help you."
4,Insightful & funny exercises,"It is an interesting book to read and the examples, exercises make it lots of fun. Quite readable all through."
4,"Live or not, a very good album","Another reviewer has said this ""live"" album was actually recorded in a studio, with audience noise added later. If so, it had me fooled. Based on the '87 Cropredy live songs on the ""It All Comes 'Round Again"" video, this is a good representation of how Fairport sounded live at the time. At latest count, I have 7 live versions of ""Matty Groves"" and this is easily the best, with a revised arrangement that suggests the violence of the lyrics. After Fairport reunited in the mid-80s, Simon Nicol was the only lead singer for a decade -- this album captures his odd re-birth as a romantic ballad singer, with ""Close to the Wind"" and the lovely ""The Hiring Fair."" There are also strong versions of old Fairport songs ""Crazy Man Michael"" and ""The Widow of Westmorland's Daughter"". The album ends with an unnecessary studio remake of ""Meet on the Ledge.""(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
4,Misconception,"There is a common misconception regarding this album. That is that it wasn't actually recorded live. It was live but some parts were re-recorded in the studio. Mostly what was fixed were things like not being close enough to the mic for the vocals to be picked up, etc. There is nothing wrong with the remake of Meet on the Ledge but it seems a bit unnecessary. If you can find the 12"" single version of it , it has an extra live song not on the album, although it should have been. If you want a live album that isn't actually live check out the Black sabbath live where they started fixing parts until there was nothing left of the live album but the applase"
2,"Nice songs, horrible mix","I really enjoy the modern approach to antique sounding British folk music represented by this album. The musicianship seems high but for one problem. The vocals are distant, often muddled and indistinct, and the vocalist is fairly lackluster. He is no Richard Thompson, (band member from a long time ago) that's for sure. If it's true that this is an artifically ""lived"" version of studio recordings, as is rumored in another review - well you think they could have gotten the mix right. I can't imagine a band allowing this to happen, what a bizarre idea. Good band, lousy album. However the songs Hiring Fair and Close to the Wind are worth having - maybe they exist elsewhere in better recorded sound."
3,This book was just ok.,This book was just alright. I have read other similar books about the Cultural Revolution that I liked more. I just didn't enjoy the writing style of this book.
3,Nice little book.,"This is a very quick easy read about two friends who have been sent to the countryside for re-education during China's Cultural Revolution. It's a nice little book with sparse storytelling - but it won't bowl you over. There is too little character development and not enough substance. The ending, too, is very different.However, it is a sweet little story which I did enjoy."
2,Kinda pointless,"Maybe this is just one of those books i just don't get, but I've read far more interesting and moving tales from the Chinese Communist era. The Laughing Sutra, for one."
2,Eh...,"I suppose I would give it a 2.5 if I could. It was moody and descriptive but...well, not much else. I didn't feel invested in the characters, so I was just sort of along for the ride. Didn't help that there were far too many bugs!! lol I wanted to like it since I have read other books with similar settings that I loved, but this was just so so..."
4,This one sneaks up on you,"For the first 50 pages or so, I thought this book was fine: not overly exciting, but not awful. It was slow and subtle, and it wasn't until more that 100 pages in that I suddenly realized that I actually really liked this book. The storyteller is very patient; he doesn't rush the storyline, doesn't beat the reader over the head with anything. He just let this tale unfold at its own pace, and in the end, I really appreciated that. I often forgot that this story was taking place not too long ago, since it reads like a nineteenth century novel at times. When I first sat down to read this book, I was afraid that it would read like another book that attempted to show the influence of Western literature in other cultures -- Reading Lolita in Tehran. I despised that book, but this one worked for me. I can't say exactly why this one was more successful, but it was. I guess it's best not to overanalyze some things -- just sit back with a cup of coffee, and enjoy."
4,A Classic!,"What a great story. I'm sure by now you've read what this story is about, so I'll just give my two cents. This is a great quick book that easily sucks you into the the story line. I loved all the characters these boys would meet. I loved the references to the books these boys read. Especially, because the stories were familiar! I was thrilled to have found this and can't wait to read Dai Sijie's most recent novel. I would also recommend ""Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"" if you enjoyed this book."
2,Not a Novel Novel.,"I really wanted to like this book. To my surprise it took me three attempts to finish, I was that bored. I tried to give it yet another chance by listening to the audio version, but the result was sadly the same: I found little in terms of the characters, their shared experiences during China's cultural revolution and the author's message on the transcendent power of literature that was new or refreshing."
2,Didn't find the charm,"I honestly wanted to be charmed by this book, but I found the story pedestrian and the characters only mildly interesting."
2,Not enough substance,"The author is a wonderful writer but I found the story itself weak. I liked the idea behind the plot, (anything to do with books), but it could have been developed better. It almost feels as though the writer wanted a novelette instead of a full-fledged novel.I came away feeling like the story was somewhat watered down.Don"
3,Simple Read with lack luster ending,"Dai's writing style and development of characters is good in addressing the conditions of re-education, however he rushes through the ending, leaving one to feel mixed about the entire book. The reader can identify with the Luo, the Little Seamstress, and the narrator, however feel no closure. Granted, literature should make you think, but this made me indifferent to the characters. I was asking myself, ""That's it?"" And not really wanting to contemplate the characters any further."
4,An Opinion from MERCY HIGH SCHOOL,"Dai Sijie used descriptive language and a fascinating historical backdrop when creating this novel. The main characters are interesting and well developed, and the reader is drawn into their daily adventures and struggles on Phoenix Mountain.I thought that the author's choice of time period, during China's Cultural Revolution, was very unique. The fact that he also had the opportunity to incorporate his own experiences of re-education in the story made it all the more appealing to me.However, I thought that the ending seemed abrupt, as though Dai Sijie had simply gotten sick of writing and wanted to end the story. He left too many questions about the futures of the characters unanswered.On whole, Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress is a great story and I highly recommend it."
4,Just like watching Chinese cinema,"In a series of little scenes, Dai Sijie presents you with jigsaw puzzle-like pieces that suddenly, in the final chapters, merge into a great picture. Western readers used to a more linear plotline might fumble during the first few chapters, but just let the scenes wash over you and you will find yourself carried to a clever, ironic and satisfying ending. Anyone with an ounce of Chinese history under their belt will appreciate this wry look at China's cultural revolution in action. A quick read - well worth the short investment of time."
3,"A Bit Overrated, I'm Afraid","I bought a used copy of this book from a local library because I had heard good things about it. I must confess, I was very drawn to the cover art. It looked like a fast read yet sounded very interesting. However, just because something says ""National Bestseller"" on the cover, doesn't mean it's terrific or deserving.The book was good enough to finish, but in the words of another reviewer, ""it was all very pedestrian."" Somehow I got the feeling that this book was a small, incomplete part of a larger story. There wasn't enough character build-up...nothing that really makes you care for, or even hate the characters...and that is the book's lethal flaw.It is short, but too safe, nothing stands out as remarkable. As an avid reader, I really look for the books that reach out and grab me, forcing me to remember them. I give this book a B-. It was decent, but decent is average (at best) in the world of books."
3,Worth reading...,"It took a little time for me to warm up to this novel but I'm glad I did. Like many authors, whose first language is not English, Dai Sijie wrote in very simple and direct language that appealed to me. Luo and his friend are sent to a village for re-education where they meet the seamstress. They think she is perfection except she is not as educated as they so the embark on a journey to educate her with a stolen bag of books. The irony of the story is only seen at the end when she leaves her village in order to go to the city, leaving behind her aged father and both the boys."
4,A Sweet Chocolate,"This story is a sweet piece of candy. A trifle that creates a moment of pleasure and is gone. It gives you a taste of the horrific Cultural Revolution in China in the late `60s and `70s. Two city boys are sent to a mountain village to be educated, and there, amidst many hardships, they find two treasures: some books that are literary classics, and a beautiful young seamstress.The books enrich their deprived world, and in reading them to the seamstress they develop a close relationship with her. Unfortunately the books also help bring about a personal disaster for them.The novel provides a fascinating look at life in rural China, and also tells us that Chairman Mao's power reaches deep into the most remote villages.It's a fluffy little short novel that tells an essentially humorous story taking place during a dreadful time. You can read it in just a few hours."
3,good but not great,"I had to read this for my book group and seemed to be one of the only girls who came away disappointed. It was certainly an quick,easy read but I was hoping it would be more along the lines of other 'modern fables' I love ( Silk, Perfume...) and I just couldnt see how it had received millions of glowing reviews. I have also done a lot of reading regarding the cultural revolution and felt that quite frankly the boys in this tale had a pretty easy time of it. Some of the imagery was lovely ie. swimming in the rock pool and as it is being made into a movie I can image the cinematography will be gorgeous but otherwise pretty forgettable."
4,An understated delight,"This is a gentle, delicate book that is written in a seemingly simple style but has unexpected depth to it. I was enchanted by the stories and characters Sijie presents -- the images of the two protagonists watching a film in order to retell the story to their villagers; of making their way down a trecherous path to share a book with the little seamstress; the old man sucking his ""jade oysters""; and the headman announcing the time on the new watch. Each episode is a gem!"
5,Simply powerful,"This story of two young men who are banished to rural China because their parents are seen as enemies of the state is very simply told, yet conveys the enormity of the supression of the Cultural Revolution. I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time.About two-thirds of the way through the book, there is an update in which three of the characters tell their own stories--then switching back to the story as it was being related. I did not object to this change of pace, but it was different."
3,Young Adult fiction,"The good news about this YA novel was the immersion into Mao period culture and the revelation (if you didn't already know it) of the cultural suppression imposed at that time.Also, the book was beautifully crafted writing and in that sense a joy to read. That said, the plot line wandered a bit and had very little tension considering the milieu in which it was set. It was not even close to a page turner, although it was interesting primarily because of the setting.As a character driven novel, IMHO, it falls into a more literary category."
5,Short and sweet,"A charming tale. After the first chapter, I knew it was going to be a good read, and I was not disappointed. I loved the humorous and touching (but not sappy) storytelling - it definitely took me to a different time and place the couple of hours it took to read the book. Though the author did not go too deeply into the characters' lives outside of the setting of the story (the villages of Phoenix mountain in Mao Zedong's China) he did offer a colorful and vivid look into an exciting and life-changing time in their lives. I highly recommend this enjoyable book if you are looking for a quick paced, lighthearted and entertaining story. This one is a gem!"
4,A Wonderful Fable,"Balzac the the Little Chinese Seamstress is a wonderful little fable about the transforming power of literature. Two young Chinese boys are sent to isolated mountain village for re-education during the Cultural Revolution. The only remnant of art they bring with them is a violin. They soon discover, however, a hidden treasure of banned Western classics, and that changes everything. Their lives, and that of the young woman they both love, the seamstress, are transformed with some alternatingly bittersweet and comic outcomes. This is a sweet, simple novel. Enjoy."
2,Expecting More,"I'm not sure what I was expecting from this book, and to be honest, I'm not sure IT knew what it was supposed to be. Coming of age story? Romance? Political or social commentary? Historical fiction? It was all of those, but just enough to get you intrigued, and then the author would jump ship and move onto something else. There really was no fluid storyline that felt cohesive here, so I can't say I really enjoyed it. The setting and plot were there, but just not as well-developed as I would have liked. I knew what the author was going for, but it just didn't get there for me.Wish I would have liked it more, as it's been on my ""to read"" list for a long time."
3,Left me feeling empty ...,"I felt this novel was quite a bit over-rated. Although the concept is interesting and different (i.e., the re-education of the city academic boys in Mao Zedung's communist regime), the story was a bit flat. I have a feeling something must have been lost in the translation. Despite being so short, I had to force myself to get back into this novel. I guess I just found it mediocre, a bit boring and really, nothing special. There was nothing awful about it; but nothing great either."
4,"Pleasurable, yet melancholy read","It took me only a few hours to finish Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress. It was enjoyable, but I found that a slight melancholy settled over me after completing the book. What I liked was that the main characters were thoroughly human. At first, their resigned acceptance of their ""re-education"" was hard to comprehend. However, detailed (but not tedious) descriptions show that the despair of their situation is in stark contrast to the human spirit that still burned within the two boys. My favorite scene on this count was when they acted as a dentist to the overbearing village leader. My only complaint is that some of the symbolism was a bit much. What was it with that raven, anyway? Overall, however, this was an enjoyable book and I recommend reading it."
4,Literature and life,"The characters in this little book are ripped from their families and their familiar environment. In this situation, fine literature becomes their guide. The characters seem realistic about their current situations. Balzac and Dumas are the only available sources of information about other cultures. Due to their youth and lack of other reliable guidance, it is doubtful whether they were able to process that information appropriately in order to be realistic about their future choices and hopes."
3,Didn't love it; didn't hate it,"This is one of those books that left me at the end thinking, ""That's it?"" I won't say it was a waste of my time, however. I found the descriptions, while often grotesque, to be very vivid. They placed me at the scene of the events. I didn't care much about the characters, though. I really didn't feel like I knew them at all. As I said in the title, I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either."
4,Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress,This was a very interesting book for our book club. There was a lot to discuss. We especially were interested in the dynamics of the relationships of the varied characters in the book.
3,A sweet fable,"I wish Amazon had half-star ratings because truly this is more a two and a half star book. It's a sweet little story, cliched in some parts, charming in others. The writing is not particularly great, but it's hard to tell in a translation. I am always a sucker for books about the human need for story-telling, and this short fairy-tale is a good (though not great) one."
4,Intro to the Cultural Revolution 101,"This charming book provides an interesting glimpse into China's cultural revolution, told from the perspective of a book-loving child of an intellectual who was shipped off to a remote farming community for ""reeducation."" It is difficult to imagine a world in which books are contraband and deemed to be detrimental to one's education, but that was how Mao ran the country. This book is short, poignant, and leaves one with a lingering aftertaste."
2,Unexpected Ending,"Bought the book purely for asthetic reasons. Such a pretty little book. Sorry to say, expected the read to be a bit better. The ending threw me and wasn't as I'd hoped. I guess it's true that reading (as education) can change a person - but not always in the way we would hope. Somehow, I am much disappointed in the Little Chinese Seamstress. In my mind, it isn't all about looks and beauty you see...... Fill me in readers, is there something I am missing here???????"
3,Interesting but boring.,"Maybe something was lost in translation??? Maybe I am not a deep enough thinker to have truly enjoyed this novel. One thing it did for me was to pique my interest in reading Balzac, Dumas, Kipling, Dickens, etc."
2,not satisfying,"I am reading it for school, and was ready to accept the book with open arms. Unfortunately, it is terrrrrible. I found it totally uninteresting. Sorry guys:("
4,i liked it..but the ending made me mad,i'm always interested in anything doing with the chinese cultural revolution. so this was right up my ally! short and sweet and interesting look on how much influence literature can have on people!
4,Sweet and simple,"This is a very nicely written little book, with beautiful imagery, recalling a time in Chinese history that was full of fear and paranoia. This novel, telling the story of two teenage Beijing boys who are shipped to the provinces for re-education, focuses on the beauty and simplicity of life. A coming-of-age novel -- but not too deep and a little allegorical-- it is a pleasure to read."
4,Book on Reading Lis,This book was on the reading list for school. Great book and my son enjoyed reading it. Received it good time and he was able to read it and get the work he need done on time.
2,No good ending,"I liked it. But, then the ending messed it up. It has some vulgarity that wasn't really necessary. And, the end just didn't fit with the rest of the book."
4,Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress,"I liked this book because it teaches a lot about Chinese history, and I have learned a lot from it, like about Mao's strict and harsh laws. This book kept me interested and kept me reading. But there's one bad thing about the book: the main character doesn't have a name. The book doesn't say his name. But still, I learned a lot of Chinese history from it and I will recommend this book to other people."
3,A Simple Story for a Complex Time,"This book is a short, meditative slice of the Cultural Revolution, presenting a rather ""simple"" story about a very tumultuous, complicated time in modern Chinese history.The novel follows the lives of two bourgeois and urban young men as they are ""re-educated"" in rural China. In between working like dogs (e.g., mining, farming, and even transporting animal and human excrement), they pass the time by escaping from their temporary, perhaps interminable, lives as peasants. They escape through the pages of forbidden Western novels and through their relationships (one romantic, one maybe more than platonic) with the pretty seamstress from a nearby village.Kudos to the author for not concoting a predictable love-triangle conflict for the three main characters, and for leaving the ending ambiguous. He uses evocative and spare prose throughout this beautiful novel. An enjoyable, refreshing little book."
4,Interesting book about reading books,"If you like books and you believe that that reading can transform your life, then you'll be able to identify with many parts of this book.The book is set during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and focuses on the lives of two teenage boys who have been sent to the rural area for ""re-education"" as part of the bourgeois class. Their lives are changed there in part through their interactions with the local villagers, and the banned books they manage to access. This is a short book, and was an enjoyable quick read, although parts of the ending still mystify me.This is another good book club read- there are a number of interesting ideas about the impact of literature on human lives."
5,A PERFECT book,"Dai Sijie's magnificent novel about the Chinese Cultural Revolution, is perfect. I started out reading this book with no clue what so ever of what the Cultural Revolution was. After the first few chapters I knew enough to get me through the rest of the book. After reading the book a second time, I have truly picked up the magic in it.Dai Sijie tells about two teenage boys, never experiencing great literature, then suddenly finding a suitcase full of western and European books. Reading them they fall in love with the authors and characters, then set about trying to make a mountain girl into a sophisticated city girl. The ending is miraculous, and is in itself just like one of the movies that Luo retells.I reccomend this book to everyone I know."
3,Hogan is a Legend,This film of great to see for those who remember The Great Ben Hogan.Anyone who knew him knows that his achievements came from his dilligent attention to detail and his endless hours devoted to practice. There are no short cuts in this game.
2,Most of these are on YouTube,"But if you have not looked it would be a good buy. Mostly practice swings, thought there would be more on course."
3,Excellent Video; Commentator Not So Good,The video's of Hogan's swings are priceless. The full speed swings at the beginning are what make it worth while. Far too many stop action swings and the commentary is of very little value. Playing it with the sound off is much preferred.
5,Classic,"A close analysis of these films proved without a doubt what John Schlee taught me to be Ben Hogan's secret was indeed the real deal. I can see it as plain as the nose on my face. My own DVD ""On Target Power"" and my book, ""The Secret to a Great Golf Swing"" reveal just what Hogan did to be the greatest ball striker.Mike Cortson"
1,On line Scrabble,"It was only good for earlier versions of Windows. Had to be careful to read small print. Not forgiving on this issue. My last product was easy. I just loaded into the machine, no numbers required. It cost more to ship it back. Who would have thunk it was for an early version. I threw it out I am disappointed that i was not more careful, and they would not send me a better version, but sheese, Windows 98!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!,"As a stand-alone game for one player, Scrabble *ONLINE* (!!!) looks great and works well. The mini-games are fun too. This is not a bad game at all.If you want to play Scrabble *ONLINE* (!!!!) with friends or family, especially those overseas who miss playing the greatest wordgame of all time with their loved ones, then I highly recommend you LOOK ELSEWHERE!!This game is garbage. With a clean install of Windows and Scrabble *ONLINE* (@#*&#@@!!), my online game with Gamespy crashed or was so slow as to prove unusable (the mouse hardly moved... very frustrating). I did my research and read the README file. I took down my firewall; in Windows XP this is relatively easy, so no problem. Then I downloaded a ""retail patch"" from the atarisupport website. After all that, the game is STILL garbage.I have yet to play an online game with Scrabble *ONLINE*."
4,Good implementation - some whistles broken,"I'm generally very impressed with the game. The gameplay is quick, the graphics are well done but not over the top, and enjoyment is high. This is certainly an upgrade from previous versions.My criticisms:* Analyze play crashes the game on both my WinXP and my Win98 box. Atari has not posted a patch to fix this as of my writing.* There are very few folks playing online. I've seen no more than a half-dozen folks at GameSpy playing. This is perhaps an issue with how new the game is, but I was hoping for more.* After every turn from the computer player, the game stops and says that it's your turn, requiring you to click a dialog box to continue. Very annoying.Overall it was a good effort, but not as good as it could have been."
1,Hasbro's CD is sooooo much better,"I received a gift card from my son and so I started looking for a scrabble game that I wanted to work better with my Windows XP. So I found the Scrabble Online from Atari. I even chose the BRAND NEW, instead of USED. I received the box yesterday, 10/2/06, promptly installed it and played most of the afternoon, trying to get used to it. The game was very unforgiving, and I could not find a way to change the default options. It would also stop and I have to click the annoying notice in front of me so I can take my turn. My complaints are many because I found the game not enjoyable.Today I am trying to find out how to return it - who cares for this. My seller has an error on his/her email and my Comcast server won't send it.Lesson Learned."
5,These guys rule!,"Look out for this up and coming band. This cd is awesome from beginning to end. A great debut album by a great band, a must have for all hardcore music fans."
5,This book covers it all!,"This book is great for both the experienced angler and those newto steelheading. Mr. Kusherets' writing style is inviting and the book iswell illustrated. From advice on equipment selection, to an illustratedtutorial on reading holding water, to advanced tips and techniques, to new perspectives on the sport, this book covers it all - Nicely done!"
4,Drift fishing is still hard.,"Very informative book. Well written. I have read it through twice and I'm trying my best to follow all of the authors advice. Drift fishing is still an illusive sport and this is my first steelhead season so I have a lot to learn (stuff you can't learn from a book). Anyway, the author does let you in on some pretty good secrets. In my experience, most steelhead fishermen are pretty tight lipped."
2,Poorly edited and disjointed,"I bought this book to learn the basics of west coast steelhead drift fishing. While it started out OK, and the author seems to have a lot of knowledge, the book was a disappointment. It is so poorly edited it looks like several articles, pieces of articles, and even sentence fragments were swept off of someone's desk and into a book jacket, given a cursory spell check, and published. There are misspelled words, sentences that appear to mean one thing and say the opposite, and some phrases are repeated 3-4 times verbatim in different parts of the book. The photos do not have reference numbers (e.g. figure 1, 2, etc.) which would really help to be sure which one the author is talking about. And the author seems to assume that the reader already knows what a 'drift rig' is. It's a shame that between the author and Amato publishing that the editorial process got such short shrift. I would not recommend this book.. there must be better ones on this topic."
4,Good but limited,"I thought this book was very informative BUT some of the training techniques just didn't work with my chocolate lab. While the information was good there wasn't much about what to do if your dog has a problem with say, the heeling training technique. I learned a lot, but I needed another book or to enroll my retriever puppy in a class."
5,I Recommend This Training Guide,"I bought this book soon after bringing home my lab six months ago. I don't hunt. But I figure that if hunting is what this dog was bred to do, I would spend some time giving him something of the experience. We do walk the forest preserves and farmer's fields frequently.The methods are based on understanding trainer and pup's behaviors, simple obedience commands, creating a steady dog, and training in habits that you want your dog to have. The lessons are set out as self-paced exercises. They are described concisely and clearly. I have found them to be easy and fun. My pup seems to like them, too.This book is very enjoyable to read. I have read the chapters over and over again, getting some new insight nearly every time. We still have a ways to go before we have mastered all of the skills, but we have the confidence to keep trying because Milner's book has produced successes along the way we've passed."
5,BEST BOOK ON DOGS YET!!!!,"Milner gets you inside the head of retrievers and lets you look at things from their point of view. Having raised many other hunting dogs(beagles and walker coonhounds), my approach was much different with my new pup(Logan;) than with the previous dogs. My dog at three months is much better behaved and trained than any dog I have personally owned or seen. READ THIS BOOK LIKE IT WAS THE BIBLE!!! Everything works EXACTLY as he writes it!! The knowledge you receive makes pups a pleasure instead of a pain(cleanups, chewing, and wandering off on a destruction spree). This book starts with the basics and continues on to very advanced training. All of which, in an EASY to follow and understand way, relies on a building block method. YOUR DOG DESERVES TO BE TRAINED IN THIS EXCELLENT, NON-VIOLENT WAY!!! It will be the best money you've spent(except for your dog, of course)!!"
5,Exelent choice,"It starts with a nice introduction of the ways the author sees tango.Then there are chapters with great exercises for balance and technique, and the last part is the golden key to the dance theory.Great job!"
1,HORRIBLE text,"The WORST history text I've ever had the displeasure of reading. My poor professor had just started, and they had selected this for history class without his consent. We hardly ever used it after the first 2 months. Professors, seriously, choose a different book. There are hundreds better than this."
1,not a very good book,"I don't think it was a good book on the subject. The book lacks real life examples, and in my opinion was just a rip off."
4,Good coaching tool,"I use this book and the online EQ appraisal as a coaching tool in my consulting work with managers and professionals. It's easy to read and gives us a common language for discussing key points about emotional intelligence. I especially like the self-assessment of personal and social competence as a non-threatening way to help people identify destructive reationship behaviors and create strategies to improve their abiltiy to relate to others. A simple, practical and useful approach to the topic of emotional intelligence."
4,Managers & above: please read!,"If you don't know the difference between your I.Q. and your E.Q. and how much it matters in the workplace, then read this book--especially if you're a supervisor, manager, director or CEO. There's even an on-line test to see how you rate.Run--don't walk--and get this book. Better yet: order it right now on Amazon :-) (Your employees will thank you!)"
3,EI Testing,This is a good intro book into Emotional Intelligence. The purchase allows the reader to take a free online EI test which is very helpful.
1,Just alot of filler and no real information.,"Just like most of the one star reviews state, there is nothing that can be learned from this book. The book is sort of like a paper written by a procrastinator 2 hours before class starts. Basically stating that emotional intelligence can be obtained or accessed, but never HOW. There is a couple of stories of celebrity stories in this book. I have not read the full version because of a review on the full version that said the quick book was just as good. Since I feel like I have been ripped off, I will not give the original book a chance. But if I had the choice over again, I would have picked up the original version. [...]"
1,No how-to,I gave this book to my wife. We both thought it was basically a promotion for Emotional Intelligence. It says that it can be done but nothing on HOW to do it or concrete things. Read the original or other books by Goleman for the real thing.
2,Halfway There,"The Good: Assuming the information is accurate, the book does an excellent job in defining Emotional Intelligence, laying out its relevance and, convincing the reader of the need to develop emotional intelligence skills.The Bad: Perhaps the most important section of the book, that is, the development of one's emotional intelligence skill seems to boil down to: ""try to identify emotions and, then use them in a healthy way."" After all the time spent convincing the reader that emotional intelligence is trainable, you would think they would have established a good, concrete, working plan that a reader could easily and definitively follow.Recommendation: Get it if you need a crash course in what emotional intelligence is, because this is where the books excels. However, even for this purpose, I would recommend borrowing it or just reading it in-store."
3,...You gotta remember it's Goosebumps.,"The acting is terrible the story of Slappy makes not a lick of sence(mainly because Slappy gets killed in Night of the Living Dummy II and III) And the ending to ""An Old Story"" is (REAL) cheesey. But like I said: ""...You gotta remember it's Goosebumps.""Here's a breif refrence of both episodes:""Bride of the Living Dummy""-Wal preforming a vantroliquist act, Slappy(brout to life with the voice of the strange Cathal J. Dodd)falls dropp-dead in love with a little girl named Katie's(Sophie Bennett) or so they think...""An Old Story""-Jon and Tom's(Jordan Allison and Kyle J. Downes)parents are out and their grandma is in. So she feeds them prune cookies and they end up looking 48 years older.Grades:Cover=D+""Bride of the Living Dummy""=B-""An Old Story""=C-"
1,RIP OFF,"IF you have eyes, youll notice that everything else goosebumps is under $5, or close to. Yea, no way is that smart to price it that high. Ive never even heard of that one, and I used to collect them!"
4,Meditative and relaxing,This CD sets a beautiful meditative mood as the unusual sounding Arcosanti Bells delight and relax. Good sound for background to gentle exercise.
4,Vanity,"I really enjoyed this book by Karen Miller. This story is about Tiara, and she think everything is ABOUT HER. She don't even realize that she is only wrapped in herself and doesn't care for no one except herself. It's until she hits her very bottom to see how rotton she is."
3,Just OK,"Miller makes an attempt to delve into the life of Tiara, a beatiful young girl raised by her father after she and her sister were abandoned by their gold-digging mother. Unfortunately, Tiara has taken her father's love and affection as a sign that she should be the center of every man's universe. This leads to some troubling times in the Bynum family. She, like many other sisters wants the man with all the cash but overlooks the brother with upstanding values and character. Even though this book has some interesting characters, it does a mediocre job of tackling the issues at hand. I put this book down for about a month before I picked it up again. That's not a good sign!"
2,NOT! NO WAY! NO HOW!,"I did not like this book, I thought it was rather drawn out. I was almost at the end of the book when it got somewhat interesting! It was way to much time spend on Tiara, and she was not even a well develop character. It took me almost 3 weeks to finish this book. I just kept hoping that it was going to get better. But it was not a good read. I do not recommend this book. I have to agree with some of the other people, Mrs. Karen E. Quinones Miller. "" YOU DO NOT HAVE IT LIKE THAT""."
1,Hated it!,"This book was a total waste of time, all that went on in the book was Tiara and her friends arguing and talking to each other like dogs. She was also a spoiled brat that whined so much, I could've slapped her myself. I don't know what's going on with the author, but her books haven't been worth anything since Satin Doll."
2,Mediocre,"I read this book and I was disappointed. It focused on a girl who is very superficial and only seems to care about herself. I think in the end she really did not deserve to be happy. She still had the same attitude toward everything and the only reason she did not accept the money is because she did not want Rashad and her father to figure out she hasn't changed.I thought the novel ""I'm Telling"" by Ms Karen Quinones Miller was much better."
1,No tread longivity,I thought this toy would be made from true tire material. I does not seem to be. My dog had destroyed this tire in a few days. I have bought other tire toys that have lasted for months.
2,Sm. X-Tire Ball,"My dogs don't care for this toy...just too hard for them, I guess. Was hoping it would be softer construction."
5,"Very helpful, accurate and informative","The book was a birthday present to me two months before a trip to Vancouver to visit my daughter. The Vancouver downtown map showed me the nearest hotel to her address and the prices quoted for hotels were a good guide. She has been in Canada for eight months, but did not know of a restaurant (Roosters Quarters) recommended in Denman Street which is 10 minutes walk away. This book saved me money, was a pleasure to read, and made the many other guides I looked at in the library totally redundant."
5,another great funkadelic record,"man funkadfelic was the greatest rock band in my opinion and this just improves the legacy the first song comin round the mountain is hot with a solo from eddie hazel that's on fire his fans should check this out and the title track hardcore jollies is another instrumental where eddie goes for his includes adolescent funk with bernie doing his keyboard wizardry and just this man was a keyboard genius and made p funk the way it is with eddie and also contains a live version of cosmic slop which is okay and other cuts include smokey, and you scared the lovin outta me all classics and worth the money if you like p funk."
4,Among his most enjoyable CDs.,"Jeffrey Osborne experienced a career rebirth thanks to this near-perfect CD. The gorgeous, lushly-produced and arranged ballads ""Sending You A Love Song"", ""Nitetime"", ""Getting Better All The Time"", the title track and the timeless ""The Morning After I Made Love To You""are all nclassy Quiet Storm ballads that hold their own with t6hose from the '60s and '70s--something you can't say about most post-1986 R&B--but it's true indeed here. Get it while you still can."
5,My Absolute Favorite Album,"Jeffrey Osborne...what can I not say about him... What A Talent. The one album that deserves to be back in print. I have had 2 copies both of which i got after it was years out of print. Anyway, this is the album that turned me on to the man, it is my favorite because it is simply some of the best R&B of it's time. It's a Joy to hear a quiet storm master at his best. Every song is amazing, and I love it from start to finish. I know all the songs by heart even. Thank you Jeffrey, you're truly an inspiration!!"
4,It All Starts At The Begining,"""Best Kept Secrets"" by Rochelle Alers is the story of the begining of the Cole-Diaz empire. A love story between a self made millioniare and a women born of cuban royalty. Reading ""Best Kept Secrets"" will help you understand the relationship of Samuel and M.J. The loyalty and love a women has for a man. The love and devotion a man has for a women his wife. You will be cheering M.J. on has she claims her womanhood and her husband. You will have a hate love relationship for Samuel as he builds the empire for his family. This is a wonderful history lesson and a page turner."
5,So...That's What Happened!,I'd read the other Alers books and had questioned the story behind the great Cole-Diaz Empire. Reading this explained everything. Great writing and plot. Love the work.
5,Wonderful,"It was great to see how Samuel Cole started his empire and how he fell in love with M.J. I have to say though even though I knew about the circumstances surrounding Samuel and his affair that produced Joshua I was still absolutely appalled with Sammy and M.J and the way they treated Joshua and his mother not even including Everett and how he treated Theresa. I absolutely did not approve of it and in a way it made me hate Samuel and M.J. With all that considered it was great to see how their love survived lies,betrayal, discrimination and the pressures of building an empire."
5,Book of the year!!!!!!,"I usually don't write reviews, but I couldn't stay quiet about this book. Best Kept Secrets was great!!! An all nighter where you have to know what's going to happen next. We finally got to see how the Cole Family was started and it was well worth the wait. We're only one month into the new year, but I say Best Kept Secrets is book of the year."
3,Practice Tests,"The book provides many practice tests, yet review of the material is limited. I think you can augment your studies for the Caseworker exam with better resources."
4,4 stars for fun,"This is a hard-hitting but very fun CD of Irish pub songs. It sounds like they have all been enjoying their beer while recording this CD. I heard some of this on CBC II and am not disappointed with what I got. If you want irreverent fun, this is it. Go for it."
5,"I've Fallen, And I Can't Get Up!","The world is better place since ""If I should Fall from the Grace With God"" has been re-mastered and re-issued -- this is the Pogues at their roarin' best! In fact, with this re-issue you won't care if you've fallen and can't get back up-- you'll be havin' too much fun listenin' to this classic disc that has been out of circulation and missing too long on the out print lists. Fall out with this one for best of class good sounds!"
3,Good cd,"Thsi CD is ok, but the songs do sorta sound sthe same after a while. Also the second or thrid song has the 'f' word repeated over and over.."
5,Fantastic,"Although some reveiws will paint this album as a sort of nationalistic, English-hating diatribe, it would be best to take those reveiws with a grain of salt. After all, half of the band was English. However, political interpretations aside, this album is just plain phenomonal. With tracks like 'Fiesta' and 'Turkish Song of the Damned', The Pogues showed that they were most definitely NOT just a punk version of The Chieftains. Although both of their 'Best of' albums may have an overall better selection of songs, no Pogues album in existence is as cohesive, or exhibits the over quality that '...Grace With God' does. Basically, for all of you who are familiar with The Pogues and do not own this album, you should know by now that this is their most essential album of all. And for those of you who are not familiar with their music: if you want to try/buy something new, then I would vehemently suggest this album here. Thanks."
5,Great Irish sound,"Great album. Doesn't include the bonus tracks that come with the CD, but if you like vinyl, it's worth it. I can listen to this thing the whole way through."
5,An enduring favorite,"I bought this tape (when we had tapes, not CDs) in college and have almost worn it out. One of the all-time greates albums, ever. Every song is different and memorable. My favorite has to be the title track - always peps me up and gets me moving. A sentimental close second is Fairytale of New York - just twisted enough to actually resemble my life. You must own this one!"
5,THIS IS A GREAT GAME!,I play this game with my friend.We have fun playing it.If you get a nintendo 64 get this game with it.I bet you would enjoy it. ...
3,Okay game but was boring.,"I guess you get what you pay for. This game was dull and i didn't even want to beat it. Anyway, it was a game that i would not give to anyone."
5,3D Action Fun!,"The graphics on this game are amazing, especially with the new expansion pack. You get the stellar game and the n64 to go with it. And all for a great price!"
4,Green goes the Knight,"I first saw this production about twenty years ago, more or less. I like the nod it gives to the celto/pagan elements of the tale. The armour, while not probably what Arthur and his men may have worn, assuming they existed, and they may have, it is still in keeping with the traditional vision of what a knight looked like. There is an interesting mix of romantic knighthood vs the bully-thug with the sword. The behavior was, perhaps somewhere in the middle. The sound effects and special effects are a little dated, but, well, it is about twenty years old. The Green Knight's axe looks sharp and deadly, but the effect is ruined by the jetcraft sounding noise which whirrs as Connery swings it about. I strongly recommend this for any language arts instructor teaching the Arthuriad or mythology.Gilbert Sarabia"
2,Camp,This is so camp its funny. This is a great story and I got the movie for my class. The movie is so awful its funny and the kids did have a great time commenting all through it. Everyone had a great laugh. Not really what I wanted but they enjoyed it.
1,same old dvd,"When I saw this as a new release I thought maybe I would get a widescreen version, but this is the same standard dvd that I've seen available elsewhere before. If you don't mind watching a movie that has been cut down to fit on your TV, and you like fantasy, this is a great movie to have in your collection, but personally I can't abide full screen presentations of movies that were not filmed in that format."
2,"It wasn't meant to be as funny as I found it, I'm sure.","I got this DVD on a whim, seeing several beloved names in the cast list (Connery, Rhys-Davies, Cushing). What I learned, even from just the trailer, was that good actors can't make up for a low budget, other not-so-good actors, dreadful costumes, or lousy cinematography. That said, I did enjoy watching it, because it was so bad in such obvious ways. It was almost like watching a Monty Python skit. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hadn't seen it before, though."
2,Don't release a 2.35 film in pan and scam,"Although hampered by a wooden performance from Miles O'Keefe (in a role obviously written for Mark Hamill, which he turned down to do Shakespeare in the Park (and then ended up not getting cast), this is a masterfully directed and clever film from Stephen Weeks, now better known as a documentarian and the restorer of Penhow Castle. I have the old VHS release, with huge yellow bands in the opening titles indicating how wide the image is supposed to be. I imagine the DVD is identical. While it's nice this hard to see film is available, MGM was an irresponsible Procrustes, much like with their Remo Williams DVD."
2,a stinker,"This movie stank so bad that I felt the urge break out the air freshener after watching it. Sean Connery is wonderful as usual but the Green Knight actually has a more of a cameo rather than starring role and bless his heart, Sean often has lousy judgemetn about script quality. Miles O'Keefe as Sir Gawain was terrible. The plot was weak, the special effects were'nt special and the scenery looked more like suburban North Carolina than Arthurian England. Avoid this turkey."
3,Strange,Sword of the Valiant is an attempt at a literal adaptation of one of the most truly bizarre and surreal epic poems to come out of medieval Europe; one full of symbolism never meant to be taken literally; with too small of a budget to pull it off. Try picturing Terry Gilliam's Baron Munchausen without any of Gilliam's panache. Watching this when I was a young kid while I was home with a fever gave me a good idea of what a drug trip must be like. This one's more for the Teletubbies crowd than for anyone looking for a good story.
2,Green Knight,"This movie is best enjoyed with small children or drunks. The premise: A slightly homo-erotic-tailored Sean Connery as the green knight (think armored Zardoz) decides to challenge the nearby king's court to a game of wits and bravery. The challenge is answered by Sir Gawain, Miles O'Keeffe, whose ridiculous 80's hair stretches credulity more than the unicorns and witches. If you're prepared to laugh and enjoy the great overplayed soundtrack this film has to offer, like so many funnier repeats of the 1981 Excalibur, this is a movie for you."
1,shot in widescreen - chopped for DVD,"Why amazon does not tell you up front this movie has been chopped for the DVD I don't know. This release is standard version, not widescreen."
2,B Movie To Say The Least,Was dissappointed in this movie. Was actually embarrassed for Sean Connery. It wasn't a role I would have expected he would have accepted. It lacked continuity and was downright boring.
1,Leave well enough alone,"The film did not follow the literature at all. The only section that was unscathed was the very beginning when the Green Knight first makes the challenge. From then on Hollywood made their own story, theme, morals, etc."
2,Not a great movie. Not even a pretty good movie.,"Basically, several people outta be shot for their sins on this film. Sir Gawain's horrible Veronica Lake blond wig is just awful. Even worse is the synthesizer sound track. Sounds like it was pulled out of any number of cheesy shows. There's low-budget porn with better music than this.Aside from that, the film is at times engaging, and Sean Connery is as always fine to see.But in the rather large group of Arthurian films, this is one certainly to be missed."
1,"Cheesy costume, film","Why do I even bother reading some of these incredibly over exaggerant reviews. The costumes in this film looks 2nd class and more like something you find in a Halloween party, does not even look real."
1,"This one's by ""Stevie"" Lawrence, not Steve Lawrence","Man, did my sinus clear out when I opened this CD. On the cover is a semi-abstract picture of a guitar, and ""stevie lawrence"" written across the top. On the back is a picture of said ""stevie lawrence"" with a full head of skin playing a guitar. In the fine print at the bottom it says the album was produced in Glasgow,Scotland. The titles of some of the songs are: ""Psycho Magnet,"" ""Hedgehope Hill,"" ""Megajig Set,"" ""Stobieside Lodge,"" and ""Border Spirit."" Oviously this is not a recording of Eydie Gorme's husband, but of someone of a similar name from the other side of the pond. I have not taken off the shrink-wrap to play this CD. I intend to return it to ... right away for a refund. But just by the titles, I can tell this is not the kind of album that would smoke the shorts of an old geezer like myself."
2,Unexploded Bomb Received.,"I ordered large type book for my 80-year-old Mother, received the book but not large type. Was told to re-order it but it probably wouldn not arrive in time for her birthday. 2nd book arrived with jacket for Testimony of Two Men but book inside was called ""Unexploded Bombs"" by a WW2 General! Unfortunately I had this mailed directly to her and she thought it was a joke. Now it isn't available to re-order. Do you think the person who ordered ""Unexploded Bombs"" is reading ""Testimony of Two Men""? By the way, Amazon has never responded to my email re their ""incredible"" customer service. I wasn't going to review but Amazon keeps sending the email requesting a review. There you go."
5,"truly a beautiful, moving novel","a very beautifully written, meaningful novel regarding a man of medicine attempting to move a town into the modern medical era. jonathan ferrier is a great character and his story of doctoring and unrequited love is heartbreaking and moving. i've read it a couple of times over the years and it is one of caldwell's best novels. a truly enjoyable book that can hold it's own against most of the popular fiction(and some literary fiction) being published today."
4,CD player kit,"This allowed me to install an aftermarket CD player in my Lexus LS400. It wasnt a perfect fit, and needed some pushing to get it seated properly. Once installed it has worked fine. Doesn't really match the rest of the dash but it serves it purpose and blends in with the CD player. Fast shipping. Great seller."
3,"Few dance beats, but slow ...","This compilation album is great but it lacks the energy with all songs to go all out... Isha D ""stay"" is a great jam thoughCould be inproved, removal of some tracks."
2,"Look out, Chucky. There's a new midget on the block",Valley girl and her father move out to a country setting unaware that in their basement is a killer leprechaun looking for his pot of gold. Does that sound right? Entertaining and fun little horror film is spoiled by sloppy gore and nastiness. Funny how almost the entire cast are comedians.
1,Leprechaun Review,"The Leprechaun is not scary. It looks like a melted Muppet reject. The other leprechaun from A Very Unlucky Leprechaun is more scary then the Lucky Charms reject. The plot is silly even for a horror film about a leprechaun. The performances by the human actors is unbelievable for the worst including the young Jennifer Aniston. There is only one good line but can't type or else they won't post it. Overall,watch A Very Unlucky Leprechaun to be scared. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
1,Suckfest 1993 Style,"The worst movie in the entire world is better than this. Rated R...perhaps for ""Ridiculous""? there was absolutely nothing scary about this movie, except for the lack of talent and the wardrobe. Eeesh. Who would subject themselves to this movie? Unless you want a great laugh, stay awayyyy."
1,Lamest horror movie EVER!,"Leprechaun is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made! Seriously, the plot makes absolutely no sense, everyone in this flick is stupid, and the lines are all cheesy. Do yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs! Don't believe me? Check out the Nostalgia Critic's review of this film! He hated it as much as I did!"
3,Enjoyable flick,"I can't give out half-stars, because if I could, this would actually be 3.5, not just 3 stars. I can't quite bring myself to give a 4, but it is definitely better than a 3. It was a pretty good flick for its time, and though it's cheesy today, it was a very enjoyable watch. The actor who does Leprechaun is AWESOME, and frankly, he was the best character in the movie.The premise is actually rather believable/enjoyable, so I can't complain about the backstory. Seeing Jennifer Aniston was an unexpected treat (I caught this on TV by pure chance, never having heard of it before) and again, the Leprechaun is fun. I WANT ME GOLD!I can't say that this is a great horror flick because it made me laugh. It's one of these horror movies that you just can't help but enjoy and laugh at, and that's what I liked about it. So really, it's not a horror in the genre of Saw, Hostel, or Dracula, but it can be appropriately called a horror-comedy. If you like leprechauns, you'll enjoy this movie."
3,LUCK OF THE IRISH,"Now noted for the somewhat inauspicious debut of FRIENDS Jennifer Ashton, this tidy little horror movie is fun to watch, much of that due to the infectious villainy of Warwick Davis as the devilish little leprechaun who wants ""me gold back."" That's pretty much the plot, the little guy trying to get his gold back from a little boy and his mentally challenged friend. Aniston is serviceable, and Ken Olandt adds some beef for the girls. It's mindlessly entertaining, sort of a miniature Freddy Krueger villain."
5,"Cheesy, silly, fun","This is another of my fav movies. This first installment beats out the second and comes close to the third.Warwick is hilariously funny as the Leprechaun, and its too bad that he's one of Hollywood's underappriciated actors.If you like cheesy, campy fun this movie is definately for you!"
4,one of my favorite movies!,"i dont know why this movie was in the horror section when i rented it.it should of been in comedy.this movie was just hilarious.the leprechaun's accent cracked me up.get this movie,and you'll wanna watch it a million more times.great movie."
1,leaves you like your done kissing a horses ass,"blehhhh, horrible beginning to a horrible series. this is either scary nor funny, though its fun in some parts if I may correct myself. but no logic and a stupid premise involving shillings(what arent shillings like a penny a piece, so if the leprechaun has 100 shillings, then he has a dollar, cool plot to kill off people, he must of been in poverty at the time). and Jennifer Aniston is wasted too. ugghhhh"
1,bad in a bad way done badly by bad people to punish you for being bad,"this is friggin horrible. it commits the crime that prevents a bad movie becoming a so-bad-it's-good-movie by being being so incredibly boring. perhaps if you are amused by physically small people and still haven't come to terms with the fact that they feel like us, they hope like us, they feel sad like us -- they ARE us but they're physically small then this movie could be for you. or maybe you have watched every film in the world already and this is the only one left and you thirst for something new, doesn't matter what, just needs to be new. some people say violence in movies and games is a sign our society is in decay. i say this movie is the sign - it's existence looks bad for the future of humankind."
1,Don't!!,"I can sum this all up in one statement: Don't even go there! This film, with no insults to Jennifer Aniston or Warwick Davis (Both two of my favorite actors), stinks (in my opinion)!!!"
3,Another Original Horror Hero!,"After capturing a true leprechaun and stealing his pot of gold, Dan O'Grady thinks life is just great. Until the leprechaun wants his pot of gold back and becomes an Irishman's nightmare.I found this movie to be just great. It had originality, suspense, but not a whole lot of scares. Some scenes also stole from Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and The Leprechaun was also funny like Freddy Krueger. But he ain't the only funny guy in the film. Don't forget Ozzie - the fat (...) guy. He's one of the reasons why LEPRECHAUN is an awesome horror flick. He ended up being one of those useless guys who do everyone a favor by risking his life and creating a diversion.I've only seen the first two LEPRECHAUN films so far, and the first one is the best. The sequel ain't that bad, but it doesn't really compare to the first. In fact, it doesn't even take off from the original film.LEPRECHAUN is fun to watch.I hope my review was helpful to you!"
5,The best killer leprechaun movie this decade,"What could be funnier, or scarier, then an Irish dwarf on a deadly quest for his gold? Not very much, I tell you. This is the ""Fargo"" of killer Leprechaun films--well constructed, edgy with a bawdy sense of humor, and plus that funny accent. Warwick Davis was robbed of his Oscar, but here's hoping for ""Leprechaun 5,"" when this talented group of filmmakers will finally get their recognition."
3,Aniston at her best!!!!,"I love Jennifer Aniston on friends. But she first stole my heart with this wonderful performance. I wish she would quit making those awful romantic/gay comedies and go back to her best genre, the leprechaun horror film. Watch this movie once and you'll never look at her on friends in the same way again."
3,An enjoyable B movie,This movie is enjoyable even though it is far from oscar-worthy. I would recommend steering of the other leprechaun movies. The fourth one being the worst of them all! The second one if I didn't know any better I'd think it was a quasiporno.This one at least has a story worth seeing. Personally I think Leprechaun would have been better if they had actually researched Irish legends with some more imagination in the mix.It's not Good but not's terrible either!If you want to see any of the Leprechaun movies see this one and avoid the others.
4,The OG,"Leprechaun 1- this is the 'OG' little green freak show. Ole lep chases the heroine through the green glens of Ireland, lad. They say this is the scariest of the five Lprechaun flicks. I'd say its the most legit- after all, its the OG! But to really see moreof the little green fairy of mischief, check out 'Leprechaun 2'. Heck- get 'em all- numbers one-five in the special Box Set. Saint Patties Day doesn't come often enough to laugh your timbers green, and drown your sorrows in a pool of red!"
4,A Classic!!,"First of all, this movie is not for everybody. Easygoing people who get a kick out of watching a comedy/horror movie will like it and find it entertaining. People who are uptight and nitpicky probably won't. This movie was made to be what it is. It's not supposed to be a serious horror flick. Anybody who assumed it would be HAS to be a little slow. Who in their right mind would read the back of this movie and think it is going to be the ""ultimate"" thriller? LOL. Bottomline: If you're the kind of person who has to watch a perfect horror movie or else it stinks, this movie is not for you. The people who can enjoy this movie without being so picky, myself included, will be just fine without you."
3,"Three stars, a three leaf clover","For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews. I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...Leprechaun (1993 supposedly) is a movie that's both horror-based and humor-based. It stars the highly overrated (both in looks and acting ability) Jennifer Aniston, and Warwick Davis (one of the Ewoks from Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi). This was Aniston's film debut. She does an adequate job, but nothing outstanding. Davis plays the role of the evil leprechaun very well. This is another one of those movies that has a small but sinister villain (similar to Chucky). I give credit to the movie makers for coming up with such a villain as an evil leprechaun. This movie has a cult following and believe it or not, had five sequels. I heard a reboot of the franchise is in order for 2013.Overall, this movie is worth a look if you can tolerate lots of humor injected into a horror movie."
1,You'll be sorry.,"This is one of the most mesmorizingly awful horror movies I've ever seen! Irritatingly inept and insipid, this slasher has dubious jokes, sharp shocks of gore, ill logic, and mind-numbing predictability to make you wish you had rented something else. The movie is so banal you can play ""Mystery Science Theatre"" while watching it. Even Halloween 6 would do the job better! While wathcing this movie on T.V. I can remember what my Dad said after commercial breaks:""Aw, we have to watch the movie? I was hoping we could watch more commercials!""That statement should tell you something."
4,BIZARRE FUN FROM 1933,"A totally unhinged comedy which makes up for exuberance what it lacks in sense. Moviegoers in 1933 relished this comedy fricassee, garnished with songs and handsomely served by director Eddie Sutherland. This picture is a real curio, and a unique one at that! Where else can you see Baby Rose Marie belt out a song (yes, this is the same Rose Marie who played Sally Rogers on THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW). Cab Calloway doing his famous REEFER MAN number among other assorted novelties. It all takes place in China at the International House hotel where an ""advanced"" version of television (called a radioscope) is being shown. Top this: W.C. as an sir pilot and professor; George Burns and Gracie Allen as a dotty doctor and nurse; Stuart Irwin breaking out in a rash whenever he proposes to luscious Sari Maritza; the much-married Peggy Hopkins-Joyce luring Fields to her boudoir................"
4,Nighttime Relief!,"I have dry mouth due to radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. The OralBalance gel helps me to sleep as many as 6 hours straight without waking up due to dry mouth pain. The taste seems neutral to me, but I don't have much sense of taste at the moment. It is a bit like sticking pnut butter to the roof of your mouth, spreading it out evenly with your tongue, and then leaving it there. The gel breaks down a little at a time and keeps your mouth nice and moist. If you have a dry throat, this can help a little bit, since you get some wetness to swallow every so often. Sometimes I still need a swallow of water to wet down the throat. Overall I am very happy with the product and am grateful for the improvement in my quantity and quality of sleep. My only complaint is I kinda wish it was available in a larger size!"
5,Biotene's the Best!,"I take medication that dries my mouth, plus I sometimes sleep with my mouth open. Using Biotene gel keeps my mouth from becoming completely dry, which goes a long way toward my better oral health overall."
3,"Helpful, but not long-term solution","Helps in moistening mouth, makes mouth feel wet. Pleasant flavor - very mild and subtle. Results are short-term -like a couple of minutes at the most."
5,Recomended by my dentis but hard to find!!,I hunted every drug store and big box store. The price I got here was 3.00 less. This product is excellent for sleeping and preventing dry mouth. That is a must for some of us on a lot of meds.
3,I keep this product by my bed side,"I like to use it at night, when I wake up in the middle of the night and experience dry mouth. It's usually effective though not as effective as other products I have used. It's effects don't last more than an hour if so long."
1,poor,Hard to use as it tends to gag you when you put it in your mouthy. Couldnt really tell a difference in my always dry mouth;
3,CPap use,I use this along with Xylimelts at night and it works pretty well together by itself it doesn't last long enough.
2,The Biotene gel is just too thick to spread well!,"That's the long and the short of it. It's so thick that it doesn't go into the nooks and crannies. I much prefer the Biotene LIQUID, which is easier to get it to cover where it's needed. Biotene does make good products. My dry mouth is the result of radiation treatment. I do notice that both the spray and liquid tend to make me hoarse."
5,S&H fees too high,Product is wonderful; however with the S&H fees for this item purchased here it adds approximately $2.00 per tube ordered to the price. Not a shavings from the local drug store!!
1,I'd rather suffer from dry mouth1,"I ordered this product because I have always suffered from dry mouth. Mostly because of some medications I take. Well I did this treatment only once at night and almost threw it up. That was the grossest most disgusting taste I have had in any type of treatment and it did not work that well to relieve the dry mouth problem anyway. I did order the other biotene products such as the mouth rinse and the spray and although the taste is not as bad, they also didn't help that much with dry mouth. I would highly recommend that people save their money and buy gum (sugarless or not) instead that they can chew on to create more saliva."
3,Loved the product but not the company,"I bit down on a large piece of broken plastic that came in one of the bags of apple chips. I sent 2 emails to notify the company. The first person didn't care; the second asked me to send in the broken plastic piece and they would send me a free bag. I spent time and money packaging and mailing the piece and never got the free bag. I really loved this product, but the company left me with a bad taste in my mouth in more ways than one. The only other comment about the product itself would be that there are often a lot of tiny specks of chips rather than mostly large pieces."
1,Movie is in the wrong aspect ratio !,"I saw a newly restored print of ""The Sweet Smell of Success"" (1957) at the Chauvel Cinemas in Sydney on the weekend. The new print was very good and no scratches present.My biggest gripe about this DVD (I don't own a copy and won't) is that the aspect ratio is completely wrong. This film was shot in 1.85 and not 1.66 which means you're losing a lot of the picture.I advise people to think carefully about how much of the picture they want to see as there is quite a bit of difference between a widescreen ratio of 1.85 and 1.66.Also, I'm hoping the newly restored print version I saw on the weekend might surface on a new DVD edition and be in the right screen ratio.Newcastleboy"
2,HARD TO TELL WHAT'S GOING ON.,"The dialogue moves along so fast, and the plot is so sketchy, that I had a difficult time understanding it. I know that many viewers feel the same way but don't want to bother writing a review: most reviews are positive. So think this one over."
3,¿Conjugate me a verb¿,"MY RATING-7.3I&#65533;ve seen this some days ago, and i must say at first i wasn&#65533;t very interested in those quick and cynical dialogues between Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster, but then I realised the story was deliciously evil and I kept myself stick to the screen.What a screenplay! It was made by North By Northwest&#65533;s Ernest Lehman and it gives us an accurate view of corruption and use of blackmail in the press. Curtis is excellent as the &#65533;cookie full of arsenic&#65533; as well as Lancaster in an ususual &#65533;villain&#65533; role as the obsessive caring brother and reputed press writer. My favorite line between the two is when Curtis says &#65533;No, J.J not even by a full column--&#65533; and then stops.Attention also to the excelent cinematography b/w that films the city as well as the nice jazzy score by Elmer Bernstein."
4,Sweet Movie,"If you want to see two consumate acting pros go head to head then you've got to see this movie!!. Not only is the acting top class but it also gives you an insight into the seedier side of New York. Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis are in rare form, also watch out for a great performance by Barbara Nichols as Curtis's old flame.Ernest Lehman's story moves along at a cracking pace. All in all a really well made film.............a feast for the eye and the ear."
2,Wallow in agita for an hour and a half til the credits,"This story is too agitating. It's about a couple of slime balls. The dialogue isn't great, it's phony, too cool in that film noir fifties way. The emotional ride it takes you on is not enjoyable to go on, and there's nothing in the artistry or anything else to make it worthwhile.It is about a psycho news columnist who has a very weird attachment to his sister. He will do anything to keep his sister under his thumb and to break up her engagement to her boyfriend. He is also very powerful, able to have the boyfriend arrested, with drugs planted on him, or beaten up by the cops, or worse.I don't understand the entertainment value here. I don't understand why some people like the movie. There's nothing good about it. You just wallow in agita for an hour and a half, and then they show the credits."
1,Overated Film,"I has this misfortune of seeing this film in the theatre years ago.How I felt about it?BORING.Way too much talk.YAP,YAP,YAP.The Burt Lancaster part is based on Walter Winchell.(Poor Walter)I dont think he was any saint,but I wouldnt confuse him with Satan either.Also in cast Tony Curtis.I didnt like this film at all.Burt and Tony made better ones."
1,doesnt deserve even 3 stars.,"I am giving it one star cuz the music is at least very good. but thats the only bright spot. the grpahics suck, even if they are old, they suck period. super mario bros 3 has better looking graphics than this game. very unrealistic and childish game, i liked the serious tones of FF8 and FFX so much. and yes, final fantasy vii was my first rpg ever."
1,tried too hard,"okay first of all, this game like any other final fantasy is different from each other which is good but you have got to know how to divide yourself from your predecessor. This game was very good on certain standards but i Expected more. I have played every final fantasy and this one is in between the good final fantasy and the bad final fantasy. I liked this game and in fact i own this game but i was dissapointed. Overall, it is a game to check out"
1,lame cloud,"cloud the main hero of this game, is the main reason why i hated it so much. he wines and complains all thruout the game. he shrugs his shoulders at ever question thats asked of him. that big sword he uses sucks too. i liked the gunblad from squall better."
1,why did i give it 1 star...,"...when i should have given it like -5 stars? this game sucks, doesnt matter if its old, i like old games too. but this game is so boring and the graphics are bad, even for an old game, bleh!!!!"
1,mislead,boy was i mislead by all the darn 5 star reviews here. this game is destined to be the most dissappointing rpg ever made......E-V-E-R.
2,Way Overrated,"Graphically speaking, the game stands out with its beautiful pre-rendered backgrounds. I also enjoyed the game's amazing soundtrack. The story, however, is poorly written and character development is almost non existent. Was I given a reason to care about Aeris enough to be sad when she died? Materia is a broken system that allows you duplicate itself as many times as you want as long as you master it, essentially giving you the ability to make all of your trivial characters the same person, sans their unique limit breaks. This game most certainly doesn't deserve to be heralded as one of the best RPGs ever. As far as I can discern, the people that praise it as such must be philistines."
5,best rpg ever,"[...]this is the best ff game ever but why the heck do people complain about graphics.this game was one one of the best games 8 years ago,have you seen any game that was better looking at that time.theres also a remake on the ps3 right now for those who think think the graphics are bad.and if you dont still dont like the graphics then you can go f**k yourself.now that i got that out of my mind i can now go play it again"
5,Superb!,"The story of Cloud.....Aries...ect............This is pretty simply cool! Amazing music, I must say! The graphics are great, and the Chocobo ""mini game"" is a grrrrrreeeeeeaaaaaaatttttttt addition.This game is a combo of the finest features...music...graphics.........storyline............ love.......betrayal.........fights...........cinimatic......I have played this game for ages!I love to battle the final boss. The ending is a beautiful thing. The ending takes up a whopping 3/4 of the last disc. This is probobly on my faves top ten list. I won't reveal a smidge of the story, cuz you gotta buy this!"
5,best game of all time,"its weird cause the first time i played it i rented it, and the game was different, in the slums i was in a place of ruins, and after i bought the game and replayed it like 3 times, i never went back to that place. i dont know why, but this game occurs depending on your actions. the storyline was like no other, even waaay better than ff8 or 10.i definetly recommend if you like rpgs, you should buy this game. anyone who says this game is bad, must be my mom."
5,Best Game from Final Fantasy Collection,"Final Fantasy Seven is the best out of the collection yet. Though I can not say out of all of them, though I have played eight and nine as well. The graphics on eight and nine are better, but the graphics on seven are still excellent. Seven has a beautiful and well planned plot to keep the player into the game and come back for more until the game is finally beat, for those who haven't played it yet and you are a big Final Fantasy lover, I suggest you play this one as well! Most people are thrown off because the graphics aren't excellent, but compared to eight and nine, the game plot is wayy better then the newer versions which take most people some time to get into."
5,My Favorite RPG Game Ever,"Final Fantasy VII in my opinion is the best RPG game ever created and it definately blows away the others that have followed. The graphics are not as good as the ones that followed but one has to think of when this game came out. The story was supurb, music was great and there's not too many villians like Sephiroth. It took me many, many hours to beat this and many days at work struggling to stay awake from staying up all night playing. Not too many games have kept my interest like this one did, my life wouldn't have been complete if I didn't beat this game. Most that like this type of games know what I'm talking about but to those who haven't played this should check it out. This is definately the break through game that changed RPG games forever."
5,old school rocks,"yes, this game is omg old, now with this price it ""god""it has strong storyline, great effects and deep meanuing in the story.it is square's best work in FF series"
5,A Must-Have Greatest Hits Game!,"Simply put, the best PS game ever created! This is the game that revolutionized the PlayStation's gaming history & what brought the Final Fantasy series back to life! This 3-disc game not only posseses an in-depth storyline and gameplay, but the amount of extras and hidden bonuses give FFVII neaar endless replay value! This is the game that turned me not only into an avid video game player, but an RPG fanatic! If you have never played this game (if you have never heard of it, then shame and pity on you; if you don't have a PS2, let alone a PS1, then crawl back under your rock), then by all means shell out the [money] to buy this game! You wont regret it, trust me! Enjoy!Ideliron"
4,Final Fantasy VII,"Final Fantasy VII is like any other Final Fantasy game, a great soundtrack and a great story. The graphics don't look as good a Final Fantasy VIII, but it is a very good game. If you like Final Fantasy VI, you'll really like this game."
4,Not much of a challenge,"Okay, don't get me wrong - I loved this game. It was really fun, and it had an entertaining story line and everything, but it was /so/ easy. The first time I played Final Fantasy 3 (or 6, if you prefer), it took me fifty or sixty hours to finish. Playing 7 for the first time, I finished it in just over thirty. I didn't do much of the extra stuff, I admit, but still.... It was so /short/! I'm goin back now and playing through all the subquests, and it's still awesomely fun, but it was a bit of a letdown that first time."
5,Greatest Video Game Memories Ever,"This game was my first RPG back in the day. I absolutely loved it. I really would love to play it again, and I'm sure this game is overhyped for many that didn't play it back in the day. This game had charm, great CG cutscenes, and it totally captured me in the last few hours. Some say it wouldn't hold up by today's standards, and maybe not. But I would love to play it again someday (maybe on PSN) and would love even more a remake done in HD.I've been an RPG fan ever since."
5,Hinting to spoiler..,I just couldn't take it. There were so many negative comments that refer to a certain character dying. This is one of the greatest reasons this storyline was epic. What does no other video ever have?? This death really gives you a sense of loss.So because of this plot point and all the rest of the mystery of the storyline and the game's great music.Because Final Fantasy VII is really a Movie with a game attached.Final Fantasy VII will always be the best RPG.Maybe someone should think about including a similar death in a new video game.
5,Final Fantasy 7- A Marvel from Squaresoft!,"When I was first introduced to the series a couple of years ago. I was into the Zelda games and RPGs like that, but now I know that there are better, more involved games out there like this one. The game starts out fast paced and ends with the most intriging ending I have ever witnessed. It had me thinking about what happened and I couldn't fall asleep for days on end after beating the game. The gameplay in is truly magnificent as once you start playing, you just can't stop until you pass out from playing so long. I did. The music is above par for most of square's games. I enjoyed Aeris's theme and some of the others. While some of it may get old, the beats are enjoyable enough to have you catch yourself humming them in the shower every now and then. The one gripe I have about this game is that the battles get too repetitive. The only thing that keeps me fighting is staring at Tifa........oh never mind."
5,A sublime FF expirience for psx,"Ok, THIS WAS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE. I just had to say that first, but it really is. The magic is so cool with the materia and how you combine materia in slots and the different types of materia. And the weapons because different weapons have different # of slots to put materia in. And the story, It starts as cloud blowing up a reactor and then he finds out sephiroth is back and he tries to find him and meets different characters along the way< the coolest characters being cid highwind and vincent valentine>.Bottom line this is the best rpg and if you like rpg's than you will like this game."
5,Read This If You Really Want To Know What This Game Is About,"Final Fantasy 7 has a Unique storyline, Fantastic graphics, the gameplay is Amazing, the characters are Interesting and they touch your heart. Squarsoft made this game a masterpiece in every way possible. This game is the best RPG in the World! Final Fantasy 7 top's all of the other RPG's in every way!! People say that this game dosn't have good graphics but this game has Fantastic graphics because this game was made in 1997 for a 1997 game the graphics are great!! Final Fantasy 8 and 9 have better graphics because Final Fantasy 8 and 9 were made three years later and in three years the graphics can become a lot better. Buy this game if you want a great game and the best RPG in the World!!!! Thank You For Your Time............."
5,Reminiscing on the past...,"I remember when I played Final Fantasy 7, when I was younger, for the first time. I was introduced to this game by a friend and immediately bought it. I was literally blown away by the excellent/memorable story, characters, and music. This was also one of the first games I literally cried to in some of the sadder moments of the game. FF7 plays like a book: you want to keep turning that page to see what happens next.Everything about this game is just absolutely magnificent and still remains one of my all time favorite Final Fantasy games. The graphics are certainly outdated by todays standards, but it's still quite enjoyable. There is a possibility that Final Fantasy 7 is being completely remade with new graphics for the PS3. It just goes to show how popular FF7 actually is, since it draws so much attention. A movie called Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children also has a story after the events of the game."
5,Made by the RPG Gods,"Yes, the graphics are bad. Yes, the minigames can get boring. Yes, the sounds are a little frustrating to deal with sometimes. Yes, the battle system is a little hard to get along with. However! This game is my favorite of all time along with Final Fantasy VIII. The storyline completely blew me away, so complex and filled with real emotion that i sometimes forgot i was sitting at home in a room playing a game. Truly this is a masterpiece of Square. Just typing this review brings back the great times i had playing the game. Trying to ponder what would happen next only to have it shattered and something i was completely off guard for. I know it sounds a little nerdy but hey, Final Fantasy VII has to be the greatest RPG, or game, to have ever been created. Congrats to those at Square for this fantastic game which made me laugh & cry, truly made by the RGP Gods."
1,"Not the best game ever, not the best rpg,","Well, look. play this game. dont take my word for it, youll be sorly dissappointed by the lack of game. So rent this game or borrow this game and play it. I guarantee you, youll agree this game is bad. the polygons are herondous. the story is kid friendly, and the whole game is a headache."
1,Not my final fantasy.,"I bought this game, played it, and beat it. Im glad i played it cuz it made me thank squaresoft when they made final fantasy 8. Final Fantasy 7 has the worst graphics and the lamest story line of all the final fantasies ive played. Yes, it is overhyped as u have read, and very overrated too. the story is predictable and the graphics, oh no!!!! legos invaded my final fantasy game! the graphics stink. Cloud the hero, is very lame. the cast of characters is alright. This game will bore u to death, seriously will. In my opinion, Final Fantasy VIII is the best final fantasy on Playstation 1."
1,Not too original,"after playing final fantasy 8 and 9 and 10 i decided to play the ""grad-daddy"" of the new final fantasy games. i had heard so much praise about final fantasy 7. But to my dissappointment, this game didnt deliver. I dont know why this game gets 5 star reviews. i would give it a 2 but i was just really bored with the game. i think it was due to the deformed characters and the lame plot."
1,I was bored to death.,"I think this game has alot of fans, but that DOESNT make the game good. In other words, this game is very bad and boring."
1,im tired of all the hype!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"no, this game is not the best final fantasy game ever. and definitely not the best game ever, its not a gem either. its rather mediocore and dull. its like plain vanilla ice cream without the vanilla taste."
1,One star,"Final Fantasy VII. A game that recieved so much hype for one reason and one reason only... it was the first Final Fantasy for Playstation after Square broke off ties with Nintedo. So everyone was waiting for it. The game play is very boring, and the graphics are very bad, yes very bad. The plot is good guy saves world, whoptie-doo. The story lacks direction and closure. This is the weakest Final Fantasy of the newer ""post-nintedo era"" stop defending this game when u know its not as good as the hype. FINAL FANTASY TEN ROCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!"
1,Winner of the Most Overhyped Game of ALL Time Award.,"yes, all overhype. I played this game and finished it. its subpar to final fantasy 8. the story is not good. the blocky figures really are badly rendered. Dont buy this game from what people tell you UNLESS you like the final fantasy series because u will sorely be dissapointed. a character(aeris) dies in the game........u can use phoenix downs on dead characters during battle to revive them......but u cant revive this dead character(aeris) in the plot......BIG STORY PROBLEM THERE! Sephiroth is not a great villan. Bowser from super mario is a greater villan than this joke. Because it was the first final fantasy rpg on playstation coupled with the fact that rpgs was a little known genre in the video game world before this game came out, im supposed to give it 5 stars??? if u wanna start playing a final fantasy rpg game, start with final fantasy 8, the graphics and plot are 100% better and wont bore you like this game."
1,youve heard this before.....,"I know, i know, but seriously, this game is so overrated. this game is #7 at gamespy's list of most overrated games of all time, and i have to agree. this game sits sorta in the middle of all final fantasy games. This is my review so its my opinion and i dont think this game is great and if you're new to the genre, and try to play this game, you'll agree that this game goes nowhere fast."
1,Rolled up mess with a final fantasy title,The most messiest final fantasy game ever created. the graphics stink. totally bad. the ending was so short and made NO sense whatsoever. very ugly game.
2,Final Fantasy 7....,"It had barley any Fantasy in it. There were no evil Emporers or Castles or Multi colored haired people or something a little out of this world. plus the magic was like a piece of clothing, you put it on, or off. This is just my veiw of things. :)"
3,Do not pay $75 or more for a used copy of this. Not worth it.,"I own Final Fantasy VII-X and this is by far the most overrated game in the entire series. My sister told me she bought this game at a vintage store for $60 and I rushed onto Amazon.com to see if she could have gotten it cheaper. I was absolutely appalled. Don't by into the hype. This is a good game, but it is NOT in ANY way worth the price of buying it on this site. Go buy it at a garage sale for $10 or borrow it from a friend for a month or so. People who are expecting others to pay that much money for this are morons."
4,Excellent,"I love this game! All 3 disks were filled with surpirses and every moment of the game was fun. Whoever says that the characters are bad and the stroyline is bad, needs help. Sure, the graphics aren't as good as FFX and there is no voice acting, but the characters and the stroyline are enough to make you forget about the graphics and just have fun. The music was also amazing. I have never really played any RPG's besides FFX and Kingdom Hearts, and when I got this game, I stayed up until 2:00 AM playing it. You don't have to like RPG's tolike this game."
5,A Role-Playing Game (RPG) like no other!,This game came out in 1997 and to this day has still a large following. And when I mean large I mean possibly into the millions. In the US this game really changed what early RPG fans assumed RPGs should be and for new fans it became the standard of what RPGs should have. Think of what RPGs would be today if this game had not been released (cringe)! This game speed up the evolution of RPGs. But we can only imagine the next time another RPG will take the role of changing the face of this genre. This game is not perfect but it deserves respect for what it opened to many gamers. Highly recommended!
5,The greatest game of all-time...any system....flat out.,"Man if you want to experience the greatest video game ever then this is it, look no farther. This game has it all.1. The most well thought out story ever on a video game.2. Great character development.3. Many many side quest.4. Dymatic ending and great finish.If you can find any game that can match that criteria and do it as well as FF7, then I'll eat your hat!!! Screw 5 stars....100 stars!!!"
3,I DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUSS IS ALL ABOUT,"mmmm.... all the other reviewers said that this is the greatest game ever , is it just me or does this game have bad grafics, dont get me wrong, i like this game, but you dont know if your playing the game right and sometimes you miss charaters because you dont know where you are or what you are doing"
5,great game!!,playability... thats the thing. ive beat this so many times and i just love to play it even with my other games like FF 12 and soon to be 13. still one of the greatest games ive played
5,better than FFVIII,"Listen, final fantasy games are about the powers of magic, this FF IS mostly about magic, in FFVIII i don't see any connection with magic powers. This is a great game, i played 2 times cuz you might need play 2 times to understand more the story and get more secrets or materia(magic) I thought FFVIII wasnt REALLy that cool, i tihnk you should buy this over FFVIII"
2,not the best square has made,"I give it 2 stars because of the graf-x. The whole plot is lame too. I liked Tifa but i think Cloud suxs as a hero, hes very lame. I liked Squall's clothes better from FFVIII. Cloud has like purple Mc hammer pants and shirt on."
2,everyone loved this game,everyone did love this game I just didn't like it I'm not a huge turn base RPG fan if I where though this would be a fun game it was enjoyable but very long
1,was the last reviewer even more serious?,"There is no way that VII sold more than VIII. Look at the numbers and it'll show that VIII is the most sold Final Fantasy in N. America & maybe Japan. And another thing, people have the right to defend their favorite game. Just like I could talk about how bad ""Ulysses"" the book was because of dialouge and someone who loved the book would return explaining how it was a masterpiece because of it. Think about it. By the way even though it's all a matter of opinion, numbers don't lie. It sold millions of copies for a reason"
5,A gem.,"This is probably the best RPG that ever has and ever will be released. I've had it since it's release in 1997 and beat it several times and I plan to again. It just doesn't get old. The graphics are still great, but a little outdated of course because technology is getting better. But it still looks pretty. The battle system is the best of any of the Final Fantasy games, even the newer ones. In fact, I think that the battle system of FF7 is the best of any RPG. The music composition is great as well, even if it is just one guy on a synthesizer. It's great. Let's see; the gameplay is perfect, the music is perfect, the battle system is perfect, the character's are loveable, and the best part is...the story. This game is truly a classic and I recommend it to collectors and gamers alike."
1,rubbish,"This game is a complete waste of any ones time. It suffers greatly from lack of graphics. This game would have been alot better had they put on Atari graphics rather than ""try"" to make the characters somewhat real. Square did a better job in Final Fantasy VIII with graphics. I really hate this game, it was quite boring and mundane. I'd rather recommend you to sleep instead of playing this disasterous trash."
4,"eh, it's pretty good..","The graphics are great, sound Track is excellent. A good plot. everything good except a little things. One: the extra bosses, Ruby and Emerald Weapons are made EXTREMELY tough, you need to get all this great materia and master it to beat them, they are tougher than the final boss. Two: the final boss is also Tough, really tough; GOD LIKE!!! Three: a main character DIES on the FIRST DISK!"
4,"A decent game, but a slip from its predecessors","While being an excellent RPG, it is not up to the caliber of the originals, especially III(US)/VI. There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value. Its a onetimer. I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again. There were too many things that were too tedious in the game, namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX). Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff, ie. master materia, just isn't worth it. As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest. Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets, but only really worth playing once."
5,"best final fantasy game, best of rpg games!","ok if ur a final fantasy fan, or rpg fan i highly recomend this game to anyone of these games. im not going to write anything about this game besause if i did it would take all day to read. so therefore ff7 is the best of ff games period and of all rpgs. i highly recomend this game to anyone."
5,The Coolest Game ever!,"Final Fantasy VII is the coolest game ever! It is a 3 disk set and has not so good graphics if you have a PS2 and a 70"" screen T.V. Like me. But it is an awsome game! I promise you. And also very challenging game. Also, the first disk comes first, disk 2, and 3 are continuations of the game."
5,Final Fantasy VII- One of the best RPGs ever made!!!,"I am a huge RPG fan. Since I was little i have watched, played, and talked about video games. But, I can never stop talking about Final Fantasy VII. As soon as I finished it the first time I started over again. The creator of final fantasy series is trully a geniuess. This game made me cry, laugh, and sometimes as with all games, even curse. But still it has made me a much better gamer and I can't wait for Final Fantasy 10 to be realesed. Of course I'll probably have to murder someone to get my hands on it. This trully is one of the best games ever!!! Me and i'm sure others hope that their never is really a Final Fantasy."
1,Lamest final fantasy EVER,lamest story ever in a game. i think pac-man has a better plot. sephiroth a great villan??....ive seen a better villan in Pong. just overall a very lame game
5,The Best Game Ever!,"Once I played Final Fantasy VII I was great at it is my best game I have. I like the music, I like the graphics, and I like the story of the game."
3,Good but no FF3(FF6),"Overall this is a good RPG. It adds a new element in the graphics department to the FF series. Compared to the FF3 the graphics are amazing. The story is great also but you'll have to play the game to find that out. The only thing i don't like is that squaresoft took out classic FF concepts. There is no more armor just a little bracelet thingy. I think that buys armor for all parts of the body is more entertaining than FF7's armor. You have to buy or find all your spells instead of earning them by gaining experience. I think that this is a very good game but it does not compare to FF2(FF4) or FF3(FF5). They were the last great RPGs, along with Chrono Trigger, to come along. FF7 just doesn't beat them."
5,Completely Awesome,"This game has good graphics and the storyline is amazing. This is the best Playstation game I've ever bought. I still play it now, even though it's old. I've even got some of my friends hooked. If you don't mind playing hours and hours of a great game, you should definitely buy this."
5,"""I don't care where, Cloud, Just stop it!""","I love this game. It is absolutely THE BEST vg i have ever played.Follow the life of Cloud Strife, an ex-soldier who joins AVALANCHE, a club who is full of crime fighting agents such as Tifa, Barret and Yuffie. One time on a dangerous mission, he meets Aeris, a flower girl from the slums.they THEN set out on an adventure to defeat Shinra!"
5,one of the best RPGS ever!,"U people who diss it r bloody mad! 'ohhh, its got bad graphics' u say, well it hasn't but it did come out in 1997 so of course they r a bit dated but who cares? U will say FFX has got rubbish graphics in a few years time so what does it matter!? The story is great as are the characters, it has one of the best bad guys ever and is alot better than FFX(not that i didnt like FFX) U have got to give it a chance, like alot of rpgs they start slow but then build up and boy does this story get good. RPGS are more than graphics, the story and gameplay are the most important aspecs.People giving it one star are bloody muppets. Nuff said mate.Play it."
5,THE great ps1 rpg!,"This game is amazing. The plot rocks, The battle system is perfect, The characters are endearing, It's just flat-out fun to play! I'm telling you this is a must have game if you like rpgs. And if you don't like rpgs buy this game anyway! It rocks! So it doesn't have a pause function. Big deal! This game blowes away all other ps1 rpgs like a tumbleweed in a hurricane! Take a tip from me. Go buy Final Fantasy VII. it's the best rpg on the ps1!"
5,This Game Rules!!,"Final Fantasy VII is just an incredible game, and is currently my favorite Playstation game. What can I say? With a compelling, intricately designed storyline, awesome, amazingly detailed graphics, INCREDIBLE music, and a deep, innovative magic system involving a substance called materia, this game is absolutely fantastic. If you don't already own it, than go out and get it now. Don't worry about renting it first; there is no need. Final Fantasy VII is that good."
5,Brings tears to my eyes!,"This is a must have game for any gamer. It is the holy grail among RPGs. This is one of the few games i can pick up any time and still enjoy playing it. It has all the things a good RPg should have- a good story, a good battle system, and most importantly for me good characters. It is ,in my opinion and many others, the best in the series and the most fun to play.Even if you dont like RPGs you should still play this game- thats how good it is. And if you do like RPGs and you dont have this game you should slap yourself. Bottom line- play this game you wont regret it. It is an adventure you wont soon forget-guaranteed."
5,"yowies, it's the greatest game of all time!!","It two words BUY IT.While that alone should be enough, I guess I'll tell you why.This is THE greatest game EVER made. It surpasses the mighty Metal Gear Solid, commonly thought to be the greatest, by a million miles. It also wastes any other FF, RPG, Game, Movie, Book, anything!I've finished it nine times. I'm yet to be bored. I reckon I never will be....."
4,Final Fantasy 7,"Quite possibly one of the best RPG out there for the time. It's great if you can play throught the pain at the beginning, as It becomes much better as you go on. The game does lack a little in design of the characters, but it was excellent for the time. A pure classic. Two Thumbs up. Final Fantasy 7 launches probably what is the greatest enemy in all of the RPG even in the Video game world. Seperioth. The game has many challanges, and not to mention trying to Get the GOLD CHOOCOBO. Huh, Good luck, and if you like RPGs, your bound to love it. Five Stars, Pure classic."
5,Amazing!,"All I can say about this game is WOW. Ive beaten this game twice(and Im NOT saying its easy,you need to work for it, and it PAYS off!)...but im never bored with it, I still play it! And ive had this game since '97! I find it much better than the new FF games in so many ways. For one i love the story line, its so much better than FF10 and stuff which i found very, very...well, bad to be honest(*In my opinion of course*) There are so many characters too. I believe there is 10 playable characters, and one arch enemy...and if youve never played the game-than you should buy it and find out even more. To sum it up this game is fun and exciting to the very end. Personally I think all FF lovers out there should own the best rpg ever-Final Fantasy VII"
5,FF7 is the reason I purchased a Playstation,"Except for the ""Legend of Zelda"" titles, I had never experienced such depth and breadth of a gaming experience before FF7. It was indeed the reason I got a Playstation. I had never even been a fan of true RPG games until a friend recommended this to me. The first time I put the disc in the console I (and my non game-playing dad) was blown away by the characters, play quality, plot, and of course graphics and sound. I spent one summer playing this game religiously, searching for every secret and nuance that make this game one of the best ever produced. I appreciate games that can really get me involved or transport me to within the game world itself. FF7 is one of the few that has done so."
5,"Final Fantasy VII May Be Dated, But It's An Incredible Experience!","Granted, I played this game when it first came out and I was 12 years old, but I'm sure that if YOU are a little open-minded, and have the patience to read every bit of dialogue (as opposed to hearing voice-actors these days, which makes me not want to play anything past Final Fantasy X), you will definately have a rewarding, immersive, personal, unforgettable gaming experience. The story is great, the music is ANGELIC, the Materia system can't be matched, and the side-quests will keep you busy for MONTHS. Final Fantasy VII is one of the most beautiful and pure gaming experiences. I hope many more continue to enjoy it for years to come."
5,Simply Phenomenal.,"I bought this game back in 1997 or so when it was released and i was just hooked, this is without a doubt the greatest game (not just RPG) of all time, everything about it the story, gameplay, music and graphics(graphics were great for the time and are still great now). Anyone who criticises this game because of the grapics clearly doesnt know what games are about, gameplay is much more important than eye candy. Saying graphics are more important than gameplay is like saying CGI is more important in movies then the actual story/plot. Anyway this game is more than a game, its a legend."
5,"Not FFVI, but it's still great","Final Fantasy VII is a great game. Everything about is great. The only thing I dind't like was the ending. It was too easy. To play for 80 hours to get to the end and use one summon materia once to kill the final boss was disappointing (even though I loved the final boss music). The weapons are MUCH harder. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Even though I still think FFVI is the best game ever made (Chrono Trigger is the second best game ever), this is a very worthy addition to the FF series and one of the best RPG's ever made."
3,pretty good game,"I excpected a lot from this game when I started playing it. Many people had told me how good it was. After plaing FF9 for 4 days and 40 hours, I was anticipating a very good game. I was almost dissapointed. People will probably bash me for saying this, but it was a mediocre game. The story is average, the cinematics are ok, and the graphics aren't that great. The gameplay is by far its best feature. Although it was made a while back, there were a few fundamental things they could have done to make the graphics better, like connect the peoples forearm to upperarm a bit better. They all look like popeye... and that should have been toned down a bit. Also, the things people say in that game are dumb sometimes. It's an average ps game... i would reccomend it, but only if you have played the other FF games and liked them."
3,A dark and brilliant story but lacking heart and soul,"FFVII is a rather mixed bag. While featuring an excellent story (that borrows more or less from FFVI), most of the characters are shallow and can be described in a few words, with the notable exceptions of Sephiroth, Red XIII, Vincent Valentine, and Zack. The story is dark and epic but there's little heart and soul to it. Most of the characters don't really care or have selfish reasons to their quests. The romance fills rushed and it doesn't help that Tifa, the main heroine, is a lifeless and meaningless ploy to get young males to purchase the game. The gameplay can be fun and Materia is a quality system (although out-shined by the Job System of FFV and FFTactics). But the game takes too much AP to level up Materia most of the time. It's a worthwhile expierence and the 2nd disc is an epic tour de force, but the game leaves you feeling a little empty and desiring more substance and heart."
4,One of the greatest RPGs ever.,"This is the rpg that defined all rpgs. The game features graphics that surpassed anything else at the time of its release. The big thing about this game is story. So if your not willing to spend a lot of time (and I mean a lot of time), then this might not be the game for you. But it pays off if you play through the whole thing, leaving you wanting more. Overall, there's really only one small complaint that I have about this game, and that's its super-deformed characters. Let me explain, whenever you are not in a battle or a full-motion-video (FMV), your character appears as a small, stocky semblance of a human being. Minor gripe, I know, but it needed to be said. Newcomers to the RPG genre will find it easy to pick up (it teaches you everything) and old-school RPers won't be disappointed either. Basically I'm telliing you that if you've got some time and want a story that's gonna make you laugh and cry, then buy this game!"
5,final(?) fantasy 7,THE best rpg you can get. it takes a bout 1 hour to get the hang of. not easy but not hard. out of all the final fantasy games it has the best carictors but the only problem is that your carictars have small bodys. exsept for the fights and movies
5,My all time favorite game,Yes i've played this game and it's my alltime favorite. I mean the graphics are outstanding and tifa is the hottest girl in the game.
5,FINAL FANTASY VII (Greatest Game Yet),"This game really rocks! Maybe it's because of the cute yellow birds also known as Chocobos, or maybe it's because of their fantastic movies. Their battle systems are easy to keep up with and I like how they introduced their characters. This truely is the greatest game I've ever played."
5,This is an awsome game!!!,"For all of you FF lovers. This is a great game. Join Barrett, Tifa, Red, Aeris, Cid, and two secret players (Yuffie and Vincent),along with Cloud. Explore a whole world with a team of three. Your enemy is Sephiroth. This is a long game but very worth while."
1,master of puppets????? metallica???????,"dont get the analogy there, this is for video games btw. This game has got to be the biggest letdown in graphics ever. i can play nes games with no complaints about graphics whatsoever, but this game just bites. the story is ment for kids too, which is not bad, but as an ""post-teen"" young adult, the story is a joke."
1,the graphics stink. Period.,"why is this game so bad? because the graphics are not bad, but they are TOTALLY HERONDOUS!!!! its no wonder the whole team that worked on Final Fantasy VII was fired. Yep, thats right, and no one here will admit it. its a little known fact. So dont buy this game, play FF6 or FF8 instead, both of those are SUPERB FF titles."
1,Major hot air,"this game has got to be the most overhyped game in recent history. its so average. soooooooooooooooooooooo average. have u guys played xenosaga??? i think Albedo is the utimate villian, he makes sephiroth look like a dweeb. LOL! final fantasy 8 is the best on the original playstation. did i say that ff7 sucks?? oh, it sucks!"
1,stop the overhype!!!!!!!!!!,"i have to agree, with previous reviewers, this game is overhyped. i like the final fantasy series, but this game is just plain lame. i cant belive they might make a sequal to this game for the portable playstation coming out, but at least it wont be on the ps2, i dont think it deserves to come out on the PS2 platform. ff6 is still the best."
1,My first game in this series and I think it's the worst RPG in existance.,"This game's so boring it makes you doubt your intelligence, it also has the worst ending in the series."
1,mix of legos and vomit,this game looks like moving legos and the story is pretty much a bucket o' vomit. worst final fantasy game E-V-E-R.
1,O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D.,"honestly, this game is so overrated, not to mention, boring to play, not recommended."
1,"oh, this is supposed to be the greatest game ??","um....the story is very predictable, the translation really is bad, the story is bland, the characters are ok, and the ending is so so bad! i mean, really, after finishing a game and devoting 50+ hours, u get this very lame ending. i wouldnt buy this game. i wasnt moved nearly as much as i was with final fantasy 8, now theres a game! if i put the recent final fantasies in order from greatest to worst, this would be the worst. .........."
1,oh please.........,"the object in writing a review is to inform others of the overall aspect of the game, not to defend it like as if it was part of your heart, which is what alot of people do with this game. this game is extremely overhyped. i finished the game, the ending sucks, the story sucks,,, overall disappointing game, i felt it was a chore to beat this game. I HIGHLY recommend final fantasy viii if u want an earlier ps final fantasy game. And do urself a favor and dont buy this game."
1,a game that is so bad,"I dont like this game and have to say that alot of people do give it 5 stars just cuz it was the first final fantasy on playstation. the graphics are very ugly, they look like big balloon faced cartoons. thier hands are bubbles and they had to make each character look COMPLETLEY different to be able to tell whos who in the game screen, (its that bad of graphics). Odin looks like a elf with horns, titan looks like a giant mad man, and they had to make 3........YES......3 forms of bahamut, those are just some examples of how desperately lacked originallity. the summons in final fantasy 8 are so much original and better. This game is more for kids. final fantasy 8 delt with a more mature theme and more serious looking characters as well as overall game. I highly DONT recommend playing this game, if ur gonna start playing a final fantasy game, start with Final Fantasy 8 instead :D."
1,"oh boy, this game is the most overhyped game","Boy, let me tell you, this games is seriously bad. The characters suck, Cloud is the worst hero in any FF games. I dont see how you kids like this game? I have played Final Fantasy 8 and its so superior to this game. I even hated FF9 and i still think its better than this game. Very boring.............................VERY BORING GAME. Worst Final Fantasy game in the series, hands down."
4,This is where i started to play FF,"FF7 was my first game to play from FF. Great graphics, very mundane story, and the mini games were very well worth it. This game should be added towards your FF collection."
4,Weird,The graphics were okay but gave me a headache after a while. The story was shaky and the end totally confused me. Other than that it was okay.
5,One of the best RPG's of all time,"It has an awesome storyline and you won't get bored with all that mushy love [junk] from FF8. Just play the game, it's good."
5,Final Fantasy Rocks!!!,"This Final Fantasy lives uo to its name. The story is great, the graphic are great, Everything is great. This is a true Final Fantasy RPG."
4,Hmmm,"I would like to say that I have played this game, and I loved it. I have fond memories playing it, and am dissapointed in the 1 star reveiw. I noticed that all the 1 star reviews are all submited near or on the same date. Somebody obivously has alot of time on ones's hands and thought that it would be good to ruin this game for others. Give one 1 star review and be done, keep your thoughts to yourself and leave this classic alone. However I will give that person the graphics, they do suck, but I can deal with that."
5,to all the people playing FF VII for the first time,"alright, first of all i think that all you people who gave this game 1 star are expecting the abilities of a new release PS2 game in this old school original playstation game. I'm just assuming that this is the first time you've played Final Fantasy VII. of coarse the graphics suck, by todays standards, but back when this was a new release they were revolutionary. But i am giving this game 5 stars becuase it is one ofthe most engrossing storys of any RPG to date, has characters you can really grow attached to, and virtually revolutionized the RPG world. Needless to say if it hadn't been for this game RPG's would be NOTHING like they are today, or perhaps nothing at all."
4,more HYpE!,"awesome, tubular game, bra! no this one's definitely a keeper...but i don't see why it is regarded as the jeez-christ of ff's. the graphics are neutral (not that that really matters ha!) the gameplay and storyline are mondo, but it just doesn't rank up there with de jesus---it's a rad game. buy it, play it, make love to it"
2,Boring Boring Boring and Overrated.,"An ""OK"" game. It was groundbreaking when it came out, but it's a game that outlived its welcome. The biggest reason why this game is still considered the greatest is because of how innovative it was. There is no denying that. However, the gameplay is difficult. You WILL get lost. You WILL get confused. It's inevitable. There's no aids to helping you if you're lost. I've actually had to start the game over twice because what was supposed to be happening never did. It's an alright game if you're bored. But there are WAY better RPG's on the PS1. Legend of Dragoon, for example."
4,Not as good as Final Fantasy 9,This game is OK but not near as good as FF9. FF9 has better graphics. The characters look like dolls. The cut scenes have good graphics. If you want this game get it for a cheap price or get FF9. If your a big Final Fantasy buy it but if not I don't think you should get it. I think you should buy FF9 instead.
1,can definitely keep the cups warm,"When me and my husband purchased these cup coolers we thought they would come assembled, but to our surprise they didnt. We were terribly dissapointed in the lack of cooling degrees it had. Our drinks do not even chill, but remain usually at room temperature. I dont recommend these cups."
1,SO GOOD!!!!!!!,"THIS GAME IS SO GOOD THATS WHY IM GIVING IT ONLY 1 STAR BECAUSE IT IS THE ONE GAME TO CHANGE MY LIFE, I MARRIED A GIRL NAMED TIFA AND MY FRIENDS NAMES ARE YUFFIE, CID, VINCENT, AND BARRELL, IM SO COOL CUZ IM SO INTO THIS GAME AND YOURE NOT, THIS GAME CHANGED MY LIFE SO IM GIVING IT ONE STAR!!!"
1,Very misleading,These pants are NOT what theyre sizes say. i ordered a medium and got a large with a medium tag on it. this happended to my sister too. dont get these pants. what i did was go to walmart and picked up some very similar ones.
1,"Now, Does this sound a *_WEE_* Far-fetched????","A guy with an abnormaly large sword and 2 Magical Orbs (Materia) trying to stop the Most powerful company in the world (ShinRa)AND the Unhumanly powerful Sephiroth? HELL NO! I dumped my SNES and turned on this and went like Dis---------> *o* Purely Awesome. If you've got a PSX, Go get it. I wrote a 1 star so you would read it."
5,The ULTIMATE RPG!,"Oh great and powerful Squarsoft, we are not worthy of such excellence. This is literally the best RPG ever. An intricate storyline and characters that you will grow to love and finally undrstand at the end. The music is beautiful and the movie sequences are amazing. I have never ever experienced an RPG that kept me so interested. If you want an RPG buy FFVII, the best RPG ever!"
3,NOOOOOOOOOOOO!,"I bought this game yesterday and when I got home I started playing with it with no problems. I lost to a boss and I had to restart since I don't have a Playstation memory card. I loved the game, and when I started a new game again it started out fine. After Cloud talks to Barrot I press ""O"" and Cloud doesn't move at all. He is supposed to look up to the reactor but he doesn't do anything. I pressed every button on my controller and I reseted it about 15 times. The same thing happens. I can see the other animations working but Cloud never moves. This is kind of odd for a PlayStation and there are no scratches on it."
5,ONE OF THE BEST!!!,"This is by far one of the BEST Final Fantasy games I've played. I HIGHLY reccommend this game to RPG lovers. If you like Final Fantasy, you wil LOVE this game. BUY IT NOW!!!!"
4,BAD GAME,There r only two words to describe this game and that is BAD GAME!!!!!!! The graphics r terrible!!! and the gameplay is also BAD so for all the people who think this is the best game ever grow up this game is the worse. I've played better games on the atari. Also anyone who purchased this game when it first came out got ripped off big time. I don't know who would ever say this is the best game ever! By the way i did beat this game and I still can't understand why people would say it's the best game ever!! To tell you the truth i think this game is a complete and terrible waste of money!!! I sure am glad the store i bought it from let me return it to get a better game!!!!!!!!!! Now to end this review with these words that describe the game to the bone. This game is the worst game ever made and that's what the title for the game should be!!!!!!!!!
5,ALL OF YOU WHO GIVE THIS GAME A BAD RATING SUCK,actually i am 14 and i didnt feel like logging in to write this. It is an awsome game with a great story line and many plot twists. it is really wxcicing to play and anyone who even thinks that thry like RPGs should buy it even if the graphics arent that great. It was made in the 1990's for petes sake. but it is still on of the greatist games ever made.
2,FFVII,"Final fantasy 7 is an okay game for me, I'd recommend legend of legaia. A much more easier, and less complicated game. I couldnt even get past the first level in ffvii! I needed to buy a strategy guide to walkthrough all the levels until I had finally got to the last level. Instead of ffvii, i would recommend people to buy Legend of legaia.. A great game and great graphics!"
4,The Ultimate Game 2! (1st being final fantasy 8),"Another breathtaking squaresoft game. Sepiroth is dead or is he? It all starts when you join a group in the slums called AVALANCHE and try and destroy reactors which an evil company called SHINRA are using to suck the life out the planet. Though when Cloud (the main man!) meets a girl called Areis he falls in love with her. When she is taken by SHINRA he finds she is an ancient, the last one! He goes to the main building to rescue her and finds out his arch enemy Sepiroth is still alive though he was killed years ago. The team decide to go after him. That was just a basic plot for it, buy and feel the story come out at you, perfect characters with real personalites. A totally breathtaking story and plot."
5,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!,"THIS WAS THE BEST GAME EVER. The storyline was absolutely excellent. I played about 80 hours on one game and I have started 3 new games. the music was great. I never found the game to be boring (except during the tedious random battles :)).The caracters were very well developed. the graphics weren't that great,but they were in 1997 when it was made.If you like rpg's and even if you don't you should get this game. it's well worth the time and money."
5,the BEST rpg EVER,"ok let me just say THIS GAME IS THE BEST. its the best rpg ever and this is better then any other rpg around . the characters are cool ""i like Tifa the best *_* "". the sound is great like when you fight the bosses and the graphics are ok, there even better when you use a summon like nights of the round. HOW can you not love this game!!!!!!!!!!"
5,It was a new era...a new platform...and a Fantasy.,"This is the ""must-have"" of the series. Skip VIII, get IX and X, and throw yourself into the mists of time to rekindle that old flame called Final Fantasy VII. This game brought the non-hardcore gamers and hardcore gamers together. (much like Star Trek IV did with non trekkies, trekkers...) The CG effects left a mark on the people who played it and introduced Final Fantasy to the mainstream. I never played any FF before this and wasn't the least bit interested, but, I tried it...the rest is history. The Statue of Mario was replaced in '97. One last thing, don't let the release year fool you...VII stands as outstanding graphically as it did then and weaves a tale that will still amaze."
4,Play it,"If you are a fan of RPGs, then you must play this game. The story is moving, the characters are very deep, the gameplay is very fun, and the graphics are very good (considering it was made in 1997)."
5,Oh how much I love this game... It actually brings a tear to my eye!,"This is the best RPG ever. Sure, the graphics aren't up to today's standards and that may turn some people off. (My brother, for instance, likes to make fun of the fact that they have square hands.) But it really has a wonderful storyline and I fell in love with the characters right away.I guess one other thing some people will not like is the random battle scenes. Admittedly, this can grow tiring, but the rest of the game is so good that I still give this game 5 stars!It is definitely a classic."
5,Best Game,"This is without a doubt the best videogame of all time. The graphics rock, the music is phenomonal, and the gameplay is amazing. When I think of what an RPG should be consisted of the answer is Final Fantasy VII. If you are new to RPG's and were thinking of Final Fantasy VIII I would definitely recommend VII. There is just so much you can do in this game besides just following the story line. The story line itself had me emotional it gets so intense."
1,ff8 is better,"this game is overrated, the graphic suck, the story is lame buy ff8 it's way better and at a way better price....."
1,Utter Dismay,As one reviewer pointed out there are a few pearls of wisdom (the science of a good gravy) in this otherwise wordy and fairly patronizing book. I was looking for a book to explain the small nuances of how to improve a particular recipe or tweak an ingredient to bring out its fullest potential but I what I found was pretty much a garbled and condescending chemistry lesson -- and not a very good one at that.
1,Worst Final Fantasy Game,"I am a huge RPG fan and have played all of the Final Fantasy games, and FFVII (7) is the worst. The graphics are TERRIBLE, the story is long and boring, and the music (aside from the battle theme) is nothing special. I know it is often considered to be the best FF, but I just cannot see why other than it being the first FF for Playstation and thus the first one most FF fans played. I suggest skipping this one and playing FFIX FFX and FFXII (9 10 and 12) first."
1,The King of Linear!,"I hate this entire series for it's linearness, and stopped playing them when I got 8. All I've seen after 7 are just remakes of the same story, over and over again. 9 isn't, but it's just stupid.Seriously, if you're over 14 and still playing FF, you need to grow some pubes and buy a game with blood in it (I highly recommend Fallout 2 to those with the meager amount of brains to conquer it)That's enough for a game I don't respect (the rest of the series gets no stars)"
1,WORST FINAL FANTASY GAME EVER,"This is the worst Final Fantasy ever done. Why? Play every FF from 1 to 6, you will see a progression in the depht of the gameplay, the characters, the story lines. In FF5 you had the job system, in FF6, you had FOURTEEN characters to choose from and all of them with a deep personality, in FF6 you had to use eight and in the final dungeon TWELVE characters at the same time. When you buy this game, you get a ""main"" character with punky hair and who never says a word, you can only use *three* characters, the stroy line is so complex that nobody knows what the heck happens at the end. OK, the story is not really complex, it's just confusing and pointless, it happens that the game designers had to rewrite the story three times in order to make room for the polygonal graphics, and then include enough eyecandy for the Sony/Squre executives.The end result is a dull game with no meat, no substance, no fun"
5,best game ever,"WOW! this is truly the BEST GAME EVER. if you're going to buy any game this year, buy this one. full of charecters and storyline. just go to the store right now and buy this game!"
5,Amazing RPG!,"I have played many role-playing games, but none even come close to the quality withen this game. The unique and twisting story will suck you in immediately, with it's plot and deep moral, and the music was another one of Nobuo Uematsu's masterpieces. After meeting each character you will feel as if they are right next to you. Also, do not think that the in-game graphics are all you see of the characters, because you'll love the battle sequences and the fmvs (Full Motion Video).I hope that this review was helpful to you.Thanks for reading!"
4,Notice to buyers: Don't bother if there's no original art/manual/case.,"This review is more about sellers than the game itself. I was just looking through and found people selling versions of FFVII without the original case, artwork or manual for upwards of $50. If you're going to spend this much money for it, don't bother buying from cheap sellers trying to rip you off. It's only collectible if it is in a ready for retail condition, i.e. - not ""discs only"".Don't waste your money. Get the package deal and who knows, in five years or so it could be worth double!"
5,The most amazing game ever,"This game is the best game ever made. The graphics aren't that bad, the storyline is great, the gameplay is great, and it offers hours of fun.The game is massive and somewhat detailed. I would definitely recommend it to anybody. However, $80 is a bit too expensive, in my opinion."
4,Great game,"This is a truly great game, some people feel that it's the best of the series, I wouldnt go that far, but I'm still quite pleased. The only problem is that there is no objectives list, and no map markers for objectives, so you really have to pay attention to whats being said by the characters in the story or you'll have no idea where to go. And of course, if you stop playing for a month or whatever you might need a walkthrough to get back on track lol."
3,Give me tactics or give me chess,"FF 7 is good but give me FF tactics anyday. The job system in tactics is the best by far of any game. Now, if we can find a storyline for the next? tactics, we can get down to some serious RPGing. And by the way, deep six the voices in these games. Do we really need them?"
3,Decent game. FF8 is miles better in every way,Final Fantasy 7 is a great game. It has a decent storyline with good characters but it is absolutely terrible compared to the mighty FINAL FANTASY 8. 9 & 7 aren't bad but they are nowhere near the same standard.
2,Disappointing,"I *tried* to give this game 3 stars, but I just can't find it in me to do so. I expected this game to be so much more than it is. The graphics (even considering the time period) are blocky looking. Thanks to all the beautiful backgrounds, you often cannot tell where your character can/should walk. And the whole Aeris thing (those of you who have played will understand) leaves you feeling as though there should have been more to it that the game designers forgot to put in. I spent most of the game thinking she would be able to come back to life. Sad to say, it seems that Square sacrificed story line and plot to make this game. Given a choice, I'd rather play Final Fantasy 2 or 3 for the SNES."
3,So much potential but too juvenile,"Essentially all the characters in this game are 15 year olds. The FF7 world, while huge and imaginative, is populated by mentally 15 year old adults. Which is fine if you are that age but once you get a little older, it really takes away from the immersiveness of the game to see people act so silly and for the humor to be so juvenile. Especially in a game like this that has such a dark and serious theme. The plot is great but is just poorly implemented, it just never really comes together in a way that really ties the game together."
5,This even beats Pokemon...,"This game is amazing. I finally got to play it a week ago and I was shocked how much I loved it. It has a very good story line, above average graghic, great movie scences, and an awsome battle set-up for an RPG sicne it uses limit breaks, and the Active Time Bar System. This has got to be the greatest game I've ever played and I'm a video game finatic. I just have 1 thing to say: Final Fantasy VII is worth the money and is a great game!"
5,do the bad reveiwere have brain damage?,"I loved this game. it has one of the most innovative battle systems I have ever played (next to ffX). if they would stop personally attacking the characters they might have a greater apreciation for how good this game actually is. I do have to admit that the characher development is indeed inferior to that of final fantasy X, but if you get that behind you it is an excellent game, vastly superior to final fantasy X-2."
5,hi,thiz game roxorxs get it now while you still can cause it is the best game evar!cloud is so cool and aeris just rocks and red therteen ho could forgit about him1?defintly the best game 4 the play station. get it now!
1,BORING!!!!,"My boyfriend told me to play this game and after him bugging and bugging me i did and i was totally bored. My first final fantasy was final fantasy 8 and i really like that game. this game sucks though. Aeris(*Aerith) dies before u can even do any of her cool moves, whats up with that???? and the graphics are a pain in the bottom!!! I still dont get the whole story, and i did finish the darn game, but it sucks."
1,so overhyped!,"Cons1. The character design is horrible2. Plot is lacking3. magic is an annoying time consuming waste of time, made solely for making the game twice as long.4. No equipment means nothing interesting to find in dungeons.5. No treasures In dungeons, just walk through a straight path fighting boring battles.6. Same old battle system7. Leveling up is pointless8. Leveling up makes you loose money.9. There's nothing to spend your money on anyway.10. The graphics attactual (...). Look at those pixelly legs.11. Far too linear12. Costs to much13. farting is funner than the actual game.14. The easiest game in the series. The easiest game I have ever played. Didn't come close to losing once.15. Pressed the ""fight"" key 6 times to kill last boss...no, no healing either.Pros: It has some good music.The first 2 hours are actually fun."
4,FF7 review,The overall gameplay works fine but there have been minor lagging in cutscenes overall I am pleased with this game and it's one of the best games ever created you should definently check this one out if your a FF fan.
1,very immature story line,"after playing ff8, i played this game. i was not impressed. after playing the mature themed ff8 game, i played this almost ""pokemon"" friendly themed game. the characters are all cartoony and super deformed with big heads, and poorly rendered, might i add, and with little puny bodies. the dialogue is laughable, very ""silly"" and falls wayyyyyyyyy short of being taken seriously. I was so disappointed by this, i like the more serious tones that were used in ff8, ffx, and ff eleven."
1,the real review,graphics are bad. the controlling is bad. the story is bad. the characters are pretty good. the dialogue is cheese-friendly-bad. the plot is bad. sephiroth is lame. cloud is lamer. this game is lame.
1,HOLLIE MOLLIE!,"there are some games that u buy just to have, and this is one of those games, i wanted to just complete my final fantasy game collection so i bought it, but it sucks, is so lame and the graphics are really bad. theres no analog controll capability eighter, so the controls really suck too. overall a bad game"
1,Final Fantasy VII = Lamest game of all-time!!!,"Final Fantasy 7 is a work of crap. The worst in the long series and a dont buy this game for any rpg fans who don't already have this game. The game brings you to a lame world troubled by it's new found effcient power-source which has resulted in an increase in lameness. But it's other effects aren't yet visible to our sissi, Cloud a mercenary who is hired by a resistance group to destroy this new form of energy. As the boring story progress' you find out more about each character and the story becomes even more boring with a new evil and old friend stirring things up. You better not get this game. Trust me!"
5,OTR Bargain,"A very good deal, especially for those who are not sure which shows may be of interest to them. The booklet is excellent and contributes to the enjoyment of the programs. Many hours of entertainment for a very small investment."
5,This was the absolute most amazing book yet.,"Tobias is flying to the gas station when all the suddun he finds himself flying over the woods behind Cassie's barn. Then he finds he must help 2 Hork Bajar get to freedom. The Ellimist says if he frees the Hork bajar he will give him what he wants. He gets the Hork Bajar to freedom, but Tobias just gets his morphing power back, just like he wanted. Then the Ellimist takes him back and lets him aquire himself."
3,"This book is good, but not KAA's best","This book wasn't really good. I like books that can keep me reading because of all the action. This book didn't have that. It kept on talking about how Tobias' life used to be, and how he wanted to be human. Maybe it's just me, but this book wasn't that good. It was O.K., but not my favorite."
5,THIS IS SO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL.,"I HAVE READ THE SAMPELE CHAPTER OF #13 IT IS S**T HOT I THINK ANIMORPHS RULE. LONG LIVE JAKE, RACHEL, TOBAIS, AX, CASSIE & MARCO BY DLM"
3,This one does not cut it.,"I'm sorry. I read it once, and that is the only time I ever read it. I love to hear the story from a hawk's eye view, but the ending did NOT cut it. I mean, come on, it ended way to quickly and not in an very exciting way. Even the story was fine, but it is still far less from excellent when compared to the first one."
2,"There are hardly any dull Animorphs books, but this was one.","I thought the middle was boring. I like more action. In this one, they spent the whole book just trying to rescue the hork-bajir. It didn't get good until way towards the end when Tobias got his morphing power back."
5,#13 The Change,"I am so glad that Tobias has his morphing powers back. The Ellimist is a liar. Tobias wanted to be human again but instead he got just the powers to morph from his hawk body. This is a very good book, but it would have been better if he was human."
5,Greatest EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11,I think this is the greatest book ever! I agree that it isn't the Elimist but Elfangor's sprit.I's just my opinon
5,THE GREATEST Tobias BOOK EVER! ! ! ! !,"ANY 1 WITH COMON SEANS WOULD AGREE WITH ME,Tobias IS THE CUTEST ANIMORPH.& THEY WOLDN'T CALL Tobias's BOOKS BORING."
1,I don't like this book,I did not like this book because it was boring. It had weird words and annoying names. Tobias had an evil cousin.
1,Don't buy San Disk products!,I bought a Sansa MP3 player and the battary lasted about a year. When I tried to get a replacement I found out that no one makes them. I tried calling Sansa but they put me through to a fullfillment company who couldn't help me. I tried calling back but no one would help me resolve the issue. Buy their products with caution...you're on your own if something goes wrong.
1,Another bad battery,The original battery in my Sansa e280 quit holding a charge (no life after less than 2 hours of use) so I ordered a replacement battery. The replacement battery will not hold a charge either. I've tried charging on two different computers and on a car charger. Either I've had two bad batteries or something is wrong with the player itself.
5,Excellent,I had no trouble opening my Sansa thanks to the included screwdriver. The new battery works like new with a good charge.
1,Battery Life?,"The battery worked inatially, but it's life was only about a month and I'm not an mp3 heavy duty user. I've been trying to recharge it for the past 2 weeks with no success."
5,A wonderful treatise on Practical Vedanta,"This book is simply wonderful. It gives a great insight into what the term RELIGION means with context to INDIA. From a novice to the scholar (of Hinduism or Comparative Religion) - all will read this book with rapt attention from cover to cover. This book is actually a compilation of the discourses on the GOSPEL OF SRI RAMAKRISHNA delivered by the author. However, it is enriched by the references to various religious texts and their relevance when viewed in the light of the teachings of a modern saint as SRI RAMAKRISHNA, a Hindu saint from India (1836 - 1886).The author was a monastic who lived a life based on the principles of Practical Vedanta and was a living example of a person who had attained the highest spiritual knowledge. His other writings on the Upanishads and the series of editorials he wrote for the Bulletin of The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture is a treasure-trove for the student of VEDANTA, HINDUISM or COMPARATIVE RELIGION."
5,Don't be confused by hate!,"For any true loyal flash programmer/designer this is the update to get. Major improvement from MX, and MX04. Dreamweaver 8 starting to look like homesite which is the better. Don't let hate comments confused your choice, this is a well worth upgrade."
4,Dog Health & Nutrition for Dummies,"Overall a good book, although sometimes it is overly basic and at others lacks detail it does have a particularly good first aid section. It is well laid out, clear, and easy to read. Well worth the investment to have on hand as a reference. Definitely a good buy for the first time dog owner!"
4,great gun,good gun for those who don't want too spend that much. battery it comes with sucks but regular 9v works good. I have had no issues with this gun.
5,Went cover to cover in 5 hrs!!,"I found this book in a box sent to my unit when I was in Desert Storm. It was way before the movie was released, so I had no idea what it was about. But once I started, I couldn't put the thing down!! I can't count how many times I have read this. I highly recommend this book!"
4,You Can&#65533;t Judge a Book By Its Covers,"I imagine some people read this book because they were looking for a weekend of thriller escapism and they spotted the mass market paperback on the ""impulse buy"" shelf at the supermarket.I imagine other people read this book because, as they sipped their Chai and scanned the shelves of their favorite bookstore, they spotted the trade paperback and thought it might provide a thoughtful story whose engrossing issues would promote earnest contemplation.The beauty of The Silence of the Lambs is that it rewards both kinds of readers. This book offers plenty of suspense through its well-constructed characters and engaging plot, at the same time providing an unexpected level of depth and subtlety in its exploration of human nature.This is the book that will either ruin or reinvent the thriller genre because it will entirely transform the expectations of readers."
5,A shocker for the ages!,"When alone on a desert island, you'll never long for fava beansafter reading this page turner! Thomas Harris has writtena scary, horrific story that will make you glad you're avegetarian. The young heroine in this novel is an FBIrookie who is enlisted to find a serial killer. The thrillride starts from the first chapter and doesn't let up. LikeHarris' other books, Black Sunday and The Red Dragon,Silence of the Lambs is highly readable with multi dimensionalcharacters. To be enjoyed with your favorite bottle ofChianti!"
4,A real page turner,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a well written book. It appears to have been written so as to become a movie. Each chapter covers a typical seene in the movie. Thus each chapter is short and the book is ideal to read in 10 to 30 minute increments. With a few exceptions and omisions the movie parallels the book. Some parts stretch the imagination and discredit the story's believablity. Lecter escape from jail in an ambulance is a good example. Also any good FBI agent or trainee would call for back up before chasing a serial killer down into a basement. He should have developed some parts better. But, what the heck this is fiction with some fantasy. I am now motivated to read ""The Red Dragon"" and then ""Hannibal."""
5,The book is fabulous and the cassette book is also very good,I love Thomas Harris. He is one of the greatest writers living. But what I would like to say is I was very impressed by the performance of Kathy Bates as narrator of this cassette book. Maybe this cassette book is better than movie.
5,The most amazing book i ever read,"Hanibal Lecter is a truly demonic character, but the reader developes a likeing to him, we find ourselves liking this evil killer, and that is what makes this a hrryfing thriller. We feel for Clarice Starling and feel her fear at dealing with lecter. As a former FBI agent, i found this to be an incredibly belivable book with realistic and semi realistic circumstances. If you liked the movie, read the book its a helluva lot better. The book also developes characters and their inner conflicts a lot better."
3,No Surprises Here,"If you've seen the Silence of the Lambs movie already, you're not missing much as far as the novel is concerned. The movie was quite faithful to the book, so any plot differences between the two are small enough to take all the suspence away for the reader. The extra dialogue isn't nearly as good without Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster saying it. If you have never seen the movie before and are into serial killer/thriller novels, than this is one of the best, and you should read it before you watch the film. If you have seen the movie, than try the other Hannibal Lecter books, the Red Dragon or Hannibal."
5,Book or Movie,"I go back and forth over which treatment of this story I like better, the book or the movie. I have decided finally that though I love Foster's and Hopkin's performances, the book tops the film by a nose. Harris' writing is both beautiful and horrifying, and one can feel the clock ticking as one races to the end of this very scary book that is as much about a recruit coming of age in law enforcement as it is about her catching a killer. In both instances, Starling learns to face her greatest fears and stops the lambs from screaming."
5,The Lambs Will NEVER Be Silent!,I LOVED this book. A great psychological novel of the utmost importance. Dr. Lector is just great and the novel is left open for a sequel. (Which I'm glad was written!) All of the key factors and characters bring it all together for a well written and highly involved book! Great job!!
4,"Not as good as Red Dragon, but still brilliant","The Silence of the Lambs is a classic for serial killer fanatics like myself, Harris went to the trials of real life serial killers like Ted Bundy as research for the book and it shows. Buffalo Bill is more disgusting than the tooth fairy and Lector's role in the book is greatly improved. I read this after watching the movie, so I pretty much knew everything that was going to happen, but that didn't stop it from being one of the more interesting books I've read in the past year. If your considering reading this I'd recommend picking up Red Dragon first because the ending of the last book is spoiled about ten pages into this one."
3,Not as good as Red Dragon,"I finally got around to reading Silence of the Lambs. While it is not as good as Red Dragon, I recommend it to anyone who loves the movies. This is a case where the movies actually outshines the book."
2,Nope.,"This story has a nominally interesting detective adventure which could have done all right as a stand alone.It also has an incredible bunch of dialogue and interaction with Hannibal.But that's it the author should have realized this is not a story, but two stories crammed into one book like mixing oil and water. No-can-do!There is almost no suspense because the action lies with Hannibal who really has nothing to do with the story.The author obviously loves his character Hannibal too much, so he gave him a major portion for an insignificant roll.Which makes for monstrous boredom."
3,"Interresting, But Confusing As Well","This book is based on true events. There once was a psycho path named Hannibal Lecter and Thomas Harris brings him to the Big pages in his novel The Silince Of the Lambs. This is a very Interresting Book. He goese behind the mind of a mad man. i was so confused by this book because i don't know much about police stuff, but it was an okay book.If you Liked This book check out, the Movie, soundtrack, Hannibal & Red Dragon also by Thomas Harris."
1,"Starts with a roar, ends with a bust","Because of all its loose ends the book doesn't convey a sense of high craftsmanship. This makes its pandering to gore all the more unpleasant. Harris is playing all the ropes of a bestseller as they are these days but we miss the music. In fact,"" The Silence etc."" is not a real book but a scenario for the movies or for TV. It reads like one (see the last page!) and it has its depth"
1,I couldn't find the section on leg of lamb,"I was very disappointed as I thought this was cookbook for the preparation of lamb and mutton.However, all was not lost. I purchased a set of plastic surgery scalples and flay my woolly friends here at the farm."
2,Swiftness Can't Overcome Illogic,"Thomas Harris' THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS reads like gangbusters, hurtling from one scene to the next with sure-fire rythym. Unfortunately, the story and charatcers are a complete wash. Clarice Starling is a pasty, uninteresting heroine, devoid of distinctiveness. Basically, for all the attention bestowed upon her, she comes off as nothing more than a young woman who can't get over her haunting childhood. And Buffalo Bill makes for a ridiculous serial killer; there's no insight or alluring texture to this particular killer -- he's simply a sensationalistic boogy man. In RED DRAGON, author Harris brilliantly conceived a fascinating hero and a just-as-fascinating villian for his nerve-jangling tale. Here, we have a generic plot and characters who just aren't worth engaging in. A bust"
4,"GOOD BOOK, BAD ENDING","Silence Of The Lambs is a first rate thriller!! Clarice Starling is an FBI agent who must find the demented serial killer Buffalo Bill, who skins his victims and leaves their bodies in lakes. Locked behind bars is psycho psychitrist ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" Lector who once killed his patients and ate parts of their bodies{Near the beginning of the book you'll find out what he did once to a nurse.} To the FBI it becomes obvious that Lector knows who Buffalo Bill is. Starling must get into Lector's mind first!!!!! After Buffalo Bill abducts Senator Martin's daughter, the FBI imediately sets into action!!!! Can Starling get through Lector to find out the name of Buffalo Bill before time wons out???? This novel is thrilling, but has a poor ending. I have yet to read the new Hannibal novel and Red Dragon, but I'll read them soon!!!"
3,If you're a sucker for detail..,"Then this book is for you!Personally, I found that the book would get highly intriguing when Lecter and Starling were sharing thoughts but its almost like Mr. Harris wanted to lull you to sleep with high detail about whatever it was (say when he injects you with high detail & blandness about Jack Crawford & his wife).If you want to delve deeper than the movie did, then read the book (and you can do that with the sequel, Hannibal).. it gives you more detail about Starling and Lecter than the movie shares. It makes for an interesting read when you've got more detail to work with the next time you watch the movie.And if you're just morbid & looking for psychological depth, have fun!"
5,Thrills and Chills,"My husband turned me onto this book years ago. I read it years after seeing the movie, and let me tell you that the movie does not hold a candle to the book. I was afraid to sleep for weeks! I'm going to save you the details, because by now most people have at least watched the movie. If you love a good thriller (even one as old as this) that scares you sleepless, this is the book for you."
3,school reading,I had to read this book for summer reading before the beginning of the school year. It is not an uplifting book but pretty suspenseful. It does make you think about alot of different issues in life(and I have thought alot about how to protect myself).
5,Worth every minute,"Sometimes I worry that I might be wasting my time reading a thriller after seeing the film version. After all, if I know what's going to happen, how can there be much suspense, right? On reading The Silence of the Lambs I discovered my fears were completely unjustified.Thomas Harris is an excellent writer. I just sat for ten minutes trying to think of how to review his writing without sounding over-the-top gushy with praise...sorry, can't do it. Within the pages of the novel, his characters ARE alive, even those that appear in only one scene. The plot is intricate, compelling and it blasts forward like a rocket. Harris' descriptive ability is outstanding. He leads the reader right up to the point where the reader's own imagination takes over and almost makes the world of the novel an immediate concrete reality.This book will take you to some dark and scary places, but don't worry - Clarice Starling is there with you and she's got a gun and fast reflexes."
5,Amazing book!,"This was a great book! Reading the thoughts of Hannibal Lecter was both interesting and disturbing, and Jame Gumb was a messed up guy. But they both made the book more interesting to read."
3,Slightly better than the movie,It's certainly a better book than Black Sunday or Red Dragon but it's still so ridiculously improbable. I know Lecter is supposed to be the glue that holds the book together but honestly he bugs me. He's an unneccessary distraction from an otherwise interesting thriller/mystery.
3,"A good book, but a disappointing ending","I have not yet read Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon, but I do plan to in the near future, hoping they end better than this one! It started out as a terrific book, with thrills, suspense, and twists. I wish I could tell you what happens at the end just so you won't read the book. It just doesn't make sense and is not realistic. Everyone is hoping for the book to end one way, but......"
2,Falls short of the movie,"Perhaps I've watched the movie too many times. I found the book itself dull. Nothing compares to that look in A. Hopkins' eyes ... watch for it in ""Hanibal"" at the end of the slide-show scene!"
5,One of my favourite books!,"I've read this book more times than any other book. Ever. Love his prose, love the story.Just wished he'd write like this again!"
4,Excellent Thriller!,"This book doesn't leave the reader sitting for long; they're dragged along with Agent Starling as she uncovers the murderer, trying to out-think him before he murders again. Thomas Harris did a marvelous job describing each setting and object in the story without sounding frilly like some other authors tend to. If one is considering watching the movie, definitely do so BEFORE reading the book. This way, one can appreciate the movie for all its worth and not feel the let down when the movie isn't 100% parallel with the book."
4,"Recommended, but I enjoyed Red Dragon more","I was very happy to have been introduced to Thomas Harris by way of Red Dragon. Harris' novels have a great tempo, and I like his ""cut out the fat"" writing style that keeps your attention on the story. Silence of the Lambs exemplifies Harris' great writing style. I can see why Hannibal Lecter has become one of the most well-known book villains of our time; the way Harris develops Hannibal's character, you really feel as though you're listening to a crazed psychopath. That being said, I actually enjoyed Red Dragon a bit more than Silence of the Lambs. For one, I liked Graham as a protagonist better than Clarice Starling. I also thought the ""Tooth Fairy"" was a bit more interesting than Buffalo Bill. These are both great and recommended reads though."
4,A real page turner,"Well first off, it is obvious that anyone that has seen the movie (and who hasn't?) will not be as captivated by the gripping suspenseful plot, as a first time read is. That being said, the book is a must read. . FBI trainee, Clarice Starling matches wits with notorious serial killer Hanibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter, picking his brains (get it) to try to catch another serial killer, Buffalo Bill. Very engaging plot and excellent characters keep Silence of the Lambs moving along at break-neck speed. A great book for anyone that enjoys a nail biting suspense with a little blood and guts mixed in."
5,Solid classic,"I read this after seeing the movie. The movie itself is really good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Hannibal Lecter, but the book itself has plenty that isn't in the movie (typical of any book to movie adaptation)There's lots of scenes in the book not in the movie, so you get an awesome story here. There's not much I can say that other reviewers haven't already said. This is a nice, thick book with a long story, so you're guaranteed at least a few hours of good reading here."
2,False Advertising,The product description is not accurate. It indicates that the set contains two pairs of the scissors and a Fuzz remover. The package arrived with only one pair of scissors and no fuzz remover. Beware of the false advertising.
2,good product,"I would give this product 5 stars except for the fact that once you've used the extra blades that come with the scissors, its impossible to find any more. The store where I bought them no longer sells them. So now I'm stuck with dull blades that won't cut anything."
5,A very good introductory book.,I found this book to have been well worth the time it took to read. It covers everything and is a good summary of the events that had to do with World War II. Definately recommended.
1,This is a history book?,"This book is fun to read, entertaining and light hearted. Unfortunately the authors, to entertain, look for off beat sources that are funny but simply false. For example, the portion on the 1940-41 campaign in the Balkans is based exclusively on the works of an aide de camp to the thoroughly incompetent British General who lost the campaign. This unworthy chooses to blame Britain's ally -- Greece -- for a disaster that he largely caused. This episode is typical of the book. Do not waste money on it."
5,An Informative Book!,"Excellent overview of one of the most written-about subjects in our lifetime. Bard gives us many familiar facts, but also includes information not found in many books, such as about Berga, the POW camp for Jewish soldiers.Easy to read, well-organized, and with an extensive bibliography. A book not just for beginners in history, but a informative book for everyone. Highly recommended!"
4,Informative and an Easy Read...,"Definitely not the typical book of war history here. Instead of focusing on only one point of the war (i.e. the diplomacy or strategy) this book gives a very informative overview of the events leading up to the war as well as the important happenings during the great conflict. The book also provides interesting side-bar facts that help tie today's world to the world of that time. An excellent account, and a great addition to anyone's history library."
4,good overview,"I enjoyed this book as a overview of WWII. I would have liked to see more grahphics, maps, timelines, etc. Sometimes a page is spent trying to explain something that could have been much easier to visulize with a map or diagram."
2,Should be better!,"Yes, the steel base is fairly well made and solid, but I can't give the entire product more than 2 stars.The three issues I have with this unit are:* The wheels are really cheap. I expect I'll be changing them out before long.* The brakes for the wheels are very poor engineering. Yes they work, but come on is this the best the POWERMATIC engineering staff can come up with? In this instance I am using the term engineering loosely!* The price charged for this item is out of line with the quality of the materials and quality of the manufacturing. This item is more along the lines of a HF unit selling for $29.99.To my fellow rater, ""No it isn't you. One expects a level of quality above the rest when they purchase a POWERMATIC product, unfortunately for the consumer POWERMATIC did not deliver that with this product!""Yes, it could be better, but it's not and because it's POWERMATIC it should be better!"
2,Dissapointed,I bought this because of a song I heard from it on Bluesville (XM radio)but after I recieved it realized that was actually the only good song on it.I could not even sell it on ebay I had to give it away.No more Preston for me.
3,disappointed,I sent this to my sick mother whom I don't live close enough to take care of and I was disappointed. There were several items that were substituted and not substituted equally for what you are expecting. The description makes it sound much nicer than it actually is.
1,Sadly disappointed,"I ordered the Get Well Soon Chicken Soup Tote - Gourmet Food Gift basket to be delivered to my sister following her surgery. I asked for her comments on the gift; she said that many of the items were stale. It was cute, but I will not order this item again.I wrote to the supplier about this and never received a reply of any kind.I tried to find something different, but this one is not worth it."
5,Perfect for sick friends.,I have sent this to a few of my friends/family members when they are sick and they always love it. The items are high quality and tasty!
1,"Looks and feels good, but defective","Just as another reviewer said, it wouldn't hang up. I plugged the cord into the phone jack and heard a continuous dial tone, regardless of the position of the cradle. Makes me worry about quality control at the factory where the phone is produced. I returned the phone and was given a prompt refund by Amazon."
4,Fun phone,"My sons love this phone. It seems to be sturdy and is definitely fun for short conversations. The main drawback is that there is a lot of background noise to the other caller. It's almost as if the speaker phone is always on. I'm keeping this phone, but won't be using it for long conversations."
5,Very Nice Phone,"This phone is as authentic as a replica can be; even down to the mechanical ringing bells. Very solidly constructed & works well. Totally love it!Because if its weight & requires two hands to use, not too practical for lengthy phone calls though."
2,"Nice looking phone, but did not work","I was really looking forward to having this phone. It looked great and really quite heavy, not made with cheap material. Except, it would not hang up even with the earpiece in the earpiece holder. The dial tone would not go away. I have sent it back and Amazon gave me a prompt refund. I have ordered a replacement and hope this will be a better experience. If the next one is bad, I guess the idea of having an ""Andy Griffith Show phone"" will never be."
5,roaring 20s phone,very much like phone.better quality than 1 i had before.chicago roars again in the 20s.
4,Great phone!,"Well the first one I ordered arrived dead as a door nail, but the return went smoothly and the replacement phone they sent is working perfectly. LOVE THE LOOK OF IT. I highly recommend it!"
5,Excellent very solid phone--we love it!,"Unlike the reviewer whose phone was made of ""light plastic,"" ours certainly is not. In fact, it weighs a hefty 55 ounces, 3 and a half pounds. It rivals the phone of my childhood in being as heavy and as solidly constructed as the original was. It also has a volume control under the base which the original did not. In short, it's not only a trip down memory lane, but a solid instrument as well--rare in these days of cheap phones. It goes beautifully with my rolltop desk and lifts my spirits as well. Modern convenience with a traditional flavor leads us to say, we love it! We think you will, too!"
5,Hold The Phone!,"This phone looks fantastic, the price is totally right and I, too, have no idea what one reviewer is referring to when he complains it's made of lightweight plastic. On the contrary, I was really pleased how heavy and absolutely solid and well-made this phone feels from top to bottom. I received far, far more than I expected and how often does that happen?"
4,"Great Quality, heavier than expected","I ordered this phone for my apartment because I like the look of the candlestick phone and thought it would make a great accent piece for my apartment. Considering most people don't use landline phones anymore I figured I would just use this phone sparingly. When it arrived, I was suprised how heavy and sturdy the phone was constructed. The hearing quality is better than my cellphone and I find excuses to use the phone now. I recommed this phone, fun to use and have in your home. Only complaint, I wish it was rotary."
4,Good Looking pPhone,I initially order the phone as a eye catcher piece in my guess room but the phone actually worked really well as well. Sound quality is great
5,Loved it!,I enjoyed this book a great deal! Lance & Summer made a great couple! Can't wait to read more from this author!
4,GAAL Review-Sistagaal,"Summer Jones is strong-willed, independent and outspoken. When she meets Lance, she realizes that she has met her match. The chemistry between them is undeniable as Summer soon begins working for Lance at his record label. I truly enjoyed this book as the relationship between Lance and Summer unfolded while they both worked hard denying their feelings for each other."
1,Crys Too Much,"I have to say this is the first book I've ever read that I skipped entire sections, out of sheer bordum, and it never seemed to mattter. The main characters of this book, Summer and Lance, are just totally unbelievable and not developed at all. Even during parts that should have been really hard on her I never felt any established connection. And talk about a cry baby! The smallest thing would send Summer into sobs. Like one minute she was an independent strong women, then be crying like an idiot over nothing. She was totally irrational to say the least. I don't recommend this book to anyone, you get what you pay for but I would like my 99 cents back."
3,Hard to get thru,"I found it predictable n a bit boring. Too good to be true n some parts even sound unrealistic. I had trouble finishing the book. I feel like this writer has a lot of room for improvement, especially developing the characters."
3,Not what I was epecting,I selected Hot Summer because the blurb made it sound wonderful. I found that this story was everywhere and nowhere at the same time.Summer as the main character is a very spoiled selfish whinny brat and I felt that she needed to see a counselor for her manic behavior. Her nastiness towards others wasn't cute and it was not pleasant to have Lance think her attitude was a breath of fresh air.There also wasn't a seamless flow of the plot and I found myself jumping from point A to point Z trying to figure out what I missed.Basically I didn't think this was that good of a story.
1,Hot Summer,"Bored could not finish if after the first 20 pages I put it down. It was to unrealistic, just not a good read at all."
1,Boring,"After reading the synopsis this book I thought it would be a great fun romance. Well, the book was so predictable that I ended up skipping parts. I didn't feel the characters were well developed. Don't waste your time on this book."
5,Thoroughly Enjoyed Reading This!!!,"The story line flowed effortlessly. While reading about Summer & Lance it was great to see how their relationship progressed from employee/employer to something deeper. With everything she was dealing with (as it pertained to school, life & her mom's health situation) Summer was always focused, intellegent & strong, yet in a lot of ways I found her naivete about other areas of life & in relation to Lance refreshing. I loved that Judy Powell portrayed Lance's character to be a man of integrity who from the beginning realized that Summer was to be (for lack of a better phrase) handled with care due to her inexperience (which he sensed/knew based on his prior experience with women / from being in the field that he was in where women are literally a dime a dozen).I love it when a book makes me smile after reading it & Hot Summer by Judy Powell definitely did that :-)"
4,Spicy and Sweet!,"I enjoyed reading this book, it is a sweetly spicy romance- nothing graphic. There was a stubbornly independent girl who has a ""cute meet"" with a rich handsome successful man. The Love story has some bumps along the way, insecurities etc. They try to avoid each other, but boy do they sizzle when they get together. The secondary characters are well fleshed out and I even found them interesting and wanted to know the rest of their story. Try the book it's a nice way to pass an afternoon."
5,loved it,"This contemporary,romantic book is one that you simply cannot put down until after you have read it completely.The characters Lance & Summer are intriguingly interesting,with steamy sex passions and strong will.The sexual tension is high,and the conflicts between them kept me reading,wanting to know what would come next between them.For me, what followed was just what I expected,they got married."
4,Good Read,There were some typos and some parts of the story were hard to believe but it kept my interest enough to read it in a couple days.
3,S-video cables fit loosely but does the job well for the price,"I bought 3 of these and they work well enough when the S-video cables stay connected. They fit loosely and fall out easily. I tested the cables in various jacks and the S-video fit was consistently loose. Otherwise, the cables are sufficiently flexible and the audio cables fit securely. For the price, they are good. Just leave all components in one spot and stay away from the cables. If the S-video fit is a real issue, the price is low enough to justify buying a separate S-video cable to replace it."
5,classic,"Love this movie, every time I watch it I see something I didn't see before. Gives you an insight into the sacrifice and dedication it takes for a woman to make the choice to be a Nun."
5,transformation,"The end of this movie contains the most important visual representation of an individual's transformation in all film history. Well, maybe not, it is second only to the ending of Kubrick's 2001."
3,A bit disappointed,"My disappointment of course is not with the movie itself, as it is a wonderful movie. I did think however, that it was going to be remastered and in better shape than it was. It looked as if nothing had be done to it whatsoever. When you buy vintage movies, read everything about it. . . has the sound been remixed, has the movie been remastered? It is something to take into consideration for all you purist out there. Beware. . ."
5,The Nun's Story,"I bought this dvd to replace a VHS tape because I was unable to transfer it from VHS to Dvd. It was a fast transaction. I ordered on Friday night, it arrived on Monday"
4,A Classic,This is a classic film you could watch over and over again. You see Audrey Hepburn in a different light.
4,Nun's Story - Questions Answered,"This movie is the true life story of a young lady who went into a convent before WWII in Europe. I am not a Catholic, and have had many questions about Nuns, their motivation for becoming, and staying, a ""Bride of Christ."" This film not only answered my questions, but it was also entertaining, and a wonderful human interest story. I only wish that her life had taken a different path when she was faced with the Nazis, but you'll have to watch it to see what I mean. Good purchase, to watch time and time again, because it takes several viewings to get the jest of the entire film."
5,Classic Film Uncomparable to any other!,"I read ""The Nun's Story"" when I was 12 years old, and was impacted by the personal trials of ""Sister Luke."" Audrey Hepburn is perfect in the role, and portrays the character with insight and soulful clarity. The journey from postulate, to novice and then, final vows depicts the nun's story. The struggle for perfection, striving to balance humanity and it's sin with a spiritual connection with God has never been more beautifully presented. This movie is entertaining, moving and engages the viewer like no other. Recommend in this DVD format. The perfect movie!"
5,A peek into monastic living,This movie gave a good peak into monastic life. They did a good job ineducating the viewer without the viewer realizing it. This is a good movie.
4,"If you love Audrey, you'll love this movie","I found this movie very entertaining in terms of watching Audrey Hepburn with her wide array of talent. It was also, what I felt, to be an accurate depiction of the life of a nun which was interesting to watch as well. If you are an Audrey fan, you'll like this performance."
5,Moving and Inspirational Movie,"Audrey Hepburn is best known for playing the leading lady in romantic-comedies, but this movie is one of the few that she made that is full drama.Normally, I would tell you the summary and plot of the movie, but I'm sure there are tons of reviewers who give a very detailed look into the movie. So instead of that, I'm here to say that if you're ready for a different side of Audrey as an actress, PLEASE buy, rent, borrow, do ANYTHING to see this movie, because this really shows Audrey's incredible, God-give talent. And if you enjoyed this film, I'm sure you'd love to see another one of her dramas, Wait Until Dark."
1,great pr for nuns...ack,"what a disaster for portraying ANYONE who volunteers for such an admirable vocation to help those in need in Africa... like there are sooooo many women who desire to do this, wth? treat them like crap n maybe they will fall in line with whatever is the rule de jour??? I dedicated myself to become a nun when I was 12yo and took this vow soooo seriously but never in my life did I find this aspect of horror as part of this commitment, I am sooooo disapointed in this portrayal of religious life that I had to comment n describe my sorrow of such a poor depiction of an honorable profession... is ANY if this story true??? if so I denounce this order and proclaim that Jesus is LOVE and hope they get the message....yikes!"
4,Woh G.I. Joe,"Here it is so open your eyes and pay attention: This movie is Money. Slow money like the kind you get for selling lemonade on the corner for 5 cents. Slow like Flo Jo runs in a marathon. I sugjest you drink a lot when you watch this movie. I did one time and it really braught it all together. like two storms that come together somewhere in middle america and causes a tornado all up in yah. Yeah this movie is hard to get into for sure. like getting into watching cricket on tv. I like the part when she's in the jungle, it really gives you a feel of what it must be like. Just like I did with your girlfriend last night. I think it's worth seeing at least once. Like it's worth seeing cry of the white wolf once. If your a hepburn fan like me than this movie should interest you. If not, than I wouldn't bother."
2,The Disobedient Nun's Story,"It is quite an entertaining for a secular viewers but rather a very disturbing thing to the soul of those who understand what it means for taking vow of obedience in the religious order. To me, the movie is about an ambitious nurse who takes advantage of the religious life for her own fame. There is no spiritual inpriration or any benefit for any good catholic viewer who may know what a real value of a consecrated person should be."
1,I would give it less than a zero rating!!!!,"What a horror of an example to others. This is a story about a nun and her temptations about her calling. Well, in the end she fails and gives up her vocation. What a let down of a movie. As if it is the most impossable thing to persevere in one's vocation as a nun. Nice one hollywood, another blow to the religious. I felt it my duty to warn those who wish to obtain this dvd, thats why I gave away the story. audrey hepburn does a disservice to our religious by playing the role of an apostate nun, shame on her! An Audrey fan no more. This is not in the same class as 'The song of Bernadette', 'A Man for all seasons', 'Therese', 'El Cid', etc."
5,One of My Top Five Favorite Movies,"I don't know why, but this movie has always moved me. I have loved it since I was a kid, and when it came out on VHS, it was mine. I have watched it so many times that my tape is failing. I am extremely happy that it is FINALLY coming out on DVD. Gabrielle has a vocation, she gives up a family that loves her to enter the convent. She wants to be sent to the Congo to nurse the natives. But her faith, or more accurately, her obedience is tested over and over again. The end is not certain, it leaves you to ponder and determine how you would end the movie."
4,Audrey Hepburn at her best,"I hadn't seen this movie in a long time, and couldn't pass it up at the great price Amazon offered it. Audrey Hepburn did an excellent job in it. I remember the film was controversial with my Catholic friends, but I think the film is realistic."
5,THEY'VE ALL GONE DIGGING INTO CHICKEN,"""I want you to enjoy yourselves.... within the limits of British decency."" Hadn't heard this album in years and it still brought a tear to my eye. So sweet and life affirming. Full of scottish zen like observations about the simple and exquisite things in life we normally overlook. His best album. GB"
1,Not what they seem to say!,"Alright, everyone has been praising this book and it is obviously because they have a LOT of dedication. I bought this book from amazon and was extremely excited. I opened it up and my jaw DROPPED! It is comprehensive, but that's not why I was shocked. IT IS DOWN RIGHT BORING. If you're like me, you need something to keep you awake. I love test prep that works and that's is why I am warning you to stay away.Yeah, it has information, but not even as comprehensive as Peterson's or Princeton Review's. The sections were very minor and didn't have much detail on certain events. There were no practice questions after sections! I guess I would buy it for the practice tests but even those weren't great. Check out Arco, Kaplan, of Princeton Review. Any Barron's or REA book is horrible (even the format was boring:just plain paragraphs, no margins, sidenotes, concentrated material, jokes, pictures)."
3,not worth your money,"This review book was ok, just okay. Not stellar, and not bad, but not the best one out there.Pros:- it has good MC questions- it has just the right amount of information (not as much as a textbook, not as little as the 5 steps series)- broken down and organized pretty well- very long and boringCons:- the DBQ's and the Essay questions arent much of a help. Their grading scale is off on the Free Response portion- some very very minor typos- No review questions at the end of each section unlike most other review books- Does not emphamize much about how the test is graded- Key Cases and Names are hard to find ( I ended up highliting them the first time I read them for easy reference)- *My* CD did not work. It was simply blank, with two picture files in them, and the software is on an ""as is"" basis, so no replacement or refundOverall, don't waste your money unless you're getting this in conjunction with other books. It can't stand alone very well."
5,Superb!,"This book is really one of the best review materials for the AP test. However, it goes very in-depth which is bad for cramming. The actual AP test doesn't ask for dates; it asks for social and political trends. Sometimes it asks for dates and specific things, which is where the REA book really shines. The REA book goes by time periods then breaks everything down with clearly labeled, easy to read section and subsections. If used to study early and not for cramming, I think it is an invaluable, handy book to have."
5,A great preparation base,"I have not yet taken the AP US History national examination, but this book has been a great help, with decent, concise, and accurate chronoligial information. I haven't even used the software-the book is so great!"
3,Solid Review,"I'm a sophomore in US History, and I got this book to fill in any gaps i had not had previously filled.I heard this book had a good review but inaccurate tests.Let me just say, the review is not as cracked up as people say it is.A. Slightly over informativeB. Review is not molded together, just a progression of terms, which I think does not help you relate them together.C. Poorly WrittenI ended up using my textbook for the review it is called ""People and a Nation"" by norton--its AMAZING..Get that if you want a good review but it is a textbook about 570 pages--"
5,A Rockin' Blues Christmas,This is a fantasic holiday album by Roomful Of Blues-you'll never tire of hearing it even long after the Christmas season. Whether they are playing their own versions of classics like The Christmas Song; White Christmas; etc. or their own tunes such as Christmas Celebration & I Want To Spend Christmas With You; this cd rocks!
3,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : my two cents too, its' missing","""Is just the right addition to thier catalogue of timeless releases"" BULL BULL BULL They missed the eye on many a track.I'm left wanting something with more spirited conjuring ,as sucessfully applied to White Christmas and Good Morning Blues . Many of their versions sound tired and too tidy for my taste, as if they recorded this in June. With all that said I still play the disc every holiday and merrily mix tracks 1,2,4,6,and 10 and wish these gifted artists give it another go . ***buyit,savesome,sharesome,sellitused***"
3,PHAT TRACK,LOVE THAT SONG U CAN DANCE OR BOB YOUR HEAD TO IT. BOYFRIEND TOLD ME THAT IT WASN'T MY JAM BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHO MADE THE SONG. BUT I KNOW NOW.
5,STRICTLY SOUTHERN RIDE-OUT MUSIC FROM JT!!!,"JT MONEY HAS EVERYONE AROUND AMERICA BUMPIN' TO HIS LATEST HIT.IF Y'ALL DON'T REMEMBER HE WAS WITH POISON CLAN, BEFORE HE WENT SOLO.HE'S JUST ESTABLISHING THE SOUTH,MAKING IT THAT MUCH HARDER THAN IT ALREADY IS.JT WAY TO REPRESENT MIAMI."
4,Works Great,"I tied 2 pugs (20lbs each) to this when we went to the park so we could relax on a blanket without them jumping on us. It worked great. The ground was a little hard, so it hurt my hand a bit to screw this thing in, but once in it held the little yappers."
4,Pretty good,"I have a medium size dog(about 30 lbs.) that is VERY strong and energetic for her size. This stake took some elbow grease to get it into the ground, but it has worked pretty well, considering the force the dog uses to pull on it. It has a swivel on the o-ring that keeps it from tangling the cord. I bought two of these; one of them broke off at the top handle where you hold it to screw into the ground. The other was fine. Since they are relatively inexpensive, i am still pleased with this product, and plan to buy a replacement for the one that broke."
4,THE ABC'S OF CHAKRA THERAPY,I AM STILL READING THIS BOOK.BUT SO FAR I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BEGINNERS WITH CHAKRA THERAPY.THE BOOK REALLY WALKS YOU THROUGH ALL THE CHAKRA AND HELPS YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW CHAKRA'S EFFECT YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE AND THNGS TO DO TO CLEAR YOUR CHAKRAS
4,5.99 for flannel sheets can't beat that!!!,"I give these 4 stars, I ordered 3 packages for 5.99 each for my kids beds, and out of the 3 I ordered one set was not soft at all, like they forgot the flannel. BUT because they were cheap we are keeping them and using them anyhow. 5.99 for a complete set of flannel sheets is a GREAT PRICE!!! and we live where it is cold!!!"
5,Kids love them,"I bought a set for my son and daughter, and they both love them. They're warm and cozy, and really cute too. I'd recommend anyone buy them!"
5,GREAT DEAL!,"was like $6 for the set, SO SO soft, cute colorful design with hats and socks and mittens"
3,Not bad .... I would buy them again.,"I bought these because of the very low price, and my 5 year old has been chilly at night with his regular cotton sheets, even with his 2 quilts on his bed. I bought the ""Hats and Mittens"" set, as well as the ""Snow Follies"" set. When I opened the packages, I noticed immediately that the two sheet sets felt VERY different. The ""Snow Follies"" set was MUCH softer and thicker. After washing, I noticed the exact same thing again --- the ""Hats and Mittens"" set was not as soft, and felt thinner and corser. Upon washing, I also noticed that the sheet elastic casing had come un-sewn along one corner pocket in the fitted sheet, but that was quite easy to fix - just annoying and unimpressive. For the price I got them for, I am glad I bought them, but they were not quite the consistant quality I was hoping for. My 5 year old loves them though ... it's a good thing he's not very picky!"
3,Charming and educational,"This is an educational book that consists of 50 two page spreads, each of which is dedicated to one of the 50 states.The information includes a picture of the state, with a couple of major cities and geographical features noted. There is also a fun fact about the state presented in a bullet point, and a separate informational article that talks about the state history, famous points, major exports, etc.It's a nicely done format, but it is in the process of becoming an artifact, as the internet has far more impressive, fun, and interactive ways to learn about the states."
2,Not All That Helpful,A total lack of explanation for the syntax. I get the recipe nature but no break down on the syntax. I found no learning value and never found a case where the code sample was exactly what I needed.
2,Didn't use this one much,This book went over too many different flavors of regular expressions for my taste. I also think it is more oriented to someone who doesn't know or care about how regular expressions work and just wants a quick answer. So if you already know regex fairly well this book won't introduce anything new to you. You can find most of these in the online regex libraries.
4,"Helen's War - and it is a war, against ignorance","A good video about this fiesty woman who has done so much to make people aware of nuclear radiation and its hazards. Co-creator of the Physicians for Social responsibility and creator of Women's Action for New Direction, Dr. Caldicott remains active within the ant-nuclear movement, even in her 70s. I've met Helen on several occasions, one being at the Savannah River Site, and last heard her speak in 2011 at a WAND event in Georgia.A movie everyone on both sides of the nuclear issue should see."
3,ICON not get into some of this,"I like the tracks ""Mirror"" and ""Vehicle"" very much in fact and listen to them at work on my PC. On these two tracks Lane and Hellborg are prominent and the reason I bought the CD. Haven't tried it yet, but was wondering whether it's worth trying to meditate to ""Vehicle"", if I can remember to take it home; I do not like the other two tracks ""Anchor"" and ""Escape"" however. The percussionists' verbal play mimicking their instruments is tiring to me, it's the reason I gave ""Good People in Times of Evil"" only two stars. I read an interview with Lane once about singing his leads like the like these Indian percussionists sing their parts, and so to me anyway, it seems like an endless over-indulgent exercise in ""practicing"", if it had been kept to a minimum, it would have been OK."
2,Stunning Musicianship! But the Music is...........,"Let me put it this way, I think this music isn't music. In fact, I think most of this album is noise and racket. I really hated this album. I don't like Indian music at all. The only reason I bought this album was because this was guitar virtuoso Shawn Lane's last album. I didn't particularly care for his musical direction in the end, but I will say this: he was truly one of the most amazing guitar players I have ever heard and will probably ever hear. The reason I gave this album two stars was because Lane simply played an incredible guitar solo on the second song ""Mirror."" His tone and delievery were astounding on this song. Anyway, like I said I got this album because it was Lane's last album and I am a collector of Lane's music no matter how bad it is. Lane's passing and the fact that his music is unbelievably hard to find are the reasons why I bought this album."
2,One Minute Fun,"This song is the kind of song you can listen to for week, but this isn't big hit. This is like Aqua's ""Barbie Girl"". Everybody's first talking about it and everybody keeps playing it at parties but after all you'll realize that the song isn't very good. This isn't even fun! Lyrics are for children ONLY! Don't bother..."
1,"Doesn't even deserve 1 STAR, but I had no choice.","Toy Box's ""Tarzan and Jane"" is probably the worst song that I have ever heard. Basically, it is some new euro dance-pop band trying to cash in on Aqua's one-hit-wonderdom here in the states (even though Aqua should have had many, many hits here). Listen to the song! It sounds exactly like Barbie Girl, though its missing every ounce of ingenuity and style. Toy Box should really be ashamed to do something so low. DO NOT BUY or EVEN LISTEN TO THIS SONG!"
5,One of the BEST BOOKS for any TAR HEELS FAN!,"I recieved this book for Christmas and read it right away! This book has many sections that discuss famous players including Michael Jordan, Eric Montross, and Sean May! The book also discusses famous coaches, of course including the almighty Dean Smith! It talks about all the ACC and NCAA tounramnets and championships we have won! It also discusses the rivalries, of course including UNC vs. DUKE and NC State!One thing that I really liked about the book was that it told how UNC got its colors, mascot, and name, TAR HEELS!This is an awesome book for any Carolina fan and I really do think that true UNC fans should get this book to learn the history of their college they love so much! I hope my review was helpful to you!"
3,Beautiful but no rainbows,"when I ordered this I thought I was buying a sun catcher (or rainbow maker). this one, because it doesn't have many edges I assume, doesn't produce any rainbows, just clear/white light rays. it's looks very stunning hanging in the window but it unfortunately is only that. I just wish it made rainbows!"
4,nice crystal,The item arrived quickly and well packaged. It is hanging in my window now and casting nice little rainbow prisms across the room. It does not put out as much color or light as other designs (I knew this going in)but it makes a nice compliment to the other crystal I have it hanging with. They make a stunning pair.
3,Good live but ok cd,"I picked up this cd a while ago at a show with Falling Cycle, Sinai Beach, and some other bands. I had never heard Sinai Beach before but I thought that they put on an incredible performance and they are great about witnessing to non-Christians about Jesus Christ. Anyway I decided to get this cd which had recently just been released back then. Unfortunately their cd isn't nearly as good as they are live. I really did want to like this cd but the fact is that its not very good. I dont think all of the songs are that great and the quality seems a bit iffy on it too. My favorite songs though are Never Say Never and Candice. Another plus about this group is that their songs have great lyrics so be sure to listen to them and read them while listening to it."
2,"MEH,.....",This guys are dull. They mix simple breakdowns with heavy metak melodies.And they have boring screaming and boring vocals.The whole thing is sometimes brutal but repetitive and not originalD-
1,not for everybody,Had to buy another strap. Would not recommend to anyone who plays above their belt. There is not much room for adjustment.I am 6 ft 190 and like to play chest high. I tied a knot in the strap to get it high enough. Better off getting a 10$ cheepo and a tuner.
5,"Good strap, well made, comfortable!","I have bought and used about every banjo strap known to man, the Neotech is by far superior to anything else I have hooked up to my Gibson ESS. The straps are easy to hook and unhook, I have two sets on my banjo, one set for the Neo and another for the harness I use when the back needs a rest. It's easy to uphook one and hook the other. Well done and I like the bounce feature, softens out the jolts."
5,Best strap I've ever used on my banjo.,"I noticed the way the banjo positioned and seemed to feel lighter right away.It was easy to install and what is really nice separates easily for storage in the banjo case.I will probably order another set of quick connect loops for my other instruments. I added a fuzzy velcro sheath around the contact points where the nylon loops met wood,just to avoid abrasion.The pad is a little wide so I wear a shirt with a stand up collar if I'm going to play for any length of time.I am well pleased with the way it feels,though,weight wise and will recommend it to others."
5,Awesome Strap,I bought it because I really like that it has clips so I can easily take it off when I put in the case. Got it a few days ago and it's by far the most comfortable strap I have ever owned. It really reduces the feel of the weight. Suits my needs perfectly.
3,Almost But Not Quite,"I use this strap on my banjo. I like everything about this strap except the pad could be longer.No matter which direction I wear it, part of the nylon strap rests on my shoulder or neck and gets uncomfortable after a while."
5,Just bought my 2nd one,"Fantastic strap. Nope, it isn't leather or tooled or all that kind of stuff... But it is really comfortable and fitted with ease even my CC-OT banjo that has a *really* tight spacing (all the others I tried were a bit of work to fit through the brackets). Had it on my heavy weight resonator bluegrass, once again extremely comfortable and sturdy, so had to buy another so I can just have one on each."
3,Banjo Strap,"Decent strap, the plastic clips rub against the banjo sometimes, but its better than metal buttons or rivets on some other straps. I put some hockey tape over the clips and to rectify the issue, and it works great now. It would be nice if the neoprene pad portion was a little longer."
3,Misleaded by Amazon,"I thought I was buying a large book like the Art of Disney books, but it turns out this books has 98 pages instead of 192, which says so in the product details. So I was disappointed.Other than that I think it's a fine book. If you're a fan of the film this is a book you should take a look at."
5,Finding Anastasia!,"This is a precious book that show all the making of behind the movie of Don Bluth, ex talent of the Walt Disney productions!It's full of sketches, drawings, paintings etc.. a little-great book!*"
4,Art of Anastasia,I've been interested in the Romanovs for a long time and even though the animated Anastasia movie was full of inaccuracies this book capturres the romanticism of Imperial Russia.
1,Disney?,Just wondering why a Twentieth Century Fox book comes up under a search for the Walt Disney Company?
4,classic 80's cd,"i enjoyed this dvd. it brough me back to my hay day of the 80's. glass tiger , eddie money, the cars, the pretenders, the talking heads and all the the high energy bands that i danced too at concerts and parties"
4,Bold and intriguing author lurks in uncertain moral realms,"I plucked this book off of a library shelf on a whim, and now I'm a fan of Jim Crace. I've heard it said that if there is a common theme in Crace's writing, it's that he sets his stage during times of social change. Here, Crace brings us to a town about to lose its economic basis to technological innovation. The author takes us into its Christian racism and its moral quandaries, even as the town lives in denial of its own doom. Denial seems to operate the mind of the protagonist as well, and his own high-minded timidity hangs over the age as its defining quality. Crace is an gifted writer, whose work offers the reader joy and lends insight into our contemporary geist."
5,I look forward with pleasure to reading more of this author,"I was uncertain choosing this at the library. The Atlantic Monthly review of this book compared the author to ""the best"" literary Brits: Salman Rushdie (no interest), Ian McEwan (""ominous"" writing for others, flat to me) and Martin Amis (dreary). Now I am so glad I did! This book is wonderfully atmospheric, similar to Island by Jane Rodgers but less dark, and I was hooked immediately. As the characters are introduced they are wonderfully rooted in time and place. And Aymer Smith the main character is a real achievement: a contemptibly dishonest windbag yet pathetically human and somehow sympathetic. The puzzle of what this character represented for the author and what he was going to do with him, finally wouldn't let me put the book down. Highest recommendation!"
3,Is there ever such a thing as a good deed ?,"Aymer Smith is quite a creation. Painful at times to read, Crace highlights the self-deception of a man convinced his actions are all altruistic.It's not as good as 'Quarantine', but you won't regret the read."
3,Sorely Lacking !!,"What I thought would be an historic document of the Pope's message to America on his 1979 trip... turned out to be four CD's of ""snippets"" some as short as 23 seconds.. Where are the major speeches and homilies in their entirety. How dare you rip us off in providing the historic documentation of this Saint... $30.00 for sound bites... We want it all"
1,Stay Away,"This stuff smells like a public restroom. It is horrible, do not get it. I thought maybe I was wrong after I first used it but after using it a couple of times now I just can't get over how it smells."
1,Bunch of useless tips for fearful speakers,"I purchased this book expecting a book that would ease my anxiety of public speaking, and Ms Wilder certainly ""claims"" in her introduction that this book is to help you become less fearful, but the tips actually are for speakers who are ALREADY fearless but just need to improve their speech skills: For example: Get immediate response from audience. You know, the last thing I want to do in a presentation is further prolong it by asking what they think of it. My plain goal, Ms Wilder, is just to complete a mediocre if dull presentation WITHOUT anxiety, not get responses from my audience and so forth. I can hardly find any good books on stage fright. They either don't help at all or are off the subject."
4,Eloquent blend of practical advice and inspiration.,"Lilyan's 7 Steps to Fearless speaking was a godsend. As a computer consultant, companies pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for my services, yet when required to present findings or project status to executive boards I often feel mechanical, not delivering the pizzazz they deserve for their dollar. Lilyan not only provided insights to enhancing my style, she also provided strategies for the components of a successful presentation, combined with real life stories to connect with. She has found an eloquent blend of practical approach and accentuating your voice potential, the ""Mirror of your soul""."
2,Not Helpful For Me,"Yes, the 7 steps can teach people in all types of careers and lifestyles to improve their oral communications skills but some of her methods are a bit ""out there"". For example: learning to focus on your voice as an instrument. The CD includes examples and anecdotes from Wilder's own work, and a number of exercises to help the reader implement the ideas set forth. If you're looking to overcome your fear of public speaking, join Toastmasters and skip this CD."
3,ok,"This product was ok quality. It showed up a different color than I ordered, so I pretty pissed about that."
1,PURE HOLLYWOOD....( not even good Hollywood),"I'm amazed anyone would believe this movie....TOTAL HOLLYWOOD... the props were very unreal...Rent it (more than a dollar like I did at BB is a waste) Watch the part where he is uncovering the ""mummified"" body... So so fake... And a cross on the shroud? WHY?????? When he looks into the camera and says ""This is real!"" is PRICELESS. LOLPretending to be actual uncut footage...it's more like the Blair Witch Project but it's really very contrived. Clue after amazing clue is uncovered right before your very eyes! Messages in no less than four...count them...Four bottles with maps and clues are discovered RIGHT ON CAMERA!!! So you KNOW IT CAN''T BE A LIE,!!Bottles an inch or two below the surface planted by a priest in fear for his very life...WHO ACTUALLY SIGNS THE PARCHMENTS!Why not just lead people to this earth shattering find? What a joke.....worth a really good hard laugh though.... Peace"
1,Bloodline hemorrage,"Ordered this product on Jan 21,2011Still haven't received the order.Please contact seller and encourage him to ensure that the book is sent."
5,BLOODLINE - AWESOME ! ! !,"This DVD was awesome. If you don't mind bucking the established view that Jesus had a life, a wife, and children, then you'll love it. Very factual, historically incredible. Oh BTW, this seller sent me the DVD in record time, for a great price. What's not to like?"
1,Gimmick,"Documentary style trying to capitalize on the success of ""The DaVinci Code"". If you want to spend 2 hrs being bamboozled watching this guy walk around and close-ups of his face this DVD is for you."
1,Don't waste your time,"I purchased this on clearance for $25. It's definitely not worth it. Very cheaply made, and I must have bought a lemon. After melting the chocolate, adding even more than required oil, it would not flow at all. Thankfully I tried it out before the party date. Plenty of time to return it to the store."
5,Fresh...different...better,Bicycle's music differs from the constant blurring of alternative coming out of Seattle recently. Bicycle has great vocals and even better guitar work within the tracks. Future work is something I look forward to.
2,Irritating,I bought this album based on the glowing 5 start reviews you all gave it but it just bugged the crap out of me. I hope Amoeba Music will buy it for some decent credit.
3,Another Fine Alphabet Book,"Good for 2-6 yrs. The problem with alphabet books, is that theyare a dime a dozen. It is a fine book for early readers, or young onesbeing read to. END"
1,"149 pg's of rehash, not worth .10 per page.","I expected an informative, humerous, insightful book of some quantity, and quality. I received a soft cover book of 149 text pages that were repetitive, and admittedly plagiarized. I was charged $15.00 for this ""book"" and you now have it for $12, which is still too much."
1,This is the slowest of the three Kingston Cards,"This card is rated UP TO 5MB read, UP TO 1.5 MB write. Kingston SD Elite Pro offers 8.2MB read, 7.7MB write. Kingston SD Ultimate offers 21 MB read, 18MB write. Compare costs and know what you are getting for your dollar."
4,Kingston SD/2GBKR 2 GB SD Memory Card,"I bought this card for my brand new digital camera Fuji S700. The card works perfectly, no any difference with SunDisk brand, except one minor thing - when I plugged it into card reader in my laptop - it didn't show up. I thought it's my laptop problem, but SunDisk card is readable from the same card reader. Everything else is just great. Value to the price is excellent."
4,Good but still some question,I cannot delete the images in the computer when used with a SD adapter. But I can delete them in my DC.
5,Great stuff at great price,"We often prefer brand name product such as Sony, Toshiba, or SanDisk and pay much money with strong belief that we got a great stuff. However, due to competition between business companies in global market, most of brand name products are now assembled in China or Taiwan, so the quality of brand name products, in fact, not as good as we think anymore. If we carefully read some tiny words around the UPC Barcode of Kingston SD Memory Card, we can see that Kingston's products are assembled in Japan, so the quality of Kingston Memory card is as good as quality of brand name products like Sony or Toshiba but we can buy Kingston Memory at an affordable price. To spend my money wisely, I prefer Kingston product; great stuff at great price."
5,Outstanding value,"I'm using this card in a pda phone that I wanted to put pictures, music and other things like a dictionary on. It works great and seems to have enough speed to access the info quickly. For the price you can't beat it!"
5,Great Card and Price,I love this card. There is deffinately enough space for photos and videos as well.
1,ZERO STAR RATING,"We take hundreds of pictures... For someone who has heard the words cancer... You want to capture every moment. (The DR's caught it very very early -- both times)... I want to ensure that my kids will have a life time of memories with their mother, if any thing should happen to me. And this card has now robbed some 400 images (1.5wks worth) from our family... Sadly, those images held the memories of my third child's first month in this world.There are dozens and dozens of review of this card becoming ""dead"" --From what we have read, researched and learned about this card there may be a small chance to salvage some of the images. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE ANY MORE PHOTOS. Call up a photo shop (or two, or two dozen)and find a tech who KNOWS how to salvage images from corupt cards. They may be able to save some of the images (more likely than not), even if only a small percent of the pictures..."
3,"low price, low speed","I guess it is a decent card for the price, but I was disappointed to find that it takes twice as long as my high speed cards do to register a picture. The high speed cards cost twice as much and are twice as fast, so I guess it makes sense that half the price should mean half the speed."
5,no problems,The Kingston SD/2GBKR 2 GB SD Memory Card is a great value. I have used it over and over and never once has it failed me.
2,"product good, shipping bad","I ordered three itemsan SD card from amazona camera from Ritz anda camera case from someone else, it doesn't matter.Amazon sold me a 2 day delivery shipping optionI was under the belief that all parts of the order would be deliveredin 2 days, but Ritz shipped in 7 days, the camera was late for a birthday.Amazon charged me $10 to ship a $10 SD chip and did not mentionthat other vendors could not live up to the 2 day delivery.Buyer beware.When ordering several items that come from different vendorsamazon's shipping options do not work across the board and they apparently do not tell you that other vendors in the package dealcan not live up to the shipping option.And yes the SD chip was what I ordered and it did work fineand it was delivered in 3 days not 2.Amazon needs to work closer with their business partners to agree on multi item, multi vendor shipping arrangements."
2,Does not work fine,"I always use my s700 fuji camera with a 1GB memory, when i use this 2GB memory, stopped to work fine, al pictures blurry, i think.. this is too slow for photos."
4,More Than They Promised: The Studebaker Story,"An Excellent Biography, no details were missed in the writing.Also, product shipping and delivery were very much up to par. I am completely satisfied."
4,studebaker enthusiast must read,awesome cronological of a great car company that should still be producing cars today
5,Get a copy with large type,"This and the sequel ""Birds, Beasts and Relatives"" are among my all-time favorite books. Recently a friend of mine declined to read the latter book in Fontana paperback because the type was too small but it looks like this new edition is a little easier to read. These books would be better still if they were accompanied by photographs of Corfu and of Gerald's animals, so its probably a good idea to read these while also stealing a glance at a photobook of the Greek islands."
5,A pleasant summer read!,"My Family and Other Animals is about a ten-year-old boy named Gerald who moves to the sun-soaked island Corfu, Greece with his family to escape the dreary and gloomy climate in London. There, he encounters many different animals and people. I absolutely loved this book because it was really funny. There was a lot of action in this book. Durrell lovingly described each and every animal that he owned. He also told every detail of the settings, so I felt like I was really in Corfu!If you want to spend your money wisely, use it on this book!"
5,Timeless,I first read this fifteen years ago and to this day it remains one of my favourite books ever. It is truly funny and will surely appeal to readers of all generations. The descriptions of Corfu is blissful and will make anyone want to go there. I highly recommend it. You won't ever get tired of it.
5,"Sublimely wonderful book, especially for Summer reading",This book stands out in my mind as 1 of the very best i've ever read.This story is great for all who want to relive their youth.& for women who want to be AMAZING mothers of sons.Enjoy...
5,Favorite Book,I've lost my old copy of this book and am just about to purchase a new one because I want to read it to my children. I first read this as a 10 or 12-year old. I loved it then and I love it as much now. If I had to name a favorite book - it would definitely be a contender!
3,confusing,"I found this book to be very confusing and I had to re-read the pages about 3 times until I understood it. My teacher MADE me read it so it took a while to finish because I kept re-reading it over and over. Maybe when I get older I will enjoy it more, but for now it is REALLY confusing."
2,My Family & Other Animals Review,The book was in great condition. Better than the vendor described. As for reading the book...didn't like it so much. Oh well good thing I got it for a good deal. : ' )
1,I beg you dont bother reading it,"OK, well i have been MADE to read this book as a part of my english course. I started off and thought maybe its not that bad....but it is. Its awful. Dont even bother with it, its a waste of important time. So there in your face Gerald Durrell. Cheers"
5,I extremely loved it!,"I totally identified myself with Gerard. He has an incredible way to describe all the circumstances of his life. And I'm a zoologist, so I enjoyed it more!"
5,Magical!,"This is my favourite book, bar none. I first studied it in school which should have been a reason for disliking it; instead I have fallen in love with Durrell's autobiographical description of his somewhat dysfunctional family, their gang of eccentric friends, and the fauna and flora he studies and collects ardently and for the seemingly magical island of Corfu. Overall a hillarious and very warmly and beautifully written book. My only regret is in not having a similarly magical childhood."
4,A Good Animal Lover Novel,"The book My Family and other Animals is most definitely a different book. It is about a young boy, the author, who moves to a small island with his large and diverse family. Gerald is very interested in animals and such. So when they move to the island he likes to just wander around and look at the species and try to capture them. There are really two types of writing going on in the novel, a story part and an informational part. It is very interesting during the more story part, for me, since something is actually happening. However, I do no necessarily like the informational part since it is about animals. I do like animals, but I think it is a bore to read about them like it was a text book. Overall, this is a really good book and it keeps you on the edge of your seat, and it makes you laugh when the whole family gets together with all their differences. I recommend it highly to all the animal lovers out there"
5,Hugely funny stories!,"Eight year old goes to a Greek Isle and loves the earwigs, ant lions, dung beetles, scorpions, tortoises and the colorful characters in the neighborhood.Hugely funny stories!""They don't really have the death penalty for anything except bandits. You get three years for murder and five years if you're caught dynamiting fish."""
5,This wonderful and utterly hilarious book changed my life.,"My Family & Other Animals was the very first book that made me laugh out aloud. My lifelong passion for humorous literature, adventure travel, wildlife and wild places was directly inspired by this marvelous work, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to every literate person on this planet. Indeed, I would have to say that Durrell has been the greatest influence on my own, far more modest literary career ... But don't let that put you off.For what it is worth, my absolute favourite Durrell book is The Bafut Beagles, however your lifelong love affair with Gerald Durrell should definitely begin with My Family & Other Animals - it is a genuine treasure. BTG"
4,Good reading,This book isnt for everyone but for those who do appreciate the golden age of story telling then this may be the book for you. Its a perfect book for those who are willing to get into the Spirit comic. Its also good required reading if you want to get into Darwyn Cooke's 'The Spirit' series currently being published at DC.
2,"Great strip, poor reproduction","After all the beautiful reproductions of the Spirit in magazines over the years it is surprising and disappointing to see such poor reproduction here. The color is so intense it almost obliterates the artwork in some panels, and the black line and letters are fuzzy. The stories are great, the Spirit is a treasure, but dig up some of the Warren or Kitchen Sink magazines instead. Even the old Harvey comic reprints were better than these. I haven't seen the DC Spirit Archives, but I sure wouldn't order them sight unseen after this."
4,great selection,"The Spirit is a classic in American comics. The series are being republished in very expensive volumes, but these are only for fans. This is a great one for starters - a good pick of the best Spiritstories. Only one minor minus here - the stories are printed on cheap paper. Hmm. Still a great collection for anyone who's unknown to the spirit."
4,Tired of the Watchers,"This episode ends up being full of clips from previous shows and passionate speeches. I guess it can't immortals all the time, but the watcher angle is wearing thin. Less talky more fight-y please."
2,why no subtitles,this is a great show to WATCH 0shame the sound is not -I would have found it quite useful to know what they are saying-Anchor appear to be one of the few producers to ommit Englis subtitles.Closed caption do noy workh in th UKPRINCE RAFAEL
5,This is the season not to miss,"Oh my, it's here and it's excellent! This is probably my favorite season of Highlander and all 22 of the episodes on 8 discs are entertaining and exciting. This is a definite must have for any Highlander fan or anyone who really enjoys martial arts and intriguing storylines. The bonus features alone are incredible and a definite must have. With commentary, bonus footage, and even a trivia game it just makes the series alot more behind-the-scenes and interactive with the viewer. I had to buy mine the first day it came out, so what are you waiting for? Go ahead and order or you'll be sorry."
1,AWFUL!,Forgot we had purchased this. Glad Amazon asked me to review. This piece of junk fell apart w/in 6 months. What a waste!
4,"Good, not great book","This book is a very good book for the student who is majoring in classical studies. It explains things clearly, yet not as clearly as one would hope."
2,Not what I expected,"I received this book as a gift. I like feng shui as good as the next person but I got lost with the application of how feng shui and its use of univeral principles (which is a term used loosly throughout) is demonstrated by the text. Sure, clean out your garage, yada, yada but in the end there aren't enough real world examples on real world outcomes to make a ""rich"" life. The title is refreshing but there's nothing new here. No offense, but I have to rank this one among the other 31 flavors of self help books."
1,The Art of Torah Cantillation,"Sorry, but I do not share the opinions of all of the other reviewers to date. My experience has been border-line frustrating.Unless you are willing to spend hundreds of hours with the book and CD, you will probably be quite disappointed as I am. Perhaps my age has an impact on how quickly I am able to learn the trope. But after reviewing the material for more than countless hours and reaching only lesson 16 out of a grand total of 84, I am about ready to donate the book and CD to charity.Furthermore, there are two cantors who share the instruction with obvious accents and even THEY do not perform the cantillations in a consistent manner. I would have preferred one ""American-style"" cantor. In addition, the male cantor may have received all kinds of awards but, in my opinion, he chants too quickly as though he has a train to catch. When I sing Hebrew, I like to savor each note and syllable. You will not find that style here."
3,GOOD PRODUCT BUT TAKE ABOUT IT USE,GOOD PRODUCT BUT TAKE ABOUT IT USE.CHILDREN MUST USE IT WITH PARENTAL SUPERVISION AND WITH PROTECTION MEANS LIKE A HELMET.
1,It is useless,"But due to the cost of shipment, etc, I do not want to bother to go through the hassle of returning it. It makes the connection between the outlet and your plug less secure because now between the plug-in and the outlet, there is the red rubber. The red rubber is also too short... they better redesign this product."
5,"Nada es Igual - One of Franco's best, new sounds and songs","This CD offers the listener new sounds like 'salsa' and 'bachata', with the usual excellence that characterizes the song writer/ interpreter Franco de Vita. It's very fresh and you can dance to many of the songs. I loved all songs, ""Lluvia"" and ""Nada es igual"" are great. This new recording comes in a different style, but has deep, meaningful songs you won't get tired of..."
2,que paso franco,"colecciono franco y este disco me decepciono mucho, 2 cancionesbuenas nada mas, si lo vas a comprar piensalo 2 veces antesporque la fusion no es buena y mucho y tipico de miami solopara ganarse la audiencia latina en miami creo que no esmuy bueno el disco."
4,"DE VITA, GENIAL - SONY, ESTAFADORA","Las canciones de este disco con excelentes. Pero me siento estafado por Sony. La razón? Las dos últimas canciones (""Te veo venir soledad"" y ""Lluvia"") están repetidas. Supuestamente tienen un ritmo diferente, pero la verdad es que las versiones son prácticamente iguales. Definitivamente no se justificaba repetir temas en un disco de un artista de esta categoría. No quiero creer que a Franco le ha ""faltado cuerda"" para presentar 11 canciones nuevas y que por ese motivo hayan repetido dos. Prefiero pensar que se debe a una deficiente producción y a una pésima decisión de la casa disquera. El artista se merece las cinco estrellas, Sony debería tener dos solamente. De todas formas el CD merece comprarse. Sony nos queda debiendo 8 minutos de música. Es una estafa, pero que le vamos a hacer..."
3,Re-issue from 2001,This was not my favorite Cheryl Holt novel but better than some of the books in this genre. I tended to skim some of the story because I just was not that interested in Penelope's character. The basic story is Lucas is the American angry that a Duke ( Penelope's father) got his single sister pregnant. He sets out for him to be aware of the child and then revenge by kidnapping Penelope. I finished it and it goes back to the Library today.

5,Nice,"I bought thiI bought this item to drill through 12"" cinder blocks. I wasn't optimistic but the price is good and a core drill rental is moderately expensive. This hole saw cut through the faces and web easily. I bored two of these and the teeth are still sharp. Each hole took about 20 minutes. I could have used water to lubricate and cool the saw but I didn't. The saw stayed cool and remained sharp."
1,This Maybe Lynn's Latest -- But It Is NOT Her Greatest!,"When I purchased this CD, I did so thinking that the classics on it were the original recordings. Lynn may have sung these songs, but you couldn't prove it by some of them.Particularly bad was the recording of Rocky Top. This song was the primary reason that I bought it, what a let down! It doesn't even compare with her original recording. Some of the other numbers were ok, but if your buying this for her classics -- I suggest you BE SURE YOU GET THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS."
3,FATAL FACE INDEED,"GROWING PAIN's Tracey Gold gets to bear her fangs as a psychotic young woman who kills people and takes their identities. Her latest: she kills a young college student and assumes her place at a ritzy little college where she sets her sights on her roomie's hunky and rich dad.Gold is quite good in the role, and she gets good support from Perry King as the dad and Shawnee Smith (SAW movies) as her goody two shoes roommate.It's all been done before but Gold is so despicable, you want to see her get her just desserts...but...no spoiler here!"
2,Not very good,"Because of the actors in this movie, I expected more than what the movie gave. Tracey Gold's character was not believable to me. Though she certainly was evil, it seemed to me that she was acting. I wasn't really drawn into the character. Perry King's character was too naive, as was Shawnee Smith's. I was glad when the film ended. I felt a little bored."
4,Lost treasure,"NT is a funky, rockin' R&B band that debuted at the wrong time (the '80s) and so this and his first record went completely unoticed which is a crime. NT and his band are a tour de force with a completely unique sound. This record is more a showcase for Nicholas as an artist and less about the band, but is still a great CD to have in your car at all times. Guest appearances by Maceo Parker, Bonnie Raitt, and Ivan Neville make the music just plain fun. Blues harpist Sugar Blue tears it up on ""Hold On Tight"" and Al Green's ""Rhymes"". I can't agree more with the other review that ""Wild with Care"" is just a great R&B tune as is ""River of Love"". Now someone at Island records or somewhere have the decency to re-release his first outing on CD because my casette is nearing extinction."
3,Not that useful for me. Need more detail!,It is a good dictionary but not great. I could not find alot of details from my dreams in there. So it was not that useful.
2,Some interpretation/disappointed,"If someone buys a book that interprets dreams, it is because they want to know what it means in terms of Omen, or insight into the future. This book is more like a psychology book explaining why you dream what you dream. I am not interested in why I dream what I dream. I am rather interested in what the dreams mean in my life in terms of how my life, my happiness and finances are and going to be. From a scientific standpoint maybe it is ok but otherwise in my opinion BS....."
2,incomplete information,i can't find some of the objects that i dreamed in this book. And the information is not clear enough.
5,"If you dream, and you do, you should have this book!","Never before has the science of dream interpretation beenmade so understandable. I have used this book thousands oftimes since I bought it about a year ago. The insight Dr.Condron offers from her own experience is invaluable todreamers, which we all are! I have even used this bookto help kids better understand their own dreams."
2,"okay, but a lot missing","There is too much left unsaid in this book for a novice...for instance, it will list a symbol such as ""run"" but not really give you clues as to what it means if someone is chasing you in your dream or you are just running...maybe i'm just a novice, but i need a little more information to understand the symbolism."
5,Best Dream Reference book ever!,When I was a young child I had nightmares constantly. After learning how to interpret my dreams I no longer was scared to go to sleep. The Dreamer's Dictionary written by Dr. Barbara Condronis amazing. It gives you many symbols and their meaning throughout the book as well as ways to learn how to interpret your own dreams or figure out symbols not included in the book. This I think is a must read for anyone wanting to understand their dreams or their life.
5,Men In Hats on Paper!,"I'm a big fan of Men In Hats, so of course I was excited when the book came out. With the high resolution strips printed in full color, it looks sharp. Also, there is a bonus long-form story in the back of the book, so it's more than just the strips you've seen online.I highly recommend this book."
2,Product picture needs updating and clarifying,"The pictured item is a ""corded"" leash. I received a ""tape"" leash which is exactly not what I wanted. Also it doesn't tell you the length of the leash. A large Flexi is usually 24feet. This one came to me as a 16foot. Now I have to return it and my dog is bummed."
4,Great Dog Leash,I got this for my pitbull last year for around $13 and it works very well. The leash is strong and has a good grip. Sometimes pushing the button down doesn't stop the leash until a few clicks later but nothing major. I would recommend this to people who need a strong leash. Disappointed they raised the price.
3,"Ok, but get a different version","Without looking at it closely, I bought this as a replacement to my existing 8 year old Flexi leash. The one I was replacing has the ribbon style leader which leads into a rope. I wish I had bought the same one I had previously.This leash:- Smooth action- No lead, so it will retract basically all the way (so no matter how close the dog is, it will pull your hand/arm towards the dog)- The ""STOPPER"" for the ribbon is not as strong as the stopper for the rope version- Made pretty well, even though the metal looking cover on the stopper disappeared on the first walk"
2,good design but not durable,"This leash looked great out of the package, nice re-spooling action and all, but when I put it onto my 4 month old in the house so he could get comfortable with using the included safety collar, he chewed through the tape in literally less than 3 bites! I realize that a dog will be able to chew through a lot of things eventually, but come one, this has got to be able to stand up to the ocasional nibble!"
1,Not very sturdy,"This leash is very light weight and has very smooth action. It also features a lock button and a lock set button that both work well. However, this tape measure style leash is very thin. I only had it 5 days before the cord snapped. All of the damage was inflicted during the occasional bites whenever the leash gets wrapped around my dog or a pole. The ribbon becomes tattered very quickly from the bites and then snaps. I would not recommend using this leash until your dog is completely disciplined to not snap at the leash."
4,More Freedom for dog,"I was a little nervous to use this retractable type leash after reading the warnings all over the packaging and the insert. Things like burning or cutting your skin if this thing snaps back on you. So when I tried it I was pretty cautious, but I soon got the hang of it. I did find that my dog got it wrapped around his legs several times..don't know if that was my fault or not. In the beginning, the lock was hard to engage.I did like that my dog had more room to roam and was not pulling me as much because of this. By the way, I have a 9 month old Golden Retriever named Jack. In his opinion, no leash is a good leash."
4,Flexi Classic 3 Retractable Tape Leash,"Bought this ""tape"" leash about a month ago to replace previous ""cord"" type leash.Pros: smooth, quiet operation compared to the cord type. Feels very durable and sturdy for my 22lbs jrt(very energetic little dog)Cons: a little heavy, and I wish the opening for the leash could be further away from the handle for better balance.Overall it's a satisfactory purchase."
3,Wrong description,"These leashes are amazing! Unfortunately, I was looking for the cord leash and not the tape leash. The seller had it listed as a cord leash when in fact it was a tape leash. The seller responded to all my e-mails in resolving the issue and sent a return postage paid envelope to return the product for a full refund since they didn't have the leash I wanted. So, even though it was a bummer not to get the product I wanted, I was impressed with how the seller resolved the issue."
1,"picture and description are wrong, says is a cord leash, but this came as a tape leash","I looked for a long time to find a cord retractable leash and finally thought that I found it in this item. The picture shows a cable leash, the product description says a cable leash but yet when I get it, it is a tape leash. Very disappointed."
1,Item not as pictured,"This is also my second Flexi leash I've purchased. They are both of excellent quality. However, this item is NOT as pictured. This 16' Large 110lb. leash does not come with the foot-long strap between the end of the cord and the collar latch -- it also does not have the cord as shown.I was quite disappointed and am returning for a full refund of shipping and purchase costs."
1,"Flexi Classic 3 Retractable Tape Leash, Large, 110lbs, Black 16ft","I was happy with the leash at first, it worked well. We have had it a little more than a month and the clasp broke off the end. Our dog is only 75 pounds and the leash is rated for 110. So I would not recommend this leash."
3,Not Really for Walking Siberians,"I boght two of these to walk my two Siberian Huskies and they can sometimes pull past the ""lock"" point on the leash. Not all the time but often enough that I won't walk my dogs near traffic with these leashes, and have decided they should only be used in the woods. It is possible that it is user error that I am not pushing the lock button hard enough, but either way not the leash for a strong and willful dog."
3,speed and strength,"I have bought about 7 of these. I have a border collie and he has figured out that if he can get wrapped around an object (pole, post,ect..) and run with force the line will snap.Until that happens, its great, but after its a paper weight."
1,beyond bad,"I purchased two of these leashes within 6 weeks. The first one snapped within two weeks, the second one snapped this morning.This is supposed to be for dogs up to 100 lb. Well, my 8 month old labrador retriever puppy weighs 50 lb now, and still the leash just snapped above the buckle! This product is crap to say the least. I am more than disappointed.Even tough it is easy to use and can be managed with one hand and just the thumb, the quality is very poor! If this would have happened on the street, God forbid, my dog might have been hit by a car. I am really angry and don't recommend this leash to anyone!!"
1,Cheaply made,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. I have a 4 month old labrador puppy that was able to break this in a few weeks. He did not chew through it but actually snapped it off where the leash attaches to the hook. He went running after a bird and got to the end of the line and just kept going, snapped clean off. I thought for sure it was his collar that broke but it was the leash itself. I'm going to try and get a refund. He was around 20lbs when it happened, this thing is supposed to be rated at 110lbs!"
5,"Uplifting, feel-good music!","David Forrest's original lyrics are spiritually uplifting without being preachy or religious. The arrangements are subtle allowing his clear voice and soulful lyrics front and center stage where they belong. This CD is so refreshing, I never tire of listening to it!"
5,Manfrotto 685B Neotec Monopod for Wedding Photography,"This monopod is very fast to set up and to make instant height adjustments. Pull up to extend, then squeeze the handle and safety lock and push down to shorten. It's not like other monopods that require knobs to be turned for adjustment. It has a lever at the base to step on so it can be held down with the foot while pulling up with one hand to extend it. Speed is critical in wedding photography, where this comes in handy to keep my camera steady in low light situations. I get so many more useable shots with this monopod. It also has a sturdy build. I recommended the Manfrotto 685B Neotec Monopod to my fellow wedding photographers in Indianapolis, and they commented that this is now an essential tool on every shoot. I use the Manfrotto 222 joystick head with this monopod for speedy camera adjustments."
5,Worth Every Cent,"I really like K&N Air Filters. I believe they are worth whatever amount is being charged. They can be rinsed and reused. I have a friend who has 2, because he can rinse one and use the other while he is waiting for the first one to dry. I would recommend this product to anyone, but especially to guys and gals who like 4-wheel driving. My boyfriend likes his 4X4, so I figured this would be a great investment, so we don't have to replace air filters so often."
3,"A nice insight into luthiers, but not all that comprehensive","Though I like the book, the highlights are more about the luthiers and not so much on the quality of the guitars they make. The book is layed out in a chronological order, and focuses on just one luthier and guitar per year.. This is confusing, as many luthiers produce guitars across 40,50 even 60 years. So, this approach doesn't really work for me.The book could have benefited from a comparison of major achievements introduced by each luthier, and focused on broad comparisons of different guitars. It instead focuses on the personalities of the luthiers.If the reason you want to purchase the book is to help you find a concert guitar, this book will provide a good reference to the major luthiers operating today. However, if you are looking to find distinguishing features about the guitars, you will be hard pressed to do so, as the book provides just a few tidbits of information in that regard."
1,Not what it claims,"For people interested in a detailed discussion of different types of guitar it may be just the ticket, but I was looking for something more general. There is precious little information about players, composers, repertoire, etc.This book is for people interested in the construction of guitars and it's not really a ""History of the Classical Guitar"" as I understand the expression.It's all very well for Amazon to say we can have a refund. What they don't tell you is that you have to post it back to America - and it's a large and heavy book!"
5,great athelete food book,"Within 3 weeks of implementing the basic concepts I noticed a massive difference in my ability to train productively on successive days and that my soreness after long runs of 10-20 miles was drastically cut.One of the great things about this book is that you can apply it's concepts in a macro or micro level pretty easilly, from grams to food groups to eating for specific training cycles.The organization and layout could use some cleaning up, but the content makes up for it. It has plenty of sample diets, though it could use a little more.Truly outstanding!"
3,Disappointed,"I was looking for advice on losing weight. It is really difficult to train and lose more than just a few pounds at the same time, and I figured that this book would at least give a few pointers. A blurb on the cover says ""Lose weight"" but once you get into the book there is little information. The word Weight is not even in the index. The short chapter on Wisdom for Older Athletes was good, but it's only 6 pages long. I'm going to check out the book Racing Weight which looks interesting."
3,Good Book - Highly Technical,"This is a very thorough book, and mostly too thorough for the ""average"" and even serious recreational rider. If you are an aspiring pro, or even a serious racer, this is a wonderful book for you. If you're simply looking for a book to help you with your ""fitness"" in regard to exercise, you'll be way too confused when you finish this one...if you can finish it."
5,Cristina's review,"Certainly, the book Food for Fitness - Chris Carmichael (author) has been a nice and interesting experience for me.Brings all details in nutrition for people who enjoy sports, to maximize their performance.I'm really satisfied."
2,Book too long and boring,"I really didn't read it as it is too long and does not keep my interest at all. I have read other books in the past like ""Body for Life"" and found them very informative and short and to the point."
3,"Beware: This book is an identical copy of the AHPAT, by...","Beware: This book is an identical copy of the Ahpat : Complete Preparation for the Allied Health Professions Admission Test Williams, Wilkins Review / Paperback / Published 1998"
2,Great Look But Very Low Quality,"When I bought this watch, I must say that the shiny look of it got me. However, I didn't realize that the movement (Philippines movement) was such low quality. I still wear the watch but I would not buy it again if I ever had to do so."
1,Hangs funny,"Even if you have the body of a goddess, it's gonna hang funny. Def a bikini piece. No way to really wear it under clothes comfortably"
3,Its ok,I love the design but I don't wear it that often because sometimes when moving around or just sitting it will pull on ur bellybutton.
3,Black Tribal Shield Bellly Button ring,"Works well. I thought it would be flashier. I will wear it only to dance in because it does not work well with street clothes, it digs in to my tummy. The ring is well made and arrived promptly. I will buy more form this seller"
4,"Cute, but not entirely my style",Got this earlier on this week. I like it but idk seems a little too gothic-y for me...or maybe that's not even the word. My main problem with it is that from a distance people can't tell what's happening around your navel because it just looks like black lol. However it does go well with my black bathing suits so that's why it's getting a relatively high rating since that is the reason I bought it. I just don't see me wearing it much with anything else that I already have.
3,I Dunno,"It's pretty, but not as nice as it looks in the picture. I like it- but it's not my favorite, due to the fact it digs into my belly sometimes and it's not as flashy as it's pictured."
5,Live Worship with Chris Falson and The Amazing Stories,It doesn't get any better than this. This is one of Chris Falson's best works.
5,Classic of classics in Jazz,"Amazon lists this as # 24 in his catalog of albums. I think this is by far one of his best, at least a top 5, as for me this is my favorite of all my 20+ Monk albums. Green Chimneys, In Walked Bud and Boo Boo's birthday are among some of the best songs he has ever written. This era in Monks music had his best line up of musicians including Charlie Rouse and Ben Riley. If you know your Jazz you will know what a great album this is. If you are just starting a Jazz collection, this is a great addition. If you are new to Monk, try a Greatest Hits. The bonus tracks are a great bonus."
5,worth evry penny,"A bit more expensive then other strings, But theire worth it, the tone is outstanding, They last a long time, they never rally come out of tune..... and they do last 3x5times longer then any other string I've tryed. The sustain is great they give a nice soth blusey thone, Not to dark not to bright Just perfect.These string's are worth it!"
2,Heroine is too stupid!,"Although the book was well written, the heroine was too stupid and silly! I really detest novels where the hero is all knowing and wise to the ways of the world, and the heroine is a silly, completely innocent youngster who has to be rescued over and over again.Elizabeth actually fit much better with Lord Dearborne's ward Kit. He was her age and developed a friendship with Elizabeth. Lord Dearborne could have been her father and frankly seemed only interested in two things: Elizabeth's physical beauty and laughing at her expense!I also dislike books where the hero never tells the heroine what's really going on, so she keeps falling into trouble. As far as the mystery goes, you could see from the very first time he entered the book that the villain was up to no good.A much better book is ""Poetic Justice"" by Alicia Rasley. In that book, the hero and heroine are much better matched. They are true kindred spirits - of the mind as well as the body."
1,Another example of liberal bias,"This book gave me bad vibes just from the title. The author tends to group non-violent/patriotic groups with racists and extremists. This is nothing new. Angry liberals have always linked their foes with criminals. This is the process of vilification.It is a shame that people who don't know much about this subject must read this book because they are getting a very biased view of the topic. For example, there are many militia groups out there which are non-violent and defensive in nature. The author fails to mention this.In conclusion, this book is NOT fair and balenced, but very bias toward the far left. My advice to someone looking at this book is don't waste your time and money. This book is not worth the purchase."
5,Life Changing!,This wonderful DVD has changed my life! I bought it years ago before this new and improved version came out. I loved the old one but the new one has an even better menu with more poses and you don't have to get down on the floor. It was a perfect fit for because I needed clear directions with yoga exercises that I could really do! I also got really good results with Suzanne Andrews Pain Free Back and Neck DVD as I have a bad back and am overweight and the other DVD's were too hard and complicated. With this special DVD I feel relaxed and sleep better at night. Suzanne Andrews is the best teacher she knows how to explain what to do and when to do it at a easy pace . I think it's special because I have tried others and nothing compares to this one!Functional Fitness: Pain Free Back & Neck with Suzanne Andrews
5,Perfect!,"These holders are perfect for holding catalogs or magazines in binders...just what I was looking for! They came quickly, too!"
4,Good product.,Great product to take wine along for the ride. Would recommend this to any other winos. Wish I had more wine though.
1,Don't Know - Never Received Item,"I ordered this item 11/23 for Christmas and it never arrived. I think it would have been a great gift for my brother-in-law, but I may never know."
2,Will Not Hold Wider 750 ml Bottles,"We just cannot squeeze wider 750 ml bottles, such as Bogle Chardonnay, into the 2-bottle tote. The same wine bottle fits fine in the single bottle tote. A real shame."
4,Works fine,"I bought two styles...this one and one with a flap. The other came in a bright color. At the time, this one was only offered in black. It works great, but I kept the other one since it is bright red and I am less likely to leave it at the resturant. This one ""disappears"" in the shadows. Works great and is worth the money."
4,Wine tote,"These wine totes are great for carrying wine securely, and are even more useful when packing wine in suitcases for travel."
3,When thin is too thin....,"The Built Neoprene Tote has been around for a while....I loved the one I had but somehow mislaid it....while the price has reduced in the interim, so has the width! The latest offering feels insubstantial and one wonders if it is strong enough to support two overweight bottles given that these seem to proliferate nowadays.I am still giving it 3 stars though as getting two of these for $19.95 represents decent value, assuming that the product is fit for purpose...I am just a tad unhappy that its somewhat flimsy nature makes it less pleasant to tote (no pun intended!) around."
1,Forget about it,I'd rather be gnawed by a platapus. The movie was good but the soundtrack needs work.
4,Happiness Indeed!,"""As much as she'd like to believe, she's leading a brand new way..."" This band is quirky and fun and the show on this DVD is a good one. The thing I like so much about TPOH is their vocal harmonies. There's a certain sound that the female backing singers create when their voices combine. The sound has what I call a ""pleading"" quality. Abba had it. I wish I knew the right terms to describe it. If you like TPOH, you'll enjoy the concert. If not, you might enjoy it anyway!"
3,Disappointed,"I thought this would include the card deck that is supposed to go with the book, but it did not. The book looks like it would be a fun oracle to play with, but without the cards it seems almost useless."
3,Fiskars Garden Fork,"This product is designed for men to use. It is a pitty they do not make a lighter, smaller version for women. I have found it sturdy but too heavy and cumbersome to use for long periods of time. It always amazes me how little manufacturers think of women when they design products and in the case of gardening tools, women are often active users of such tools so the oversight is all the more egregious."
2,My wife broke mine trying to remove a Juniper shrub,My wife broke mine trying to remove a Juniper shrub. I am looking for something stronger.
2,Of Little Use!,"This book is of little use. It is also very hard to read, especially with the enormously large note section, and the fact you must consult the notes to understand the point being made. The authors continued reference to the book ""Stolen Valor"" is an issue. If you have not read the book and/or have the book in your personal library you will be at a loss, also. I have read ""Stolen Valor"" and have the book and it is an excellent read and reference book. Sorry I can't say the same for ""Fake Warrior"". It is a waste of time and money!!"
2,Interesting but:,"Interesting to those of us who are intriqued by the phenomeon of these people who did everything they could to avoid or deny any part in Vietnam at the time, but now wish to claim not only being a part of the action, but also heroes on the battlefield and usually part of some obscure secret unit.The book does bog down eventually and seems to just rehash a lot of similiar incidents."
1,Incompetent,"I wouldn't take anything these two write at face value, even if they were writing their own names.They have proven themselves incompetent in reading simple military documents and too lazy to obtain original-source information in analyzing those documents, most notably in their ludicrous claims about John Kerry's Silver Star citations. Not only did the Navy Inspector General's office put the matter to rest in its 2004 investigation and report, numerous journalists - including Rowan Scarborough of the conservative Washington Times - exercised basic research skills in settling the question.Evidently Hank and Erika didn't even bother to read other people's research before making total fools of themselves. Let it stand as a monument to their intellectual laziness."
5,Folding music stand,"This a a nice stand. It folds into a small size for easy transport. I use it to equipment manuals instead of music sheets, and it is sturdy enough to hold a small or medium sized manual."
4,Well made!,"Believe it or not, this is NOT made in China like Everything else is. It's made in Germany; however, the stand is not intuitive regarding setting it up. This is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. Even with the instructions, it took some head scratching to get the book holder folded out. Now that it's fully set up, it holds even my heaviest music binder. It's also tall enough to glance at when I'm rehearsing my Arias and Oratorios."
4,Fabulous stand,"I bought this as a gift for my father, and he absolutely loves it. We were visiting a family member who had this stand and my father couldn't stop commenting on it. He loves that it folds up so small into pieces, but is still so sturdy. The shelf is substantial enough for a book, but still works well with sheet music. Very nice stand, and I'm glad I could track it down on Amazon."
2,It's a bit fussy!,"I too am a professional carpenter and woodworker, and look closely at a tool before I buy it. The Metabo is well designed, comfortable to use, and was recommended by my trusty, local repair shop. That said, my sander is now in that repair shop, after very little use. The problem is with the dual sanding control. This sander is capable of sanding in either a finer and gentler mode, or in a faster but rougher mode. Switching from one to the other is simple. You just depress a button on the side of the tool and revolve the disc in reverse direction until it ""clicks"". Then you're ready to go. Unless the little button sticks in the depressed position, which will lock up the tool rendering it useless. That is what happened to me, after very few hours and with careful use. Maybe this is just a fluke, but I'll be more reluctant to buy other Metabo tools."
4,"""Cadillac"" of sanders","After using 5"" sanders for years, this 6"" is a dream. I researched them quite a bit, the Metabo is solid, hooks up to my vacuum easily, has comfortable handles and the detachable front handle is easy to change. The variable speed dial is tough to adjust, and the rubber dust hood above the base pad sometimes comes loose and rubs against the orbiting base. Stop immediately if that happens, take off base, press/snap down the dust hood. The dust bag works as well as any of them, but this one is stronger and easier to empty than most."
2,Fell apart quickly,"I got this for my laundry travels. I live in Boston and the sidewalks aren't exactly smooth surfaces. However the front wheels bent within four 1/4 mile trips to and from the laundromat. The back wheels still work, but I'd spend money for something sturdier."
3,Very good cart,This cart could use better wheels but all in all it is a great product. Does not handle stairs very well and does not turn you must pick it up from the back and make it turn. But it has been a great back saver and rcently injured my left arm and it came in handy with things that needed to be moved from the car to my apartment.
5,Cooking on a slow burner!,"A terrific set of blowing blues by piano great Copley and members from the Fabulous Thunderbirds. You drop into an intimate after hours jam session where Copley takes center stage and the other fine musicians sit in with superb supporting licks and a willingness to be in the swinging backround. Count Basie must have been an influence, along with Professor Longhair, as they would refer to this set as ""cooking on a low burner"". Mighty fine bubbling blues."
4,Great Jazz,And it goes something like this:The hills are aliveWith the sound of musicWith songs they have sungFor a thousand yearsThe hills fill my heartWith the sound of musicMy heart wants to sing ev'ry song it hearsJust kidding. No words Good album. Buy it
4,Doesn't Anybody Have this LP?,"How come Earl Thomas Conley doesn't get any reviews? Just doesn't seem right. I've had this for quite some time, though it was tough to find. I only became aware of the CD because a friend has several co-writes on it. I'm not sorry I bought it; really has some nice cuts and it's a real nice change of pace. Good job."
5,Edifying and visually stunning,"Whether you believe what you see or not, this motion-picture is gripping and intense. Although he is often very low-key, Kevin Costner was made for this performance. There were times when I was convinced he was his character. Terrific cameos with Walter Matthau, Brian Doyle Murray and Kevin Bacon. Oliver Stone accomplished the impossible by telling such a big story with so many people and without once confusing anyone. This is a must see for history buffs and conspiracy-theorists."
3,great!!!!,"the poser is dead!!!!!!! mclaren was a opportunist!!!! he had a chance with the sex pistols to destroy rock'n roll, but anyway duck rock is the opposite!!! african music, beginning of rap!!!!!malcolm at his best, great album!!!"
5,Beautiful Read,"This is a fantastic read aloud book. I like how it is a story about helping and adventure. The other snails were afraid to venture out, but the tiny snail taught them a lesson on how to enjoy life!"
5,As good as Donaldson's other works,Loved the prose and illustrations -- so fun to read aloud to my boys. The story also has a nice life lesson about never being to small to help a friend.
4,A fabulous book,This is another brilliant book by the author of the Gruffalo. Would recommend this book to others. Great for children of Primary age.
1,Be careful to order the correct book,"I'm not sure why, but if you click on the ""Paperback"" version of this book, you will get the ""Activity Book"" and not the actual book. You need to click on ""Mass Market Paperback"" to get an actual copy of the book. I'm going to keep the ""Activity Book"" because 1) Not worth paying to ship it back and 2) it looks like it might be more fun after we actually read the story. But just wanted people to be beware that they are getting the right book when ordering."
5,Fabulous,Another great rhyming book from Julia Donaldson. She does a great range of books and they appeal to adults and kids. They are so easy to read and it is a joy to follow the simple yet exciting stories. She is a gifted story teller and the illustrations are just intriguing.
3,Not for a young toddler,"We purchased this book because my two year old son enjoyed Room on the Broom. Unfortunately I think the book is for an older child so it's spent most of the time on my son's bookshelf, untouched. We tried to read through it once but 3/4 through the story, my son was asking for another book instead! He has refused further offers to read the story again. The writing is much more complex, the sentences are long and the story in itself is a bit too winding for my 2.5 year old boy. We hope to begin enjoying it in a year or so."
5,A wonderful tale,"I'm always looking for good books for my grandkids, ages 3 and 20 months, and this one fits my criteria perfectly. It has a great message, rhyming words make it fun to read, and the illustrations are superb. It's one of their favorites."
5,A beautiful book,We received this book at a birthday party and fell in love with its sweet story. Now we give it as a gift to everyone else!
5,The Snail and the Whale,My 3-year-old grandson has asked to have this book read to him every night since I gave it to him. My daughter says he also wants to discuss it in detail. So glad I bought it for him.
5,The first album,"I own the the first leatherwolf album in vinyl. It's pretty good. Season of the witch was the first song I remember listening from Leatherwolf. The album has a wolf on the cover. Now I was looking for it in cd but I am having difficulties find it because is not available anymore. This albulm to me is the best album from Leatherwolf.Do you want to find out more about Leatherwolf? Log into their web page ""leatherwolf.com"" and you will see what they're up to. They have a couple of new songs that you can listen to. They are pretty good. If you like Leatherwolf you're gonna dig their new tunes. Check it out!!!"
3,"Long, warm, soap opera","My rating may be deceptive as I would not have finished all 728 pages of this book if I had not enjoyed it. I was in the mood for a good WW II novel, but this is really a soap opera with a World War II backdrop. Coming Home is too long by half, filled with endless descriptions of everything: clothes, scenery, people, probably pillowcases and cooking pots. At scene painting, Pilcher is outstanding. She made me want to visit Cornwall. The scenes of English country life in the 1930s were idyllic -- too idyllic -- and the heroine is too goody-goody to be believed, but the scenes of loss and longing in wartime were effective. Pilcher is good at tugging on the heartstrings and she knows how to tell a story."
2,A verbal portrait English aristocracy in the 30's and 40's,"I was initially bored and impatient with the endless detailed discriptions of trivia and the slow moving, halting story line. It eventually dawned on me that the author was not telling a story but was painting a picture of the life of English aristocracy during the latter part of the 1930's and the war years and that the story was merely a vehicle to tie the parts of the picture together."
1,Coming Home,"This book ""Coming Home"" arrived on time...But some of pages the print is above the page and cannot be read --Plus the last page is missing!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Some interesting characters, some predictable characters","I've read the book 3 times, so I must find it worthwhile. Some very good characterizations: Judith, Gus, Jess and some very interesting relationships that I wish had been developed more fully. Unfortunately, there were some central casting characters as well: Diana is straight out of a 1930's MGM movie. But many of the scenes Pilcher writes (especially Judith's reunions with Jess and Gus) seem true to life and that's what you'll remember. My I recommend Elizabeth Jane Howard's Cazalet Chronicles to any of you who liked this book? Starting with ""The Light Years"", this series of 4 books tells the story of an English family from 1938 to 1947. An excellent work!"
5,Rosamunde Picher books,This was right up there with the Shell Seekers as one of this author's best--I had difficulty putting it down!!
3,Not LARGE Print,"Great author, but book came up under search for LARGE PRINT books......It is not Large Print! Amazon needs to fix this in how they present items."
3,Good Story but...,"I think I would have enjoyed this book more if I hadn't seen the movie first. The movie was quite different from her book. The specific scenes that I was really interested in reading about were not the same , or not there at all. I love the characters in her books! She has a way of making you live thru them."
5,This book was the best book I have ever read.,"This is by far the best book Rosamunde Pilcher has ever written. The characters are extremely well developed, and it captures your attention from the beginning to the very last page."
5,I would give this book 10 stars if I could,"Rosamunde Pilcher is an inspiring writer. I have loved her books for years and have re-read this title so many times. Every time a character dies, I burst into tears as if I'm reading it for the first time. Judith Dunbar is such a strong character and her life is extraordinary. The Carey-Lewis's are also so well-written, you feel like you've always known them. There is not a page in this book that is not exquisite. When I read this book, I always come home again and again!"
5,One of the best historical-romances ever written!!,I loved this book. It takes you back to a time that was confusing but yet still seems simpler. It was wonderfully written and contained a great deal of detail. I loved this book and I would recommend it to anyone who truly loves to read.
5,Probably the best book I have ever read!,Just had to write in and say that this book by Rosamunde Pilcher was awesome. The story was wonderful and the characters really stay with you. I highly recommend this book - it is a must! You will not be sorry!
4,Beyond Basics,"This is a well rounded book to help anyone learn the basics of html to the more advanced tools available. This is the second book I have purchased by Paul H. Zimmerman and both have been very useful. Each section contains a discussion of the topic/process, good design tips and a step by step guide to walk you through the mechanics of the process. This books provides a good foundation so that you have the confidence to explore other parts of FrontPage 2000. In addition, it serves as a good reference guide when working on html pages (including frames)."
2,Sword Canes Cheap,"This thing would be more practical as a club- its heavy. The blade bounces back and forth in the aluminum sheath always giving a distinctive clanking sound when walking. The artwork is nice, but quality is lacking with the blades. Some are sharpened, some are dull. The head must be unscrewed. There seems to be no quality control here. The screw may have 3-5 threads and is too slow in a sudden tactical situation. Use it as a club! Turn the cobra head sideways to fit into the hand properly. Concealed weapons are illegal in most states."
2,there are way better receivers out there,"Save your cash, buy a different stereo, it works ok, but the buttons/dial/toggle seriously suck. You will get pissed at the design of this thing. So annoying"
2,Not happy,"I like the radio but I have a problem with the volume button. Its too sensitive..Every time I touch the button to turn the volume up or down, I got into all the different settings. Overall I'm not happy with this radio."
1,Not A Good Buy,"I was not happy with this purchase at all, From day one of this cd player in my car, it would skip everytime you turn the car or hit a little bump. It was actually embarrasing when you are blasting music and everytime you turn, people stare at you because of how it skips. I learned now and got rid of it right away and purchased a much better buy that does not skip."
2,Desparately Need Updating,"I traveled to Italy in October of 2002 and spent one month there, relying on Bed and Blessings for accurate information on where to stay inexpensively. I was truly dissapointed. I ended up finding fellow travellers to be a more reliable source of information than ""Bed and Blessings.""This book has not been updated since 1999 and over half the places I called did not have correct phone numbers in the book. Others were out of business or converted to hotels. Also, Italy now uses the Euro which is not listed in the book. One place listed in the book where I stayed, had fleas and they sufficiently dined on me. I fled the place the next morning to a local hotel.Julia needs to get busy updating the information in the book if she wants to continue to sell it as a useful reference. I would not buy it again unless it is updated."
4,Very useful book,I recently returned from a trip to Italy. I stayed in one of the Rome convents referenced in this book and found the accommodations to be exactly as described in the book. The nuns were gracious and helpful and the room was very plain but clean and comfortable. I highly recommend the book for anyone traveling to Italy on a budget.If you are using public transportation I recommend purchasing a detailed street map of Rome to help pinpoint the location of some of the properties referenced in the book.
1,Bed and Blessings Italy: A Guide to Convents and Monasteries Available for Overnight Lodging,"The book had a lot of valuable information about the topic; however, it was published in 1998, and my concernt is that some of the information is outdated."
1,Bed and Blessings: Italy,"I felt this small, thin book was a poor value for the scant information it contains."
1,out of date!,I was very disappointed in this book. The information is very old and rather inadequate. The publisher should revise this book or withdraw it from the marketplace.
5,This CD On Sale!,"While this album is well worth $25+ dollars, it's available for $6 PPD at The New Beat Records website. What are you waiting for?"
4,Good book,"We enjoy many of John Butler's books. I like that he uses different animals in the books. This book is good, we love ""Can You Cuddle like a Koala?"" and ""Can You Growl Like a Bear?"""
3,An Uplifting CD!,I really enjoy the music on this CD. This is my first Keb Mo album. If you enjoy the music samples then I highly recommend JUST LIKE YOU. This music will lift your spirits and altogether make you feel good!
1,Keb PLEASE NO Mo Like This Again!,"His 1st disc was full of promise for a great future, but like MANY other supposed talents this is a typical ""I've already used all my good stuff"" discs. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this! (I did and I sure wish I had 1 more wish, so I wouldn't have bought this!) If this is ""Just Like You"" then You should go back to where you were!"
4,Just Like You,"This is quite a good CD. It is smoothe and easy to listen too. It is likeable by all types of people and there is a song for everybody on this CD. Keb'mo is quite a good lyricist and he is an eccelent guitar player, taking a similar style to Taj'Mahal and other outstanding blues players. If you want a good CD to listen to at parties, this is it. All together, Keb'mo's CD is Outstanding."
4,Great CD,Great acoustic blues. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because his first one was better and deserves the 5.
5,"Clean, simple, soulful and smooth",Clean Blues without the over-the-top screaming guitar solos that get old fast. It's soulful music that you can listen to over and over again. A perfect blend of modern down home country blues. A must buy.
5,Channeling Heaven on Earth,"Keb' Mo' is special. He is showing us how to be with each other - a modern day prophet. Listen up, everyone! We need all the Keb' Mo' we can get."
5,Great Book!,"Amazing book, great compilation of ALL New Yorker comics. This is a must have in your library or as a fun table book. Huge, heavy book. Highly recommended!"
5,My favorite Amazon purchase ... so far!,The book was in perfect condition! The cartoons brought back all the memories of reading my Dad's New Yorker magazine ... when I was a kid. Great fun ... and a super conversational book for the table.
5,Can't go wrong with New Yorker cartoons,Sometimes it's tricky selecting Xmas gifts for boys and men and tis selection of New Yorker cartoons was immensely enjoyed.
2,Disappointment Due to Deception,"This book/CD project had great potential but was spoiled for me by its deceptive advertising and packaging. Obviously a computer which reads CDs would be necesssary but nowhere in the advertising or the book and its packaging is mention made of the software (operating system and reader) necessary to view the CDs. You have to make a purchase and open the package and try the CDs before you learn that. I work with CDs on my preferred computer but had to borrow another in order to view these CDs...and then, like one of the other reviewers, was disappointed in the quality."
5,should have 1000 stars,"Hysterical.Example:A very old man laying in bed, someone quietly sitting next to him holding his hand; presumably the old man is dying. The old man says, ""I wish I had bought more crap.""I'm still laughing.Great Xmas gift. I am giving it."
2,it's partly the cd,"that brings my rating down to 2 stars.i have a very advanced, nearly state of the art cpu and monitor. i can't read the captions on the most of the cartoons. they're pertectly legible if i print them out, but that's hardly a sensible solution.the other part of the low rating is the size of the book. obviously, the book industry has become infatuated with huge tomes lately. i would have preferred two, or even three, volumes of a size that could be read comfortably in a chair or in bed. unless i buy an actual lectern, i have nowhere in my house to put this book where i can read it casually or easily.as most reviewers do, i love the new yorker cartoons. i'm glad to have the collection, but i wish i could enjoy it more easily."
1,Product should not be on the market,The book is outstanding (hence one star) but the New Yorker is engaging in a form of fraud for claiming that the CDs contain all the cartoons ever published. In actual fact the CDs are of such low resolution that MANY of the cartoons cannot be interpreted because the caption or even the entire drawing is illegible. If a drawing is too illegible to interpret it is the same as not being included. I love the cartoons of the New Yorker and it was incredibly frustrating browsing the CDs and repeatedly finding cartoons that simply cannot be read. Enlarging them doesn't help. You WILL get a headache. The publisher should retract their claim and remove the illegible cartoons from the CDs. And shame on them for foisting this on those of us who truly love their cartoons.
5,I have never seen the book,"It was a gift I bought for somebody else, but the person who received it, took picture of it and she was so happy with the book that I have to rate it 5 stars. Maybe I will buy one for myself too...who knows."
5,the complete cartoons of new yorker,"Pleased with the book, but not with two having been sent to my California son rather than just the one I gifted. As well, having two charges for the one ordered book on my Visa card. Kindly help to remove one of themn. Thank you"
1,Does the plagerizing continue?,"Janet Dailey has admitted to taking ideas for her stories from Nora Roberts. When the main character dies in this book, which is very unusal for romances, I had to wonder if she took that idea from the book, ""Message in a Bottle."" I will never again be able to read her books without wondering where the ideas and content came from."
3,Disappointed,"I was so excited about buying this latest book since I had read all of the Calder books and enjoyed them very much. However, I was so disappointed that the love story between Jessy and Ty Calder ended the way it did. Ty dying left me feeling that I wished I had never read it. I like to read a book and feel good with the ending. This one left me feeling depressed. Jessy spent all her life in love with Ty and was left alone again at the end. There was just nothing left at the end to say this book, Green Calder Grass was enjoyable reading."
1,Not a Romance novel,"IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING, DON'T READ ANY FURTHER... While I think there were some romantic themes to this story, my definition of a romance novel includes a happy ending, not one where the love interest dies a tragic death at the end, leaving his family (including two young children) in turmoil. The book is incorrectly labeled as a contemporary romance. I buy romance novels because of the happy ending... I won't purchase any more of her books."
1,What a disappointment!!!!!,"Maggie and Chase's story was one of the first Janet Dailey books I ever read and I loved it so much!!! When Janet Daily killed off Maggie in Stands a Calder Man I swore I would never read her books again. Then Calder Pride came out and instead of buying it I got it at the library and read it and was pleasantly suprised. I was so excited when Green Calder Grass came out that I bought it as soon as it was on the shelf. Well, Ms. Dailey, you suckered me again. I can not believe that Ty died in this book. Talk about no romance! This time I'm sticking to my guns. I will never read/buy another Janet Dailey book again!"
2,green calder grass,"This book was a major disapointment. Through out the book I found myself wondering when the ""romance"" would begin. Not only was no chemestry between Ty and Jessie but no passion at all. When I was finished I was not left with the warm feeling most ""romance"" stories will leave you with but a feeling of frustration at the ending. Without giving the ending away I can only say I would never have bought the book or spent my time reading it if I had known the outcome. If you are looking for a book that will leave you with a warm fuzy feeling, this is not it. I will definatly think twice before I by another book by Ms. Dailey."
1,Not Surprised!,"I read the first four books in this series years ago. After reading Ty and Jessica's story, I decided not read anymore of her books. Killing Maggie was the reason. Curiosity got the better of me years later. Ms. Dailey loves killing off lockable characters. The next three books in the series were ok, but not a reason to read the remaining books. I'm going back to my original decision. No more Janet Dailey for me."
1,WHY!,"Tell me Ms. Dailey--WHY? Why did you have to write this book! I was awake for hours angry at what you did. The Calder series introduced me to romance books, never again!"
3,I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I GOT WEARY OF READING,This was not one of the best books I have read. Janet could have left Tara out completely in this story. She dominated the storyline and left Jessy and the twins out. Ty never seemed to spend time with his children. I just go plain out done with the story and skipped from about from 351 to 380. There was Jessy waiting on Tara and out riding the range in the roundup while Tara was spending time with Ty.I am very disappointed in the writer.
3,I Expected More From the Book!,"By reading the synopsis, I thought that this book would be far more dramatic than it was. It was okay enough to get through, but it seemed to bore me in a lot of places.Ty and his wife Jessy are happily expecting twins. But Tara, Ty's ex-wife is very angry about their divorce, and wants to ruin everything for his new family. So she takes over their lives, and the more she gets involved, the more troublesome things become. Unexpected accidents occur, and Jessy feels that Tara is behind it all. The story jumps from one point to the other, and was underdeveloped I felt. I lost where Tara went in between all these troubles."
2,Not her best work,"This book was a major disappointment to a fan of most all of Janet Daily's novels. I generally like for there to be a little fire between the central characters. There seemed to be more chemistry between Chase and Buck than Ty and Jessy.Also, I know this is just fiction but I think I hate Tara. She annoys me and just seems to detract from the story of two people who are very in love and trying to start a family while running a huge ranch. Having Ty die at the end of the story made me wish she had just quit with Calder Pride. I am sure I will probably read the next books, but I might wait until they come out in paperback next time."
2,Disapointed,"I was really enjoying Green Calder Grass until the death of Ty.I have read and loved all the Calder books, that is why I was so disapointed in the killing of the main character.The surprise ending was not worth killing off Jessy's husband, Chase's son and the twins father.This is a fictional story, I wish Janet Dailey would have made it end better."
3,Very upset & disappointed in the end!,"I really loved the series but found it difficult when Maggie died. When Ty was killed I was so upset I couldn't stop crying, it ruined it for me. I just don't know if I can put myself through that again."
5,Soooooooooo good!,"I have had this CD for a couple of years, and I just got it out the other night. Had to listen to it again as I wait for his new CD to arrive. Man oh man, this is good. I dare you to put this CD on and NOT get moving. This could be his best, but I reserve judgment until the new one (""Jackpot"") arrives."
1,BIG disappointment!,"Don't let the picture they show fool you. It's one of the only decent pictures in the whole book! The rest of the pictures were really disappointing compared to that!Other problems I had with this book... there are false deities or mythological figures in it, which some may not exactly appreciate. Secondly, while it LOOKS like one of the many coloring books out there aimed at adults, it's got big-print words in it like it's for kids. I would never give a kid that needs words that size, pictures that would require this much detailed coloring. The kid would go nuts trying to do it. And adults will probably find it disappointing after seeing the picture they show here.Maybe it's just me but, I really did not care for this at all."
1,Frozen or maybe not,"We bought this soft serve ice cream/frozen yogurt maker for my cousin for her birthday, and When we tried it the first time we thought maybe we just put too much liquid in the first time, so we tried a different recipe. That one also did not freeze. It does not seem to get cold enough for ice cream. But instead you get to eat some ice cream soup. Personally I like ice cream soup at the end of my ice cream (reminds me of childhood sitting at the table with my brother and us stiring our ice cream till it was soup), but do not like to start with it. I would definitely not buy this product ever again. In fact we are planning on sending it back."
2,Okay but not exactly what it advertises,"Well, I found this at a thrift store for about $9 so I don't have any hard feelings about it not working that well. I also made some really great ice cream with it though not quite as easily as it advertises. I found that after following all the directions I had to pour out the ice cream soup into another container and refreeze it. Then, after it hardened up enough it was great, albeit not soft serve. Sadly the freezer container fell out of the freezer and craked and all the chemical inside melted out while I mixed the last batch. At the prices they want for a new one I wouldn't recommend it at all. But I wouldn't hesitate to buy another for $9!"
1,Horrid and Pathetic,"An unengaging, unendearing tale about five privelidged girls and their ""trials"" at an East Coast boarding school. Taking place in the early 60s, it's supposed to paint a picture of these pampered young women and the dilemma of a changing society--one where polished social graces and charm are no longer required or respected. Tragic, huh?It's actually the story of spoiled, self-absorbed teenagers. I didn't care about any of them; I was just glad to be finished with them.It really deserves no stars."
