3,wrong image,"OK, first off, the image they are using is for the lee load master, NOT the lee pro 1000. shipping was fast and ahead of schedule. instructions are not helpful at all but that is easily remedied with the help of youtube. I'm going to put a hundred round test lot through the press and see how it holds up. more details then"
1,This is not the book you hope it is,"The Blue Jays were the first back to back champs since some decades. The two World series they played in were exciting and the last ended with a home run on one run down, two outs and a full count. That series also had a thrilling extra inning game in Philadephia. But I did expect a lot more from this book than just a dull account of facts, similar to what I wrote here. Pictures and statistics, for instance. But no, this is one dull book with all the wrong pictures and a text that seems to be written on a lazy afternoon at the office. ""Coffee Lou?"" ""Nah, I'm just finishing a book about something historical and that coffee may just have me missing my train. Gotta be home before six, you know, or the missus will kill me"". Some book."
4,Very Dark to the Point of Scarrieness.,"OK I give this cd a 4 for musical content. I thought it had some great ingenuity as all of Aaron Funk's cds do. My problem is in that some of the tracks were a little too dark. I was also disturbed by the artwork contained inside. It looked very much like child pornography. It was kind of disgusting and actually I returned it where I bought it for that reason. Some of V.Snares other cds like ""Candice"" have similar imagery but its on the outside for you to see if you're ok with buying something like that. I'm not. LOve his music but not Child Pornography."
3,Freud Onstage,"Though the material stops c 1950 (it's based on the author'sdoctoral thesis at USC), it offers worthy information anddiscussions of Freud as he effected the American theatreand playwrights fr Clyde Fitch to Thornton Wilder and TennWilliams. Also included are such lesser names as Mary Chaseand Saroyan. Didn't the American theatuh sorta STOP in theearly 50s, anyway? (Today Bwy is musical flubdubs)."
5,What took so long!,Awesome! It's about time. Ben Murray and Siobhan Quinn are great together. I love frog stew. My only complaint is that there aren't more original songs.
5,two stories in one,"This book tells two Chinese stories in one volume. The first story explains, why dragons have antlers and roosters do not, and the second story tells of how the Jade Emperor selected twelve animals to represent the twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac.Car and Rat, by Ed Young, is a similar version of how the animals, representing the Chinese zodiac were chosen.Hard cover with dust jacket and excellent print and colorful illustrations on good quality paper."
5,Uba-licous!,"'Magdalena' and 'La Yuca' are super; they take me back to boyhood days in the Republic spent on the beach eating mangoes and playing the local game of ""Cheporro"" with the gang. Easy fun listening."
1,Tru=ibute A Luciano Pavarotti,I ordered this item twice and instead of gettingTribute A Luciano Pavarotti I got SUPER UBA from Amazon.Even the picture shows the wrong CDVery dissapointed now I am stuck with the wrong CD because I opened the case.
5,"Unique, soulful, passionate works for flute & piano","A special collection of music recorded on flute with a layering of flute choir (alto and bass flutes) and piano. Derived from classical Jewish music, some familiar, some new, all easy to listen to. Relaxing; takes the listener on a musical journey. I found myself listening to this CD over and over! Check out the Gershwinesque composition by Kurt Weill--a jazzy, bluesy classical piece worth hearing--the meditative David Amram piece,and the moving Holocaust music. Overall, a satisfying, interesting, and highly polished performance of beautiful music. Five stars!"
3,the truth lies somewhere in the middle,"I'm a big fan of Car Talk and love Ray and Tom's sense of humor. I wanted to love this book. The opening chapters of their biographies and opinions on things like driver's licenses were well done, interesting and funny in parts. In the true rant section, things got a bit unfocused, unfunny and ""out there."" If you want a coherent ""rant"" book, try The O'Reilly factor which is much better done and much funnier and pointed.I'm not trying to be uncharitable -- there are funny parts, but next to geniuses like David Barry or Dennis Miller, this book pales. The most interesting part was about their lives, not their rants. A mediocre book from the still funny guys on Car Talk. I'm still a fan of their show, but not a huge fan of the book. At least it took less than an hour to read!"
1,Save a Tree,"Save a tree and forget this book. I'm a sometimes listener to their radio show and enjoy their sense of humor. I guess this is what happens when you let celebrities write their own books. It does live up to the subtitle of Rant and Rave. It sounds like two guys who have thought out their ideas under the close scrutiny of patrons at the local barber shop. There's even an admission in it that one of them deliberately drives in the left lane at the posted speed just to slow down those folks who go over the speed limit. That's to show them a lesson. I've heard folks say that people like this exisit, but I was never sure. To me their sense of humor just wasn't evident in this book. Wow, guys! Forget your writing and philosophy career and stick with the radio."
1,Rants Without Anything to Back It Up,"On their radio show, Click and Clack frequently rant about car-related subjects....and usually are right on. Their stance against cell phone use in cars is downright admirable. They also have spoken out against overpowered vehicles and the new wave of headlights on luxury cars.However, I guess I should have expected that they weren't very conscientious given that they never say much against the onslaught of huge SUV's. Their stance on global warning in this book is inexcusable. I expect some logic behind rants....they had none. If I want this line of thinking, I'll listen to Rush."
5,REVIEWER HELL,"REVIEWER HELL REVIEWER HELL - I COULD WRITE A BETTER REVIEW THAN YOU - HOMEBOY ! The reason I give this 5 stars - the ""classic"" rating- is because it is a document unlike anything else - like The Shaggs or Wild Man Fischer - stuff that no panel of record executives could ever dream up assembling- and how can you rate such a thing but within the context of such anomalies. A group of elementary school kids screaming out in agony about ""Hot Dog Hell"" - in a manner that makes death metal and gangster rap - in my not-so-humble opinion- look like PUSSIES. Sure it's raw and somewhat repetitive and they don't have a bunch of expensive equipment to make them sound better - but it's elementary age kids - for crissake! what do you expect! I have always enjoyed this recording - it makes me happy - I look forward to getting their other release which I've just become aware of here on Amazon - C.I.A. Drug Fest- for a mere $1.26."
1,"Awful, awful, music.","The premise is hilarious. Take three kids, 10 years old, who can't play instruments. Put them on instruments, let them write some inane 10-year-old lyrics (""James is stupid! I hate James!""), and put them in a recording studio. A week later, voila, an album of screaming and chaos!It's the worst album, musically, that I own. It's pretty funny in its own way, but I don't go out of my way to listen to it. The lyrics are pretty silly, but sometimes hilarious (""I hate this hot dog it tastes like crap!"").Not recommended for any but historians and serious punk fans."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"From Wes Craven comes The People Under The Stairs. A lovely little story about a young man who breaks into his landlords mansion, only to find that he and his wife are crazy. They have a habit of punishing their children, by cutting out the bad parts and holding them prisoner under the basement stairs. It's a very original story, unfortunately the cast is so bad, that the film becomes more of a farce than a horror film. Brandon Adams plays Fool, the lead, and he is just plain bad. The parents on the other hand were completely hilarious, but I'm not sure it was done on purpose. There are a few funny lines thrown in, but I found them to be hilarious throughout the entire movie. Overall I found the story to be very original, but I just didn't see it as scary, it was more a comedy to me. I didn't get what Craven was going for and therefore I can only say the film was ok."
1,Sewing kit,This item is too small for any type of sewing storage and the items that come with it are super cheap
1,Not impressed!,"I have taken this product twice (for two months during that ""time"") and it doesn't help at all with irritability or painful cramps. Would not purchase again!"
2,didn't work for me,"I have been suffering from painful periods for over twenty years, even after my three children were born. I never liked popping heavy mg medicine so i would just grab two of the lightest pain relievers i could and ""stomach"" whatever pain was left. I came across this name on a website called goodguide.com where they review products based on a number of scientific scores and one of the criteria being how healthy is it for you to take. It scored a 10 out of 10 so I thought I'd give it a try....after using for two months the minimum three days each month, i can honestly say it was ineffective. It dampened the pain but produced no drowsiness which is something i look forward to when having pain so i can be lulled to sleep. I am very health conscious and would choose to use a product that has few questionable ingredients bur I would also like an effective product or else i'm just dumping more chemicals in my body for nothing..... eat drink and be weary folks..."
5,A child who never quit,"This book describes the short life of a child who never gave up on the belief that he would some day be able to live like other children, although he knew very well the limitations of his disabilities. It's a heart warming story that later ended in tragedy. The inspiration that his story gives the reader is beyond compair. The book could also have been titled ""Against All Odds"" but the selection of ""Charlie's Touchdown"" is more than appropriate because of his enthusiasm for the sport. It's a book well worth anyone's time and will certainly leave an everlasting impression on any reader."
5,"Faith, Hope, and Love -- A True Story!","""Charlie's Touchdown"" is an awesome testimony of life, love, and the pursuit of happiness (no matter the daily struggles, the never-ending challenges, the pain of human suffering, and the grief of the human heart). Charlie, his family, and their faith will inspire you. And you will find plenty of the Holy Spirit all along the way!A powerful read for anyone; an especially uplifting read for bereaved parents and those grieving the loss of a loved one."
3,Could be great if remastered!!,"The album itself is a beautiful compendium of songs not often found on CD, well orchestrated and the choral direction is absolutely excellent. However, the CD needs to be remastered. Some of the songs are full quality sound and others are muted nearly by half. Listening to this CD is a chore because of the variants in the sound quality.Please remaster this CD so we can listen to this fantastic music. I beg you. Why waste such efforts in recording only to have it put cheaply on the CD. Terrible waste of time and energy....and money for the consumer."
3,Locals Only,I enjoyed the album Locals Only by the Surf Punks. I do feel however that it pales in comparison with their first album but there are some rather nice points of brilliance throughout the album. Recommended if you are a fan. Not recommended if you have never heard the music of the Surf Punks...that is what the first album is for.
4,Funny Classic Surf Punk,"I remember hearing the Surf Punks on KROQ many years ago. From a humor standpoint, they remind me of the Dead Milkmen.I'm not sure I'd recommend buying this if you aren't familiar with the band. Want to see if it's up your alley? Play the ""Shark Attack"" preview."
5,Kool Keith does it again,"Kool Keith really shines on this record. This does not have the mad DJ onslaught that DJ Qbert provided the Dr. Octagon album, but this is near it's equal (but not quite). I give it five stars, though, because the second place Kool Keith record is still better than 98% of the other rap and r&b b.s. coming out these days. The beats here are more spare, but very crafty and even trippy. Kool Keith is in top form, with many classic raps. An earlier comment mentioned that his mastery of cadence really comes out here, and that comment is right on. Don't think, just buy."
5,I'm laffin',"I've been following Kool Keith for years n years...this guy constantley comes of with the crazy.. Some how he always finds guests that can spit like him....to a point.Motion Man clearly demonstrates he is ready to rhyme on this album while Jacky Jasper,though featured more seems to be reaching a little harder..All in all the bass hittin' beats and ridiculous lyrics come off constantly......the kind where you find new craziness each time you listen,..."
4,Hey... what's that smell down there?,"Anyone that doubts Kool Keith's talent (believe it or not, there are still some of them out there) needs to listen to ""No Chorus."" This album is pure wordplay here. Some of the beats are catchy, but the lyrics step into the spotlight and stay there. No Chorus, in my opinion, is the best on the album. Keith just has a way of saying things... fans know what I'm talking about. Apartment 223 is another stand-out, but then again, so is every other track. Not quite better than Octagon (I love Automator, what more can I say), but a great album none the less. Get it!"
5,DR.DOOM THIS JUST GETZ BETTER AND BETTER,DR.DOOM is tha best album yet by KOOL KEITH with bass hittin' hard on every track DR.DOOM spitz graphic murderous type of lyrics and has many different styles to flip on 17 songs(with 4 skits) including tha hidden last track about ball headed girlz mad funny and true. THIS IS A CLASSIC no one else could even think about making an album like this one. I can't wait until THA BLACK ELVIS album and the album that he singed to do on RUFFHOUSE RECORDS. DR. DOOM's IN THA ROOM KUTMASTA KURT better keep producing tha beats. FIVE MICS F THA SOURCE!!!!!!!!!!
2,Mediocre,"I read Ms. Presberg's book right after reading one by Dick Francis and right before reading one by Barbara Paul. Compared with those two writers Ms. Presberg comes across as an amateur. Her publisher compares her book with Richard Powell's Tickets to the Devil. I read that book many years ago, and in my opinion Ms. Presberg's book does not come close. As a bridge player I found her bridge examples particularly dull. I am certainly not an expert on police procedures, but I doubt if any professional police officer would have acted as she portrayed the police in her novel. As a mystery fan, I found a total lack of any suspense. Ms. Presberg did do a good job of hiding the identity of the perpetrator until the end."
3,Good effort but gets bogged down...,"I gave this book every chance to entice me but it gets bogged down in the multiplicity of characters, unrealistic dialogue and plot. It is a good effort though. As a chess player and reader of chess novels I know how difficult it is to create a novel in the game genre. The author knows her bridge and computer science but unfortunately the detective writing lacked a spark and other elements that would have made it interesting. The dialogue often seemed contrived and the action also seemed unrealistic and dragged on and on. The suspense was in determining who cheated and who was the murderer. These answers came at the end but maybe too late to keep the reader's attention."
1,"No stars, do not waste your money on this cheap printer.",I was very happy to use this All-in-one for a couple of months and then next thing I know the printer would not feed the paper correctly. I tried everything to no avail. This thing is not even worth the shipping and handling if you got it for free.
2,USED Lexmark Printer,I could not get this printer to work. An email to the seller was not returned. The lesson learned - never buy a used printer.
4,THE SEVENTH FLOOR,It's always good to see beautiful Brooke Shields in action and in an excellent thriller too.The DVD has a bare bones menu of the type I have seen with soft core films
3,edgar sanchez needs to be silent,"Edgar thinks everything sucks. He needs to shut his trap and keep his opinion to himself because he's garbage. He's a classic hater and I bet he isn't even from LA. Yo Edgar I never heard of ya so get off Fat Joe, because you don't even exist to him or us real hip hoppets. Edgar go back into your hole and stay there. You fcking hater."
2,Why Joe? Why?,"Fat Joe seems to have gone the route of Ja Rule with this LP. His sophomore LP, ""Don Cartagena"" was a slept-on record and perhaps because of that, he mixed a little R&B sound into his next album, ""Jealous Ones Still Envy"". After that album became a platinum hit, he dropped this weak follow-up. Aside from the second single, ""All I Need"" with the laid-back hook from Tony Sunshine, this album really wasn't much. ""Bust At You"" was about the 550th song to sample Bootsy Collins' ""I'd Rather Be With You"" and so many others have done it much better. Not even Scarface could save it. Well, R&B crossover seems to be all the rave these days so all of you TRL fans... Enjoy."
4,Joey Crack is back!!,Fat Joe is back...fresh off of J.O.S.E. after FINALLY going platinum. This album is tight...not quite as well put together as J.O.S.E. but still tight as ish...Standout tracks are Bust At You featuring Baby and Scarface and Prove Something. Plenty of sensitive tracks for tha ladies too.
2,Ok I guess,"Ok cd. Has to many annoying party joints on it, and 'Crush Tonight' is becoming annoying. Better off getting the new Nas cd."
4,Much Better,"Still not as good as Don Caragena but a whole lot better than J.O.S.E the track ""Life Goes On"" is hot and of course ""All I Need"" this album is worth buying only because of Tony Sunshine he made this album. How about letting him drop an album sometime this decade Joe"
2,Jealous Ones No Envy,"As a happy owner of ""Jealous Ones Still Envy (J.O.S.E.)"", I was actually disappointed with Fat Joe's follow up CD ""Loyalty"". He should have made this a remix CD due to the fact the production, lyrics, and storyline if extremely similar to the ""J.O.S.E."" and previous Terror Squad and Roc-A-Fella projects. This is what happens when you get a fat head and do a rush job. The only 4 tracks I liked was:1. Life goes on2. Prove Something3. Born In The Ghetto4. All I NeedI am not hatin' I like Fat Joe besides, sometimes people like a good remix."
1,Not for serious bilingual babies,"We are raising our son trilingual according to the most recent developments in this areas. If you are to raise them bilingual as mother speakers then there has to be clear definations between each of the languages. In other words, do not mix the languages. I thought that this cd would have songs in Spanish and then the same song in English. However, verses and words are mixed all the time. Being trilingual myself, I found this to be very confusing and against the rules of raising multilingual children."
1,It hurt my ears,"I have just listened to the samples available online, and being a native spanish speaker, the gramatical errors I have heard hurt my ears. I am also bringing up my baby bilingual english/spanish, and as someone mentioned in a previous review, mixing the two lenguages goes against the expert's advice, as it creates confusion for the baby."
5,Keep this one in your car!,"My son is 4yrs old and goes to Spanish class once a week. He really enjoys this music and so does my 2yr old who is just learning to speak english. Never too young to start the awareness of another language. We play it on the way to school. It sings one verse in English and then in Spanish, unlike some cd's that seem to be for kids who only speak Spanish. Great starter music."
5,Uni Verse of Song: Spanish,"My two year old daughter and I really enjoy this CD. The songs have a fun beat and are sung in Spanish and English. Also, Spanish words are reviewed in English and Spanish throughout the CD. We listen to it in the car and she moves her head back and forth to the rhythm and sings while in her car seat. The words are very easy to understand. I would definitely recommend this CD for all ages wanting to learn Spanish."
5,Wicked Man,"Everton Blender, has a true vision. The deep look in his eyes, tells you that he is seeing what he is saying. This hit reveals the true character of reggae artists. Reggae artists have the ability to create music that is internationally appealing.Forward Fadda Blender!"
5,"Taut,well-executed,and realistic","The plot of this film concerns a professor, superbly played by Jeff Bridges, who discovers that his neighbors,superbly played by Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins,are terrorists. He learns of their plans and tries to foil them. The twist ending will stay for you with days."
3,Very Good but Underrated Thriller,"This movie is one of the sleepers of 1999. It had a very short run at the box office before being released to video, which after watching the movie I found really surprising.Arlington Road is a well-done thriller about domestic terrorism and paranoia that seems very appropo for our times (forget the anti-Clinton rantings of the idiot, er, reviewer below who appears more interested in promoting some paranoid right wing agenda than in honestly and objectively reviewing a movie). The ending is quite surprising and alone justifies watching this movie. Robbins and Bridges both turn in very good performances, as does Joan Cusack as the wife of a terrorist bomber. The only thing that kept me from giving this movie a higher review is that the plot seems rather implausible."
4,an excellent movie !,"This is certainly not your stereotype, run-of-the-mill action film. Rather, it makes you think about issues involved and tends to leave you a little paranoid. The ending was really good, avoiding the cliche of ""hero saves the day, helped by all-powerful FBI/police."" Instead you get an ending which, without revealing it, I will say is deeply disturbing. It left me severely rattled for a long time after watching it. Not a scary ending, just a chilling one.The only real problem I had with this film was Tim Robbins. He is just not an actor I believed as a villain. He didn't exude evil the way some movie bad guys do; and this was too much of a stretch from his previous work. More believeable was Joan Cusack as Robbins' wife, because the person her character is presenting to the world is more in line with what you expect from her."
3,alot to think about,this movie presents alot of interesting ideas. about how the fbi may make mistakes of judgement and why it is benifical for a goverment to quickly wrap up a bombing and to blame one man. for me this is the big appeal of the film. the acting is pretty good overall. jeff bridges jumps from one extreme to another but time robbins and joan cussak are very good. the ending is what everyone is talking about. all i can say on that is to watch it yourself. everyone veiws it differently and it is important to see it it for yourself.
2,Good Premise Undermined by Improbable Conclusion,"The film starts out quite nicely as a sort of Twilight-Zoneish paranoid thriller (remember the episode where all of the neighbors accuse each other of being aliens? Well, this time it's terrorists)buoyed by terrific performances all around, but loses it entirely at the climax. The ultimate resolution doesn't make much sense and carries with it all of the incoherent ingredients of a fever dream. I tried to figure out the logistics of the villain's plan, and it was just too risky. Too many things could go wrong with what they were planning. To reveal these errors could be regarded as spoilers, so I am trying to keep it vague, but many other customers at the video store tend to agree with me. Maybe the alternate ending on the DVD makes more sense."
4,WOW,"This movie was absolutely amazing- (I just saw it on TV though, so i didn't get to buy it- or watch all the apparently interesting extras on the DVD!)I live in Reston, VA where the story takes place- and know of a ""Michael Farady Rd."" right near where I live (named after an inventor- not the movie..) but this made the movie all the more interesting! And then to think this was a pre-sept 11 movie! What an interesting thought- that your next door neighbor could be a terrorist? Espeically considering that I also have friends who knew the Russian Spy you may recall.This moive was AMAZING!!! SOO realistic- makes you think, and makes you angry. Wish I had the DVD so I could watch it again."
5,One of the best movies of the decade!,"Do not be deceived by the poor box office gross of this film. Nor be persuaded by the critics lambasting of ARLINGTON ROAD. Starring Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins (two of Hollywood's most underrated actors), this psychological thriller will blow you away (no pun intended). While the first half may seem slow, it's all building up to an edge-of-your-seat conclusion that will make your jaw drop. ARLINGTON ROAD may seem like it was all given away in the trailers. Listen well, reader: it was not. After seeing it three times, I feel I find new intracacies each time. ARLINGTON ROAD is a tale of modern-day paranoia, and it will leave you questioning yourself about what to believe and not to."
4,"Great twist, shame about the atmosphere.","'Arlington Road' has one of the best and most unexpectedly brilliant twist endings of any thriller, but the movie's premise is dependent on setting up a REALISTIC atmosphere of suburban life. Sadly and crucially the suburban Washington D.C. in the movie looks and feels like its on a different planet."
2,We're all screwed?,"Average movie at best but that's not what's really wrong with this movie. What's wrong is the whole premise that terrorism thrives because our government is so inept and screwed up. Bridge's character is screwed up because the government screwed up his life and the same goes with Robbins' character, although they're supposedly on opposite ends of the spectrum on what is right or wrong. Terrorism succeeeds in this movie because everyone associated with government and media, including FBI, is inept and screwed up. So, what is the message we're suppose to take away from this movie - that the terrorism will succeed and should be allowed to succeed because our government is so screwed up? If you buy into such pathetic cynicism, you'll fully enjoy this movie."
4,Not far from fact,"This is one intense movie that has one or two slow spots but for the most part, keeps you entertained. The premise of the movie isn't that far off from what might really be happening in this country. The cast did a great job in their roles but I must say I would have preferred a different ending than the one we got."
3,Prescient Musings on Terrorism in America are Hampered by a Plodding Plot,"Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges address homegrown terrorism and the fiber of manipulation as a pair of wary, suspicious suburban neighbors. Robbins is terrific as the shady new guy who keeps his emotions close to the vest, pairing a wicked, piercing gaze with an ambiguous, noncommittal temperament. Bridges, the viewer's perspective and proposed voice of reason, is much less fascinating; a vanilla conspiracy theorist with a short fuse, it's tough to find sympathy for his obsessive investigations of the new acquaintance, even when they start bearing some fruit. The film's musings on terrorism in a pre-9/11 America are interesting food for thought, particularly in that they seem to be challenging many of the knee-jerk reactions that eventually would take place. Ultimately, a bold, memorable finale somewhat redeems the plot, which is quite predictable up to that point."
1,Awful!,This movie was horrendous. What a terrible ending. If I had seen this movie in the theater I would have walked out MAD!
3,THOSE RIGHT WING WACKOS,"After Tim McVeigh blew up the Oklahoma Federal Building, the Left went berserk, although their own Ted Kazcysnski (the Unabomber) beat them back. What has emerged in the years since is that if a real bad guy looks like McVeigh, he does the ""perp walk"" and is displayed for the cameras. If he is black, a black Muslim, or some such thing, he gets the hidden suspect treatment. ""Arlington Road"" is Robbins as a right-wing wacko who plans to blow up the government. The message is that the right in this country is dominated by white racists who think nothing of killing many, because they are Fascists. It is heavy-handed and compared with Truth fails miserably.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF ""BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN""STWRITES@AOL.COM"
1,"Un-realistic and obtuse, the ending was dumb, too long.","Action junkies united for another over blown audio & video attack on our all too willingness for suspence of dis-belief. It makes the FBI look incompatent. They are not as ambivalent as the film would have us believe. Jeff Bridges creates great action, but could not convince the viewer this would really happen. The message is crepuscular and over-stated."
2,"Formulaic, and plot holes you can throw a cat through.","The most enjoyable thing about ""Arlington Road"" is keeping a running count of (A) the directorial cliches it employs, and (B) the numerous plot holes that not only strain credulity, but rip it into tiny pieces and flush it right down the toilet. Let's just say both are in the double digits, most coming in the last 20 minutes of the film.The basic idea here is great: the mild-mannered terrorist next door. But getting from there to the film's preposterous ending in one believable piece is something these writers were simply not capable of, even if the actors were."
3,The Terrorist Next Door,"Arlington RoadThe story of a man who seems paranoid that his neighbor is a domestic terrorist. He turns out to be right. Stars Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins. Worth seeing.I recommend my novel Devil's Verse.Devil's Verse: Natasha Azshatan Unlocks Ancient Mysteries, Reveals Secrets, And Wrestles With Demons As She Fights To Stay Alive"
1,Awful!,"I can't tell you why without revealing a crucial plot twist; however, I can say that everything leading up to the climax suddenly depends on things just happening to work out right. The success of a very intricate plan suddenly becomes dependent on numerous chances that the writer & director must have thought made the plot event more clever. Wrong."
3,a extended episode of the twilight zone,"thats what it seems like to me. i just like the fact that a big budget hollywood film with underworked overpaid actors has a very downer ending. in fact, if jeff bridges saved the day this movie would just plain suck. really, think about it. its a ok film, can't say its my fav. for a hollywood film it has balls."
1,"Horrible, dead","NO STARS for a EVIL FILM. Not the most original concept.One star for Jeff Bridges. The rest of the film gets a THUMBS DOWN. This is a great example of how media enlightens people to be bad.The only positive note is for Tim Robbins who gets to stick it to the United States government. ha ha ha ha.Overall, THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW MOVIES I REGRET HAVING EVER SEEN."
4,Keeping up with the Joneses,"Every once in a while there's a flick that'll defy the ""laws"" of Hollywood, and this is one of them. I won't make the reference as to what, you'll just have to see for yourself. This frighteningly real movie is enough to make the talkers in the theater shut up and listen for a change. Tim Robbins character, with those deceivingly innocent-boyish looks and grins is simply a modern-day monster planning a hell of a devilish scheme. From the moment this film begins, with the youngster in the middle of a nice neighborhood road, you'll wonder if Jeff Bridges is simply dreaming. One wishes it was all dream. Excellent twists, damn good writing, and very well directed. Intense, crafty, and supenseful, you'll never look at your newly moved-in next door neighbors the same way again."
5,BOOM!,"Smart, witty, one of the best thrillers of the decade! Oscar-contending performance by Bridges. A recommended must see"
4,You thought this was the stuff of fantasy?,"Tim Robbins and JeffBridges are fabulous in this movie of 'sleeper cells,' that prior to 2000 would have seemed nothing more than a fantastical story - but now we know different . Joan Cusack as Tim Robbins wife is equally scary and plays her part to perfection. My partner and I were playing the 'yes they are / no their not,' game as we watched it, not really being sure of the intent of anyone until the mind blowing conclusion. (Pun intended.)"
2,"Weak story, poorly executed",This blah movie just drags on and on with no promise of a climax. No suspense. No surprise. No originality.
4,"Creepy, fun and engaging thriller","I generally don't like thriller or mystery movies. Too much blood and guns and not enough story. But this one was quite good. Tim Robbins is unusually good in his bad-guy roll (better than in Antitrust, but similar roles). Jeff Bridges is great as the main character. It will keep you on your toes and guessing as to how it all goes down. It kind of makes you wonder about the Oklahoma City bombing and how many people were really involved in it. Good recommend for people who don't mind scary/tense movies."
4,Believable and Awesome,"The acting in this film was first rate, natural and believable. As a college professor myself, I bought the character played by Jeff Bridges, whereas in most other movies the actors who portray intellectuals come across just pathetic. I bought Tim Robbins' character, too. The ending of this film is the major element that sets it apart from the happy-go-lucky standard Hollywood servings. I did not buy the FBI character, the partner of Bridges' slain wife, he comes across as a stereotype. I recommend this movie."
5,Hella Cool,This was one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. I recommend it to anyone. It's one of those movies you tend to ignore because the title sounds boring. But trust me it's not.
2,brilliant ending???!!?,"well, i found Arlington Road a good suspense film,but i have to say that the ending was way too disturbing for me.It was so unfair what happenned to Michael Faraday(Jeff Bridges).It was like a punch on my stomach...It wasn't necessary a happy ending there are lots of films whose endings are not happy but they're great. Now this ending really made me upset..."
2,Uneven Sometimes Laughable Thriller,"Somehow this film just doesn't work. Jeff Bridges goes over the top and becomes irritating. The plot is laughably ridiculous. But on the other hand, the film has a cool blockbuster ending that it deserves kudos for alone. I liked the film's premise, it just doesn't come off. I think Bridges and Robbins were sorely miscast."
4,Arlington Road,This was one of the few movies that has ever scared me! It brings you face to face with the true monsters of the world!
3,Inferior remake marred by Bridges' acting.,"This film is an inferior remake of The Parallax View. Jeff Bridges overacts and is not believable. The production values are fine, but anyone who believes that the ending, which is surely upsetting, is shocking, has not seen enough political thrillers. Finally, the argument that this film is Oscar-worthy is simply not tenable in light of the degree to which it borrows from The Parallax View and its failure to improve upon The Parallax View in any significant respect."
2,this has been done before,"after viewing this mildly exciting movie it dawned on me that this had been done before and much better without the fireworks. One only has to remember Warren Beatty""s wonderful trip into true political paranoia in ""The Parallax View"" to wax nostalgic how this movie is a poor ripoff of the older classic. To bad they wasted Jeff Bridges on this inferior remake."
4,CLOSE TO PERFECTION,"ARLINGTON ROAD is fantastic. Fast paced, great acting, good direction, unexpected ending (without being silly), a moral plot, good premise. Bridges and Robbins are both outstanding here. I felt suffocated watching the plot develop to a no winner situation. Amazing."
5,Everyone except you,"I absolutely loved this movie.Tim Robbins was really, really, better than good. With Jeff Bridges, who is a terrorism teacher whose wife was killed, while working as an agent for the FBI. Brillant!! Five stars isn't enough"
3,"Good solid story, lots of tension","This story is really engaging and the plot is good. It is often hard to get this type of movie to play well on screen, often the personal interactions between characters only come across well in book form, but I think the tension between Bridges and Robbins in this movie come across as feeling real.While not a really ""scary"" movie there are some scenes that do play very tense and make the movie a good thriller even though it is far from an action flick.The story is one that makes you think and that fact overcomes the underlining problem of being a bit slow at times. All in all it is a good movie and well worth watching. Because of the twists which are only really fun to watch once and the lack of fast paced action it may fall in the rental category but it is definitely worth watching."
3,Definitely worth seeing,"Perhaps it really was marketing that kept this film from being a success, and that's a shame. Jeff Bridges, a very underrated actor, is very good in this film about paranoia and conspiracies. Joan Cusack is also memorable. Overall, a great premise, solid execution, and remarkable conclusion."
3,"Not bad, but...","The film is decent, the ending a bit of a shocker (I had no idea it was coming, rather like ""the Sixth Sense""); my only problem is that everyone realizes from the start of the film who the bad guys and good guys are. Why waste so much time trying to convince us it's all Jeff Bridge's imagination?"
3,"Harsh ride, start to Finish","This movie collapses on itself and alternates from cerebral thriller to 70's style action rehash. definitely worth watching, it is much better than your average action movie."
4,A great movie even if it is a little improbable,My wife & I got this move on the advise of a friend who said it had a great twist at the end. If you love conspiracy theories this one will bowl you over - just be prepared to accept lots of implausabilities. (We also had problems with the special features working on our DVD player)
4,Powerful!,"Although the opening credits were so jarring that I was getting a headache, the movie itself was fast-paced and very well-acted. The level of tension ratcheted up continually and I don't remember ""coming up for air"" until the end. The ending was totally unexpected, but that's the sign of a good movie. Bridges, Robbins and Cusack did a terrific job. Given the subject matter, watching the movie fourteen years after it was filmed gave an interesting perspective."
5,one of my top 3 favorite movies of 1999,"This movie is not your typical hollywood action movie. It is an entertaining movie that also tries to make you think about how we as a society deal with terrorism, media, and violence. The DVD has commentary by Jeff Bridges and the director, which I found to be very interesting. It gave a fascinating glimpse into how the movie was made, problems with shooting the movie, and funny tales from the set."
4,Quite a trip,"This is a fun thriller with a devastating makes-you-think twist that is rises above your formulaic action pic.Bridges is always very good, different for Robbins, and Joan Cusack stole the best of the ""Stepford Wives"" for her part.Exciting, tense, a frightening shocker of an ending and characters who are all very flawed and not always likable. A realistic approach that helped to make it a little less of the clean-cut good vs. bad deal.Give it a shot."
5,Arlington Road: A Personal Inspiration,"I am an amateur writer and I found this movie to be inspiring to a novel I am authoring. Last summer, I walked into the theater thinking this would be just some stupid action movie. But it turned out to be more; and when I left I felt it was one of the best movies I had ever seen and the group I was with was terrified. If you want a realistic look into today's society, without it being a stupid action movie with special effects, then rent this movie. Believe me you will think about it for days."
2,Expected much more!,"The film starts out well enough, seems interesting, and then it just gets frustrating to see forced plot movements. The way it was shot was very lame at times, awkward angle shots, weird lighting, trying to be artistic and failing miserably. Like in the last scene when the FBI is all up in that basement garage of the building, and the main character runs back to the car, WHERE DID ALL THE COPS GO? I don't know, there was so much more potential in this story, but it became belaboring to finish the movie."
5,awesome,It was an easy transaction and a quick shipment. It truly was excellent great wholesome wonderful stupendous service all around!
3,Intense But Disappointing Movie,"This movie keeps the tension fairly high throughout, but the final half-hour gets unrealistically wacky. Although the very surprising ending is dramatic and then.. well, you may find it terriboy unsatisfying. But, I think the whole movie was overdone. I think the actors acted like they were on steroids, especially Jeff Bridges. At the end, you see why they had him acting so hyper, but still, it wasn't realistic. Also, there was more than a whiff of political B.S. -- as you might expect from any movie Tim Robbins is in -- particularly when it comes to painting the FBI as bad guys and the fanatics as right-wingers. This is one of those movies you'll forget about ten minutes after it ends."
4,Arlington Road,"This was a great movie, it arrived in plenty of time, and was in great shape, I would recommend this sell to others."
4,Why No Letterbox?,This is an excellent paranoid thriller; well-constructed and well-acted. I recommend you find it on DVD since this Amazon version IS NOT LETTERBOXED! There is no excuse for this.
2,Immediately forgettable,"One method for judging movies is to consider whether some aspect stays with you, a character, a plot event, a mood, a place. All of the great movies have ""staying power"" that way. You keep thinking about them in the days after. Then there are the movies at the other end of the spectrum--you can hardly remember what happened by the next day, and you care even less. Although I'm a Robbins fan, this video is such a forgettable movie. The advantage, of course, is that you can also forget the things that made no sense at all (and there were many) and you can keep watching it -- every night, I suppose, since it will not stick."
3,Arlington Road,"From the disturbing opening scene of the film to the sad, yet interesting ending, this movie basically points out that curiosity really does kill the cat. Robbins was excellent but Bridges character seemed too compelled with his next door neighbor, he suddenly become a stalker tracing Robbins every move. But even the during the last minutes of the movie, its twist in the plot only comes at the very end leaving you bewildered. Interesting score by Badalamenti for the soundtrack."
4,Nerve-Racking and Very Well Made,"An odd occurrence of events that leads the viewer from one thing to another. It truly was a thriller that could have been based on notes from a psychology professor, which made it so enjoyable, but at the same time stressful as the plot unfolds. It is a movie to be remembered"
2,Predictable and contrite,"Though Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins put in some good performances, this film is simply too formulaic and predictable. My 2 stars of course also reflect my own preferences of ending in a movie."
3,"Okay, but not the greatest","WOW, this movie is really good! It was one of the best I've seen! It was very well made and the effects were fabulous. I was really into it, when it just ended. It left you hanging and the bad guy won the battle. I have to say, I would have rated this with 5 stars and account it for one of my favorite movies, but the ending was horrible. I don't think it deserves to be a movie!"
5,A Delectable Heart Healthy Cookbook,"This book contains many delicious recipes that are simple to make. Moreover, there is a wonderful selection of appetizers, soups, salads, entrees, vegetable dishes, breads and desserts. A bountiful array of fruits and vegetables are featured in each recipe category. As a clinical nutritionist, I have high regard for a cookbook that presents easy to prepare, heart healthy recipes that use many different foods thereby allowing people to enjoy a wide variety of foods in their diet. I encourage readers to explore a most impressive compilation of healthy and tasty recipes. This cookbook will effectively promote adherence to contemporary dietary recommendations and, thus, help lower the incidence of coronary disease. A wonderful virtue of the many recipes is enjoyable eating and, at the same time, heart health!"
4,Healthy food doesn't have to taste like dirt,"Like many people these days, I'm trying to improve my diet... but I love good food! I've wasted my money on several ""healthy"" cookbooks only to find the recipes were simply terrible.This book is the exception. Simply put, the recipes are easy to prepare, original, and very tasty. You'd never guess you were eating ""healthy."" We've tried about a dozen recipes so far, and every one has been a success.The book also includes cooking tips and advice that are helpful for any type of cooking, and good advice on healthy shopping.If you want to improve your diet without sacrificing the joy of preapring and eating good food, buy this book."
3,"Good book, but needs an addition","I have the 6th edition and thought I would check out this 7th edition before I purchased it and what I find is that the AHA does not work with, evidently, the American Diabetic Association in guidelines.I have had bypass surgery and am supposed to have a low cholesterol - low fat diet. My dad, for whom I am caregiver, has had a mild heart attack and his cardiologist has told him the same thing and to include the low sodium to his diet.Well, when the dietician came to talk to us, all she had was food exchanges and did not know how to convert the recipes in the book I have to food exchanges. I sure don't know, so, I don't know how to use this book to help me with meal plans.Anyone got any ideas? ADA doesn't seem to concern themselves with how many grams of fat, mg of sodium, or gm of cholesterol are in a dish.I wish someone would create a book that does have both of these things in them. Then, it would be helpful for both groups!"
5,A must have cookbook for every kitchen,"Like many other people I picked up this book because my doctor told me that I needed to lower my cholesterol and I needed help figuring out how to do that. This book has recipes that are very easy to make, but every dinner I've prepared has tasted good. I mean really good - the food has flavor and the meat is tender & juicy. I was so tired of trying other diet recipes that tasted bland so I'm astonished at all the variety in this cookbook.Also the recipes really spell out ""how"" to cook to for those who might be more unfamiliar with cooking in a kitchen. It gives sensible advise that makes it easy to get started cooking meals at home. With all the variety on sides, beef, pork, seafood, poultry, and desserts it is sure to help anyone start healthy eating & cooking habits. Also the index sections help you understand how to make healthy choices which is great because sometimes you need guidence when going out to eat or buying prepared food."
1,pages missing,This seems like a very good cookbook but there were 44 pages missing. What a ripoff! No more used books for me!
4,Good Book,"I bought this cook book to try and get started on a healthy eating track, but no picutes make it hard to get motivated.The dishes themselves are easy to make. Some dishes I have had to add some extra seasonings, because they were too bland.Some recipes were regular recipes just with substitutions ie instead of eggs use apple sauce etc.Other than that it is a good cook book, but you have to be willing to read through it to get an idea if it is a dish you would like to prepare."
5,Great Heart-Healthy and Delicious Recipes!,"Wonderful cookbook for anyone who is trying to watch their fat, salt and cholesterol intake. Especially liked the crispy baked chicken, only thing I would change would to get breasts that aren't as thick, to maintain cooking time in the recipe. Otherwise, great advice on living healthy, and maintaining a long, heart-healthy life. Recipes are low-fat and absolutely delectible, a combination I haven't seen in quite awhile, and I'm a seasoned cook."
3,"Ok recipes, too much processed foods","There are several great recipes in this book. I bought this, and the AHA Meals in Minutes cookbook, at the same time. The disappointing aspect of the book is that many of the recipes rely on already prepard/processed foods (i.e. canned cream soup, etc...) True, the recipes call for the 'lower-sodium' version of the soups, but, to try and be healthy, eating all the chemical crud that's in these soups seems like a dumb idea. So, while there are many recipes that I'll make (modifying the recipes to use non-prepared/processed foods), I probably won't buy any more of the AHA cookbooks."
5,"The American Heart Association Cookbook, 7th Edition","My husband recently went into heart failure which meant changes to what and how we eat.I bought this book and the first thing I noticed is that the hospital paperwork stated specific information contained in the book, amost word-for-word.I have used the recipes in this book exclusively to feed 5 people, and we are rating the meals on a 1 to 5 scale. we are all particular about what we eat and cannot abide meals lacking in flavor or boring food, and we really loved salt. no more. the average rating for the recipes is a 4.5.I cannot recommend this book more highly. It would be worth a much larger price tag, nut I appreciated the affordability.Well done!"
3,just okay,"We purchased this cookbook based on other reviews and the recipes we've tried have all been tasty, but if the book is available in another format (larger, with pictures, different binding, etc.) it would be significantly easier to use."
1,One star because that is the lowest I can do,"In this book, the only thing the ""Seer""'s author was seeing was those open billfolds and pocket books paying for something they have no idea of what it was they were about to purchase.Clarivoant or the green back dollar? Don't waste your time.There is a large section of Bibles that can fortell the future in all that we need to know and it 100% correct."
1,not good,"I just had someone put it in and it did NOT WORK. I could tell that it was used and I payed for a new one. It would cost me another $11 to send it back, it's not worth it for a $15 player."
2,Disappointed,"I have only watched Scarlet Diva so far, but it was a disappointment. It was much too disturbing for my taste (and I happen to like dark movies)."
5,THERE IS GOOD IN THIS WORLD,THIS MOVIE DOCUMENTS WHAT PUBLIC EDUCATION CAN DO WHEN TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS WORK COLLEGIALLY AND ALLOW THE PROFESSIONALS TO DO THEIR WORK UNFETTERED BY POLITICS OR INFLUENCE. A SMALL TOWN SCHOOL STARTS A PROJECT ON TOLERANCE AND DIVERSITY.THEY USE PAPER CLIPS TO SYMBOLIZE THE LOSS OF 6 MILLION DURING THE HOLOCAUST.THIS TASK EVENTUALLY INVOLVES ALL THE TOWN'S PEOPLE. THIS FILM SHOWS THAT THE GOOD INCLINATION OF HUMANITY PREVAILS AND PORTRAYS THE BEST IN PUBLIC EDUCATION.
5,Interesting and Enlightening,"This documentary is fascinating not only because of the paper clip project, but because of the changes that occur in the people who worked on the project."
5,Worth the time to watch,"I bought this documentary because Whitwell, TN is close to Dalton, GA. Some of my students had visted the museum on a field trip and I wanted to know more. I had no idea what an impact this film would make. It was very inspiring! I could not stop watching it and I had tears streaming down my face. It was well-made and totally appropriate for any audience."
3,a great story but...,"I thought this was a very moving documentary with a great story to tell. Some of the interviews do sound very forced,(we southerners are insecure about how our accent will pick up on camera), but overall it was fine.The only thing I really disliked about this film was the way they edited in the students' comments over top of the Holocaust survivors' speeches. Let the survivors speak! I would much rather hear the stories in the words of the people who lived them than hear a 13 year old girl summarize them. I really think the film makers missed a great opportunity there."
5,"Paper clip, paper clip",This is a good subliment to a study on the Holocaust. It shows how anyone can be interested in history. It was well done. Good for all ages.
5,an especially moving piece of filmaking,"As a Jew who has never experienced any violent anti-semitism in my life, I was extremely moved by this particular film because a group of young men and women whose exposure to Jewish culture or history was at best minimal before tackling such a momentous project. Having studied the Holocaust from a purely academic point of view, I could never completely understand or feel the pain, suffering and anguish my people experienced in their lifetimes during this evil period of history. I think these young men and women, however, actually did; and that would include the adults who supervised this project as well.It is good to know that in world which seems to be moving far too fast that there are people who take the time to understand their neighbors because in this global village of ours that is what we should be to one another.....neighbors!"
4,Paper Clips,"I would definitely recommend this movie because anyone that watches it will simply be in awe when it is over. The symbolic act of collecting paperclips to represent each person that died in the Holocaust is shocking. Paper Clips inspired me to not judge people on the outside, but see them for what is found inside. This movie serves as a reminder of just how awful and nasty people can be, and in some ways, this realization can make you a better person and hopefully a better role model for young people. This movie is absolutely amazing, inspirational, and is great film for people of any age. I especially recommend Paper Clips for middle school age people because you can see how much young people are capable of doing."
5,Powerful and stunning,"This is simply one of the most moving films I have ever seen. I have viewed it a dozen times or so, but it still retains the same impact as my first viewing. A fabulous and gripping work. Bravo!"
5,Great movie and inspiration,I enjoyed this movie and wrote an visual analytical paper. I it so inspiring to see young people do great things through knowledge. This movie shows how a small community was brought together and still continues their efforts to make an awareness of the Holocaust.
4,The Power of an Idea,"My daughter came home charged from watching PAPER CLIPS at her school. She begged for her own copy, so our family settled in to humor her by watching it. Oh, my! What inspiration! We were moved at the sensitivity of the producers in creating a documentary that could have been sappy and sentimental but that is, instead, powerful and moving in its simplicity. As a mom, I'm thrilled to have this documentary in our home collection. As a teacher, I'm excited beyond words to return to my classroom to move our students toward tolerance within our school community and beyond and to demonstrate the power of an idea!"
5,Heartwarming,"Paper Clips is a heartwarming documentary about a small rural homogeneous Tennessee community in which the eighth grade classes for five years carried on a holocaust project. They learned that during World War II, Norwegians wore paper clips to show their opposition to Nazism and anti-Semitism; so the young people collected paper clips to represent the lives lost. Stories were also collected and, most movingly, survivors were interviewed. A memorial was created and the entire community was changed."
3,THE REALEST DOWN SOUF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT I THINK HOUSTON AND DALLAS ARE GOING TO BE THE NEXT CITIES TO BLOW UP BIG IN THE US. IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING BUT THEY SAY GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT. TO ME THIS IS A DOWN SOUTH CLASSIC EVERY SONG IS A BANGER. MY FAVORITE SONG IS NUMBER 8. I AM A HARD REVIEWER SO I ONLY GAVE IT 3 STARS.
3,"Good book, but flaw in potty training theory","The whole concept of the book is good, but no matter how well you stick to the plan a child will only potty train when they are ready, no matter how soon you start. There is a big difference between the child having the parent trained to put them on the potty at the right time, and the child actually being able to go to the potty on their own. I have had this book for months, and my daughter isn't any more potty trained now than she was before I read the book and followed it's advice...."
1,"An ""OK"" book, but I don't buy the premise completely....","I have been struggling trying to find a book to help this ""uneducated"" mommy potty train her two year old. This is the only book that I could find that deals with the subject as a whole (vs. a chapter in a book). I tried to read the entire book, but quickly skipped to the chapter that dealt with two-year olds. That chapter was informative (considering that I know nothing), but I disagree with the author's stance that all kids should begin the process when they are 12 months old. Come on!! The author based this on her own experiences, with little thought that all children are different and ready to start this process at different points. I was very disappointed because I have been criticized more times (by women my mother's generation) for not completing potty training by the time my child was 14 months old. After reading this book, I felt that I had been criticized again."
4,A quick & handy guide on what teens want from their parents,Teens want and need their parents in their life even though they may not act like they do. What I liked about this book is that the author encourages you to talk and listen to your teenager about what is going on in his/her life. The book is easy to read and understand. Some of the chapters that I enjoyed reading are: Keep Talking to Them; Be An Example; Listen to Them; Help Them Build on Solid Foundations; Give Them Quality and Quantitiy Time; Help Them Find Their Special Talent; and Learn More About Them and Their Friends.
5,The most important book for understanding Gurdjieff,"The place of the Gurdjieff teaching and thinking in our modern world is here elucidated.Without any kind of dogmatism,it is an open look on one of the outstanding figures of the 20th century.The extraordinary contributions of Gurdjieff to many fields of knowledge are stimulating for further research."
5,"Meticulous, scholarly, indespensible","This books contains exhaustive research on the medical and societal history of transsexualism, all the theories of its possible causes, everything. Having recently decided to face my own gender issues, I found this book immensely informative and felt a million times less alone. The scientific parts can be a tiny bit dry at times, but the information is priceless and the interviews and firsthand stories are wonderful.Told from the point of view of someone who doesn't have gender identity disorder, the book explains all the aspects of it, even for someone who doesn't know the issue firsthand--this makes it a really excellent resource for people confused by the actions of their transgendered loved ones. I bought copies for both my parents."
5,Greatest sci-fi movie ever..,"I'm not a big fan of sci-fi movies besides Star Wars, but I managed to catch this one on TV one night. This is one the best movies ever! You don't watch this one for the special effects, you watch this one for the totally errieness when they're doing research on the sample. An excellent movie with errie sound effects and even some decent suspense for a movie like this. A must see!"
5,Extremely Educational,What was extra unique about this movie was that its pacing slowed down to show you the scientific process employed by a team of scientist trying to contain a pandemic. This movie slows down to show their whole investigative process and the machines that they use. Any student of organic or biochemistry should be more than well entertained at the way that this movie is presented. It can be categorized as a hard science movie.
4,The Andromeda Strain,"I collect the ""older classics"" and this is one of them. When this filmwas first released, it was a little scarry. Biological warfare is one ofthose we keep in the back of our minds, but try to ignore. The productionby todays standards was ""low budget"" however the story overshadowed the set decor and wardrobe.Michael"
2,Andromeda Strain,"Sometimes when someone wants to update an older movie they try to add things. What was added here was hokey. The original book and movie made it seem like something like this could actually happen but this version introduced black holes and time travel and instead turned into a television version of a B movie. What made the original movie a classic was the writing. When updating don't get carried away, keep it simple stupid! If I had know the new version would have turned out like this I would not have bought it. This is a rental not a keeper."
2,unpressed,After watching the one on TV i was disappointed in this one.Not enough gore for me and the girls were much better looking on the one on TV.I guess this is what happens when you get old.
1,Big Disappointment!!!!,"Don't expect a tongue in cheek flick when you sit to watch this movie. You see, no matter how good the book was, the movie doesn't get to you as it well should. Everyone is boring, the visual quality is apalling, and when something marvellous happens you just say ...huh?Anyway, if you want to hurt your back for an hour and a half I won't stop you, 'cause I can't. But I warn you: don't think it will fulfill your expectations...at all."
3,The Unltimate 70' Sci-Fi,"The movie ""Andromeda Strain"", was about an overly powered bacteria that was sent inside a probe in outer space and fell onto a small town within the United States. This bacteria that was no virus, killed every person within this town except the town drunk and the baby. A group of scientists that knew about this probe, were brought together to investigate upon this bacteria so they could kill andstop this bacteria from growing and taking over. The scientists go through a wild trip of confusing data and results to find the great everlasting cure, but thats for you to watch and find out for yourself. I personally felt that this movie was filled with a corney 70's twist of starwars due tohow they lived within a small/large official department for research underground and this brought me back memories. It was a very exclusive and interesting video, but i would only recommend it to those sci-fi lovers."
3,Good - but dated,"This is a good story, but it is an old film and lacking in special effects. Also, I didn't feel there was much sense of drama or suspense. Almost the entire film takes place an a hidden lab. There is one semi-dramatic scene toward the end involving a fail-safe procedure. But you kind of get the sense that everything is NOT going to do to hell, so....Basically, don't expect anything like Jurrasic Park.The interview with Michael Chriton, which reveals his personal background as it relates to his writing career, is a positive addition."
2,Not a G Movie,It looked interesting enough in the very beginning and it was rated G so you would think it was kid-friendly. Then came the lingering camera shot of a dead girl with full frontal top nudity and all of a sudden it didn't seem so G anymore so I stopped watching. I then googled the film and it seems that this was just the first drop in the bucket of what should be a PG or PG-13 movie.
2,Pretty Slow,"The premise behind it is okay and the science is mostly intact. However, the movie is not very interesting and I was bored."
5,A taste of what could happen,"I found this movie to be very believable in the sense of people finding ways to kill themselves off, at taxpayers expense. The remake of this movie is so similar to this one that only the more interesting characterizations of this one made me want to own it."
3,Technical Suspense,This is not a disaster movie. In fact the only scenes which come close to that genre are the scenes near the beginning of the movie that depict the dead victims of one small town infected by the viral chemical weapon. The rest of the movie is an interesting step by step exposition of the procedures taken by four doctors to try and identify and contain the Andromeda strain. Arthur Hill gives a kind of one-note performance. The actress who plays the female doctor (do not remember her name) turns in the best performance. It's never dull but it's also never really exciting. It's a fairly cerebral movie.
4,a forgotten gem,"a highly detailed and believable sci-fi film. the pacing is perfect, the acting is top notch, and i was intrigued the enitre way through. I highly recommend this movie. Boy, they dont make em like they used to"
4,The Andromeda Strain- the Original is the best.,"This is a 70's video classic before CG and poor script writing came to the screen. To enjoy this film, one need an open mind and some imagination. Based upon an actual event and the producer got assistance from the laboaratory and government and was encouraged to tell in detail, Andromeda Strain is a classic germ warfare genre movie. Having seen the re-written version and been disappoointed by its cheap copy accented by cg and sensationalsim, the original always wins out. This is a classic movie to have in any movie collection, from it's mysterious start to it's suspensful conclusion."
3,Andromeda Strain Review,"My Chemistry class recently watched Andramada's Strain. Although it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, it was however, very interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was hard to follow but it kept me on the edge of my seat. I would definately recomed this movie to anyone who enjoys Science Fiction."
4,One of the finest 'hard SF' thrillers,"If you're a fan of hard SF and accurate science, you'll probably love this movie. The first time I watched it, the sense of tension and nervousness was incredible. However, if you don't have any scientific training, you probably won't always understand the implications of what's happening, and will miss a lot of the subtle details. Basically, if you've studied any biochemistry or cell biology, this is the thriller for you. If not... well, it's still a classic SF movie, but you probably won't be biting your nails.The characterizations are good; it's easy to forget how unusual it was to see scientists portrayed realistically in the cinema thirty years ago. The movie is also interesting for its innovative use of multiple frames within the widescreen image. In fact, if you haven't seen it widescreen, you really haven't seen it at all."
4,Good Movie,Loved this movie. It kept me interested from start to finish. It's far better than the TV rendition.
3,Disappointed.,Still love the story line but the movie is dated and the acting stiff. I waited a long time to see this movie again but was disappointed in the picture and sound quality of the transfer. This DVD now is in my sister's collection.
2,Not formatted for proper region!,"Attention potential USA buyers: This DVD is not formatted for Region 1 or Region All. Therefore it may not play on your DVD player, although it may play on your computer."
4,A REFRESHING CHANGE!,"Pastor Tautges write directly from his heart, but his words are screened through the grid of sound biblical theology. This is not a devotional book in the strictest sense, but a didactic work on everyday subjects considered from the Scriptures by someone who has experienced hardship himself and has a deep affection for Christ, a passion for truth and a heart for people. I highly recommend Paul's book to anyone who needs encouragement from the Word of God or is experiencing trials and has questions about God's methods."
1,Disapointed,"Pictures were great, receipts were a disappointment, Kentucky has some great foods excellent restaurants I wouldn't recommend too many cook books."
5,Chart #1,Chart #1 defines and explains all of the symbold used on the coast guard charts for navigation. A mus have for any serious boater.
4,"Creative, Suspenseful Plot Will Keep You Guessing","If you like non stop, unpredictable action, you will enjoy this book. The characters are constantly thrown from one dilemma into another. The turns in the plot are many and will keep you guessing until the end. A big plus: anyone can enjoy these books because they are not artificially rift with violence and harsh language in a stooped attempt to make characters more accessible. The result? They are accessible for everyone."
2,Really?,"This story had great potential, but it was seriously underdeveloped. Writing was mediocre and character development was weak. The author did do a fairly good job with research though."
4,Virtual Team Guide,"This book was a great combination of research, theory, and appliction that would be suitable classroom text, guidebook for managers of virtual teams, or resource for research. The mix of writing styles and sections devoted to specific issues is helpful and gives the book an expanded audience. Some previous knowledge of team management and of issues connected with virtual meeting practices would make this book the most useful."
3,Load of sweet melody but poor recording,"The collections itself well deserve the title - lots of sweet, dreaming and classic melodies. However, the bad recording sound has taken away all the goodies created in the album."
3,This is not the John K. Ryan book,"I first read this book while attending a Salesian high school -- and I've returned to repeatedly in the ensuing years. It is a timeless guide to leading a life that is filled with the greatness and goodness of God. I was pleased to recently share it with my children who've also come to love it. So I was over joyed after receiving a Kindle for my birthday to discover it was available for Kindle. I am thrilled to have it but to my disappointment I found that the Kindle version is NOT the John K. Ryan translation -- widely consider to be the best translation. That is not to say that this isn't an adequate substitution, but it is unfortunate that the image used is that of the Ryan translation. I just wish the Kindle version didn't come up when searching for the Ryan book and that the Ryan book was actually available for Kindle."
5,Introduction to a devout life,"The book arrived as described, brand new- I have only started reading it but so far it is a fantatsicly inspirational book! Very happy with the purchase"
5,Truly a useful introduction!,"I sought out this book on the advice of a priest and was not expecting the book to as useful as it was! I was immediately drawn into the book as it explained how a devotional life can be integrated into any state of life. I especially was thankful of the effort de Sales puts into explaining what is proper for one to do according to their vocation in life. Though I am Catholic, a Pentecostal friend once asked if Christians can meditate and immediately lent her this book and she has come back to me with many questions on the meaning of certain words, but has otherwise been very glad to read the book!This book can be easily recommended to anyone seeking a deeper prayer life; young or old, priest or layman, Catholic or Pentecostal."
2,SEXY SCI-FI,"Book 3 continues the bizarre, other worldly adventures for Carol and her crew, although this book isn't quite as libidinous as the previous volumes, it certainly picks up the pace as relates to characterizations and filling in some of the questions that sprung up in Books 1 & 2.The mega-art gallery in the back of the book is cool, but I'd prefer to have had more story pages, or better yet, a batch of Urishihara pin-ups!"
2,Message Lost,My son who is 8 read this book for school and had to write a book report so I also read it in order to help him. Overall I wasn't impressed and although my son is a baseball fanatic he wasn't all that enthusiatic for the story as well.The main plot of the story really gets lost in the endless descriptions of games. The story lacks a lot of details that might help to position it in the mind of the reader. Where does the story take place. How old are the kids? How is it possible that Bobby and Kirby are on the same Little League team when they are far enough apart in age that there is a sister between them?And there are scenes in the book that add nothing to the story - like the scense with them in a tent watching a deer.And the ending was bizarre. Other than it being a little unexpected how does it add anything to the main plot line??Not the best story in my opinion.
3,Long Strech at First Base,The main characters are Kirby and his little brother.They love the game of baseball.They could live on baseball.They play on a baseball team.They had to play a very good team and if they won the game they would be in first place.That means they are the best team.During that game they had the lead untill the end of the game when the other team came back and won.That put Kirby's team in third place.They thought they could have won the game.This book is not the best but not the worst.
2,this book was boring,"I gave long Long Stretch at First Base a 3. I gave it a three because it was a nice story, but it went kind of slow. The story was about a boy who is worried about his older brother who might not make the All- Star baseball team. During the story I couldn't understand why or how they were in a tent, and then all the sudden they were in the house. Overall it was a pretty good book."
2,not really,"This journal is weird, it is too big to be a travel one but too small to be a good home journal. No place to paste wine labels, hard to keep open because of the narrowness of it, has white and red pages so you don't decide, and it has too much useless info inside. I did not like i returned it and kept a small one and a big one separately."
2,poor video quality,This is a poorly made video with dull narration and is not in HD. I would recommend you find a different video to learn about Sydney Australia.
1,Heh? This is HORRIBLE!,"I was shocked by some of the previous reviews. Is there an option to give this NO STARS? I bought this years ago, and I can't seem to get rid of it! A horrible piece of junk! Makes no sense whatsoever, especially the ending (what's with the whole freaking lake drying up all of a sudden??). Don't even bother with this unless you just like to be grossed out by disgusting immature spit games or cheesy redneck acting and dialogue (You a' gonna go out thar? Naw, Ah'm not a' gonna go out thar!) and no storyline whatsoever! It stars nobody and features nothing. Watch it and gag away!"
1,worst horror movie ever,"Blood Lake has got to be one of the worst horror movies ever made. The opening death scene is terrible. I do better horror films in my film class. After the first death at the beginning of the movie, you have to wait 45 minutes for the next and the movie is only 80 minutes long. I will admit that it is fun to see how bad a cheap horror movie can be. A waste of money."
2,Blood Lake is a movie you should skip!!!,"This film is about a group of teenagers who take a weekend getaway for water skiing, drinking and sex. The house that they stay at is owned by one of the young girl's father. A murdering madman (who owned the house before) starts killing the teenagers one by one because the young girl's father refused to pay for the house. I don't have too many good things to say about this film. The water skiing was too long and drawn out and the scene when the group was playing quarters seemed like it lasted forever. Good looking kids but bad actors!! The plot was very weak and the editing was awful! I gave this ** only because of the nice photography which was shot on video."
2,too soft for my needs,"I bought this to replace a similar contour pillow I had purchased from Select Comfort several years ago; the old one seemed to be wearing out. This new one is much too soft to give sufficient support to my neck. I have gone back to my (much firmer) Select Comfort pillow and am now using the thicker side under my neck. After taking a few nights to get used to it, my neck pain has been significantly reduced again."
2,Weird foam,Weird foam feel. Not as nice as the name brand Isotonic or Tempurpedic pillows I've had in the past.
5,Great Pillow for the Money!,"It took me awhile to get used to this pillow, as I am used to sleeping with a mountain of pillows. But now, I can sleep without it!! I absolutely love the support it gives my neck and i no longer wake up with neck pain. I am about to buy one for my husband cuz he is constantly trying to steal mines! A great investment!"
1,Not as Advertised,"The product was represented as a Serta pillow. However, what I received was a generic and was very substandard. I would stay away from buying pillow products from Amazon."
2,Not that great!,"I bought two of these and I really dont care too much for the contour type pillows.A merchant from DynastyMattress threw in two (Queen sized) conventional type style foam memory pillows when I purchased a (Queen 2inch pillow top mattress)from them, and they are huge compared to the much smaller contour style,that I wasted my moneyon -$60.00!These contour type memory pillows, I feel are over rated and just not for meI guess."
2,Not the solution I had hoped for,Not as malleable as expected. Kind of a wierd shape so not really appropriate for supporting my bad neck and shoulders.
4,Wild and Crazy Vegas Guide!,"This book proves that Norm Clarke is the ""go to"" guy for anything and everything that has to do with what's in or not in Las Vegas. It is so much more than a guide, although it has lists for must-see resorts, hottest nightclubs and the Strip's best shows. It is also filled with fun facts on Vegas history, wildest wagers, and famous local characters. Not all of his statistics are accurate (Mickey Rooney only got married 4 out of 8 times in Vegas, not 8 out of 8, and he married Ava Gardner in Ballard, CA, not Sin City), but I still recommend this book as a great source of information."
2,A ONE PAGE FAX - THAT CAME OUT SKEWED...,"Fans of the NBC series THE OFFICE (or even of the original British version) would probably be eagerly expecting this. Well, I am not sure this is something they would want...THE OFFICE is a classic time-management casual game where one has to deliver colored folders, printed faxes and the like to cubicle-enclosed coworkers. As the game progresses, the tasks get more complicated, the time gets reduced and the computer-controlled competition gets fiercer. Bonuses and combos are sparingly awarded. See you again tomorrow at 9.To anyone who has experienced games such as DINNER-DASH or PIZZA-FRENZY this is nothing new. They just added big heads of the cast to the characters.Definitely NOT worth the admission price..."
3,An interesting but flawed effort.,"This CD has an interesting topic, but a severe shortage.The shortage: Bach.There was no attempt to do a Bach-themed effort, & this is quite noticable.Amusing, once in a while. But stuffy fans of Classical might be offended.Overall---meh."
2,not sturdy enough for a toddler,"The necklace is TINY and the chain is rather delicate. The chain does not appear long enough to fit comfortably around the neck of a normal sized 8 year old (who might like this design). The chain is not sturdy enough to last with a younger child. The ""pink"" tourmaline is rather red and dull looking. The stones in the necklace do *not* match the color of stones in the earrings and ring. Overall, this was a waste of money."
4,Magnetic Wall File Pocket,I first ordered this product nearly a year ago. When it came it did not contain the magnetic strip so I returned it and received a replacement that was complete. It works great. I've had it on my fridge for nearly a year now and have had it stuffed full without any problems. I'm ordering more today.
5,Excellent album - one of the all-time best!,"If you like excellent songwriting and phenomenal guitar playing of the country-rock ilk, you will absolutely love this album! In my opinion, Billy Joe is one of the greatest songwriters of all-time and his son Eddy is one of the greatest guitar players of all-time (and maybe the most unknown/underrated, outside of certain circles). All of the performances have a lot of heart and are very moving, be it happy or sad. Grab this album, give it a bunch of listens and I truly doubt you will be disappointed!"
2,NOT for gerbils......but nice to look at,"we purchased two tof those cages, just because they look really nice in a kids room. That's why I am giving it 2 stars because they look nice but do not last very long if you have Gerbils. Everything which is plastic inside the cage, they chewed up. Now we are on to chewing tubes and making doors larger. They escaped so many times, it's not funny. We did purchase a whole bunch of the tubes but most are thrown away, because there are holes everywhere. The wheels are great but get used as a bathroom too and have to be cleaned everyday, unless you like the smell!! I definitely would not buy this cage again, at least not if you have gerbils. I'm not sure, but the constant chewing on the plastic can't be healthy and it's very annoying. I'm looking into getting a 10 or 20 gallon fish tank now."
1,flimsy,"this book was hard to force interest in, for me. The phony accents so exaggerated;it also seemed to me that Balzic is trying to be Peter Falk, and failing miserably. I don't think I'll read another by this author. Very flimsy, especially the last quarter of the book. Would not recommend to anyone. You can read about the plot (if you can find one, that is) in other reviews."
5,A Classic,"My husband and I have been married twenty four years, and we were enthralled with the clarity and understanding of Linda and Charlie Bloom's book: 101 Things I Wish I Knew When I Got Married.The table of contents alone is a gold mine. We went down the list and checked off the concepts that we thought we ought to discuss with each other. It became an afternoon of iinsight and humor mixed with wisdom and incredible feedback of our impact on one another.Thank you Linda and Charlie for making this contribution to peace ful understanding on this planet one couple at a time. This is high spiritual work you both are doing!"
5,really renews my belief in love,this book is amazing. i stumbled upon it in the bookstore and it was the last copy on display. i picked it up and thumbed through it and i was hooked. i'd never heard of the authors and this book. unfortunately i think we give a lot of credit to authors who get on major television shows and some authors that have good stuff to say don't ever get the credit they deserve....back to the book...it's a great book the chapters are short and sweet (but not too short) and as other reviewers have mentioned the couple has lots of experience as therapists and a real married couple. i plan to suggest to my boyfriend that we read a couple of chapters an evening and discuss them. i really like the concepts in the book and think if you're in a serious relationship leading to marriage you owe it to yourself to get this. i suspect if you're already married you can still benefit too!
3,Tips for Couples,The chapters are quick to read - so it gets to the point. I have been reading a couple chapters per day but I think couples can sit and read this together and discuss. It's a helpful tool.
1,Fluffy and lacking incisive insight,"A lot of feel-good language, but little concrete ideas on how to keep your marriage strong. I guess when I saw ""101 Things"" I expected a clear, insightful and eye-opening book. Nope."
4,very uplifting,I found this book to be very inspiring. It reminds me to look at the positive things about my relationship and encourages understanding and kindness in a relationship. It does support my own needs as well and the necessary things to feel fulfilled in a marriage. I would highly recommend it. It's super easy to read and relate to.
4,"Excellent, thorough, covers all the bases","Excellent book, well-written, helps us learn from the experiences of many couples, including the authors themselves. The 101 things covers all the bases; highly recommended."
5,a song,"If you know the tune thats great, if you don't, the book willsing to you! Children will choose this book over and over for the BIGillistrations, the large print and this book is fun."
4,Potentially a really fun book.,"My husband and I enjoyed this book - we were jointly reading it to our 2 1/2 year old. On first read, though, she didn't like it because she thought it was scary. I'm hoping that on the second read, when she knows what to expect, she'll see the humor. It was light-hearted and fun, with nice, bright illustrations. I am buying the casette through ... Book Club because I didn't know what tune to put with the songs. I had a hard time making up a tune that fit the words. Overall, I think that the book has great potential."
2,"Yes, and No","I started with four stars: two for the wonderfully detailed depictions of Venice, and two for the steamy sex scenes. Then I subtracted one star for a confusing, convoluted plot I could no longer believe in after reading the first 60 pages, and subtracted another star for generally unlikable characters. Sarah is certainly a sympathetic character -- Ms. Joyce works hard to make her so -- but I could not like her. As for Sebastian, I didn't like him from the first and nothing changed my opinion."
1,FAR CRY FROM FIRST BOOK,I loved Lydia's fist book. This one was a terrible disappointment. The female lead is so boring and compliant contrary to Ms Joyces first female lead who was independent and could be respected as a woman. I couldn't finish this book. I hope her next is better.
5,A Genuine Joy to Read,"What attracted me to this book when I opened it in a local bookstore was a chapter with the title 'Pig Snouts and Sequins.' With that provacative title, I just had to read on. That chapter looks at Proverbs 11:22, a verse about a 'beautiful woman without discretion.' Well, every woman (and man) I know has met that type of woman, and the author of this book shows a real understanding of her type, and of the verse from Proverbs. I was hooked enough to buy this book, which has truly deepened my appreciation for the insights of Proverbs. Each short chapter looks at one particular verse from Proverbs, and gives some insight into everyday matters--gossip, honesty, temper, beauty-without-discretion, materialism, and the list goes on. I like all the books in this '101' series, but this is my favorite, since I think it is really the most practical book about the Bible I've read in a long long time."
1,The visual history of cars cadillac,"This has to be the worst video of its type. Poor quality production with clips ""Borrowed"" from other automobile videos. I think I'll tape over this one."
4,Fun history of Cadillac,"The other viewer is certainly entitled to his opinion. I know exactly what he's talking about - this video did have some cheesy archival footage & clips. Also, this isn't updated past the 90's, so the ""new"" cars here are somewhat silly by contemporary standards.Nonetheless, I found this to be an entertaining and informative documentary.The video provides a history of the company & the founders, a decent history of the development of the Cadillac from the 1920's to the 1990's, and it has some great archival footage. For example, the video contains rare footage of the first Cadillac off the assembly line, the first Cadillac plant, the first meeting of the first Cadillac board, etc.Even though its not perfect, you can't really find a video solely dedicated to this subject anywhere else. I suspect that, despite some minor quirks, any automobile aficionado or the loyal Cadillac fan would enjoy this film."
2,Great Scope But Not so Fond of speedytoys,the worst compony iv ever had too deal with they cancled my order two times then finaly got it rite.
4,An Excellent 70's Funk Specimin,"Curtis Mayfield isn't so much a household name (although he was much better known in the 70's), but he is one of the definitive sounds of the music that was the 70's... funk. Okay, there was disco too, but funk was the father of disco (yeah, I'm ready for that argument).The driving beats, happy rhythm and playing around with the (then) new synthesized sounds at the time, is what makes the sound, while the vocals are the falsetto that the Isley are so well known for.While you might not know the artist's name, you'll certainly feel at-home with the familiar sounds of funk. This album is a great addition to the well-rounded collection I know you desire to have!"
5,genius,"this man had it all the voice to send chills thru you.words that made you take notice and music that took you&your mind on a trip.and this soundtrack is time-less.it speaks to the listener as does the movie.as writer,musician,producer,arranger,vocalist he was as bad as anyone ever."
1,Disappointed,Unfortunately I cannot say I enjoyed my purchase.In fact I've paid for it but I received my CD literally in pieces.Although the package showed no sign of damage when I opened the package the CD was broken.So far I have not received any reimburse for my loss.Antonio Carlos Barros
5,A classic soundtrack album,"A must have album to an unforgettable film. Curtis Mayfield's Superfly soundtrack embodies to me what was going on in the 1970s. I was born in 1982, so when I listen to this album, I am amazed at how much it also seemed to intertwine with what was happening in the 1980s. The songs that make that point would be ""Little Child, Running Wild, Pusherman, Freddie's Dead, Eddie,(You should've known better), and Superfly"". The soundtrack is timeless."
5,you are in the mayfield zone,"the words and music are chills to the mind.the strings the soulful strumming,the falsetto and the arrangments.this disc is a work of genius you get a real street feel down the alleys and corners.curtis mayfield to me is the king of soundtracks because he puts you into whatever piece he is working on as if you were there.that's the mark of strong writing and feeling your audience.the instrumentals and commentary are treats for people such as myself who find this man incredible.this is a strong piece of music that will last for centurys on end period.it's raw,emotional,poetic,angry,romantic and hip.it's the mind of genius.it's rap before the name it's story telling within a film."
4,Stupefied,"The only problem that this silky smooth seduction, funk masterwork (and soundtrack legend) has is its short length--reiterated with bonus tracks--, flowing second perhaps only to Gaye's WGO (and some of Mayfield's other earlier individual tracks)."
3,Disappointing pressing,"This pressing is disappointing. Highs are literally do not exist. After buying it I found repressing from 70s and decided to try and compare the 2. This remaster sounds like there is a filter that would not let the sound to go through as it should. 70s edition, on the contrary, sound very clear. Music is superb of course."
1,Too bad,"Don't even think this novel will stretch your mind. You'll easily figure out the entire plot and ending by page 80--max. But even this could be somewhat forgiven if the writing was more accomplished; sadly, it isn't.Considering the location and history, this novel is simply a missed opportunity. If you must, buy an inexpensive, used copy."
2,Unconvincing thriller heavy on dramatic tension,"but weak in all other areas, especially lacking in any kind of credibility and poor in creating atmospherics despite the rich setting. In view of the adulatory press it has recieved tempting to conclude that it was another book the critics read, either that or it helps to work in the media if you want a good reception for badly written novels."
1,Poorly Written,"This book is poorly written, lacking character development and plot. If you are fond of Ken Follett, don't bother reading this. There is no comparison."
3,See the Movie...,"This book would probably make a much better movie than it did a book. In my opinion, Bradby could use a better editor."
3,Japan's Imperial Conspiracy by David Bergamini,"Although I knew it was a used item, the cover wrap was gone and the green hard cover was quite stressed. Otherwise the book was intact and I am happy with it."
5,Ingenious,"As a student who actually studied the theory of Analogical Modeling of Language under the author, Skousen, I found this book to be a fascinating and brilliant insight into linguistic analysis. Obviously, some study of language or linguistics is a helpful background for this book, but it is a straightforward explanation of Skousen's theories with ample evidence to back up his claims."
1,Ran out of ink within an hour of use,My daughter was very disappointed. The blaster would not work as described. The markers were low on ink and did not color well.
4,Lindsay's fun!,My Mom bought this for me & I enjoyed using it & creating different colors for all the supplied pictures.
3,Parent's point of view,"My son loves these. He used his birthday money to buy them. Personally, I think you can achieve the same effects with ordinary markers by holding two markers together tip to tip. Much cheaper to do that, even though you don't get the coloring pages, which were kind of cute. I don't think these were worth the money, but my seven year old does."
3,A disappointment for a seven yr old,"This was by far number one on Santa's list, but were quickly pushed aside for some of the more interesting items Santa brought. Thankfully Santa provided lots more entertainment. My granddaughter loves to paint and draw and is quite the budding artist, so it's not the lack of ability that deterred her. They don't always blend well and can be quite frustrating. They also seem to dry up much too quickly. Clearly a disappointment"
2,A little disappointed,"I must admit I had no idea what they were, but my daughter wanted them.I was disappointed that all you do is basically rub the pins together to get another color. This color did not last long so you had to keep doing that little process to get the colors to blend. My daughter who is 7 lost interest quickly. She uses them like regular markers. I could have paid 5 dollars for a new pack of markers. As for the material to use them on, she used them all in a couple of hours."
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Bought three different kits, small to amuse the grandkids when they visit, medium to keep handy for next needed gift occasion. and El Grande for a X-Mas gift for the kids. The pens looked great on TV but didn't work at all when we tried to use them. Dried out too quickly, never mixed the colors so was a very huge dollar amount for low quality markers. Also, didn't notice small print that the El Grande kit MIGHT come in a brown cardboard box--IT DID, I bet all El Grande kits came that way. Looked terrible!"
1,These pens don't work!!!! Unless you like brown mess.,"I am a 9-year-old girl. I got these when I was 8. They do not work at all. Once you blend them, they are brown forever. All your pictures are brown. All you do is push them together. You could do that with any markers. I wish we hadn't bought them. They were a big waste of money and used up part of my Christmas gifts."
1,not a fun experience,"Blendy pens were the #1 item on my 6yr old grandsons wish list.I was so excited to be the one to give them to him this christmas. What a disapointment! They DO NOT work at all as advertised. My grandson enjoys lot's of different crafts and projects, and is very creative in using different mediums but these pens were impossible to use as anything more than markers.We were very dissapointed and I feel this was a waste of money. As always I was happy with the Amazon experience."
2,don't spend your money!!!!,"The markers dried out too easily, the colors did not blend like the commercial indicated, very dissapointing to the kids!"
1,El libro está en mal estado,"El libro como tal es excelente, yo lo lei hace tiempo y es uno de mis favoritos. Lo compré para darlo de regalo de cumpleaños y se supone que era nuevo, sin embargo, el que recibi tiene la carátula deteriorada y se nota que es usado, en ninguna parte advierten de esta situacion y en la descripción de la orden dice ""condicion: nuevo"" cosa que es falsa."
2,Stupid. Discredited.,"This is reasonably well-written and constructed drivel. You don't want more UML in your life. The basic ideas of Model-Driven Architecture have been realized with things like Object Constraint Language, and that's the direction we should be heading."
1,Better than a sleeping pill,"The most boring, rambling book I've ever read. Was Wray being paid by the word? If you have problems falling to sleep, this is the remedy. I have issues with buying a book and not completing it, both as a courtesy to the author and as a return on my investment. This book is the exception. I managed to make it through 150+ pages of a 300+ page novel and dozed off so many times that my chin bruised my chest. This is easily the best sleep aid on my bookshelf."
3,Programming astronomical formulae,In an attempt to program the Hulett Packard HP 50g calculator with necessary astronomical formulas this book has been helpful. I use a calculator while observing at an observatory. It is portable and it's information is more conviently organized to use without interrupting the observatory's computer..
3,Celestial Mechanics,"This is a surprisingly complex book, despite it paperback-like format, it's almost a college level textbook. If your looking for a comprehensive look at the mathematics of celestial bodies in motion and can handle the heavy emphasis on calculus, trig, and matrixes; this book might be ideal.If on the other hand you simply wanted to understand the basics, without higher math skills, you will probably find this book inaccessible. Clearly, there is a need for a Celestial Mechanics For Dummies book, albeit for a tiny market."
5,Heavyweight workhorse,"Been using these printers for many, many years. They're getting hard to find......so buy spares..."
1,NOT DANIELLE STEEL'S BEST!!!,"IF YOU ARE A DANIELLE STEELE FAN LIKE I AM, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FLOW OF THIS STORY. JESSIE CLARK IS A WOMAN IN EXTREME DENIAL OF THE FACTS CONCERNING THE CHARGES AGAINST HER HUSBAND, AND INSTEAD OF BEING TRUE TO HERSELF, SHE FIGHTS FOR A MAN THAT DOES NOT DESERVE HER LOVE OR DEVOTION. IT ENDS IN A TYPICAL DANIELLE STEELE FASHION."
2,Review for Now and Forever,I thought I was ordering a hardcover book and received a paperback. I already had it in paperback and sold this one at a yard sale. It could have been my mistake. I will be much more careful in the future.
3,Not Satisfying Enough,"The story is long and drawn out. The last half of the book drags on interminably. First, I can understand a co-dependent personality forgiving a cheating husband. But Steel fails to satisfactorily explain the motivations for Ian's affair at the beginning of the novel. Couldn't he have waited six hours more to ravage his wife, instead of picking up some bimbo??? I did not buy the fact that he ""needed to prove his manhood"".But what left me totally unsatisfied was not the ending as some reviewers have stated here. It was the fact that the woman who ""accused"" the man of rape got away with it and didn't receive any sort of comeuppance. At the end of the book it would have been great to have had this woman exposed for the fraud that she is and justice would have been served.And you wouldn't believe for one moment that she did not get any money out of Jessica and that her primary motivation was ""revenge"". Totally unbelievable."
2,"Disappointing,Predictable","Started out I had SO much in common with Jessica, come to find out what a female ""Wimp"" she is, I could NOT relate to her. After Ians affair, and during his JAIL stay, Jessica had a chance to be with an exciting Jet-Set man, who seemed perfect for her. But like an idiot, she can't stop thinking of Ian, then the end of the story is quite predictable. I can't respect a character as stupid and wimpy as Jessica, I'm used to reading about strong women who have their head together. Not the kind who kiss up to men who have strongly betrayed them."
5,A great book!,"I really enjoyed this book. I like the fact that the characters grow and mature. In the beginning Jessica is weak and immature, clingy and dependent. Meanwhile her husband is a cheating slimeball. It seemed as though the only things keeping these two together were guilt and obligation. After some very difficult times, though, they both grow up. I was happy with the ending, too."
1,Still getting eaten alive,"I have a small back yard, and my husband and I love to sit out there in the evening and chat, or read a book. Unfortunately that rest and relaxation has been taken over by mosquitoes! I bought this product after reading some reviews and thought I'd give it a try. Having multiple dogs, it was very important that whatever I put back there be safe for them, too.We sprayed the yard as directed, but noticed absolutely no decline in the number of blood sucking monsters lurking about. The seller did provide speedy delivery, and it arrived on time, unfortunately the product simply did nothing for our mosquito problem."
5,One of the sickest thrash bands ever.,"This album is pure brilliance to me. Not only is it part of the soundtrack of my life but this band(and album)next to Death, Kreator, Sodom, and Death Angel are the main bands of the 80's thrash era. It's hard to find an album of that kind that can compare.Damn Sacrifice, where did you go?"
4,Great Little Flash,"This is a great little flash for everyday use. Doesn't recycle fast enough to capture fast moving events at a wedding, but for informal gatherings it has all the power you need to punch up those family candids and group shots. Controls are clean, simple, easy to use. I would recommend this."
3,It works...,"It works so I can't complain but it is slow to recharge and sometimes it doesn't recognize to fire. I only used it twice when I really needed light but when I don't have time to fuss around and hope that it works, I just use built in flash. If I am in more controlled area and I can take my time with adjusting the light, I would use it.It works, but just not reliable for me so I wouldn't get it again. If you are just starting and looking for any cheap flashlight, this will work to start with."
2,"Great bounce feature, but defective.","We bought three of these, two Canon and one Nikon. The Nikon recycled much slower than the Canon. When I contacted Cameta and spoke with Rich by phone, he asked me to try it awhile longer to see if the recycle time improved, and if not they would replace it. The flash got worse, and sometimes will not turn on at all now. When I contacted Cameta again, they now say it is beyond their warranty (because they asked me to try it longer) and they will not replace it. The Canon flash is still working fine, but I would have to caution folks about the Nikon and Cameta."
2,Be aware - Long Recycle time for this flash.,"Attached to my Nikon D60, I experienced flash recycle times of 17-20 seconds. I felt that was unacceptable, even for casual indoor shooting, so I sent it back. Guess I should have known for $60, so you get what you pay for."
4,Great for the money,Works right out of the box. Add 2 AA's and ready to go quick recharge and the iTTL works fine with my D5000.
3,THE RELAXING MUSIC,"The pieces in this album have mellow harmony and dulcet melody of the trombones and the violins, which make you feel relaxed. On the other hand one would enjoy the intricate phrases and the lyrical tone of the improvisation played by the piano in LA DUDA DE BELEN."
3,How Low Can You Go...,"Really only for people who are already fans of Low. Or maybe as an adjunct to Low In Europe. This simply follows Alan and Mimi on the road, at home, going to church, etc. There is live footage interspersed but it is not complete songs. There are also some scattered performances of Alan in random places singing songs and some rehearsal with Retribution Gospel Choir.The most interesting story would've been the time between Low In Europe and this one, but of course that was not filmed and was a difficult and understandably private time. It is touched upon here - Alan's hospitalization for psychological issues - but there is still a certain vagueness. So the biggest revelation in these 70 minutes is that Alan is a pothead, which causes him added distress because he's a Mormon. And that is no surprise to anyone who's a fan.So if you're a big Low fan - worth a rental. If not - skip it and check out Low In Europe first."
3,Mobius Band - The Loving Sounds Of Static,"A rock band? Why not? Thus the Mobius Band and their debut THE LOVING SOUNDS OF STATIC mix indie rock with some electronic elements -- and the results come out pretty good. While not as impressive as M83, the Mobius Band make a strong case for themselves. They certainly hew more towards the rock side of things, but there's a bit of New Order that peeks in on ""Radio Coup."" ""Twilight"" starts off bucolic and goes emo by the time the vocals come in. The layering in ""Close the Door"" makes you almost forget about the drum machine in the background. Some of the album, alas, doesn't distinguish itself either as indie rock or electronica, but that can't be said for ""I Just Turned 18,"" a coming-of-age track that rings true. ""Philadelphia,"" similarly works an multiple levels. A promising debut from a label that knows no boundaries."
5,One of the most tallented performers I have heard in a while,"I had the priviledge of watching Lynne Campbell perform live quite by accident about 3 weeks ago in Florida and have been anxiously awaiting the release of her cd. She performed most of the songs on the cd and they are all terrific. She has without a doubt the most natural tallent I have seen. It's like she was born with a guitar in her hands. She can make you think of so many different performers (possibly the next Bonnie Rait) but has a style all her own. She also has the ability to appeal to just about every individual taste in music. From Jazz to Rock to Easy Listening to Pop, etc., etc.... I have a sincere feeling that we will be hearing a lot from ""Lynne Campbell"" and I am looking forward to the release of her cd. It will be a terrific addition to my music collection. I only wish I could have had one to get autographed when I heard her. She has music in her blood.."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Mountie magic fighters, motorbikes, and massive houses.Have a secret ghostbusting organisation would definitely not seem to be de Lint's forte - at least in this earlier book. His Hellboy crossover later on is ok, though.This is a hodgepodge of various mystic and fantasy elements and mythos, as a motely crew of people come together to end up in an Otherworld setting via the huge and strange Tamson House.Doesn't really hang together all that well."
5,"Magical, enthralling book! A must-read.","This is the first of DeLint's books that I read many years ago and I keep on going back, and then back again to read. It has many elements that will hook most readers -- whether it be adventure, romance, or magic. Keeps your interest from page one... The only thing wrong with this book, is that it ends! I have read many of DeLint's books and each of them have that special touch that keeps one's interest from the very first page. Kudos to Charles DeLint!"
5,Timeless classic,"I really believe this is the best book de Lint wrote. Myth and magic in modern Canada, Mounties facing magicians, a house straddling the worlds, timeless bards, ageless wizards, unnamed evil, all sorts of fun stuff.10+ years later, I still enjoy reading this book. I've worn out 2 other copies and I've given several copies to friends. Great book, buy it!"
5,A Truly Magical Book,"In Moonheart, Charles de Lint proves himself to be one of the best urban fantasy authors. This book blends Celtic & Native American folklore with ""real"" life situations. The narrative grabs ahold of you from the onset and never lets go. The only regret I had was when I reached the last page of the book, and I realized I had reached the end. In all, it is one of my favorite all-time stories, and one that can, and should, be read time and time again without losing its magic or flavor."
3,Not as much depth as I expected,I had just finished reading Svaha when I picked this up. While I thought the storyline and concepts were great - I was disappointed with the delivery. For the length of the novel I found that the character building was lacking. During the course of reading any given book the reader takes on a concern and interest in what is going to happen to the characters - this book failed to deliver that for me. I felt that this book could have been accomplished in a much shorter version as the depth of character building was not there and thus I found myself quickly skim reading through the text towards the end just to be finished with it. I am not in the slightest put off of Charles de Lint. I still considered this a good read - just not one I would repeat again and the tempo and style of this one just wasn't for me. If you are looking for a book that is fast paced and still offers lots of connection with the main characters - this is not one I would recommend.
5,Fantastic,"A truly wonderful book, one I have reread many times over and will read again and again. One I would recommend anyone to buy."
2,Trying too hard to be a phenomenal fantasy book,"Not very well written, anti-climatic, dragsThe idea was great but not well executed"
5,Moonheart just may be my favorite fantasy book ever!,"As the first Charles De Lint book I discovered, Moonheartturned De Lint into a favorite author of mine forever. Hischaracters are diverse and likeable, female characters arenever wimps, and he weaves mythologies of several culturestogether deftly.I've been devouring books since I was a small child, andmy first taste of Moonheart sent me back to the bookstores,special-ordering everything that could be acquired by De Lint.If you enjoy fantasy fiction - the kind you can't put down,Moonheart is a must-have!!"
3,Where is my concubine?,"This is easily the weirdest celebrity record ever made. Large portions of it consist of Glover reading excerpts fromOak MotandRat Catching, two dreary nineteenth-century books he republished after altering passages at random. It also features bizarre original songs and wacked out cover versions of older songs. The best original is the hilarious rap like ode to self pleasure ""Auto-Manipulator"". The best cover is his inside-out version of ""These Boots Are Made For Walking"", which he sings like a whiny, sobbing ex-boyfriend. Very strange album, much like the very strange man himself."
1,SUCKO,This is terrible. Especially the track where he modifies his voice to resemble an entire boys choir. Pure music torture. And he was so good in back the future!
5,I Liked It Very Much,"Summary:When Viscount Birkinshaw sought to marry off his impertinent daughter Kitty to the Earl of Edgerton's equally spirited brother, it seemed like the perfect match. But neither of the titled matchmakers could have anticipated the consequences of their scheme. For from the beginning of Kitty's journey to meet her husband-to-be, there seemed to be some question as to which lovely young lady was the bride, and which the conspiring domestic.As Kitty and Emily, her maid, are brought from the decorous academy run by Miss Marchmont to the sprawling elegance of Edgerton Park, it becomes necessary to keep a sharp eye out for the regal bride and the beautiful imposter..My Opinion:My shear impatience led me to skipping in depth descriptions just to be able to get to the dialogue since the story was that interesting. I was lucky and downloaded this for free but would have easily paid $4 and not felt bad about spending the money. Happy Reading, Enjoy"
2,I am not very impressed with this speaker,"The ratings of high efficiency (96db), 80 oz strontium magnet, 150 watt continuous and 300 peak just don't carry across in sound. I used these speakers to replace 12 inch woofers in a PA cab. No crossover just a high pass capacitor on the horn so this speaker gets everything 2k and down. I have it hooked to a crown 200Watts a channel PA amp so power is there and an adcom preamp so I am using sound electronics. The sound from the these woofers is just not very clear or very powerful. It really seems like the old Radio Shack junk woofer and horn tweeter sounded better than these replacement woofers with much better ratings.(you gotta love old radio shack. Even their cheap speakers were good)I think I will reinstall the Radio Shack woofers. I am glad I kept them.Had I to do all over again I would pass these Speakers by. Money poorly spent.Shame too, they do LOOK really cool."
1,don't buy this edition,i spent $45 on this cheaply made book -- the illustrations were black/white photo copies that had no gray tones -- most illustrations were worthless -- this obviously the print version of a kindle book. maybe it's kindle-worthy but the paperback is not worth it. shame of the publishers. i feel duped.
4,Swinging 60's history,"Having this available in CD at last is a treat for those who have dug the band's output before or even more for those who haven't heard this memorable, propulsive outfit. Sonor is a true Klook flagwaver and all the distinct personalities of the band - Benny Bailey, Ake Person, Jimmy Deuchar, Sahib Shihab are highlighted in the best possible way by Francy Boland's compelling arrangements. Try one and you'll become a fan and want to hear more and more."
3,Could be better,"The overall idea is good, but implementation is poor. The fingerprint powder is chunky, the fingerprint brush too rough, and the sticky tape circles are difficult to lift off from the block. The fingerprints come out poor compared to what one can get using simple graphite powder from Home Depot and a piece of regular scotch tape. After the fingerprinting failure kills the fun, the rest of the kit gives a somewhat dull feeling."
3,COULD BE BETTER,MY KID LOVED GETTING THIS TOY. BUT IT COULD OF BEEN BETTER. SHE BORED OF IT AFTER AWHILE. FINGERPRINTING WAS TOUGH TO DO.
4,Excellent!,I Though this movie had great actors for never playing in any othere movies! hehe and i really liked the plot!
5,beautiful shoes,These shoes are of great quality and the crystals have alot of sparkle. I wore them on my wedding day and recieved several compliments. Great buy definitally worth the money.
3,The funniest diaries ever!,"What can I say everytime I hear the name Adrian Mole a big smile comes across my face, the diaries have to be one of the funniest sets of books I have ever read. I have read The Lost years a few times now and althought I dont think that it is the best in the collection it is definetley funny and is a very important part of the series and I would recommend all Adrian Mole fans to read it. Anybody out there curious about the Adrian Mole books must pick up a copy of the Secret Diary of Adrian Mole aged 13 3/4 and read it now!"
2,Depressing,"In the earlier diaries, it was easy to see Adrian as a ""lovable loser."" It's hard to find the lovable loser in this book. Adrian apparently forgets everything that happens to him, learns nothing from the books he reads, and has absolutely no human perception. Yes, there is some of this in the previous books, but in ""The Lost Years"" its all we're exposed to, and its very jarring considering Adrian's age. Heap on top of this Adrian's selfishness and you have a main character who is very hard to latch on to or care for.In fact, there is no growth on Adrian's part. Throughout the book (particularly the last few pages) any development as a person is done to Adrian, not by him.I'll read the next diary because I enjoyed the first few so much, but this one really shook my faith."
3,Disappointed in Adrian!,"I loved the Secret Diaries. I loved and empathized with Adrian and also his friends and families. However, in this book, I feel disappointed in what Adrian has become. He had so much promise and was gaining so much insight and beginning to lift himself out of the self-obsession that is being a teenager at the end of Growing Pains. However, it seems in this book that he has developed into a petulent and lazy adult who seems incapable of consideration for others. Will I read the Cappucino Years? Of course. I still love this kid, even when I don't like him. If you haven't read Secret Diary or Growing Pains, start there."
2,Dissapointing,"I was dissapointed with this book, because it seemed very monotunos. I liked the original diary much better."
2,very unoriginal,"i got this cd cus it was in the bargain bin and it sounded heavy. i can explain what it sounds like pretty easily: A less talented (believe it or not) less techno Static X with the guy from collective soul singing. It's hard to expect much from young bands on small labels, but come on..."
2,"THE KEY WORD IS ""EXIT""","In the year 2500, men have become sterile, women rule the world, and the human race is headed for extinction. Several female scientists devise a way to go back in time to a 21st-century spaceship which is crewed by half-a-dozen or so fertile men. They hope to extract from these men enough ...Do you really want to hear more? The movie resulting from this bizarre plot was probably meant to be satiric and campy but it comes across as simply dull and dopey and its obviously scant budget doesn't allow for anything interesting in the way of sets or special effects.The ""star"" of the proceedings is Costas Mandylor who admittedly looks ""fertile"" but who isn't likely to linger over this dud in his biography."
5,A Stand Out,"I do not usually like classical compilations, nearly always opting for full length performances, but this disk clearly rises above the norm. Generally exceptional performances combined with the always exceptional sound engineering of John Eargle make this CD an easy purchase and one that is frequently replayed in my home. For me, it's one of those albums that makes a great accompaniment to reading, drinking a glass of red wine, talking with my partner, or just plain old daydreaming.Joy and peace to you all."
1,"""THIS MOMENT IS MINE"" MAY BE A SELF-FUFILLING PROPHECY","This is not meant to be a personal attack on Ms. Moore or her fans, however, it's obvious that marketing is what brought this album into the fore front of the r&b charts because unfortunately, Chante's vocals do not transfer into being a lead vocalist. She sounds much better when she is heard backing up Aretha Franklin on ""Hurts Like Hell"" from the ""Waiting to Exhale"" soundtrack. She's a superb back up singer. And although she getting lots of radio and video play, her music is not timeless. In other words, people will not be singing her music 20 years from now. (Ie: her music will not will not have the longevity of soul classics like Aretha Franklin's ""Respect"" and Chaka Khan's ""Tell Me Something Good)."" Chante' is very pretty and should stick to modeling because as her cd title says, ""This Moment is Mine."" And from the looks of it, her musical career is just that.............a moment."
2,What is this?!,"This is the most inane music. Who cares if Chante has a man? What is that?! Try writing some more far-reaching lyrics that address more social issues. Why does this music get so much attention? Try listening to Rage Against the Machine who write lyrics that actually make you think instead of numbing your brain. They have so much intelligence and metaphors woven into their music (and they actually write and play their own music, too, I might add). Stop googling over this pop R&B music just because MTV says it's cool. Think for yourself! I'll give her two stars for encouragement. --Kelly Magovern"
4,An artist who can go as far as she chooses...,This is one of the most positive songs (Chante's got a man) that I've heard in years. It reaffirms my faith in Black women. There is SOMEONE who recognizes a good man. Thank you Chante!!!
5,"FINALLY not a depressed, sad love song for the 99 and beyond","I love this song. She is describing my Good Man. I got a good man. I was so sick of hearing the cheatin songs. The ""He hurt me,"" ""I did everything,"" ""I'm sleepin with yo man,"" songs. Don't get me wrong, there are some dogs in this World, but it's good to know that some women know, there are some sweet men out there. Good work CM."
5,I'VE GOT A GOOD ONE,THIS SONG MAKES ME REALIZE WHAT I TRULY HAVE EVERYDAY. THERE ARE MEN OUT THERE WHO WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A QUEEN.
5,Saggio - incredible native american flute artist,"Saggio now has 4 or 5 CDs out, this was his first. ""Thunder of Silence"" is healing and medatative to the soul. It puts your mind and body at rest. I've known many a massage therapist that use this CD in their practices.The smooth soothing sounds that Saggio weaves thoughout this cd are incredible. If you need a CD to unwind with at the end of a long hard day at work... ""Thunder of Silence"" is a MUST HAVE!"
4,Good recorder/player,"I've had this cassette player for over a year now. It still works very well, and I've used it often. Good features and sound quality.I did buy an adapter so that I could listen to it with earbuds. Unfortunately, the cassette player is designed to play through only ONE earbud, the left one. You can buy some old school looking headphones from the manufacturer that will play in both ears. Regular ones won't work. This is the one negative in the design and operation that I've noticed."
3,Microphone doesn't pick up very well,"This little recorder would work well for a lot of purposes, but I needed it for a situation where I couldn't just lay it out in front of the speaker -- nothing clandestine! Just too distracting! Anyway, it was difficult to get a good clear recording in these circumstances. I can't imagine trying to use it to record a lecture, for example, unless you have permission to set it on the lectern and the speaker never wanders off!"
4,Works with 1 Flaw,"Works perfectly but the cord has trouble staying connected to the phone..Which makes Windows discover and undiscover it a lot..But once you find a way to move the cord and keep it there, it works perfectly"
4,Straightforward value.,"This product was delivered in a timely manner, in good working order and as promised. It's a short little cable, works perfectly, and appears well made.I don't use it much, as it lives in my briefcase for when I am away from my desk (cradle) and need to charge or synch my Treo when I am ""on the road"", so I can't vouch for it's durability under hard/regular use. Insofar as what I (occasionally) use it for, this very inexpensive little cable seems to be perfectly adequate for my needs."
1,not worth it,There are plenty of other informative books that provide indepth info and explanations. Only provides brief summaries then on to the next thing. Purchase something else worthwhile.
5,comprehensive and inspiring,"The New Wellness Workbook, which was new to me with this 3rd edition, is the most comprehensive book that I have ever seen on wellness. Going far beyond cultural and medical ideas of health, the authors inspire us to look at our own wellbeing from the widest perspective, including emotional, social, and spiritual perspectives. As a holistic GP (family MD) I know that this book will be at the top of my recommended reading list."
5,Simple Yet Amazing,This has been one of the most amazing yet simple books on natural health and healing that I have ever read. Travis and Ryan have presented a fascinating way of looking at improving health that is easy to understand. I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in improving their health.
4,Grammy best jazz vocal album,"why still nobody write something about this album.Just to remind all of you, this is the winner for the 27th annual Grammy award for best jazz vocal category."
5,skin care,"I love this skin moisturizer/lotion. It is very light weight and blends into the skin well, leaving the right amount of moisture to the skin."
2,Awful...,"I have very sensitive skin and this did not work for me. The first night I put it on I woke up to about 5 or 6 new bumps! It broke me out terribly! I dont have very bad acne, but this sure did make my face worse!"
1,do not buy this item!,"this product really irritated my my skin, turn my face super red will not be buying this product again! If anybody who is reading this your better off using a moisturizer from cerave which is really gentle"
2,"Not as pictured, not very supportive vendor","I bought two boxes of this moisturizer and was concerned that the boxes that I received, while named the same, came in boxes different from that pictured (and different from that which I have been using.) I asked about it and the vendor was terse in response, indicating that the photo of the item is not their responsibility or control. They offered that I can return the item but who wants to go through that effort if they can just get a good answer to their questions. I also questioned the age of the inventory as the color of the moisturizer in the tube was different that the tube I had just finished (purchased from a local store.) I was always given the option to return the item and I chose not to because of the effort required on the purchaser's part, but I suspect that the answers I was given may not have been entirely true."
2,Bad fit.,Dash cover was of pretty good quality but the fit for 95 Bonneville Pontiac was an awful fit. It needed to be at least one and 0ne half inches larger especially along the front edge. Sides were a short fit. Cut outs were fair fit. Sun can blister and crack exposed area. Back to the old towel to cover the dash.
2,Still a ways to go musically...,"Punk rock has come to embody a variety of musical styles since its inception. Unfortunately for this group, the catchiest songs appear on the second half of the CD -- long after you may have written them off as Sonic Youth wannabes with Hank Williams hearts."
1,Rip off of Lovely Bones but with happier ending...,"I read this and martin's Shade of Maple based on numerous 5 star reviews. Amazon reviewers are usually right on but this guy seems to have a following of readers who adore him. I am so glad a read these books BEFORE I selected them for my book club, I would've died of embarassment. This book's storyline is a rip off of Lovely Bones big time. Capitalizes on a parents guilt to ""hook"" reader, much like Shade of Maple capitalzies on a women's ""gee I wonder what my marriage would be like if I married BoB..."" thoughts everytime we wipe our husband's pee drips off the toilet...except the character in Shade of the Maple actually does it!"
5,"Great Book, Great Charity!","I found out about The Gravel Drive through the Make-A-Wish Foundation because the author is donating $1.00 from every book to help sick children. (I also found out he gives $1.00 from his first book to breast cancer research - I just ordered that one!). While I really want the author to sell a lot of books so he can raise a lot of money for Make-A-Wish, I think the true value of The Gravel Drive is how it can change your relationships. It just totally makes you think about your kids and even your spouse in a new way. I am grateful to Kirk Martin for being a giving person, but even more grateful that he had the courage to dig down deep and share his innermost struggles and feelings as a father. It is worth it because there are many people who will be changed because of it."
2,Way Too Morbid,"I'm confused why readers are giving this 5 Stars. It is a well-written book, a quick and easy read, and DOES make you realize how precious time is with your children and to not take time for granted, BUT this book was EXTREMELY morbid! Not only was it morbid throughout the entire book, even the ending was morbid. I checked out THE SHADE OF THE MAPLE at the library today and plan to start that soon, and I am hoping that book is better than THE GRAVEL DRIVE. I wouldn't say ""Do not read this!"", but if you're expecting to read a 5-star book, then I'd say ""Reader Beware."""
4,"nice, soft duvet","We got this duvet to fit our full/queen down comforter. We have the full sheet set - top sheet, fitted and pillowcases that have lasted over a year and are still in good condition. The duvet cover is equally nice and soft, but seems a little large, which is not a huge issue. Otherwise, quite happy with the purchase and the Wamsutta flannel as a whole."
3,It's okay,"It's soft, but not super soft. And it's such a light pink that you can barely tell it's pink at all. My 2 year old daughter does love it though. I'm just afraid that with washings it will pill (the fabric seems a bit thin) and lose the little bit of softness that it does have."
4,"works great, shipping time not great",This cable works great with my ipod nano 4th generation. I can plug the ipod into my home stereo and my boat stereo. The downside is it took forever to ship and arrive to me.
3,Not long lasting,"I purchased this for my mom's ipod last Christmas. She doesn't use them that often, but they didn't even last a year. I had to buy her another cable. Might have just been a bad one, but I didn't risk buying the same one. They were a good length though."
4,I like the connectors,"This cable feels of quality construction.Its a cable that connects my ipod to my car, it does the job, its built well, its priced well and it looks good."
1,unreliable,"I have owned this for less than a year and already it has had problems. The connection is becoming increasingly tempermental, such that the sound will cut out all of the sudden and I will have to fiddle with the cable to get it to come back. This happens about 3-4 times an hour."
3,Black Blues from the Deep South,"The music is good overall. It, however, is not exactly what I was hoping for. I was looking for more Black guitarists specializing in guitar playing. This album while good, includes piano and bass. It does not include B.B. King, Leadbelly, Muddy Waters, or John Lee Hooker. Nevertheless.. i will enjoy the ""Southern Blues"" on this album"
3,Nice but some quality issues,"Overall this is a decent piece of furniture. At least it's ""real"" wood and not press board. There are some quality issues however - one shelf on our unit arrived cracked due to, in my opinion, inadequate packaging. Also two of the corner posts were obviously fabricated from two seperate pieces of wood glued together. Also the decorative rods on the back are all somewhat warped. Still it isn't a bad price for real wooden furniture, and it looks good - better in person than in the photos. Assembly was straightforward. I would give it a 3.5 if fractional stars were allowed."
4,"Crystal clear, unearthly melodies.",What lovliness! I am transported by the voices of these women to Hildegaard's abbey. The poetry of these chants should not be overlooked either. Read the liner notes and get the translations. They are gorgeous.
3,Copyright 1908,"As a beginner, I found the dive straight into scale exercises a bit difficult. I found the text entirely too brief. I would have appreciated a finger chart that is not 100 years old, and repeatedly recopied to the point that I could not figure out what part of the Sax was indicated in the Figure. Maybe I will use the book in a couple of years after I learn the parts of my Sax."
5,Catchy Song,"This song really didn't jump out at me until today, when I heard it on 3 different stations at the same time. It is very catchy and all night it has been stuck in my head! Better than Britney Spears. Lopez is the Ricky Martin for men."
2,Not THAT bad!,"Personally, I think that the song is pretty good, but I like Jennifer as an actress a lot better. :-)"
4,GOOD SONGS AND GOOD PERFORMANCE,Dear Jennifer: I love you as an actress.You are a STAR. The reason is...you FLY.Your performance on these songs is professional and very good but...I don't feel you. Selena sang from the heart zone. You were there.I'll still buy your CD so please don't take this the wrong way.Keep FLYING as long as you can.I wish you Great Success.Michael
4,Cant dance to this song? Keep watching Happy Days reruns.,"Ive only heard the first single.I liked it before I heard who it was from.When they said it was a new one from Jennifer Lopez I thought that someone made a mistake over the air.No mistake.If you like ""Pleasure Principle"" from Janet,You'll like this one.If you cant dance to it,Keep watching your old reruns of Happy Days.Art in Houston."
2,jennifer lopez won't make it with this album,i think jennifer should stick to acting. she has a good voice but her songs could use some work. so far i have heard the songs she has out on the radio and i can say that i don't like any of them all that much.
1,"No, no, no...","I'm sorry, she's a talented woman, but this album is as bad as her interview attitude and ego. I got a copy (illegally) and the only decent track is the one with Marc Anthony, and only because she only sings half the song (which, incidentally, is not this track). Don't waste your time or money on this one. Let her get voice lessons first and then we'll talk. Sorry Jen Jen, this album was not ""Out of Sight,"" not by a long shot."
4,Jennifer Lopez is gonna make it!!,"First of all ""If you had my love"" is not with Marc Anthony, but its a pretty good song regardless. It has a good beat and Jennifer does a good job. I definitely think that she needs to train her voice a little more, but it's not bad. If you like dance songs this is a good one. You go JL!!!"
1,It was not all see could be,She is great don't get me wrong. But to go into singing. I think she should stick to acting. I love her I really do but don't push your luck
1,never in this lifetime,"Jennifer Lopez is a good actress, although she's not great, and singing sure isn't her thing. She has absolutly no voice range. If you are going to be a singer you should truly be able to sing in more than one octave. Besides, her dancing isn't all that great either. Next time she has a chance to sing live she should think before acting! Thank god for those backup singers!"
5,Jennifer has it goin on!! Especially her SEXXXY looks!!,I think that lopez is a GREAT singer and dancer. With her looks she can easily go very high in the singing career. (not that she needs the money) So don't diss her ladies you are just jelous of a hot talented WOMAN!!
4,MAKING IT TO THE TOP!,"I think that Jennifer has what it takes to get there with all the other fine singers. True, right know she may not be the best but she is certainly trying. I think that her single ""If you had my love"" is awesome and she could really continue from there. I am glad that she is trying out her other talents and as we can all see it is working marvels. We all love to see her acting, dancing and now is just another turn to see the most wonderful and beautiful woman in the world (yeah Sofia Loren, Jennifer bumped you out of first place!)"
1,OVERPRODUCED CRAP!,"I hate crossovers - and this is one great example. Jennifer Lopez should not quit her day job (though her ""acting"" isn't that great). This song is over-hyped and over-produced. All you hear are back-up singers. I give this 1 star because amazon.com doesn't have ""zero"" stars. Blaaah!!"
1,It's called desensitization.,"Jennifer Lopez is an actress. She is not a singer. Her voice has absolutely no range and her musicians are playing five year-old, generic pop beats that wouldn't bat an eyelash.But hey! When all of today's American pop music is like that, and MTV supports it because of all the money it brings in, who the hell cares about talent!"
1,"Sounds like Chante Moore's ""If I gave you love""","Jennifer Lopez is beautiful, but I don't think that singing professionally is in the cards for her. Besides, ""If you had my love"" sounds just like Chante Moore's ""If I gave you love"". Did Rodney Jerkins, who produced both songs, think he could fool us? Please Jennifer stick to acting."
1,She's only good to be a Movie Star,"With all the hype around her, I think that is the only reason why this song is so popular. Her album is stupid. She has some stupid lyrics and her first single doesn't compare to the other that's out there. The chorus and the lyrics of most of her songs are redundant and somewhat corny."
5,"I love Jennifer Lopez, and the new song is tight!","Jennifer Lopez's new song is very original and I would love to hear it while I was clubbing somewhere. The video is also awesome and it seriously has made me consider wanting to be an artist in the music industry. I have a pretty good voice, and Jennifer going out and doing this is truly inspiring for me. I have recently decided that Jennifer Lopez is my role model, not only do I want to look exactly like her now that she has really gotten into shape, but I would love to have all the confidence and success as her. I wish Jennifer my best regards and I sincerely hope that her new hit will make it to the top of the charts. Love ya! Nahal in Dallas"
3,Not bad!!,"Actually, neither song is as bad as everyone would think they'd be! Jennifer may not have the vocal stylings of Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston but, under pop music's spotlight, she actually does a damn fine job of holding herself up especially given the fact that she's an actress turned singer which always makes one a target for public scrutiny! Of course Rodney Jerkins' producing the first track and the heavy background vocals, allows her to actually shine on her first single. The second song is the true gem of the CD but if you don't know spanish... well, let's just say you won't gather much! Overall a nice and solid effort! I predict Jennifer will have a bright future maybe not as a diva but definitely as a good pop artist!"
2,This song needs improvement! @-]--,"I think that JL's song If you had my love is alright, but she is a way better actress, and I think she has very little musical talent! Thanx, bye. CYA"
1,Marc is the Master / Jennifer Just Doesn't Cut It,It's a beautiful song. Marc Anthony is the only beautiful voice we should be hearing in the song. Jennifer stick to show biz don't give up the day job. Then again I guess that's where brown nosing gets you. She has no talent for singing and its such a shame that people that have the talent for singing have a hard time breaking into the music industry but like they say it's who you know and who you rub elbows with. By the way I dare you have her sing ACAPPELLA.
2,"Great music and lyrics, but Jennifer can't sing.","In my opinion, I think Jennifer Lopez is a beautiful actress and a fantastic dancer. She did a tremendous job in Selena, as well as her other projects, and she should be applauded! I am proud that she is a Latina! Even though she's a very talented actress, the sad truth is that she cannot sing! Her voice sounds weak in her album and it is evident that her voice has been enhanced. This was very apparent in her live performance on the David Letterman Show. Her back-up singers over-powered her singing, and she had trouble staying in tune and hitting the high notes. I felt kind of sad for her because I did want her to succeed in her singing career, but after all she does have her acting career and drop dead gorgeous looks to fall back on. Not too bad, don't you think?"
5,Beautiful Voice and Beautiful Woman,"You are a great singer. You are my insparation to listen too. Coming from a singer myself i can say you have a very talented and beautiful voice. You are very talented and I can't wait to hear more of your music. I love your song ""If you had my love"". It is great. Make more like it. Keep up the good work."
2,Jennifer's voice too thin,"Normally, it's hard to listen to a song when the singer's voice doesn't sound too great. Jennifer's voice is pretty thin, and I can barely hear her voice. It sounds as if she can't sing any louder. It even sounds like she's trying to sing as loud as she can, which makes her voice sound strained instead of in a comfortable volume. She'a great dancer, though, but not a really great singer. Geri Halliwell's voice sounds better than hers. At least Geri's has some depth to it."
4,Extremely talented .,"Not only is she a talented actress and beautiful, she has the voice to accompany it also. I think the song is fantastic and would hope to hear more of the same from her in the future."
1,Nice try,"Jennifer Lopez has become a greatly known star, thanks to the great opportunity given to her, to represent the belated singer Selena. Ever since this great achievement, her fame has multiplied at least three times. Now, she has decided to sing. It was very noticeable during the filming of the movie, that Jennifer Lopez loved the idea of performing. Shortly after, she began to persue her career as a ""singer"". This CD is a nice try from the actress. Though she doesn't have a nice and strong voice, the style of this music is very reliable for weak voices. Perhaps she will learn to become a better singer with time. Lip-singing to this simple music, is not going to bring her to the Hall of Fame, but for now we can enjoy dancing to the rythym of ""If You Had My Love"". Anyways, if Britney Spears has gained fame with THAT voice, Lopez deserves a try."
1,what are people buying this album for?,"ok, i'd bone her. but that doesn't mean i would ever want to hear her sing!"
1,Why is she singing?,"She's trying to do too much. Acting is one thing, singing is another. Her voice is of very poor quality, and it's enhanced tremendously by technology. The lyrics are simplistic. The only saving grace is that the chorus is catchy. But, a better singer could have done more with it. I give it a boo!!! Needless to say, I won't be rushing out to buy the CD."
4,I didn't know she had it in her!!,"When I heard Jennifer Lopez was putting out a CD I thought it would be a disaster like so other actresses(i.e. Jennifer Love Hewitt). To my surprise, she was terrific. I didn't think she had a voice like that. Regardless of what some of these so-called reviews say, I think that she is as good as if not better than some of he top singers such as Monica, Brandy and a few others. This song has a great beat. And as for those people who think she can't keep a beat, you obviously don't know much about music because you can't dance or sing let alone play a role like ""Selena"" without knowing how to keep a beat. Jennifer, has got a great singing career ahead of her and I'll be first in line for her new album on June 1."
2,She's not my fave,Her voice is OK but I'm sure it's only decent because of the mix. She's a great dancer but a great singer she's not. Her voice is thin and weak and I bet she sounds horrible live.I'm not a big fan of hers anyway -- I think her ego is a little too big for her britches.
5,I REALLY LOVED THE FIRST CUT OFF THE CD,"HELLO , MY NAME IS JULIE AND I JUST BROUGHT THE SINGLE ""IF YOU HAD MY LOVE"". I THINK THIS SONG IS SO BEAUTIFUL. FOR ONE, I HAD NO IDEA THE SINGLE OR THE CD FOR THAT MATTER WAS GOING TO SOUND AS GOOD AS IT DOES. I REALLY DIDN'T THINK JENNIFER WOULD PULL THIS SINGING THING OFF. BUT, I WAS WRONG . JENNIFER, I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU GO GIRL! KEEP DOING YOUR THING. PEOPLE WILL HAVE THEIR COMMENTS , THEY ALWAYS DO. I LOVE THE SONG AND THE VIDEO , MY FRIENDS ALSO. WE FIRST THE SONG ON THE RADIO , I WAS LIKE WHO IS THAT? AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A NEW SONG FROM TAMIA. SO YOU KNOW , YOU MUST BE GOOD."
5,Ricky Martin watch out!,"Ricky Martin your time is up. The latin king is dead long live the latin queen. Here we go ole, ole, ole Jennifer's hot ole, ole, ole! Jennifer's musical superiority is bound to be the driving force that supplants senor menudo in the latin charts! Jennifer's assets are on display for all to hear and see. She is truly an asssstronomical talent who's true talent is hard to asssert. Her asspirations hass no limits! Assume the best for her!"
1,"Good music, poor singing",I think that Jennifer Lopez should just concentrate on her acting career. The music is OK but I really did not like the lyrics and her voice. I really do not think she has a great voice. I like her better as an actress.
3,palmers,"i have been using this product along with the one for stretch marks. it has helped with the appearance of stretch marks too. as for the firming, i work out when i use to product to see progress. it smells like cocoa, its not too strong."
1,Palmers Cocoa Butter Firming Butter,I was not very happy with this product. I use 3 bottles and can't tell that it did anymore for me than the walmart brand of cocoa butter. It did nothing for firming and has a bad smell to it.
2,can get past the odor,"while the cream itself is pleasantthe odor/scent is so unpleasant to methat I cannot bear to use itI will not buy it againand if I can't foist it off on a family memberwill have to pitch itand yes, I did try it a number of times"
1,#6 is missing because the CD creators are song stealers!,"My mother is the composer and copyright owner of ""I'm a Mean Old Witch With a Hat."" Music For Little People (Spooky Favorites) has no rights to this song, and the version they had on here had been illegally modified (just a few words & notes), in addition to the fact that they were illegally advertising, selling and making money off of her copyrighted song (of course giving her nothing). That's why they've removed it, but I don't know why they haven't removed it from the list or listening samples. My mother (Carolee Curtis Green) has also written a few other adorable little Halloween songs to go with ""I'm a Mean Old Witch With a Hat,"" and hopefully will be selling them on Amazon very soon. Carolee's Halloween songs are a lot of fun for kids to sing and act out :)."
3,Spooky Favorites,"This cd is not as much fun as I thought it would be. The songs have way too much dialogue & are just not enjoyable. Maybe an older child would like this, but overall this cd just is not that good."
1,SCARY!!!,"This cd is too *#@%# scary for me and I'm 38 years old!! If you are really into scaring kids, this will do the trick."
2,"What happened to ""I'm a mean old Witch?""","I purchased this CD for one reason, ""I'm a mean old witch."" It is listed on internet sites as being song #6. When I got the CD, ""I'm a mean old witch"" is not even on the CD! I notice that many reviewers said that this was their favorite song, but it is not included anymore. I am disappointed. I listened to the CD 1 time through and the only two songs that I like are ""If your scary and you know it"" and ""Dem Bones."" My 3 year old sat on my lap while we listened and seemed scared. I think that there must be better Halloween CDs with fun songs for kids. This is not the one!"
2,Missing song,"My kids like the music on this CD - but we were actually looking for the song ""Mean Old Witch"" and it is listed on the Amazon site - but not on the CD."
1,Awful music and too scary!,"I really don't think this should be called music. Most of the CD is scary noises, and the actual ""music,"" well, it's just awful."
5,The Authoritative Book...,"...on Old Hawaii native horticulture.First published in 1940, the revised edition from the 1970's is expanded and even more comprehensive.This ethnographic, ethno-botanical (is that a word?), anthroplogical, and folkloric book covers the the Hawaiaan horticultural complex, the effects of Gods on planting, native terrain, planters' knowledge, planters' tools and methods, how planting differed from island to island, principal and minor crops (taro, sweet potato, breadfruit, banana, coconut, pineapple, kukui, wauke...), animal husbandry, plant folklore, demographics and politics related to food, festivals, geology and geography of the different islands, and more!"
5,Bears win,Absolutely amazing for any true Bears fan. Vibrant and Large! It has been through all types of weather and has stuck perfectly to my truck window
4,Delos compilation,"This is a compilation CD of extracted movements and selections from other Delos CDs. Unless you are looking for a sampler, you may want to seek out the original Delos disc for the complete version of the various works."
1,Suction Cups don't fit well onto holder,"The plastic holder has 2 keyholes in it in which to insert the suction cups.However the ends of the suction cup are far too big to fit in the large end of the keyhole. After several minutes of work, you can get it stuffed in enought to hold, but it is never going to slide up and lock in the small half of the keyhole. It will take 10 minutes of fumbling to get 1 package ready to mount on the window. Crazy!This looks like someone took an old design and got cheap with the suction cups. We had purchased these years ago from a different source, and the suction cups were larger, fit in the hole and slid up to lock. Done in seconds.Also disappointed that I found these at the local 'craft' store for about 1/2 the price after I received them."
4,Fascinating View of Montparnasse,"Although I cannot attest to the scholarly quality of ""Man Ray's Montparnasse"", I believe that Lottman provides insight into this Parisian art district.The reader learns about the different bars/clubs that were important. He learns who met where; the locations of various artist studios; and the general feel of the era. The dissent in the da da movement and the surrealist movement was significant.Man Ray's neutral role in all of this is interesting. Lottman makes it appear that obtaining portrait sitters was one of Ray's primary goals. That along with women and his cars.I enjoyed the book and believe that there is much to be learned from it. Caveat: If there are historicals errors as the other reviewer mentions, then it is difficult to know what you can and cannot believe."
1,Not worth it!,This band isnot comfortable and the back velcro is just too weird to even understand! It's not adjustable and it's overpriced! I highly recommend another elastic band over this one
3,Great Except for the Clip,"Very nice design and leather quality, but the clip and post have already stopped ""locking"" -- if they could fix this I'd buy another! Also the clip and post does not ""ratchet"" keeping the phone in thedesired position on the belt--suggest that they get a ratcheting post and clip to replace what I received."
2,Its ok,"I was happy with the product until today. I went to put the phone back onto the clip and it snapped. So now I'm unable to clip the phone onto my belt. Hopefully they will send out a replacement. Besides that, it looks great!"
5,da pittbull project,This album is the bomb! I love it! The songs have real nice beats. I recommend everyone to purchase this album. You will love it too.
3,excellent and can get better,THIS IS A HARD-WORKING BAND THAT NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED BECAUSE THEIR MUSIC IS VERY CAPTIVATING AND THE ONLY THING THAT THEY NEED IS MORE PROMOTION.
4,history & artistry,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends JADE SONGS as a good guidebook for beginning collectors fascinated by its stories & histories, as well as photographs of the author's collection of sculptures, seals, chops & snuff bottles, set against a bamboo background.Charming stories & interesting information. It deserves a place in every collector's library.Simply & well done, although it does need some proofreading!"
1,disappointed,I spent more money listening to the jukebox for the song cry and little white cloud that cried. I played them over and over until the restaurant would ask me to leave. When I saw I could buy this CD I ordered it right away. I was very disappointed with the quality of it. I don't remember Johnnie sounding like that. I am sorry buy I won't play it any time soon.
2,"A little too ""southern"" for comfort","There are some interesting and good points to this book but on the whole I wouldn't recommend it. There is a huge emphasis on ""submission,"" a Biblical concept. This book, however, takes it to the extreme to the exclusion of almost everything else about women's ministry.Women are to be in submission to the elders. I agree. Everyone in the church should be in submission to the elders not just the women. We should all be in submission to one another, not just women to men.The ideas for ministry are frequently simplistic - ""make coffee???""On the whole, if you're from the north, and don't think all women should be doing is ""cultivating domesticity"" this is not the book for you."
4,Links CE 2000,"Looks great and plays well with my 14"" iBook in OSX. However, it often slows to a crawl or freezes. Mostly after coming out of ""sleep"". I have to use the reset button and reboot. Luckily, you can start back where you left off. Maybe a patch will come soon."
1,system requirements,This game will not work on a 233 mhz mac product. It was not even beta tested on such low powered machines. The minimum system requirements are at least a G3 333mhz mac with 16 mg video card and a fair bit of ram (probably at least 97 though more likely 128 mg of ram).
2,Links 2002 for Macintosh,This software did not meet expectations. The program was converted from the Windows platform and there is definite evidence of the old version (title page still has 2001 labels!). Documentation is not sufficient and it's difficult to figure out how to use the basic features and setup. Needs more work!!!
1,Bug Ridden Disaster in OS X,"Is this what we have waited for? I do not know how the OS9 version works, but DO NOT buy this for OSX. In the space of one hour I had 3 Kernal panics and never once got past the first hole without crashing. Visually, the game looks great, I just wish it was playable. This software is not ready for release as an OSX application. I returned it to Amazon."
2,problems / help with CE,"This game was released with a pc version of the course converter, outdated ATI driver updates and outdated Gameranger software (for online play). All of which is really inexcuseable.The game, in many set-ups, requires serious tweaking to run properly (i.e. lower screen resolution / graphic settings)....It would be worth your while to check this out if you want to enjoy this game at all."
1,Play the real thing! You'll be better off!,"This software leaves a ton to be desired. I can't believe the software doesn't work any better than it does and it's a very poor conversion from the Windows version. The software has very poor documentation and NO support from the publisher. An example of the quality is the fact that the program is packaged with the year 2002 and when the program is actually loaded, it's labeled for the year of 2001. Where's the quality control check? The best advice, to play a real round of golf and save your money."
1,I can't even install it,I always get a Error type 1 (a memory error). It won't install. I have 768 MB of Ram. What a thrill to have a game that won't load.
5,excellent,I have a PowerBook FireWire labtop running OS 9.1 with 128Mb memory and this game works flawlessly for me. It has never crashed nor have there ever been any graphics problems. I play the game with every bell and wistle at a maximum and have never had a problem.It is nice to play a video game that is actually challenging and requires some attentive playing. The courses are beautiful and the sound is wonderful. I recommend it to anyone interested in playing golf at home.
5,CE for Mac is Beautiful...,"Don't be fooled by some who have experienced problems with this game. No, it isn't perfect but it's darn good. Better than Links 2000 by a long shot.The graphics are incredible. Amazing realistic ball flight and putting just like the real thing! The variety of courses that can be played is amazing. Ever wanted to play the 17th at the TPC @ Sawgrass? Have at it with Links CE.Yes, there are some problems with CE in OS X...but not nearly to the extent reported in these reviews. In OS 9 the game performs GREAT...Keep the faith --- this is a great game."
3,Mountain Lion,What great software which is not being shown off to its best advantage by not being compatible with Mountain Lion. The graphics and the versatility of the game-play would be so good on Apple's latest OS.
2,Wish it worked better,"I had high hopes for this game. Pre-ordered and waited months. The Graphics are beautiful, the courses are challenging, but after a few weeks of crashing every other time I played, I've purged the game from my files and am using all that memory for more productive endeavors. A major disappointment. I refuse to re-configure my computer for a game."
1,Light at the end of the tunnel,...It looks like it worked well on certain Apple hardware. Maybe a graphics card issue???? Maybe if we all cross our fingers ...
3,Good Graphics but Clumsy to Use,"Links 2002 for Mac is OK, but not great. First, if you are an IMac user like me, you'll need to change your screen resolution to 800x600 for this product to even work. The IMac system has the right graphics card, however the program just cannot take the high quality resolution and it bombs the whole system if you don't turn down the resolution.The second irritation of the software is you need the CDs to make it work. I'm all for protecting intellectual rights, but come on. CD Swapping? You need disk #1 to start the program and you need other disks to do other steps (like loading golf courses). In all a very clumsy way to handle what should be a great game.Bottom line, it's graphically appealing, fun to play, but very clumsy and does not take full advantage of the IMac graphics capabilities."
4,A story with a twist,"My family have been happy fans of Dr Seuss and we enjoyed this book, it's quite funny because as a adult reading this to your children, you can't help but think that there is a message in the story aimed at the adults !!!! That's the way I saw it anyway !!!"
3,its okay,yertle the turtle is a little bit of a harsh story. Yertle wants power and has no problem stepping on the little people to get there and he eventually gets what he deserves. its worth reading but its not my favorite.
2,thrift shop~,"'as new' should not mean a dented cover,torn out inscription page(leaving the imprint of 'this book belongs to' on the page after it!)and food(?) stains on inside pages!EW.Very disappointed."
2,A bit disappointing...,"I bought this book for my 21 month old as she loves so many of the Dr. Suess books. We didn't even get through the first couple of pages before she was bored with the story and illustrations. Maybe she'll like it better in a few years, but for now it is just sitting on the shelf..."
5,Dr. Seuss understands leadership,"Yertle the turtle is a great book on leadership. It teaches you how NOT to be a leader. Yertle ordered the other turtles to pile up in order that he could be on top and be ""king of all that I see."" In the end the turtles collapsed and Yertle was back on earth with the rest of the turtles.We see so many leaders that are like Yertle. Climbing all over others to get to the top. They often take the big fall much as Yertle did.True leaders will develop those who work for them. The other ""turtles"" will elevate the leader to the top creating a sound foundation to allow the leader to stay at the top.Don't be like Yertle."
5,Yertle the Turtle,My twin 6 year olds love this book. We have read it for night time stories over and over again. I also bought the audio cd so they could listen along.
4,Party edition Dr. Seuss,"The copy of Yertle we received is the party edition, with a metallic green hardcover; I wanted the old style cover. Still, a party cover is appropriate for a birthday gift, binding seems solid, and it is the original everything else we love. Great lesson in the Yertle story, where the turtle king learns a lesson about wanting too much when he should be content with his comfortable, happy existence. Another story is a lesson about the perils of bragging too much...Fun book that teaches good values."
4,FINALLY! A race car toy that works as it should!,"Our three-year-old LOVES this toy! We saw the toy on display in the store and our son fell in love. We decided to give it a try and am happy to say it performs exactly as the box describes! Also has a nice feature of storing the cars, and folds for storage or for taking to Grandmas."
5,Cool Cars,My 5 Year old Counsin Loves this toy. The cars run pretty fast and he loves te action. He also loves the way you can have the cars chase each other and crash. For His birthday I'm thinking of getting him the thrill loop so he can connect it to the halfpipe raceway. Overall this toy is great. Everyone was playing with it from my 3 year old niece to my 53 year old mother! I would say that this isn't a good toy for children under 5. The cars are big enough for them to grip but the winder takes a little muscle and putting them on the raceway can get a little tricky. But once you get them on its loads of fun.
5,they just kept playing,we bought this for my son's birthday party. we had to tell all the kids and some adults to stop playing and come get some cake. my children still play with this race track everyday. the fact that there are no batteries is a BIG plus.
2,"Good ideas, poor execution","When my son received this toy as a gift, we were initially delighted to have a battery-free toy that really was easy to put together. However, I had a feeling the Halfpipe Highway might not last, and sure enough, ours lasted for three days before breaking. The ""revving"" mechanism on one car broke completely, and it seems to have lost steam on the other car. I can't recommend this toy."
3,"Speed Stars, some good, some not so......","Speed Stars are great, all of the other tracks allow the kids to wind and just watch the cars go! This particluar one requires a little manuevering to get the cars just right to get them to race. You cant just set them on the track and watch them go. Though I recommend Speed Stars, I wouldn't recommend this particular track for younger children."
5,Speed Stars Halfway Highway,I really like the speedway. My grandchildren (four and up) find it easy to use. There are no batteries! Hurray!
5,great toy!,"Our soon to be three year old LOVES this toy! The whole family has fun playing with it together. If the cars are cranked long enough they make it around the track over four times!This is the most ideal gift my son has ever received! It is age appropriate, doesn't use batteries, and it is fun for the whole family!"
3,BE CAREFUL WITH THE WHEELS,"THE MAIN REASON FOR MY REVIEW IS TO LET THE PARENTS BECOME AWARE THAT ONCE THE CARS ARE WOUND UP THE WHEELS CAN REALLY BURN YOUR CHILD IF HE/SHE PICKS IT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RACE. I DON'T CARE THE AGE RANGE, I WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD AND GOT A BAD BURN ON MY WRIST.SO BE CAREFUL AND EXPLAIN TO YOUR CHILD NOT TO GRAB THE CAR ONCE ITS CHARGED UP THE BACK WHEELS CONTINUE TO GO AND YOU COULD GET HURT."
2,Cars lasted 2 days :-(,"My (4 year old) son received this racetrack for Christmas and my initial opinion was, YEAH, no batteries needed. Unfortunately my joy was short-lived as the cars broke 2 days later. My son loves the racetrack and quickly figured out how to wind up the cars and place them in the correct slots on the track. The problem is after 2 days of not even what can be considered full time play, both cars stopped functioning and cannot be wound enough to even go but a few inches. I placed a call to Playschool (Hasbro), and they were very accommodating and will be sending replacement chassis for the cars within 3 weeks time (the warehouse is closed after the holiday for inventory). I was told that additional cars are available for the set to purchase, and depending on the price and whether I can locate them at a retail store, may pick up 2 in the meantime. Overall my son enjoyed the set when it was functioning however for the price of the toy I expect it to last a bit longer than 2 days."
1,Doesn't work,My 3 1/2 yr old son was very disappointed by this toy. The cars only make it around the track once before rolling over and falling off the track. My wife tried to call the company support number and the people there barely spoke English and did not even know about this toy. This was a total waste of money. I don't even fell right donating this junky toy to the Salvation Army.
4,"Jeremy Northam as Amerigo, in The Golden Bowl","I thoroughly enjoyed this film because I am a HUGE Jeremy Northam fan, and although I did find his Italian accent in the movie a little disconcerting (his excellent English is what makes him a fine actor) I still managed to view the film with satisfactory results. Since many reviews given here have offered a glimpse into what the movie entails, let's just say, overall I loved every minute of it and I recommend it to anyone who loves period films...Thanks Jeremy for making my heart palpitate!!"
4,A Lovely Bowl,"I was taken with this Merchant Ivory production of Bowl, undeniably opulent and likely the best-looking of all the Merchant Ivory productions. It is near-perfect visually. Most important, I feel Thurman has given a valid interpretation of Charlotte - an opinion not widely shared. It would have been easy to play the role as a cool, reserved fashion plate; Thurman instead chose to play the character as a still maturing, somewhat insecure girl. It is a vastly more honest and truthful depiction - and certainly much more difficult as an acting choice. A passive portrayal of victorian feminine mystique would hardly be news nor much of a challenge for an actress like Thurman. I've never liked her more than in this role."
2,Film Ok,I found this film to be slow moving. Some of the acting was good and some of it wasn't. I wouldn't see this film again. I'd like my money back.
5,Henry James at his best.,"After reading the book and seeing the movie, plus the presentation on PBS this video will keep the essence of this great story ready for me to view at anytime. In other words, I love it."
3,So-So,"The photography is appealing, the performances by Kate Beckinsale and Nick Nolte are professional, Jeremy Northam is disappointing (and that Italian accent needs some work)in a really pallid role, Uma Thurman is pretty bad but the biggest problem to my mind is the fact that the story is unengrossing and, basically, unbelievable--at times even silly."
2,Not so Golden,"I agree with the reviewer from Cambridge, MA. The only actor I had a problem with was Uma Thurman, who carried no weight or presence in her role. I didn't know who she was or how I was supposed to feel about her, yet the crux of the movie rested on her shoulders. As a result, the movie seemed tepid and dull."
5,About the best the film genre can do with Henry James,"First let me say that I am an admirer of Henry James and that the Golden Bowl is one of my favorites. Secondly, I feel it is impossible for a film to capture the psychological subtleties of any literature, let alone Henry James. Having established that, I must say that the film is probably about as good as possible. My only real objection is that the ending is portrayed as ""happy."" No Henry James endings are happy; they are ambiguous. Reread the ending: it is not a happy one for any of the characters but it fits the psychological development of the novel. So, the film is a good film: the acting is fine (I thought Angelica Houston was excellent); Thurman's character is not dignified enough but otherwise all have done about as much as can be done in an essentially simplistic medium. The use of symbolism was adequate, too. But, let's face it: Who can possibly translate Henry James into film. Let's be generous."
1,Avoid this one,"A warning, to all who enjoy fine movies, and especially to anyone who reads Henry James with pleasure: this movie is a horror, badly written, dismally acted (as if by teenage amateurs), melodramatic and superficial and vulgar, at times even cartoonish in the famous Merchant Ivory settings. James's psychological penetration is difficult to capture in a film, but an infinitely superior job was done 30 years ago in the BBC version with Cyril Cusack, unfortunately only available now on used VCR -- a performance too quiet for today's clamorous market, but quite superb.As for this one, centered on the clumsy inept performances of Beckinsale and Thurman, unless you can see it as a very clever satiric send-up of its own genre and of American wealth and ""culture"", the only reason to watch it is to see just how bad an ambitious and expensive film can be. If you haven't that perverse interest, avoid it."
2,"Unsatisfying, horrible casting and acting, don't just give MI a pass","I have to agree with the negative reviewers here, I have not read the book but books are always better than movies period. I hate these english actors that are cast as Americans, Beckinsale and Bale are the two prime examples but there are many more.The acting was universally bad here as well, Nolte seems very wooden in particular but Beckinsale is not far behind, the only decent acting was by Uma Thurman.This felt like an incomplete study throughout, by far the worst MI movie I've seen. MI should stick with the English Victorian/Edwardian periods that is it's forte and leave everything else to those who would know better. I'm glad this was a rental for me, not worth more than that."
2,Nothing Golden here.,"I kept waiting for a twist in this movie that never came. Maybe I just didn't get it. This is my second Henry James novel to movie that I have watched and not enjoyed. The other movie, Turn of the Screw, has a rather disturbing ending. Golden Bowl just ended. I found Nick Nolte's line delivery to be more like he was reading from cue cards. Northam and Beckinsale are the only redeemeding factors in this film."
4,Jeremy Northam miscast,"The only crack in the movie is the casting of Jeremy Northam as Amerigo. Northam, with his phony Italian accent, pretending to be an Italian, is incredible, a bit hard to take. Couldn't James Ivory have cast a real Italian actor in the role?"
1,Boring!,"This movie was very boring, it was hard for me to beleive the actors and enter into the story, I could not wait it to end. I do like Uma thurman has an actress and the atmosphere and all the beautiful costumes was great but it could not help to save this movie."
3,"The Golden Bowl Not Just Cracked, But Broken","Novels don't always transfer to the screen with suitable pacing and power. Of all the James novels that might be adapted to a visual medium, ""The Golden Bowl"" seems perhaps the least attractive. The depth and force of the piece is in the genius of the various characters' internal reflections. The film gives us not these, but instead just the bare bones of the plot, which in itself is not much to chew over. Oddly enough, the film, rather than the novel, deserves H.G. Wells' criticism that James here resembles a hippopotamus trying to pick up a pea. The symbolic and the suggestive are reduced to the clumsily literal both in dialogue and directorial insight. The actors do the best they can with the dialogue they're given, but when of work of brilliant interiority is reduced to externals, it becomes unconvincingly empty when it's not laughable"
2,would have gotten one star....,if it weren't for Jeremy Northam's performance. This movie dragged on and on and on and on... I only finished it because I felt compelled to do so. The characters seemed unreal and the story did not translate well to the screen.
5,excellent,I really admire this interesting book.It has not only inspired me but it has given methe impression that this is the book that I wouldlike to put to use!
5,"Easy, easy, easy!","I love the way the author explains what's going on in your body as food interacts with processes like producing (or NOT producing) fat! The intro by Dr. Barry Sears (""The Zone"") was impressive, and this book is SO great to have when eating at fast food restaurants. Thanks!"
2,Not for low carbers,"Unless you have already lost weight and want to maintain it, do not waste your money on this book. I hope it is helpful to some people!"
1,Too academic,"The author's writing style is academic and boring. It must take a special skill to take a series of exciting historical events, and turn them into a real snoozer of a book. Although (I assume) the details are historically accurate, when it comes down to actually reading them, it is such a chore that it makes the pain of turning the pages out-way the benefit of the knowledge. For someone who is genuinely interested in this subject, I was really disappointed. The book could not hold my attention, and I tried several times."
2,Sharp German Author,"The author is a well informed German, who relly knows his stuff. It seems he expects the reader to understand German as well. He goes into too much detail for the layman and there are too many big words obscuring the meaning unless you look it up. He uses improper grammer therefor it is confusing."
1,So FRUSTRATING and PAINFUL to read,"I bought this book because it has excellent ratings. But when you open the book, be prepared to look up a bunch of vocabulary words. Also, if you don't know much History, you will be pissed off that you cannot understand anything in this book. What annoys me the most is that the author uses big complicated words. He seems like he wants to seem smart, but it really appears like his ego got the best of him. If you don't know much about WWI history and don't have a super advanced vocabulary then DON'T get this book."
1,Not what I expected,Not what I expected when I bought this book. Most of the book is about Germany in the early nineteenth century. It would have been nice if the author could have related the past to the present. Unless you like old history do not buy this book.
2,Extremely poor writing for a good subject,"This book obviously has a lot of good information in it. Nevertheless, it is written poorly. It is very hard to understand what is important and how it fits together. Most sentences are two to three times as long as they should be. Some are worded in a way that one has to ask ""What does that mean"". If you want to work your way thru it, you may learn a lot, but not without a lot of unnecessary hard work. This was rewritten from a previous version. Why wasn't this attacked in this new version?"
4,Wild inflation,Interesting as the people involved with this inflationary period were incompetent and vicious. A lot of details that I did not know from previous references to the Weimar period. A transition to democracy from a militaristic society was a disaster. Frenchbungling was just icing on the cake. Find it hard to believe this kind of chaos could happen in the future.
4,Those who do not understand the past are doomed to repeat it.,"Those who do not understand the past are doomed to repeat it. This historical retrospective on money-printing (""Quantitative Easing"") and its result, will give pause to anyone reading it, as it draws clear parallels to what is happening today on a much larger scale."
4,"Great, informative book, but can be difficult to read/understand","Great book, and I highly recommend it, but the author can be difficult to understand, as his sentences can be long and obtuse, and his style of writing seems almost 100 years old. There are videos of him on youtube. When you hear him talk, you will see what I mean.Overall, highly recommend this book to anyone interested in history, money, Weimar Germany, Austria, Hungary, hyperinflation.LOVED the diary and letter excerpts in the book!!!"
2,"Catchy title, but poorly written","The book does a mediocre (at best) job of telling the story of Germany's hyperinflationary period from 1919 to 1924. The author basically just i) drops names of people, places, and events without giving the nearly enough background information to help the reader actually understand and follow the sequence of events, ii) frequently notes the deprecation of the mark vs. the pound, and iii) includes some anecdotes from letters written by various people during the period. I also didn't like the writing style, content aside.I raced through this book just to be done with it. I'm sure there are much better options if you are interested in the topic."
4,Excellent Read,An excellent history of events and the day of reckoning when a nation depreciates its currency beyond recovery. The results are total chaos and severe social destruction.
5,Alarming and educational,"High unemployment, wild swings in the stock market, fortunes made and lost - and then it all comes to a screeching halt. The result: Starvation, riots, chaos. ""When Money Dies"" is a frightening look at what happens when a country's government makes all the wrong decisions. It's a reminder of just how bad things can really get."
4,"oh la la, la ley!","I wandered into the world of La Ley by accident-flipping through my digital cable channels I ended up on MTV-S and saw the video for ""Siempre"" off the ""Crazy/Beautiful"" sndtk. All I could think was ""wow""! Bought that disc and I havent looked back. I speak minimal spanish at best, it doesnt matter. This band totally rules. You couldnt ask for a better disc (unless its La Ley Unplugged!"""
5,Muy buen Disco,"Se acerca a Invisible, y deja de lado el sonido electronico que caracterizó a Vertigo.Canciones como Eternidad, Aqui, Paraiso, Fuera de Mi, ya tienen indicios de ser clasicos de la banda.Se puede decir que este disco tiene influencias notorias de Duran Duran, y algunas otras bandas de la talla de ésta misma.Si les gustó Invisible, tienen que comprar este disco. Y si pueden verlos en vivo, no se pierdan la oportunidad, porque suenan muy bien..."
3,aqui es lo mejor,"La cancione ""aqui"" es una de las mejores que han llegado a hacer, pero todo el cd es una decepcion para los que les gusto vertigo. Con este cd se fueron mas atras que invisible, con letras y musica mucho mas calmadas."
5,La Ley es La Ley,Si eres fan de The Cure Y de La Ley.... este album es el mejor que podras escuchar. Es una buena combinacion del estilo musical unico de The Cure y con la letra maravillosa de Beto Cuevas...
3,"some bright spots,but rather diapointing overall","La Ley has alot of talent,no doubt about it,but the problem with this particular recording is they try too hard to create ""radio hits"".some of the songs have great parts , but then give in to kind of cheezy,typical alterna-rock chorus'.That having been said""amor y fe"" is my personal favorot tune,it has a sort of 80's british pop feel to it.Beto 's voice can be annoying at times,but seems to fit nicely when they play natrually...but at parts he just seems to want to belt out the lyrics in a grand way,which frankly he just isn't all that capable of doing.This sort of reminds me of U2's ""achtung baby"" at parts.I would recomed this if you like alot of the modern rock you hear on american radio today.But if you have taste similar to mine, I would just download ""amor y fe"" and pass on the rest."
2,Uno menos uno,"Vaya si que esperabamos mas de este album. Cuando empiezo a escucharlo siento gran emocion, pero a medida que pasan las canciones la poca capacidad de composicion termina por hundir un album que parecia tener otro destino. La calidad de arreglos musicales tambien se apaga con el transcurrir del album. Es mas notoria esta diferencia en las rockeras ""Delirando"" y ""Ritual"" o la muy infantil ""Amor y fe"". Alguien entendio el proposito de ese bonus track? Si iban a guardar algo para el final con tanto misterio, al menos debio ser una grata sorpresa, no una cancion cualquiera con un acompanamiento de guitarra mundano. La inestabilidad que tiene el disco es incomprensible. Esta banda tiene para mas, definitivamente."
4,Better with repeated listenings,"I recently got digital cable which includes MTV en Español -- and thank God for it. I soon caught a few La Ley videos, and saw them promote their Unplugged special. Wow. As I'm already a big fan of Soda Stereo, this trio is quite similar in their approach. ""Eternidad"" starts off the disc wonderfully -- great vocal range harmonies by front man Beto Cuevas are accompanied by rockin' guitar and bass (and a French rap!). The other tunes which stand out are the incredible ""Aquí,"" whose video is the perfect vision for the song; ""Tierra"" is a beautiful poweresque ballad; and ""Verano Espacial"" is a bit like ""Tierra"" in that it's very, well, beautiful, yet really gets your foot tapping. The other songs are good for the most part, although ""Ritual"" seems out of place, and I personally could do without the quasi-political ""Paraíso."""
4,Some songs DO stand out...,"This Cd is very good, but my personal favorites are ""Eternidad"" and ""Aqui"". They have a sort of ""galactic"" kind of feel. The french incerpt in Eternidad is very nice. Although some songs sound like their early work with the hard beat of the drums. Overall, OK Cd."
1,Highly Subjective and Outdated Scoring System,"There is new research by Linda Bartoshuk of Yale University that scientifically proves that there are 3 levels of peoples ability to taste. What type is Robert Parker?Google ""Do Taste Buds Make The Wine Critic?"" and Linda Bartoshuk.This wine is a 92 and this one is a 87 and this one is a 89.5....lol!"
4,"Almost saw them live, but for my $#@% brother...","Ah the summer of '79- I was 15- My brother, 10 years older, had picked up a copy of ""You're Never Alone..."" which he loaned me, plus ""Mott Live"" & I was hooked- Imagine my excitement when I heard that Hunter, Ronson & crew were coming to play a show on Sept. 15,1979 in Presque Isle Maine- We were living on a farm in Centreville, NB, a hour or so drive away- I told my brother & we made plans to go- A couple of days before the show he told me he couldn't make it- I was devastated, but dealt with it- The day of the show I asked him if he was up to anything that evening & he said he was going to the concert- I know it wouldn't have looked cool having a younger sibling along, but to this day, some 27 years later, I still haven't forgiven him- I do have a copy of this now on CD- I had it when it first came out on vinyl & wore it out- It is a great recording! I'll never forgive my brother..."
5,Awesome,I'd forgotten about him until he toured recently. This cd reminded me that he was a great perfomer 30 years ago as well.
5,A True Science Fiction Classic,"It's been said many times, but this is one of the early great books regarding parallel worlds and time. Essential to the history of the genre."
4,CHAZZ MOVES FROM THE BRONX TO YONKERS!,I was able to catch this interesting tale about family ties and gambling on direct TV as part of a sneak peak promotion. Chazz Palminteri proves he isn't a one hit wonder in this well acted character study. The film centers on a crew of pro gambling cheaters and the relationship between a man and his retarded son. What could have been a routine vehicle turns out to be a much deeper story full of insight and many surprises.
2,well written but not compelling,"I have read a number of books by Mantel and admire her writing a great deal. She also writes wonderful book reviews for the London Review of Books. However I put Beyond Black down somewhere before the middle. While the unpleasant characters are portrayed with skill and and some sympathy, they remained essentially uninteresting -- small town psychics with small town ideas. The death of Princess Di thrown in didn't help the mix. I wanted something a little deeper or more exciting to wrap my mind around. However I think it is well worth trying Mantel's other books -- she is in general a skilled and fascinating writer."
5,Beyond great,"Wow. Does anyone else write as well as Hilary Mantel? This book has the creepy power to change the way you look at the world and the half-world. Her ghosts are so evil and banal and freshly drawn, it's as if she has reinvented the afterlife. Amazing book."
2,A tough read,"As an American reader, I found the British dialect, especially that of the cast of characters from the childhood memories, very hard to get through. I kept hoping that there would be something interesting in the story that would make the tough reading worth it, so I hung on until the end but was disappointed. I never felt connected to the characters at all - in fact, they all sort of disgusted me. They were pathetic, not sympathetic characters who had no compassion for each other. I've never read this author before and I won't again. It just wasn't for me."
2,Plot?,"This was my first Hilary Mantel book, i bought it on the strength of the Philip Pullman recommendation on the front cover and he has gone down in my estimation for it, although i should know better than to buy the book on that basis.Entertaining at times, sometimes clever and funny, but overall the book left me feeling pretty empty, there was no real denouement, it just finished and i was left with the feeling ""so what?"".It is much more disappointing when a book has some promise but fails to fulfil it as opposed to being complete trash fiction."
2,Beyond Ennui,"I wanted to like the book as it had a fascinating cover (the hardbound edition) and it seemed like an entoxicating plot. However, it was such work to finish the first three chapters that I started another book, which lead to five new ones. For a first-time Mantel read, I was underwhelmed at the prose in the book. It just didn't pull me in and the novel just seemed to drag. I tried to get through it again and still couldn't make it to the halfway point, so I just let it go. I didn't care about the characters and decided that when you get almost halfway and find yourself working to read a novel for pleasure, it's best to move on and find something you enjoy. Truly, a boring read..."
2,"with so many books out there, read something else","I was really disappointed in this book. I had read a good review of Mantel's work in the NYT book review so I decided to give her a try. I read her memoir first to get a background feel for her work, then I read two works of her ""fiction"". After reading three of her books and really trying to like them I felt bad when I realized that they had all blended together into one insipid, psuedo psychic blur."
4,NEEDS A PROPER RE-RELEASE,"this album came out when the ""crossover"" fad was at its peak (crossover being a mix of american hardcore punk with heavy metal).in my opinion,this is probably THE best example of that ""style"".Doctor Know always had a ""metal"" streak in them anyway in their heavy riffing,this album continues in that direction but with longer more metal-like song structures.if you are a fan already,worth your time.if you are a newby,this would be a great introduction!"
5,It worked for me. Great dog training advice,"I rescued a two-year old Mastiff, who was 190 lbs. He was housebroken but not leash trained at 2 years old. He was very strong and very stubborn, and constantly strove for dominance. He snapped two collars and a leash in the first month I had him.I bought this book before I adopted him. A month after getting him, he took a six-week basic obedience class at PetsMart. I used this book, along with the class, to train him, and three months after I adopted him, he earned his Canine Good Citizen, and two months after that, he was a certified Therapy Dog with Therapy Dogs international.The trainer at PetsMart was mediocre. This book made the difference between a massive, unruly dog and a docile, friendly pet. I highly recommend this book."
3,Canine review,"This book gives an overview of what the ""Canine Good Citizen"" dog training classes entail. This book is not a ""how to"" instead of attending the regular 8 week class."
1,Read the free AKC booklet,"If you're considering the CGC test, you already know pretty much everything in this book. The only thing in this book that is not in every single other training reference I've ever seen is the ""Motivation Method,"" which may be just fine, but when I looked at the references for that method... every one of them is another book by the authors of this book. In short, read the free AKC book and a real training book; this one is a waste of time."
2,Not a lot of content,The notion of drive states is interesting. The description of the particular states is not altogether convincing. Basic criticism: Not much development/content for a book.
2,Beauty vs. Function?,"I've also owned the Bodum double-walled glasses with the same sad result as this Bormioli cup. I had hoped that a different manufacturer would have come up with a better solution. Although the concept of this cup is highly refined, the function of the cup is undermined by the unacceptable fragility of the item. All in all, not worth the price if the cup can't even survive 'white glove' treatment. I have a Jena glass teapot I've owned for more than 20 years, as well as 2 Jena teacups. I don't know what it will take for these manufacturers to determine that concept without function just won't make them money. Learn vicariously from my experience and, DON'T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT."
4,Very stylish and modern looking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just received my cups 1 hour ago and couldn't wait to use them. They were lighter than expected,but should do the job just fine. Isn't it good that they are durable and light-weight at the same time...reminds me of my corelle dinner plates in that way. I enjoy my latte, but it gives me extra pleasure whenI am able to enjoy it in such style. I expect lots of compliments from my guests too.One of the cup's handles did have a chip in it when I opened the box, but Amazon is taking care of it.Of course I don't know how long the cups will last, but I do know they will make me smile with each use.And to me, my smiles are priceless:)"
4,elegance,"I ordered these last winter. Yes, the glass is fragile, as some have complained, but I've yet to break one. They are so elegant and light. You can see your warm beverage through the sides as it steeps or mixes and is quite charming."
4,Beautiful & functional Latte Cups,"I own a super-automatic latte/coffee machine and looked everywhere for glass cups that would fit under the coffee spout. Irish Coffee mugs are just too tall. I've had these 13 oz. Borgioli cups for several months now - using them every day, as well as running them through the diswasher every day. The layers of latte in the cup add to the sensory enjoyment of my morning lattes!! I like that they're lightweight and easy to hold when full. The reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is because the ""seal"" in one of the cups gave out and condensation has built up in the inside of the glass. And, the price is is a bit high but until I find some that cost less - I'm sticking with these!"
5,Must have for coffee drinkers!,Durable and tough although they look fragile. They keep your hot drink hot a lot longer than a regular cup or mug. Overall I am very happy with them
1,Cheap!,These are just as cheap as the the espresso glasses! Read my review for those too if you'd like the full scoop!
1,cheapest glasses ever. Weaker than paper,"These glasses should be classified as health hazards. Simply knocking them on their sides breaks them--leaving sharp glass shards everywhere. One of my glasses also developed condensation between the layers. Save your money and buy some better made ones instead.The other reviewer considers these to be ""manly"" glasses? What??? A Pyrex is manly. This is the flimsiest thing ever. What kind of manly anything breaks when knocked on it's side??? Does your hammer break when it's knocked over? NO... point made."
3,Not made of real glass,"I bought these cups assuming that they were made out of real glass. They are not, they are so light that makes me think that they are made out of plastic (it doesn't say what the material is on the package). They look good overall, and make the cappuccino in it look good too, but when you factor in the price, I think I paid too much for these cups."
2,Very fragile + Not quality glass,"Essentially like other reviewers said, very fragile glasses and cheap quality. 1 out of 4 cups arrived shattered. Returning all of them. Otherwise, they look good but thats about it."
5,These are cool glasses,"The first set I ordered, in April 09, one came broken, I emailed Amazon and they sent me another set, but one was also broken. I took one good one out and sent the two broken ones back, after advising them of what I was going to do. No problem with Amazon. The first time I used one of the glasses I was concerned on how fragile they felt because of the reviews I had read, and guess what, as I was going to the kitchen sink, I was examining it and it popped out of my hands into the sink and broke; not the glasses fault. These are really great glasses, I love them. I already have a set of the 10oz and the 4oz glasses too. You just need to handle them with care!"
1,So fragile I am not going to use them anymore,I saw the other reviews about how fragile these glasses were but I thought I could be extra careful with them. The glass is formed very thin. I fee like I could break it with a flick of a finger. They are so delicate that I have chosen not to use the 2 other classes that came with the 4 pack.
2,"Flimsy, Pretentious, Nonsense","Save your money for something that will actually hold up under a stream of water! Coffee isn't some dainty, pinky out adventure. I want to drink my coffee black, and I want to slam my mug down afterward. Save this for some hippy tea drinker!!"
4,I like These!,"These are clean and attractive, and look very inviting with cappuchino in them. They are relatively sturdy for glass- I use them a lot and put in dishwasher, none broken yet. Good pricing!"
2,Needs some MST3K Seasoning,"This movie by itself is nothing to talk about, but with a little comedy from joel and the bots of mystery science theater 3K it rocks. I can't imagine watching this movie without some form of comedy dialogue, it's just too horrible."
1,THIS ISLAND EARTH,"THE DVD YOU SENT ME WAS NOT PLAYABLE ON MY PROFESSIONAL DVD PLAYERS ,BECAUSE OF THE COPY GUARD LEVEL USED , IT WOULD GO TO A BLUE SCREEN PERIODICLY AND MADE IT INPOSSIBLE TO ENJOY THE MOVIE. I WAS NOT HAPPY. IF YOU INTEND TO REPLACE IT, IT WOULD HAVE TO BEIN A VHS FLORMATE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CURCERN."
2,sci-fi theater,"For a good laugh I recommend the Mystery Science-fiction theater 3000 version of this movie. Other than that I would never watch the original version.Yeah I know, it's so ""mtv generation""."
5,Awesome early Sci-Fi,"I've wanted this to add to my DVD collection for many years. Way ahead of its time when it was produced. A total delight to watch. Very fast delivery, too!"
4,WINNER! Worst Science Ever in a Science Fiction Movie Award!,"O.K., I gave it that award. I love science fiction. I love science. I even love this movie. I have since I was a kid. The movie is still very entertaining, which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars, but I don't think they got more than one or two of the dozen or so scientific concepts anywhere near correct. So buy this movie, enjoy this movie, but please don't think you've learned any science from this movie."
2,Really?,"There are some great science fiction films from the 1950's. The Thing From Another World, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Forbidden Planet, and War of the Worlds come to mind. Guess What? This isn't one of them. Aliens who look like game show host Bob Barker after too much time in a tanning booth, ridiculous looking ""mutants"", and backgrounds on the alien planet that look like they came from a bad high school play do not make for classic science fiction. The science is pretty bad, too. The female scientist states: ""We call the cat neutron because he's so positive."" Then shouldn't he be called proton, instead? Neutrons lack a charge and are therefore, neutral. All the glowing reviews of this movie must be from people taking a trip down memory lane. They certainly don't reflect the actual quality of the movie."
4,This Island Earth DVD: ...,"This is one of those classic 50's Sci Fi movies that you are just itching to add to your collection. The Time Machine, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Forbidden Planet, and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers have all been ported over to DVD format. What is taking so long for this marvelous film to reappear in the mass-market of Sci Fi movies?"
4,Good but Missing Widescreen!,"The movie is everything I remember it to be... Cool story, excellent fx (for it's time) and wonderful production/performances... This is still a definite original in the anals of sci fi...Too bad it didn't come in widescreen... I was very disappointed at that as it misses the complete effect of remembering and enjoying the movie as it was.... I do not like converting films to full screen as it destroys a large part of the director's/cameraman's work! ...and my complaint? I wasn't informed that it was full screen (or at least it wasn't made obvious or clear)..."
2,"It tries, but falls on its face","While definitely better than most movies on MST3k, this one got what it deserved in the movie. There are minor plot holes, like how the bars hold human hands just because they are ""magnetized"". There are also much larger ones, like why the scientists are taken to the alien planet even though they have no Uranium. The lead scientist is just too deep voiced to be believable, especially when he has a knack for breaking things that rivals Inspector Cloussau! See it on the MST3k movie, and you'll have a great time."
2,"Hello, I must be going","Complete with cold war paranoia, this could have been a terrific movie. Feels about 30 minutes short.No sooner do our heroes get to Metaluna(or is that Metallica?)than they leave for home..."
3,"aspect ratio who cares ""get a life""","Who cares if its full screen or wide screen. Want a widescreen, buy a bootleg on Ebay for ten bucks.All this garbage a about the film was years in the making. Its an okay movie, end of story. To all who paid a hundred bucks for it, you must have more money than sense, I,m glad its being re-released, that means you will be able to pick it for five bucks on Amazon by Xmas."
2,"this island earth, abandon ship!","One of the most famous sf films of all time, is also one of the most annoying and over rated. The writing is full of impending malevolence, the acting wooden and direction ordinary. I bought this dvd because I hadn't seen the movie in over 25 years, but it turns out only that I can now see it in colour for the first time. The lack of any extra features is indicative of the entire package."
5,50 years it stands just as strong now as it did in 1957,"This is an outstanding film for any Star Trek buff or anyone who loves the classic Sci-Fi. Not campy at all, Rex Reason and Jeff Morrow steal this movie with good looks and talent. And the leading lady a ravishing brunette filled with talent and they all keep your attention on the screne throughout this great epic. Rex Reason is still very much with us and thank goodness he left this film for his fans for many many years to come."
2,This Island sinks!,"This DVD edition of one of the best sci-fi films of the `50s was a big disappointment. The image quality is not very good--the image is sharp but grainy and the color is somewhat washed out. There are no bonus features at all, not even a movie trailer! Just the standard scene index.A true classic of the genre like this should have been given much better treatment, with commentaries, behind-the-scenes stuff, etc. This disc is only worth being in anybody's collection for completeness. Let's hope somebody does it right next time!"
1,There's a better way to see this movie,"This is an example of how far sci-fi movies have come over the years. It was so cheesy I couldn't help laughing at it. I've discovered I like it much better when I watch it with a friend and some robot companions, Crow and Tom Servo. Watch Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie, and you'll have much more fun."
3,Okay. Just Okay. Okay?,"I am a big fan of Science Fiction movies from this era. So it's hard for me not to fall in love with pictures like this one. But I must be honest. This one is okay, just okay. There is way too much discussion and too little action. The plot makes way too little sense with little real science to back it up. Once the story leaves our planet, the film gets really silly. I first saw this film when I was a kid and that is usually enough for me to feel warm and cuddly about it. But even as a kid, I found it to be no better than okay and more than a little dull. That's too bad because I really like the actors and the production is quite good. But the plot starts out being simple and ends up being insulting. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie unless your Dad took you to see it and in the middle told you for the first time that you were adopted."
3,Looking Good,"This is a really awesome movie to watch especially when you, consider the fact that in the year this movie was made what a challenge they most of had with the special effects. Oh and by the way the proffessor'srole was as always good but short. I was looking for Mary Ann , but to no avail oh well. But overall hands down keeping it real for its time this movie is one you'd want to keep."
4,I love space movies,"This was a pretty good movie, however, I have seen a lot better, they didn't have enough space adventure in it and it was a little boring at the first. The stars in it are not my favorites either, and were not really major stars. I think Exitor had been in a lot of movies, but the rest were third rate actors. I bought it because I had seen it as a child and wanted to add it to my collection. It is not the type of movie you would watch over and over."
3,Campy but fun,"I got this as a gift for someone who feels it is a classic. We watched it together and laughed and laughed. Yet at one time this was state-of-the-art movie-making. Anyway, the product and delivery were both good!"
2,Plot holes you could drive a truck thorugh,"A 50's Sci-Fi classic full of unintended humor. Scientists from another planet deperately need uranium, but instead of taking over some mines in the southwest they recruit earth scientists (to help them do what?) Several weeks are then wasted while they labor on making a triangular TV. When they finally do go to the planet they arrive without a gram of uranium and are accosted by an alien with severe arthritis.And who can forget the cat who's so positive we named him ""neutron."""
3,"Some interesting bits, not a great movie","Aliens need help from Earth so they mail out a parts catalog to likely scientists, the ones smart enough to pick out the right parts to make a mystery device pass the test. Our hero then gets on board a robot plane and is flown to the alien's mansion base on Earth ( nobody seems to realize that the bulging forehead people are in fact aliens). Eventually the hero and a woman scientist get taken to the alien home world which is dying from an enemy attack ( their captors wanted his method for transmuting lead into uranium)where they of course refuse to be slaves. Their alien friend helps them escape back to Earth but dies from his injuries in an explosion soon afterwards. The best thing was the mystery(it's the Alien's) tractor beam that saves Mr. Hero's plane from crashing early in the movie, that & seeing the actor who would later be the professor on Gilligan's Island in a supporting role."
3,Cool Light and sound effects,"I'll be honest. I bought the DVD for three things:1-- The Assembly of the Interocitor (Interociter?) and the sound of it turning on and destroying the assembly plans with its three atomic beams.(Think about it-- a Communications Device equipped with DEATH RAY? Evidently the Metalunans never got annoying dinnertime Tele-sales calls)2-- The sight and sound of the Saucer Launching up into the sky on it's pulsating green beam behind the exploding manor on the hill. Cooooool!3-- The Saucer gliding over the blasted Metalunan surface and then descending down into the crater to the underground city while the spooky theremin score marched over goosebumps.The rest of the movie is standard 50's monster pulp. Entertaining, but not overwhelming. At the same time, this movie defines for me the essence of the scary yet irresistable allure of what we used to call ""Outer Space"".When the Saucer begins taking off Turn Up the SOUND and Take Off with it!"
5,This Island Earth.,What can I say? It's a classic? a Masterpiece? Well for it's time. Yes.And It stands the test of time. Always a pleasure to watch.
3,not a hard sci fi movie,I missed this one when I was growing up.The contrast between this movieand the Anne Francis one is great:Forbidden PlanetThey put in insectoid monsters just for the sensation.The flying saucers here are not very believable either.Faith Domergue is the best part of this movie for me.The heat barrier of hypersonic flight is in the atmosphere not beyondit in outer space. The conversion process for hyperbaric ( high pressure) atmosphereis also pretty trumped up.The only thing believable is the idea of the Interociterbeing based on control neutrino radiation.Still I actually like the movie more than disliked it:some of these 50's movies were just ugly1
2,Cornball!,"This movie is sort of corny and the effects are sub-par, but the story is not bad -- or,at least, it tugs at the right heartstrings. If you've never seen it and you like old Sci-Fi, check it out.Update: Check out the ""kidnapped scientist"" plot as it relates to ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow."""
1,Metaluna we hardly know ye,"Despite a lavish budget (for a sci-fi flick) and despite the fact that it supposedly took a few years to make (or perhaps BECAUSE of it), this film is duller than dirt. I agree with the MST3000 writers who considered it wildly overrated my the Maltin Guide (three stars.... not!) and must disagree with other 'buffs' who have reviewed this for your benefit. Because except for the brief appearances of the Mutant Insect Monster, this flick is a plodding snooze-fest. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE grade B-Z Horror flicks & will happily sit through a LOT of weak dialogue and acting to get a cheap thrill or laugh, but there is simply too darned little of either in this turkey..... for pompous would-be invaders from the stars try The Day The Earth Stood Still for fine cinema, or for cheap thrills/laughs ""It Conquered The World"" instead....."
4,Classic of its time,"I saw this movie amongst several other more recent sci-fi flicks on the same day. It showed how innovative the special-effects were of it's time, and made me realise that people who saw it when it first came out must have been totally awe-struck. Compared to most of todays movies, it seemed very corny at times, but at the same time very enjoyable. A must see for any classic sci-fi buffs!"
5,"This Island Earth, an Epic Swansong of 50's Sci Fi","The cinematography of this film is what makes it a film that stands alone in this genre. The vibrant colors and special effects demand attention. Although This Island Earth lacks the poignant message of films like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" it still manages to convey humanity in a hopeful light in the face of challenge. Most of the alien hierarchy look like Bill Murray with obscenely large foreheads. There are comical errors when the film cuts from grand eloquent sets, to stock footage of a car crash. This film synergistic compiles all the esoteric components of 50's sci-fi. It has amazing effects for the time, a plausible, but familiar, plot which is complimented by the cast. It has amazingly surreal monsters that are greeted by a woman's scream and lamenting alien would be conquered.Great film for film lovers."
5,A cut well above average for 1950s sci-fi,"This classic film is a cerebral sci-fi, although it does have its mandatory special effects. Without spoiling the film by giving too much away, the story starts with a brilliant scientist receiving highly advanced equipment for a project that he is working on. Later, he receives what amounts to an IQ test. Upon solving it, things really start picking up. Good dialogue, plot and characterization, unusual in the 1950s sci-fi flicks, when they used ""universe,"" ""galaxy"" and ""planetary"" interchangeably."
4,"Good, Melodic Hip-Hop","I picked up a promo copy of the Evil Tambourines CD in a used record store and was surprised by how solid the album is. For fans of melodic hip-hop with lots of sounds and horns going on, this album is for you (especially if you like acts like the Boogiemonsters or Dream Warriors). The best tracks are ""Pathways"" and ""Saturn"". This is a very underrated album from an up-and-coming alternative rap group."
1,Porcini Is More Like It,"This music video scores well on a one out of three rating: It is beautiful since it is filmed through the mists at Torre del Lago,Puccini's area of residence, but the video sings flat due to awfulacting, while juxtaposing itself into rehearsls by the amateurishScottish Opera, and the story itself is a bad soap opera. If youwant to see and hear ""Turandot,"" find Franco Corelli's video version,and if you want a better presentation of Puccini's rusticmarital problems with his wife Elvira, read the book--skip this mess.Ciao,"
1,Puccini was so much more,"I was very disappointed in this movie. There was no level on which it was satisfying. I kept feeling they should not have bothered. Puccini's work is a favorite genre for me and this tale was just so tawdry and boring! I have been to Italy and the places he lived, especially Torre del Lago which has so much joy and warmth attached to it....at least for me. I had to make a big effort to stick with this film to the end. Now I used the tape to record over it. There is nothing to endear this to anyone."
2,"Dracula for Dinner, or am I an Appetizer ?","My favorite Holidays are Christmas and Holloween. I always throw a Bash on these days.Finding ideals or recipes related to All Hollows eve. Unlike for christmas,Are hard to find. I enjoyed the books easy to read format.Bits of Vampire Lore. The Buffet Ideals and decorateing Tips Were up my alley. Thow its tounge and cheek, Or fang and blood. The recipes are advanced,ingredients in my area hard to find localy.If your not comfortable in the kitchen, this book would be a forbiding bite.On the other Fang if you collect, or are a Vampire fan this book is a good Bat."
3,Not like in Italy,"I originally had this cured beef in Italy and I wanted to duplicate the dish. This beef was ""mustier"" and thicker sliced and I didn't like it as much. Also, the ice packs that were with the beef were TOTALLY melted and the beef was not kept cool. I was actually a little leary about eating it."
5,THE DILLINGER DOSSIER,"The book arrived in excellent condition. I had owned this book before and wanted a second copy. Anyone who is interested in John Dillinger and/or the bank robbers, kidnappers and thieves of 1930s America should read this book. Additionally, anyone who is interested in conspiracies or the power of the FBI should read it as well."
5,Jay Robert Nash,".... is a phenomenal researcher. In ""Dillinger: Dead or Alive?"" he clearly states his own skepticism, and delves deeper and deeper ....If nothing else seemed factual - and I mean NOTHING else - the eye color cinched it for me. Mr. Nash was banging against every wall imaginable to have ever written his original ""D:DOA?"" - I credit him as a genius.Steve"
3,Mixed,"I bought the book based on the reviews, and had a mixed reaction. The writing was tedious and redundant - very much formulaic. The illustrations were not helpful, and many were, frankly, very similar to each other. ""Curled"" and ""Curly"" seem a difference in perspective, rather than a substantial difference in shape. The picture on page 433 was of questionable taste. ""Location: 4-"" was underrepresented, and I fear that this might reflect some undercurrent of professional dislike between the authors and this location. On a brighter side, the l(3) section was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise plodding morass of l(1), l(2), and l(4). ""tufts"" had me laughing out-loud, but such pithy writing was rare. I enjoyed the two-column format that pervaded the book, and would buy the next book in the series on that merit alone."
1,Propaganda from a paid hack!,"There is a good compendium in here aboutwhat 'they' want to do TO us, not for usand that we should be greatful for. Whois this guy Hutton to suggest that ourgreat Constitution is outdated and needsto be scrapped? A paid lackee for theRockefellers, I think the way his lousybook reads. Hey Hutton, YOU GO BACK TOEurope if it's sich a Utopia, you Socialist!"
4,YoY,"As an author myself, I recommend that you purchase this book for personal study. As a member of the Earth Charter, ""A Declaration of Interdependence"" is a very grand envisioning realization of the way to make things right. Although he focuses mainly on economics, I still find this book of high interest.Author. ""Knowledge For Tomorrow"" Quinton D. Crawford"
5,WHAT A SURPRISE!,"Listening to this album is a true surprise. This is a masterpiece in the field of not only Cuban music, but also in the field of popular music in general. This is one of the most brilliant albums of this group, not only because electric sound is boldly and creatively used, but also the rhythm itself, which is given a new name gSongo86h, has become more complex and more addictive than several preceding works of them. At the intros of the songs, each instrument that belongs to the rhythm section such as the bass, the synthesizer, the drums and the percussions, begins to play one after another in order not to let us know the groove thoroughly. As a result of this, one gets a thrill listening to the intros and get excited when s/he listens to the rhythms of various instruments altogether."
2,"re-issue of ""Bad girl""","This album is the same as ""Bad Girl"", just another name & cover picture: The ballad ""Someday"" shows that La Toya vocally can do well. The production is weak. The songs are ok. It's dancey pop."
3,good budget title,"the graphics are ok. it plays alot like killswitch engage where you can blindfire at enemies then peek around to be more accurate. the levels are kind of bland as well are the colors. the weapons you achieve are pretty cool since you play through two storylines at the same time, switching off from a rambo kill everyone guy to a stealthy sniper solid snake dude that has stealth camo (which is one of the coolest parts of the game). the freefall/skydive missions are origional (which is another plus) where you have to shoot other enemies out of the air flipping around dodging bullets, while avoiding anti-aircraft rockets. the explosions have neat wave effects too! the controls are solid except the vehicles, and the aiming could use a little bit of work.. overall you will enjoy this game hence it is definitly worth the current market price."
1,Save your money,"The fact that the sunglasses came much sooner than expected means nothing considering the quality of them. I unfortunately failed to read the reviews so purchasing these sunglasses was a mistake on my part, but the second I took them out of their case the right lens popped out and the frame was disconnected. I definitely agree with the other reviews that these are costume quality glasses and definitely not worth the price."
2,What do you expect at this price,These are cheap sunglasses. Fine for a costume but I couldn't imagine wearing these for any period of time. Not very high on the quality chart
2,plastic fantastic,"HUGE lenses, and they're made of plastic. But for the price? Tough to beat for a one time use (costume)."
1,not a fan,I Heart BB products but this shampoo + conditioner line is awful. The shampoo does not lather well at all which makes you overuse the product and the conditioner is very very light not moisturizing like it implies. I used this set for about 2 weeks and my hair looked and felt awful. I switched back to the gentle line + Coco line and my hair was happy again. Just not for me. I have very thick hair and this did nothing for it but make it flat/limp/frizzy.
2,Not worth it,"I puchased both this and the matching conditioner. After two bottles of each, my hair started to feel heavy -- like I hand't rinsed it adequately, even though I know I had. I cancelled my auto ship order after two times."
1,not real,Item was not the same as original store bought I had last time. I returned item but be aware it may be opened or counterfeit.
3,no sudsing action,"smells good, and has made my hair shiny, but you need to use so much of it, or it just kind of vanishes into the hair. not sure it's a great value for the price. Probably won't buy again."
1,CWW,Have used this product for years...What I received from vendor was in correct bottle but either was not the correct product or had turned bad and changed colors...Not at all satisfied...
1,Beware: Fake Product!,"I agree with the previous reviewer. If this was the real thing, I would have commented on its quality but this is surely counterfeit. The liquid inside is orange and nothing like the real thing at all!"
1,Bottle collector beware!,"Don't buy this book. It is a waist of money and time. I have a lot of old bottles and can't find one of them in this book. It says it is the best book for bottle collectors. If it is, why can't I find even a Vicks Vapo Rub cobalt bottle in it?? I am very dissatisfied."
2,I would not recommend,"The begining of this book has lots of useful information including digging and diving for bottles. However, I was disappointed with the amount of pictures. The descriptions for most bottles were vague. I rated it a 2 because of the extensive listing of Jim Beam bottles. If you collect Jim Beam this would be a worthwhile book."
4,Bottle Collecting,Excellent resource with good photos in color! Antique Trader is always a good purchase decision.
3,Bottles Unmentioned,"Actually I have read this book,but I have questions on the bottles I did not seem to find in there. Is there any way to give info. on bottles over the Web and recieve the information back? I have a number of bottles I am unsure of and dont really have the time to go searhing for this info elsewhere. Any information regarding this would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Trudy Gordon"
5,antique bottles,"what a great company you have,a section of books on almost every subject.you make it easy to know if you really want that book or not from the page and reviews of others.easy to pay for,and your people in shipping are very good at their jobs. the books are boxed to keep from getting damaged in the mail.the thing i liked mostly is how easy it was to order and how fast i received my orders.your a 5 star company and all your people do a wonderful job."
4,I;ll yake the whole bottle please.,It;s a good book for the money. It could be more detailed in some areas but over all it's a good book to have in your library. I would have wanted more examples of differant types of bottles but all in all worth buying.
2,Pretty but of limited use,"This book has some nice pictures, but much of the written information is simply wrong. For example, the discussion of how to determine an age of a bottle is seriously flawed. The author talks about how to dig up privies, but the info. on how to locate them is feeble and largely fanciful. Good luck buying a Sanborn map! Many of the prices given, too, are out of whack with reality---either way to high or way too low. Far too much space---about half the book!---is devoted to Jim Beam bottles and Avon bottles, which are of little or no interest to traditional bottle collectors. Put that stuff in a separate book! Meanwhile, the bottle YOU want to look up is almost invariably missing. Hopeless. But yes, some pretty pictures."
1,TERRIBLE...Many Many Mistakes makes book almost wothless,"I know bottles...I dig them and I sell them at all the bottle shows in NY,NJ,PA,CT area. I am a professional and am very knowlegable on bottle collecting and appraisals of all kinds. DON'T be fooled by the fancy pictures and the fact it is endorced by Antique Trader. They trusted that he knew what he was talking about when they printed 15,000 copies. They were wrong!THERE ARE SO MANY MISTAKEs IN THIS BOOK ON IDENTIFICATION AND PRICING THAT ANYONE IN THE BOTTLE COLLECTING SELLING BUSINESS WILL NOT BUY THE BOOK. I spoke with the author at a recent bottle show where he was selling his book and he refused to acknowlege his own blatent and foolist mistakes through the ENTIRE BOOK which is down right embarassing if you ask me. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Very Cool.,"This one is better than most of the books in its category, although by far is not one of those ""most complete guides"". Good writing style, Real life examples. Type of camera, film and exposure settings are listed next most of the example pictures. What this book has that others don't, is a pretty good overview of digital input and output(especially printers and scanners), and how it's related to ""film"" photography. Highly recommended for beginners."
3,Good for new photographers. Old stuff,"I was hoping to get some inspirational ideas from this book, but was disappointed. Copyrighted in 1989 it is pretty much outdated. When it comes to digital photography using today's technology this book shows its age. However, if you are new to photography, this book covers all the bases of what to think about when you go out to shoot. I kind of got the impression the author was not a huge fan of digital photography and preferred film. Twelve years ago, he had a lot of company."
4,Freud in China,"What happens when a Chinese psychologist from France decides to gp to mainland China to practice Freudian therapy. Funny and striking story about a culture clash: because there is no such a thing as psychotherapy in China up today.Now I want to read Trois vies Chinois, just published"
3,Slow Moving Plot,"I really enjoyed the first part of this book: a little action, some interesting background, characters introduced and the stage set. Then you grind into what seems like page after page of an excruciatingly slowly developing plot, albeit with bits of excitement here and there along the way. The writing style, large number of characters and numerous subplots make it a not too easy read, as you try to keep it all straight. Ultimately, the characters don't develop much depth and the plot gets so strung out that the book becomes more of a challenge to finish than something fun to read. I gave up in the middle of the book and moved on to something more worth my time."
2,Slow read,I kept waiting for the action and it never happened. It was like reading a diary of a not very interesting person until the very end of the book where the hero finally did something himself.
1,Very tedious reading,This is the first book that I have read by W.E.B. Griffin and it will be the last. Very tedious reading ... I kept waiting for the action and it never happened. It was not worth the price of the book nor the time it took to read it.
5,Another Griffin,Griffin never fails to keep your interest. This one was a little different. Still one of the best authors in this field.
2,Just toooo long...,"For starters, this book is 750 pages long, which is not a bad thing by itself. I have read many novels which are similarly sized. But the dialogs, on secure phone lines, are never ending. Every ten pages, the major needs to get on a secure line to talk to someone. Which brings me to my major gripe about the book: the real reason for which the murder takes place, is not revealed till - hold your breath and wait for it - PAGE 556!!! That's right, you actually have to wade through 555 pages of dialog until the plot advances. Good luck finishing the book."
4,A long but easy read.......,"It is a long and sometime drawn out story, but it does show the inter workings of the different departments of the ""sneek and peek"" part of our Government.The in-fighting and non-sharing of info/intel goes on everyday and it continues.I enjoy books that take you around the World, as right now that is where the war on terror is being fought.My only problem with this book was that, we had a big long build up and a really fast end to everything.But that has not stopped me from already buying the next in the story line.Enjoy......"
4,Looking for a needle in a haystack.,Another Griffin hero in the making with a Special Forces Major. Castillo has all the potential to be an absolute winner. This book is a good start. It has a good plot which moves around Europe and the USA. I like the piece about the Special Forces medic. It is absolutely true that they are the equivalent of excellent surgeons without the qualifications! It has a good cast which will improve like a good whisky (Famous Grouse?)with age. It is a very plausible plot.The Hostage
2,"Rivetting, kept me up at night","Tough act to follow, the action in this one is fast paced, and Mr Castillo, ( who desperately needs to come to terms with the fact that he's rich), as ever the real McCoy when it comes to following orders; with class; and most of all with a sense of humour, god knows that's important. I would have liked a bit more in relation to Castillo and his grandmother, I know the ground was set in the first installment but still that relationship is important and can give Castillo food for thought. W.E.B Griffin has hit gold with Castillo and friends, keep up the action, and I can only wait to see where Mr Griffin takes Major Castillo next."
3,Good but not great,"I enjoyed this second installment of the Presidential Agent series, but I have to say that it could have been much better. In the first 3/4 of the book the author follows his tried and true formula and puts down a good story, but in the last quarter it seemed as if all of a sudden the author decided he had to finish the book in a hurry. The dramatic ending you are expecting never quite materializes and the lots of details are dropped at the end. Yet, while the ending was disappointing it was still an enjoyable read. Go for it if you are a W.E.B. fan."
3,Below average for WEB Griffin,"Always anxious for the next novel, I pay the price for the hardcover, rather than wait for the used or paperback. However, this one was a disappointment--too much bureaucratic documentation and infighting--not enough sex and violence."
4,The Hostage,"Typical Griffin. His latest character is still being developed in this, the second of the series. Good reading and enjoyable as ever.But, what about McCoy and those guys? What about our Army Friends, Craig Lowell? It seems that those guys could have had an interesting time with world events."
1,He finally is back!,"After a series of almost boring books, Ol' WEB is back! This book is truly in the best Griffi tradition. I won't bore you with what happens, go buy the book if you want to know. What I am saying is that he finally has caught his old rhythm again and is writing books that one can enjoy.Yes, there were a few thin spots (the unnecessary trip to Budapest, for instance) but the rest is pure WEB.A book worth buying and keeping as part of your own private library.PS: Did you really pee in the Yalu river way back when? And is that a Cuban cigar????"
4,A real suspender snapper.....,"As a public librarian I've handled almost every Griffin book published though I've never read one. For some reason, the cover, the author's rep, the advance publicity for the Hostage...who knows, I grabbed this book when it arrived at the library and read it. What a pleasant experience. There are more plot twists and surprises in the Hostage than a roller coaster has dips and turns.Charles Castillo who works for the Department of Homeland Security and is a personal troubleshooter for the President is assigned to look into the death of an American diplomat in Argentina. In fact, the husband was shot in the head, and the wife taken hostage by terrorists who believe her brother has information related to the U. N./Iraq oil for food scandal.Economically written with interesting characters and a timely, right off the front page story, Hostage will keep you in suspense. Grab this book if you get the chance."
1,The Hostage by W.E.B. Griffin,I have read and enjoyed the other Griffin books and felt this one was not nearly as good as the others. The plot was not believable and the ending was very weak.
1,Who's the Hostage?,"This is my first Griffin book and I'm underwhelmed, especially when this guy is supposed to be the ""Tacitus"" of this generation. Hardly.Mild story barely worthy of a TV movie, with little excitement and thin characters, connect the dots plot points, and -- even after all of these shortcomings -- no climax. Griffin scores a few brownie points for entertaining me with what I'm willing to accept is some well researched ""information"", but come on, that does not a good novel make.Ask yourself this if you still decide to read this book: Was anyone even taken hostage in the story?"
4,Chief of Mission,"I have read every Griffin book and enjoyed everyone, including ""The Hostage."" But I see indications that the author may be relying on others to write his dialogue. At the least, he is receiving inaccurate research information. To wit, a United States ambassador IS the Chief of Mission in any foreign country. This book would lead you to believe there are differences. Not so. I hope that enough feedback is being provided to Griffin to make him a bit more discrete in using the information provided by his researchers."
1,Just Writ As Fast As You Can...,"Simply horrible and 750 pages long. Almost no plot, characters that are much the same as all of the other Griffin books. It is amazing that this kind of drivel sells."
4,Pretty damn good,This is the first book of WEB Griffin's that I read. It won't be the last.It's a lengthy 465 page read with a lot of detail but very interesting. I especially liked the parts in italics where your seeing what Castillo is thinking to himself as he talks with others.You'll find yourself getting deeply involved in the plot and the characters and there are quite a few people to keep straight including two named Alex.You can imagine yourself with these people in these places and that makes this book more than a worthwhile read.
2,Not a Great Read,"This is the first book that I have read by W.E.B. Griffin and most likely the last.The paperback publisher guaranteed that this book was a great read or your money back. Well, it was not a great read and the money back offer is too much hassle.The hero of the book, Charley Castillo, is an heir to a billion dollar publishing empire in Europe and a billion dollar conglomerate in Texas and his occupation is a Major in the US Army. That's just too far fetched.I also thought that the book was too long and bloated. For example, several pages are devoted to Castillo whining about having to check his luggage on a commercial flight because there's not enough bin space. Give me a break.It seems like the book just drones on and on and then the climax is disappointing. In fact there is no real climax. It's like Griffin is saving it for his next book."
4,The Hostage,"Up to Griffin's usual high standard. Excellent and well researched local atmospheres. One feels at home in his description of Buenos Aires and Budapest. However, the ending is a bit letdown."
1,Not Griffin's standard!,"Very tedious reading and Griffin seemed in a hurry to end this long and boring tale as if he himself was tired of it. Being a long time fan of Griffin (since ""The Lieutenants"") I was very dissapointed in this novel. (Sorry Mr Butterworth)"
3,Formulaic & Tiring,"This is another formulaic and tiring tale by Mr. Griffin. He is a very talented writer who is stuck in a serious rut. Most of his novels have such a sameness to them that makes them tedious to read as the years go by. For example, it seems each series brings us a young and well educated hero (in this case Charley Castillo) who shows unbeleiveable bravery and daring for someone so young; who is chasing a beautiful, intelligent and well endowed woman for whom his libido gets him in trouble; who is protected from the results of his personal immaturity by someone in power (in this case the President); and who is independently wealthy, but serves his country and does his duty because he is a patriot. Okay, all these things might make for an interesting character in a couple of novels. But, come on Mr. Griffin, make your heroes more diverse. Give them some varying personality traits from series to series. Make me want to read your novels again!"
4,No title,This was an older remastered recording but was still very listenable. I particularly like Matt Monroe--prefer him to any other male snger of his era.
1,BUYER BEWARE! MONO ISSUE OF WHAT SHOULD BE STEREO,This CD reissue is really a piece of junk. These two albums were issued on vinyl in beautiful wide stereo. The CD is mastered from mono master tapes. There is no excuse for this. Buy at your own risk.
3,Dubious about the translation,"I note some have criticized the translation. I searched ""little lion"" in the book and saw how ""O Leozinho"" was translated: I have to agree it's pretty weak. If you're going to read a book in which a songwriter explores the thoughts behind his songs, wouldn't it be nice if the translation reflected what he wrote a bit more closely? ""Drawing my gaze like a magnet"" becomes ""You're a captivating sight""; ""My heart is the sun, father of every color, when it makes gold his skin in his loafing"" becomes ""When the sunlight lights on you, color floods into my heart."" So if you care for insight into Caetano Veloso's poetic way of speaking in his songs, the book seems to fail on that."
2,first the music,"I believe good musicians should do music first and last. I own all of caetano's cds and I really appreciate his music, but I found this book a bit too apologetic and pretentious at times. It must be because I wasn't born at those times, so I cannot know how it was to live under a military dictatorship; yet I simply can't understand why you have to explain all those details inherent to one song (sem leno, sem documento). The writer is definitely better as a musicians, so, buy one or ten of his cds first."
2,I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE EXCHANGED THESE,One of the salt and pepper shakers doesn't sit completely flat. My husband got the plug to sink in enough that I kept them when I should have exchanged them. It will probably always be a problem. I do like the looks of them though.
5,Great Blades,"Bought the clippers and several size blades to clip my dogs for the first time.Easy to use, simple to change blades are wonderful, and the dogs look pretty darn good for my first effort. This 40 blade works great to get a close cut on their feet."
2,dull blade,"The blade looked fine however, when I put it in my clippers it seemed dull it wouldnt hardly go through my dogs hair at all and they are Shih-tzu's so it should it's not like they have tough hair or something .. not very happy with blade"
1,Maybe i just got a bad blade,"It seems to do a good job at blending between the 2 blade and the 3 1/2 blade but i can never finish because its the only blade that I have that customers constantly complain about feeling like it pulls and yanks hair.Maybe i got a defective blade.But,I keep it oiled and cleaned.It strted pulling hair from day one."
5,Great product,Purchased as an additional blade. Cuts great gave a real professional cut. Molly looked like she just got back from the groomer
5,PERFECT,As a professional and busy groomer I was amazed at the incredible price I paid for these blades. These blades were brand new and in their original package. They were shipped super quick and were packaged perfectly. The seller even added a bonus blade for me to try!
5,Great trimmer,"This blade works perfect on my Oster 76 clipper. I'm not aware of a blade that Oster makes that gets this close, so I was happy this andis blade worked."
3,Do not use with the metal attachment combs!,"Even though the metal attachment combs say to use #30 blade, DO NOT DO IT! Use a #10 or #15! The combs seem to break the teeth off the 30 so easily. I've had TWO 30s busted because of using them under attachment combs, but the 10s never break under the combs.The 30 is great for doing 'clean face/poodle face' but be very very careful around lips! It will knick lips easily. Otherwise I'm not sure what this blade is for. I get by without it now. I do my poodle faces with 10s. much safer of course"
5,Great Seller!,The seller was great. The order came very quickly and as promised. Would definitely do business with again!
5,Good vendor,I have used tis item for a long time but it was my first with this vendor and the experience and service was great.Thank you
1,"Buy Oster Blades, these are not a good quality option","These blades got rusted in 2 months from purchase, I live in Panama the climate is pretty humid...Previously I have used Oster blades without hassle...these ones are not really worth the try."
1,unsatisfied,Im a barber and use the blade every day. The blade is so sharp that it hurts the customers. It can even prick into the skin if pushed hard. Dont recommend to any other stylist.
5,Just what I was looking for,"I wanted a little more fur left after the colder weather groomings, so this was just what I was looking for. This product was also offered at the best price, including shipping."
1,It didn't fit,"The Andis company told me this was the one for me. But theirs was too expensive so i bought it from you. It did not fit my shaver. There was nothing we could do to get it to fit and actually shave the dog. Too sad. So, I'm sure it works fine on the right machine."
5,Awesome!--Easy to install!,"The blade replacement is just what my clippers needed! It was not difficult to switch the blades out, and it's as if my three-year-old clippers are brand new again! Thank you!"
2,sman,"The drum sounds are good, but this is just a toy. It dosen't work with garage band without crashing and it can only be programed to simple meters."
1,Do not buy this product,"This piece of software doesn't function properly at all.It doesn't work with Apple Logic, contrary to what is advertised.It was written by an amateur programmer, and crashes very often - about 1 out of 2 kits that you open will quit unexpectedly.For a software drum machine to contain mostly live and acoustic drum samples doesn't make much sense since software is mostly used for electronic music. No trance, or electronic samples at all.All that for over 50 dollars makes idrum way overpriced.Also the graphics were stolen from Garageband.A program like that should be freeware, or at the very most shareware."
1,Not worth it.,I recently bought an iMAC and was excited to use garageband. I needed a drum machine so I bought this program this program in the apple store. Within minutes of use I realized this is complete garbage. If you are looking to make rock beats with this just turn the other way and start walking. This program is meant for soldier boy or some other artist who utilizes fake sounds into repetitious beats.
3,It's OK,"I bought this item because its finish matched the color of other items in my kitchen. I was aware when I bought it, that it wouldn't be the highest quality ""copper"" item that I could purchase. So in that respect I guess I got what I paid for. I noted some little rough spots in the finish on the base, but, in its favor, the base is a firm, solid one. The bunch of grapes that is supposed to be the top looks more like a pinecone. But that's not to say it looks bad. And, finally, the paper towels are held firmly, and tear off with no problem (no wobbles or too many coming off, things like that...) The roll of towels cover up most of the little imperfections I noticed in the finish on the base.So, that being said, despite some relatively minor appearance issues this is a decent paper towel holder."
2,Pages Separating From Binding,"After reading good reviews of this book by Author William R. Stanek, I purchased a copy from Amazon. From what I've read so far, the information contained within seems great. My problem is with the actual pages separating from the binding. As I'm reading up on the subject of Group Policy on page 95, the pages were coming apart from the binding. After reading some reviews of other Microsoft Press books on Amazon, I noticed this seems to be a common problem. How can this be a reference to use over and over again if the pages are falling out. Any chance of getting a new copy that remains together after turning a few pages?"
4,Great book...needs an eBook included.,I have many of the Pocket Consultants. Great reference books to have in the office by the servers. NEEDS TO INCLUDE eBOOK VERSION.
4,Good for system Admin,Well done book. Easy to understand for System Admin. Most of information you need to do your job.
4,Win Svr Adm Guide - mrp,I bought the book as a reference book and it has been able to provide me with easy to find and accurate answers each time I had to refer to it
5,Must-have information for any Windows admin,"Stanek has done a great job of addressing new Windows admins, longtime Windows admins, and Windows converts. He covers networking, print services, Active Directory, DNS, and more. In each section, he covers the basics as well as the nitty-gritty details (with lots of useful tips along the way). He does a great job of explaining user accounts and permissions, including permission problems and how to correct them. I read the first few chapters in detail, skimmed the rest, and now refer to the book whenever I have questions or problems. I've yet to run into any daily Windows administration tasks that wasn't covered in this book."
3,Good as far as it goes,"The many 5 star reviews this book has received are based on it being well written and handy. But way too many things are left out. Shell commands (which are far more extensive in Windows Server 2003) are mostly ignored and advanced features such as network load balancing, message queuing, clustering, etc. (all of which are free once you purchase the OS) aren't covered at all.I'd recommend Tulloch's Nutshell book from O'Reilly over this. The coverage of shell commands is much better and Tulloch assumes you don't need to be told every little detail about how to navigate the UI."
4,You will not be disappointed!!,This book was given to me by a friend and I must say I was not disappointed. The Protector is a intense story about a woman who trying to protect her niece from from child abuse. The book is both touching and intriguing. I found myself booing the bad guys and cheering the hero and heroine on. I can't wait for the next book by author.
4,The Protector,Well written--good plot. Very entertaining with a slight cliffhanger. It has a few hilarious moments as well as covering a very serious subject impacting our society today.
4,A thoroughly enjoyable book!,"From the very begining the book hooked me and I couldn't put it down. The storyline flows well and the plot is great with a few surprises toward the end. The book kept me guessing and it definitely made me laugh. The only problem I did have was there are a few typos in the book, but it doesn't take away from the story. I certainly recommend this book if you're looking enjoyable book to read."
2,The Protector,I thought I was going to like the book but at one point the story line started towards a husband possibly drugging his wife to have relations with her and I just didn't want to follow that story line.
2,Gingrich? God?,I have to agree with the reviewer who couldn't stomach Gingrich talking about God while he so callously walked away from his wife undergoing cancer treatment.Americans just can't seem to get beneath the surface of anything or anyone...Just talk about how God fearing you are and you're in!
1,DVD won't play,"I would love to see this video. However, when I put the DVD into my player it comes up with a message which reads 'player can not read this kind of disk', whatever that means. My family regularly rents and creates our own dvd videos and have enjoyed watching movies with this player for the three or four years since it has been new. I would hope the supplier of this product will get back to me and please send a unit that can be watched."
1,Can't stomach it,"I am a conservative, but can't stomach a book about ""discovering God"" from a couple who forgot the ""thou shalt not commit adultery"" part of the ten commandments. Maybe they need to stay home and discover some personal ethics before they go on a their next book tour telling others about it. Ick."
2,Not Great,I think Newt has his head screwed on right but this video left me dry. It was boring and I never watched it a second time. I guess I can't define what I was looking for but this DVD didn't do the trick.
5,All Americans NEED to view this Video!,"A beautifully presented walking tour of Wash. DC, this DVD is a must see for all Americans. It shows how strongly our founding fathers, and those who served our nation after them, felt the need for the Lord's help in the conduct of government and of society, as well as in their families. I recommend it highly. If you haven't seen them, I'd also recommend David Barton's video ""America's Godly Heritage""; the Columbia TriStar video ""1776""; the DVD ""A More Perfect Union"" from nccs.net (officially recognized by the Commission on the Bicentennial of the US Constitution);and from American Vision, an audio CD ""America: The Untold Story"" and the thick book ""The Christian Life and Character of the Civil Institutions of the United States"" by B.F.Morris. These all tie together and provide a wonderful understanding of the way life should be - and was until the Supreme Court decision that threw prayer out of our schools and our lives into the toilet."
4,Great find!,"I had the first volume since college and was happy to find the companion, Vol. 2.The book was received in great condition.Thank you."
1,only rec'd drivers side,"When received only got drivers side assembly, no passenger side. Sent item back for refund."
5,OMG hot as he** looks,"these headlight look so hot, they really dressed up my 96 chevy. just buy them you will not be sorry."
5,"Gorgeous boots, very sophisticated","I've been looking all over for short boots to match my suede jacket, and here they are! : ) These are perfect to pair with jeans. I probably could pair them with leggings & a skirt too, but haven't tried that yet."
5,Quite Revealing,"Ties together many diverse aspects of history, religion, and events into a logical and related common thread. Makes sense of seemingly unrelated happenings that are plausible based on his theories. Good book."
2,Difficult Read,I am having a hard time reading this book because it is not straight forward. There are some interesting key points. I don't doubt the authors statements just that the book is boring.
3,Conan Doyle From the Outside,"Daniel Stashower's biography of Conan Doyle is well written, as one would expect from the author of the Houdini mysteries, but never profound. We are given the great man's public life without any deep examination of the inner man. The result is a rather straightforward narrative, interesting because Conan Doyle led a fascinating life, but with all the weight of a magazine profile. The complete absence of citations reinforces this impression, and there are no footnotes, although a comprehensive bibliography is included."
5,Tackles one of the great Conan Doyle mysteries.,"How could Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the great reasoning detective Sherlock Holmes, have allowed himself to become the dupe of mystics, mediums and mesmerists? Daniel Stashower has tackled a topic ignored or passed off by previous biographers, and he has so in masterful fashion. By examining all of Conan Doyle's life, and pulling together much of the recent scholarship which has been scattered among journals and comparatively outre books, Stashower has brought us our most comprehensive view of the multi-faceted created of Holmes, Prof. Challenger, Sir Nigel and much more. But most of all, he has done a exemplary job of putting Conan Doyle's spiritualistic evanglicalism into perspective. This is an entertaining and thought-provoking life storyArthur Conan Doyle would have loved it!"
5,Couldn't put it down,"A fascinating page-turner of a biography with revealing new insights into the author of one of the world's best known characters. It brings into focus the man behind Holmes, one who most people recognize but know very little of his fascination with the spirit world and its influence on his writing. It is well written, highly engaging, and well worth reading."
2,Hacked,"Po's story about the world of investing kept me entertained. The characters are engaging and the prose, although not jumping off the page, is good. Bombardiers is readable, there's just one problem: Catch 22's been done already. This novel is a complete hack from motif right down to the loopy dialogue. pass."
4,Praise from a Fellow Writer of a Finance Novel,"Po Bronson's book is a clever satirization of life on a bond sales desk. Having been on a trading floor, I found that the antics and brutally competitive environment depicted by Bronson were wonderfully authentic. Bronson also does a great job in explaining esoteric market concepts well. I know the challenge of accomplishing that from writing my work on the finance world: ""Imposters at the Gate: A Novel about Private Equity"". The uproarious humor and ease of use of language make it a great read!"
1,Pathetically awful,"Po must have been a very stupid bond trader, because only a loser could write such a terribly dull book"
3,poor mans catch-22,"mr bronson certainly does a good job in finding bizarre elements of the bond industry, and stretching them to ludicrous levels.the securitization of a third world country iscertainly memorable , but i feel that he owes mostof his laughs to joe heller,and the constant catch-22-like characters and situations which he creates.for lisa lisa read major major!"
2,Amusing but Derivative,"It's an entertaining read, but as an earlier reviewer noted, Catch-22 has been written already. A good beach read, but don't look to this one for insight into the world of finance. Joseph Heller can rest quiet in his grave!"
1,z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z,"Having done time on vintage-1980s/early 1990s bond trading floors, and in light of the many positive reviews posted here, I expected to love this book. I don't. I'm halfway through and I'm not sure I summon up the willpower to go further. I guess I'm bored with the style; way too many ""essays"" about bond sales and way too little plot.How the heck does Igino sell RTC bonds to accounts on credit hold? (Is this plot point picked up in the latter part of the book? Like I said, I'm not sure I'm interested enough to read on and find out.)""Liar's Poker"" and ""Fiasco"" are perfectly capable of amusing, exposing and outraging audiences without resorting to abject nonsense. Those non-fiction narratives deliver what Bronson promises. Perhpas it's beause the latter works were written by authors who've been there and know first hand."
2,"A weak entry in the ""i-bankers are evil"" category","Bronson comes across as an expert in derivatives, deriving most of his book from ""Catch-22."" I was really disappointed in this book; ""Liar's Poker"" is much better and I suspect more people would enjoy it. Of the two books combined, though, there is exactly one noble character--Michael Lewis. See you on the Street."
3,Toss up between 3 and 4,"There's something odd about the way it is edited, so it's disappointing technically. But still, I read it straight thru, thoroughly entertained by the characters. Again, Bronson's dialogue is excellent, in my opinion. I laughed out loud, too."
4,The catch 22 of the information economy,"""It was an information economy, and its fundamental flaw was that information didn't have to be true to be sold. ... The economy continued to flourish, but it would have crashed if there had been a simple requirement that it be based on the truth. ... Every third worker in the information economy was a salesman of one sort or another. The economy hinged on the success in selling the next new thing.""Po Bronson writes the 'Catch 22' novel of the bond market. His style will not appeal to everyone, and I found I prefer Bronson's non fiction. Indeed, he sometimes seems to change scene in mid paragraph.But the book is profound and, more important, funny."
5,"Funny, Hilariuos, Hysterical!",I thought this was a great book. It had me laughing real hard and almost to the point of tears. It's Catch-22-ness made it a fun read.
3,Funny characters bland ending,"This book has some wonderfully funny characters similar to the zanies found in Catch 22. However, if you're not in the financial industry you can get lost. I felt that the story got too far fetched down the stretch and ended weakly"
1,1 star for longevity. 5 for scent,"10 stars for the great scent but doesnt last more than 5 minutes!the scent itself as a storm of cinnamon prelude followed by port wine, leather, and sensational basenote of tobacco.too bad longevity is close to none."
3,Don't Waste Your Money,"I should have listened to the other reviewers.It definitely does not have the longevity I once remembered with this fragrance. Either Burberry has changed the formula or this is a cheap, 'watered downed' version of the scent I loved (I'm guessing the latter). Do yourself - and others - a favor by coughing up the extra $20-30 and buy this at a department store and get a bottle that will last the entire day with just a spray or two."
5,Great scent at a great price!,I purchased this after doing some research for something new to wear to work this winter. Smells great! My wife loves it too.
2,Just a bit off...,"This is my second time purchasing this, the first time was from a department store and the second time was from Amazon. For some reason, this one seems a bit less potent, doesn't last as long, and seems a bit higher on the alcohol side. It just overall misses the mark. It's a great scent but the quality seems to be a bit lower. I'd give the old department store version 4 stars but the amazon one underwhelms at 2 stars."
4,Great Winter Scent,"This is a great winter scent that goes as well at the office as it does on the dancefloor. Very pine forward and it stays with you nicely for the day.For a more summer flavor, check out Burberry's Brit. I do this in the fall and winter and Brit in the spring and summer."
2,"Miss....and, Hit? (2.5 stars)","Right out of the bottle, all i smell is BLACK PEPPER. I swear. Might as well go to your kitchen and pop open your basic jar of ground pepper because that's what it smells like. I actually regretted buying it at first. HOWEVER, once it dries, it actually smells quite pleasant. But the overall scent gets VERY faint, so I'm thinking it's not going to last more than a couple hours. You'd have to spray quite a bit on you. I only did one spray because the initial scent is SO overpowering. I guess I'll have to deal with it to get to the nice smell that follows minutes after. Overall, it's ok, but not as good as Burberry Brit, that one is amazing. If you're into fresh or citrusy scents, this one's not for you. TRY before you buy, i can't stress that enough with Burberry London."
1,Bogus & Bootleg Cologne. This is a Steal not a Deal. The Customer is Robbed!,"BUYER BEWARE!GIVE YOUR MONEY TO CHARITY OR BURN IT FIRST, but don't give it to this crook. This product is cheap for a reason. IT'S NOT THE REAL THING..I know I've owned and used the real thing for about a year prior to this rip-off.I thought I was saving a few bucks with this merchant, INSTEAD I LOST EVERY DOLLAR ON THIS PRODUCT. Maybe I should have been suspect when the label was lopsided on the cologne bottle, the cap doesn't fit snug on the bottle (like the real thing), and this product reaks of ALCOHOL (like cheap or imitation cologne).GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND PAY A FEW DOLLARS MORE. DON'T BE A FOOL LIKE I WAS.DON'T SHOP WITH THIS MERCHANT......unless you like being ripped off and have nothing better to do with your time or money.IF YOU WANT A MAJOR DISSAPPOINTMENT....shop with this merchant."
5,Outstanding,"I think this is one of the most wonderful scents a man can wear for himself. As the scent wears on through the day different aromas come forth and smell amazing. I find it funny when people say they can't smell it after a few hours, and that's typical with any type of cologne...you become use to the smell and don't realize it's part of you. So try a sample at your local dept. store and see if you like it, then if you are amazed like I was, then this is the best place to buy. I love Amazon and there prices!!!"
3,Burberry london,"I recieved item on time, sealed in box when I opened the box I found the bottle was leaking a tiny bit.Makes me feel like the item might have been tampered with, possibly watered down."
1,Fake Burberry London - watered down?,"I now know why this product is less expensive than that found in department stores. I have used this product for several years and know the potentcy should be stronger than that in the product I received from Amazon. This cologne is much much weaker and almost no fragrance within a few hours. I truly feel that this is watered down and will not buy again. Usually I have great satisfactiion with product purchased from Amazon but his product is inferior and not the real thing.Bob LepperSpringstead, Wi"
5,I found it!,"This is a favorite of mine and I am so glad I found it on Amazon. The men's version of Burberry London is no longer sold within the Burberry line, so I took a chance and searched for it here. They have it and it is a great price. Relief!"
5,Great cologne for an even better price!,My husband LOVES this cologne & it's hard to find in stores these days. Glad to have found it here! Arrived promptly & was exactly what we wanted. Thanks!
4,Burberry London By Burberry For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4-Ounce,"I purchased the 3.4 Oz Bottle, and received it in the mail a few days later. It smells weaker than it did when I tested it in the store, but smells great otherwise. Hoping that was just an isolated problem. Definitely buy! But be careful to get the real thing. It's a sortof fruity sophisticated smell."
5,"Unique, long-lasting, fall winter fragrance from Burberry","Burberry seems to have a very unique set of fragrances for men on the market. Unlike many other popular designers, they have a whopping total of 8 different scents available: Classic, London, Beat, Touch, Brit, Sport, Weekend, and Summer. I have 5 of these, and have smelled all except the Summer. They are all excellent scents that bring their own unique appeal. For the London, its spiciness and woodiness brings to mind the fall/winter season. For me, it lasts about 6 hours. The bottle is cool in that the sleeve that covers it is a cloth material."
3,The smell is ok,The smells is ok it really smells more sugary then I expected. I know a few cheaper colognes that give out the same smell.
2,Fake,"Not the real thing, the fragrance is similar, pleasant enough, but projection and longevity are abysmal, wears off after an hour... Far from the real thing and the authentic one will last HOURS and project out. Really disappointed in Amazon, buy in a fragrance outlet instead if you want the real deal."
3,Smells OK,It's hard to rate cologne. I'm not really a big fan of the smell (kind of musty/sandalwood-ey) but it does last long and the packaging is nice.
2,Not the best of Williamson's work,"I have read several books by PW and liked them all. She is masterful when it comes to create tensions between her hero and heroine. She also has a beautiful and poetic way of telling a story. But Keeper of the Dream is not her best. PW's book is usually very emotional but sometimes she over did it, which is the case with Keeper of the Dream. I agree with the ""bipolar"" comments from one of the reviewers. And I found myself very very tired going through one misunderstanding after another between the H/h. For a while the story seemed going nowhere. PW is at her best when she tones down a bit - try The Outsider and A Wild Yearning, both of which are absolutely breathtaking."
1,repetitive and boring...,I have bought this book because I tend to believe the reviews of my fellows readers... I can say that I have been very disappointed in it. There is no real chemistry between the characters... I felt very uncomfortable with some love scene... bordering non-consenting...
4,Excellent story,"This story is about a wounded hero. He was abused and neglected as a child. He comes to conquer a castle in the hopes that it will be the home that he has always dreamed of. The heroine hates the hero, since he conquered her home and killed her brother. This story takes you through the years of this couple. A fantasy of a story, told with real-like human emotion, tragedy and happiness."
5,Fascinating Biography,"It is my great pleasure to let Amazon readers know about the exploits of Alexandra David-Neel, the explorer of Tibet, which the Fosters chronicle so vividly in the biography, THE SECRET LIVES OF ALEXANDRA DAVID-NEEL. This bio reads more like a novel or adventure tale due to the wonderfully-detailed scenes with such authentic touches I felt as if I were truly there, and often worried about David-Neel's ability to survive. Obviously the Fosters have done their research incredibly well and write graceful,lucid prose; I was captivated from the first sentence and actually resented having to put down the book to take care of chores. This is is one of the best biographies I have ever read. The story cries out to be told visually on the big screen."
5,Wisdom and beauty.,"I've read this book many times since the '70's. It disappeared for a while and after loaning and giving away my books I n found myself without a copy until this new edition came along. The text is the same, but the cover and pics are different.The words whisper things that my inner self already knows, but needs to remember.One can meditate on the words, or the wonderful black and white photos.Each page includes the ancient Chinese script of the text."
5,Kylene Beers and Kate Kinsella,"Burke's done it again. . . . He's handed teachers a book that not only inspires but enlightens. English/language arts teachers for all grades will want this book. . . . I have only one wish for this book--I wish I had been the one to write it. --Kylene Beers, Editor, Into Focus: Understanding and Creating Middle School ReadersJim Burke has succeeded in crafting an immensely engaging and considerate resource for teachers who are committed to demystifying reading in their fields of study for young, developing learners. I am thrilled to find this wealth of research-based and classroom-tested interdisciplinary strategies, compilied by a dynamic and experienced literacy mentor for fellow classroom teachers. --Kate Kinsella, Reading Specialist and professor at San Francisco State University"
5,Superior Organization,"I've been using Reading Reminders all summer to plan my sophomore reading class strategies next year. I love the organization of this book. Links to related sections are easy to find. Burke gives wonderful examples of so many worthwhile lesson ideas, like dense questioning, making connections, and repeated reading. There are dozens more. I can hardly wait to give my students the reading survey and to run off all the graphic organizers in the appendix!As a 16-year teacher, I am often disapointed by workshops on reading that are really aimed at the elementary grades and ""retrofitted"" for high schoolers. This book is a high school teacher's dream."
2,Good for college students?,"I found that this book is a general introduction to what a reading teacher does. It is very inclusive, but since I already had the general background, I didn't find that suggestions like, discuss a character's motivation, to be particularly helpful. I was looking for a springboard to lesson plans. I would rather have had a skinny book with just a few specific workable ideas I could have brought into my classroom. In other words, this book covers a lot of ground, but without much depth. I am giving it two stars because I think it would be helpful for a college student who may need to demonstrate knowledge of general teaching techniques."
2,Pale Imitation,I interviewed Zelazny once and am a huge fan of his work. But I could not force myself to finish this deadly dull novel after getting half way through it. Korda (a universe builder) is a pale imitation of Zelazny's much more interesting Francis Sandow (a terraformer who reforms planets). Korda's overly cute banter with his robot assistant Jester makes the book childish instead of (like To Die in Italbar and other Zelazny novels) engaging and compelling.
5,This is the one to get,"If you are looking for the definitive version of this book, the must have out of all editions, this is the one. This edition has the scans of the actual text, and the Faulkner translation below (and yes I perfer Faulkner to Budge). The artwork on the actual text itself is beautiful, and not to be missed."
5,Awesome!!,"I ordered this book as a birthday present for my partner, he has always wanted a copy of the book of the dead, he was absolutly thrilled with it. He loves the fold outs of the scrolls and having the english translation as well, and i was very thrilled at how quickly it was delivered and the quaility of the book, this was the first time i have ordered anything online and i will definatly be doing it again. ( we live in New Zealand and the book was delivered in 3 days!!!!!! thats fast)"
3,Gospel concert.,"I am not happy with this record. I had hoped that there would be some beautiful music (I love Rita Coolidge's voice) with unusual rhythyms like the stuff I have heard from Robbie Robertson. The voices here are excellent, but most of the selections sound like gospel music. I bought a concert CD because I thought it would give me a broad selection of Walela's music. If they are 90+% gospel-like tunes, their CDs won't contain enough of the stuff I want to hear for me to buy them. However, if you like gospel-style music, my three stars would become your five."
4,Live in Dallas,"I saw this concert during the taping. This Dvd reflects the concert very well. the picture quality was jerky in some spots. this may have been a defect in my copy.Laura Satterfield's voice is something to be cherished and a wonderful insturment.The only thing missing in the Dvd that was shown live in the concert, was that of Laura trying to keep her breasts from popping out of her blouse during the entire show. that was a treasure!"
1,Reprint of 1917 out of copyright book,This is an expensive reproduction of an early version of Gregg Speed Studies. Ignore the '2004' publication date it is actually copyrighted 1917. Since I was hoping for a post Simplified speed studies I was disappointed. Unless you want an expensive reprint you are almost certainly better off buying a second hand third edition.
5,Fabulous Product,My hair is very thin and this product adds fullness without weighing it down or being sticky. I wish I had discovered it sooner!
1,Goopy and tore at my hair,I've used this product for sometime and bought directly from B&B - I can't live without it. For my fine hair it makes it managable and extremely easy comb right out of the shower. To refresh my stock I ordered from Amazon Prime and I've used the bottle two times so far just in case I was wrong. It hardly sprays and is very thick compared to the usual product. It practicaly makes my hair impossible to comb and gluey. Downright gross. Something is definitely wrong with this stock.
4,Results: Soft & Tangle Free,"Initially, I didn't buy this product - I ""borrowed"" it from my mother who has extremely fine, stick-straight hair. My hair is the complete opposite - thick, curly and tangled. This product leaves my hair super soft and tangle-free. My hairdresser even noticed a difference in my hair texture. Needless to say, but I'm a big fan!"
5,Good detangler,"I have long curly hair, this is a good detangler which also preps your hair for product."
4,Useful but not a miracle,"The product description says the product is intended to detangle hair prior to prep. I never have tangles anyway as my hair is very short. this product was recommended to me by a stylist for another reason: Something to give me a little stylng power but without goopiness or smelliness.It works fairly well for that.Positives: There is a light odor when you spray it on but after that it disappates and does not linger on my hair. It is imperceptible as a styling product ie. it looks natural. It doesn't feel icky or goopy.Negatives: It provides just a little bit of ability to style my hair, but nothing like the power of using a really goopy product. It doesn't give my hair (which is dull) any extra shine.Overall I think this is a fine product if you have the right expectation. The product description says it removes tangles. It's also useful as kind of like a styling product ""lite"" and to be used when you don't want a heavy product in your hair."
1,buy at the store..seriously.,"I got this at the hair salon and loved it. For some reason the one i ordered on amazon smelled like paint. read the same review online, should have listened."
2,Can't figure it out,"I purchased this with the thickening spray (see my other review on that!) as it advertised like a light conditioner for fine hair that does not need heavy, weighty conditioner. I also was lured that it could be used the day after you wash your hair to prep it up a bit. It really doesn't do anything but become somewhat gummy. Wasted $$$$$ again!"
1,Defective,"I've gone through two bottles of B&B Prep and love it. Unfortunately, this bottle is not a clear spray liquid as it supposed to be but a thick viscous substance that will not even pour out of the bottle, much less spray. I did not try to use it until a couple of weeks after the return period had expired. But there is a quality control problem somewhere. I have never had this happen with a product before."
2,"Many drops, poor setup","Router has good range, but far too many drop connections for me. Everything interferes with the signal. Went back to my Microsoft MN-700, which performs way better than this."
1,"1 step forward, 50 steps back. Just horrible.","This router had 1/4th the range of my standard linksys G-router which suddenly burned out after less then a year. The speed (when I could get a signal) was 1 to 11 Mbps, my old router held a steady 54Mbps. I did need a range expander for my old one to cover my whole house, but I couldn't use it with this router. The expander only works with the basic G-router, so no way to even boost the signal on this new one. Support was a joke, couldn't get any help or explaination as to why the ""Expanded Range"" was so much less range the the previous ""unexpanded range"" Bought another older version, and everything's great again. Don't waste your money or time on this."
2,Great when it works...,"I had this router connected to a 2-in-1 cable modem-router that I got from my ISP. Essentially, I used it to create a subnetwork within my home. The problem I experienced with this router was that no matter what configuration settings I played with, I couldn't get it to transmit all of my 20Mbps to my devices. My previous WRT54G had no problems routing the entirety of my bandwidth through it, but for some reason this router did."
2,"Easy setup, ugly, poor wireless","I bought this to replace a netgear product I had had for quite some time. I have not been overly impressed by the range on this thing, but most of all I found, like the netgear, that far too often, I need to do a long powercycle just to get the wireless back online!Pros:- very easy to set up with a lot of optionsCons:- ugly- power cycle required to kickstart wireless once in awhileStandard amount of powers (4) I wish they would make these with 6."
3,Set-up was not flawless,"Setting up this router was not as flawless as advertised. First of all, installing the software that came with the unit was a complete waste of time. I was not able to get a connection without calling a LinkSys Technician. Till this day it shows up twice in my network connections. Once as the network it defined itself as, when downloading the software it came with, and again as the network defined when assisted by the Technician. In addition, I haven't been able to get a very strong connection no matter where I place the unit. Eventhough it nows works acceptably, I am not entirely satisfied as I still don't fully understand this unit. It looks good, but I would have preferred to be able to relate and understand this product a little more."
2,suddenly stops working,I managed to set up wireless no problem but then a few weeks later it stopped working. I managed to get it started again only for it to fail again. I'm somewhat disappointed.
2,Very Disappointing!,"Despite the slick marketing effort (i.e. ""With SRX""), this product falls short.The installation disk is useless.Customer support was good, when I could get through - which was not very often.I constantly lost the wireless connection.I constantly had to re-boot.Despite significant effort (utilizing the online help features) I could never obtain a secure, encrypted connection.No more Linksys for me!"
5,Linksys WRT54GX-G Broadband Router with SRX,"Received item promptly! Had some initail trouble installing on new Windows Vista computer system, but as always Linksys' phone support was superb! Expect unit to perform admirably as others have in the past. DWH"
4,Speed and reach great. Period.,"For the speed alone, I have to give this router four stars. It's awesome. A wireless with true wired feeling. Beyond that, though, it's still a bit rocky. On my unit, uPnP refuses to work consistently, if at all. At times, it's very sensitive to changes, and just won't save them. I've really had to coax it into Static IP mode. Speed though, it's great. The unit will do for now. Though, I can't believe it's produced by the same ""company that runs the Internet."" A bit of a scary thought."
2,Poor Physical Design,"While the router looks nice, the vertical design makes it quite unstable and is susceptable to falling, especially with cables hanging from it.Version 1 antennae are cheap, brittle, and easily broken. Look for Version 2 on the model number sticker. Version 2 has replacable antennae.Router works well, but is overpriced."
5,Great Router,"This is a great router. This is the very first one I ever bought and I am very pleased with it. I never set up a router before but setting this one up was a piece of cake. The router did come with a manual but I didn't even have to use it because it actually autoconfigured itself. All I had to do was set up the wireless security on my own. I send pics, flics, and photos (not to mention play online) to my new XBOX 360 several rooms away and it all downloads as though I was sitting at the actual desktop. If you are looking for a great router this is the one."
1,VPN Does Not Work On This Router,"If you need to VPN to your office, forget this router. VPN service does not work as of firmware version 2.00.08. Spent 20 hours so far on the phone with tech support and a quick search in google will show I'm not the only person having this trouble."
3,Difficult installation for a great router,"I do not feel this product is plug-n-play. Installation took almost 8 hours. The following are my thoughts on the Linksys SRX Router:- difficult to install- limited documentation available- the installation wizard on the CD was not specific enough for successful installation- online help was terrible (the individual helping me did not have a good grasp of the English language)- installation required resetting and/or unplugging my cable modem many times- installation was finally completed via a utility websiteOnce installed, the router worked great. I would have given the router 5 stars if the router was easier to install."
3,Do not buy if you have a Mac!,Be warned you can only administrate and setup this router if you have a Windows Computer!
1,No support ..,"1. expect to spend at least 1 hr setting up2. Support calls are routed to India3. Item has no instructions included in packaging4. No support number listed with contentsIts obvious they do not want you to contact there support and I am always amazed at products that do not include written instructionsproduct is a hit an miss, returned this for a similar NETGEAR router and it worked great with a easy set up too."
4,Works well but a bit complicated to setup with the security feature,"It took me several tries to get it to work with the encryption on. I contacted Cisco and they helped a great deal. I used their web chat and they sent me the content of the 2 conversations I had with them directly to my e-mail address. Setting up the router with the CD is horrible, my password kept being rejected. I used the IP address and my browser, took no time after that."
4,"Rare vintage death metal singles, finally on CD","Volume 3 in the Relapse Singles Series once again brings together a handful of rare singles (previously only available on vinyl) on CD for the first time around. This volume includes the following singles:Rottrevore: Copulation of the Virtuous and Vicious (4 songs, 1991 release)Repulsion: Excruitiation (2 songs, 1991 release)Monstrosity: Burden of Evil (2 songs, 1991 release)Incantation: Deliverance of Horrific Prophecies (2 songs, 1991 release)This is all very brutal death metal from a classic era in that genre, and aside from this collection most of these songs won't be found on CD. If you're a serious fan of any/all of these bands, or just the old school death metal sound in general, this whole series is a must-have."
4,COOL and creamy GOODNESS,"WoW, who wouldent love this mix for extra creamy and thick milkshakes or add coffee and it a latte or frappe ! I love the milkshakes, add milk and ice and blend to an amazing flavorful milkshake that is just the best ! My son loves it with cold leftover coffee, and ice a touch of milk, and he has cut some of the calories and has a 'guilt free' dessert and loves it soooo much. Family fun for everyone!"
4,Hilarious and Insightful,"I found this book randomly in my local library, and being fascinated by the film industry I decided to give it a go. So glad I did. Clever and colorful, this book details the logistics and lunacy of aspiring filmakers running the gauntlet that is Cannes. I was inspired and touched by the subjects, awed and entertained by their tenacity and turmoil, and laughing throughout. A great read for anyone even remotely interested in the movie biz."
4,Here come The Heroes: Very Enjoyable !,"Very enjoyable !I usually don't take a chance on small indie. bands, but I kept hearing about ""Lunch Box Heroes"" through friends of mine that have seen them live or knew of them from festivals and industry showcases. I ordered the CD and I was very pleased with the vibe and sound. This CD is enhanced and has pictures, video footage and lots of cool stuff to check out. I'm glad I took a chance on ""Lunch Box Heroes"". I'm looking forward to their show with Bruce Springsteen in Philly, PA."
4,Tons of strong features & just one weakness,"I've had this product for about 6 months now & love it although the layout of the plug-in might be a little confusing at first. The presets are a strong feature, a few dozen to choose from that you can very simply scroll through, pick the one you want & play. A major weak point in my book lies in the fact that when inserting the plug-in on a track, it takes a longer time than normal for it to load up so it's evident that this piece of software is pretty taxing on the computer's processor & not too efficient, even for one that is has a lot of RAM. Other than that, it has amazing distortion settings for guitar or anything else you want to add distortion or character to with tweakable parameters. Much less expensive than some other guitar distort plug-ins & a no-brainer for Pro Tools LE users."
5,One of the Best Albums Ever,"Please get this album. You will like it.While not as well known as Wire's debut, Pink Flag, this album, in my opinion, is much better. Wire's increasing use of synths really helps the music as well as adding yet another experimental quality to it.Also, if you plan to get any wire album, why not get all three of their essential albums:Pink Flag (1977), Chairs Missing (1978), 154 (1979)"
2,"Well, I thought it was a great reel.","Well, this looks nothing like the review I wrote at the time I bought the reel. I used to be a big penn fan, but now I'm sticking with shimano or maybe even branching out and trying some other brands. This reel is not all that smooth and doesn't really cast that well for the price. It's probably comparable to most $30-50 reels at best in my mind. The rest of the price is for the name, which it seems has become the selling point of these reels over the actual quality. The screw that holds the bail on this reel broke in half and the reel is basically worthless to me now unless I can find a way to get the broken off part out and feel like spending $5-10 on a new screw from Penn. Already bought a $30 shimano to get me by for the time being and I'm not sure it wasn't at least an even trade. Disappointing product to carry the Penn name."
4,Great slippers,"Very comfortable slippers, great cushioning which I love because I am on my feet all day. I put them on as soon as I get home at the end of the day! They machine wash well and are durable. I have worn out at least 3 pairs, and the only regret I have about them is that the cushioning doesn't last longer."
5,"As usual, they are perfect.","I go through a pair of these about once a year. They are so soft and warm and hold up great. After about a year of being worn daily, the padding on the bottom starts to break down, but that is to be expected after that long. I highly recommend these."
1,Dearfoams women argyle pile slippers,Product: Dearfoams Womens argyle pile slippers: Cost = $20.00.Purchased for gift. Daughter put on and there was a hole inside. Already threw out box and other paper items so I could not return.Very disappointed.
5,dearfoams,they are great and warm my second pair. i washed my other pair every week and wore everyday all day long
1,Platform Houseshoes??,Being taller isn't necessary in houseshoes! They also run a little smaller than my normal shoe size.
5,durable comfort,"i love these slippers. 5 years ago i received my first pair as a gift and im still wearing them currently. every 2 weeks or so i throw them in the wash, making sure to tumble dry thoroughly. the sole shows very little wear; the thick cushion is like stepping onto a cloud, it forms to your foot and fluffs up again after washing. i bought an imitation pair, and they were flat and tearing within a year. so i bought my second pair of dearfoams, which live up to all my expectations. i never knew such quality, comfort, and longevity was availible in a slipper. i am passionate about dearfoam. (they are roomy, so go smaller if you are borderline)."
5,"Good Stuff, Cheap, On Time","Got this as a present for my lady - she loves them. Fit well, comfortable, look nice and the price was right"
3,More notable for the author's influence than the actual work itself,"This is a fine novel. It is not outstanding, but it is not bad, either.Fine, however, is typically not what readers look for in a novel. The fact is that this is a simple adventure story that lacks the narrative greatness of Tolstoy, the impeccable structuring of Turgenev, or the psychological insights of Dostoevsky. What makes this more important, as a novel, is that it is a highly-accessible way to read Pushkin. Why might you want to do that, you might ask? Well, if you are ever planning on reading any of the later Russian greats, you will hear Pushkin's name very often. In some ways, I think it is safe to say that Pushkin's importance to the Russian novel is analogous to Dickens' importance to the English novel.One thing it is important to note: This novel was never finished. While the novel has somewhat of a climax, those of you wanting a traditional denouement should look elsewhere."
3,This is a strange one...,"I'm a big Nazareth fan but had never heard of this release until I just stumbled onto it up here.According to the artwork this was released back in 2004, on the ""Reality"" label. I think it is a ""grey area"" release, taken from radio broadcasts (?).Disc one is the music CD and according to the liner notes is taken from the Glasgow Apollo plus some tracks from ""San Houston Colleseum Texas"" (note the misspellings), both from 1981. Disc two is an interview from 1997 (?).I've not listened to the interview disc yet, but despite its flaws the music disc is worth having. Sound quality is very good, but some of the songs have rough cuts or fade out in weird ways - for example the song ""I Want To (Do Everything for You)"" (which is listed as ""Do Everything"" on the artwork) cuts out before it really even starts - only about 50 seconds long!!!"
5,Nice thick cookbook..,Recieved in great shape even tho former library book. Lots of nice recipes & so far excellant tasting & great for berries. Even my husband liked the berry dish but had way too much sugar in it so cut back over half on the sugar to let the natural sweetness of the berries to come thru & turned out great. Didn't last long at all...
3,Ok net for the price; Flimsy feel,"The net I received had a split in the pole where the net head attaches. So the net actually bobs up and down a little if I shake the pole, like it's going to fall apart. I may have to reinforce the pole end with duct tape or something. Otherwise, the net works ok for removing dead leaves and floating plants from my fish pond in preparing for the winter. I don't feel I can scoop up a full load of wet leaves because of its flimsy feel right now. I'm afraid of telescoping it because the net head feels like it will break off. So I do a little at a time."
1,Broke in a month,This is poorly made. The net came apart at the pole within a month after I purchased. I recommend you look for another product.
4,Nice pond net.,"Nice telescoping handle, decent sized net. Perfect for small to medium sized pond fish but not for the really large koi. Works well as a back up net."
3,Story of SWEET young love....,"I read this book about 3 years ago. For whatever reason, this is the only Kerouac book i've read so far (people tend to read On the Road first, or maybe Dharma Bums). I liked it a lot, it is a very sweet story about the relationship of two teenagers. But being a female teenager when i read it (i'm 22 now), it was a little hard for me to relate. I think a teenage boy would enjoy this a lot more than I did. There was a lot of good dialog... and parts of the plot (sports, friends, family)other than the relationship that were enjoyable too.Overall, I would consider this a good read."
3,un-Kerouac,"Not one of Kerouac's best. In fact, it has a strange, not quite Kerouac feel to it. Not that it is bad, by any means. I just suspect that if it had been written by anyone other than the auteur of On The Road, it would be Out Of Print."
3,Flawed Edition,"I certainly agree with the other about the quality and insight this book passes on from Fr. Lewis as a young monk. His works had me toying with the idea of joining the Trappists myself but I never quite made the step.The reason for the low rating is the abysmal quality of the text. There are literally hundreds of errors in it. It seems that they scanned the book but made no editorial check after doing so. Many ""y""s come over as ""v""s. Merton quotes Latin phrases at will and it is hard enough to remember how to translate them without the text garbling it all up with meaningless lumps of letters. It's a disaster!"
3,Where's Mongolia? -My Review,"""Where's Mongolia?"" is museum-like in content... many stills, live action, facts, and glimpses into the amazing arts of the Mongolian people. (Dancing, Wrestling, Archery, Fashion, and Craftsmanship) It also includes information about the endangered species and dinosaur fossils found in Mongolia, which (in my opinion) fit uncomfortably into the theme of the video. However, it was very informative. I was somewhat disappointed that it hardly showed footage of Mongolia itself, as much of the video is centered around the Mongolian sports festival of Nadaam as celebrated in New York City in 2000. The video also includes some American museums' displays of various aspects of Mongolia's rich culture. Having been to Mongolia myself a few times, I believe that ""Where's Mongolia?"" is an informative, honest, and factual presentation. It gives a good glimpse into Mongolian arts. I enjoyed it."
5,Hot,"Super recording; especially her version of ""You Never Love the Same Way Twice"" -- nice mix and one that you don't get tired of listening too."
4,Best album - but what happened to the extended version?,This is easily Elvis' best album up till this time. But what happened to the extended version that was issued a few years ago? That one included the other six songs that were recorded during the same sessions.
5,More Elvis,"I'm an Elvis fan and this CD contains a couple of original songs by Elvis. I've played it so much already, I'm in danger of wearing it out."
4,Great Rock,Great choice of Elvis music. Brought back memories of the older songs. There were a few songs I hadn't heard before. Glad I decided to buy.
5,ELVIS IS BACK,"I had the original vinyl album (guess that dates me!) but this is just as grest as the original. The collection also combines ""Something For Everyboday"" (got that original, too!)along with 5 bonus tracks. It would be impossible to pick outany one song to say it's the best. Elvis sings with feeling, sexuality and you can can tell he was enjoying every minute of it! A must fo every Elvis fan and a ""must try"" for those of you who only know ""Hound Dog"" & his early standards. Listen to this & you'll experience the beautiful God given voice & talent that is truly Elvis Presley!"
4,Five stars for the music,"Worst liner notes ever. I mean ""sagaciously""? ""The vinyl equivalent of film noir""? ""The Clovers released their penultimate single....""? The writer must have had a bet on how many times he would use the word ""whilst"" in his essay. The most jumbled and nonsensical liner notes ever.I wouldn't be so critical, but this CD is being marketed at a historical recording. How about historical liner notes that make sense.The recordings themselves sound awesome and are worth the price of admission. Lots of great photos as well."
1,Mediocrity,This is the most mediocore collection of Preley songs that I have ever heard. If you are very interested in what was at the bottom of Elivis's recording barrel then this is the album for you.
5,Elvis is BACK!,Elvis is Back (Legacy Edition) is the best sounding recording of the album I've heard to date. The remaster sounds wonderful especially when played on a high quality sound system. 2 CDs contain lots of great songs from the early 60's and some of the best underrated songs of Elvis's career. The album contains a big booklet with lots of color photos and information pertaining to the recording of Elvis is Back! Check this out you will not be disappointed. I would also recommend the other legacy edition Elvis albums for they all sounds amazing.
3,Plastic lid did not fit,"I actually bought a set of 2 CorningWare dishes with lids and plastic covers. Unfortunately, the plastic covers were too small for both of the dishes. With a lot of effort - we were able to get one of the lids to fit, but there is no hope with the other one. It's unfortunate, because I thought the lids would come in handy for storing leftovers. Aside from the problem with the plastic lids - Corningware has continued to provide good quality dishware."
1,Made in China Means Something,"I have old set of these 16 oz dishes with the vented covers. LOVE EM! I bought these to suppliment the set despite not having the vented lids. Not only aren't the lids interchangable, but the lids with this set does not even fit right. Some too tight, others flimsy lose. hmmmmm. First set, made in the USA and the new ones China.I will pay better attention in the future. I will buy American or do without. They'll get the message one day."
3,Storage Bowls,"I bought these at my husband's request. The bowls work well but the tops can be hard to get on and then really hard to take off. One of them is too loose. I had previously purchased these many years ago and the tops worked very well with the bowls. Still, they are very useful."
2,"Made in China, lost American jobs","Good little dishes for the money. I have an older one that split,so be careful. China has a long history of making ceramics, so I don't mind buying ceramics from them, but this was an American company that moved it's operations to China and laid off American workers. I will try in future to try to buy MADE IN AMERICA products."
3,"Decent, but oldschool","This video would be great if it was not 25 years old. That may be an exaggeration, but you can get an idea of what its like just based on the cover photo. Still waiting for a decent Australia travel video. Rick Steve where you at?"
3,Decent,"I'm not sure what I expected when I played this album for the first time. What I heard was abrupt, half-realized song ideas and some atonal jams. Maybe that was the whole point and I just missed it entirely. However, I think Chairs Missing is the better Wire album."
3,an o.k. punk album,"This is a somewhat generic punk album. It's not bad but it's nothing to rave about. I'm sure when it came out in the seventies it sounded more daring and cutting edge but the music hasn't aged as well as that of the Ramones, the Clash, or Television."
2,early work so different,"This early, early, EARLY album of Halestorm is so radically different in sound, theme, & quality as per the other songs & albums I've heard from them. Admittedly, I'm a late-comer to Halestorm. I have only recently heard about them & am enjoying their music. So I am more acquainted with their newer work before I found this album. The vocal work sounds earnest, but strained. Not sure if it's b/c Liz Hale's voice hasn't matured yet or whatever vocal training she received after this has definitely made her for the better."
3,Halestorm update,"This particular cd is going to be hard to find since the band got signed to Atlantic records and went for the more common modern rock sound. The band has grown and released a few discs after this ( and only one before it). Should the band make it to the successful level, expect these releases to be extremely expensive and sought after."
3,Salt Lake City,"I don't like this cd it does have lynch on it. And doc is changing his sound, it's not is tough. It sound like he is trying to get poupler"
1,setripnsuxstyle,"I rember a time when gansters got wacked for being traders!thiz album iz az weak az it getz,the intro sounds like itz ganna be hard but thatz about all thatz hard about thiz album,No lynch make doc ah weak azz,i will never buy another doc cd az long az i live,But dont just take my word fo it,if your a real lynch hung fan make your own judgement..."
4,Bombay,This is a pretty tight Cd. I like doc's style better on Setripn Bloccstyle but this Cd's way more laid back and he's doing his own thing with odysea now away from lynch and the rest of the siccmade family. It's tight but I like his bloccstyle flo a lot better.
4,above average sactown cd,"This was a alright cd by mr. doctor. Tracks 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 17 had stright lyrics and hard beats and the rest of the cd was ok except for tracks 8 and 11."
1,season of da SuCCnEss,"dis cd is weak...i thought it wus fonna be tight. but i guess DOC aint goin no where wid out da reel sicc rapper,DA LYNCH HUNG, yeah he is da reel siccmade of dis whole blackmarketrec. I'll never buy his new album ani more if dis rapper'z arent in them= X~RaIdEd,BrOtHa LyNcH, SiCx ect."
5,"nice watch, excelente price and great performance","I got this watch and I am very happy with it!! It is scratch-proof!!!! only a diamond can scratch-it!!!!! Take care of the bracelet...it is easy-to-scratch because is made of stainless steel. I recommend you wash it every week because it stores dirt and grease on the back!!! Nice product!!!!! It has the same features of a more expensive watch as Omega, TagHeuer...at a very nice price!....one more thing...it has an alarm that is not noise, so it will not wake you up in the morning."
2,Band broke after one week,"The band of this watch failed in less than a week of lightweight use. I contacted Victorinox and was told that the band was not covered by the warranty. I expected higher quality of manufacture, and for the product to be fully backed up by the warranty."
1,Materials and Processes Book,"Book was late arriving. In ""good"" condition, other than the fact that numerous pages were ripped out. All pages there, but no easy to use book with these loose pages"
5,Love it!,"When we bought our house we had a problem where the previous owner took a crystal chandelier out of the living room- which sucked but whatever. We decided to go for a more practical fan in the living room to circulate air and provide light and went with this Hunter fan. I guess that's a lot of backstory to just tell you that we are in love with this fan. The installation was relatively easy, except none of the guys could get a good angle on the last screw. Still, it's a great fan, really sturdy, has a nice glass light that produces a ton of light for the room. (Before the old owner had the chandelier and also two other lamps to light up the room- this fan provides as much light on its own and we ended up storing our lamps.) It looks really nice in our older home. The only complaint I have about this thing is that the pull chains are ridiculously short. So I guess, consider that and your ceiling height when ordering and maybe also buy some chain extenders."
2,Hunter Fan,"Great fan, but the light is not. If you need light this is not the fan for you. The bulbs are the small mount type, so you can`t use the standard bulb for more light..............johan"
1,part missing,The package was short one blade for the fan. Had to pay an electrician to come and install it at 4100/hour and he couldn't because of that. I need the other fan blade.
4,loved the look,"My mom wanted a modern ceiling fan and I wanted a vintage look, this fan provided a modern sleek look, but still had the look of a vintage style too. We both loved the look and the style of it. It works great too, both the fan and the light on it."
1,Blades create windmill-like shadows on ceiling,"While we love the appearance of this fan (the wood is very attractive with the darker metal trim) and the fan runs quietly and smoothly, BEWARE that the glass of the light kit is open at the top, meaning that the light shines upward onto the ceiling. When the light is on and the fan is running, you get shadows on the ceiling of the spinning blades. It's VERY distracting and hard on the eyes. Think of the people who live in the shadow of a windmill, it's that sort of effect. I read reviews on this fan before purchasing, and I can't believe no one mentioned the awful spinning shadows. It's especially bad as the evening gets later and there is less natural light in the room to diffuse the shadows. I would not recommend this fan to anyone, as the spinning shadows on the ceiling are just awful to live with."
3,ceiling fan with light,"I wanted this Hunter fan/light for a new sunroom addition to our home. The electrician was due to come and install my lights in a few days, due to an illness I couldn't get out to a major store to select one. The Hunter fan/light arrived within a few days from amazon and was as described. For the money, I believe it to be of good value. The only reason I rated it a 3 was the appearance. I could not tell a lot about the fixture from it's picture. It is quiet and works well."
5,I love this fan!!!,"AMAZON IS WONDERFUL....THE FAN ARRIVED WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO AND ITS BEAUTIFUL...MY OLD FAN LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ROCKING ITSELF OUT OF THE CEILING WHEN IT WAS ON HIGH...IN FLORIDA YOU REALLY NEED HIGH SPEED!!! THIS ONE IS SO QUIET AND NO WOBBLING!!!! THE COLOR-I CHOSE WAS BRUSHED NICKEL AND WOW ITS SO NICE, THE INSTALLATION WAS A BIT TEDIOUS BUT WE GOT IT IN...MY ONLY ISSUE WAS THAT THE PULLS WEREN'T IN THE BOX....SO FOR A QUICK FIX I JUST TOOK THEM OFF THE OLD ONE, I TRIED TO CONTACT HUNTER BUT SO FAR NO RESPONSE...OH WELL JUST A SMALL PROBLEM..."
3,hunter fan,No problem with the dealer shipment was received promptly. The fan is making some noise which I do not like I have contacted the manufacturer and they suggested I contact the dealer about their return policy which I have done.I am now waiting to see if the noise will continue if it does I will get a return authorization. Thanks
1,Huter warranty is terrible !!! Low profile 3 plus model # 20801,"I had 6 Huter Fans in my house, the last one has just installed and motor made noises, I calld Huter, the customer service told me, it was not motor problem, but it was a part in there went bad, so no warranty was covered. He had to order that part and shipping cost total of approxiately $38.00. I refused to buy and properly give it to someone since I don't want to spend one more penny on Huter Fan. BTW, it was made in China !That was Huter Fan Limited Lifetime Waranty !!!!"
2,OKay. Just Okay...,"Air movement is somewhat disappointing. I bought a couple of Hampton Bay fans for other bedrooms (same size), and the high speed is higher on them. The fan is slightly out of balance, so I will need to work on balancing it, unlike the Hampton Bay fans. It was missing the tassel ends for the chains, so I'm contacting Hunter directly on getting them. If the electrician had not already installed it, I would have returned it. Hopefully, the motor will last longer on the Hunter. It was supposed to have medium base bulbs, but it actually has candelabra base - not my favorite. In its favor, it is a very nice looking fan and it is quiet. Amazon needs to adjust its ""return"" policy to include shipping missing parts so you don't have to return a bulky item for a small missing part. They have no easy way to contact them regarding such issues."
3,I'm a fan of the fan ...just not enough light!,"I bought this to be mounted centrally in a large bedroom. The fan itself is beautiful and durable but I didn't give the lighting factor enough thought before ordering. It gives off very little light and the small amount that does illuminate is filtered by the frosted glass. For example, in order to see enough to pack a suitcase I have to set up another lamp close by. May need to figure out a way to add a different light kit to it. Also, the bulbs are quite difficult for me to change. As I'm hanging from the thing I realize I'm getting too old to do the acrobatics required to get it done safely."
4,Decent Fan...Bulbs Dim,"This is a decent fan, although not great. But for the money, it is about what you would expect. What I didn't expect was for the bulbs to be so dim. With two 60 watt bulbs, the light fixture is supposed to have a combined 120 watts of lighting power. It is more like ONE 60 watt bulb, very dim. And we bought two of these units, so we now have two rooms with dim lighting. Part of the ""adventure"" of buying, sight unseen, on Amazon.Also, the instructions are not always clear, so be prepared. Some of what they tell you to do just doesn't make any sense, and the pictures don't help.I give it 5 stars for price and appearance, 3 stars for ease of installation and overall quality, and 2 stars for the lights. That averages in my mind to 4 stars. You get what you pay for..."
2,Disappointing performance,"This is the third Hunter ceiling fan I've purchased in two years. The first two were for small bedrooms (less than 130 SF) and this third one is for a larger bedroom (150 SF). The installation was straightforward, simple and went up quickly. No problems there.Turning it on and adjusting the fan speed proved a disappointment. The other two ceiling fans for the smaller bedrooms turn much faster at its highest setting, but this Astoria 22461 fan turns about the same speed on its highest setting as the other two on their 2nd or middle speed. All three were approximately the same price.Don't buy this fan if you're expecting strong air movement for a larger room. Buy another brand or different model of Hunter. Not recommended."
1,Leaked,"Mine was only one month old when I noticed a ring of fog on the inside of the watch face. Victorinox wants $10 for shipping and handling when sent in on warranty. I bought a Wenger instead, and am happy with it."
5,Another Effective Pimsleur Course,"This course is a direct continuation of the first two Pimsleur Spanish courses, and has the usual helpful repetition, variation, and gradual increase in vocabulary and grammar that make the Pimsleur system so effective. The system is almost entirely auditory, so it is advisable to supplement this course with some reading and writing exercises, if you want to learn to read newspapers or signs, or even to write simple letters. (I was stunned to recently discover that ""which"" is spelled ""cual"", not ""qual"" in Spanish, as I had been visualizing through the first two courses.) But this approach is an excellent way to develop confident fluency in Spanish conversation."
3,Why this is the least expensive,The lessons come on CDs and load into iTunes undelineated by lesson ... you can create audiobooks with chapter delineations using a download called Audiobook Builder ($9.99 Sept 2012) ... easy to learn to use.This is my guess as to why this seller can offer Pimsleur Spanish III for about half the price of the other sellers. I am very satisfied with the audiobook I was able to make from these CDs.
4,almost worth the 30 bucks,"One of my 'almost 30' friends recommended it. Ive used it 3 times in 2 weeks and have already noticed almost lasting results with using it. Instead of using the moisturizer that comes with it, I've been using the vitamin c cream from the next shelf over in the store. its better than what comes in the package. Im still waiting for the unit to start smoking, tho. Its still worth the 30 bucks if there isn't a reputable salon near your hometown to do the dermabrasion for you."
5,Very Good.,I don't trust this product for the first time because I never heard this product before.I bought this product in Target.I notice that my face looked young after a couple of months.I used to apply this on my face before I go to bed and after I exercise.This product is effective to me and I loose all of my pimples.This product is a fast reacting product.
2,Fell apart quickly,"it works fine just like any other clipper, but mine broke within a few uses. i'll plug it in and turn it on, and it won't turn on, then i have to hold the switch in a certain position to keep it on while i cut my hair. not exactly convenient. the operation aside from this flaw is fine, but that's a pretty big flaw so i'm giving it a bad review."
2,Not enough cutting power,"I am not sure if the problem is related to the overall design or the how the blades are sharpened at the factory, but this unit is just like every other set of clippers I have purchased as a home user -- It does not cut very well. It takes 3 or 4 passes over the same area of the head to completely cut the hair in that area. This holds true for different types of hair. I wish I could find something that works well."
2,video slots,I thought the slots would be a little more like the ones I was used to playing at the casino's. The viewing on the screen is too large.
2,Mildly Entertaining,"Now I understand why it's in a jewel case for only 10 bux.I very much enjoy REEL (mechanical) slots, I hardly play actual video slots in the casinos. However, the reel machines depicted in Best of Slots II share the same boring graphic and especially sound format machine-to-machine. The reels change, and the upper plate (pay) glass artwork changes. That's about it.The game play feel does not change, with the exception of only a few machines. Furthermore, the CD must be kept in the drive!I just installed ""Reel Deal Slots GHOST TOWN"" and have found it to be far superior in every aspect for stand alone play."
5,Classic,"Absolutely blilliant live album! I'm middleaged now and I was in the army when ""Hanx"" came out - and I can tell you: We listened to ""Tin Soldiers"" day and night!"
4,hanx is as good as the best,"missed all of their concerts - if more than two - in belgium, i think this is the best nearest; great enjoyment everytime i listen to ""hanx"""
5,"I love, love, love this CD!!!","I would be lost without it. Even if you hate Disney, I can't recommend it enough. I can put it on while working and it just brightens up my day!! No vocals, all instrumental, wonderful for anyone who wants to relaz or liven up."
5,Love the Steel Pans1,This is a wonderful CD to use with students. I used it with my special needs students and the staff and students both enjoy it a lot. I will probably order other CDs in the future featuring the steel pans. Thanks for the great Music in perfect condidtion
2,No Harry Belafonte,"My 4 month old daughter loves her grandparents Harry Belafonte cd. I saw this and thought that it would be fun Disney music similar in style to Harry Belafonte. I was very disappointed. To me, it was not danceable and the couple songs I heard lacked vocals. I would not recommend it if Harry Belafonte is what you are looking for. Unfortunately, I do not have audio on my computer, so I could not listen to it ahead of time."
5,Smells Great,"A wonderful new video from Hermie! The Hermie universe always introduces silly and fun new characters to the garden, such as the stinky Stanley and Skeeter, the Mosquito with no sense of direction. Judge Reinhold provides a cute and endearing voice as Stanley. This story does a great job of helping us to accept those who are different than us and finding what qualities they have that are good. This is also one of Don Knotts' final acting efforts so it's worth it to enjoy him for one of the last times."
4,Great for Kids,"This is very well done. The story selection is very good and there is a picture on every page. Most kids age 3 and up will remain engaged. The illustrations are very realistic, reverent and not ""stylized"" which is very important to me as a Catholic who is utterly sick of the cartoonish pictures of Our Lord, the Saints and other Biblical personages.There's also a Bible-verse memorization program on the bottom of each page. A little bit of each verse is introduced at a time for easier memorization.The only criticism I offer is for the binding. The book has basically fallen apart, and that's a shame. Of course, that could be due to my kids being extra rough on books, but I doubt it."
5,Great!,I am thoroughly enjoying this book! I love the grammatical errors and misspellings.The absolutely impossible story line is pure gold! LMAO!
3,Food for thought,"It seems that one of the reasons Zukav became popular is the ""new age"" feel of his books, which to some may be attractive enough. I liked this book in a sense that it made me curious and go back to the physics I studied in high school and then on to some more contemporary work on quantum physics. As a non-physicist, I found this an interesting and thought provoking experience, but with obvious flaws. There have been numerous attempts to find the bridge between the rational, scientific thought of the West and contemplative ancient Eastern wisdom. This book is one of many, but how much it succeeded in this attempt is up to you to decide. If it incites your curiosity and gives you a push to search and research, it'll be ten bucks well spent."
4,Plain English clarification for Basic quantum mechanics,"This is exactly what I was looking for, I have to admit having read Gary's ""Seat of the Soul"", how this book would read. I was very pleasantly surprised."
5,The Dancing Wu Li Masters,"This book is a life-changing treatment of modern physics. It changes how we think of reality, of what we are. Well written, easy to grasp. Everyone should read this book."
3,A book meant for guys with fundaes in quantum-physics,I was conned into reading this book by a friend of mine(not any more).It is not meant for normal people.Though being from an engineering background I found this book to be abstruse.My recommendation:dont read this book unless you are marooned with it on a desert island.
1,I haven't recieved the item.,"I have not recieved my order. The book ""Dancing Wu Li Masters"" has not arrived. I would like to get it soon.Thank YouEd Chevalley"
2,Danger Ahead,"I read this book when it was new, and found it entertaining. I didn't think much more about it after that. Then I came upon a reference to it in one of Gardner's books concerning bad science. Looking back at it knowing so much more now, I agree, it's borderline nonsence. E.g. electrons don't ""think"" about making a choice about which way to go; they enter into superposition."
5,Physics that doesn't shrink your head,"I read this book quite a number of years ago and it still holds the place of showing me I'm not totally stupid. A sort of special theory of relativity exists between the reader and Gary Zukav.In most writings (even textbooks) there appears to be a move to obscure the plot line in order to provide drama and heighten ones sense of the authors profound wisdom. Gary has no ego of this sort. This is a friendly book. Gary is magical in making some of the most seemingly difficult theories understandable.I read this book and shortly thereafter, so did my wife who usually expresses no interest in things ""scientific"". I was amazed at the high fallootin' conversations that occured with my wife. We were throwing around physics terms like doctoral fellows."
2,A very hard book for me to understand the purpose/message,"I tried to read this book, as I have really enjoyed all other books by Gary Zukav. This was the exception. I just couldn't get through the entire book, so maybe I missed the point or message of the book. It was not easy reading."
1,Entertaining clap-trap,"I'll qualify the rating: It's one star if you want some entertainment, zero stars if you think you'll gain anything of scientific value.This book is an interesting and intellectually seductive waste of time - or, should I say space-time continuum?The entire discourse is a series of circuitous ""logic"", like chains of circles forming spheres forming circles. The irony is that Zukav says ""...going around in a circle is one kind of dead end."" I agree."
1,Anti-Western new age nonsense,"Zukav has a decidedly anti-Western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking. This is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics. Rather than writing a laconic outline of physics, Zukav spends the majority of his time praising Eastern thought and toying with the idea that everything is subjective.The reader is referred to any college physics textbook or Isaac Asimov's History of Physics or a good set of encylopedias."
2,Not an fun read,I was hoping for something much more layman in explaining the great quantum physics. It is not an easy read. I have found other books that were more easy to read on the subject.
4,Received,"I got the book right on time and I am in the middle of moving, so when I unpack I'll be able to read it. I got this from a word-of-mouth, and I am sure I will love it.Thanks."
2,mind blowing!,"I can`t review because I gave it as a gift. My Son wants me to read it now because he was very impressed . I sent another by same author-- ""the Seat of the Soul"" (I think)"
3,Interesting Yet Technical,"This book was a challenging read as the author attempts to explain the basics of a very complex theories. I found myself struggling to understand the differences between quantum physics, particle theory, the theory of relativity and other aspects of physics. These theories have been discovered by some of the greatest thinkers of all time and thus not easy to understand. While this made for a challenging read, I did learn the importance of keeping an open mind and thus made the book worthwhile. Too often we allow a preconceived way of thinking to prevent further understanding. This is one of the underlying themes of the book and interestingly enough is how a lot of the breakthroughs in physics/quantum mechanics were discovered. The concepts can be applied to just about every aspect of learning. Despite the challenges, this book is worth reading for that reason alone."
4,"Great insight for people wondering ""Why me?"" or ""What is God?""",This is a very basic introduction to quantum mechanics and spirituality which seem to be explorations of the same happenings/situations.
3,Very readable but...,"The Dancing Wu Li Masters is very entertaining and accessible but it should be understood that Mr. Zukav is by no means an authority on the subject (Neither am I, mind you). First check out the similiar books by Polkinghorne or Pagels or one of the many good books by Paul Davies. These men are REAL physicists!"
4,Interersted in reconciling science and spirituality...,"This book succeeds in a few ways:1) It does a great job of introducing the laymen to physics / quantum mechanics principles2) Through the exploration of the role of creativity in the ""true"" scientific process, exposes something about human nature3) Without proselytizing, invites the reader to reconcile scientific theories with idea of a higher power via their relation to some of the tenets of eastern philosophy.By using physics as a reference, Zukav subtly presents the notion of human nature powering the search for eternal truths. Coincidently, it seems that both science and spirituality are paths to that same goal.It is a great read for anyone interested in an introduction to these issues. And will serve as a perfect springboard for more in-depth research into physics (not just quantum mechanics), and eastern philosophy."
5,Layman's Viewpoint,"I am not a physicist. I am not a budhist. However, I found this book to be a wonderful journey into the realm of both. Zukav strikes at the heart of modern science and reminds the Western world that it's all old news. It was a challenging read, delightful at times, eye-opening at others. If you like books by Hawking and Green, Zukav is the next step towards contemplating quantum mechanics and particle physics. If you like the tao teh ching, this is also a must read. In order to understand the beast of what is reality, it is neccessary to use tools appropriate per individual. For the scientist that has become so dependent on data as to forget to question it's meaning, this is an important step in self awarness."
2,New-age mysticism for new-age afficianados,"Not my cup of tea at all. Zukav's general formula for the dogma in this book is of the form: (A <relationship 1> B) and (C <relationship 2> D), where relationship 1 and relationship 2 have the same name but different domains of discourse, therefore A = C and B = D. It's the typical charlatan's play on words, repeated many times - attractive only to the ignorant and the gullible. Don't let this be your introduction to quantum mechanics (or new-age philosophy). You'll be disapponted on both fronts."
3,Not the condition I expected,The book was in worse condition than I would have expected. THe cover had a torn off corner and the book looked more aged than I would have bought had I seen the book before buying
4,eureka!,"The system works fine I have lost about 14 pound in 6 weeks! I am from Lima, Peru, and everybody wants to know more about misses Puhn system. I will like more examples of what to eat in a normal day, specially the dinner options. She makes you identify with her clients problems and feelings. Is there a spanish version? Thank you"
4,"Good, common sense information! Gets you on the right track!","I started following this plan about 1 1/2 years ago. I lost over 70 lbs and have some more to go. I gained over the holidays and plan to just get back on the plan again. So many people wonder what was my ""miracle"" solution and many people that I know have gone out to buy the book. The only problem with the book is that it is not written well. There are a lot of redundancies - but for the most part the plan works great and is a great life style change."
5,Best diet book I've ever tried.,This book is the ONLY one that really accomplishes what it says. I learned so much about sugar levels. You really see results by the end of day 5. I lost 7lbs in a week and half. And continued loosing for several weeks.
1,No Miracle,"I tried this diet for a week and did not lose an ounce. I realize that perhaps if I had stuck with it I might have seen results, but I couldn't make it through another week. The 5 days did NOT change my life. This diet is high maintenance and all you ever do is think about food, not because you're hungry, but because you have to. Eating every two or three hours as is REQUIRED by this diet is very inconvenient and can be very stressful. Also, at the end of the first five days, I felt worse, not better. I had a continuous headache, was constantly dizzy, and always tired. If you're looking for a miracle, look somewhere else."
2,"High maintenance, unrealistic plan.","Ms. Puhn helps explain the problem with eating high glycemic ""trash"" carbs like bagels, muffins, and other fat free dishes. The case she makes however is explained and dealt with better by Drs. Richard and Rachael Heller. They're program consists of 2 low fat protein meals, and the 3rd meal consists of a small protein serving and then a meal of healthy carbs."
3,"Makes sense in theory, but unrealistic","I am a young woman with diabetic parents. The idea of this book as a diabetes prevention diet was what first attracted me. While it all makes sense on paper, I have no interest in a diet where eating a half of a banana constitutes cheating, or where craving a brownie should launch a full scale investigation of your self- esteem and fear of intimacy. sorry!"
3,What about picky eaters?,"I read this book and it sounds great and makes a lot of sense. The problem: I am a picky eater. I don't like broccoli and cauliflower and other raw veggies. What do I do? This is just like every other diet; they don't consider the picky eaters. Plus being a teacher I find it hard to do the hard chews on schedule. I don't allow my students to eat in class so I don't either, when am I supposed to eat my hard chews?"
2,This book is too confusing to be worthwhile,"I read this book and tried to follow the diet to no avail. The tips and tricks she offers are unrealistic and impossible to actually do right. The diet seems like it's too good to be true, and it would work, but only if you want to put an INHUMAN effort behind every little aspect of the diet. . . and of course, if you mess up one little thing, you've messed up everything. This diet just didn't work at all."
2,Starving in Michigan,"I was left so hungary on this diet, all I could do was think about food. I kept an eye on the clock just waiting for the two hour mark, when I could have something to eat. This diet book was of no use to me. Of course you will lose weight if you starve yourself."
3,A good plan to follow if you've got a good digestive system.,"I was very interested in Ms. Puhn's diet, but found I could not stay on it because it wreaked havoc with my digestive system. The book recommends eating lots of raw veggies, especially as hard chew snacks. But Ms. Puhn offers no alternatives for those who can't digest such foods. The first day, I followed her directives and ate crisp brocolli and raw carrots as my snacks and also with my meals. I was so sick I was forced to spend two days on the B R A T diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast)! What I like about this book is Puhn's insistence that guilt need not be a requisite part of this or any diet. A much welcome message. As for Ms. Puhn's writing style, I found her use of language to be somewhat annoying -- the first time she advises that we eat hard chew snacks to ""tie the bow"" on the good blood sugar, it was cute in a trite sort of way, but tolerable. By the eighth or ninth time, it was downright boring."
3,"It really will work, so lighten up.","I laughed when I read some other reviews of this book. You don't buy a diet book for good writing, you buy it for the plan. This plan will work. You can lose weight even if you do not stick to it rigidly. As long as you apply the main principles - timing your meals and snacks according to the plan and eating the right kinds of foods - you will lose weight and feel great doing it. If you feel the need to stick to a diet rigidly, measure your food, and want to know exactly which things you can and can't have, then you probably should talk to your own doctor about a diet rather than relying on a book. So lighten up. Take it for what it's worth."
3,Easy steps to follow,"There are some good ""take away"" items that are practical. Follow the basic plan and you will see results. I lost about 10 pounds by more or less following her plan a few years ago. It works if the plan is followed initially to get your body chemistry (blood sugar) to the right levels. Then just follow it within reason after that. It is always better to adopt a realistic plan that can be maintained over time."
3,5 Day Miracle Diet,"I found that the diet described is too restrictive for me because I'm a diabetic. However, it might work well for someone who is not. This book did get me started eating healthier and I actually have lost a few pounds as a result."
4,"Miracle, not quite...","It isn't really a ""miracle"" diet. This plan requires a lot of effort... BUT it totally pays off in the end: I have been on this diet before and lost weight the healthy way (no more liquid diets for me!) I plan to go back on this diet because it made me feel so energetic and great about myself."
4,Effective but hard to follow,"I tried this book about 1 month before my wedding because, of course, I had to look great! I must say that it really worked. I lost about 5 pounds in the 2 weeks that I followed it. I was only trying for 5 - 10 so I was happy. Thing is, I'm also an avid exerciser and I found this diet didn't give me enough energy to do my usual workouts. As well, there's a lot of preparation involved and figuring out what you can eat when, etc. For the purposes I used it, it was great but it's definately not something I could follow for a long time."
1,Sorely Disappointed,"What a disappointment. I followed the plan for a full month. A month of hunger pangs and crabbiness. My sweatheart urged me to get off, I was just so dispondent to have lost barely 5 pounds of the 20 I want to lose! The text is poorly organized but I was so determined that I dog eared the pages to make certain I could get the correct info when I needed it. I hoped that feeling so hungry would get better results but it only offered frustration. It did, however, send me back to the Weight Watcher's plan where I can get these results and still be a human. Adele, you promise the world but you don't deliver."
1,Don't waste your money,"I wasn't actually expected a miracle diet, but this book is ridiculous. The entire books reads like an extended infomercial. You'll have to slog through account after account of how amazing this diet is before you get to the meat of the program on page 80+. The menus don't even start until page 100. This book might have been okay as maybe a 10 page pamphlet. Don't waste your money."
1,I hated it!,"This is a very poor attempt to emulate the 'Sugarbusters!' diet. It is badly written and repetitive.It is also misleading- of course this is not a 5 day diet -(nothing could be, so that should be a clue to its quality) 'Sugarbusters!' is 100% better."
1,"very confusing, tries to be to comical and is useless..","This book was recommended to me when I purchased ""Sugarbuster"" diet (which was very good)...It was very confusing, and not because it was too technical for me but was to me, purposely misleading because the author was merely trying to get you to buy the book but offered no answers...Every once in awhile it would, to me, steal hints and bits from ""Sugarbusters""...It was trying to be comical but fail short...A total waste of money, as far as i am concerned....Dieters and those who want to lose weight will only get confused, discouraged and frustrated by this terrible little work of ""art""....Buy it if you want, but don't say I didn't warn you..By the way, I think the reason Amazon.com is so successful is because it is open to these kinds of reviews by the people who read them and are able to report them....Thanks Amazon!!"
2,"Although this diet really works, the book is poorly written.","I am using Adelle's diet and it is working. However, it is really difficult to get past her cheesey, disorganized, scatter-brained approach to writing. Rather than putting the core information in a accessible place in the book, she scatters it about, and fills the middle with pseudo-inspiring mantras (she must say 100 times that extras should be something you ABSOLUTELY ADORE until I can practically envision her doing a high kick in her cheerleading outfit). My advice: give it a quick read and outline the good stuff in a page. One other comment: this book seems to assume that the reader is overweight in part due to a complete lack of exercise. If you, like me, exercise at least 5 times a week, you may need to eat a little more for breakfast than her diet recommends."
4,An excellent choice for any comic book fan.,"I was first introduced in RoLW a while back, from the OVA which aired a few times. I was able to get ahold of the DVs, and most recently wondered if I could find the original comics. I bought not ontl this one, bu the entire repring of the Grey Witch Series. I started to get worried because nowhere in the Review did it say if these books were in English! But they were! Things happen a bit differently in the comics, which is always nice to see what was changed for the movie, to compare and contrast.The only thing that prevents this from being a 5 is th lack of color, but I'm not complaining about anything else"
4,Liquid Gold Leaf,"This pen does what it says it does, but to restore fine gold lines on porcelin will take some practice because the tip is multi-purpose and there does not appear to be a fine point product. Still, for display plates and other items, it allows you to fill in the lines that have been worn off over time. I don't know how this would work if you were going to wash the object after restoring the gold line, nor did I investigate whether it is food safe, but for refinishing display pieces it works fairly well. I gave it only four stars because of the difficulty in creating a fine line with the tip that is provided, but otherwise it was exactly what I was looking for."
3,Sonic cd is good,"Sonic CD is a pretty good game. there are only two things that I don't like. first, Sonic dosen't get kinda scared when he sees Amy.Second, Amy runs around Sonicwith hearts and everything which stops sonic making him have to jump to move again.sonic cd is pretty good. i'd recomend getting this game on SONIC GEMS COLLECTIONBuy this game."
5,Sonic the Hedgehog CD,"Okay, this is, hands-down, Sonic's GREATEST 16-bit adventure EVER! (SCD's Special Stages still remain a favorite!) Q-Sound Stereo music (which completely topples anything that the Genesis/Mega Drive could ever reach!), 7 awesome-looking Zones, a new time-travel system, and cool new characters and moves make this Sonic's best old-school quest EVER!(Is OBSESSED with Spencer Nilsen's ""Sonic Boom"")P.S. This is the Sega CD/Mega CD version. If you have the PC version and are trying to run it on Windows XP, don't try it. THE PC VERSION OF ""Sonic the Hedgehog CD"" WILL NOT WORK ON WINDOWS XP!Just so you know. Ok, bye!"
1,¿Sin nombre de traductor?,"No he conseguido encontrar el nombre del traductor, algo muy preocupante dado que si se puede leer este libro en español es porque alguien lo tradujo. Obvio, ¿no? Pues parece que hay que recordarlo."
5,magnifica,"la estube buscando en espanol por mucho tiempo sin exito alguno.hasta k llegue a amazon,fue mi primera compra por kindle y sinceramente es una de las obras literarias favoritas, es simplemente magnifica,la termine en solo dos dias ya k no podia dejar de leerla,la recomiendo a toda persona k al igual k yo goze plenamente de la lectura..."
4,Mini,Me imagine que el libro iba a ser mas grande no se porque... Pero bueno lo importante es lo que tiene adentro no como es... Aunque creo que de verdad es muy sensible no creo que las hojas esten en su lugar por mucho tiempo con el tiempo
4,Muy buena traducción,"Pese a algunos errores tipográficos, la traducción de tremenda obra es muy buena y permite una lectura fluida. Vale mucho la pena."
2,Audio libro demasiado cortado,"Compre el audio libro sabiendo que era abridged pero cuando resulto ser 2 horas para una historia como Orgullo y Prejuicio, no compara para nada con la version original. Cortaron demasiados detalles y dieron algunas por sabido. La historia resulto ser muy sosa. Ademas, los interpretes no tenian voces muy distintas y me confundia mucho con quien hablaba."
4,Orgullo y Prejuicio en Español,"This is a good story, kind of romantic but not very much. I enjoy reading it even though I think the translation to Spanish is not very good"
4,muy bueno y entretenido,"Me enganchó tiene buena narrativa, la historia es mas o menos buena, a pesar de haber sido escrito hace muchos años aun se mantiene vigente, y toca temas interesantes.Lo recomiendo sobretodo por su precio."
5,Love Bernie,I have really enjoyed reading many of Bernie's books. They are very inspiring and motivating. I would recommend this one as well.
1,Constantine has crossed the line in this version,"I paid the ""premium"" price under the enticement of wide screen 16 X 9, in digital stereo - blah, blah, blah...A total ripoff. Quality extremely poor. Sound had a constant thump in it and was tinny and bleary like a bad speaker at a drive-in movie. The quality of the print cannot be helped as this is a fifty year old film that hasn't been restored. As for the widescreen, etc... It was a cropped image of the standard full-screen version, then blown up to occupy the screen's space. This was originally filmed in a European generic cinemascope-like process. This print was a standard fullscreen non-anamorphic copy. I purchased a previous copy ten years ago for less than five dollars which, I am sorry to say, is better than this ""enhanced"" version."
3,Only ONE lid and it's PLASTIC,"I ordered this because it says: ""Glass and plastic lids make cooking, serving, and storing easy and convenient"". Glas and plastic lids - sure shounds like there are more than one lid there. Lids - plural. Silly me, it only came with one plastic lid. I contacted coustomer service and they were getting ready to send another one just like it. I finally got them to check to see how many lids and what kind of lids were included. I wish someone would proof read the ads.It's a nice little dish with ONE PLASTIC LID and NO GLASS LID."
3,bad fit,The oval dish was as I expected but one of the covers doesn't fit. The other cover fits both dishes but is difficult to use even when I preheated it under hot water to stretch it out.
4,Great for lunches,"I bought this because I have one I have used for years, but the lid finally cracked. Now I have 2 dishes and one lid. The lid on this one is a little stiff so I am hoping it loosens up. Sometimes it's a bit hard to get off. It is the perfect size for leftovers at lunch time to take to work. Great buy, but I wish I could have just bought a lid."
2,15 ounce oval dish,I would not buy this again. It is too small . The picture makes it look big. I should have realized that 15 ounces is not very big.
4,Superb,"Saw him sing this album near Florence this year. An artist taking risks and at the peak of his writing skills. Melodic, delightful."
2,what happend to his voice ?,"I was a big fan of Pino Daniele in the early 80's with all his association with jazz musicians.I stopped listening to his music for a long time ( too commecial , too pop , too rock !) I run and bought this cd , thinking that with a band like this ( Peter Erskine trio ) this can only be great...... ! well for my disapointment his voice has tremendisly weaken ? ! the music is great , great arangement , good solos , but he is realy strugling with his voice on that project . it's a bit sad !"
1,Tributo a Waldir Azevedo,"This audio CD is a fine example of Waldir Azevedo's compositions with focus on the cavaquinho (a tiny 4-string guitar). After having been to Brazil and hearing some very infectious melodies in a particular type of Brazilian music - choro - described as New Orleans jazz of Brazil, this recording is a wonderful example. It is a complex musical form based upon improvisation with samba and bossa nova rhythms. It is a fine accompaniment while watching videos of my Brazilian pictures. This should be given a four-star rating - the ""star-rating"" above was not responsive and somehow indicated only one star."
5,Light at end of tunnel... and directions for getting there!,"This book is very positive about our children who think differently. It's easy to dwell on the limitations my child has, but this book encouraged me stop and think about the positive side of his ""quirkiness."" It doesn't deny the difficulties faced by ""attention-different"" children, but points out that there is a flip side to their way of thinking. And in fact the book helps you look at how the ""solution"" to the child's difficulties may actually lie in the ""problem"" itself. Best of all, it gives specific directions for helping your child create a well-grounded sense of himself, which I believe will be the key to success for my son. I first checked this book out from the library but realized I will be coming back to it again and again. I bought one for myself and copies for each of two friends with difficult children."
3,"Standard, but good for price","Personally I like the true tone feel, but it is having some tear lines on the inside of the back cover, and wrinkles on the inside front and back where the glue area is at.Paper is not too bad actually. Font size is good (but that's relative to age, I'm in late 20's)Small concordance, haven't really found it that useful but it's somethingDefinitely not to be used for study or everyday purposes.I personally use it more as a convenience (feel strange saying that), a little thing here and there.I use it more for worships each morning at our academy rather than visitation or quick study."
3,it's bonded leather,"This item is not leather bound, as stated. It is bonded leather, much to my chagrin. Let the buyer beware."
5,Seductive Dee Dee,"If there ever were a voice of seduction for me- It's Dee Dee Bridgewater. Here she finds some unique material as well as some truly GREAT melodies that let her voice just soar. ""Lost in The Stars"" and ""Bilbao Song"" are just a sample. But don't miss the very funny, uncredited version of ""Mack The Knife""- It shows that you can still have fun and be a serious jazz singer."
5,Should Win Her Second Grammy,"Weill songs require not just a singer but an actress and Dee Deecan do both. She gives new life to standards like ""Speak Low""and ""This is New"". I love the flamenco guitar on ""Bilbao Song"" and the bandeleon on ""Youkali"". This is obviously a labor of lovebetween the singer and her musicians. ""I'm A Stranger HereMyself"" and ""Alabama Song"" show Dee Dee and the musicians attheir improvisational best. A winner all the way."
5,Great Book,"Amazing talent. Dion Endo seems like he is a new writer since i can't find any of his other works online, but as a debut attempt, it is a an excellent book. It is vaguely reminiscent of American literary classics and a remarkable example of life around the time of World War 2. Plus, i think he is a Hawaii-boy and you can't go wrong with that."
3,Pretty good,This cd is pretty good. It has some good songs. I suggest some of the briggs' earlier cds first though.
2,An opinion on 'fat girls',"This book is 10% romance and 90% ""oh, she'd be so pretty if she lost a little weight'. The 90% got tiresome... fast.Why can't authors have a chunky heroine or hero without focusing on the chunky?"
5,A dream boat of a relationship and a man,"I technically shouldn't have liked this book--too perfect, indeed. But instead I found myself loving it! Like every word and concept. A warm blanket and hot chocolate on a cold night. A loving embrace from a friend. This book could rightfully go under ""self help"" or ""feel good about yourself."" Where can I find a Byron?? Nice, nice, nice. Not for everyone I'm sure, but it touched me just right."
5,Perfect for Light Summer Reading,"Perfect for lighthearted romantic reading. I actually bought this second-hand at a garage sale for my daughter as she loves to read this type of lighthearted romance. I usually read heavier things as my free time is limited and I don't want to 'waste' any good reading time I might have, but I picked this up on a whim one evening before I had a chance to pass it on to my daughter and I got caught up in the plight of the 'not perfect' girl getting involved with a 'too perfect' guy. Easy reading with a predictable outcome, but just the right kind of thing to take your mind off of your own troubles for a while and make believe again that fairy tales can come true. (Then back to reality - what a downer!)"
4,Too Perfect,"Entertaining story, relatable characters, sweet love story. This is the third in a very fun series. Talented writer and the story keeps you going rooting for the characters to hang in there and fight for what they want without being afraid to believe they are lucky enough for this kind of love and happiness."
3,Too much sex,Sex doesn't put a book on my hit list. Edit.Leave it out. It is not necessasry for the story.
3,Slow beginning,Slow beginning to the book but it does draw you in like the first two once you get far enough in it.
5,Great read!,"It was a great story. Once I started the one, I had to read all three. Hoping to find more stories to be wrapped up in like I was with these 3."
5,Excellent,I finished this book within 24 hrs. I was really sad when it was over. I would definitely recommend this book. Julie Ortolon is currently my favorite author.
1,construction should have been a give away,"I should have returned it before i went through the trouble of putting this filter on. By this i mean, it didn't look like it had a decent screwing mechanism in place for when you need to change filter down the road and it doesn't. I guess you have to forceably pull it apart. I decided to ignore that aspect for now being excited to try the difference in having a filtered water but alas the leakage through the seems was so bad that i had to send it back. I am now ordering the white one with a screw mechanism, hopefully no leaks."
5,very good filter,"very heavy chrome plated brass filter. Filters out all bad small, tatse and color from shower water. I like it very much."
1,Thought it was working?,"I moved to FL and the water in WPB is too hard! Leaves water spots on everything. I started getting a rash on my shoulders, face breaking out, my beautiful hair was breaking...so I tried the Vitamin C filter first in July, and everything seem fine. So I put that one in the other bathroom after using it in my bathroom for 1 month. I decided to try the sprite filter and put in my bathroom. First month ok, but started noticing dry skin. Flipped it over, I am getting skin irritations, dry skin, water spots...I bought this in late Sept 2012...I do not recommend and it didn't last a year or a proper 2 months!!!!"
2,Leaks,"First, according to the documentation that came with it, this filter only removes about 50 percent of the chlorine in tap water, and it does not remove any chlorine byproducts at all. Thinking that any filter is better that no filter (usually applied to pitcher filters, etc.), I installed it anyway. It leaked. The O-ring that fits on either end of the little barrel filter had not seated properly. Water all over the place. Took it down. Took it apart. Put it back together. No leak for two months. Then the other day, turned on the shower, heard a pop, and it leaks again. Took it down, took it apart. Put it back together. Still leaks. It's going into the trash. Don't bother with this filter, if for no other reason than it's not very good at what it claims to do. There are more effective products out there. I have one in my other place."
4,"Very good, but noisy and expensive.","After nearly 2 months of usage, it's time to review this product. It's not perfect but I think it's probably as good as it gets in this category. I'm glad that I purchased this one over the alternatives. Subtracted 1 star because of price and noise.THE GOOD- My skin is not as dry as it usually is in the winter months.- Filter doesn't impede the water flow very much.- Filters last for a long time.THE BAD- Quite expensive.- High-pitched squealing noise! We notice the annoying high-frequency whine every single time that we shower. YMMV.- Very heavy, you'll want to make sure that your shower arm can support this much weight."
4,"Slight change of sound, but still the Pennywise we all love","This really is a great cd. It has tons of very fast paced songs that really get you up and moving. Only problem . . . the lyrics haven't really changed. They are still the same, bitching about society and how corrupt it is. This, of course, is true, and I like a positive message likt the one the put out, but it just isn't new.Despite, it's still an excellent cd. I wouldn't hesitate to buy it."
4,This album gets you pumped for a surf,"To those that say lagging waggon, green berret and other teeny bop punk bands. This is not their best album but it is still a notch higher than all the rest. Unknown road will never be topped but for a band who lost their bassist they've made a strong rebound on their last two albums. RIP Jason."
1,"the music sucks, and they sold out","When I first listened to this cd, I was kind of surprised. It really sucked except for a couple songs. What happened to PENNYWISE? I got a kick out of these other reviews saying they sounded like corporate mainstream/popular bands such as ""korn"", ""limp bizkit"", ""sublime"", ""green day"". People like that will eventually turn away from the band when they're not that popular anymore. If you want good punk rock, listen to Pennywise's Unknown Road, or anything by Black Flag. XmikeX"
3,pennywise...,"this album is just...boring and repetitive . It sounds more like metal than punk . the first few songs like greed and alien are really fun to listen to , but near the end of the album it just gets worse . If you want to listen to good pennywise , then get self-titled or unknown road"
2,"a boring cd, and a complete waste","I was totally bored when I heared this cd.I mean maybe I should try another cd of theirs but this one was a waste of 8.99.I mean I love punk and its sound but this was a bad one.I gave it 2 stars because it had a couple good songs,like Greed,can't believe it,and my own way"
3,Not Bad,"It's a good cd but I don't think it even compares with their older recordings like ""About Time."" I think PW needs to go back to the faster and fatter sound they used to have."
4,Pretty good stuff but not their best,"At first I didn't like this cd. I couldn't sit down and listen to it. I thought it was almost all slow. Then after giving it a good listen and listening past the intros I realized I really like this cd. Strong points: 1) Great recording sound. The sound is really crisp and clean with great production. 2) Vocals sound great. Jim really shows his talent here. 3) Hit home lyrics as only Pennywise can deliver 4) Check out Can't Take It, American Dream, Still Can Be Great, and One Voice. Bad Points: 1) Kinda slow despite progression 2)Some songs sound too much like others. Never the less its a solid release. Check out Unknown Road or Full Circle first but definately pick this up"
5,Great Punk!,"It doesn't matter if the songs on this cd sound radio friendly or not. What does matter is the content. If you like what point the lyrics are trying to make then buy the damn thing, listen to it and dont worry what other people think about the cd. Be your own person. I like it and that is all that matters."
5,It's out of this world!,"This is definately,there best comeback since full circle. I'll definately have to give this 5 stars. If your a Pennywise fan and you don't have this, your really insane."
4,The most radio friendly album,"You can say that Pennywise sold out because they had a couple of singles, ""victim of reality"" and ""Alien"", off this album. The truth is that even though this is a little slower album in some parts. It is probably the most branching out that Pennywise is going to do. Most of the songs are still very aggressive and the lyrics are always meaningful. I think this is a very good follow-up to Full circle which is a good album. Best songs: ""Greed"", ""my own country"" and "" badge of pride"""
3,I CANT BELIEVE IT,"this album is too soft but its okay. i cant beleive people saying that PENNYWISE looks like greenday. gimme a break i think those people hear PENNYWISE for the first time and dont have any idea about punk rock. couse PENNYWISE never ever could be compared with greenday. PUNNK ROCK isnt greenday, it is BAD RELIGION, PENNYWISE and a lot of else."
2,"Ummm, did I miss something?","I guess it's just me, but this seems pretty, well, dead is I guess the best way to put it. Previous pennywise stuff, while nothing more than Bad Religion's last album a lot of the time, always had an energy behind it that saved them from being written off as another wannabe. Said energy is lacking on this release from start to go, I'm afraid to report. Straight from the get-go, you notice that the lyrics are a lot weaker than their previous stuff, and the music plays the background role, and most of it sounds like BR's ""Suffer"" 12 years later and slowed down. ""My Own Country,"" which many people think is an awesome political anthem, NEVER SAYS ANYTHING! How can you make an anthem without a political message at all? It's this vagueness that plagues this whole album, and makes me wish it had never come my way."
2,Get your Pennywise shirt today,"If theres one thing that can be said about Pennywise, its that they found their style early on and have stuck with it. cd after cd, you know its Pennywise cuz it all basically sounds the same, which i love. I hate it when bands experiment. But this one is somehow different. Sure, it sounds the same as every other album theyve put out, and the first several songs are amazing, but after those, all the power and catchiness seems to leave and you just get empty songs. I dont know. Go with Full Circle or About Time first."
2,Ehhh,"I really hate to slam a cd, and I know I'm gonna get into big trouble with the serious fans, but I really don't like this cd. I bought it mainly for ""Alien"" (Which is a great song.) The only problem is the other songs can't back it up. It's really driving; there are no other melodic songs like Alien on it. One thing that's pretty stupid is everyone bills them as a ""positive and uplifting"" band. Sure, 'Might be a dream,' and 'Still can be great' are positive. With lyrics like ""One good shot and you'll end up dead / it's violence on the streets and it will never end"" on 'Victim of reality,' you'd think they might be a punk-Soundgarden without the creativity. Okay, I said it. Sorry, but that's just my opinion."
4,Conformity?,"Is Pennywise about to conform to standards to mainstream/popular radio and the popular culture with this latest album? Only time will tell. Pennywise is about not conforming and deals with issues such as the government and the popular culture. The irony is large, because their last 8 tracks are barely even punk rock, made to get on the radio. Although I like songs like ""Greed"" ""My Own Country"" and ""My Own Way"", I think this band needs to stay true to their roots and not go mainstream."
5,I think that this is their best album!!!!!!,Pennywise has a great combination of guitar and vocals. They are a modern-rock band but they have good voices.
5,Great cd!,I bought this cd today knowing it would be great. I have just listened to it and I thought it was gnarly. I especially like track #7 Straight Ahead and track #1 Greed. Pennywise has preformed yet another spectacular cd with great beats and excitement. If you like Pennywise you should definently add this cd to your collection.
5,A great album from the best band in the world,"Well, I've been listening to Pennywise since '95 ( I live in Brazil, it was hard to find out good bands before the Internet...). This is not the best album from the band but I think if you like punk rock and have all the other ones from Pennywise you won't find anything better to buy. GO AND BUY IT!!!"
5,WOWEEEE!,"This CD is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! With Songs like alien, greed, and whatnot, Straight Ahead from Pennywise will keep you listening for A-G-E-S! Buy it-N-O-W!"
5,Not so dusty archaeology,Amazing art and sculptures from neolithic Europe. Worthy of Henry Moore. I would love to know where I could get replicas of the sorrowful god / goddess sculptures. Fascinating discoveries about the origins of the ancient greek religion. A must for anyone interested in European mythology
2,Don't expect eye appeal,"Neolithic art is, at best, dissapointing. Facial features weren't very important in the Neolithic and the statues shown uniformly have undersized little pinheads. Many have no recognizable facial features at all. With the modern emphasis on the human face, modern viewers will find little connection to these statues.Partially what determines form is the medium. Ceramic breaks when it falls. Top heavy statues fell to their destruction quickly, and people learned to make bottom heavy statues if they wanted them to last. Hence lots of photos of squat, bottom-heavy statues that sit stable on a shelf. No heads or arms, just enormous kneeling thighs for these paper weights. Many photos show the heads and arms broke off anyway.Those looking to be swept away by the mythic beauty of powerful goddesses will be disappointed. Those looking for Neolithic Europe as it really was will find it copiously filled with photographs and drawings."
3,Interesting,"When I finished John Henry Days I felt that I wanted to know more about the title character. The most interesting chapters in this book were the historical ones. What was John Henry really like, what about Lil Bob, was John Henry's wife really Polly? The excerpt on Paul Robeson was also interesting. As for J., I too like Pamela was wondering what the J stands for?"
2,In a word: wordy,"The perfect example of critics falling in love with excessive writing. Supposedly, the sentences Whitehead constructs are beautiful works of art, but I was always taught to keep things concise and precise so the reader could follow the story. Not so here. Whitehead tries to impress with his ability to use a thesaurus. I could forgive it if the characters or story itself were compelling, which they aren't. Whitehead is talented with good intentions, it's too bad critics don't try to steer him in the right direction."
2,fercrissake,"I got to the chapter with the Sepia Ladies Club and threw down the book in disgust. Yeah, Whitehead can write and no one's more impressed than he is. I don't know how many chapters litanize the bad behavior of fairgoers. One was enough, believe me. Now I'm supposed to get in the head of a whole 'nother set of characters (again), this time Mrs. Barden who should spend ""more time thinking about [her] daughter's carrying-on."" Probably this is all going somewhere, but I've lost interest. Too bad, too, because I was intrigued with J. -- and his potential transformation -- but he will always be a sad sack to me cause there's no way I'm gonna finish this book."
3,"Long, but OK","JHD is too long, and it sometimes takes too much of a byroad to return to the main narrative. There is much beauty in those byways, but by the time you get back to J. and Pamela, you feel you've travelled too far to be happy about your return, and the two characters don't grip you like they could or should. What made The Intuitionist such a great book - the detailled accounts - is this novel's main flaw."
3,I liked the Intuitionist better..,"This is good too, although it took me a long time to actually finish it. It sat on the desk beside my bed for a few months, and, despite my best intentions, I read a few different books during that time while slightly avoiding this one. This one is a bit long, and at times I wondered if he's the sort of writer that people like to own more than they like to read.But still, Whitehead is a force to be reckoned with. He writes like a white guy. There, I said it. More like Updike than Baldwin. That's what the hype is about. He's obviously a well read, educated brother that knows how to put words together. He throws up a fractured prism of thought and feedback and current from our culture. The result is quite interesting, although I'm sure this is not for everybody."
2,Not Compelling,"I have to agree with others here, this just isn't a great book. Some of the writing was inspired and creative, some was just contrived and for its own exposition, not the enhancement of the story. I never cared about any of the characters, with the exception of John Henry. I finished the book, but it wasn't compelling . . . I just wanted to complete what I started so I could get on to a better read, with the faint hope that I might be rewarded in the end. Unfortunately, I wasn't. Ah well, they can't all be a Franzen."
2,John Henry Days,"Frankly, I was disappointed in this book. Many of the reviews I read raved about it, but I found it laborious and disconnected. While there were many instances of some very good writing, the overall story, if there is one, gets lost in meanderings of J.. I enjoyed the passages about John Henry more than those about J. and his misadventures. Whether real or not, the John Henry stories tell of a real American hero."
2,Disappointing,"I can't believe this book got such great reviews. Whitehead is a very good writer and pretty damn funny in places, but this book doesn't have much heart to it and nothing that connects me with the characters. I'm to page 150 and am putting it down, hard as it is."
2,calyx,"Well written, but disconnected. By the time I got to the last few chapters I started skimming because they just didn't seem to have any relevance to the overall story. Chapters about nothing, just words to fill a page. Also, Whitehead seems very impressed with his ability to use adjectives, but to what end. I wouldn't waste my time..."
1,Really didn't like this book at all,I had to read this for a class. I just could not get into this story. I normally love to read but this book just could not cut it. I would not continue reading this book by choice. I will be glad to be done with it. The instructor could have picked a better book. No one else in the class cares for this book either. A waste of my money. J. is an annoying character. Couldn't care less about him....
1,Expensive Toilet Paper,"This piece of crap might be worth it, if I was in the woods and nature called.The whining, ignorant hillbilly and his gold digging wife just use the ranch and the kids as cover.They think that housing and feeding a few kids, for a couple of weeks, with other people money, will absolve them of their arrogant, greedy, lavish life style.Think again IMUS."
5,Magnificent Book,"My review is simply to express that this book has several meanings. It is truly an ""American"" book. The quality from the moment you touch it is so impressive. You open it and scan the beautiful pictures within. One is touched by their beauty. You begin to read and realize the kindness and the healing that goes forth. Then you find you are encouraged and motivated to change your style of eating and caring about the earth. I truly find this book to be one I choose to reach for many times and have it on my book shelf in my dining room. I will place it carefully so that the cover can be seen to remind my family and myself of its many special qualities.I hope the author will write many more books of this nature in the future. Perhaps it will help to bring ""quality"" back to the American lifestyle.Margaret"
1,Phony Book,"The absurdity of this book should be obvious since it's a vegetarian/ranch cookbook. Give me a break! A ranch exists to produce MEAT, which is what cowboys like to eat most. I cannot believe this book is a top seller unless Imus is buying the books himself, which would clearly be a possibility for a shameless self-promoter such as Imus. The Imus ranch is really all about Imus- what a phony."
2,After all it is for charity!,You do need help like the ranch does to whip up some of the meals in the book. I bought it mainly to help the ranch in its work. If you want a good meal there are a lot of better books out there.
5,Rating the BOOK not the Man,"I read about the book in Oprah's May 2004 issue of her magazine and thought interesting! So I bought it.I never gave Imus much thought EVER..based on merit alone..it's a great little book..part philosophy of helping others, part ecology, part cookbook. Recomended!! P.S. I've never read so many other reader reviews with an ax to grind about the author's husband (?) not the book."
2,Quit while your ahead,"Really John, Four Courners was a nice touch from the heart; but stop pushing your wifes causes out there, if she can't make it on her own, so be it. Stop pushing the ranch,(your later years settlement).; Your on your last day's(year's), so lay back and save the buck, not jerk your audiance. I stopped watching the TV showing when you started going out to the ranch in June and returning in Sept., with weeks off and, after one or two weeks on air you were off again So I switched my tv turn-on/alarm to the mystery station. Ciao"
5,Excelent,"I bought the book, read the articles, and cooked the food. Now I'm twenty five pounds lighter. Who could ask for more?"
3,Half of these aren't even reviews!,"Apparently Amazon doesn't screen people's reviews before they are posted. Does anyone at Amazon care that the ""reviews"" of this book are basically either personal attacks on the Imuses from people who know them personally, or glowing defenses of the Imuses, also apparently from personal acquaintances? As someone who does NOT know the Imuses, and who listens to the show occasionally and enjoys it, I would like to read some actual reviews of the BOOK. Unfortunately, there are very few here.Amazon, you should delete the ""reviews"" that aren't really reviews-- all of them, including this one."
5,A Great Way to Help!,"I pre-ordered this book when I heard about it on Don Imus' morning program. I knew that the Imus family followed a vegetarian diet and I was interested in learning more about it for myself and my family.I just received the book this week so I'm still reading and learning, but so far I have found it to be very informative - not only for the vegan regimen, but for insight into the ranch activities.Pictures of beautiful New Mexico, stories about the inception of the ranch and from the parents and especially the children, interesting recipes and ""all author revenues from the book go to the Imus Cattle Ranch for Kids with Cancer"". The last bit says it all!"
5,Cooking for Kids and Cowboys,"Fabulous book. Great job Dierdre ! What a fabulous cause. You and your husband have created a beautiful place for beautiful children, and should be commended for all your tireless efforts.The book, by the way, is the best !!!!"
1,Yoko Redux,"It makes me sick to think of how many trees were chopped down for this piece of self-indulgent fluff! The recipes are mundane and not worth the purchase. The pictures are sub-par. This book would never get published if this woman was not Don Imus's wife. Please spare us any more of your wife's ""career."""
1,Unbelievable!,"This book is a testimony to incredible hubris and the laudable feat of being able to send 150 very sick young kids each year to a cattle ranch, all for the paltry sum of $3 million per annum. A fringe benefit is that Imus gets to provide employment for all his neer-do-well relatives and bore his dwindling radio audience with tedious self-congratulatory monologues about this ranch. Only in America, with outdated not-for-profit tax regulations!"
1,NOT a Cookbook,"I couldn't care less about the radio show, the ranch or as Larry King called them ... The Bickersons! I thought I was buying a cookbook. That's how it's being advertised. The ""recipes"" are a joke. Save your money folks."
1,The Imus Ranch...Vacation home for a wannabe cowboy,"Is there a more self-promoting couple anywhere in the world than Don and ""DeeDee"" Imus? Do they really think the good work they do for a FEW kids each year justifies the millions spent by others to provide Don, Deirdre and their rude, spoiled brat with their own family resort? They expect everyone else to pay for their fun, and Don scolds his audience when we don't contribute to his private Neverland ranch. How much does Fred Imus earn from these donations? How stupid do you think we are, I-man? And yes, we DO ""get it."" I applaud the experiences you provide A FEW kids each year, but don't expect us to swallow your baloney about this entire project being ""just for the poor kids."" It is a lavish, gorgeous resort for you, your child bride, your brother, and your obnoxious brat."
1,The Photographs in this Book are Very Nice!,"Although the photographs in this book are very nice, the book itself was printed on an inexpensive grade of paper too porous to attractively showcase the photo images."
1,I fell asleep reading this book!,"Yesterday, after listening to Don Imus spew forth and foam at the mouth about this book, I bit the bait, fell for the line, and I bought this book.Today, I fell asleep reading this boring book!Tomorrow, I am going to return this book and get my money back.A lot of the recipe titles do not make sense. Who is this Butch? Why do his pancakes appear in this book? Was he fired along with the rest of the 200 people Deirdre smears in the book? Is this why there is no definition preceding the pancake recipe as to who he is?There are so many recipes like this! This book lacks personality.Also, there is a scarecity of protein dishes in this book. No wonder Don is always sick and pasty looking.Where did Mrs. Imus find these recipes? What will happen to this ranch after Don Imus retires?"
3,"okay but not great,","I thought for the most part that this book was okay, a few different food ideas, but I expected a lot more. Still doable. Okay, but not great!"
1,"OHHHH, WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT","A very attractive book with not much content except (a) some ""difficult-to-prepare in the real world"" recipies that aren't that good and (b)another shameless Imus family self-promotion exercise. I'm sure Deirdre is very sincere, but perhaps someone who's actually had a real job in their lifetime could have provided her some tips for those of us who don't have time or staff. Hope she trys again, though. (Sorry I wrote this anon., but I don't need the I-man sending Bo Dietl to my door to have a ""talk""!!)"
4,The Bigger Picture,"I am such a big I-fan that I'm able to tune him out when the book/ranch/salsa flogging and self-promotion get unbearable.I bought the book to support the ranch, but it's pretty tough to buy the Imus environmental mission (organic vegan diet, the greening of homes and hospitals etc.) when the unprecedented toxic environmental policies of the Bush administration seem to escape the Imus radar. What a pity!"
2,"Review the book, not the ranch, not Imus","It's really not helpful or in the spirit of book reviews for all of these entries that say ""I love Imus"" or ""Isn't the ranch wonderful"".This review is about the book. It's a disappointment.While the actual book is physically beautiful, and therefore it gets more than one star, from a content perspective, it is amateur.First, the recipes. It's called ""Cooking"" but the recipes are sparse, difficult to follow, and unimaginative.Second, the text. It's overly saccharine, full of puerile humor, and quite self-congratulatory.If you want to donate to the Ranch, just send them a check.But you can see from the quick spike up and then drop of this title on the amazon.com list, that there must have been bulk buying by I-Man's friends, as well as pent-up demand from the four hours of radio marketing by Imus for the past six weeks.Send the money direct. You'll never use this book."
1,an inside view,"I have been to the Imus ranch, and the food is terrible. And if the food is terrible, why buy the book? The Imus ranch is a poster cause established by the Imuses to pay for their summer vacation. The children are used basically as day laborers, and forced to eat vegan food. At one point i had to landscape their front yard with the mexicans. And to top it all off, the cooks are given no credit and looked down apon in the book. The three who are said to have abandoned them were in fact mistreated, and I was there when they left. Deirdre has gone as far as to log everything her son ever eats...theyre crazy. Please do not support the Imuses."
2,Buy It To Help The Kids - The book is drivel.,"Nice pictures, especially of Dierdre Imus in jeans. The writing is out of Oprah and the recipes are enough to gag a vegan maggot. Buy it to help the Imus Ranch but re-sell it with the proceeds going to the ranch. I have my copy for sale on Amazon now."
1,"If the cause is good, the methods must be good as well.",I listen to the Stern show but I am an independent thinker who heard Chef Ron this morning and am not influenced by Stern's opinion alone. The guy has obviously worked on these recipes for years and deserves to get credit for the work he put into them. Mr. and Mrs. Imus have a responsibility towards the children they are helping to display compassion as well as honesty. Supporting a worthy cause by dishonesty and manipulative methods does the cause a misservice and paints you as a publicity charlatan.
3,Less chatter,There are good vegetarian recipes in this book. I like the idea that they give you a feel for the ranch and some of the stories are very good although they get to be the same old same old by the end of the book. I would have liked more recipes and less chatter.
4,vegan lifestyle,"Good selection of vegan recipes for anyone wanting to test a vegetarian lifestyle. For those who want information about ""green"" cleaning and living there are pages at various points with helpful information. A little too much infomercial for the ranch but that is probably to be expected as it is was written to be a fundraiser."
5,Another great book by Deirdre Imus!,"This is another great book by Deirdre Imus. The story in the front of the book before the recipes is great and the recipes are yummy and can easily be altered with different ingredients that we all have on hand if you wanted to. Im looking forward to cooking them. Also check out her book called GREEN THIS. The best book ive ever read on green cleaning. You wont be dissapointed in either of these books! Thanks Deirdre Imus your books are the greatest! I have bought so many books in the past that I was dissapointed with but not her books. You wont be dissapointed and you cant go wrong, the profits go to The Imus Ranch for the kids with cancer."
1,Imus Ranch cooking for kids and cowboys,"I found the recipes to be difficult for a busy lifestyle. Perhaps if one has the staff of the Imus ranch it would be easier. Also, after all the time spent, the entrees were dull and insipid."
1,Book Review,"I love cookbooks-the recipes,pictures & the author's take on cooking.I was disappointed with this book's recipes-kind of dull, but what really disappointed me was one of the first essays in the book about cooks.I have never heard of a cookbook author that speaks so disparagingly about cooks.That lack of respect is a turn-off for those of us who like to cook and/or work in the food industry.I'm glad I made a contribution to their charity but I gave the book to my mom to sell at her yard sale."
2,Book too expansive to be effective,"Most of the legitimate criticisms of this book (not the personal attacks, no matter how true) are on target. Deirdre Imus has combined a cookbook with essays and beautiful photographs, but the end result fails.If the focus of The Imus Ranch had been food, this could have worked. As has been pointed out, there are some contradictions in the recipes, primarily in the uses of ingredients that aren't healthy choices. Recipes can be tweaked, of course, and this isn't necessarily fatal.The main problem is the book is way too expansive. Although the best cookbooks make good use of the author's narrative, the ruminations ultimately wander back to the main focus, food. That doesn't happen here effectively. In fact, there are points when the narrative degenerates into a rant and then a second rant follows.After suffering through The Imus Ranch, I'm still not sure what it is. I know what it isn't: a cookbook."
3,Cooking for Cowboys?,"How many cowboys do you know who are vegetarians? Can you imagine John Wayne or Gary Cooper as vegetarians? Don't make me laugh! Deirdre Imus would have been smart to actually make this a cookbook for kids and cowboys, not for vegans.Don Imus needs to stand up to his wife and eat some meat. I saw Imus and his wife on Larry King the other night and he looked like a dead man propped up - pale and pasty. I tape the Imus shows in the mornings to watch later. It seems like he and his wife get sick alot. Deirdre is still reasonably young and can get away with eating this wacky diet. But Don, please, for heaven's sake, eat some steak!"
1,Amazing,"Amazing...that someone can build their dream getaway all with other peoples money and some of their own tax deductuble dollors, and justify it with having some very derserving children fly out a few, very few, weeks a year...amazing !If this was so heartfelt and philanthropic, then Imus should just keep his month shut... we`ve heard enough."
2,vegetarian cookbook for meat eaters???? infomercial,"Is there anything Imus won't do or say to sell books?1. Vegetarian recipes rarely work when you add meat and sadly these recipes are no exceptions, despite what Imus keeps saying.2. If Imus is really doing so much for sick kids, then great but why did he name it after himself and why did he make that poor injured little boy ""get back on the horse"" instead of getting him medical help?3. Big-name guests and journalists are desperate to get on his show but now that he plugs this book r-e-l-e-n-t-l-e-s-s-l-y his show is unwatchable. It has become nothing but an infomercial.He sounds like that former morning co-host on what's turned out to be a great show since her replacement with a younger (and talented) co-host.True philanthropists don't name their good works after themselves. Please Imus: good work is one thing, but this book is yet another way to boost your name and ego.Help the kids and not yourself!"
2,"Nice pictures, uninteresting recipes","The Imus ranch is a fine project, but I was very dissapointed in the recipes, and the text was very uncreative. Buy the book for the photos and to help the Ranch, forget the awful cooking."
1,Poorly written recipes and text.,"I love to collect cookbooks!!Sometimes, I buy a cookbook because the recipes in the book are tantilizing to read, and when reading them I am inspired to make them.At other times, I buy a cookbook because the prose leading up to the recipes is informative and interesting.This book scores a big fat zero on both counts.Maybe Deirdre Imus should stick to writing about things she knows best. Maybe she should write a book on ""How I Married Well, and What I am Doing Now to Milk the Stupid S.O.B. and All of His Media contacts."""
1,A waste of money,"This lifestyle comes from a family of rich people totally out of touch with the real world, Where the guy is always sick.Maybe he should just control is portions and eat more real food.I would like to know is opinion of the same book back in the days when he was shoving coke up his nose and booze down is throat by the kilo and gallon."
4,"Great For Haircuts, Not So For Beards","My Wahl beard trimmer crapped out after 5 years of use so I bought this as a replacement because I could not find my original beard trimmer. I used it once and it worked fine, but is a bit unwieldly because it's so large. It did a decent job but didn't have a Number 0 (zero) clip for triming my head hair (the Wahl did). Eventually I found a replacement for my Wahl and bought that one. So - warning - don't be too quick to buy a replacement that may not do the job."
3,very good try...,"An interesting criticism, by a Charismatic Christian, of the more rediculous tendencies and practices within the Charismatic movement, pointing instead back to the the importance of 1.) keeping the Gospel central (and not the 'gifts' of the Spirit) through 2.) re-appropriating many historic traditions of the Church. Yes, it's a hard read. Yes, Stackhouse at times seems a bit TOO critical. At the same time, the message IS an important one, and when he hits the nail on the head, he his it's hard and drives it ALL the way in. A worthy read, even if not very entertaining."
4,study of bible.,"doing a study of the bible and at present up to the book of Luke. He being the only gentile mentioned or the rest are jews, so this gospel of luke by william Barclay came in very handy Kia Ora Graham."
3,Not for fundamentalist,"This author offers good historical and cultural context to Luke. If you believe that the Bible is the perfect word of God without error, you may be very unhappy with this commentary.Although the author does offer some nice theological insight, these insights are blended with some horrifying not so subtle hints at paganism and questions of accuracy of Luke's gospel."
3,Finally! Took me forever to find this!,"I bought this tape when it was released in '94. At the time, my mom was going thru a chrisian phase, so that's the music i got. i didn't really like it at first; i was about 7 or 8, and i was more used to the airy stylings of madonna and the j. geils band. they are HARD CORE. imagianary music (i know i misspelled that, & i don't give a damn) is the best song on the album, and dying day is pretty catchy as well. i would recommend this, simply because it is unique. if you ever come across this lp in a used cd store, i'd advise u to buy it - it's a rare record, well worth at least one listen."
5,Best Translation of the Qur'an I've read,"I have five different translations of the Qur'an at home, and this is the best in conveying the meaning of the Qur'an. The poetry and rhythm of the Qur'an is absent here, and Asad himself says that he makes no attempt to try to capture that at all. So in reading this, realize that the real Qur'an is in unmetered verse, often rhyming, and thrilling in its accents. But if you want the meaning of the verses, this is excellent. It's modern, easy to read, reasonable and scholarly in its explanatory footnotes, and it makes more sense to the modern Western mind than any other translation. In contrast to Dawood's translation (by far the worst), Asad tells you not only the meaning of the words, but the context, and the way the verse should be read against the background of the entire Qur'an. It's expensive, but really really worth getting."
5,The Glorious Quran,"Mr. Asad's mastery of multiple languages ( Hebrew, Arabic, English, German and French) and his JudeoChristian BACKGROUND gives him the unique ability to expound on The quranic texts unlike other translators I have come across ( I routinely consult 4 other translations when I study the Quran ). His work desereves 10 stars!!"
5,Stop thinking,"This is an extra ordinary work. Examining the Quran from the perspective of a lawyer, I found this transaltion and commentary clarified areas of law which I had always found problematic. Furthermore, aspects of the Quran which have always seemed somewhat archaic to modern readers are placed in context and explained with the result that its status as a truely timeless book rises to the surface. If you are intersted in Islam or in buying a Quran just stop thinking right now and buy this book."
5,Outstanding scholarship !,"Muhammad Asad's translation and commentary of the Qur'aan must be regarded as simply the best. His understanding of the classical idiom of arabic( mastered while living with bedoins) has corrected many of the hostile interpretations given to Islam by western orientalists, or even worse, by misguided Muslim scholars through the centuries. A champion of women's rights, he gives a breath of fresh air to Muslims understanding of several verses on the socio political laws of Islam. He has been critisized as being a mu'tazilah, mainly by groups who wish to preserve the status quo in Islamic thinking.He has made some mistakes in his translation of the scientific verses of the Qur'aan, but in some cases is even better than Maurice Bucaille's. This book need to be read in conjuction with ""The principles of state and government in Islam"", to get a better understanding of Islam, by Muslims and non Muslims."
2,Disappointed with the Kindle Version,"I love Muhammad Asad's translatiom of the Quran, but disappointed with the Kindle version. It is obvious that it wasn't formated for Kindle. The footnotes which in my opinion are an important part of this translation do not work and neither does the table of content."
5,The best translation I have read so far,"The Quran has been translated many times, by Dawood, by Ali, but this one is the best I have read so far. Anyone interested in a truly great translation and commentary, get Asad."
5,Great Product,This is the best Qur'an translation out there for English speaking Muslims. MashaAllah. It is amazing. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE.
3,There is hope...,"The reason I gave this Kindle book 3 stars is simply because the most important part of the book (the footnote commentaries) is not included. However, for the price it is expected. In addition, the Arabic and transliterations are not included. A free alternative to this (although it doesn't have the the Arabic nor transliteration but does include the footnotes) is:[...]Enjoy."
2,The Message of the Qur'an,"First of all, I had heard that this Quran by Muhammad AsadThe Message of the Qur'anwould be an excellent addition for any student studying the Quran and getting a more accurate translation of the arabic. I was really looking forward in reading and studying the arabic, but I found that the arabic script (although beautifully written) was just too small to read. As big as the book is, I really expected a much larger arabic script and the english translation would be secondary. I was really disappointed about that because I wanted to practice reading but have the english translation and a english/arabic dictionary as a helper. In addition, the binding was already torn away from the pages when I received it and the corner of the hardback was bend. It was not at all what I expected."
3,Irwin 3018004 Drill Bit Set,"Great Drill Bits. The case leaves a bit to be desired, but otherwise a good auality Drill bit set!"
3,Not Bad!!,"I purchased two sets of these and just received them now. Both the boxes have a spring mechanism to open and close the cases. Both of mine broke when opened-Poor Design!! As for the drill bits, I have not used them yet but they look very durable and professional. Not a cheap set. I paid 19.99 each last week. Watch as the price fluctuates a lot!!"
3,Compelling and unique,"A fascinating and unique documentary about twins, one gay and one a transgendered. The hardships that both of them have to go through in dealing with life and with developing romantic relationships and friendships with their family and among themselves are worth watching. This movie makes a heterosexual person who is happy in her skin realize how good she has it and how confusing and difficult it is for someone who isn't in today's society. It's impossible to imagine how much harder it must be for a twin, one of a whole to deal with the entire issue. This movie is an interesting study into one's family struggle and the coming of realization that they are a family and the only thing that matters is that they must stick together through better or worse."
3,Sony CMT-DV2D,"We have just taken the components out of the box & set them on our 10"" shelves, as the dimensions listed the unit @ 9.75 X 10"" X 7.5""... imagine our dismay to find the receiver has a fan AND another add-on to the back which requires a shelf at least 12""!!We have yet to finish unpacking, as we're PISSED."
1,Fair product / Lousy customer support,"After days of frustration - and with little help from the customer support department at Izotope - I was finally able to get this product to funtion properly. I was unable to change the rating above, but in fairness, I will give this product three stars. For the money, it does quite a bit. My main useage is to bring up, or ""maximize"" the levels of my final mixes which Ozone 3 does fairly well, but not quite as good as the comparable Waves L1. Izotope needs to address its customer support department. No one should have to be on hold for an hour and then be disconnected at their closing time as I was."
4,Solid and lightweight.,"As a college student, I wanted a backpack that has both style and rugged functionality. This backpack offers both, TNF is a staple in quality and collegiate/ outdoor style. The backpack is a bit small compared to other Northface products. There are only two main compartments, and the padding is a bit scant.However I say it is still worth the buy by far. The structure of the backpack is sound and the colors are very well done. Logos and easily manipulated zippers make this a great choice for college kids."
5,Great product....,very durable backpack. Great for school. 3 of my 4 kids use this backpack and are very satisfied. Two are in high school one in jr high.
4,son said no complaints,son uses item for shool materials and other items while on the go.hok hasnt complained so i guess item's ok.
5,Northface Backpack,If you want to buy a backpack that lasts a long time do not go any further. I have had my backpack since freshman year in highschool and now I am a freshman in college and it still looks brand new. I use it for almost everything. Its material is so durable/longolasting and waterproof for those rainy days. Logical speaking if you buy a pack back that will last you 5+ years then buying one every year you're saving a lot of money then buying a cheap 20 dollar back pack every single year. Buy the Backpack!
3,Fast senders,I ordered this bag and it was sent very fast. I like the color and its true to looks. I like everything about this pack except the back needs some breaking in. The back is very hard and not very comfy to boat like that so i recommend breaking it in before heavy use.
5,Kid Recipes,We all enjoy learning something new and this book of recipes has been really fun. My whole family will enjoy using it.
3,Just what the title says...,"This cookbook delivers what the title says: Kid Favorites Made Healthy. So if you want to make healthier chicken nuggets, macaroni and cheese, chili, tacos, banana bread, etc., then this cookbook is a great choice. I was looking more for full menu ideas that would appeal to my 7 and 4 year olds. There is one chapter for Dinner, and one for kid-friendly vegetables, but the rest are breakfast, snacks, lunch, desserts, and party ideas - not what I needed. If you have an overweight child, or are worried that one is heading in that direction, then you should get this. Tasty recipes made healthy, and exercise and nutrition info too!"
2,Disappointing,"This book has very nice pictures of the food and fun recipe names but it is not useful. With recipes like Pineapple Coleslaw (ewww) and Sparkling Stars (make just like Jello wigglers) I was not impressed. The ""made healthy"" part is mostly using low fat or non fat ingredients, not really substituting healthier things while still tasting good. I am returning and getting the Sneaky Chef. I gave Sneaky Chef as a Christmas present and my friend calls everyday telling me about the great recipes she has made for her family how they ""ate it up!"""
1,Simplistic,"If you like pretty pictures of everyday foods with a slight twist this is for you. If you want creativity, lower calories, foods that use purees then get the Sneaky Chef books. I returned this book."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Hurt by a glum-looking Oskar Werner (he apparently was feuding with Truffaut during filming) as Montag and the bizarre stunt casting of Julie Christie in both lead female roles, this movie adaptation of Bradbury's novel fails to deliver in any meaningful way."
2,"Doesn't deserve title of ""451""","As a movie....it is average. This is not a movie I would use with students because the ""future"" still looks very 60's-like.Also, the story-line has been changed drastically to the point that it does't fit the book (as a result..shouldn't be 451).The movie also misses some critical points of the book....nuclear war and Montag's loss of mildred/linda..as well as other points of interest in the book.For its time, it was probably good, but it is very outdated and should/could be filmed again with use of better effects. Keep in mind...this book takes place post 2000....needed more imagination about the future and less 60's/Brady Bunch style."
3,"Not a bad movie, but....","...the main virtue of this film is that it will encourage people to read the late Ray Bradbury's brilliant and all-too-prophetic novel. The motion picture makes a nice try at conveying the themes, but it gets sidetracked.By all means, read the book."
1,farenheit 451,I can't play the DVD because it was made with the wrong country code! so VCRs and Blue Ray players won't recognize the DVD...how do i return it!??
2,Pretty dull,"I was bored stiff by this. I'm sure the classic novel upon which this is based is vastly better, and full of allegorical meanings. But this early 60s sci-fi got pretty quiet in places, and the production looks very cheap by modern standards. They did manage to get the look of modern flat screen TVs uncannily well, don't you think? People are actually still staring at those flat-screens today, just as the novel projected they would when books disappear. The dialogue and acting are wooden throughout. Be prepared for an artistic experience, just not a very entertaining one."
3,Uninspiring,"Plodding, sometimes boring film. A couple of good sequences, but generally not spectacular in its effect on mind and body. See it if you liked the book and want to see an interpretation, but otherwise, don't bother."
4,Fahrenheit 451,"The movie was done well, and followed the essence of the book. However The ""hound"" was left out of the movie...not a good idea. Although the ending for both were similar in intent, they had pertinent differences that need not have occurred. Both were enjoyed by me, and make for good discussion."
4,Truffaut Versus Bradbury.,"Set in a future where books and all literature are banned and seen as a subversive influence. Firemen are employed to burn these illegal texts (farenheit 451 being the temperature at which paper catches fire), rather than extinguish burning buildings etc. Not Francois Truffaut's best film by a long way, but nevertheless an interesting interpetation of Ray Bradbury's classic science fiction story. This should have been a emotional experience but Truffaut's understated style doesn't quite work. Some scenes are impressive (such as the old woman in her house set alight by herself, happy to be burned to death with her illegal books rather than live on without them). Photographed by Nicolas Roeg, Music by Bernard Herrmann."
2,"not oddly intriguing, just odd","Many years ago, I wrote a book report on this Lame movie adaptation of a great book. It was pretty low-budget, and didn't follow the story well enough for me to like it. I still remember a Montag afraid of *the firepole*, and the cheap hover machines on strings swooping down after him. Two stars for at least ripping off a good plot in the first place."
2,Bleak and oblique.,Its an ok premise but its the weirdness that comes through more than anything else. And its oh so slow.
3,Flawed yet Visionary,"Francois Truffaut's only English language film, based on the Ray Bradburry novel deals with a future where the mere fact of owning books is a crime and firemen enter and search houses to eliminate any work of literature; anything from ""Lolita"" to issues of ""Cahiers du Cinema."" I thought this was a great, impressive film. The way Truffaut envisioned the future (even though somewhat dated by today's standards) was eerily on the money. The power and influence of television over what we think and do is evident here. The performances by Oskar Werner and Julie Christie (in a dual role) were just right; detached individuals who serve as a prototype of what our society indeed has become."
3,"Worth seeing, but hardly a blockbuster","As with so many science fiction novels that are translated into film, this version of F451 follows most of the plot points of Bradbury's novel but, in my opinion, alters the themes significantly. However, in the final analysis, this is a movie worth seeing -- just brace yourself for the lackadaisical, French-art house style and Oskar Werner's tenuous grasp of English."
5,"Oskar Werner, Franois Truffaut and Bernard Herrmann","Any film that has Oskar Werner in the lead, is directed by Franois Truffaut and has a score by Bernard Herrmann has to make one sit up and take notice. Taken from Ray Bradbury's futuristic novel Truffaut's outlook is still not entirely satisfying for those who choose to read as Herrmann's music seems to underscore. The images remain haunting."
1,Terribly Dated,"It's time they made another updated movie version of this great book, because this movie version is terribly dated. I'm a teacher and I found this movie wouldn't even hold the attention of my 10th graders when we were studying the book.And another thing which mystifies me: Why did they pick an actor with a THICK German or some other undecipherable accent to lead? I don't get that.The special effects in this movie are almost non-existent (they simply cut out most of the parts in the book which would've required special effects, like the mechanical dog)."
3,Movie good - ending so-so,"Based on the legendary book, the movie does a good job in depicting the not-too-distant future in which in books are banned and firemen are used to enforce the ban by burning books.The society is presented as facist, with children reciting their multiplication tables in an emotionless, almost mechanical manner, people learning self-defense on massive, almost monstrous television screens, or the public gleefully laughing as police forcefully give one of those ""long haired sooty intellectual types"" a haircut.Regretfully, it loses its ""fire"" at the end. While the book ends with World War III (or is it IV?) breaking out, the movie ends with the hero in a commune of free thinkers, and a boy learning a story.Like the movie Gattaca of later years, though, I will say Fahrenheit 451 offers an intriguing view of what could be."
5,Librarians are the heroes!,"A wonderfully scary movie about a world in which books are not allowed. This classic Ray Bradbury story is thrilling, thought-provoking, and very well acted."
3,It was just alright,"If I hadn't read the actual book, I probably would have given it a better rating. The movie leaves out many great parts that are in the book. Julie Christie does a great job."
5,Oldie but goody,"A movie version of Ray Bradbury novel of a restristed society that banned books ""for our own good"". People are given drugs to make them feel good all the time (like Prozac and other drugs now).It's an excellent movie and considering where we seem to be heading, a timely movie to watch.BTW, I found it interesting that a TV called a ""Wallscreen"" looks identical to today's HDTVs!"
4,She does it Okay on this one,Here follow up single is not as good as Fallin but it is prettygood she does okay here I will say thumbs up.Lyrics 7/10 Production 7/10 Overall 7/10
5,American History and Domestic Animals,"Humans are so arrogant that they write histories -- and current events-- as if they alone are responsible for what happens. They ignore the incredible contributions that dogs, and later, horses, have made to the sweep of history. Without them, history as we know it, wouldn't have occurred. That is easy enough to prove, but this book considers other animals as well, such as cattle and pigs. I was astonished to discover that so much of the colonists' and later Americans' treatment of Native Americans hinged upon the differing attitudes of each culture to domesticated animals. Also, Native Americans were often displaced because of the settlers' needs for grazing their herds. This book is very interesting and provides an original perspective on the settlement of The New World and its concomitant destruction of the Native peoples that the Europeans found here."
3,"Slow, but interesting","The author tends to be a bit repetitious, but the subject matter is interesting for anyone interested in the early colonial period, particularly the relationship between white colonists and Native Americans."
5,Great,Hard to put down. The author really researched this book. It gives you a whole new slant on the 1600s. The differences between New England and the Chesapeake were brought out in length. We started lieing to the natives long before the mid-1800s.
3,Creatures of Empire: How Domestic Annimals Transformed Early America,This was fascinating. A new take on the factors that influenced the settlement and eventual domination of the New World by the English. A good addition to our store of knowledge for those of us who like history/non-fiction.
2,"Interesting Concept, Tedious Execution","I purchased this book because I love reading about history from different perspectives. I guess I was hoping for a Bill Bryson-esque treatment. This book is very academic and while it would undoubtedly be useful for someone doing a research project, it doesn't work as a purely educational read. The theses is very straightforward and the bulk of the book is composed of dry anecdotes and lists of names and dates. I gave up after reading 2/3 of it."
2,Not for XP,"The game info includes XP compatible, but not for the all the games. When you go to test the vehicle that you fixed up, the screen goes black and all you can see is your vehicle. There are a few other areas that don't work all the way. My five-year old loves the game, but is very frustrated that he can't do everything. There is no technical support from anyone as the game is too old."
5,This one will blow you away!,"Contains most songs from Liberator Singles *and* EPs (Freedom Fighters and Carefully Blended).To date it's still one of my favorites and given that Carefully Blended is in my opinion completely underrated and one of my favorite works *of all time*, Soundchecks is a must-have. Get this in addition to the This Is and Worldwide Delivery albums, and you're all set!Lib On!"
5,Old School Fan from New York,"I have been following Beltram's work since he started in the 80's and he has never let me down. This is definetly at the forefront of any mix CD's out there. The tracks are brilliantly chosen and mixed to perfection. If you know your music this is a ""must have"" in your collection."
4,"for the body, not the mind","I think this is a very good cd in that in does what it intends, capturing the dancefloor feel. I think of it as a home listening cd designed to make you feel ""not at home"" In that regard like a lot of electronic music, it's ultimate danceability becomes more important than the ability of the songs to be considered great."
1,put it back on the shelf or trade,"from a no start, to a worse finish. Joey, please pick the same tracks you would at a party. No real getting down tracks that we are used to."
1,"Don't buy it,, I'll sell you my copy for a buck .",I can use the buck to save for a copy of the next DB mix.
1,Series never completed by Clemens,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series, as well as Clemen's previous Witch War series.Don't buy any of the books though, as has been previously stated - he's too busy churning out book after book under his James Rollins pen name to bother to finish what he started"
4,Can't wait for the rest of the series...,"I admit, I haven't had time recently to read very much...but this book happened to catch my eye (considering I am not familiar with the author's other books)...I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline, and I am looking forward to the follow-up books...personally, I'd like to find out more about Pupp...If the book synopsis sounds interesting to you, I would highly recommend picking up a copy..."
2,So Disappointed!,I loved loved LOVED the Banned and the Banished series and could not wait to get my hands on Shadowfall. Did the same person write both series? Not only is the premise based on the five humours ridiculous not to mention nasty I really didn't care about the characters. I hope the next series is more similar to the Banned and the Banished.
2,Interesting but not Captivating,"The other reviews have given the reader the basic plot of the book: dishonored knight misidentified as the slayer of a god, is given her powers, thus becoming the one who will rescue the lands from the dark plans currently at work. The gods themselves are classical Greek in their general character, able to mate with one another and with humans. They display the same interest as the Greek and Roman deities in messing around in human affairs. They are immortal in the same limited sense that the classical deities were.The Shadowknights, as another reviewer has commented, are not well-defined in this opening novel. They remain, as it were, shadows.Ultimately, I found the work disappointing. The characters were more chessmen moved around on the board than characters that captured the imagination and interest of the reader. Perhaps the strongly-worded blurbs from John Saul amd R. A. Salvatore led me to expect more than I should have. I will not read more of the series."
3,"good book, relatively speaking","I throughly enjoyed Clemens's Witch War books so I looked forward to this book very eagerly. I'm very well-read in fantasy, so I can say that Clemens's plot is unique. A dishonored knight is accused of killing a god. All evidence conclusively points to his being the murderer, including from the now-deceased god herself.Clemens focuses so much on bodily fluids that I found it somewhat offputting. Nevertheless, I gave the second book, Hinterlands a chance and enjoyed that as well."
1,"Don't start, he won't finish","I love the series but if you notice, he wrote these in 2006 and hasn't done anything since. I don't think there is any intent to finish this trilogy so don't waste your money reading a story only half written."
2,Life is Short,"Life is too short to read books of this caliber, and I am simply not engaged in this story after 50 pages and am giving up. While there is nothing wrong with the writing, the story is not compelling, believable or anything other than boring. Not for me!"
4,I saw it in a theater,"I even bought the book this movie was based on. I was not interested in entertainment values (soul mulch) as in an idea; American GREATNESS IS LARGELY AN EXCUSE FOR STILL MOPPING UP. In 1967, when this movie was in theaters, it hardly seemed likely that America would give me Vietnam and Cambodia as an opportunity to kill or be killed in, but I was ready to seek a winning attitude in spite of whatever years might bet my life on a different outcome. Now that literary life is on a par with indoor plumbing for most people, this movie looks like a real plum for a sense of humor out to meet a sense of monstrosity."
4,Good job!,Item arrived in reasonable amount of time and was in the condition described on the vendors page. Right on!
4,beatle john,"how I won the war is a funny movie,with John Lennon[Beatles]and Michael Crawford[frank Spencer]making fun of army life.I don't know ..its not Monty python"
4,Anti-Military movie needs recognition,I don't know how much of an anti-military movie this is vs an anti-war movie. Perhaps they are one and the same. For Beatles fans I think they know that this is Mister Crawford's movie and not Beatle John's and they will enjoy seeing him in it as long as they don't blink. Crawford gives a great performance as an officer who bends and doesn't break to the military demands of an officer as we see in the end. You just have to sit through it.
2,Confusing but fruitful,"Not as funny as the advertisements make it sound, there are good things to be gleaned from this film if you hang on till the end. The footage from wars and older movies adds something to the new film, and there are several moments that make you cry and a few that just give you a good feeling. Overall the film is not too gory, and is pathetic in a way that makes one understand the actors' feelings about the futility of the Vietnam War. It's pretty necessary to view the movie at least twice to understand most of it. Michael Crawford (Phantom of the Opera) is good but immemorable in the lead role; John Lennon isn't as bad as the critics would have you believe, but is not in the film enough to make a purchase worthwhile to Lennon or Beatles fans."
4,"just put them under the taps,luv","Wasn't it St. Anna who said, ""those who forget old movies are condemned to have a minor part in the remake""? Obviously the crew who brought us Iraq never saw this film. I've been waiting for years to see this again [having been disappointed by how badly Oh What a Lovely War! was dated] and it was worth the wait. Hard to remember this was before Monty Python, before Ricky Gervais, when Richard Lester just meant a bunch of floppy mops running around London [and Robert Hardy had just a bit part]And, yes, Mr. Ebert, I do remember Lennon on the cover of Ramparts, but it didn't dilute the films impact then or now. Watch this as an antiwar movie like All Quiet or Strangelove, or watch it as a surreal black comedy - ""just put them under the taps,luv ""- or just try to absorb it at all levels. It worked then [rememeber, in 1967, the NY Times, among other liberal voices, was just beginning to realize what Vietnam was doing to us. ] and it works now"
5,"Lester's ""How I Won the War""","Excellent film! Not about the John Lennon icon, the Beatles (""I don't believe in . . .""), popular music, or much else in the way of escapist diversion. It reminds me of Spike Milligan's ""Mussolini"" and "" Hitler"" ""Downfall"" works - and there's a reason for this: Lester (a younger cohort of Milligan) was an eight-year old kid during the blitz. For anyone who was in THAT molar-grind of remote-controlled war, how do you process that?Our lives and bodies will be lucky if the response - from those who've been hurled into teeth of the current (2008) global nihilist feeding frenzy - is a satire as sublime as ""How I Won the War."" You'll bust a gut - and it may be a vital organ, like your liver, or somewhere to the north, or south, or east, or west of there.Now if I could just get a Region 1 version of this for my US DVD player."
5,Strudel Stories,"I would give this book 5 stars because it is heart warming and once you start reading, it hooks you in and you will always want to know what happens next! It's a great book, awsome to re-read and I read it TWICE!This book is about a Jewish Familly telling stories about their family history. Some of the stories inside are: The boy who danced with Ghosts, The greatest baseball moment ever, The forbidden apple tree, Willy's Kitchen, Sarah's kitchen, Baby Lily, and Ghost for the second time. (Not to mention the Almost-a-disaster day.) The book shows a family over seven generations, and almost one hundred years. The family goes through WWI, WWII, Immagration, and personal disasters. My favorite story was The Boy who hated strudel and all the shorter stories that connected to it. This great story also included Grandpa Willy's Awesome Strudel recipe. (I can't wait to make it and eat it!) This is one of my favorite books! Like I said, I read it Twice!"
1,Bad bad product.,"Item sucks, do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!! Does not come with power cord or anything.No instructions as to what voltage it accepts, very low quality plastic."
4,Good,"This is a fun book to read. If you are looking for evidence of Sheba's existance than most of this book will be useless to you, but where it does provide evidence, it is very good and original, at least evidence I wasn't aware of.There was one thing I didn't like, he talked much about Ethiopia, but did not mention or seem to realize how ancient Ethiopa was in a different location from modern Ethiopia. If he did mention it, I didn't notice."
3,OK NOT THA BEST...JUST BUY THIS ...AND YOU WILL LIKE THA REST!!!,"ALL I CAN SAY IS I LIKE IT,THAT'S ALL TO IT."
4,Not bad!,"This is definately a classic. As some of the reviewers have already mentioned, it does get somewhat juvenille at some points, though.This movie is from long before my time, but it really was enjoyable to watch."
3,A War Movie,"The writers of this film did a good job of trying to give what is basically a war movie a personal touch. There are cute vignettes with a band of rescued orphans and a soldier from Alabama. However, when all is said and done it is a war movie. For fans of this genre this movie is probably excellent. For those of us not so inclined, it gets to be rather dull once the orphans are placed in safe hands. While John Wayne was an American icon during his time, nowadays his fame is somewhat mystifying. As he is a rather stiff bloke and speaks in a very cracky monotone. My apologies to fans of his in saying that, but that is how he comes across to me. As far as special effects are concerned and filming, it does appear of be of high quality. So in sum, for movie fans it is a five star film. For the rest of us, a three star film."
3,Little more romance and little less fighting,The movie was good. Especially for those many nights when there is absolutely nothing else worthwile to watch on televison. A little more romance and a little less fighting would have made this an excellent movie. I was satisfied for the remainder of the night.
3,This album is Underrated ....people sayin',If you think this album isn't good you must have not listened to the same CD I did...I'd never heard him but on MERCEDES album..I thought he was tight on that...plus I get every NO LIMIT release anyway..I didn't know what to expect.. First song GAME TIGHT...tight as a mug...COME AND GET IT featuring Master P...tight as well...ON top OF DA WORLD..tight..We ain't hard to find wit Snoop Dogg and Mystikal...is second best song on this LP....more others good as well..best songs are I can't believe which sounds like MASE's song why u lookin' at me...and BODICUSSy is a funny song and is also the best on here....If you listen to one song you will like it..so don't listen to people who say it ain't good..cause they ain't real...MYSITKAL..Let's get ready to rumblepick it up
1,the souths got weak souce,"this is garbage, No limit and cash money are giving tru hip-hop a terrible name buy some real hip hop like arsonist or beatnuts."
4,"impressive solo cd, but....","though it just aint like when he was 'G-Note' in the Vallejo based rap duo Funk Mobb. Be sure to pick up 'It Aint 4 play'. G-note displays his fullest skills. No Limit groupies as well should soak this album up n recognize bay area game. And i gotta say that this wasn't your TYPICAL no limit album so why the hatin? Killafornia, What U Gone Do & a grip of cuts was on some real west coast sh*t. k-lou beats still SLAP!"
4,I Wish I could give it 4.5 stars!,"Whut the hell iz wrong wit U people! Lil Italy's album iz 1 of tha best 2 come out of No Limit Records so far! Tha best songs are Come & Get It, Doggs Ride,We Riderz, On Top Of Da World, and Bodicussy! Much luv 2 da last 6 customer reviewers on dis album!"
1,Weak Beats- Weak Lyrics- Weak Everything,"Don't get me wrong, No Limit has produced a good percentage of CD's that were tight as hell, but this CD just was not. The beats sounded weak and some what copied. The lyrics were alright but could use more work. Last, there was only one song that I even thought was alright and it features Snoop Dogg. This CD didn't take much time for them to produce and it is more then obvious as to why."
1,Sharing the Love,"When these four little scamps get together, they're worse than a sewing circle. Each one on his own is bad enough, but put all of them in one recording studio and suddenly you've got a homoerotic love-fest going on. Much of the resulting album consists of little more than grunting and groaning as they all ""get it on"" with each other. Then, every once in a while, one of them remembers they're supposed to be making a ""rap"" album and starts semi-rhyming about glocks and ""poppin' a cap in dat nigga's ass"", at which point the others giggle knowingly.I'm not homophobic or anything, but frankly I found the entire thing disgusting and utterly out of step with what I understand rap to be all about.Next time, guys, get it all out of your system in a hotel room before you set foot in a recording studio. Remember, you are supposed to be bringing a positive message to the community about guns, whores, crack, and bling bling. This is no time for you to be celebrating ""Greek"" love."
4,THIS CD IS DEFINETLY ONE TIGHT CD,MASTER P SHOULD ADVERTISE THIS RAPPER MORE THIS CD IS TIGHT LIL ITALY IN MY VIEW IS IN NO LIIMIT'S TOP FIVE RAPPERS I DEFINITLY AGREE WITH WHAT TRU DREW SAID
4,Good Quality,"Good quality and much more sturdy that the stock heat plates. These fit perfectly for a Brinkmann 6430 however the drain holes are not positioned to fully protect the burners. With that said, i'll still use these over the stock ones."
3,"From what I heard, it's really not all that bad.","I'll be honest, I have only heard 6 songs on it, and the first 5 songs I heard are kickass. As for the other one I heard, was piece of underproduced bull.Laaz Rockit - LeatherfaceDeath Angel - BoredWrath - When Worlds CollideHurricane - Spark in my heartSacred Reich - One NationWasted Youth - Gift Of MadnessThe first 5 songs I have listed are awesome. As for Wasted Youth's gift of madness, that song SUCKS! But Wrath - When Worlds Collide in my opinion is the best song I have heard. Then again, Wrath happens to also be one of my favorite songs too, so ya. The other reviews I have read were mixed, saying that the album is disappointing, but like every soundtrack, there will always be a few good up numbers. From what I have heard, it's true."
4,Refreshing openness,"Why should I spend time reading a book about ups and downs, nices and nasties, and goods and bads of someone's life and her spiritual journey? I read it and I really liked it. Because Ms. Miller's openness about her life and her spiritual journey gives me tremendous encouragement to continue to persue my own journey. Because I can relate to her. Because she shows me that even spiritual writers are not perfect and they are just the same form of humanbeing as myself. Plus, her techniques really work."
3,Decent Comp. for someone just getting into punk,This is an alright compilation of songs from a large number of punk bands. This album is good for someone just getting into punk because it has a pretty good variety of styles and bands.
5,Great product,"The auto ventshade is better than I expected. I bought this for a great price, received it earlier than promised,and it looks super nice. It has been on my Yukon for a month, no chips or fading. It was easy to install and fits perfect. I have purchased several products through Amazon, and I am very pleased with their service."
1,drogi i niedopracowany,oczekiwalam za taka cene czegos swietnego...a to dziala jakby kosztowalo polowe mniej.'touch screen' bardzo ciezki w obsludze(bo przyciski sa za male i trudno nacelowac na odpowiednia komende) zdan rowniez nie tlumaczy zbyt dobrze..jestem bardzo niezadowolona !!! (chcialam oddac ale okazalo sie ze mialam na to tylko kilka dni od daty kupienia)
3,travel read,"This is an interesting ""light"" mystery. I have it on my iPad and am reading it when I have spare minutes. I haven't read any of this author's works before, but might pick one up again when in need of a ""travel book."""
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with this novel. The idea was good, but the story was too drawn out for me and I didn't feel the mystery pulled together well. There were too many unanswered questions about the stone and some of the characters motivations. While I really liked Alix in the previous novel, I found her recklessness to be frustrating here and her romantic life a bore. On a positive note, I really liked the part of the story surrounding the Nordic festival. McClendon described it in a way that sounded so interesting...like you'd really want to be there. I enjoyed Painted Truth (book #2 in the series) so much though, that I think I will give Blue Wolf a try. I hope it's full of the plot twists and intricate storyline that I've liked in this author's other works."
5,A Great Read !!,"This is a fast moving story that combines humor, romance and tragedy. I laughed and I cried and I hated to see it end. The characters are well developed and I got very attached to them. I sincerely hope that there is a sequel!I highly recommend this book!!"
3,Not bad but should be longer,"Boxing is a forgotten art, cross-train and learn boxing now. Any part of your fighting game you're not training is the part where you're going to be beaten. Be a complete fighter with this book's help. Anyone interested in improving his/her stand-up skills with western boxing will benefit from this book. The pictures are clear, well set out and easy to put into a working personal system. Although I found this book helpful, it seemed to have left out some important strategic and endurance techniquest that I have found in other books."
3,It's good if you are a beginner.,"This is not a bad book if you are totally new to boxing, but if you aren't a beginner it presents information that you already know. I've been taking a boxing class twice a week for the past year, so all the information in the book was repetitious. Other than that it's a quick read with good illustration."
3,For beginners only...,"Danna Scott's Boxing is written for beginners. If you are brand new to the sport, it's a great tool to help understand the fundamentals. Otherwise, a more advanced boxing text would be more appropriate."
3,Ross Enamait's Books are far better,"In my opinion, the best bang for the buck when it comes to boxing and martial art information is written by Ross Enamait. His products can be viewed at www.rossboxing.com. The forum there is also great. Check it out before you purchase anything else. I think you will be very impressed. I know for a fact that I was, and I own and have read countless boxing and martial arts ""how to"" books.Todd ReinhardISSA--CFT"
3,NOT A LOT TO IT REALLY,It's not a bad book as such - but it's very basic. Pictures are good - but it needs a bit more content to make it worth the money.
4,Excellent resource,"I started boxing in my basement for physical fitness purposes, and I loved this book. I still refer to it from time to time, even out I memorized most of it. Highly recommend!!"
3,mixed bag,"The writer of Admissions Confidential provides us with a detailed, easy-to-read book on the day-to-day life of an admissions officer. The book reads like a summer novel. I would give it higher marks except for two things that really bothered me: 1) Ms Toor struck me as a liberal snob. She was excited about admitting the ""edgy"" student, but had her nose up at the rich people, jocks, and others who didn't seem to fit her profile. I began to think she was hired for diversity reasons vs the need to fill in some regional spots. 2) I really resented the section where she was stuffing the final response letters to students and was telling her partners ""sucks!"" when she came upon a person she remembers interviewing and didn't care for. That blew me away and even for a ""personal memoir"" struck me truly unprofessional and put the whole profession in a bad light."
4,Admissions Confidential,"I have an 11th grade boy whom I believed was ""ivy"" material. Now after reading this brutally honest book, I know I am off the mark. I think every parent who is concerned about where their child goes to college needs to read this honest and helpful book. Rachel Toor tells it like it really is; I believe she is telling the truth, and even though we don't want to hear or believe it, it is real."
1,a poor imitation of the real thing,"Rachel Toor is a sad case of someone who needed some attention in her life in order to build herself up. I feel sorry for the students who were in her region -- she obviously has a giant chip on her shoulder and does nothing more than glorify how much she looked down on them. Though the author asserts that this is not a book about how to get into college, that's certainly the market she's aiming for. Methinks she doth protest too much. She takes great pains to distance herself from ""other"" authors who write about the admissions process even though they do an infinitely more credible job and don't hide their motives as Toor does. As the reviewer above points out, there are much more informative books (A is for Admission, Writing the College Essay) than this one which is so offensive that it was hard to read through it at my local bookshop. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it. What an ego-trip."
2,Doubtful Objectivity; Not Carefully Written,"This book seemed to be too quick, too breezy and a little self-serving. It is always suspect when a former insider is revealing the goings-on in an environment that she las left and I felt that Ms Toor was more than a little superior-feeling and perhaps even bitter. The personal information did not seem to blend well with the rest of the book and I found it forced and not terribly interesting. Also, I saw one case in which she is talking about a student and changes mid-paragraph from ""he"" to ""she."" If you are interested in this topic, I would recommend you read ""The Gatekeepers"" and ""Bright College Years."""
1,"The person exposed in this ""tell-all"" book is the author.","While styling her book as an honest, tell-all account of life in the admissions office of an elite university, Rachel Toor merely exposes her own smallness as a peson. She reveals her disdain for most of the applicants in the region for which she was responsible, building herself up by tearing them down. This book has such a nasty tone that I would not permit a college-bound senior to read it -- it is designed to create anxiety among even the most talented of kids. If you want the straight scoop on admissions to the elite schools, try ""A is for Admission."" Rachel Toor appears to be on a major power trip."
5,It is what goes on.,"I am an admission director for your history graduate program and have two children in college. So I have gone through the admissions game from both sides. Toor is occasionally -- okay often -- too cute and this posturing is doubtless painful to readers caught in the meritocratic system. Nonetheless, what goes on at the most selective schools and programs is well reflected in this book. Especially valuable is the section on how legacies with big bucks totally transcend the selection system and are admitted by the development department."
1,"Schumann-Heink was one of the best, but this record did not do any justice to that beautiful voice. It was most disappointing",Schumann-Heink was one of the most beautiful voice of the 20th century. This record did not do any justice to that magnificent voice and singing. It was the worst vocal record I have ever come across in all my purchases.
2,Book about great art,I ordered what I thought were two completely different books that ended up being the same book with just a different title. It was just an okay book but no great lessons or anything of any real value. I wouldn't recommend it at all.
3,Great info on the breed but too much filler on others,"I read this cover to cover in one sitting. This text has some pertinent and practical bulldog facts and care tips, but the problem is that the majority of this book is not Bulldog-specific! A huge chunk is about the care and health of ANY dog. Very readable but disappointing in its lack of specificity."
4,"Not the Best, Not the Worst...","I am definetly not a Bulldog fan. I HATE them! But I am making a dog website and I looked at all the books in our library and tried to find one with new breeds in it. I saw that this book contained the ancestor of the mastiff-bulldog breeds! That was cool! What I have to say about the actual book is that in the first part is that it talks about the dogs, and then talks about health and care and things like that, and then it goes onto plain dogs. I give this a four because of these opposing properties."
5,Illustrated fiction,"Having only seen copies of the artwork from this book, I can still say that it lives up to the reputation of the forerunner, Tarzan of the Apes, also illustrated by Burne Hogarth. the only disappointment is that it was printed in black&white, not full color as was the 1st volume."
1,A bit disappointed....,"I enjoy this book, but was a bit disappointed at the ""last one"" advertisement with this purchase. I purchased it for more than I'd like to admit, and when I received the book, the suggested price on the book was $6.99. A whole lot less than what I paid. Won't do this again!"
4,One of the Best B-Action Flicks Ever.,"Paranoid atmosphere, strong camera work, brutal action scenes, and amazingly good acting combine to make this flick unique in its class. Low budget action movies are usually stagey and mechanical, with actors sleepwalking through their roles. Not here. Michael Ironside's simple death scene is acted with such enthusiasm that it stops the show. And Jeff Wincott is the most underrated hero in the movies today. Action fans will not be disappointed."
2,Shorinji Kempo Movie,"This is a biographical action movie about So Doshin, the founder of Nippon Shorinji Kempo Organization. If you are a practicioner of Shorinji Kempo or an avid martial arts fan, you will be interested in this movie. Other than that, I see no other reason to watch it. The story is dull if there is any at all. However, the action sequences are awesome. See some Shorinji Kempo techniques being performed in action. Sonny Chiba is a black belt both in Shorinji Kempo and Karate so he knows how to move and perform good in front of a camera.If you are not a Shorinji Kempo practicioner, you might want to check on what the art is about before you watch it."
3,actually not bad,""" I feel pain, I must be alive"" begins this movie as a mob killer awakes in the care of an autonomous government agency that has nursed him back to health after a deadly fire in which he was thought to have been killed. They plan to use him for several hits on scientists who have discovered AIDS to be a laboratory created disease. Though it's never said, you get the sense that they will either kill him or expose him after he does the last hit who happens to be a cutie doctor. So you can probably guess what happens in the end, but all in all it's an interesting story worth viewing if you like this type of flick.The one bad thing about this DVD is the sound and picture quality, it's not that great (kinda dark and grainy), but acceptable... I can't really complain."
4,One of Jeff's best,This is one of Jeff Wincott's best action movies as star - with a little more thought in the story and less emphasis on his martial arts moves. Good action movie.
5,Great!!,"I'm not a huge fan of the genre but I was totally knocked out by A Very Fast Descent Into Hell, a gripping, hypnotic tale of apocalyptic doom laced with dark wit and intensely lyrical verbal style. DESCENT grabs you from the first page and doesn't let go till the final sentence, with some truly terrific set pieces. Check it out!"
4,Another awesome band that ended too early,"Kollapse is a worthy sequel to Breach's first album, Venom. I first became aware of Breach from a friend who was really into Neurosis. He told me that Breach sounded somewhat like them, but included more experimental instruments and rhythms on their disc Venom. Kollapse has taken that formula even further, and it incorporates some truly odd songs with their tried and true dense, angry, metal. I was very disappointed when I found out that Breach had called it quits after Kollapse, because this was a band that had the potential to revolutionize a whole genre of music. Instead, they gave us a taste of what the future could sound like, and then left us hanging. If you are a fan of of the dense metal music of Neurosis and Meshuggah, then I'd recommend you discover Breach for yourself."
5,Hidden gem story-time stories,"My wife grew up with these stories. I had never heard of them (nor had my sisters). They are, quite simply, great. I should warn other buyers that I don't much subscribe to analyzing ""subtext"" in kid's stories. So these may be horrific on that scale for all I know. I think the stories are fun and the illustrations really captured and kept my daughter's interest. I hope Amazon keeps adding more to their publish-on-demand list."
1,Are you kidding me?,Are you kidding me? Are people getting this stupid? Western culture is going down the toilet if garbage like this has enough audience to get published.
1,DO NOT BUY,"This product was so weak. Could not even make a dent in bikini area. Could barely do my nose. Sellers ask us not to leave a bad review and they will do something to make it right (maybe return money or something else - I do not know) which is probably why there are not a lot of bad reviews on this product. However, I am hoping no one else will waste their money on this product. It really stinks...."
3,Worked for a while,It works and wold say for the price I paid it worked for about a year. There are other trimmers out there and this one is just as good if not better.
1,nothing!,"This product didn't work from the second it came out of the box. And since the warranty requires me to pay for the shipping, it's really not worth returning."
1,Got a lemon,"I was impressed with all the extra's that came with my bikini trimmer BUT.... the trimmer did not work like it's supposed to. I had been using my Mom's bikini trimmer (exactly the same model) that is a year old and was looking forward to having my own that was brand new. Only problem is the brand new one doesn't work as good as the year old one. I went to return the item..... only to find that Amazon doesn't except returns on trimmers. I know that this is a good product, but I got a lemon and I'm stuck with it....so I'm not to happy."
2,Not good for bikini area at all,I like a nice clean bikini area and this product simply will not get you there. I have never used it for facial hair but I tried it for my bikini area and it was a total waste of money. It took a long time trim a little bit of hair and it doesn't get close at all. Stubble in that area is just not acceptable...
5,Best De-Fuzzer Ever!,"After using the Bikini Touch, I can't imagine why any woman would use anything else to remove unwanted hair! I use it to shave my pits as well as my bikini area. No cream, no mess, no pain, and it really works!"
1,Arrived Broken,"I purchased this after reading many reviews. It came, I took it out of the package and threw the package away. A few days went by and I tried ot use it. It did not work. Hmmm, maybe hte batteries are dead. Eventually i bought new batteries but it still did not work so I got a busted product. Not worth the chance, would not suggest this product"
2,Barely effective for those with darker hair!,"As the reviewer below mentioned, this device neither shaves nor removes the hair around the bikini area, but instead seems to trim it down to a small point. This is ok if all you want is to not have long hairs creeping around, but I was expecting a much smoother result, and this thing doesn't cut it! I have very dark hair, and it was still visible after trimming, plus it hardly seemed to touch thicker hairs! Where this does work quite well is on my upper thighs, where the hair is lighter and finer, but I have other things to remove hair there! All-in-all, I'm disappointed by this device and wouldn't recommend it in place of waxing, epilating, or just plain shaving."
3,It does what it needs to do,"Don't expect this little gadget to survive long but while it lasts it does a good job. This is my second one, the first lasted about a year. I compared many others and didn't feel the need to spend 40 dollars or more for other brands which were basically the same concept just made out of stonger materials. Take care of it and don't use it in the shower or bath and it will probablly last longer then one year. No pain and a fairly close shave; what else do you want for the price."
1,Junk,"The motor on this went out in about two weeks. It was not a battery issue, but a motor issue, and therefor a quality issue."
3,Not their best... to say the least.,"I have to say, I was disappointed when I got this CD. The only other UT CD I have is Ghetto Soul, their latest and greatest CD, which is one of my favorite CD's. It contains many of the best from Wild Child. Sadly, however, this one seems that it is lacking the energy and ska and roll from their other CD's. This has more or a ska mixed with 80's hip hop mixed with funk feel to it, which I don't really fancy.After listening to the CD for a while, I'll admit, there are some catchy songs, it's not all bad. But this isn't one of those CDs that will be in my cd player for weeks on end, and it's not something to fret over if you don't have it. It is good for an occasional listen, though, but not a whole lot else."
4,I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT,This is the most sweet movie yet {besides vampire hunter D} It ranks number 2 in my book.
3,man what a cliche corny animated show,"i bought new domion thinking it was going to be as great as the the dominion tank police ive been hearing about. ive never seen the first one. when i popped new dominion tank police into my vcr and struggled through the first episode, i dreaded the next. to me this was a waste of money. the animaion was ok and the stories were cliche. action was almost non existent. but that doesnt make a good anime. new dominion to me is boring. i think this one is over hyped. but this is my opinion. check it out for yourelf. rent it before you buy it. now i need to check out domion tank police to see if that one is hype or the real thing."
3,new no good,if you watched th first tape of the series it should have made you happy and all tingly inside ready to by the next tape right? dont because after thew first one it goes down stream little tank weilding action and the story horrible cause it seems some one making it lost it and said i quit after the first tape believe me it ant as fun as the original worst of all this is only the 2/3 in the series and a peice of advice if you want to get the last tape good luck your gong to be depressed
4,New Dominion Collateral Damage,"I fondly remember having this on VHS back in the mid-90's; it's the 6-episode sequel to the late 80's 4-part ""Dominion Tank Police"" series.Though not as engaging as the first series, it does have it's merits, and for those who had a crush on the awfully bad-behaved Cat Sisters Anna and Uni Puma, they will be rewarded by many appearences of the badly (un)dressed duo throughout the story (I'm not sure if they're androids like in the manga, or modified humans--- there is a scene with them featuring opened cans of food at one stage, but no matter; they're still adorable/spiteful/mentally backward as ever). And of course there's plenty of techno-action from that ridiculously small ""Bonaparte"" tank...An interesting series for collectors of Masamune Shirow memorabilia(Ghost in the Shell, etc.)"
4,Dealing with the punks in the only way they can understand,"Not quite as manic or blackly comic as ""Dominion Tank Police"" and not as darkly lit either, this is still a fun and funny entry in the Anime cannon. The humor is more harmless slapstick here than it was in the first series (no tying thugs to spinning wheels while throwing knives at him stuffing a live grenade in his mouth). Some of the English voice cast were replace, some for the better, some for the worse, an other with no real noticable difference."
