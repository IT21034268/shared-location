2,Face was too large,Skagen men's 233xlttn titanium watch was returned face was too large. Ordered another with smaller face. Was otherwise happy with product.
5,Great Watch!,"This watch is very smart and sturdy. The wrist band is simple to adjust and the watch itself is quite stylish. The digits on the watch are very easy to read and it is all around pretty simple to use. This watch has suffered quite a bit of abuse from me including falling from around 100 ft in the air and traveling at least 40 mph on impact, and yet it is still ticking. After months of use the only problems with it are some scratches which are all my own fault. All around a very stylish and simple watch. Worth every penny"
3,The band is terrible,"The band is very difficult to size. It is difficult to get on, and it feels like it will probably come off will you are moving. It is a beautiful watch that keeps perfect time as it sits on my dresser. I wasn't expecting much for the price but the band is junk."
3,Great Looking,"This is truly a beautiful watch.The picture on Amazon is good but this watch is much more handsome.I'll review this watch again in several months;but,I cant give it 5 stars because it's made in China,so is it really up to Scandinavian quality?"
4,Nice watch,The watch is a great watch for the price. I have already received several compliments from folks that say it is a great looking watch. I like how the latch locks the watch even though it took me a bit to figure out how to lock it. I have small wrists so I like how slim it is and how well it fits with long sleeve shirts. Bottom line the watch is a great value and is very stylish.
5,great price for this watch,I bought this for a gift so I did not open the box... until today. I had to be sure it was what my son wanted and yes it is. It is a beautiful watch - now it gets re-wrapped for Christmas! As I said earlier this was shipped well packaged and in little time. Thanks for the purchase. My son is going to enjoy it.
4,This watch is very attractive & sleek,"I bought this watch for my husband and he really likes the way it looks. It is sleek and light weight. The blue face is different and very attractive. And the band is comfortable. The only slight negative is it's a little difficult to secure the clasp, takes a little practice to master."
3,Just not right,"Lovely watch for the right person - not me. Disliked the dark color of the mesh band, wanted and expected a more shiny silver colored band.Really like the blue face, but not the dark band."
4,Prepare for random compliments,"This watch is perfect as a casual dress watch. I like the slim profile, and the blue dial really seems to attract your eye. I get random compliments on it all the time. The clasp is a little suspect, and the only negative about the watch. Its easy to not hook it up properly, and it could fall off if your not carefull."
3,"Like the watch, but...","...the band is a bit unreliable. It's come loose several times and I imagine it will inevitably fall off and be lost, at which point I'll replace this watch with one with a better band. Also, the calendar is too small and too recessed to be legible (at least for my aging eyes.)UPDATE 5 MONTHS LATER...SURE ENOUGH, THE WATCH FELL OFF AND I LOST IT!! Bought another one - this band's much better!"
2,"Great looking, but durability is a problem","I bought this watch in December of 2011. It looks ten times better in person and I loved it at first. However, after a couple months of normal, everyday use, the left side of the band popped out of the case. My watch clearly was not ""Incredibly strong"" like Amazon claimed.I'm now getting a full refund for the watch. I realize that this could just be a single strange scenario because of all the positive reviews, but I obviously was not pleased with the product."
2,I like the watch but I've had bad luck with it ...,"I bought this watch four years ago. The watch looks great but within a year a couple of strands from the mesh band came loose and started ripping my jackets and shirt sleeves. The replacement band cost almost as much as the watch itself, but I replaced it.Three years later, the glass case cracked. This will also cost as much almost the price of the watch to repair."
2,Band is Junk,"I just got the watch today and when I had to adjust the band to fit by bigger wrists it busted. The clock part of the watch seems very decent but the band is total junk. The watch says made in Denmark, so it should be excellent quality as I have bought many things from the region ""always top quality."" But they must have outsourced the band because even if I didn't have to make any adjustments to it, I can tell it wouldn't have lasted more then a week."
5,Blue watch,"It is a beautiful watch, better looking in person than in the picture. Bought it for my husband and he is very pleased with it."
5,Truly Spectacular and Awesome Price!!!,"This is truly a spectacular watch.. Ultra thin, very classy looking but not too ""la dee da"" over the top. Waterproof, yes you can shower with it and you don't have to mess with putting it on and off.. Best of all is the price... Geez.. remind me again why people waste money on status symbols like a Rollex ? The mesh band breathes easy when you live in a hot and humid place. Maybe it's time for other readers to toss those tired old Casios and say goodbye to the clunky thick junk you got now.I found this one after seeing s similar brand in Germany not sold in the U.S. and I'm so thankful I got this one instead."
4,Different type of watch!,I have to admit it has grown on me. The fact that the band is titanium is cool. The watch is VERY thin. The blue face is clean and cool looking. If you own multiple watches I think it is a good pick up. I would not wear this as my sole watch but is nice to wear occasionally
5,Excellent timepiece,"This makes the second time I've purchased this watch. The first time was in 2005. The first watch still works just fine, but the blue face has faded from all the sunlight exposure, and the band was damaged during some work I was doing on an auto engine. Certainly not the manufacturer's fault. The price was so good that I decided to replace the watch rather than just the band. Now I use the old watch when I'm at work, and the new one when I'm not. Both watches keep excellent time, and aren't off by more than thirty seconds a month. I really like the blue face, style, & comfort. The other notable feature is the scratch resistant crystal. With all the abuse my first watch got from my banging, the crystal is still as clear as the day I got it. In all, I found this watch to be a great value, and it provides very reliable service. What more can you ask of a moderately priced watch?"
1,Tricky Clasp - died after 22 months . . .,"It took me reading some else's review to finally read the tiny manual and figure out how to secure the clasp!! I like the watch enough - great looking and comfortable!NEW BELOW:It was pretty cool for almost 2 years . . . . but is no longer functioning. I replaced the batterry, but am unable to set the time. So, I guess you shouldn't expect it to last more that about 22 months!"
2,Bought Because of a good review but was dissapointed.,"When people said that this watch is meant for casual wear i didn't realyze what casual actually meant. When i first bought the watch a week later i wore it to a wedding. Due to a lot of clapping that was going on it just fell off my wrist due to the bracelet pin failing and falling somewhere on the crouded floor. Dissapointed i took the watch for repairs. It came back seemingly normal and in what looked like good shape. One day later i bent my wrist backwards slightly while leaning on the wall and same problem occured. I took it to repairs yet again. And few days later same thing. The watch looks great works great too, as long as you don't touch it or move your arms around a lot or put any strain on the bracelet what so ever."
3,Quality problems,"Like many others, I love the design of this watch. However, my watch would periodically stop ticking, averaging every month or so since I bought it. Then I had to pull out the time-adjust knob and push it back in to make it tick again. It isn't that big a deal, but not a mark of high quality."
4,Great watch,"Love this watch - I in fact bought this as a replacement for an identical one that I had managed to lose - it was the only watch I considered I like it so much. It's light, attractive - great for a business casual type look. Keeps time well. Only knock is the clasp seems to get quite loose with repeated use ... not sure if that's how I lost the last one, hopefully not!"
4,Nice looking and great style,"I gave the watch as a gift, and while I was hoping for a bigger watch face - the gun metal band along with the blue face is just gorgeous. I have a Skagen as well and the company is just AWESOME!"
2,Band is beautiful but closure sucks,This bang is beautiful but impossible to hook the clasp. It is missing the connection between the two sides of the band that allows you to slip it on and then latch. It is a twoPart step. If I had two hands it wod be easy. But with one hand almost impossible.
3,"Nice watch, awkward fastener on wristband","The headline pretty well sums it up. It's a handsome and accurate watch, but it took two trips to a jeweler (who charged me nothing) to learn to work the fancy fastener on the wristband, and I am not sure I have it really nailed down yet. Otherwise, it's a good watch at a good price. I like it.Chad Skaggs"
1,Chinese knockoff?,Strap was frozen and could not be adjusted. Strap lock did not engage properly and prone to coming loose. Strap locking mechanism was not the same as shown in on site photo. Was cheap imitatation.The watch was running indicating it had been returned previously. It has Pacific Cost time indicating where it was returned from.
3,Not Rated as water proof to 99 feet,"Don't get me wrong this is a great watch, it's attractive and comfortable. However, I like a versatile watch. This watch is not rated to 99 feet as advertised by Amazon. You can't take a shower or a quick swim with the watch on. If you don't want to remove your watch for these activities, don't buy this watch. The best you can do is wash your hands with it on, or splash water on it. This information from the watch manual and watch seller. I bought it because I believed the hype."
2,bad clasp,This is very attractive watch;HOWEVER the clasp is not user friendly and does not stay closed. My husband requested it be returned because it fell off 4 times the first day he wore it.
2,Nothing to get excited about.,"I ordered this watch because of all the amazing reviews posted here. But after I got it, I was rather disappointed. I felt I really needed to post a more level headed review here so it can help others. I can't understand why so many people come in their pants over this watch. It's as plain looking as it gets. The minute and hour arms are so thin that you can hardly tell them apart. The calender window is so small that you have to move the watch right into your face. And I'm 30 years old and don't even wear glasses. The dial color looks more like black than blue. It's not a shiny bright blue as shown on the picture here. I noticed a lot of kids in my college started wearing this watch and others made by Skagen. So it looks like a fad. Thanks to amazon's great customer service, I returned the watch and bought a Citizen which I'm very happy with."
2,Skagen Junken,"Very nice looking, and the illusion of being slim ... but the clasp started undoing itself within a year. Yes, suddenly the watch would almost fall off my hand. Replaced it with a model with leather strap, but one day the crystal just ... cracked! For no reason. Skagen is junk."
5,"Beautiful watch, great workmanship","I bought this watch because it is thinner than my previous watches and I liked the idea of titanium. The band was easily adjustable without any tools and I have worn it constantly since putting it on. I like the look and feel of this watch and if anything happens to it, I will replace it with another just like it. I would definitely recommend it."
5,Wonderful Watch,"I really like this watch, unfortunately I forgot to take it off while working outside and the mesh band got snagged on a tool and tore. I mended it back the best I could but it the band looks horrible with the large dent. Fortunately I found a replacement form on Skagens website and a replacement band is $15 plus shipping."
4,Great except for the closing mechanism,"I get lots of compliments on this watch, and I'm very happy with it. It looks GREAT, and it seems to keep very accurate time. The watch is very thin and sleek. The closing mechanism is clumsily designed, though. It takes quite a bit of effort to get the ends of the buckle lined up properly to hook together and lock, without upsetting the adjustment that tightens and loosens the watch band. I would definitely get this watch again, but this watch definitely requires nimble fingers. Once you actually close the buckle, though, it stays closed securely."
5,Light and thin.,"I have had several of these Skagen watches and love them. They are very thin and lightweight. They come in many different styles and colors to suit your taste. The reason I go through so many of them is that I wear them while doing yard work and various repairs with power tools and I never take my watch off except to clean it. Therefore, the watch gets a lot of ware. But since the price is so low I can replace it every couple of years as needed.Try this beautiful and reliable watch and I think you will be glad you did."
1,2 out of 2 arrived with non-working catch,"Beautiful watch intended as Christmas gift for my husband, but it arrived with the catch not functioning at all. Returned the watch and received a replacement which had the EXACT SAME problem. It's unfortunate that Skagen can make such a beautiful watch and yet not have quality control of their products. I had considered trying a third watch, but decided that I couldn't trust the company to provide a reliable product.."
5,I Love This Watch,"At the low price I paid for this on Amazon, I absolutely LOVE this watch! It is well made and high quality build. But, most importantly, it is the lightest watch I have ever worn. I have a very sensitive wrist due to two ganglions, but I hardly know I am wearing this watch. One of the best purchases I have ever made online."
3,"An Okay Book for Babies and Toddlers - a review of ""The Rabbit""","I don't know a great deal about John Burningham other than the fact that he has been writing and illustrating books for along time. ""The Rabbit"" comes from 1974. Not exactly a high point for children's literature. Yet this book is okay.The artwork is simple and sweet. The text simple and appealing. Text follows so you can judge for yourself.We have a rabbitHis favourite food is dandelionsI like to stroke the rabbitSometimes the rabbit gets outHe likes to hop aboutin the gardenThree Stars. A nice book for babies and toddlers. If you have a child that likes bunnies, this might make a good addition to their library. Especially at these prices."
3,read dummies first,"if you have no Java experience, this book throws you into the deep end of the pool right away. I purchased 3 books on leaning java for a beginner. This was the most valuable in the long run albeit the most difficult. There is no hand holding and lots of good examples with few mistakes and lots of multiple examples within a single example (confused, read the book and you'll see what I mean). I suggest you get this book but if you need hand holding, also bur Burd's java for dummes to start with."
1,Disappointment,"I have already bought and read Palm Programming for the Absolute Beginner. I learned a lot with that book and it was extremely helpful. The author presented the language in a basic but informative way. At that time, I was an absolute beginner to computer programming. Now, I just bought Java Programming for the absolute beginner and was very disappointed. Not only does the author make no sense in explaining the language, but he also digresses to other topics that are just pointless. I don't recommend this book at all. If you have a problem with something, this book is not helpful. Hope this was helpful..."
1,THIS BOOK IS OBSOLETE- DON'T BUY IT!!!,"I just bought this book for my son, only to find out that the entire book is based on the J2SE 1.3 SDK which was end-of-lifed in December 2006 (for Windows and Linux) and is no longer available, so the book is USELESS (unless you happen to have a Solaris 8 box sitting around)!AMAZON - STOP SELLING THIS BOOK!OH - SORRY - you can get the 1.3 SDK for HP-UX if you have one of those!"
1,"Going, going, gone","I bought this for the web downloadable content, which turned out to be non-existant. After a call to customer service I learned that this book has been marked to go out of print by the publisher and the accompanying content was taken off the website. To be able to get the content that goes along with the book, customer service needs to contact the publisher to see if they even have the files in the first place. I was told to expect a phone call in 48hrs, if there is no content the book goes back.Be wary if you need the content that goes along with this book. You may not be able to get it."
5,EXCELLENT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,With songs as good as 'life thru a lens' and 'one of gods better people' this is the best album ever.WELL DONE ROBBIE!!!!I could listen to it until I die
5,Great Variety of Music and Meaningful Lyrics!,This C.D. is so awesome! The words are powerful and what he's getting across is much more than meaningless drivel. An Excellent Gotta-Have-It C.D.
2,Ok Book Could be better,This book was quite good the description was good but the action and excitement. Not a very good bargain. We Read it in English at my School
3,The Ghost Of Thomas Kempe,The Harrison family move into their new house and James wants the attic turned into his bedroom but whilst they are cleaning out the attic they find a bottle with a message in and they accidentally smash it and what they don't know is that a spirit is released.After this there is lots of messages being left around.No one believed james and no one ever did until things got too bad and they all wish they had believed him. It is written by Penelope Lively who is a very affective author.
3,It's ok afterall,"Well, I didn't find this book very interesting but it's okay. I read this book because my English teacher wants us to. But anyways, if you love horror, then don't read this book cuz it's nothing scary or something like that."
2,Not Fond,"If I have to read a translation of Dante's Inferno, then at least let it be in poetry form. This book is supposed to be the best poem in the Italian language, and if the author does not even try, then why should I. It was a decent, but literal translation."
2,Dante for Bigots??,"Esolen is neither a Dante scholar nor an Italian language/literature specialist. He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution. His retelling of the Divine Comedy is reasonably accurate and quite readable. The problem comes with his notes. They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive. Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications . This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as something like ""that most heinous of sins"". This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally out of tune with Dante himself, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD. And there are other personal and inappropriate comments.There are many superior translations out there. Mandelbaum's is excellent and has very good notes. Robert and Jean Hollander's is also very fine and the notes are the most extensive and scholarly of all."
3,Question,Does this hook up to the Playstation for dance steps or is it just the music? It's not clear in the description. Thanks!
5,Entrancing Witchblade.,"I'm a fairly new fan of Witchblade and as such, still coming to grips with the epic scale and complexity of the series, but I'm loving it. The best thing about the whole series is that it is an adult series. Sara Pezzini and all the other bearers of the Witchblade are all mature, intelligent, tough and sexually alluring women. The bearers are not squeaky clean super heroes in the old fashioned sense and they are certainly not adverse to using their feminine wiles to get their way. The stories in Distinctions are an excellent background and supplement to the main thread of Witchblade. Artwork and design is excellent in all the stories and the book is well bound."
5,Excelent gift for Besler print owners,"I purchased this book as a gift for someone who owns a Besler print. In fact, they own the print that is on the cover of this book. The large thick book is a very lovely display of Besler's famous prints, organized by the seasons in which the plants he observed in the garden grew. It would make a good gift to anyone, especially gardeners with large empty coffee tables."
3,Doesn't ring my bell.,"I am a fan of all things blue, so, when my old Trimline-style phone died, I was happy to find this one in my favorite color at such a low cost. It is much lighter than my old phone, which has advantages and disadvantages. It comes with matching cords and is very easy to dial. After I'd had it for a few weeks I noticed that its electronic twittering ring was getting more abreviated. By the end of two months it had stopped ringing altogether. I tried it on other lines, but the problem remained. It still answers calls fine and dials well, but I have had to replace it because I couldn't tell when the phone was ringing."
5,Nice Product,We use the Vector VEC-260 10-Inch WAXXPro Waxer/Polisher for our auto detailing business and it holds up very well and is easy to handle.
2,Vector VEC1093 - Plastic Clamps Broke,"Battery clamp broke in only 4 days. The clamps were plastic and one snapped, probably due to the spring tension of the clamps. Vector suggested I ship it back to them (at my expense)and they would send me a new unit. I suggested they have their Chinese suppliers design a more durable battery clamp.Otherwise, the VEC1093 charger appears to be as advertised and does a good job. I would buy another if they ever redesigned the battery clamps."
1,Vector 1093,Bought this unit new instead of reconditioned . Used it appx. 5 times and it broke.(had it for 5 mo.) The shipping is appx 14.00 everytime it is sent back for repair. They sent me a reconditioned one back and it didn't work. These do not appear to be of very good quality chargers. I ordered a schumacher 1275A-PE to replace it. If you get one of these then good luck to you........
4,Awesome charger - terrible clamps,"If you buy this charger, I suggest immediately investing a coulple of bucks on some decent quality metal clamps to replace the flimsy plastic ones. Other than that one weak spot, the unit is brilliant. With the desulfating function, I have brought several starter batteries back from the brink after months of sitting undercharged. The charger is a little quick to throw a fault code if the battery is very weak, but a few tries at the lowest setting, with a desulfate cycle thrown in between them usually does the trick. Of course, overly discharging a lead acid battery is highly destructive to the battery anyway, but this charger is the closest thing you will find out there to a miracle cure. It is also very well suited to maintaining a perfect charge on banks of RV batteries during winter storage. It comes on and tops off the batteries only when it detects the need, so there is no danger of overcharging and boiling off electrolite."
5,A great charger for the home auto mechanic.,"I tried it through all of the features and it is what they advertise. I am very satisfied.I do not think it would hold up under the heavy use of a commercial auto business, but if you want a super hi tech, light weight, 40 amp charger that will do an excellent job for the home auto mechanic, this ones for you."
1,Not worth the bother,"Being a licensed electrician I was interested in this unit and I purchased the VEC1093D. The advertising does not tell you that this charger will not charge batteries that have less than 4 volts left. In other words you are purchasing a battery charger that will not charge a dead battery! If the battery wasn't dead why would one need a charger? It would not charge a brand new car battery that become fully discharged. I had to jump the car and let the alternator charge the battery. Some smart charger. You can turn it on and it will charge for awhile and walk away thinking it is charging and find a fault code and the battery still dead when you return. Sometimes it will give a different fault code on the same battery each time it is turned on. The labels on the front started curling off within a week. This ""smart charger"" is a waste of time and money. Get an old fashioned charger with a knob or switch on the front - they work every time."
1,Junk Don't by it!!!,I bought the 2/6/12 amp product at a local but national parts store chain thinking it was going to be a good one.But it will not charge a battery that is dead and is still good. Sometimes the battery is new but not in use for a few month on one of my collector cars and needs the charge. Also the clamps are crap and break. The spring in the clamp is too strong for the plastic housing and they break in half at the clamping point.No support from where I bought it either. They don't carry the product anymore...
3,Vector 1089A 12V Battery Charger,I purchase the Vector battery charger from Amazon and the invoice said it was sold by DAM Distributors. I sent in my warranty card to Vector Manufacturing and it came back. I found out that Black & Decker purchased the product line. Now the unit is defective and I cannot find out how to get a warranty repair done. Any suggestions.
1,Junk Rippoff,"I finally through mine in the garbage today and decided to tell everyone about it. It is Junk, The clamps broke but worse is if your battery is completely dead it will not charge. Why would someone make a charger that would will not charge a dead battery. Junk!!!!Rippoff"
2,Poorly Constructed,"This battery charger is much better than a standard manual charger in so much as it properly charges a battery through stages. It will not charge a battery that is ""dead"" without faulting. Best to give your battery a boost from a manual charger, then switch over to the Smart charger. The battery clamps are very poorly made and will easily break. Replacement parts are not available through the manufacturer."
5,Excellent performance,"I was first using a charger (for an power inverter) that couldn't charge my batteries. I have 2 bank batteries (4 each), a 3 years old one, and a new one. The ancient one gave me performance that I never thought it could have given me : they are 3 years old !! and they keep working ! I haven't tested the new one performance yet !It's a smart charger. It gave your batteries the good charge at the needed rate ! and it automatically stops when the batteries are full.The only problem is that I thought I could charge my batteries at 100 Amp rate ! but I was wrong : this is an engine start system..."
1,Clamp broke.... plastic junk,"Ground clamp broke... only matter of time before the other one breaks as they are both made out of PLASTIC. I plan on replacing both myself and if/when the charging portion does not work as it should, it is going in the garbage and I will never buy another Vector product again. Customer service is horrible. Save your money -- there are better chargers available for same or less $$$."
1,Inadequate Charger,"I found the charger did not work when I really needed it. My car battery was totally dead after several days with the dome light on (didn't know at the time). When the charger was connected to the battery, the charger would not start charging and would display an error that it was not connected to the battery. The owner's manual confirmed that the battery charger will not work if the battery has less than 4 volts in it. For me, this is unacceptable. There should some sort of override on this."
3,Adequate attempt at commercial tie-in,"If you grew up on the original ""Poky Little Puppy"" books like I did, you may be very disappointed with this recent revision.The Poky Little Puppy gets separated from his family once again. This time he ends up on Sesame Street and his adventures overlap with the characters there. He takes a nap in Big Bird's nest, meets Bert and Ernie, and finally finds the smell that separated him from his family (let's just say that someone has to bake those cookies that Cookie Monster loves so well).The book is actually fairly well written, and the artwork is recognizable. I suspect those of you with kids will find that they like the ""cross-over"" and seeing their favorite Sesame Street characters with that loveable little puppy (my child isn't old enough to recognize either). However, the purest in me just finds it a little disheartening"
1,Chinesse Junk,More junk from China. Missing screws and some power-up light that the poorly (miss spelled and unspaced words everywhere) written instructions said were included.
4,"Good book, great cookies, bad copy.","This book would have received five stars, except for the fact that mine was printed incorrectly and I must see about returning it for a good copy. One chapter is printed twice, and the duplicate eliminates one section entirely. Odd mistake, and one I've never seen before.On to the content: Ms. Rosenberg's first book was excellent. This wasn't as good, but it was still much better than other cookie books out there. Why? Well, the recipies are easy to follow, fun to make, and good to eat. On making them the frustration level is nil. It is a refreshing book for cooks of all areas of expertise -- and a great volume to share with the kids. There are definetly some noteworthy treasures in here, worthy of becoming the stuff of family legend.Like I said, great book. I look forward to getting a shiny new copy so I can see what I'm missing! ;)"
5,Love this cookbook!,"This is a great cookbook. I also have Rosie's All-Butter, Fresh Cream, Sugar Packed No Holds Barred Baking Book and I wasn't sure if this would measure up because it is awesome. It holds it's own rather well Lots of great recipes here and I highly recommend it. These recipes are for days when you are throwing the diet out the door. Just bake and enjoy!"
5,Grandma's favorite cookie book!,"This is a no-fail cookie book for extraordinary cookies every time. Mine is dog-eared, stained, and loved. I have kept notes in the margins of the dates when first I tried each recipe, how much it was liked, some family events happening, and any recipe adaptations made. It has withstood the test of time and the paperback edition still has not fallen apart. I frequently give this book for gifts to my favorite people who bake cookies. It is not a beginner book for the new cook as there are too many choices and too many ingredients to make it easy. But for those who are interested in making disappearing cookies, this is the choice."
3,Quantity over quality . . .,"I'll give her credit, Rosie has a large selection of recipes to choose from, but the basic layout of this cookbook is not ideal, and her measurements are a bit freaky. You'll see 1 cup + 6 tablespoons of flour(isn't that a third of a cup?) Or 12 tablespoons of butter, or 6 tablespoons of milk . . . Again, couldn't that be converted to something more mainstream, like liquid ounces? And the recipes are frequently not all on one page, so you get to flip back and forth from the ingredients to the directions. Her writing is very chatty and comforting, but the recipies I've tried (and there have been several) have only been OK - not memorable."
4,Not as good as her first book but...,still good. The cookie recipes are easy to follow and the results are consistently delicious. I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys making cookies.
5,My all time favorite cookie recipes (plural),"These are the best cookie recipes I have ever used. I get so many compliments any time I take cookies from this book to a party. Rosie's directions are explicit, which I appreciate because the cookies turn out right every time. I would highly recommend this cookbook."
5,Awesome DVD!!!!!,"I love The Punany Poets!!!! This dvd is the epitome of this spectacularly gifted group of folk!!!! After watching the video, you will want to know when they r coming to ur town to perform!!!!"
5,Music from the heart,"I stumbled onto this tv series on Netflix and became addicted. The various songs are written to portray each of the characters and musically interpret the emotions of the episode. I absolutely fell in love with all the music and Rebecca Lavelle's lovely voice. I only wish that the theme song was included on this cd. Regardless, it is wonderful music and well worth the purchase."
4,easy listening.,I loved the TV series McLeod's Daughters and most of the songs. This album shares a lot of the songs and I enjoy listening.
5,Purchasing Used CD's,"As a first time buyer of used CD's, I was very pleased with the quality and the speed in which I received the items."
5,I enjoy this cd,I love the series and this cd is the best I've bought in a long time. I like almost every song on it. That is a lot to be able say of any album. I'll be buying the other cd soon.
4,Mostly great songs...,"I'm glad I got this CD. I've really enjoyed the series, and the music reminds me of the program. But there are also just some nice songs that are simple but have a good sound and speak of truths. I don't care for a couple of the songs, but most of them are wonderful."
3,Good but not great,"The sound is softer than a similar keywound clock I used to own, and the case on the clock that was sent did not have a chrome ring as shown in the product picture (instead, it was just a cheap plastic piece).However, I guess you get what you pay for (the thing isn't that expensive), and I need all the alarm clocks I can get to wake up, so perhaps I shouldn't complain."
4,Best Damn Value Out There!,"I had a very old stem-wind Westclox pocket watch that while the plastic bezel is cracked is still ticking! I thought I would try this alarm clock because of this and for those rare occasions when the power is out. It has performed just as it was described and the alarm, while loud enough to wake you, is not so loud that it knocks you out of your bed to the floor. The easy turn key, easy setting switch and dials are outstanding! A clock that is well worth the price asked!A wonderful reminder of the time before 24 hour everything! Young people laugh at us old-timer's but when the lights or electricity go out they're the ones who are in a panic because their cell-phone battery is out!"
3,Satissfactory travel alarm,"I was looking for a Rensie Travel Alarm, this old clock served my mother and then me since the 50s. I can only hope this Westclox functions for half that long"
2,clock works but poor quality,"Wind-up travel alarm clocks are hard to find so I settled for this one. It works adequately (for now) but it arrived with a scratched face-plate (plastic) and a muffled alarm sound. It exhibits the cheapest construction I've ever seen in a clock, including the case--I have little confidence the plastic hinges will last long. The windup mechanism feels like a toy. NOT worth the price. Amazon should find a quality supplier for this item."
4,Great automatic watch at an amazing price..with expected drawback,"I purchased this as a gift when it was at a sub 60 dollar price range. All in all seiko 5 are incredible timepieces, this one being no exception. The grey dial is absolutely beautiful. It boasts a very nice grid pattern that does not distract from the overall face. The lume of the watch hands and number markers are very bright when charged. The back of the watch has the always classy looking clear glass. Being that it is an automatic movement, the watch must be worn or ""wound"" by using a watch winder. The expected fault of this watch is definitely the band. It is very cheap feeling, and I personally would never wear it, however I expected this and ordered a beautiful leather pilot strap to replace the garbage steel. Tis watch has a band width of 20mm high is great for replacing with leather. As soon as this watch goes back to the price I paid I will not hesitate to purchase one for myself.."
3,Nice watch with little stamina,"The watch of my preference should be simple and clean, just as this Seiko. It came at a reasonable price, which went up as I live in Europe and the delivery cost increase the price with 50%. Still it was nicer than from the picture and I really like it. Compared to my 15 year old Seiko Kinetic the wrist strap was finished less refined and, the biggest draw back, the mechanically wound watch watch can only do for say 36 hours before the watch stops. For a watch I only wear during week days, a small drawback. Maybe next time (15 years) a buy a kinetic again."
5,The Enchanted April,"I loved this story, however I was not happy with the book itself. It was paperback and the pages fell out on a regular basis...approximately 15 or 20 of them."
1,Completely dissatified.,"Completely dissatisfied. I did not realize that 'region 2 encoding' means that it will not play on standard US DVD machines. I also did not absorb the info that it was subtitled in Swedish...cover information in Swedish etc. The company responded to my inquiry immediately however, and gave me instructions for returning it and getting a refund minus 20%.Enchanted April"
4,The Enchanted April,Truly an enchanting story. The thoughts and feelings of the four women are believable. I am really enjoying this book.
3,Trite,"I found it a little boring and hard to keep reading. It was just okay. It was also a bit ""wordy""."
5,So well written!,I loved this book! The characters were so well defined and the story was marvelous. I've recommended this to many as a wonderful read!
1,DO NOT BUY THE Echo Library EDITION,"I am 1/3rd of the way through this book. If you enjoy Austen and the like, as I do, you will enjoy this novel. However, I encourage you to buy a different edition. This edition of the book is riddled with typos. ""r"" instead of ""n"", ""her"" instead of ""he"", etc. And it's not just occaisionally. Sometimes it's several on a page. It interupts the flow of the story and I'm about ready to chuck this copy and check a different edition out of the library."
4,A delightful read,"Well, you've already heard about the story. Just wanted to add that the characters were so real, it was as if I were really there with them. A wonderful turn of events at the end. Caught me off guard. Very enjoyable. Beautiful writing. Now I've got to rent the movie."
5,"Flowers, sunshine, and self-awareness...","This is a delightful story...one of my favorite books! Gives you a little faith that even seemingly irreconcileable situations can be restored or transformed, that drastically different people can find common ground and become friends, and that people can change their lives for the better! A sunny read for a dark winter day!"
2,I wanted to like it more....,"Reading all of the glowing reviews, I realize that I am in the minority on this opinion. I saw a reference to Austen in one of the reviews - I am a huge Jane Austen fan (re-reading the entire collection every few years) and found nothing similar in these characters or the thinly veiled plot line, if it can even be called that. A location that instantly makes everyone nice belongs in the fairy tale or nursery genre. Then all of the typos and errors (hundreds of them) made it almost unreadable."
2,Read the book... but not the Echo Edition,"As others have said, the book itself is charming and wonderfully written... but nearly unreadable. The scannos are rampant. One can usually skip over them and make sense of the story, but in this edition the plot is compromised by the errors. They are so distracting, frequent, and major that it made me crazy.. and really disappointed. I know, I know, you get what you pay for. This one is so good that I'd actually PAY for it, which is high praise indeed from a cheapskate like me. The only good thing about this edition is that someone elses highlights are included in the text, and that someone has chosen a few really pithy, memorable quotes. The irony of this public domain version is that the person responsible for the scanning actually takes ""credit"" (blame?) for her work at the very beginning of the book."
5,The Enchanted April,The Enchanted April. I love this book. About ladies way ahead of their time - before women's lib had come on the scene. Takes place in a rented villa in Italy for one idyllic month in April - ladies vacationing without their husbands and finding themselves.
3,"Good book, lots of typos","Bought this book for my wife - she loves the movie. It contained numerous spelling errors, like it was a rough copy that wasn't edited. Still, my wife said it was readable, and she enjoyed it . I don't know if I would buy from this publisher again without checking the book first."
3,Somewhat underpowered,"This shaver is somewhat underpowered when plugged-in and used normally. Spend your money wisely and get something a little better that may cost a little more. After all, this is a product most guys use everyday and you could easily come to regret your decision (like me!)"
4,good product,My husband likes corded shaver and this is a good deal. I would give it 5 stars if it offers closer shave.
4,Cleaning problem,I love this Phillips razor because it is corded and you do not have to chsrge any batteries as you use it. I had some troubleLearning how to clean it. Fortunately my neighbor had a similar electric razor and he showed me the way to do it.
5,Works great!,"Was happy to locate this razor for my husband; it's like his old one that finally died and they don't make them anymore, but luckily I was able to locate this one thru Amazon. Thanks guys!Hubby is very happy with it."
2,"Started out well, then went downhill","I've been using Norelco electric razors for about 40 years and they have always been fine. This electric razor worked well for about two years, then the shaving head frame and the trimmer broke, so it has turned out to be a real disappointment."
3,Step down in quality but adequate.,"I have been using Norelco products for 50 years. As a child I was fascinated by the floating head technology showing Santa in the TV commercial sledding on the terrain in a floating razor. I have had 10+ years of service from my older models. My last cordless lasted only about 5 years when the battery and the whole motor died. While usually I have stepped up the ladder in purchases, I was disappointed with the early obsolescence of my last razor. Since I never travel with it ( disposables on trips), I had a hard time finding a corded model as replacement. I would have preferred something more substantial, but this item for the price seems adequate though the shaves are not as close. Investing $100+ in a better cordless model doesn't seem a good value. We'll see if this model has any staying power."
2,Not Good,This three circular headed shaver takes much longer than my remington TCT2.I was looking for a better shaver or design.I guess the foil is the best design.
3,ok,"this was given to me by my wife on our anniversary, overall i rate this product ok, though it gives a close shave but due to sensitiveness of my skin i feel itchy entire day. i would not recommend this if your skin is thinny and sensitive, regular razor with shaving gel is far better."
5,A genuine bargain!,"I've been using Norelco shavers for years. This basic model gives me as good a shave as any of them (and certainly a better one than other brands that I've used). Some people might mistake the quiet running motor for a slow running one, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I've been getting fast, close, comfortable shaves without worringing that a rechargeable battery will run out or eventually lose its ability to hold a charge. Considering how high the price of razor blades has gotten this is a genuine bargain."
2,Not as good for me.,I own this shaver and am currently in the market for a new one. I was very surprised to see the overwhelming # of positive reviews for this product. This shaver has been a disappointment since day 1. It pulls hair and does not offer a smooth comfortable shave like more expensive models. Save your $30 and invest it in a nicer shaver.Pros:PriceCons:CordedFlimsy hingePulls hairUncomfortable on neck areaShave not smooth
3,Underpowered,"Guess I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews. I was hoping, since it is a corded model, that it would have a powerfull motor. I have a older Remington rechargable (which is broken which is why I ordered this) that is faster. So far, with new blades, it is shaving pretty good. I have not experienced any ""lift and pull"". Will be interesting to see how it is after the blades dull a bit. Could use a longer cord as well. Still, for $34.00 and free shipping it isn't a bad buy."
1,Not a good product,"Used for exactly 3 weeks, but from day one it was pulling skin. and till the last day it was doing same stuff. Had to return after three weeks"
2,Cord is a problem,"It's not that the shave is terrible for my face, it is rather good, but I personally have a problem with the cord contacts wearing out due to stress on them (I have already gone through 2 different ones), and without the cord, this is just a paperweight."
2,"not bad, not great","pay a little more for the cordless one, the cord is a pain and this model feels pretty cheap. doesn't do a bad job though."
5,Great shaver for the price,"I bought this shaver back in July, and it's still ticking. Relatively quiet, smooth, and so far very reliable. If Amazon would lower their price just a bit (I paid $28 back then in what must have been a computer pricing glitch) then it would be worthwhile buying the thing once a year instead of new replacement blades, which cost almost as much. Even at their current price, it's still worth it."
5,Norelco shaver,It was impossible to find and purchase a norelco shaver that wasn't rechargeable. Norelco's product you offered is perfect!
2,Just alright,My husband received this as a gift. He traded it for a waterproof model. Too time consuming he said. Other than that a good product.
1,Lift and rip out your hair.,"Their ""lift and cut"" system is more like ""lift and rip out your hair"" system. This thing was just plain painful to use, right out of the box. It's also very slow an under powered. I've had rechargable shavers that were much more powerful."
1,Very Weak,"I bought this shaver to replace my husband's last norelco. His last Norelco was purchased in 2000 and worked fine for all these 11 years. When I gave him this one he was impressed that the design was the same except for the collapsable contouring head part. I told him to go into the bathroom and try it...well! I heard it turn on and thought ""Geez! Why does the motor sound so weak-it sounded like a dying battery!"" (And since there are no batteries in this we both were taken aback!) The only positive my husband could say about it is the blades were sharp. That's sad. Looks like I am going to have to shell out more money for a replacement. :("
4,Norelco razor,"Razor is not rechargable like most razors are now. Otherwise, product is very good and service was fast."
1,Need a new power system,I had a Norelco shaver with batteries in the '80 that worked very good and when traving it did its job. Now I do not need a battery power shaver and so I ordered this unit. I do not know where the motor came from but it is so under powered that it can not do the job. The best place for this unit maybe that it can be used on a fishing line.MG
4,Best for the money,"Norelco makes the best electric shaver.Although this particular one is not cordless, it is dual voltage. You can use it any where in the world. It is less than half of the price of the cordless one by Norelco."
4,Clean Shave,"The corded shaver is low priced but gives a more confortable and clean shave than my previous which was 3 times the cost.It is only a month or so old so things could change,but at this point I am very satisfied.Gordon Gerard"
4,Noreleco 110volt shaver,I like a 110 volt electric shaver better than the battery operated ones. The Norelco 6423LC fills this bill for me.
4,Norelco 6423LC,This product is a very good buy and it works great. I am very pleased with this purchase.
1,Wire Falls Out,"I agree with a prior reviewer, It won't keep running unless you cement the plug to the razor with silicon rubber. The female plug is just too small for the hole in the razor and just falls off. The coiled wire provided is too short."
2,Terrible,"I bought this for my husband, not realizing it was not a rechargable razor, but with that aside, it stinks. Has barely enough power to operate. Love the brand but not this razor. My hubby had to start using his old shaver again. Merry christmas."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"I ordered the Norelco 6423LC Corded Reflex Action Shaver, a ""special series"" order and instead was sent a standard 6900 Series. Could have bought what they sent for 50% less.This merchant didn't even have the courtesy to ask if I would accept a substitute. When I called I was told ""too bad"" - ""take it or leave it""!Now they are arguing about taking it back. I have to now dispute the charge through my credit card. They are SWINDLERS! AMAZON WAS NO HELP EITHER! I did not want ot give any stars as a reviewer but it makes you put a least one!"
1,Disappointing,Just used this razor for the first time. Could not get a close shave out of it at all. The trimmer will cut hair but not stubble. On top of all of this it gave me a pretty bad gash. I'm very disappointed in this razor but I guess I got what I paid for. I'm going to order a new razor right now because I can't stand to shave with this one any longer than necessary.
4,Norelco 6423LC Reflex Plus Corded Men's Shaver,It's a nice little shaver for the money. I do not need a fancy rechargeable more expensive razor. This one shaves almost as good as the model HP1602 I used for nearly 30 years before the electric motor finally gave up. If this one lasts half as long I'll be happy. I'll stick with Norelco.
4,Great basic Electric Razor,"I have been a Norelco Electric Razor user for about fifteen years. In fact this new one just replaced my original. When I first received it one month ago I was immediatly skeptical because it said Made in China. My original norelco was made in Holland as was all Norelcos. After using it every day for a month,needless to say, I won't need to pull my old one back out. I'm impressed with how comfortable and easily it takes off my whiskers. The floating head is truly a floating head,not just the blades like my older model. It gets close around my nose and mouth,and there is no irritated skin left behind. If you have never used an electric,give it a try for at least a couple weeks before giving up. It will take that long for your skin to adjust. Don't bear down,but just let the razor do the work,and I'm sure you will enjoy the results. Norelco is easy on the skin. JB"
5,Great For The Price - So What If It Has A Cord,"I have been using these corded Norelcos for years. I buy a new one every so often because it's almost as cheap as the replacement blades. I have tried the more expensive cordless models but the results were the same. I have also tried foil shavers, but they are terrible for me. Fortunately I have electricity in my bathroom (I must be one of the lucky few, judging from the number of corded models available) and I actually like the fact that I don't have to mess with recharging or dead batteries (don't they always seem to die when you need them the most?). Shaving in the car also holds no appeal. So... if you want a decent electric razor for a great price: this is it."
2,Shaver doesn't stay sharp,"The Norelco corded shaver arrived QUICKLY and was EXACTLY what I ordered for my husband. He has been using this shaver for over a decade. The main negative is that the shaver ""blades"" became dull in no time. Sure it shaves fine but NOTHING like it did the first week. Don't know who's providing the rotary blade mechanism but it's really cheap if it doesn't stay sharp during the even the first few months of ownership!"
3,OK shaver while it works,"Notice that this is a ""corded"" shaver. I have it for about an year now but when I was trying to clean it today, it suddenly pop out all the parts and now I'm having big trouble to putting it back. I think next time I will just buy a slightly better model instead of this one. It is made in China and the build quality is just so so. For the price I think it's a good buy but if you are looking for more reliable shaver, I would suggest that you look for other Phillips models."
2,poor excuse,"I've owned Norelco shavers for over 40 years, this has to be the worst of them all!! I would never buy this shaver again!"
1,Philips Norelco has total lack of respect for customers,"Philips Norelco has no grasp of the concept of customer service. They are unable to answer a simple question regarding their own product. They are unwilling to lift a finger to try to find out the answer or assist a customer in any way. I guess it hasn't dawned on them that their income comes from customers and that customers who are treated rudely will not continue to buy their products.As for the product itself, it's nothing special. Short corded, half A'd shaver. Lot's of companies make them, some for less. Some probably even have customer service."
3,Nice but read carefully,THIS IS A CORDED SHAVER . I made the mistake of assuming that all shavers come with a Battery . other than that its a pretty decent shaver
4,electric Razor,I Like the item very much but wish it had a traveling case to available and it was included.
5,Great Item,"I have purchased this item as a gift for my husband. He hates shaving so he puts it off for a week before he shaves again. He liked this shaving system because it is used on dry skin, which makes it easy to do everyday, a minute and he is done. It shaves closer than other brands. Plus, because it is corded, it is always at the same power. He had other systems before but he always managed to lose the charger somewhere!"
2,Can't beat the old stuff,"The razor is just ""OK"". It seems to lack power. My old Norelco, which still works by the way, is still running strong."
4,Works great!,"This item works as advertised, but I think I could have spent the same by buying it at Target. Quick delivery!"
5,excellent little shaver,i bought this shaver after forgetting my own at a friends house while on a visit. i like this one so much that i told my friend not to waste money shipping me the forgotten one.
3,Not to bad at all,I really ordered this item more or less for the shears on the back rather than the razors on the front. Good thing after all. It takes a few passes to be 100% successful. Never the less for the cost I for one am happy...
3,cords too short,a good shave at a reansonable pricecorded i wouldnt buy it if it wasnt cordedhowever its too short needs a longer cord
4,Great Shaver,"This is an excellent electric shaver at a bargain price. It is compact, lightweight and works well. The only detraction is that there is no carrying case."
4,Another great piece of work by Gackt,"I've just recently began to be a fan of Gackt, but I'm so hooked!I love""SecretGarden"" not only because I enjoy rock, but because it was so beautiful, even without music. But then again, that's just how Gackt's style is. He's not like other stars who are famous for their songs and lyrics, he's got such a great voice and you can tell how much emotion he puts into it. Very good!"
3,Meh,"I'm not really a rock fan, and this is one CD I was dissapointed in. After I had bought several of Gakuto's CDs I figured I should try this one out. The sound of it was to loud and irritating for my ears. But still, they have good lyrics. I only gave this three stars because of his voice, but I had to put the CD on low."
3,"Nice Mix of Culture, History, Mystery, & Intrigue","The book is an interesting mix of culture, history, fine wine, mystery and intrigue. The author has a knack for weaving these together in an interesting way. The background for the book is a technology company that revolutionizes the advertising industry but the real story is about people and power. The author takes the reader to Spain for most of the action which is interesting. There were also some surprises at the end that kept it from being predictable. I found it quite entertaining."
5,Chris LeDoux - Live,"Great Live set. Chris the rock singer shines on ""Cadillac Ranch"", ""Hooked On An 8 Second Ride"", ""For Your Love"", ""Little Long-Haired Outlaw"", he is also very comfortably traditional with tunes like ""Whatcha Gonna Do With A Cowboy"" (without Garth this time), and ""Copenhagen Angel"". He can be soft on ""Riding For A Fall"" and ""You Can't See Him From The Road"". Chris LeDoux and his Western Underground band are in good shape and they prove it here. You just wish you had been there to see the show."
1,How big is it?,I want to buy the book for my elementary art class and I can't find anywhere in the descriptions if they are the same size as the origionals.
2,"Nice Picture, but unreliable","We purchased this projector in October and within 6 months of very limited use, 2 white vertical lines appeared on the display. This was covered under warranty (which does not include shipping there or back). Now after another 6 months, again with only limited use, the 2 white lines are back. They show up even when no source is connected so I know it is the projector and not coming from the source. If you want a projector you can depend on, unfortunately this one is not it.Overall, the projector has a great picture. We primarily connect it to a DVD player or HDTV input and when it is working it works great but I don't like the fact that it needs repaired twice in the first year."
4,Ice at Heart by Sophie Weston (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:""You're expecting me to stay with you in a house that's an hour's walk from the nearest bar of chocolate?"" Gaby hadn't wanted to come to Sweden and give Dr. Sven Hedberg music therapy, so the realisation that she would be alone with the broodingly handsome brain surgeon was doubly hard to take! However, her father's reputation was at stake, so she must at least try to help Sven - but who would help her ... ?"
5,Epic house and trance.....!,"This is the second volume of the ""Ibiza Euphoria"" series, which is mixed by one of the distinguished pioneers of the Ibiza scene, not to mention the founder of ""XTRAVAGANZA"" uk record label,...Alex Gold, whose distinct progressive, cosmopolitan global dance sound has overwhelmed and won the heart of thousands of clubbers all over the world. The second disc is mixed by Agnellie and Nelson, also a protege of Alex Gold's Xtavaganza line. The first cd starts out with smooth solid house,and then progressing to trance, with the exclusive ""Katcha Remix"" of Solar Stone's ""Seven Cities""...All in all, this item is truly a masterpiece. I cannot compare it to the first volume which was mixed by Matt Darey, since I feel both have a unique distinct style all of its own."
5,One of the top trance cds out there,CD 2 is right up there with oakenfold's resident on my trance classics list. Starts great then after #10 takes it up a level. this is good stuff!
3,OK basic information but there's a lot missing,"This guide lists more than just the most competitive colleges; it even lists those that are just moderately competitive. It is just basic information, however. There is a lot about admissions and costs, but that's about it. There isn't much on student life, academics, etc. There are also schools that, inexplicably, are missing. For example, there were no profiles of Clark University, Ohio University, Dickinson College, Occidental College and other very reputable schools. There are better guides but for quick information of grades and test scores for admitted applicants, this guide is fairly good."
5,Great to know what is going on in the World,"Excellent book although written some decades ago incredibly remain updated because of the universal explanations based on systems interactions, ie, human systems interactions.Why we are more prone to be negative and how to become a more positive society.Dr. de Bono introduce by the first time new concepts that help understand human nature.He place ideas that are further developed in more modern books like simplicity.Why be positive about our future?Find out your answer by reading the book.I can say to you that the quality of our future will depend on the quality of our thinking."
5,AWESOME!!!ONE OF THE BEST EVER...,Inquilaab in my opinion is the best junoon album and one of the best ever released in asia.. or anywhere in the world for that matter..its original.. blends east and west like nothing else.. i bought it 6 years ago and i still listen to it.. each and every song is awesome in this album.. i would recommend it to anyone who loves music..
4,HOW SWEET THE SOUND IS!,"IF THIS BOX SET ONLY HAD THE SONG ""MIDNIGHT SUN"", THAT IN ITSELF WOULD BE WORTH THE PRICE. THIS SONG IS SO BEAUTIFULLY DONE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE OTHER GREAT SONGS AS WELL LIKE ""LAURA"", ""THAT'S ALL"", ""RUBY"", ""IF HE WALKED INTO MY LIFE"". ALL DONE IN THE BEAUTIFUL RELAXING SERENE STYLE THAT THE JACKIE GLEASON ORCHESTRA IS KNOWN FOR."
5,Smoother than a fine english gin martini,"I heard my friend playing this cd at work and was immediately arrested by its smooth tones. Who would have thought a guy like Mr. Gleason would have put this little gem together. You took me to the moon Jackie, to the moon!!!!"
1,Waste of money,"I have used several video and books for many different instruments, and this is the worst thought out instructional video I have ever seen. It is basically Schatz rambling on without any real plan. He goes through things so quickly and disorganized that you can't follow it. And since there is no book there nothing to go back to except trying to find the spot in the video again. I found this incredibly frustrating. After this one, I don't think I will ever buy an instructional video without a book to go along with it. I feel like I have been had on this. Definitely not worth the big price tag."
1,Vector VEC 142 - beware,"I have never written a bad review, but don't want others to have to go thru what I did. The light never even took a charge - called the manufacturer, they said I had to take it in to an authorized service center, which is an hour away from me - this was after spending an hour on the phone, getting directed to the right person to tell me that. What a disappointment - but guess that's why I got such a good price, should have known better."
1,"I really hate to trash anything I get for this price, but....","I bought this light a couple of months ago thinking it would be a good worklight for my furniture refinishing projects in the basement. When it arrived everything was in good condition. It was new in the packaging, with no evidence of bumps or dings, no evidence that it might be an old product. I opened it and read the directions for charging it and plugged it in. Nothing ever happened. I don't know if the battery is old...I don't know if the wall charger is dead...I just don't know. Anyhow, by the time I discovered this I had passed the warranty period and decided it was just a badly spent $29. I would suggest taking it out of the packaging immediately and charging it and not waiting. I still haven't tried to charge it in my car, so I haven't gotten rid of it, but I'm a little bummed and have procrastinated even further. It sits on my living room floor, just waiting for it's last chance. Wish me luck!"
1,Never Worked,"This product never worked out the box. After trying to charge the battery in different outlets for days, I mailed it back to the company for a refund."
4,Artension definatly have there own sound,"Clocking in at just 49 minutes I would regard this as a short prog metal cd. It lacks in art production and does not include any lyrics . The music is at the best I`ve heard this band do and the keyboards (Vitalig Kuprij) are so good that they put a smile on my face. John West once again sounds fantastic and the drummer (Shane Gaalaas) is a drummers drummer, he is...great.The songs are well writen but the music surpases the song writingits very melodic and highly progressive neo Bach with a similar overall feel to perhaps Symphony X , however with that said Artension definatly have there own sound. The only other Artension CD I own is (Forces of nature) while its very good I think progressivly speaking this is the stronger of the two, however the song writing and structure is better on Forces of nature."
2,Too good to be true,"These treats don't last, my dog can pop them out in a matter of minutes, and it's completely gone in about 5 minutes. Add to that the seller I purchased from only sent me one (they come in packs of 2, seller opened it and only sent me one treat), I was very disappointed. Never going to bother with these again."
5,Keeps my doggies entertained!,"Both of my chihuahua mutts love these inserts. I use the treat in a bendo ball for one and she's busy for hours! The other pooch doesnt like the bendo ball but loves this treat. He eats it in about 10 minutes.Def will stock up on these. Especially seeing as the dog that likes the treat in the ball is the more demanding of entertainment than the other - who is contented by just sitting next to me and snugglling.I just wish they were a bit less expensive, however, it's worth the price for a happy (ie. not bored) dog."
4,"Everlasting Treat for Dogs, Vanilla Mint, Large",My dog seems to like these. He will not stop until all gone. You can smell item while he is eating it. Would buy again but not often cause of cost and they only last him about an hour and a half.
4,Dogs love them,"Our dogs really seem to love these, but they seem to be softer than the others so they are able to wear them down faster than the other flavors we have used. Great product though and really keep the dogs entertained"
2,"I Don't Know If You Could Call It ""Vanilla Mint""","It fits the right ball and it is just as ""everlasting"" as the other disks, but I really don't think this smells at all like vanilla or mint."
3,So hard to get in,"I bought these for my 100 lb lab/shepherd mix and the first one he got out within 5 minutes. I takes me about 10 minutes to get the stupid things in! I have to use a screwdriver to get it in the ball. Unless I have the time to get the large and medium ones in the toys, it's not worth the trouble. If my lab mix can't get the treat out, he tends to give up and leave it for our smaller dog to just lick. Wish there was an easier way to get the treats in-if anyone knows of one, please let me know!"
1,MY DOG HATED THEM,"My little dog wouldn't even lick it, she isn't going to even get close to it. Beware! She loves her treats and I was hoping after reading the other reviews that it would be good for her and her breath, but what a waste of $5. So frustrated!Just a friendly warning, you might have to send them back."
3,Incomprehensible,"I know its meant to be experimental writing that plays with meaning and such, and I'm normally pretty open, but this is just gay sex, more gay sex, and more gay sex, with a plot that twists, meanders, and repeats itself."
5,Borghese Cura treatment,"Another terrific product. I recommend. I use it on my dog's feet at night a few times a week during periods when she's been playing rough. A little goes a long way. I am not saying we don't waste some of it. But the per use application cost is actually not too bad. She tolerates it well. No desire to lick it off. For good hygienic practices, of course, one shouldn't share a product used on the dog. So I haven't tried it myself except insofar as to feel it on my hands when applying it to her little toes. Then I wash my hands. The dog is 40 pounds, mixed breed, short hair, golden color plus white, hound mix, always groomed, and a very gentle and trim canine. She appreciates the care."
2,"Product is wonderful, seller is questionable","I've been using Borghese Cura C for years. I love the product, however, I have to question the seller and their price. On every other site I've checked this product retails for 68.00 dollars. Their price is listed as half that which makes me wonder how old it is. I fell for this one with Beautyrose and the product was rancid. I did NOT receive any resolution after a flurry of emails and I will never buy Borghese from them again."
2,"Really folks, not that funny........","I had high expectations for this book, something on the order of ""Selling Ben Cheever"" or ""A Working Stiff's Manifesto."" Both of those books had a biting sense of humor, but they were also insightful about the world of work and the confusing sense of identity that comes from frequent job loss and career shifts. ""Loser Goes First,"" however, is heavy on smarm and self-satisfaction, and provides little to no insight either about the author or the uncertain workplace. I would categorize this book as yet another installment of the ""Slacker Chronicles,"" whereby writers with style to spare and not a lot of relevance or depth, tell about their lives as if we should automatically find them interesting. I'm not kidding when I say that I didn't so much as chuckle, and instead only finished the book because it was short enough not to be a burden. Given the press, I'd say this is a highly overrated piece of fluff."
4,Very Funny,"This the author's second book. It's an episodic memoir that is equal parts hilarious and embarrassing things that the author has been through. In most of the chapters Kennedy takes on different dream jobs/get-rich-quick-schemes that sound good at first but that he's unwilling to put the work and effort into. I laughed out loud during a number of parts, particularly when he decides he wants to be professional Bass fisherman"
1,Paper Lanterns don't stay on,"I got these for a party and never successfully assembled or displayed them. I kept reading the elusive instructions trying to figure out what I did wrong and I came to the conclusion that it's not me, it's the paper lanterns! When/if you purchase these, you will receive a string of lights as well as the little paper lanterns that are flattened. It is your job to expand the paper lanterns (easy enough) and attach them to the string of lights (impossible). The problem is that there is no way to attach them so they stay on! I ripped several of the little paper lanterns in the process of trying to get them to stay on and threw the rest in a corner after getting extremely frustrated with them. They've never been assembled or displayed, unfortunately. Do not buy these, they are a complete waste of your money and energy!"
4,pretty good,"I bought this with the intention of decorating the top of my room, that meant I had to get an extension cord for it, I sort of wished that the product would be offered along side a set of really long extension cords. They look very pretty but I found it a pain to set them up, especially with the lanterns made of paper(too easy to destroy that paper covering)."
1,May As Well Buy An Empty Box,"I couldn't get any use out of this software. The manual was brief, (excessively concise), it wasn't clearly written. More of the manual was taken up by foreign languages than anything else, a wasted opportunity to tell me something useful. The manual told me that it would wipe out any pre-existing files on my destination backup disk. I could find no way to backup my C:\ hard drive to my second serial hard drive, which has other stuff on it that I didn't want to be wiped out. The program asked me if I wanted to install drivers for my CD-RW drive, and when I clicked ""Yes"" I was told that it only covered Windows 95 and 2000, saying nothing about Windows '98. An empty box would be a better purchase!!"
1,Junk,"Not compatible with Mac 9.1 with INTERNAL CD-RW DRIVE. Macintosh blames Dantz, and Dantz blames Macintosh."
3,Good film,I enjoyed this film. It is a low budget project and the acting is a bit predictable but the story line is good.
1,What is all the fuss about?,"Dear Reader,If you're a fan of the western genre steer well clear of this hocus pocus.It feels like it was written by O.Henry in drag.Gothic, British telemundo and death . . . writ large.I'd like to write more but disappointment overwhelms me.B. Marvin"
4,Good start to an outstanding series,"Sin Killer was a good start to an outstanding series by Larry McMurtry. It was perhaps just a little better than the third book in the series, and possibly not quite as good as the second. I found once again, as in Comanche Moon, that the Amerindian characters were quite well done, although not quite as well as CM. The Sin Killer was a very interesting character, and Tasmin was also a well-developed and compelling personality. McMurtry did an excellent job of re-creating the American West in the early 1830's and showing just how dangerous conditins were at that time. The beginning of the book was a little bit slow, but once a reader gets past the first 15 or 20 pages, she will be rewarded with excellent prose, a dynamic plot, and fine characterizations. I recommend this book highly, although not as highly as Comanche Moon."
4,SOME GOOD STUFF FROM THE WESTERN CHRONICLER,"Larry McMurtry's latest series takes the reader to the plains of the frontier and, true to form, incorporates a variety of actual history into the story.Meet the Berrybender clan, one of the most interesting and dysfunctional groups ever tackled by the famed western author.If you like McMurtry's other books, especially Boone's Lick, you will appreciate this one. Not as good as the Lonesome Dove series (but then, what is?), The Berrybender Narratives are, nonetheless, destined to be western classics. Read this one and then get Book 2: The Wandering Hill."
2,Fehhhhh... Gross family with Gross ways...You've been warned,"This is my first McMurtry novel. I have never read ""Lonesome Dove"" and all I can say, is why would anyone write about such a bombastic abusive, and disturbing family as the Berrybenders?...About the only interesting part for me was the ""Buffalo Man"" storyline... Other than that, I was sadly disappointed by tale. The Berrybender's were a vastly unappealing bunch."
1,Zane Grey on Drugs,"If this is to be a four part series, McMurty should have given this one to us for free. What a mess. This book is like Zane Grey on drugs."
1,Book Gone Bad,The book Sin Killer is not a very good. The book is pretty much pointless. In Sin Killer it did not give very much information and it was not clear. It talked about where they were going but the author jumped around on many subjects. The author would be talking about one thing then all of the sudden he would be talking about else. I would reccommend this book to people that are older mature and can read very well. I think this book was more written for adults than young adults. This book was mainly about a girl who moved to America. When they got there they bought a steamboat and started to travel the rivers of the west. It talks about what goes on the in the wild west and the adventures they have. This bookis best suited for adults.
3,ROLL ON McMURTRY,"It is difficult to argue with the publishing success of McMurtry or with his continuing saleability based on the earlier LONESOME DOVE. What one might argue with is the borderline fantasy with which the author rolls off characters from his arch pen, or arch word processor, whichever the case may be. It is these slighted characters who are so stock dimensional and thereby faulty and not so much the story narrative-- splashed out on the broad canvas of easily managed frontier and western myth-- though the latter in its glib effrontery sometimes offends as well."
1,Saccharine Drivel,"McMurtry has always relied on cuteness, but some of his books have had other, redeeming qualities. In this book absolutely nothing else is going on. Up to page one hundred, when I gave up, not one of the many characters had uttered a believable line of dialogue or exhibited a plausible reaction to any situation. I'm not sure what McMurtry intended, but this book with its mostly English cast ends up seeming like a second rate, unfunny imitation of P.G. Wodehouse."
1,Vastly disappointed !,"Just finished reading SIN KILLER by McMurtry. I have always enjoyed read his books but was greatly disappointed in his latest endeavor. There seems little if any plot or story line and his attempts at farce fall far short in my mind. If this is an example of the first book of his tetralogy, you can definitely count me out as far as reading any further volumes in this series.The characters in the book don't a semblance of establishing any personality---they are shallow, predictable, and without any substance in my opinion.I'm disappointed in McMurtry and wonder if he is trying to make it on his name and past writings with this current series."
1,A dissapointment,"An unfocued annoying cast of characters. It has none of the magic, none of the bigger than life sense of place of Lonesome Dove. Mr. McMurty should have stopped and rested on the laurels of having created the Western equivilent of a Gone With the Wind classic in Lonesome Dove.Now his new novel leaves you with a sense of embarassment to have spent nearly twenty bucks on a book that didn't deliver a good read. From the history angle of the Western Genre, Sin Killer offers little to be believed. It offers the type of writing you expect from a first time writer, not the craftsman McMurty proved he was with Lonesome Dove."
1,Stop at book one.,"I also loved ""Lonesome Dove"". So I bought ""Sin Killer"". I did not expect another ""Lonesome Dove"", however I did expect something better than what I got. ""Sin Killer"" is one of the few books that I did not finish. I got just over half way through and gave up. It was pointless, and poorly written with no depth to the characters, none of which had any redeeming qualities. If you must read this book, get it from the library don't buy it. My mother an avid reader did, and she quit about two thirds of the way through. At least she saved her money.A note to Mr. McMurtry. When you sit down to write the rest of the ""Sin Killer"" tetralogy....don't."
3,"A ,(not so sure at first), good read","This English family, the Berrybenders, are out in the middle of the plains on a paddleboat making their way up a river, just so the father can hunt. They are very rich, have lots of various types of children, and very snobbish. They have brought servants, guides, an artist, and many cases of booze. They run into many perils. By the end of the book I was throughly hooked. Ran out and got the second narrative, called The Wandering Hill."
3,Haven't I read this before.,"I like McMurtry's books but after a while the characters seem to crawl from book to book, shape-changers, offering the same clipped lines, bits of wisdom, winsome quirks and oddly funny situations.If you enjoy his stories and characters by all means read Sin Killer, but other than setting, don't count on anything new."
1,Really Bad Writing,"This novel is a real dissappointment, especially from an award-winning author. The characters are not only uniformly unlovable, but also two dimensional characteratures. The story is not helped by a series of major historical bloopers in the first chapters - one in which a little boy wishes that his big sister could be bitten by a mosquito so ""she could die of malaria."" This in the 1830's decades before anyone had any idea of the connection. Later the author,in two places, has the aristocratic lord valuing his daughters only for the large doweries they would bring in. It doesn't take a student of English history to know that dowery refers to the amount of property required to marry a girl off, and that a young English girl's matrimonial prospects rose and fell on the amount she could bring with her. Perhaps McMurty is confusing this with the Arab world and ""bride price.""In short bad writing, worse editing, a dull story. If you have to read it at least wait for the paperback."
2,superficial . . .,"And no, that isn't a compliment! I have loved most of McMurtry's books, but I wasn't sure I could hang with this one. The characters seem to have no real motivation. They act and speak like cardboard--what a change from McMurtry's usual style. It's just hard to imagine real people behaving in the ridiculous way they do in this book--their sexual conduct, their relationships with one another; they are all caricatures. Perhaps this is his point--his way of poking fun of British aristocrats? If you're used to getting to know McMurtry's down-to-earth, ring-true characters and seeing their inner desires and motivations, this book will not satisfy. At the end of most of McMurtry's books, I'm sad to say goodbye to the characters--but not this bunch."
1,Hugely disappointing!,"After enjoying McMurtry's masterpiece ""Lonesome Dove,"" I had high expectations for this book. However, I can honestly say that it is one of the worst books I have had the misfortune of reading. The numerous characters are unlikely caricatures and the rapidly occurring events are equally ridiculous. There is never an opportunity to understand or care about any of the main characters, and each surprising turn left me rolling my eyes and wishing the book would simply end and spare me the trouble. The tongue-in-cheek language used both in the narrative and in the dialogue suggest that it was meant to be a farce, but the plot unfolds with such ponderous self-importance that I wonder what the author could possibly have been thinking."
1,Sin Killer = Sanity Killer or Insomnia Killer,"This book was just plain awful. So awful that I want the time I spent reading it back. I mean can I sue someone for suffering through this awful read? Most likely I cannot not, but I can warn others. So that is what I will do. The book try to accomplish what was done with Lonesome Dove, and that is getting the reader firmly in the grip of a story that is so interesting that they will purchase the succeeding books in the franchise. The Berrybinders left me wishing they were all dead, hell tortured for all the pain they caused me in this book. It was great prose, but even great pose cannot give life to a stillborn story. Avoid this one, and keep a few hours of your life from being wasted."
1,ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"After reading throuugh 2 chapters I gave up on Sin Killers. THe British names are to difficult for me to pronounce. I just could not stay interested in the book. Unfortunately, I purchased the other 2 books in this series as well.Next time I want to buy a book I'll read the customer reviews. Seems this book has a lot of negative reviews."
2,Unpleasant Prairie shenanigans!,"Well, I am a big fan of the McMurtry oeuvre and some of his signature elements are here in this book series. He has a certain style that is unmistakeable--and in this case he seems to be trying to parody himself. There was enough to hook me to read this, and in a pinch read the second book, but there were times I was skimming portions of this book.The main things to dislike were that the characters were mostly selfish and upleasant. It was hard to find anyone to like. The plot was not very interesting. It left me feeling unsatisfied."
3,Sardonic look at the Old West,"I needed something to kill time while traveling and this book did the trick. The author attempts and delivers a fine western from the view of a multifacted character line up that included a British family, Native-Americans, Cowboys, and other people that made this book interesting. While this is certainly not his best work, this is a good book.The character development is good, but there are so many characters to remember I had to continually look back at the cast of players to remember who the author was talking about. I think, though many were killed in the first book, as the series progresses, the characters will become more familiar.Overall, a solid B of a bookJoseph Dworak"
2,eh,"I have read A LOT of Mcmurtry's novels, but this one I like the least, which is odd, because I think I might be the only person. :) I love the rest of the books, just not this one. I actually got bored reading it. A lot of people compare the characters as dynamic as those in Lonesome Dove, but I was VERY disappointed when I actually read it, and they came no where close. I didn't fall in love with these characters, and although there were some real neat situations they got themselves into, it wasn't as gripping as some of his other books. Things were amusing like Lord Berrybender continually losing limbs, but I dunno. The way it ended it sounded like the one after this one might be better and more interesting. I love all other Mcmurtry books though! Particularly the Lonesome Dove Tetralogy, Zeke & Ned and Boones Lick."
2,Very disappointing,"McMurtry's latest novel is set in 1832, as a familial band of English nobility and their sizable group of retainers set forth on the Missouri River for an adventure. The novel's theme of Old World meets New World is glaringly obvious, and as shallow as the river on which it is set. The characters most often are caricatures - at time I thought, ""Was this written by Monty Python?"" Nevertheless, McMurtry's lyric pen and ability to conjure up the geography of this once unspoilt country are intact.Sin Killer is the first of a planned tetralogy (four books), and one can only hope that theis master of Western frontier fiction returns to form in the remaining books."
1,Sin Killer,"I just read Sin Killer and was very disappointed. At times I was tempted to just put it down. I loved Lonesome Dove, both the book and the movie, the book was best, and was really let down with this one. I will read other works by McMurtry though because of the outstanding Lonesome Dove."
3,Mildly amusing,"This is a lot like Abbott and Costello times six go west. The comedic acts of the Berrybender family are numerous and many are amusing if not believable. What was most disappointing about the book was the abruptness of the ending. While I went into knowing it was the first installment of a series, the events didn't come to any sort of reasonable stopping place and events seemed more to be lopped off with a cleaver. I read many series and I don't recall any of them having ended so abruptly. Still, I confess, I will be reading on. The Sin Killer, Jim Snow, does have a certain magnetism that will keep my reading on."
1,Only buy this if you have a table with a short leg...,"Yes, I know it's supposed to be satire.Yes, the dialogue is delightful and quaint.Yes, Larry McMurtry (who's written more screenplays and novels than God himself) is the author.That doesn't magically transform ""Sin Killer"" into a good book.I got this is a gift, so I spent no money on it, but I *still* feel cheated. If you've ever read McMurtry, skip this book; it will shake your faith--usually well-earned--in his writing. If you're not familiar with McMurtry's works, don't read this; it's not at all representative of his genius.I'm going to re-read ""Lonesome Dove"" just to get the bad taste out of my mouth from ""Sin Killer""."
1,sad effort,"I've read nearly all of Larry McMurtry's books, so obviously I'm a big fan of his. But what happened here?? The characters are more caricatures than characters, the premise ludicrous, the scenes unbelievable. I shudder to think that there are three more books to come in this series that is so wasteful of a brilliant writer's talent. Larry, your time could be better spent."
2,Not the Usual McMurtry caliber,"After reading this novel, I had to ask myself ""why was this ever even published?"" I've enjoyed McMurtry novels immensely over the years and was horribly disappointed in this piece of rubbish. The characters are simply bizarre and as a whole evoke no emotional response from the reader. The plot is childishly simple and, although at times humorous through folly, not specifically engaging. Barely 300 pages (and that's with careful formatting), it's obvious ""Sin Killer"" was churned out to simply make a deadline and is not a true effort from a highly talented writer. There are many much better Larry McMurty novels. Forget this one and go try something else."
2,Very disappointing!,"Having read and enjoyed earlier works of McMurtry, I looked forward to this new series. However, after about 100 pages into this one (I kept hoping it would get better), I decided it wasn't worth my time. Poor character development and mediocre diaglogue certainly were factors. But having to read on almost every page about which characters were sleeping together or lusting after each other got to be downright boring!"
2,Save Your Money.,"Fortunately for me, "" Lonsome Dove"" was the first McMurtry book I read. To this day it is one of the best books ever read by anyone. It's first sequel was a nine, the co-written ""Zeke and Ned"" is also a keeper. Because of ""Lonesome Dove"", I have read or tried to read most of McMurtry's work, looking for even a bit of the brilliance that was in LD. With that hope, I purchased all four of the Berrybender series. All were read, cover to cover, and there were a few good moments. But overall, I'd like to have the time back and spend it searching for something well written. Larry McMurtry should block all calls from his publisher, take some time off to find himself and then do for us, what he does best when he is at his best. J. Crockett, Librarian retired."
2,No Lonesome Dove,"It was a bummer for me. I expected more good story telling like Lonesome Dove, Commanche Moon and Dead Man's Walk. Was I disappointed! Then it just stops almost in mid paragraph.There were also so many characters that I had to keep flipping back to the page he gave us with all the characters. Now I know why he had to do that."
2,An unlovable bunch,This is certainly no Lonesome Dove. McMurtry is one of my favorite authors but this book was a disappointment. While the characters are interesting and diverse they all share one common trait: they are all extremely unlovable. I like to have at least one character that I can care about in some way. So far there are none in this story. Perhaps he is waiting for the next three books to bring out someone's good qualities.
3,Self-parody??,"First volume of 3 in The Berrybinder Narrative. This time it's the West of 1832, and an eccentric family from Europe is venturing up the Missouri River and encounters all kinds of adventures. Thus it's yet another version of LONESOME DOVE, at least in form, but it's much weaker - McMurtry is almost parodying himself. Halfway through the Lonesome Dove series of novels, McMurtry said he no longer cared about the characters. From his subsequent writing, especially when concerned with the Old West, it's obvious his statement contains a great deal of truth. If so, why does he continue to write novels like this? This book is a big comedown for McMurtry."
1,A false and degraded West,"Mr. McMurtry continues his agenda of prostituting and degrading this great land's history. In his early days, he restricted himself to debasing small West Texas towns. But he is a prolific writer and over the years has falsely painted his own ugliness across most of this country's past, from the Rio Bravo to the Canadas and from the Missouri to the Rockies. He mines true history and uses small truths to beguile the city reader with a false view of our heritage. This book seems merely an attempt to degrade the story of the Missouri River. If you love your past and the truth about it, this book will not speak to your heart."
2,Not My Kind of Read via McMurtry,"I find it difficult to be critical of any of McMurtry's efforts, but this book was so foreign to what I had expected, so much so, that I disliked the foolish characters and their ridiculous behavior. Some have said it is ""black comedy,"" and I expect that is what it is, since one cannot take these characters seriously. Frankly, I am disappointed. I can't imagine how the second book of the series can improve on this one. I will first read reviews.Evelyn Horan - authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book OneJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Book Two"
5,Wild adventure!,Larry McMurtry brings the West alive with this wild adventure! There's a touch of romance and humor and it's well worth the read!
3,"aaaaaahhhh, duh?","I consider myself to be an average educated individual, with a high school diploma and 2 years of college, but I was lost in this book. The story seemed good, but the large words were superfluous, excessive, and unnecessary. 99% of the time I can gain an associative meaning from sentence context, but there were so many unknown words in a given sentence that even THAT was impossible. It got too cumbersome to read, so I'm sorry to say that my review is only on half of the book. Larry, stay away from the Thesaurus in your word processor, as it cannot advise you that related words are archaic and obsolete.Tracy"
3,Hopefully a prologue,"3 stars only because McMurtry off his game still is pretty good. The whole thing reads like the first part of a larger book. That kind of makes sense since this is the first book of a series. The result however, is that this one seems very imcomplete, even shallow. Anyone of the Lonesome Dove series could have stood on its own. That's not the case with this one. The following books in this series will need to be stronger to save this one."
5,Enjoyable Read,"I quite liked the craziness of the people, places and events. I found this book an easy and enjoyable read and look forward to the next one"
4,Called pop...but this is NEW WAVE baby!,"This volume in the series really should have been called Maximum New Wave volume 2. My only disappointment with this volume is that we get the album version of French Kissin by Deborah Harry instead of the true 12"" remix!!! Track times:1. such a shame (7:00)2. the war song (6:18)3. the reflex (6:32)4. In private (7:12)5. hit me with your rhythm stick (6:49)6. French kissin (5:05)7. we close our eyes (6:02)8. let me go (6:13)9. love blonde (5:00)10. 80s romance (6:47)"
1,Disappointed!,The sound quality of this speaker reminds me of an old hand held transistor AM radio. It sounds kinda cheap. If I had to do over again I would look at other products.
4,Good So Far,"I just received my set of these speakers. The volume is good for its size but better with some songs than others. There is one con so far. With the speakers, the FM radio on my Sansa doesn't work very well at all. I'm planning to use the headphones instead of the speakers when I want to listen to the radio. Other than that, the speakers seem to be well made, and the size is nice. Overall, it is a good deal."
5,Great Book,An excellant overall view. I got it for a class and will keep it forever. Please get a copy ASAP.
5,Fantastic coverage of a fantastic artist.,"The book listed on this page, a monograph on Jenny Holzer by Phaidon Press, is fabulous. It contains information on Holzer's wide and influential art career, from her Truisms posters of the 'seventies to her electronic LED signs, carved stone benches, and virtual art pieces of the 'nineties.This book is also unique, within the Holzer bibliography, because of the ""Artist's Choice"" section where Holzer provides excerpts from books and writings that have influenced her, along with explanations of why she's moved by them.If you're interested in modern art, or women artists, this is a must-read"
2,Battery Troubles,"Even on a full charge the battery will only last for about 15 minutes. It works good for those 15 minutes. Solid sucking action and great portability, but only for about 15 minutes. Then you have to charge the battery for about 4 hours to get another 15 minutes. Apparently this model is also off the market so replacements are impossible to come by and the manufacturer is no help. I'd say avoid this manufacturer."
1,This vacuum is really terrible,"Even though I read the negative reviews on here I purchased this vacuum because Amazon had it at $8, so I thought what the heck. Well I wish I had my $8 back. I should have saved the box and returned it. I could not tell you about the battery life because the sucking power is so poor I only used it for a couple of minutes. I was hoping that this would be useful for spot cleaning the cars instead of plugging in the shop vac, but it is really just a waste of time. The only thing I use it for now is to walk around real quick in the house to vacuum up spot of dog hair here and there off the hardwood floors."
4,Helpful Pocket Atlas but flawed,"I have been using John Tauranac's Manhattan Street Atlas and it is very helpful, but flawed. The binding is such, that the book cannot be fully opened, so information in the center cannot be retrieved, unless one cracks-open the binding.This is the most annoying flaw. Also, many things were omitted. For example, 515 Madison Ave. is the DuMont Building, but no mention is made of that fact. I had to research that building over the Internet to get it's name.Other interesting buildings go un-named,too. I was surprised that the monument where Peter Minuet supposedly sold Manhattan for $24 in Inwood Hill Park, is also omitted; as are other interesting monuments. Finally, I'd like buildings under construction to be named,e.g. Bloomberg Tower, etc. Overall, it's the best detailed guide to Manhattan out there, and I recommend it."
5,fantastic - my saviour in the big apple!,"Alone in New York for three months with no idea where your apartment is let alone working out which direction North is when emerging from the depths of the subway - this map was a god send. Even once i had caught on to the grid system (london is much less sensible in its planning!) My head would have been spinning without it on my many errands through the back streets of Soho and Nolita. Truley fantastic, it even has some of the main addresses on it. So you are free to stroll through manhattan in complete confidence rather than staring up desparingly at the emcompassing skyscrapers with no idea what a cross street is!"
5,Great grips,"These grips are great for long rides - so far have kept my fingers from tingling. I installed this with a Kuryakyn Contoured Throttle Boss and it has made a huge difference over stock grips. On an '08 Heritage Softail, they were easy to install and look great. With addition of the contoured throttle boss from Powersports Superstore, it was still cheaper than the kit that comes with the smaller throttle boss and the bigger paddle on the contoured one doesn't seem to get in the way but adds a lot more comfort over the long ride than the smaller one seemed to."
3,good but all previouly released,"would be a 4 star review but everything has been released over and over again. Basically ""Genocide"" is the first 2 Judas Priest albums (Rocka Rolla & Sad Wings of Destiny)on a 2 CD set. it has a bonus track ""Diamonds And Rust"" which is a different version than on ""Sin After Sin"" but it is the same as on ""Hero Hero"" which was another collection of the first 2 albums released in 84. so if you are a Priest fan and don't already have the first 2 albums, this is a good deal because its cheaper than buying them separetly. If you already have the songs, there is nothing new."
1,"Great Sound, but a problem with the master tape","I also mentioned this under the remastered version of Sad Wings. Same problem on this disc.The master tape speeds up about 3:23 into Island of Domination for a sec or 2, then resume normal speed. Too bad really, because the sound quality is great.Recall 2CD (a Snapper Music label) 2000, SMD CD 273"
2,mediocre compilation goes on and on,"This album made me realize that darn record company produces, for examle, two regular albums; two best albums; two tribute albums; and finally two mixture of everything under a sounds-like-new-but-actually-an-old albums from a musician. This is an example of the mixture of previously released, re-released, at last, over-released best tracks with a sounds-like-regular album title. Let me tell you one thing. JP is dead and gone since Rob left the band. I doubt there will be more regular JP albums but you'll have plenty of compilations like this coming out until you stop buying."
5,Absolutely perfect,"It seems pointless to write yet another positive review of this book, but I feel compelled to add my voice. This is a surprising and completely charming book. This is the kind of picture book that reminds you that good children's literature should also be of some value to adults. This book reminds us that childhood is a magical and fleeting time. This is a book that all little girls should read. It is also a book to own and treasure and pass down for generations.""A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.""-- C.S. Lewis"
2,Not satisfied,"I bought this for my boyfriend who has a horrible cuticle biting habit. He said the stuff tasted nasty, and it probably would have done the trick if it didn't make his nails bright and shiny. He said there was no way he could attend client meetings with his nails painted, so he picked it all off and refused to let me apply it again."
1,Ineffective,"It's nothing more than clear nail polish, which I could have bought locally for a lot less and not had to pay shipping."
5,It Works,I was a little doubtful at first but my first use was as it said. After a few weeks I saw that my nails looked much healthier and my little nail biting habit was no more. I like it and highly recommended this for anyone that has a nail biting habit.
1,Does not have ANY bitter flavor.,"So I decided to try this after loosing a different product. I was disappointed to find that this product does not have ANY bitter flavor, or anything to dissuade you from biting your nails. This is a very thin product also and does not last long before washing/flaking off. I would not recommend this product."
1,Didn't taste bad,"I am trying to stop biting the skin around my finger nails. I rip them apart on a daily basis until I am bleeding. I got this to try to stop and it worked for the first day or so because I was afraid of tasting the stuff. Then I caught a finger in my mouth and... there wasn't much of a taste that bothered me. This did NOT work for me. I noticed on another review here someone mentioned some stuff called ""Mavala Stop"" and that apparently that worked for them. So I went to that and bought it. As I waited the few days for it to arrive I continued ripping my fingers apart as usual, then it arrived today. I put it on, and within about two hours caught myself licking my finger after eating something delicious. That stuff tastes NASTY!!!!!! I had to run and get orange juice to wash the horrid taste away. I definitely recomment Mavala Stop!!!!Mavala Stop, 0.3-Fluid Ounce"
1,Do Not Buy This!,"I ordered this for my eight year old daughter who bites her nails. This did not work at all! She said she couldn't taste anything and it didn't prevent her from biting her nails. This was a complete waste of money. The ""Mavala Stop"" product worked much better. (A little too well--if she wasn't careful she would taste it when she ate food with her hands!)"
1,didn't work for us,"Well, I bought this product for my daughter who has been biting her nails pretty much since birth. She didn't even hesitate to continue biting her nails when I put this stuff on her."
1,Didn't work for me!,"As my title for this review states, IT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME! I am desperately trying to stop biting my finger nails, and this was the first product I tried. The product description (and statements from other people who liked this product) states that it works wonders and will turn you cold turkey in no time. It does not have a nasty taste or smell at all, and it comes off your nails easily after a days use. I tried a different product, ""Mavala Stop,"" and it is marvelous, for it does everything that this product doesn't. Mavala Stop is worth the extra three dollars you'll spent purchasing it, unlike the Bite Ender, which I want my six dollars back for."
1,Ineffective,My 6 years old picks this product like it was glue. Create a film around it that with a simple wash gets removed.Didn't work at all.
5,This product works,"My granddaughter has been biting her nails for years. I bought her the bite ender and she has not bitten her nails since. The only problem, is that I must still remind her to paint it on. It is working."
1,A Real Garbage,"A low budget movie with miserable acting, repeating ""generic"" songs.Certainly does not do justice to Shania Twain's musical quality.Don't waste your time & money.This DVD is a total garbage.Shania: A Life in Eight Albums"
1,Horrible movie,"Having been a Shania fan since 1993, and having visited the Shania Twain Centre in Timmins and having read the excellent biography by Robin Eggar, this movie just doesn't cut it. They didn't even make the effort to film the movie in her hometown. The movie is filled with stereotypes and does a very poor job of tranlating some of the events in the Eggar book to the small screen.If you are a fan of Shania Twain, save time and just read the biography, or better yet visit the Shania Twain Centre in her hometown where you can see history for yourself."
1,a complete disappointment,"telling the story of a celebrity's life is always a difficult task and this attempt failed big time. It's uninspired, lacks pace and the cast is completely wrong. For me - as a huge Shania fan - it was a massive disappointment."
2,cost prohibitive,too expensive. could have gone to target or walmart and gotten the same item - or one similar to it - for a much better price.
5,Jessica and Lila skip class to see soap star,"When Kent Kellerman,a Soap Star is filming at the Sweet Valley Mall,Jessica and Lila have an idea to play hooky from school.They miss 1 class,but they get caught.Elizabeth cuts class,too to tell Lila and Jessica that the Rumor of Ms.Langberg[The Gym teacher] of not being in class is false,She is is school. Elizabeth doesn't get caught. Lila and Jessica have detention,they have to wash chalkboards afterschool everyday. Elizabeth takes Jessica's place on the basketball court."
3,Playing hooky,"Jessica thinks it is so inconvenient that school must go on while a spunky tv star is visiting town.!So she does the only thing she can do,of course,sneaks out of school.Elizabeth is worried that Jess will get into trouble so she follows placing herself in trouble too!"
5,A perfect work shoe,"I am enomously pleased with this shoe. I am on my feet most of the work day and struggled to find something that was appropriately professional while not killing my feet at the same time. This was the answer. They are very comfey and take excellent care of my feet while not looking like an athletic shoe. While everyone's feet are different, I do think you will find these a worthy investment."
4,blend of eastern classical and western rock music,apart from the vocals every thing is the best u could ask for. its a beautiful blend of eastern musical instruments like tabla and dholki and western guitars and drums. music is soothing and u really want to listen to it again and again.Junnon certainly is the best rock band of southasia.
5,Great,Hi!This product was given as a gift. It was requested by a family member.It arrived in plenty of time for Christmas and was packaged very good.I was very satisfied.
4,Good service,Product received timely. Still can't understand why this item is not available in stores.My wife would be very unhappy if this not available someplace.
3,Norelco 6843XL Reflex Plus Men's Shaving System,"This is the 8th Norelco shaver I have owned and as in the past it shaves my beard quite easily. It shaves smoothly and closely. However, it doesn't hold a charge as long as my previous Norelco's did. I also miss the indicator light that signaled when the batteries were running low."
1,I Agree - This one is JUNK,This is the third Norelco shaver I have owned and the second rechargeable. My first rechargeable was wonderful. This one is junk. It barely turns fast enough to use when plugged in or immediately after a recharge. The charge only lasts one-two days where my old one would hold a charge for two weeks with daily use until it died of old age after about 12 years of use!Pass this one by no matter how cheap someone offers to sell it!
2,OK,"The norelco shaver was not all I expected, but is OK enough to keep. Shipping and handling speed was excellent. Thanks."
2,TYPICAL CHINA---CUTTING CORNERS,"This Norelco was a great razor on the drawing board. Then, Norelco sent the plans to China and must have told them to give them the best price they could on manufacturing. So what did China cut? One of the batteries. So, instead of 2.4 volts as it was designed for, it only has one, 1.2v battery. Just shaving will stop it completely. A complete piece of junk."
3,razor is slower than molasses,"It is been years since I have used an electric razor and upon trying this model for the first time, I was disappointed at the slowness of the heads. I thought the rpm would have been a little faster giving a faster shave."
2,Disappointing compared to my old one,"I've gotten used to Norelco making a superior product; I'd be using my 10 year old triple header to this day if the shaver guy hadn't talked me out of repairing it again. The motor is weak and sounds sickly. It works, just not as well as my old one."
4,Making an unpleasant chore a little easier,"This is a good medium priced shaver. It does a good job, is fast, and easy to clean. It is attractive, and fits the hand well. Not top of the line, but a good value. Nothing negative to report."
4,Good Bargain,"This is a very good electric razor. Good, close shaves. Long battery life. No bells nor whistles. Simple, light weight and quiet. The travel bag is too small to be of use, but I woulldn't use it anyway - no whiskers escape, so I can just carry it loose in my suitcase."
4,Works fine,"After reading many reviews of different products this one seemed like what I wanted.It shaves well enough for my puppy face (sensitive skin still after all these years of shaveing with blade and electric).The ability to use this ravor with and without cord is ideal for me and the price seems to beat other products in this range.I've no need of fancy cleaning and charging stations that require space and refills. It cleans easily with the brush.Overall, I am happy enough - see how long it lasts."
2,Cut Corners...Unbelievable,"This Norelco 6843XL is made in China. Norelco took a great razor design and components, then, must have told China to make it cheap. So what did China do to save money on manufacturing? It would be unbelievable, except that it's China. They took a perfectly wonderful 2.4v cord/cordless shaver and only put one 1.2v battery in it. This piece of junk now runs slow and boggs down on wiskers. If you own one of these and you hate it, write Norelco and demand a refund."
2,NORELCO 6843XL Reflex Plus Rechargeable Cord/Cordless Men's Shaving System,"Cheaply made plastic parts. Retainer ring that holds cutting heads in place does not secure properly on mounting pin and ""disassembles"" when brushing to clean. Battery needs re-charging far too often for efficient/effective shaver operation.Over designed, over priced and over rated."
5,This volume is WUNDERBAR!,"If you've read other Dream Dance Series reviews, you can find a couple of similarities among the reviewers: We're loyal fans of the series, and those who are first-timers, become loyal fans. It's so refreshing to buy the volumes, knowing that Dream Dance will deliver the best in progressive dance/techno/trance there is. All of the songs are great, with awesome beats and beautiful melodies. Not all the songs have lyrics, and the ones that do, are not repetitive - everything is timed perfectly. But the best thing about this album is that the songs, although most are mixed, are not 20 minutes long. I don't know about you, but I can't stand it when I go to a club and stay there for two hours and then realize, as I'm leaving, that I've only heard 3 songs the entire night. The average song on this album is about 3:40, multiply that by 30 and you've got some time to realize how great life really is."
2,Arrived broken,"When I took the cage out of the box, the green plastic part was broken so that there's a gaping hole several inches wide in one corner. I was too lazy to return it, so instead I just taped over the hole with mailing tape and it works fine. But I wasn't pleased that it arrived broken when I paid full price for it."
5,"Super Pet My First Home, Large",I bought this for 1 guinea pig. It is easy to clean and big enough to have a large igloo house and a bowl for the guinea pig.
5,Perfect,"Cage was larger then I expected and my rabbit ""Coconut"" really appreciated it. Awesome cage. I would purchase again if I needed one..."
5,petcage is awesome,"bought the large cage, easy clean up, top and side door, easy to put together, less than 5 minutes!"
2,OK but only just,"I don't necessarily recommend this cage, but not for quality problems. The cage itself is as to be expected. The problem lies in that it's far too small to give proper exercise room to any sort of guinea pig, ferret, or rabbit. Unless you intend to use it as a part-time cage part-time litter box, it's too small. If you intend to keep any of these animals in it full-time, you'll have an unhappy animal, plain and simple. There's not room for food, water, toys, hides, an animal, and still give them room to stretch and run about. If you want it for something smaller, say, a rat, consider a leveled, vertical cage instead. They like to climb."
4,Perfect for a new small pet!,"I searched all over for a cage for my son's pet lopp-ear rabbit. This was the best priced cage I could find. The cage was easy to set up and is big and roomy. All in all this is a great choice for an indoor cage. The only problem was there was a small piece of hook shaped wire that was stuck, and had been painted on to the door. This was easily removed but left a small area on one bar that was unpainted. I would suggest simply looking the cage over thoroughly before letting animal or kids near it."
5,Very good cage for the price,"I was very pleased with this small cage, for the money it is great value. We are using one to house some bantam chickens over winter, it is a great small home for them, the deep tray allows them to scratch a little without making a mess."
4,Pretty good,"The cage was mostly what it was advertised to be. The only problem was one of the hook was crushed so it could not open or connect to the part to set up the cage. I really really had to use many tools to get it to sort of fit together. Another strange thing though I'm not sure if it's just because of my rabbit, but he ate part of the tray. He really got to parts of it and I thought this wasn't supposed to happen. Overall though, it's been a good cage. It a nice size for my bunnies, came quickly, and is pretty sturdy. I especially enjoy the top opening and how the bars do not wear too much though he chews on them.Thank you."
3,They don't Appear to Last,"What I'm about to say may not be the best review, because I only get to use these cages after they are used.I've used these cages at the animal shelter, so I'm not sure if my opinion is totally objective. The tops of the cages don't hold together well. The latches don't work, meaning the doors don't stay shut. You end up having to be creative in keeping the cage top together. I have no way to know how old the cages are when they are donated. I can only tell you that when we have to purchase cages, this one is never on our list."
5,got a good deal on amazon vs. petstores,"I got this same cage on amazon for about$20 less than any petstore around here. that makes me very happy! I do use it for a ferret, but the ferret is hardly in it. I would not suggest this for a ferret if its enclosed in it all day...not enough room. its fine for a guinea pig though"
2,Not for Rabbits,"This is a nice cage, it is sturdy and the bottom is tall enough that bedding does not get everywhere. However, it is not large enough for any rabbit to live in, my bun keeps her litter pan in here and her food but she runs around the main room for the majority of the day because my schedule allows me to do most of my work in my apartment. If I had a job that I had to be out of the apartment for more than an hour or two at a time though, I would never get this cage. It would work for a guinea pig or hamster but NOT a rabbit because they need room to run and exercise and this does not cut it. I would give this five stars if I had a guinea pig but it should not be labeled as a rabbit cage, because I was mislead."
1,Will make rabbit an easy meal for cat....,"I bought this because it showed a deep dish and i have a rabbit and needed a way to keep it from using the bathroom outside the cage. However, the wire cage part just sits on top of the base, theres no way to actually connect it. I also have a cat so I'm worried that if the cage were to get knocked over my cat would have an easy meal. Going to poke holes in the base and wire it down..."
2,Not ideal for rabbits,"Guinea pigs are about the largest thing you can put in a cage this small, and only up to two. A rabbit or ferret will need to be let out almost 24/7 to be healthy."
2,"Messy, messy, messy!","I have been a rabbit owner for many years and I have also had these cages for many years. This cage is great to start with especially when the rabbit is small, but when they get older, clean up is a hassle. They learn to kick and dig bedding out of the cage, and pooping outside the corner of the cage as well although they had litter boxes and were well trained. I found myself cleaning the floor outside of the cage daily. It is also a hassle to take the wire top off the cage to actually clean it. Of course, rabbits will be rabbits in this case, but I had to find an alternate cage to minimize cleaning outside of the cage. :) When I first bought this cage, I did find it extremely easy to assemble, but when my rabbits got older, it wasn't tall enough for them to stretch their legs in, and my rabbits aren't very large."
1,DO NOT GET THIS FOR GUINEA PIGS!!!!!!!!!!!,Di not get this for guinea pigs it is tortcher! They need FOUR FEET for EACH guinea pig! Y&#363; can't afford a bigger cage? Give them away!
2,"Unremarkable, poorly organized and arranged","The Good:Covers both sweet and savory cheesecakes which is nice.Includes simple recipes for things like sauces.The Bad:The cheesecake photos aren't actually next to the recipe. The recipe for a mixed berry cheesecake has the photo for an apricot cheesecake opposite it.The measurements are listed by volume in both metric and standard and takes shortcuts. There's no reason to list ingredients like cream cheese by volume and the alternate units should be grams not milliliters. My book is now heavily annotated with measurements by mass.There's little general theory on how to construct a cheesecake. Each recipe has its own crust, filling and topping and more general theory would help one create new stuff. How about ""here are 10 different crusts you can do"".I'd stick with print outs from web pages. Paying to have this arrangement of recipes doesn't strike me as worth it."
5,125 Best Cheesecake Recipes,"I bake for a small cafe in Australia and I have used many recipes from this book with customers telling us how much they enjoy the cheesecakes. Although I am from Australia the ingredients and all easy to get and instructions very clear. I highly recommend this book.Linda, Victoria, Australia"
5,Delicious easy to make cheesecakes,"Before getting this book, I thought cheesecakes were really difficult to make. Now? I'm the cheesecake queen! This book contains a short section on cheesecake basics (bakeware, ingredients, tools, etc.). The recipes are easy to follow and have very few (if any) hard to find ingredients."
3,MORE than enough,This book is good but it seems to have way more recipes than needed. Most are too complicating or require too fancy of ingredients for the lay person.
1,Bought for super saver filler,"gift for wife, she never wears it. IT got it me to get free shipping so it may become a rag next time goodwill donations are going out the door."
3,Cheap but not very stylish,"This sweater seems to run very large and is quite boxy. The color is nice, and it is soft. A functional piece, but it's a little more old lady than soccer mom. Overall, for the $5 I paid, it's not a bad deal. I typically wear a 6, and am swimming in the medium I purchased, so I'd advise trying a size smaller than what you think you need."
2,Bad Sizing,"Not a great sweater. Looks better in the picture. The material isn't too cheap and thin but the sizing is terribly incorrect. Medium seems to be a ""Large"". It's very loose and long. If you're tall... or pregnant, this might work for you. Petite figures beware -- it will drape like a circus tent."
3,Comfortable Basic,"I bought this sweater about a month ago and it was what I expected; a comfortable, basic cotton sweater. The fit is larger than true to size (as indicated by the photograph on the manequin) but this sweater is the ""quick trip to the store"" sweater, not an elegant ""twin set"" sweater"
4,Sweater,"I liked this sweater, and bought another for a friend. It felt true to size, and I liked the quality of workmanship, as well as the quality of the fabric."
5,WH Jackson wrote in his diary everyday!,"William Henry Jackson was born in 1943 and lived until 1942. His life spanned the pony express to the railroad to the car...he was a good friend of Henry Ford, another Detroit resident, and he lived to see planes and other modern conveyances. He wrote in his diary every day and this made writing his autobiography easy at 90, when he also began doing watercolors from his photos. Many of his items can be seen at the museum in Scott's Bluff, Nebraska. He was at the battle of Gettysburg and was buried in Arlington Cometary. He ate bird nest's soup with the emperor of Japan, dog sledded across Siberia, and walked across Korea. Many of these exploits were written up in Harpers Magazine. After leaving the Hayden expedition as photographer he set up a portrait studio in Colorado. Many of his line drawings and photographs grace the pages of his autobiography."
5,cccp rules but not avalaible in canada...,"it's a cd i'm looking for since years. just try to find punk islam in canada, just for fun. for my part, i failed..."
1,Would be great if it stayed closed!,This case is ok as a last resort or until there are more choices for this phone. My husband has one and his phone is always falling out of this case. After a while the catch that holds the two sides closed stops latching. At the slightest movement your phone will be on the floor. This is pretty much a metal frame and offers no screen protection at all.
2,Not having Wi Fi is a significant flaw,"I have been using T5 for the last one month or so. I thought I should also express my disappointment with T5. When some one is spending $300 plus for a PDA, it is not just for writing your appointment. I had a suspicion even before buying T5 that it is not going to be as good as Dell Axim. I bought it anyway because one of the software that I use in my profession is available only in Palm OS. If someone is not constrained by PDA OS, Dell Axim are such superior product compare to T5! I don't know what Palm is thinking about not adding the Wi Fi. Even the processor of T5 is not up to the par with Axim. Bottomline do not buy T5 unless you have to because you need Palm OS."
1,Product Released too Soon,"I purchased a T5 hoping for a great new day in Palm's. I've owned Palm's since the first one. Part of my ""deal"" was that I received $100 discount if I signed up for a year with Audible.com. I took the deal. Then, upon trying to operate the Palm after installing Audible I found it impossible to sync without faulting out in one manner or another. Upon talking the 3rd time with Palm's tech support I discovered that they were not yet fully compatible with Audible! This truly was a product released for Christmas, but due out for Easter."
4,Useful for busy people,I have had two Palm T5. Is a good product. I do not like the quality (the design is nice) of the graffiti. After 2 months start some minor difficulties.
1,dreadful,I have had the T5 now for about a year. I am surprised that I put up with it for so long. It constantly freezes. The web program is buggy. Today I lost all my settings. In short what you read here is correct. This is a flawed product and should have never been released. Stay away from it.
3,Fatal Memory Error,Just got the T5 and downloaded a PalmOne patch to prevent crashing. Now it crashes after each hot sync and gives a fatal error message. On the PalmOne forums several people are having this problem with the T5. If you don't mind sticking a paperclip in the back of a $400 machine to reboot after hot syncing - it's a nice item. I certainly hope I am able to find a solution to the problem soon. As I am not a heavy hitter business person my contacts and need to sync are light but this might be a problem to somebody who has a greater need to exchange information
1,Not even thinking in BUYING this troublemaker PDA,"Since I bought it this T5, the only results obtained were troubles!. Also the technical support of Palm1 is very poor. I have try to send it back and still they send me useless solutions to my problem.I had Palm products in the past but this is the worst!I have an old Toshiba, PDA, and I think I will go back to it or buy a new Toshiba product, maybe the latestone."
2,"If you own a T3, this is a downgrade","Compared to the T3, this ""upgrade"" lacks:* metal casing* voice recorder* silent alarm* slider* cradle (extra $39.95)In addition, the new T5 does not come with Wi-Fi (an overdue spec for the T series).The updated OS 5.4 hardly justifies the upgrade (T3 comes with OS 5.2), as is the case with the flash memory spec (a keyring flash unit has twice the capacity and doesn't require you to haul around the USB cable).Most everyone agrees that this unit is really a TE2, and not an upgrade for the T3.At $399, this is the most overrated and overpriced Palm PDS in the market."
2,I'm very disappointed,I bought this T5 for my husband for Christmas. It's now only May and the battery is dead. Not rechargable dead. He can't use it at all. That's a lot of money to pay for something that only worked for five months. What do I do now? I'm not buying another one. I wouldn't waste my money. He did enjoy it quite a bit while it worked. He did have problems with it syncing. I suppose I'll have to pay to get it fixed with another internal battery. If the battery is going to be such poor quality perhapse they should make it something more replacable. Just a thought.
4,Great Upgrade from Palm V - as long as you get the free Wi-Fi card,"This is a great upgrade from a monochrome Palm. It's more ""computer like"" than previous generations. The screen is great, ability to play videos, audio and browse the web are nice additions. Web browsing isn't bad. You can do a quick check of your email or check out your local weather radar faster than you can log on to your PC!I got mine as a refurb with a free Wi-Fi card for less than $300 ([...]). If you had to pay full retail for the Palm and the Wi-Fi it would be about $500 and NOT worth it.Configuring the Wi-Fi was quite a pain. The T5 would hang when searching for an IP address. I solved the problem by assigning a static IP and deleting the Wi-Fi database file on the Palm."
4,Other Reviewers are too harsh!,"Even without picking up the product, people are ripping the Tungsten T5, and that's too bad. Perhaps they should have called it the Tungsten E2 or something, b/c it is more like the E series than the Prior T series. But either way, it's darn fast, Tons of built in memory, and the OS is fine as it is. True, it's not the one we've been waiting for, but hey, for the same price as the other T series handhelds at their introduction, this is a sleek beauty that is a high performer.The other reviewers should lighten up a little, and not give a product 1 star because they don't like a feature or two, or it's not on their wishlist."
1,Don't bother,"I ordered a T5 for the office on April 28. When it arrived, I plugged it in for the 3 hour charge time recommended in the documentation. When I checked later--no charge. So I check the output of the charger with a voltmeter and nothing. Palm agrees to send me another one. When it arrives several days later it's an international adapter. Great---now I have an excuse to go back to Jamaica. Another call prompts them to send another one but a check this morning shows it not scheduled to ship until this Wednesday. The request was placed this past Friday. By the time I get the new part, I will have had this thing for two weeks and been unable to use it."
3,Great when it works,"This is a really nice handheld, but the OS is EXTREMELY BUGGY. Think Windows ME buggy. If you buy this handheld, you must immediately buy Backupbuddy Pro. Other backup programs don't work on this model. Why do you need Backupbuddy? Because at least once a day you will get a Fatal Exception or a Fatal Alert. Every other time this happens, on average, you will lose all of your saved preferences (the file actually becomes corrupted). Then, of course, all of your software becomes unregistered. This means you either have to hard reset and sync to get your preferences back, or restore from Backupbuddy (I just finished doing this as I write this). The nice thing with backupbuddy is that you have to option, unlike a hard reset, of not restoring your calendar, contacts, etc., so if you had entered some new appointments right before the crash, you won't lose those either.This is actually a 5 star performer, but the crashes really take away your confidence in the machine."
3,good pda.......... but a disappointment...,"I purchased the T5 for $450 including original PALMONE leather case when it was released on the market on 2005. everything was Ok and exactly as they said except for some frequent fatal errors that you have no choice but to reset, etc. etc. I've encountered them a few months after. The casing itself is cheap it got easily scratched with its OWN removable front cover AND leather case!! Now, it made a permanent mark on the faceplate. The Power button is probably picked up from some garbage dump near their factory and they managed to assemble it with the Four-hundred Dollar PDA... I hate it! You have to press really deep to just turn it on/off and a couple of times it doesn't turn on/off! Other than that, its pretty fast and the screen is excellent bright and large enough compared to other PDAs"
1,"Beware, this is the worst Palm so far...","I received the Tungsten T5 Palm as a gift from my wife in September. Although I admit that the features advertised sound very nice, and that the graphics and media are cool, I have not been able to enjoy them, as the Palm has crashed almost every day, and there have been at least two periods in which I have not been able to turn it on for over one week! I have called ""Palm Support Service"", and the agree that they have experienced that problem with other customers, and they have tried to correct it, but so far I'm still experiencing this problem. Perhaps this handheld could be good, but since it barely works, my advice is to stay far away from it!"
2,PALMONE: WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO US!!,"I have been a loyal PALM customer since the PALM III, most of the time upgrading when the new ones would come out. The T3 is probably one of the best handhelds I had, so I was estatic at the news of the T5 coming out. Like someone below me said: big disapointment! It really is an improvement based on the E models, it should be call E2 or something arround those lines.I do have now the TREO 600 and plan to upgrade to the 650.Three more companies this week joined SONY's strategy to abandon the handheld market and begin concentrating on smartphones...sounds right to me.I would not recommend this item. Get instead the T3 or upgrade to a smartphone."
1,Utter Garbage,"I recently went from an iPaq to the T5, recalling fondly how much more stable the OS was on my older Vx compared to Windows CE. How things have changed. The reset pin has turned out to be the most valuable accessory provided, and it gets a regular workout. No Wi-Fi? Really? Whose enlightened decision was that? This is a classic example of a product designed in a vaccuum, with little or no regard for the needs and expectations of the customers who keep palmOne in business. I live overseas and the tech support one gets from Singapore is, while courteous, wholly ineffective. I have been walked through unnecessary processes that border on comedy, and find myself running a mini-tutorial for them (on my dime) each time I call. The T5 is a paperweight. It will mean nothing to them, but palm has lost another customer."
4,Tungsten T5 WOW,well I love this product. love its memory capacity. love its ease in transferring of information from pc to handheld. love its flash drive capability... no more lost data cause the battery ran out! my deal was awesome I got a hard case with free rebate and a free keyboard. I am very happy. I had only one soft reset to handle a problem with my beam. its pricey but the best out there in my view. note* i purchased an additional warranty for workmanship and technical difficulites. i havent had to use it for workmanship but have made some calls to the technical dept all free and all matters thoroughly handled.
3,Looked nice but was returned,"I got this as a gift for my husband.It looked nice but he told me it didn't have feature he was looking for, and we returned it."
3,Palm Tungsten T5,"I bought this item as a christmas gift for my husband but he didn't like the features since it could not be connected to wifi. I had to send it back for a refund and when I wrote to Gamzi Digital, they responded very positively in a very short time even though the purchase date was well passed the return policy timeline. Once I mailed the item back to Gamzi, they processed my refund immediately via Amazon and within 3 days, the money was credited back to my bank account. This was such a relief given the fact that I had never dealt with this supplier before. Amazon is definitely a trusted company to work with and I also wish to thank Mr Israel, CEO of Gamzi Digital for his positive and prompt attention to my situation."
4,It is a great CD that as soon as I saw it I wanted to own it,"I really liked it, I listened to it at the radio station and I wanted to have it. I copied it and I wore out my tape so I ordered it off of the internet."
4,i liked it,"easy to assembly, are grandson loved it. we would be willing to buy a few more for our other grandkids"
2,Nothing fit correctly...,"I bought these as a simple project for my grand daughters thinking how enjoyable it would be to watch them put them together. They were excited to get started but as soon as they started... they had to stop. After following the directions... lining up the front and back walls to the holes in the floor piece and gluing them in place, the side wall pieces were 3/8"" too long to fit. They went from being excited and having fun to being bored while I spent the time trimming the side wall pieces to fit."
4,Cool,This is a good small project with kids. My 4 year old son and I built and painted this in about 30 minutes. Really simple to put together and the included paint works great.
4,"Lots of fun, good value",Our daughter REALLY wanted to build a birdhouse. This kit was really easy to put together and we painted it and hung it in our tree. We've had it up for months and it is holding up really well. Just waiting for a bird family to move in.
4,Lots of Fun for the Kids,"This was a ton of fun to build with my daughters. The one thing I didn't do is test the paint for lead after we painted it. After all, it was made in China and you have to wonder about such bright colored paints. If anyone has a lead testing kit, it would make some sense to check the paint."
4,Great father/daughter project,"My husband bought this for our daughter for her 4th birthday. She was ecstatic to try to build it and paint it. As other reviews stated its VERY small, but she loves it non the less. We will be hanging it outside come spring. Definitively worth the price."
1,all parts not included,"I had to go buy hooks to complete the project. I shop online to avoid such hassles, so I am very unhappy about my experience."
2,I'm being generous giving it 2 stars...,"I bought 2 of these kits for my kids that wanted to build bird houses. I would not recommend this product to anyone. The pieces fit very poorly and some of the wood was warped (both kits). I really should have taken some pictures before I threw them away. 1 of the kits was missing a couple nails, the other kit was missing one of the hooks for the chain. The kits are also REALLY small when put together, so if you are expecting birds to live in it I hope you have really small birds where you live.I wound up going to a local craft store and picking out a better, larger kit for the same price."
3,My 3 year old daughter and I built it. She liked painting it the most.,"Easy to build. Comes with just enough paint to do a good job. Unfortunately no birds have moved in yet. It is rather small. Oh well, it looks nice and we had fun building it."
3,"Fun, but potentially frustrating","Hooks were missing, and one piece of wood was too large to fit. Had we not had a saw, sandpaper, and some spare nails, the project would have ended quickly with one frustrated 4-year-old. However, we were able to compensate for what the kit lacked, and had a good time."
3,Incorrect Instructions,"This is a cute bird house assembly project suitable for young children aged 4-7 years, although they will need an adult to assist with the actual assembly (wood glue and nailing are required). I found a few of the assembly directions to be incorrect. However, the overall configuration of the pieces, along with the finished picture on the box, provides sufficient information to put this bird house together."
4,Great activity for kids,"Purchased kits for my son's cub scout requirement. Instructions areA bit off, but easy and fun for 7-8 year olds. Make sure an adult is there to readInstructions."
3,Not bad for the price,"I bought 3 for our cub scout group, ages 8. It was fairly easy to put together, but the instructions could have been a bit easier and needed an adult to explain to the boys on how to do it. With a little adult help, the boys were able to put together the birdhouse and had a lot of fun just hammering things together. We did not have time to color the birdhouse and send the paint home with them."
4,fun gift,We received it as a gift and enjoyed it a lot putting it together and painting it. We've given it as a present a few times since. It's lovely.
3,a pox on you,"While this isn't typical of the earlier work fans of Sonic Boom's laid back, dreamy, phasey wash of guitars style, this is still a fine piece of work. Collaborating with indie stars Jessamine, Sonic manages to expand upon the dreamy sounds of yesterday with a foray into an almost american rock sound, but still with the trademark two chord progression. Hyper, yet restrained, this e.p. feels like it's about to burst out of your cd player but never does. Overall I found it dissapointing but then I'm a bigger fan of his earlier masterpiece, Soul Kiss (Glide Divine) which always leaves me knocked out lying on the floor with a big roach in the ashtray."
4,Latin for dabblers,"I know zip about Latin music. However, I do know soul, and this is plenty soulful. If you were weaned on rock 'n' roll or R&B and think you'd like to try Latin music, this is a possible entry point. It will not sound alien to your ears, yet will have enough exoticism to keep you listening past your normal attention span. All the artists play and sing their butts off, and who couldn't use a little more ""Good Lovin'""? Highly recommended."
5,Most comfortable fit ever,"I already had one of these that I picked up somewhere, but couldn't find in the stores now. It's so difficult to find a nice, natural shape anymore.This looks great and, better yet, is Very comfortable. So I bought 3.I can always count on Amazon to have hard-to-find items."
1,Major disappointment!,"My son wanted this item so badly for Christmas and I finally broke down and got it. Nothing works on it! The base isn't working (with the required 14 or so batteries), one of the Rangers doesn't fit in properly, and the LED light stays on one of the transmitters even in the ""off"" position. Great concept, terribly made, waste of money. Will be returning it tomorrow."
1,Waste of money - agreed.,"My son also wanted this and I wasn't going to go for it but he told Santa it was the thing he most wanted. Pieces were missing, the figures did not fit well into the base and one of the figures was defective - wouldn't kick. Very cumbersome with wires hanging off your children. Returned and did not replace."
4,The disco era is still alive,"The First Choice is one of the most famous disco groups from the 70's. Most of their succesfull songs are composed, arranged by the well known three letters ""BHY"", which means Baker, Harris and Young. These three letters means, without any doubt a top dance hit. Also, the final mix was done by Tom Moulton, which is also a guarantee of a top dance hit. All songs are among the First Choice most known, but in this compilations they missed some important songs such as ""Guess what Mary Jones did?"" and ""First Choice Theme""."
4,First Choice....come back again,"God, where do I start? First Choice was/is a first class act. Under the aegis of BHY, Baker Harris Young, these trackes are fully the ultimate of classic disco/dance. Mind you disco is not a dirty word! The DANCE music of today owes a hell of a lot to these classics. Just listen to the medley from the Hold Your Horses LP...smooth classic Philly sound..Oh I could go on and on, but I need to slip this disc onto my player...I do recommed this CD"
5,first choice is top choice,this two set cd is great it has all there classics regular and twelve inch mixes plus some good liner notes.
2,Not my cup of tea,"I don't know... Maybe it's just me... But I find her rubatos very heavy, and a bit ""over the top"". It's like the way that you were first tempted, as a child, to play Chopin. But if you were lucky, your piano teacher discouraged it. And apparently someone forgot to tell Okashiro that these are Etudes and NOT Nocturnes. Her tempos are almost uniformly too slow. However, the sound quality of this CD is excellent. The best recording of the complete Scriabin Etudes, in my opinion, is the Piers Lane CD."
1,THIS SCRIABIN CD MISSES THE POINT,"It is not enough for a pianist to simply produce beautiful sounds and beautiful rubato in order to play Scriabin effectively. Chitose Okashiro possesses the above-mentioned qualities - a fine tone and sense of color -but in Scriabin, the music must always serve the composer's vision, that is, the pianist must be completely at one with this composer's idiomatic style. Chitose Oshakiro doesn't seem to absorb that particularly feverish and strangely poetic atmosphere specific to Scriabin's sound world. It is not apparent that she has absorbed any of Scriabin's writings or recordings, but seems rather to follow a vaguely manneristic style of execution.In other words, there is a lack of imaginative effort and deep identification with the composer's aesthetics and spiritual world. And to think of all the people who are going to think that this recording is what Scriabin is all about..."
2,Don't be fooled!,"I am extremely upset with buying this CD. I saw several review for this CD at various places, had a gift certificate I needed to use before expiry, and figured, why not. I 'love' Sash, and I especially love Ecuador. Various reviews said this was like equador, or just as good, or something like that. This does 'not' compare. If this was playing on the radio, I'd change stations, if it was playing at a club ( it never would be, trust me ) i'd get off the dance floor. This is 'NOT' a hidden gem of a cd, few people know about this cd or track for a reason, IT STINKS!."
5,Say Yes!,"This is only part I! The Whispers had a way with silky smoothness that would melt a block of ice! These jams are both sensuous and sexy!Classic, classic, mellow smooth slow jams from ""Love is Where you Find it""...to ""Living Together in Sin!"" This is a must have for any smooth grooves collector!"
3,Worked while it lasted,I put this on Odin my fourteen month old husky/ lab mix.hes at least 100 lbs and so am I.lol so walking him was a pain.I used this and it was literally like walking a different dog.unfortunately it only lasted 3 walks..I had tied him to the porch to go grab us some water and by the time I came out he has broken one of the shoulder straps.:( also it sucked putting it on him.
5,LOVE this harness,"I originally purchased one of these Sporn harnesses about 10 years ago for my German Shorthaired Pointer and only got rid of it when she passed away after 8 years of daily use. When we got our next dog (Shepherd/Chow mix), I purchased the Premier Easy Walker for her, and it did not perform well for me. My dog could still knock me off my feet if she took off running and she slipped out of it several times. I saw this Sporn harness on Amazon when looking for a retractable leash and added it to my order. I walk my dog multiple times each day, and it has really slowed her down. She does not even go as far as the leash allows and has not taken off running on me. It really makes walking her in the wooded areas with little critters that get her attention so much easier. I will never buy a different brand of harness again."
5,"Great product, highly recommended","My 2 1/2 year old black lab was always pulling on her leash no matter what I did to try to train her not to. Finally I read about this halter and tried it - perfect, immediately no more pulling! It goes around her body, not her neck and the straps are very soft under her legs. Takes just a few seconds to put on her.There are very few small things that are life changing but this halter is one of them."
5,Awesome!,"My BIG Malinois (over 100 pounds) is a sweetheart, but far too strong for me. I hate the choker collar I had been using (which did not stop his pulling.) A friend told me about this. My dog NO LONGER PULLS and is quite happy (and so am I). My ONLY complaint is that the listing does not give me a way to determine the correct size. I had to go to another website to get this information. I ordered a large and it is perfect!"
3,good product but not for strong pullers,"Got this for my year and 9 months old 60 lbs pitbull mix who would pull even with a spike choker. I was hoping that this harness would stop him from pulling, but no success. He also seemed to be bothered by all the restraint although it did not stop the pulling. Perhaps this would be a good product for tamer and less energetic dogs."
4,Huge difference!,I received this today and put it on my super hyperactive pitbull...it was amazing. We went through squirrel hades where she normally walks on her back legs while choking herself the entire time wanting to chase--she stayed on all four paws and I was able to hold her back. Normally we would have a dragging contest. I pull one way she drags the other while she wheezes and gasps trying to get a snack. The only drawback I can see is the material is very thin. She caught the back strap in her teeth one time and nearly bit through it. Thankfully I was able to knot it below where she chomped and its still perfectly usable. She behaved like a different animal--now I am looking forward to our nightly 2 mile walks. I'd be a bit leary using it on a 100 lb dog since the straps are so thin but it works perfectly for my 45 lb dog.
1,Very Cheap Construction,"I bought this for my Rottweiler mix who goes crazy after squirrels. It fit her very well but both front rings broke as soon as we walked out the door! Instantly. We just turned around, put her regular DreamWalker harness on and threw what was left of the Sporn Halter away."
5,vintersorg rules,"easily one the best singers out today. I like the way his album is very diverse yet consistent. He had a wonderful voice and a black metal voice, he can switch back and forth very easily and it sounds great. The songs are epic sounding and very solid. I suggest you also check out borknagar's latest release called empiricism. It freatures ol vintersorg on vocals, he is their new singer."
3,"tales of time,space and humanity","there's nine short stories in this book,some are really great and some a little boring. I liked espacially the following ones:""the maze"" , ""the reluctant heroes"",""the wreck of the ship john b."" & ""a life in the day of"". between the stories there are comments written also by frank robinson relating the stories - what made him write them and what they are about,it's been interesting to read them before reading each story and again after reading the story.my rate (3 stars) is a kind of an avarage ,for the first story - ""the maze"" i would give 5 stars !"
2,Nice idea - could be better quality,"Unit seems to operate ok except that the clamps don't fit into the tight space around the battery posts in my car. I have an older Schumacher charger with much smaller clamps that fit everywhere...these folks could learn from that.Also, the instruction manual seems like it was originally written in some other language and translated into English. It's spotty in details and I seem to get items on the unit's display that aren't at all documented in the manual."
1,"Horribly built, DON'T BUY!","This piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it's dead, and it's really easy to charge and use. Problem is, after I had used it a couple times, the cheapo plastic clamps BOTH SNAPPED. Now they can't grip on the battery terminals. Under warranty, but so expensive to ship (shipping not covered by warranty) that it isn't worth it. Great idea, shoddy construction. ALL VECTOR have these same plastic clamps, so try to find one with metal clamps."
4,Another great in the UL series,"I think I have over twenty of these in my collection, you can't go wrong if you're into this genre with the UL collection. Some better than others but so far not a bad one in the bunch."
3,So-So Sounds from the Silver Screen,"Here is a fairly good addition to the ULTRA-LOUNGE series. There are some hidden gems, such as ""You Gotta Taste All the Fruit"" and a swingin' organ version of ""You Only Live Twice,"" but there are also quite a few forgettable tracks."
4,Fun Party Music,Everytime I play this CD at a party it gets people laughing and discussing this great music. It's perfect with any crowd. The entire series is a blast.
1,A missing piece of key information for 9 pin...,"They don't tell you in the description, but they tell you in the instruction sheet:If you're trying to reset a 9 pin chip that has fallen below 25%, it is ""permanently locked dead""...making this item useless."
1,Does not work with Epson 69 ink,"I have an Epson WorkForce 610. The ink (69) has 5 prongs on one line, and 4 on the other. This chip resetter has 4 prongs on one line, and 3 on the other. Perhaps this is why it can't reset my ink. I get the red flashing light - but it never has turned green, and my printer still complains that the cartridge is empty. I'll have to keep looking..."
1,Chip re-setter is a waste of $$$,"I purchased this Epson chip re-setter hoping to save money$$$ on ink cartridge costs but ended up wasting $$$ because the darn thing DIDN'T work! First, you have to re-set the ink cartridge BEFORE your computer let's you know that it's almost empty otherwise it won't work. So I tried to re-set a fairly full cartridge (1/4 of the way empty) but it still didn't re-set it. In fact, after trying to re-set the fairly full cartridge the Epson printer would no longer read/accept the cartridge so I ended up having to put ANOTHER new cartridge in to the printer in order to print. A BIG waste of time and $$$$!"
1,No funcionó / Didn't work at all,I tried in all the cartridges I had for Epson T22 and it did not work at all.SPANISHLo probé en varios cartuchos de todos los colores para la Epson T22 y no funcionó en ninguno.
2,didn't work,I have an Epson NX415 and an Epson NX200 printer and the resetter did not work for me. I tried using the resetter on cartridges from both printers to no avail. Not worth the money to return.
1,Don't Purchase This Product!,"Two things occurred when I received my chip re-setter: first it fell apart and it failed to re-set my ink cartridge. Better off skipping this product and continue your search for a more reliable product, but also something that can last longer than 2 minutes of use. I never had any bad experience with Amazon until I received this TERRIBLE product."
1,Piece of crap-don't waste your money.,Doesn't work at all. I have an Epson WF25-40. This thing sucks. Total waste of money. It didn't work on my cartridges. I tried everything.
5,Save SO Much Money On Epson Ink,This product works exactly as advertised. Tired of throwing away all those Epson ink cartridges when you can still hear a ton of ink left when you shake them? Use this device. It works. You will be able to use your cartridges to the last pico-drop.
4,A different sound,"I loved the Doublehearted album by D' Sound. For this new album, I think that their sound evolved so much. This album has a groovy lounge and jazzy music feel to it. The melodies are not as catchy as some of their previous songs but maybe they did it on purpose to deviate from the pop genre. This album would probably fall under easy listening. The instruments and production of the album are pretty good. Their new sound is not entirely my cup of tea but enjoyable nonetheless."
3,Slow buildup to a good last 100 pages,"""Banker"" is narrated by Tim Ekaterin, a young merchang banker who, after approving a 5 million loan to a horsebreeder to buy a stallion, discovers just how dangerous the world of horsebreeding can be.This was the first Dick Francis book I read and although I'm not very interested in horses, racing or horsebreeding, his knowledge made the subject interesting and I liked the story. The main problem with the novel is that it takes way too long to get started. It starts out okay but halfway into the book I started to get bored by descriptions of too many irrelevant details. The it improved again and the last 100 pages were very good. In all it was a decent but uneven novel that would have benefited from tighter plotting in the first 150 pages."
5,Biology,I saved a lot of money buying an older edition of this book and it's the same content. Certain subjects don't really change. So for me it works. Thanks!
2,Popular Metal Mediocrity,"There are few redeming qualities to this album. Silly electronic noises bombard the background accompanied by drums and bass which often sound weak and machine generated. The musicianship is mediocore at best, the tracks produced and polished, the composition downright infantile. In a word, this album is ""fluf."""
3,"Good music, bad recording","I really enjoy Royal Hunt's music. Paradox is one of my all-time favorite CDs, so I was quite looking forward to hearing ""The Mission."" Even though this album is very well written and performed (John West has never sounded better), the recording, mixing and mastering is amateurish, at best. Honestly speaking, I have better sounding four-track demos at home. I was tempted to give this CD no more than 2 stars but, in spite of the poor recording, I still enjoy the songs. Only for the true fan..."
5,Best children's nursery rhyme and fairy tale book ever made.,This is the best nursery rhyme and fairy tale book ever compiled. All the stories are pre Disney and I have never seen a modern book best it.
5,An Interesting book on the history of the American Indian race,"Dolores Cannon has been doing past life regressions with patients for decades on the origin of their physical, health and relationship problems. Here she regresses a patient who remembers, while in trance, being an alien from another star system whose ship landed in Alaska thousands of years, ago, with other members of his ship who crashed. In the beginning, these humanoids had problems adjusting to solar rays (as they had pale blue skin and not the pigmentation of the human race which protects us from the sun) and the severe temperatures in Alaska. Some of the crew members died, but many survived and eventually intermarry with Alaskan Indians. Many of these descendants, today, have problems with skin cancers which go back thousands of years to their alien ancestors. A fascinating book!! Barbara Fifield"
3,Starcrash people and remnants,"It is hard to believe everything you read, despite the intentions and truthful beliefs the writer portrays or relays...could we be stemmed from a very ancient culture. is culture even the world. A race like, yet unlike our modern-day modern humans...only to find out in the past we were surrounded by intelligent and speaking animals of the forest, energy, consciousness and powers we cannot even begin to understand. it is labeled as New Age or non=fiction...very informative and intellectual to a degree...feels like I am on the psychiatric table accounting a view or series of visions I am beginning to uncover myself...very cool but takes a while to step back and analyze from different reference points...anything can point to truth, but where do we start to research it? many mysteries are waiting to be unearthed -- pardon the pun."
5,An Alien experience,"Mrs. Cannon always writes interesting books. If someone were a fiction writer, I can't imagine creating the stories she writes. Mark Twain wrote ""Truth is stranger than fiction, because fiction has to be plausible"". I love her books."
4,Not one of my favorites,"I really love reading Dolores' books, but this was not one of my favorites. There are a few very interesting parts but most of it was anti-climactic. Nevertheless, it was still a fun read and as always Dolores' work captures my imagination like no other can."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Could not watch this DVD , no matter how I adjusted the tv. The quality was so poor. Most of it was too light, then sections were so dark you could see nothing at all. The sound was also off in many parts. Why do companies release stuff that is in such poor condition?"
1,Paradise in Harlem,"Not what I expected!!!I am a huge Pigmeat Markham fan. This was not the movie I was looking for, big disappointment."
2,Paradise in Harlem,I was disappointed with the story line and the leading man's character. Maybe it was the mentality of the times.
3,HISTORY,I collect these. Every now and again I find an exceptional one. This one was fair. Not a waste of time.
5,Nothing like the 70's,"I was taken back by a song I heard on TV. When I went looking for this particular band and more specifically the song, I ran into what became no luck at all. No one had it. As it turned out, I had luck with Amazon on another hard to find purchase some time ago. Amazon came through then as it did this time.Thanks again,Scott"
1,Booooring!,"I am very disappointed! One-dimensional, simple, boring. Mitch Rapp is a superagent, a national hero - good. But I don't wanna read this every single page. First of all I missed action and suspense. Instead I got a lot of propaganda against liberals and leftists. I mean, he is (mostly) right. But I expected a espionage thriller, not a collection of phrases."
5,Thought provoking; CIA versus terrorists.,"I wanted the terrorists caught right away, but then there wouldn't be a story! Great read. Was so glad there were 2 books to read that connected."
5,intro to Vince Flynn,My husb worked for the FBI and it was as if The author was looking over the shoulder of the Justice dept. I hadnt read or heard of Flynn before and now hes one of my favs. carol
5,"Timely and ""politically incorect""","Vince Flynn and his hero, Mitch Rapp's action-packed fight against terrorism is not only hard to put down, but very timely. AND, his contempt for politicans and his unrelenting pursiut of justice is adictive!!!!"
4,Rapp's a married man,"Vince Flynn now has to deal with the problem other authors have run into as they try and develop their characters...Mitch Rapp is married. Having a spouse can change the character. You can see it some in ""Executive Power"" but so far, Flynn is managing it.What I think he might have more trouble with is keeping Rapp from the action. Rapp is best when he's in the thick of things so if he takes a step back, it might hurt the character.All in all, I enjoyed the book. However, the hostage rescue storyline seemed a bit gratuitous, a way to keep Rapp in the story while the main story was being set up.The premise of ""Can Middle East peace be achieved through war"" is an interesting idea explored in this novel and once Rapp turns his attention to the novel's main story, it raced quickly to a great end.Enjoy it. I did."
4,Get rid of the wife,"I love Flynn's books, but this one was not one of his best. I thought the history and politics of Israel and Palestine was very interesting. There were actually two story lines in this book. The Palestinian plot by David against the Saudi millionaire misfit who sponsored David's terrorism and then the kidnapped family in the Philippines. Rapp is directly involved in saving the family and it was a bit far-fetched. Rapp's new wife is a pain. She is a reporter who is only interested in getting a story and not about keeping her mouth shut regarding Rapp's covert activities. This book cannot compare to Memorial Day."
3,enjoyable wallpaper,"Pretty forgettable read for me. I think based on other reviews I shouldn't give up on Flynn since this sounds to be one of his weaker efforts, but I seriously have trouble even remembering the storyline, it seemed so generic. Lots of middle east/Israeli intrigue, but so over the top that it lost plausibility for me. I will say it was enough of a page-turner that I finished it, but it definitely didn't leave me wanting more. I'd advise starting with one of his other books, if like me this is your first Flynn."
3,A page-turning novel of international intrigue.,"Vince Flynn does an excellent job of holding interest in this novel cast around the formidable but likable protagonist, Mitch Rapp. Rapp's rough character, sharp mind, and thirst for action round out his well-written interactions with frustrating bureaucrats and his tender, but tough, wife. Highlights of the novel include the insider looks into the minds of assassins, the complex and interwoven politics of America and the Middle East (and the Philippines), and the drama of the oval office in tense situations. A couple of editorial errors and a few weaker dialogue points brought its star rating down for me, but it was overall a captivating read."
1,No Comparison to Flynn's Earlier Novels,"I totally enjoyed Flynn's earlier novels. Couldn't put them down until finished. This book, however, was a huge disappointment. I found myself skimming pages to get through the plot. Rapp's character development has apparently been stunted, and Anna was nothing more than one-dimentional and completely annoying. The plot contained too much news and history intertwined with what little action was included. I'm still a Flynn fan; I just chalk this up to a need to fulfill a publishing contract since this novel does not resemble his earlier novels."
4,"Good airplane read - fast, held my interest","I've been anticipating Vince Flynn's latest book for months and couldn't wait to read it. While I enjoyed the book, I was frustrated with the two separate stories that didn't seem to have any relevance to each other beyond the character's involvement. It was almost like two short stories tied together with Mitch Rapp. In addition, both stories should have been prefaced with ""Ripped from the headlines!"", as they borrowed heavily from recent world events.As much as I love Vince Flynn's writing and the counter-terrorism storylines, I didn't feel this was his best book. I would recommend any of his first three books over this one in a heart beat."
3,Boring,"I've been systematically reading all of the Rapp series (I started with American Assassin, then worked my way from the beginning on through -- and yes, AA was the best thus far). This particular book, while mildly entertaining, did not hold my attention like many of his previous novels. I feel like this was more of a history lesson and a collection of several unrelated story lines rather than a cohesive book.And I am tired of Anna.She is a royal pain in my ass. Yeah, I understand that having a love-interest is probably good for sales, but this guy is a trained killer, yet he allows this one pushy woman (albeit, good in bed) to control his thinking and his emotions. Enough of her. I am not reading Flynn for love stories.I am hoping that the rest of his works improve, else I am tempted to move on without completing the series."
3,"Rapp is getting tired,.","""Seperation of Power"" was a tough act to follow, and ""Executive Power"" falters under the weight. Flynn's writing is still top notch, and the plot exciting enough that I pushed through to the end and found it at least satisfying. The problem I think is that Mitch Rapp is tired, he doesn't seem to have the same pop of his earlier adventures.Since the plot concerns events and issues, and take place in the most violent part of the contemporary world, that is on everyone's mind is what saves this adventure. But I think it is now time for Flynn to retire Rapp, at least for a while, and bring us a new hero next time out."
3,Good but lacking...,"This book is entertaining and fast-paced; however, I do agree that the two plots in the story are completely unrelated and throws the reader back. I think the hostage plot was an attempt to fill space and to build Rapp into a more of a macho hero. Of the two plots, neither is fully developed. The Palestinian/Israeli conflict is more interesting. David's character is fascinating and an equal match for Rapp. I was expecting the climax to be some kind of David/Rapp faceoff, which never happened. This was a disappointment. The ending was a cheap shot, it's as if Flynn didn't know how to end the book. At the end the reader feels manipulated.I love the Mitch Rapp character but in this book, he is at times, too over the top. He makes everyone seems moronic. And what is that fear he has of his wife?The book does a good job in portraying two sides of the coins in issues. Overall it was exciting and a page turner. I liked Memorial Day better."
3,Entertaining but not up to par for Flynn,"I loved all of Flynn's other books but ""Executive Power"" was my least favorite. Not much new here except for the melodramatic relationship between Rapp and his new wife Anna. My opinion is that part of the story could have been dropped. It made me cringe and skip pages something I didn't do in his other books.I would recommend Dan Brown's ""DaVinci Code"" and his ""Angels and Demons"" as more intriguing and exciting read."
2,Like reading the newspaper,"I don't know if Flynn has slipped into writing like a newspaper prints but I found this story(ies) slightly exasperating for half of the book. Skipping from plot to plot each chapter. Was there a point? Still too much killing! He still continues to be redundant with his history of each character which I find annoying. Coloring each character with each new novel is a waste as is the blank pages and multiple blank spaces on the short chapters!The plot(s) weren't as good as in his previous books and leaves out enough reality to make me wonder if he should write comics!Rapp, Rambo or Gump? Hmmmm... I think I'll chose Forrest over the others to save this world singlehandedly!"
1,This book was not purchased by me,Please corrct your records. I purchased Transfer of Power on 24 April 2012 Not Executive Power on 4 April 2012
1,Was not Hardcover,"Shipped on time. Ordered a hardcover book. Rec'd soft covered book. Book was the size of a hardcover book, but not hardcover. Did not return book, just never buy from them again."
3,an enjoying read -- just don't question. :),"a surprisingly good effort from flynn (All Is Relative, of course). he still can't correctly use semi-colons to save his life (to him, they're synonymous with commas), and sometimes it's painfully obvious when he rediscovers a ""big"" word: ""vaunted"" will appear twice in two pages and then never reappear in the book. but mitch rapp and irene kennedy are always good for a thriller, and add a mitch-like palestinian assassin named david/jabril, some corrupt members of the house of saud, an abu sayyaf hostage situation in the phillipines, and you've got a good yarn going. unlike flynn's previous efforts, this novel didn't flag and fold before the denouement. flynn seems to be improving??"
5,Page Turner,"I love the Mitch Rapp character. And this one did not disappoint. The pages flew by. Before I knew it, I needed another book to read!"
4,Not Flynn's Best,While this book is good--it is not as good as Flynn's previous books. Does give good background on the Middle East and Special Forces. Vince Flynn does know how to write a political thriller.
2,Unwrapping Rapp,"Sub-par story as author Vince Flynn, obviously trying to keep up with fast changing events in the Middle East, spends far too much time explaining the ongoing political struggle between Israel and Palestine and too little time with the hero, Mitch Rapp. Also, having Rapp domesticated and reassigned to a bureaucratic environment subtracts greatly from his far more interesting freelance, loner-assassin role in earlier books."
4,CIA Anti-Terrorist Advisor Mitch Rapp Has More Adventures,"The reader is confronted with a rather wimpy Democrat President who had the good sense to bring in as an Advisor Mitch Rapp, a real all-star hero. The book starts off with an ill fated attempt by a Navy Seal team to rescue an American family being held by the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas. The enemy was tipped off by a corrupt Philippine general. The Seals were ambushed. Rapp comes into the picture and carries out a successful rescue operation that dispenses with the general. The story then shifts to the middle-east (Israel,Palestine, Saudi's). A somewhat sympathetic character is the Palestinian terrorist David who orchestrates some very clever plots. Irene Kennedy, the CIA Director is fighting the good battle. Rapp's wife, a tv reporter is a bit too much. It's hard to imagine a guy like Mitch Rapp going for her. Anyway,it's a fairly good read."
4,Irene Kennedy & Mitch Rapp run the show,"Rapp evolves into a man AND a super-secret-agent. Kennedy becomes the leader she was groomed to be. And yes, people are trying to make nukes in the middle east. Another thrill ride!"
4,One of the Best,"This was one of the best Flynn books and I've read them, in order, needing only to read Memorial Day and Consent to Kill. Once again, a good share of violence, sneaky politicians, and backstabbing. This book has a scene in the Phillipines that is really well done. Irene Kennedy's character is becoming much more well rounded and the ""wife"" is still a pain. I keep hoping Mitch Rapp will dump her."
5,Vince Flynn series,"I bought this series for our son in Alaska and a set for myself. I have not had time to read it yet, but our son tells us it was a good series and he enjoyed reading all the books."
4,"Executive Power, Vince Flynn","Another good book by Vince Flynn. Once again Mitch Rapp and ""Company"" are out to solve many of the post 9/11 problems of the world. If you like Tom Clancy, Steven Coonts, David Hagberg, you will love Flynn. As with other writers his stories get better with each new book. Executive Power is a good read, but Flynn definitely gets better with his books after this one. Memorial Day, Consent to Kill, Transfer of Power are the best books so far by Flynn. If you haven't read Flynn, start with his first book and read them in order, it is the best way to read his books."
4,Mitch Rapp is at it again,"Another great story from Vince Flynn. Exciting as always with a lot of twists and turns. Rapp, Kennedy, Hayes, all our favorite characters are back for another CIA spy drama."
1,Book was great. Condition was not as advertised,"Great book but the condition was pitiful. The book came from the Philadelphia Public Library and boy has it taken a beating. What really got me was that I have ordered quite a few used books for cheap. This one was more expensive than the others but as I said, the quality was poor while it wax advertised in very good condition. I would not trust this seller again."
3,Mitch Rapp,Thought it was a fair read not quick up to the standards of Vince Flynn's other books. Will continue to read his novels however
3,My first Flynn novel,"I found my first Vince Flynn novel an interesting read. However, I kept expecting the two plots to come together at some point and they never did. So it was basically two separate stories wrapped up in one book. A little strange. I found the complicated detail of ME politics and the details on how the special forces operate interesting. I'll read other Vince Flynn novels."
4,Vince Flynn keeps me coming back for more,"Like all fans of mystery and suspense novels, Vince Flynn consistently provides a good read. In my case he provides a good listen when I am on the road."
2,a lukewarm thriller with a pathetic marriage,"the on-the-rock marriage scenes are pathetic, making this already lukewarm and loose thriller become even worse. from the very beginning, this female washington reporter knew what mitch rapp did for a living, yet she continuously whined, intervened, demanded, complained, pried into her husband jobs and duties. what is this? trying to make rapp look more humanly realistic, making him look more like the stereotyped american husband? making us enable to enter rapp's bedroom, wathching 'war of the roses'? come on, this is a thriller, not jackie collins or danielle steele's 'honey, no sex tonight'. get rid of the nagging wife pronto! also, this novel is not up to the standard of a good thriller. a story falling apart in many ways."
5,"Vince Flynn bests Tom Clancy, predicts future","Just as he did in Separation of Power with Uday Hussein and the war on Iraq, Vince Flynn once again predicts the future by telling the story of a terrorist from the House of Saud and then days later seeing the real thing happen in Saudi Arabia. Not only that, but as with most of Flynn's amazing books, this one is suspenseful, yet not dissapointing. Mixing both conservative and liberal views, this book does not have the same violent passion for violence that Clancy's do. Also, unlike Clancy, Flynn makes the technical aspects of the military tools sound fun and exciting. Vince Flynn is back!! Buy this book and you won't regret it."
4,criminally slept on,"This was a very promising debut.The cd only has a few songs that are worth skipping. Alfonzo can blow and he co-wrote almost all of the songs on the cd. The best songs are just the way, and the seductive slow motion and would you be mine.Which are two songs that come in handy for setting a romantic mood. It's a shame we probably won't see another album from him. Alfonzo needs to use his brother eric sermon's connects, and drop another album, because he is extremley talented. If you find this cd copp it on site!"
4,This CD is not to be over looked!,"I have played this Cd for a number of people of different back grounds. All agree that it is easy to listen to, very well put together and song wonderfully. I am waiting for this young brother to put out a new project. It is good to finally get some good singing and good music all on the same CD."
3,a decent compilation,"This is an OK overview of Small Faces. Of course, Talk to You and Itchycoo Park are included, but Small Faces didn't have any stateside hits, so the hit- or non-hit- status of these songs shouldn't have made a difference in their selections.""Song of a Baker"" is one of the many good songs left off of this compilation. ""E too D"" is yet another.They were an excellent band, with Beatlesesque pop, a hint of power pop, and a little psychedelic element all mixed up with great songwriting.This is a decent compilation, but you might just want to pick up the first album ""Small Faces"" instead."
2,Not their best work,"This was the first ablbum I bough of the Small Faces, and I almost was turned off completley. Besides stuff like Itchycoo Park this is mediocer cd. It doesn't display their mod like talents. If You want their Mod work like All or Nothing or Green Circles don't buy this beccuase this is a totally diffrent type of Small Faces, I'd suggest this for the Odgen's fans probably, they would enjoy it more than a mod fan of the Small Faces."
5,Comfortable fit,I liked them...fit perfectly! I'm satisfied w the outcome of them. They r really cute.. Thinking about ordering another pair really soon! They didn't fit real tight at all and the material it's made from felt comfortable.
2,Boring and Potentially Unbelievable,"I was very disappointed in this book. Richard and ""K"" appear to be wishy washy liberals who get caught up in the anti-apartheid South African government ""Movement"". As a result of an unexpected request from a Movement leader, they spend the next two years in Tanzania and Zambia doing very little constructive for either themselves or the Movement. In the Afterword, the author says, ""If pressed, I would have to say that this book is 'really' a fiction of the actual"". I do not like wasting time and this book has 500 pages of the exactly that. I'd give it 1 star, but some may like some of the background to how the Movement is like any other political party; full of people hungry for power and their own personal benefit."
2,No liner notes,This is the first time I ever ordered an original cd online and there were no liner notes available. Pretty disappointed with the cd packaging as well.
4,We enjoy Jack Higgins.,"I've found him and read all his books, so after awhile I needed a little break, but do enjoy them very much."
3,Lack Higgins A prayer for the dying,"Too light ! Not gripping. The plot is predictable and full of re-used characters: the ""fighting"" priest, the ""good"" bad man, etc."
4,"Fitz this, Fitz that","I had read a review where someone thought the Masques of Gold was their favorite book so I checked it out. After I got into the book I thoroughly enjoyed it. It confused me at first with all the ""Fitz's."" After I was able to keep separate FitzWalter and FitzAilwyn, I could finally stay on track. I later found out that FITZ means the son of. It would of have helped if I had known that before. Great book--would recommend! It certainly shows how love is blind and how two people are really meant to be together. Another good phrase is....in the eye of the beholder!"
5,Slice & Dice,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this sword set. Beautifully crafted, heavy and articulated the set stands out on display. Could definitely be used for self-defense if needed. The blades and insignias are very detailed. Worth every penny of the already low purchase price."
1,Not happy at all,I orderd this for my sons bday it arived on time but when he opend the box the case on the brides sword was broke in half. The swords are awsome but the one case is broke. I have emailed the seller twice to get it replaced but they have never answerd. Do not buy
3,poor quality,I gave this review three stars only because the shipping was prompt. However the product was inferior. The stand does not work and the gold on the sword scabbords was already tarnished when it arrived.
3,Not bad but not the best.,I'm happy with my purchase but wasn't happy when I got them and they were extremely dirty and had some sort of grease on them. There's better quality out there but for what it is I like them.
5,Great wall hanger.,"They are really nice. I collect swords and these two look great hanging on the wall. They come in dull but most swords do, and are easy to sharpen. No rattles in the handle, blades are nice, wrapping tight, sheath free of scratches and looks good. I would recommend for a collector piece. Even if you don't like the movies they are nice."
2,Charger Yes: Transmitter No.,"The unit works fine for charging my sandisk mp3 player, but I can not get a clear broadcast through any of the available FM frequencies."
1,Do not buy this,The transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do.
2,You Could Do Better,"For the value, you could do better. Found a few other FM Transmitters around the same price that had more options. For example, the availability of only 3 preset AM stations to choose from is a real down side. When all 3 stations get horrible reception, you're left out of luck unless you tinker with the cords or sit still. I found that keeping my hand directly on the transmitter will alleviate some of the fuzz, but who wants to drive like that? Other than that, it works, just not well. I highly suggest to keep looking."
5,FANTASTIC VALUE!!!!!,This is a fantastic value. It is so much easier to use than other similiar products I've purchased in the past. It is well worth the price.
4,plug,I like that I don't have all the wires hanging in the car. The sound is good the majority of the time.
2,"Works all right, but not for everyone","If you're listening to MP3s, etc from spoken word, then this will work fine. A problem with the product is that as I drive I often have to change the frequency. OK for the non-audiophile, but subpar for the person that really wants to listen to his music."
1,Buy something else,"Performance was mediocre, but still OK for the $15 price tag, but after not many days, it just crapped out."
2,OK transmitter,"It works, but you have to turn up the volume up very high most of the time. OK for podcasts but I would not dream of using it for music."
5,The Greatest,Excellent book with wonderful personal insight into a man who captivated the world and the sport of boxing. This is a must read for any Muhammad Ali fan.
4,The Greatest,"Excellent Ali biography. With very little narrative by the author, it is mostly a collection of interviews by those in Ali's life from the beginning to the end of his career-- his parents, his trainers, his friends, his enemies, his opponents, his aquaintances."
3,A good deal of Ali,"The author has compiled a book that is exhaustive in its history on the great man. There seems to be nothing left out on him but it is so tiring to read page after page (500 plus) of glorification of Ali.I found that even a huge fan like myself was getting bored of the countless pages devoted to Ali's religion, health and finances.I think the book could have dropped at least 150 pages, possibly 200, and still have been a good read."
5,a great book about the greatest,from the first time i got the book and read it i was so happy.this man was a genius in the ring and a human force outside of it.this book showcases all the many sides of the greatest.very compelling and full of insight.it showcases the myths&mystic of the man.one of the greatest bios that i've ever read.
4,"Good book about Ali's accomplishments, but . . .","For those who want to know about the real Ali, I recommend ""The Tao Of Muhammad Ali"" by Davis Miller, which offers far more about the person rather than dates and figures. I enjoyed ""Muhammad Ali: His Life And Times"", it had a lot of things in it I didn't know, but if you want to read just one great book about Ali, then make it ""The Tao Of Muhammad Ali""."
3,Shades of Ali worship,"Thomas Hauser's definitive work on Ali uses a somewhat unconventional style in that he culls quotations from different interviews ranging from Ali's cook to Joe Frazier to paint quite a unique portrait of Ali unlike any other book.Though much research has been done through interviews of people each of which provide a unique perspective on Ali, it could have helped if Hauser could have interviewed more of Ali's detractors to provide a more well-rounded picture of the icon. The last part of the book pulls out all the stops and proceeds to venerate Ali to the detriment of painting a multi-dimensional picture of the 20th century's greatest athlete.An educational read but could have used a more unbiased treatment."
1,Rubbish,"I must say that I was looking forward to getting this Album but what a disappointment!!! I am surprised that Jonsi (Sigur Ros) has lent his voice on that project (5 minutes of vocals out of 90 min). I listen to all sort of music Neo-Folk, Industrial, New Wave, Goth, Death Metal, Experimental but this album is not avant-garde, not experimental it is just Rubbish! (2cd's of irritating music loop that goes nowhere, I'd rather listen to the radio than that, well, if I had one!)"
4,Guaranteed Christmas Cheer from the Rat Pack Era,"This CD makes me laugh out loud.That's saying something. Christmas is often a stressful time.I love the CD, I love the concept, I love the packaging, I love the liner notes.I suppose if I lived in the ""swinging"" era of night clubs, pointy bras, martinis, and ashtrays on every table, I would find it all a big drag; I don't smoke, don't drink, and I'm a feminist.But, at this safe distance, the swinging, Rat Pack era is an archaelogical trove of great fun.And, heck, these people really knew their way around a song. Even as I'm laughing at the anachronisms in the CD, I'm enjoying the heck out of some really good music. Kay Starr, Nancy Wilson, Nat King Cole -- these folks had pipes, and the bands are tight.I think that if this CD can't shake someone out of his holiday blues, then hospitalization might be the only route."
5,Fantastic album,"Some absolute gems on this wonderful xmas album. But please can someone tell me who sings/speaks on the bonus track ""Violets for your furs""? Help!!!!"
4,Not your average Christmas cd!,"I love track #3, which totally reminds me of the tune to the original Dating Game...It'll get you into the spirit of the season if Elvis' carols don't do it for you. It was definitely a hit at our Christmas party last year...everyone was raving about it. The follow-up album, however, isn't as good..."
3,Disappointing!,"I love christmas music and have several christmas CD's in my collection. As you can see by the other reviews, you will either love this CD or it will leave you rather frosty cold. If you are anticipating some nice jazz background music or some modernized christmas carols look elsewhere. This CD offers some vintage music which you may have heard during the 60's at an office christmas party or in some upscale night club. There are a few memorable performances here and overall, better music can be found elsewhere. Recommended only for fans of retro or big band."
3,Beg To Differ With LoungeLizard7...,"First of all, this is a so-so holiday album, there are more cheesy cuts than great ones, though the great ones are definitely worth a listen for years to come. Second of all, the end cut, Jingle Bells was sung by none other than then-President of Capitol Records, Mr. Johnny Mercer. You can't miss his singing style with that charming Savannah, Georgia drawl. If you own any of Johnny Mercer's actual recordings, you will KNOW that it is definitely him singing that tune!"
4,Love to listen to this,"The very first song takes me right to I dream of Jeannie and to Austin Powers... You can't listen to this cd and not just laugh. It's upbeat and fun to listen to. A couple of the songs sound like they came out of an old roller rink or campy pizza place but overall, it's very enjoyable to listen to. I'm 45 years old and am on the edge of the age where you are going to enjoy this. Any younger and your too young!"
5,A novel and refreshing and break from standard holiday fare!,"As a Christmas music nut, I listen to Christmas music about 11 months of the year, and it takes something very unique to catch my attention. This CD grabbed me by both ears--I love it!"
4,Good christmas standard lounge music.,"This is a good compilation of schmaltz from the days when bad habits were the rule, and being hip was Perry Mason having a car phone. The music is mostly good,a few cuts are great, and there are a couple of dogs too. It is in regular rotation at my house for Christmas."
4,Helps fill out the Christmas music selection.,"A welcome addition to our Xmas music collection. Fun, varied and not overly hipster, it is a a nice change of pace from Bing Crosby and Bach in December."
3,Not Quite Bioenergetics,"The book is scholarly rather than insightful. I missed the passion of any engagement, unlike Hilton's Relational Somatic Psychotherapy. Somewhat helpful"
5,A Joy,"Though I often wished she would pause more on her musical excerpts, this book is very wise, and anyone interested in understanding meaning in music intellectually must read this book."
1,because it IS awful,"It's a very strange thing when ""extremely harsh criticism"" is cited as evidence of value. Is it just possibly that this book was harshly criticized because it deserves to be, because it is a very sorry excuse for a work of musical--and, for that matter, sociological--scholarship? I think it IS possible. I think it is more than possible; I think it is quite likely. It is ""readable"" for non-musicians not in spite of its ""scholarly content"", but only in that it lacks ""scholarly content""; it is not particularly well written. Obviously, it has its partisan proponents--the sort of people who don't like having to think subtly or deeply but who still want to be taken seriously, the sort of pseudo-intellectual people who want to have it both ways--, but this is no recommendation."
1,eminently forgettable,"No, this book certainly does not address the question, ""Why have there been so few women composers?"". Rather, it addresses the question, ""Why does Madonna wear underwear outside her outerwear?"" I'm not making this up. It goes on at length about the musical significance of Madonna (without actually discussing her music, such as it is). This sort of thing is not a blemish, not a minor flaw; it's the whole book, front to back. This book may well influence a new generation of pseudo-scholars, but it is unlikely to influence a generation of scholars--or, for that matter, a single scholar--, because it is not itself a work of scholarship. It is ""maligned"" for a very good reason, but it is better ignored. (By the way, my unabridged dictionary and I are unfamiliar with the term ""oftly"". ""Oft"" is an adverb already.)"
5,"""Three cheers for Anita! Hip, hip! Hurray!""","Despite what the YOLANDA wrote, I thought this book was excellent. It's fun to be able to escape into a fantasy world for a little while. And for your information YOLANDA, the very word FICTION implies fantasy and therefore, to answer your question, yes, you do have STUPID stamped on your forehead."
1,Celestial Hormones,"I have found this among many other Anita (hormonal therapy) Stansfield books to be the equal to an LDS Harlequinn. Get real Anita! Does real life happen this way? Do I have STUPID stamped on my forehead? If I wanted to read Smut, I shouldn't need to go to the Mormon Fiction section of my library. By the way, have you heard the good one about Anita S. and Richard Paul Evans? It's one of those Celestial Affairs...."
1,Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z Z,I really hate to leave a book unfinished but I was sorely tempted to with this bomb. I agree that the book showed an extreme lack of regional research on the part of the author. One of the first rules of good writing is to stick with what you know. Anita Stansfield obviously doesn't know anything about Australia. Hopefully the characters emigrate to a more familiar setting in her succeeding books but I don't intend to find this out for myself. Yes it detailed some characters with high morals and the high morals won out. But the message loses much in the sloppy delivery. I'm glad I borrowed it from a friend and didn't waste money buying it.
1,Australian Whiners,"Soap opera names, profuse whining, shallow characters...Reading my kids old Goosebump books would have been a better use of my time."
1,Porn for the religious,"This book is ridiculous. It is chock full of thrusting, throbbing, moaning, hoarse utterances and all manner of endless ""not quite sex"". That is all the book has. The plot stinks. The characters are ridiculous and unsympathetic. The setting was clearly inspired by the author watching ""The Man from Snowy River"". Every scene is repeated several times with very slight variations. I guess it is supposed to be a moral book since the two main characters never actually have sex before marriage. However, they spend the entire book behaving in really immoral self centered and stupid ways.If you are offered the choice between reading this book and a concussion- choose the concussion. Your brain will heal faster."
5,Fabulous!! I couldn't put it down.,"It's the story of Michael Hamilton's great-grandprents. Michael and Emily's love story is contained in the first three of Anita's books. I also recommend them. If you have read the first three stories I highly recommend this book as a page-turner. It is impossible to put it down, especially if you like historic romances. It's fun to have continuing characters because you already identify with them somewhat."
1,NO... muy mal !!!,"La descripción del producto NO corresponde con el artículo que me llegó !!! El cd venía rayado y NO me envió el artículo completo, le faltó la caja roja. No recomiendo a éste vendedor porque engaña a sus compradores."
3,If you are a fan of Christina Aguilera,"If you are a fan of Christina Aguilera and are a fan of remixes,get this CD. You will get the original CD of Christina's first album and a CD of remixes of some of her songs like Come on Over and I turn to you."
5,Great Read !!!!,"This was a very entertaining book, providing some unique insights into the English language. I couldn't put it down !!!!"
5,Great book,This book goes to the heart of the problems. It actually tells the reader what can be done to enhance the total experience with background on factors that are more than hype. Many books go through a lot of stuff that by 50 you are well aware. This book gives the reader actual background and realistic expectation of social experiences.
4,Sex Over 50,"I give this a four star it is very knowledgable, not quite what I expected. It give me a new prespective about sex."
2,"I didn't like it, since it was all a joke.","I wanted something to make my life better, sexier, more meaningful and this is just a joke book. Like maybe I shouldn't even like sex...or should not want it? Anyhow, information is all around us, I found it in a book called Free to Be Me by Arthur Vonshtain. Good luck and don't hesitate to look for ""it"" it is awesome!"
2,"Mostly antidotal evidence. Some science info, but very general. Some soft erotica stories.","You can find the info you are looking for at reputable web sites (Mayo clinic, webMD...). Mostly this book is a bunch of stories about people in their 50s finding out that they can be sexy and desirable in mid-life."

5,A CD for a person who likes sarina paris or any vocal trance,"I love any song with Vocals in the trance. Its hard to make a good trance song with just beats. Vocals add another type of music to the song. I recommend to anyone who likes sarina paris, Inoj, rollergirl, or many others to get this one."
2,Typical club sound,"I've heard a little of this CD, and there wasn't anything special about it. Just typical club music. Good to dance to, but nothing to waste money on, unless you're a DJ."
2,Well...not the BEST,"This is an okay collection if you are looking for all of the ""basics"" (""Heart Full Of Soul"", Shapes Of Things"", and ""For Your Love""). But the sound quality is poor. A lot of distortion, and not very ""rich"" sound. In many songs, you can't hear the drums as well as you can in their other collections. I think my biggest disappointment was the inaccurate track listing. It was supposed to have the rarly-heard sitar version of ""Heart Full Of Soul"", but instead had only the regular version. If you are a hardcore Yardbirds fan, pass this one by. If you just simply want to get aquainted with the Yardbirds and their most familiar tracks, and you aren't concerned with high-quality sound, this may be the album for you. --Certainly not my favorite"

2,"Of historic interest, but dead boring.","I found most of the poems in this collection to be dry and boring, on topics that were not timeless. I imagine a historian might find them more engaging.I have had better luck with Kenneth Rexroth's translations of Chinese and Japanese poems. Perhaps he has chosen poems that I found more engaging than those in this collection."
4,CourseBuilder is a free extension for Dreamweaver 4,"Macromedia is including CourseBuilder as a free extension in Dreamweaver 4, which will be released in December.Product rating is high. However Macromedia's instructions and tutorials are very poor, rating a bare 1 star."
2,Not Mr Slywotzky's best work,i am a big fan of Adrian Slywotzky. The Profit Zone and The Upside are two of the most powerful business books I have read. The art of Profitability was a waste of time. painful to dredge through. weak principles compared to the brilliance in prior work.
4,Great read in small doses,The book's content is structured well and it provides situational examples to solidify each main idea.
4,enjoy the CD,"Got this business CD for Christmas, and haven't been able to resist the temptation to listen to more than one track per day, let alone per week. For the most part, it is very well ""acted"" and easy to listen to, although often the chart descriptions are too poor and too breif to figure out in your head.Like other folks said, the suggested reading/listening is a great list of ""get to"" titles, and SO WHAT if he drops in a couple of his own titles along with others? Zig Ziglar, Brian Tracy, Earl Nightengale, etc have been doing that for years before, and besides we could all learn something from the sly pitch - yet another profit model to study about - so don't feel like you've been taken advantage of just because you didn't think of it yourself, he he he!"
3,"Moderate Book, but not worth","Easy to read (I read all the book in 2-3 hours doing all the exercises), but not worth to that price.The book just include several graphs on profits, and how to think in a profit manner.Let me propose you an alternative; read ""Mind of Strategist"" from Ohmae, then look to different industries in DowJones, and think of how to make more profit in each industry.. I think that you can draw at least 50% of all those charts..The issue is not drawing the charts.. but how to execute the pricing strategy.. are all the world businessman dumb that they can not apply the pricing charts that can be developed in a minute???This book is best for just practice of thinking, not worth more than 2-3 USD."
5,If you want to UNDERSTAND PROFITS look no further,"this is one of the best books on strategy I have seen and read. QUite frankly it is comparable to Goldratts ""The Goal"". This should be a required reading for every executive, business owner and marketing strategist.I have purchased 10 copies of this book to distribute among my friends, BUY IT and READ IT and you will know why it can be ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS as you move from CHAOS TO CONFUSION in the world of how PROFITS CAN BE MADE"
4,Interesting little parables to get you thinking,"I liked the structure of this book, and the approach of using parables - it makes it easy to read & absorb the principles. However, given my level of business experience, I wasn't a rookie setting out to learn everything from scratch.I considered the instruction ""read only one chapter per week"" to be supercilious.A typical chapter is only 10 pages or so (some are as short as 5, the longest is 14), but as there's 23 chapters I didn't want to spend 6 months reading this book. By reading 2 or 3 chapters per day, I could still absorb the message, and yet complete the book within 2 weeks."
3,"Subtitle could be ""the dance diva edition""","From down tempo old school 80s to house of the 90s, this one is filled with diva vocal (even Boy George). This great series suffers from one big problem-a very limited number of 12"" versions. Could have been a perfect series of hard to get tracks, if only it wasn't overloaded with mostly 3 and 4 minute versions, and only a couple of long versions-and the disc doesn't even run an hour. I was most disappointed to find that the near 6 minute mix of Industry's ""release Me"" was the soft house mix and not the vocal cut of the hardhouse version that dominated the clubs in New York City. Track times:1. I don't wanna lose your love (4:29)2. Turn it up (3:44)3. I wanna give you devotion (6:28)4. Somebody else's guy (6:25)5. As long as you're good to me (3:53)6. 3 is family (3:32)7. Same thing in reverse (3:57)8. Tres deseos (3:54)9. Feel the good times (3:53)10. Release me (5:46)11. Spend some time (5:09)12. Independence (4:00)"
4,"Mostly a good book, with some long stretches.","Cheney takes a job in a San Francisco hospital as its first female physician. Despite a few problems that erupt, for the most part she enjoys her job, with occasional outings with her friends. Shiloh meets Bain Winslow from Hawaii, who turns out to be his first real lead as to who his real parents are. Some parts of this book may seem frustrating, while others go very quickly. This is probably one of the most important books in the series (and of course, you have to read them all to know what's going on)!"
5,One of the best of the series!,This one was probably one of my favorites in the series. Tons of stuff happen between Cheney and Shiloh and it bridges into the next book.
1,Too Generic with some false information,"I bought this book on a whim since my cousins & I are at the age where we are getting married. This book may be useful if your family has been in this country for several generations or if you are not of Chinese ancestry. As a 1st generation American Born Chinese, I was hoping to ready more about the do's & don'ts - (i.e. the tea set used to serve tea for the new in-laws must be purchased by the bride, her family, or a friend.) Also, in the section about Chinese wedding banquets, she states that 'in China, 4 is a lucky number'. BAD MISTAKE. In some dialects, the pronunciation of the word four sounds like the Chinese pronunciation of DEATH. Eight is the luckiest number. I do Not recommend this book because of some mistakes and lack of interesting information."
5,Excellent collection of bass groove greats.,"Hello. I won't mince words here but this album kicks [butt]!! I am a beginner bass-player and I loves the sounds of bass. This collection of songs have grooves that will make you move on a hot summer day. Even if you're not a bass enthusiest like me, you can appreciate the grooves on this CD for any occasion; esspecially patio parties with a lot of tequila sunrises. This review submitted is merely a subjective one--I'm just getting this off my chest, hope it helps a little. :) Thanks for reading. :)"
2,"Shaky and flat black for painting, not textured plain black","The description needs to be updated - this has a flat black front for painting which looks silly if you aren't going to paint it, and looks really silly when you have a black (textured) mirror on the other side. Maybe I should have figured that out from the picture, but a clear statement that it is not the textured black would make sense. I bought my truck with a broken mirror, so when I put this on I had no idea how much it should vibrate. It was unusable. The mirror shook a lot. I returned it. I had a new glass put into the original body and it shakes too, though not as much. Maybe I need better shocks to dampen vibrations more? Either way it shakes noticeably more than the OEM mirror."
3,Worked well ... for about 6 months,"I like the thinness of the watch. It is lightweight. I find it stylish. It keeps time well.However, as several others have reported, my crystal broke ... for no apparent reason. I was sitting watching TV, checked the time. Checked again about 30 minutes later and the crystal was cracked. Didn't even hit it on anything.Other minor nit, the knob to change the time is very small and slick. Difficult to get a grip on it. Can be a problem if you need to correct the date."
2,Not all Titanium,"I bought this watch as a gift for my fiance' who has skin allergies because it is advertised as all titanium. After wearing his new watch his wrist began to break out around the area where the clasp touches his skin. Apparently, the watch and band are titanium, but they make the clasp with stainless steel (which he is allergic to). Very disappointing."
3,"Lightweight, attractive but very sensitive to scratches","This is a good overall watch as long as you are careful when wearing it.Pro's:- lightweight- small, low profile- easily adjustable band- keeps good timeCon's:- both the face and band scratch if you look harshly at them- band locking mechanism can be annoying."
3,Great Watch Except for Cracked Face,"Gave this watch to my husband as a gift and he loves it. Very lightweight and comfortable. He's a watch guy and chooses this one over the other watches he has. The big problem is that about three months after he got the watch, the face cracked. He still wears it because he likes it so much and I think he would want it again, even knowing it would break (he likes it that much). It's a pretty cheap watch, so it's not the end of the world to replace. However, this cracked face is really annoying."
2,"Beautiful watch, impractical band.","This is a beautiful watch. The band however is not functional for everyday wear. If you plan to use this only when going out or formal affairs, great. When the band breaks it is not easily replaceable. Mine broke and I bought a Timex."
5,Handsome watch,Handsome watch at very nice price. No issues with crystal breaking as was mentioned in other reviews. Keeps excellent time and very easy to read dial. Looks much more expensive than it is. Have had other Skagen watches but this is definitely the best looking. Very light and comfortable.Highly recommend this watch.
4,battery please,i like this watch however i noticed that it is not working. does it ship without a battery?
2,ho-hum watch,"This watch seemed a bit different than other Skagen watches that I have had or looked at and seemed a bit cheap looking. The pin holding the band on broke off after only a couple weeks. Although it keeps good time, it' not a great watch. Next time I buy a watch I think I will want to see it in person."
3,quality problem,"This watch is nice, but the quality is questionable: after two months the glass crystal cracked while I was sitting at my computer. Skagen would repair the watch, of course, but I have to pay S&H ($8.95 one way)! So I am still deciding what is chipper - repair this watch or by another."
3,Way too big,"Watch did look nice but was not as thin as advertised. But the biggest bummer for me, this watch was really big for my wrist. One needs to be a large statured person to get a nice fit on this watch. As I can not wear it much, I can not speak about its durability."
5,Boyfriend loves it!,"Bought this for my boyfriend, and though he said he doesn't like watches (for fear he's going to break it or lose it) he said this is the only watch he'd want to wear. It's thin mesh is subtle, and because it's so straightforward (no bells and whistles) it's perfect for what it is- a nice watch that will match a lot of what he will wear.Thanks!"
5,Looks great.,Is what I expected. I would buy it again. Great value. What else can I say as this is a great looking watch.
5,Well Received,"Th Skagen watch I received was just want I wanted and expected. Great style, light wieght, and very functional. Really enjoy wearing my new watch.......Arnie"
4,excellent timepiece,"This watch is quite nice and makes a fashion statement on any arm. However, the band leaves a little bit to be desired. While it is an attractive band, it is not as functional as expected. It does not wrap around the arm securely without turning a bit sideways and showing a bit of the end of the band. While this is not a severe problem, it is not 100% acceptable."
2,Clasp doesn't hold securely,This watch is lightweight and elegant in appearance. But the clasp loosened repeatedly in ordinary wear. I returned the item for credit.
2,same problem as others,"I bought the titanium watch because of the style and size - I have small wrists.The big negatives- as with some other reviewers, the crystal broke. I have no recollection of banging it. Just one day I saw it was broken. Secondly, the small hands and shiny surfaces make it hard to read except in good light.On the positive side, it looks good, and keeps good time. Be wary.CMJ"
2,"Good Watch, Terrible band","This is the second time I bought this Skagen watch through Amazon, most recently in Nov. 2012. I love the look of the watch and how it performs. However, both times the flex band broke. The band can't be replaced - I've tried to order new bands and taken the watches to watch makers with no success. You have to measure the look and utility of the watch against its poor flex band that will make it a short lived timepiece. Wish they had a different band. They have lost me as a client"
2,Looks and feels cheap,"Some things you just need to see them frst hand, this is an ok watch for the price but I dont really wear it"
2,Big Mistake,"I bought this watch thinking that it looked like a great quality product, and within 3 weeks of wearing it on and off, the wristband snapped off. Apparently it is adhered with a sort of epoxy. It didn't last. Now I have the watch, but no wristband. This did not happen because of a violent or abusive action to the watch, it was merely through daily wear and tear. This is a true account of my experience."
5,Skagen 233xlttm men's watch,"This is my second Skagen watch and I like them very much. They are thin and light and very comfortable. The band is solid and adjustable. This model, which my other one did not have, has a second hand and a larger date window. For a casual watch, this a great buy!"
4,Great GIft!,"I bought this watch as a graduation gift and he loves it! Like the lightweight, thin style and says it is very comfortable to wear. It took us a minute to figure out how to adjust the ""link"" but we got it! Skagen was highly recommended and we agree!"
4,"Mostly good,",Pro: Great looking watch; sleek design and lightweight.Con: The watch band is a little on the delicate side. I somehow dented the edge of the band while working at my desk job. The damage caused a piece of the metal band to protrude which kept getting caught on my shirt until I bent it in with my fingernail. Luckily the damage isn't too noticable because it is near the clasp where people won't usually see it.The watch is still useable but hopefully it won't happen again or get worse.
1,"if you wear your watch upside-down, don't buy this","I wear my watches upside-down, with the face on the inside of my wrist. I could not go longer than 3 hours or so without the adjustment knob popping out and stopping the watch. Looks great, but at that point, it's just useless jewelery."
4,light and thin,"if you want to use a light watch that meets your basic needs this is it, good for peopl in suits because it doesnt bulk."
5,Kick Ass,"Looked at it, bought it and love it. Also I tell everyone I paid 3 or 4 times what the price was, and they believe it. It's a fun watch ;o},"
4,Good Watch. Good Price.,"An older Skagen watch. Same Swedish style, same ultra-thin body. Great price.Bought to replace a similar, newer Skagen titanium watch whose crystal had cracked. Didn't notice any bump against the watch, but the crystal cracked, which is the first time I've ever had that happen, including with about 4 other Skagens I own. A problem with the Skagen thin design? We'll see."
4,Good,"Nice looking watch. Is not exactly accurate, loses a few seconds a week.Was originally a doubter of the mesh band but it does look a lot better in person."
4,Good looking watch,"Was concerned when buying this based on other reviews saying the face cracks easily. I've had the watch for about a month. No problems so far.Very sexy watch, feels good on. It took me a bit to figure out the clasp, but once I did, I really like the design.The only con -- the band is not as flexible as it appears around the face part. It bends only so much then stops. For someone with small wrists, it can bend and wrap around your wrist so much. But not so bad to make this a concern. I still really like it."
4,Skagen Watch,I bought this watch as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves that Skagen watches are so thin and light weight. This one is no exception. The true test will be how much he actually wears it.
4,Great Value and Style,"This watch is very lightweight and thin, just as I wanted. Keeps perfect time, and I have not had any issues with the band, as some others have noted. I have gotten several compliments on the look of the watch, and it is extremely comfortable to wear. At this price I will likely buy another in a different finish. In fact, the only thing preventing me from giving the watch 5 stars is that I tend to bang my watches into things frequently, and the case seems to scratch easily."
4,Good value for money,"Very nice watch. Titanium mesh very attractive and durable. My only concern is that the black face plate is hard to read in poor light. Regardless I would recommend this purchase for a formal, casual, appearance."
4,Good value-attractive design,"I am very pleased with the Skagen Titanium watch. I purchased it as second watch to wear while playing golf. It is very lightweight, attractive and has a very solid clasp mechanism. I could easily wear it for business or dress-up. At the price, it can't be beat."
5,First CD - Not Unclean,Paisley has a unique talent and his first CD is fantastic. I have been moved by this cd and my faith has been renewed! Thank you Paisley for sharing your love of music and the gifts that God has given to you on this CD.
4,Expansion & Conflict,"This book does an excellent job of describing the tensions of our country as it grew in the early-mid 19th century. It brought up some interesting facts that I had never known, such as, serious discussion within key leaders of Congress in the 1840s that the U.S. should forcibly take Canada from Great Britain."
5,American History Freebie,I teach American history in a local community college. This book has been a valuable reference guide for the period of Manifest Destiny. Highly recommend the volume and it is a special deal on Kindle so it is very inexpensive.
2,"A little interesting, but quite liberal","I read this book as compulsary course literature at the university. What I found interesting was the presentation - and the comparison - between the different coventants in the Old Testament. What I question, and disagree with, is that the author seems to believe in the Documentary Hypothesis, and that he believes there are three authors to the book of Isaiah. There are also other examples of liberal theology, but some facts are interesting. However, I would not have bought, or read, the book if it was not course literature."
5,response to reader from Worcester review,"Please note that the author is not Steve Bishop (he is assistant) but Bernhard W. Anderson, emeriatus professor of Old Testament Theology, Princeton Theological Seminary"
2,Looks dingy and feels cheap,"Just received the sheets in Heather color. My first impression was: Has it been so hot in the UPS truck that the sheets turned yellowish? I opened the plastic cover, and found that not only the color look dull and dingy, but it feels like more like cheap 200-thread-count sheets (and it's cheap, $21.99, I guess?) May be the quality of thread is poor, therefore, the thread-count would not matter. 300-Thread-Count usually would feel a lot smoother and you wouldn't see the 'holes' in between the threads so clearly. I quickly removed all the other Martex 300-thread-count sheets (other colors) from my cart."
4,Good value,"Got a good deal - free flat sheet with purchase of fitted. Very pleased that even after three washings the fitted sheet (with elastic all the way around) cleanly fits over my 17"" mattress. There was a lot of shrinkage during the first washing (the fabric puckered near every stitch) and the fabric feels a little thin. Not sure how well they will hold up but they are not scratchy so that's a plus. I paid $36 for a queen size flat sheet, queen size fitted sheet and 2 king size pillow cases and I think this was a fair price."
5,Nice product,Very smooth and Comfortable. We have been using it since almost a year and it looks pretty even now. Highly recommended
4,"Like wine, it mellows with time...","Without going into depth on each selection, I want to confess that this music seemed incoherent and cold at first hearing. The third or fourth time around, I began to submerge through the harmonic dissonance and rhythmic turbulance, to the deep brooding calm that underlies these shimmering musical surfaces. Beware: this is chamber music, not smooth jazz. Ravi Colrane never goes for the quick emotional punch, the repeated riff, the funky bass line, or the familiar chord resolution. The listener must follow each thread through a complex, abstract, sonic tapestry. Emotion is never an end in itself, but always the effect of structural complexity. It's dry wine, not Pepsi. It's Proust, not beach reading. I may end up listening to this as often as I listen toA Love Supreme."
2,Poor Customer service,"This unit will charge deep cycle marine batteries and auto batteries (Wet Cell only). I would not use this on AGM or Gel batteries.Within a year both alligator clips broke under normal use on standard battery terminals. Not good. They told me I had to send the entire unit back both times. Instead of just sending me a new termnal, the girl said that would void the warrenty.Let see , top dollar for the charger itself. 2 UPs shipping charges waiting for the unit to be repaired two times...........I'd look elsewhere before buying this unit again.I hope this is helpful.D.H."
1,Worked OK for a while.,"This was very tempermental, often giving an error message that something is wrong with the battery. I tried it on the same battery yesterday, and got three different messages in 3 consecutive tries. Saying battery was full, then a bad cell, and finally not connected. I tried it on 2 other cars which were both less than 3 years old, and both had ""bad"" batteries. I never did get my battery charged. There has to be better choices."
3,Not what you think ....,"I ordered this CD based on the track listing provided and found that you don't get some of the songs listed ... Mama, Desperado, etc. The music is good, but some of the stuff listed that I really wanted wasn't on the CD sent!!!"
5,Ray proves he was the best vocalist that Genesis ever lost,"This is a terrific transitional album between Genesis: Calling All Stations and Ray Wilson: Change. It includes the best of Ray's outings with Cut and Stiltskin as well as incredible versions of Genesis and Genesis related songs. Ray's versions of Genesis classics demonstrate why Tony and Mike chose him to replace Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel. Where this album really shines is in Ray's treatment of his own songs. Ray Wilson should be an international superstar, and probably would be if Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford had the foresight to continue with Genesis and allow Ray to show what he can do as singer and song writer to a broader audience."
2,GOOD...YET BAD.,"BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR OUR 25 LB. DACHSHUND/ JACK RUSSEL MIX. SHE'S A HARD PULLER WHEN YOU START OUT WALKING AND SHE CHOKES HERSELF, BUT AFTER 15 MINUTES, SHE'LL WALK AT A NORMAL PACE. THE 1ST TIME I TRIED THE HARNESS, I NOTICED SHE WAN'T PULLING HARD AT ALL INITIALLY (DOING WHAT IT'S DESIGNED TO DO!). BUT AFTER SHE BEGAN WALKING AT A NORMAL PACE, THE HARNESS KEPT SLIPPING OFF FROM UNDER FRONT LEGS (REMEMBER...SHORT LEGS ON A DACHSHUND/ JACK RUSSEL MIX). ALSO, THE COMFORT PADS UNDER EACH LEG KEPT RIDING UP OUT OF PLACE. THESE 2 PROBLEMS HAPPENED SEVERAL/MANY TIMES DURING THE COURSE OF OUR WALK, CAUSING ME TO STOP AND RE-ADJUST THE HARNESS. BUY THE END OF OUR WALK, I WAS GLAD I DIDN'T PAY TOO MUCH FOR THE PRODUCT, AND WISHED I'D STUCK HER STANDARD COLLAR IN MY POCKET SO I COULD HAVE SWITCHED. I NOW REALIZE THIS ITEM WAS DESIGNED FOR DOGS WITH LONGER LEGS. A STANDARD DOUBLE (UNDER LEG) HARNESS WOULD PROBABLY WORK BETTER, AT A REDUCED COST.SO...SHORT-LEGGED DOG OWNERS...BEWARE!!!"
1,"Does not stay on my dog, ill fitting","I have had a whole bunch of halters for my dog (45lb beagle mix) but I should've known from this cheap price that it would be equally cheaply made. This one won't even stay on my dog - when she bends over to sniff something, the arms dangle and she can get out of it. I've tried tightening it and certainly bought the right size, but it is so ill-fitting I just threw it away. What a waste. I guess it helped with pulling, but if it doesn't stay on then what's the difference."
5,It really works!,"Works great to stop my very energetic 35 lb. border collie mix from pulling. It seems comfortable for her, and is also much easier to put on than a conventional harness."
5,Best Of The Hi Records Years Ann Peebles,I really enjoyed listening to the CD. It was of good quality. I have no issues with the songs at all.
3,A Bit Disappointed,"I am new to Ann Peebles, and I have to say that I am a little disappointed in the quality of this CD. Ann herself is great, and the CD has to potential to be great, but I found that on several of the songs, Ann sounds either like she's in a tunnel or I have cotton in my ears. I think that it's a function of poor quality recording and/or remastering. There are plenty of tunes on here, though, and my solution is to copy it to my computer's Media Library and then delete the individual songs that I think have poor sound quality and just not listen to them. Of course, there's always the possibility that the copy I bought last month is defective, but I don't think that's the case, since many of the songs sound just fine. Perhaps you should spend your money on a different Ann Peebles collection. It's worth spending your money on her, just not this particular CD... although it is pretty inexpensive!"
5,loud,"well ive honestly never played before i got this. i probly should have bought a cheaper one to start with. i love it, its stood up to hours and hours of being beat on. ive gotten somewhat good and i love this snare."
4,Good outside-the-box design book,"I am a regular reader of Scott Kelby's and Jack Davis's Photoshop books. So when I came across Kim's Image Effects title I was not sure if the content would hold any interest, but it did. And it did it quite well.The material covered has more of a Gen-X flavor than that of Kelby or Davis. But it is explained in the same easy-to-follow way. It's definitely worth picking up. It adds an outside-the-box method of design to Photoshop work."
5,A Must Have!,"Paganism at its core. The ways and means of the true Pagan lifestyle. Non of the fluff of Wicca, Magic or Spellwork. Paganism before the influx of Christianity destroyed the Pagan way of life. Kudos to Mr. Gorham!"
5,I saw him play solo in Dublin last year ...,"and he was excellent. Sadly, he played to a less than full house - which is a poor reflection on my native Dubliners appreciation of good music. I am disappointed that this album does not include ""Do what you gotta do"" - which is by far and away one of the best songs ever. Nina Simone covers this song and her verison would bring a tear to a glass eye. You should watch out for it."
3,Ten Easy Pieces,"Webb is a fine songwriter and pianist, but he's too interested in singing along with his playing. I purchased Ten Easy Pieces in hope that Webb's long rendition of MacArthur Park was the fine piano solo of the piece I had been looking for. I'm still looking."
3,"Jimmy Webb, Musician","'If You See Me Getting Smaller, I'm Leaving' was my first serious introduction to Mr. Webb, musically speaking via a legendary air personality, Steve Dahl (WCKG-FM, 105.9, Chicago, 2-7, Weekdays CDT) who championed Jimmy's music and his Chicagoland appearances and about that time the 'Ten Easy Pieces' CD was released and played on Dahl's show and I became enamored of it. Dahl used 'If You See Me...' as his swan song whenever he was fired or quit a radio station. 'Galveston' and 'Witchita Lineman' are superior; my absolute favorites on the 'Ten Easy Pieces' CD. The rest, as far as I'm concerned, is serviceable filler."
2,Great Songwriter...but,Listen... no one likes his songs better than I and read his book which is also good... but not this album. The piano is too dominant.. and his vocals just can't come to the point. Pass on this if you want the music... if you want the mystique go for it but don't think he needs the money.
2,A disappointment,"As a songwriter, Webb is a gem. As a solo artist, he leaves much to be desired. He plays piano well enough to gather in an additional star, but his vocals are wooden and without the pathos and love others have brought to their renditions of his songs. Webb writes beautifully. All he needs for that is the piano, a sheet or two of paper, and a pencil. He does not need to be recorded. Give this a pass."
1,"If you like the songs, stay away from this recording!","I feel bad being negative about this CD, but it really [stinks]. I love the Glen Campbell versions of ""Galveston"" and ""Wichita Lineman"" and was hoping this recording would add something to those songs, being interpreted by the songwriter, but it's a big disapointment. If this had been recorded when the songs were written (late 1960's, early 70's) instead of 1996 with it's over-slick produced KURZWEIL digital piano sound (YUCK!), I think this would have been much better and timeless recording. Instead, it sounds like bad SMOOTH JAZZ. I just hate it. I should have ran when I saw the names Marc Cohn and Michael McDonald associated with this. Ouch! I'm sure if these songs had been released for the first time in 1996 (like this), that Jimmy Webb would not have been the influencial artists he is. Stick with the famous recordings from the time they were written. They add far more to the craft and poetry of these songs than this CD."
5,Wasail Guy,"This guy is simply the greatest composer of the last 30 years. I watched him at the piano when we were both in our late teens, writing most of this stuff. He was always at the piano, while everyone else was on their way home or whatever. This was 1966 in San Bernardino California. Yes! Jimmy, we always think of you. Wayne Stauble, Toronto. Former student SBVC>"
5,ten easy pieces,Wonderful music its great to hear the songs as the writer sings them instead of all the studio over dubbing.
5,Maui memories,"I can't wait until summer, when I can see and smell this Plumeria in full bloom. I know that memories of Maui will fill my head whenever I walk by it. Alas, it's winter now and the plant is dormant. But it should start sprouting leaves and beautiful, fragrant flowers pretty soon.I could not be more pleased with the service I got from The Plumeria Gallery! Marlene is very happy to share her wealth of knowledge, and before my order arrived she had already provided all the tips I will need to get my Plumeria established and thriving."
5,A great book!,"I really liked this book.Written back in 1974, the plot is intriguing and still futurist, of course in an old-fashioned way, which makes it an unique book.I recommend this reading, especially to every sci-fi fan."
5,Alternitive worlds,"This is perhaps the most acesable example of Dick's obsesion with exploring the nature of reality and as such may well be a good place to begin a lifetime of reading obscure Science fiction.In this novel Dick explores meny of the themes that haunt his fiction (the nature of reality, identity, mental ilness and the death of the counter culture) in a form wich alows the reader in rather than excluding them as with other works such as 'The Three stigmata...'"
2,Very strange book,"The first book I've ever read by Phillip K Dick, although I've seen a bunch of movies based on his books (Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly). The story starts off describing the life of a major celebrity and his lifestyle - casual sex partners from Hollywood hills, romps in Venice, drug indulgences and plenty of crazy, surrealistic living - before his life becomes surrealistic itself. He manages to cope with a descent into anonymity and all sorts of quirky escape-the-cops-with-the-weird-stranger-who-just-befriended-you action in it that we've now gotten used to. Yeah, right.At the end, there's an odd, cowardly encounter with the policeman of the title, and then some sort of crazy ""ten years after, this is where the story's proponents ended up"" sort of thing."
2,Generic sci-fi novel with no character,"Flow My Tears, this is how I felt after completing this novel. The book was dry, and boring. It was a complete failure compared to Dicks other works. The characters were barely described and the plot was resolved all too quickly in the end."
3,perfectperfectperfect...and then it all comes apart.,"Classic Philip K. Dick through and through...and then you get to the ending. I suppose I've probably read a dozen or so PKD novels, and I must say none had a weaker, more anti-climactical ending than this. I must say, it really did feel like a cop-out. The majority of the novel is wonderful, but if Dick had just spent a little more time crafting a proper conclusion, the book as a whole would have been much, much better. I suppose my favourite PKD to date is probably The Game-Players of Titan...or maybe Now Wait for Last Year...or UBIK...oh, forget it. I can't decide. Just read 'em all, but you'd probably be best-advised not to start with Flow My Tears."
2,Omg,"This is silly beyond belief, poorly written, and crowded with cardboard dialogue mass produced in the sixties. I couldn't put it down."
5,"""Science-fiction with a broken heart, &amp; a tear in its eye.""","Written straight from Philip K. Dick's broken and wandering heart, this is one of the genre's best, and saddest, books. Instead of clanking heavy-metal robotics, quantum theory, or brave new worlds, Dick offers up our future peopled by fragile humans, all looking for love. It is impossible to read this book, and not feel Phil's heart breaking as he wrote every beautiful word"
4,To those interested in Phillip K. Dick,"Flow my tears... is another great read for me, a self proclaimed Phil Dick fan, however I suggest to those who havent read him yet to start with another book. Maybe A Scanner Darkly, or The Phillip K. Dick Reader which is a collection of short stories, some of which have become major movies i.e. Total Recall, Paycheck, and Minority Report. Total recall is based on a short story called ""We Can Remember it For You Wholesale"""
3,A standard Dick work,"Owning almost all Dick books and a lot of short stories, i find this volume a standard one. It starts off alright but then lapses a bit, until halfway through the book it again becomes interesting. The plot is underexposed which is too bad because it's an interesting one (different worlds being perceived by our brain under the influence of some drug). I was hoping for some great ending but alas, a short epilogue is what we get. Read Ubik if you want really gripping stuff!"
2,Was the benefit worth the cost?,"The basic concept was interesting, and kept me reading to the end. But the most disturbing thing to me about Dick's dystopian world was the total amorality of his characters. Perhaps this was Dick's intent, but I don't have any indication of that. This leaves me asking, was the entertainment I derived from the basic plot worth the exposure to the underlying philosophy? (On another topic, is the benefit of Kindle Fire's auto correct worth the effort of changing Sick back to Dick 3 times?)"
2,A decent action story but goes nowhere.,"Taverner is not supposed to be likeable, he is an arrogant man thrown from his usual reality into one where he is no longer important or privileged, but he carries the story very well.The other characters are a strange mix, all broken in some way, and Taverner's journey shows us a violent and brutal world that isn't too hard to believe.The pace is good but the ending and the explanation it provides aren't, it is too simplistic and easy and the epilogue is a annoying.This more like a bad John Brunner story than something by Dick.A journey but lacking in the final destination."
2,interesting but painful read,"I find PKD's ideas fascinating, thought-provoking, ""far-out,"" you-name-it. He was clearly a cutting edge thinker. However, his writing here is so god-aweful, I could not summon the will power to slog through this book. The exposition was so heavy-handed and the dialogue so cheesy I had to stop. When he wrote of a Rolls Royce skyflyer(a rocket of some sort, apparently) that its engine ""idled throbbingly,"" I nearly flung the book (frustratedly?) across the room. I then picked up VALIS. So far, much better. I'm looking for a pun involving ""Dick"" and ""throbbingly"" but my kid is crying for dada. Help anyone?"
1,Sheesh,"I have to admit that it appears that Amazon reviews suffer from the same problem as performance appraisals - everyone is outstanding. Too often I find that a book has lots of five and four-star reviews, only to find that, once read, the book just wasn't very good. And this book is not just not very good, it's no good at all. The writing is just so amateurish, the plot, as one of the other reviews suggested, is way full of holes, the ending, trite and completely disappointing. The book is an interesting idea that died on the vine.So we have to understand that Dick was a little nutso to appreciate his work? Sorry. This may be a good example of therapy for a sick mind, but that doesn't make it a good book. Sheesh...To balance all of the five-star reviews that, I think, are way off base, I give it one star. Come to think of it, forget balancing the five-star reviews. This book deserves one star on the merits."
4,1st of his books I've read,I liked this book. It looks like I have found a new author to read. This book had some crazy ideas that got explored. I can't wait to see what some of his other books are like.
5,Great read,"This was my first PKD book, I've always loved movies based on his stories, but this book convinced me to read his other works"
5,"Poignant, weird, wonderful","""Flow my tears"" is a sad, moving, very personal story by one of the world's Science Fiction greats. It is an adventure, a love story and a Science Fiction tour de force. In one of his favourite themes Dick has taken an idea originated by the philosopher Kant, and expanded it into a story. Simplified Kant reasoned that an individual experiences two universes, the common one (Koinos Cosmos) and a personal one (Einos Cosmos). The common cosmos could be a sum of all personal cosmoses, plus reality. (Don't blame Kant for this, I'm oversimplifying.) Dick extrapolates from there: What if one person's cosmos is disproportionately influential in the perception of the common cosmos? and what if that person is insane? or on drugs? The universe could well become a very weird place. Dick's huge intellect, experiences with drugs (especially LSD) and often unhappy personal life come together to make a hugely involving novel which has to be counted among the very best of the genre."
4,A little more about possible universes,"This is a great book in the same way many of Dick's books are: the reader is placed in the neverending crossfire of ideas and plot twists, and when the end finally comes, all you can do is ask yourself: ""What happened?"" Not everyone likes that feeling, but I do, and Flow My Tears is a fine representation of all the things I mentioned. The basic idea is fascinating, and as always, Dick handles it well, giving the reader a feeling of satisfaction: my time was not wasted reading this."
4,Very engrossing and imaginative story,"This is the first novel I read of Dick's, and I must say I enjoyed it very much. I was very engrossed in it all the way to the end. I did, however, have mixed feelings about the way the novel ended -it felt like Dick resolved the plot a little too quickly, but the ending was good nonetheless. I would recommend this book to any sci-fi fan."
3,Almost in Tears,"PKD is definitely my favorite author; I have read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Ubik, A Maze of Death, Our Friends from Frolix 8, The Man in the High Castle, A Scanner Darkly, a collection of his short stories and this novel. Honestly, Flow My Tears was my least favorite PKD book because it didn't seem to ask any important metaphysical questions. However, the book was intended to be an absurdist novel, so it may appeal to a few."
4,Sister of the world.,This is a French-Canadian story of a fifteen-year-old girl and the journey of self-discovery as she travels through the wilderness in the early 1700s. Her grandmother expects her to behave like a proper French lady. Story conveys conflict between white invaders and native Indians. Interesting historical fiction.
4,Mac Users Take Note,"When I received the CD, it failed to work on my Mac, giving me an error message about a problem with Flash.I found Dennis Webb's helpful post here (""Good Tech Support""). The Amazon bot deleted the URL he probably posted, but if you do a search with a common search engine that begins with G and ends with E, for the words, ""Oxford University Press patch shorter oxford cd"" the place to go will be the first web site listed.Then go down to patch #8, and download it. That patch actually will download two patches: 3.0.2.1 (which you need to double click on first) and 3.0.2.2 (which you double click on after the previous one has installed).You will then find that your installation works!Thank you, Dennis Webb!"
2,The Downside,"The dictionary is great, perhaps the best downloadable dictionary I've ever seen. But since it is a very old version (1997), it has compatibility issues. For instance, it doesn't run on 64 bit Windows 7 operating system. So watch out."
4,Very pleased,"The two volumes arrived very promptly, and included the cd version, which I had not expected.I haven't ""finished"" reading the whole dictionary yet, but the type is clear and the spacing is good. The food definitions could be a bit fuller, such as porterhouse steak. Otherwise, I look forward to a lifetime of browsing."
5,Shorter Oxford English Dictionary: Sixth Edition,I received this in just a couple of days. It was packed beautifully and it's going to make a wonderful gift for my daughter. She has wanted one for awhile and we are giving this to her for a gift for getting her Master's Degree. I thought the price and shipping was very reasonable.
2,SLOOOWWWW!,"I replaced Version 1 [1997] of the Shorter Oxford with this looking for pronunciation [though I'd prefer American to British] and some added words. This delivered both, but at way to high a cost in usability. Version 1 popped up instantly. This Version took well over a minute to load in a brand new laptop. And that was with all the content installed on the C drive...much faster than CD-Rom access. I can't overemphasize how cludgy this thing is to work with. After a few days, I uninstalled and went back to Version 1. There are many online dictionaries like freedictionary.com that offer the newest definitions and pronunciations that can be used to adequately supplement the older version."
2,Sadly not a major update,"The Shorter OED is too Britocentric and does not cover North American English well. If you live in the US or Canada, the Merriam Webster is a much better work.Unlike the OED, specific dates are not given and only date ranges such as E17 (for early 17th century) are provided.The quotations are given haphazardly for some senses but not others and many words have no quotations at all. You might be better off getting the whole OED if you're interested in the history of words.If you already have the fourth or fifth edition, do not bother buying this sixth edition as sadly little has changed. Apparently, Oxford University Press is more interested in churning out editions in order to pad its bottom line but won't make the effort to truly update the dictionary."
1,tiny tiny print,"I was looking forward to receiving this dictionary but was in a state of shock when I opened it:The words are very bold and super easy to read. The definitions however are more than small. The print for the definitions is smaller than 2 milimeters, and some of the definitions and sentence examples are in a even smaller print -about one milimeter in size. The print of the definitions is also not very bold, so it doesn't really ""pop"" from the page. By comparison, the print of the definitions in my old (one volume) Webster New World Dictionary (Third college edition)is about 2 milimeters in seize, and it is in a very dark print. So it is much easier to read. It ""pops.""If you don't like super tiny print, you don't want to buy this dictionary."
3,"Great dictionary, double click issues",The SOED has been a great dictionary. However the double click option to look up words from other applications has stopped working twice now. I have had to re-install the cd-com to get it to work again.
1,The New SOED doesn't work within WordPerfect 8.0 or 7.0,"I got the SOED as a gift. It ran fine as a stand alone program. When I tried to install it to work as a macro within WordPerfect 7.0 it was not compatible. I sent an e-mail to the Oxford English Dictionary and they offered to ""post"" a diskette patch to me. Gee, why wasn't it included? I'd rather use the books instead of having to constantly cut out of WordPerfect 7.0."
3,Major imperfections with this dictionary's CD-ROM,"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary: Sixth Edition (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary)The CD cominig with this dictionary is not 100% usable in that the advanced search and find in entry boxes do not accept typing hyphen or apostrophe. Therefore we cannot search ""add-on"", for example, across the dictionary. Further, the software does not produce history of words already consulted."
1,Skip it,"As a neuropathology fellow I am in need of a good neuropath/neurorad review book. This is not it. The text is concise and to the point but lacks detail. The layout is also distracting at times. The histology photos are just awful. It is impossible to discern any cytologic detail. The colors are all off and have some strange yellow/orange hue. I wonder if the images were taken off a monitor as the pixel size is huge and there are lines running through some areas. Most of the radiographic photos are of OK quality, but suffer from grainy resolution. One major gap is the lack of any description of the various radiographic techniques and their uses. I had high expectations for this book but came away with no additional knowledge. If you are interested in this subject area I suggest Practical Review of Neuropathology by Fuller and Goodman. It's a great book appropriate for any level, med student or resident."
4,"4 out of 10 tracks, no bad!",Los Chachos were one of the influences for the 80's and 90's big buck groups. Original adaptations of the 60's Texas sound.
3,Nothing really new here,"This book didn't strike me as anything more than some rehashed biographies on writers about whom a great deal of information has already been published. It's like a Cliff's Notes version of the stories of these great writers. If you want to read this book, you would be well advised to check for its availability at your local library."
5,a definitive music history brilliant,a fantastic book of the history of music during a particular era a page turner could not put it down mesmerizing
5,Love this comp,My old band Boy Kicks Girl has a song here. Great comp that represents the diversity of music in the bay area. Get free music from Boy Kicks Girl at [....]
3,"This is not a review, but a question.......","I have heard ""Long Cool woman in a Black Dress""....who is singing this? Is it Creedence Clearwater Revival? And a lot of people are calling this song..""Long Cool Woman in a Red Dress""...is is very confusing when downloading songs and they have both the Hollies and CCR as the Artist singing this song. Any info on this would be greatly appreciated."
5,Great game book,"I have been waiting for this one. Finally I can put this into a game. The series is great and this book did a great job in keeping with the feel of it. Way to go Wizards! There are a couple of errors, hard to find stats, and they only mapped the main continent, but overall it's great!"
4,Good and well thought out,"I found this book a well thought out and put together one. Mind you I'm not a big fan of Mr Jordan's writing,but I do love his world and it translates so well into an RPG. This book would have gotten 5 stars from me but for a few small details,for example I'm not all that pleased with how EXP is award (with characters gaining an amount based on how long the adventure has taken),a lack of hard fast rules for channeling addiction,and a lack of many talents and weaves (which will most likely be put in a future supplement) but these are all minor problems that are easy to correct with a little fore-thought and work. I would most certainly recommand it to a fan of the series who loves RPG's without a doubt,and would still recommand it too those who don't like RJ's writing,but do like his world."
5,great program,"This is a great workout for older people and the ""non-addected-to-exercise."" Fairly gentle but effective. This is a great living-room workout I like to use when I don't feel like overdoing it, or haven't been feeling well. Well-presented and easy to follow, but, as I said, effective."
1,Rediculously written,"As an active falconer that takes a great interest in the use of golden eagles in the sport, I was looking forward to reading ""Bird of Jove"". However, it is distractingly romanticized and events are ridiculously portrayed. This is not what real falconry is like. For example, the eagle falconers of the east, whom Sam meets first in the book, supposedly ""starve"" their birds for ""weeks on end"", keep them ""creully"" hooded, only releasing them from their ""shackles"" to kill savagely. C'mon! I had to put down the book in disgust.If you would like an authentic idea of what eagle falconry is like, complete with excellent and engrossing story-telling, I would highly recommend Steve Bodio's book ""Eagle Dreams: Searching for Legends in Wild Mongolia"" or, for a more practical point of view, Martin Hollenshead's ""Hawking with Golden Eagles""."
3,"A ""Road Map"" for the trails","Loaded with information, this high quality waterproof map is probably the primary source of trail data for Baxter. The one criticism I have is that the contour lines are printed too lightly, reducing the value of this as a topographical map - my main reason for the purchase. I consider it as a good ""road map"" of the trails in Baxter Park, but the cheaply made map that is included with Stephen Clark's ""KATAHDIN: A Guide to Baxter State Park and Katahdin"" provides the well-defined contour lines that would have made this the perfect map."
5,Unforgettable,"A Craving is a deeply moving account of one woman's struggle with addiction and its inevitable consequences, not only to her and to all those around her. Polly's story is an outstanding tale of courage, one that vividly depicts her fight for recovery and survival. Beautifully written, Polly's journey not one you'll soon forget."
5,personal and rewarding,"[[ASIN:0440316995 Craving, A I''m very glad to see that A Craving has been republished. I read it many years ago and have never forgotten the impact it had on me.The story is about a woman who faced with her alcohol addiction struggled much of her younger years to win that battle, to develop further as an artist, to save her marriage - a heroic and courageous struggle, painful remissions in spite of good intentions. This is an intelligent woman whose demons dominated her life for so many years. One roots for her with each success; one cries with her for each failure. Even if the reader is not familiar with alcohol addiction, as I am not, the daily battle with habits that impede our growth, whatever their form, is not unfamiliar What is so invaluable about this novel is how deeply the pain of addiction is made clear.I was grateful that by the end of the book I knew she had had her final breakthrough and would hopefully go on to lead a fulfilling life."
5,Finally!,"Finally, someone wrote a book about freshman year of college that is worth reading. It really covers all angles from academics to partying to roommates, etc. But what really works are all the quotes and stories by actual students mixed in. Every high school senior should read this."
5,Helpful book for adjusting to college life,I bought this book for my college-bound son. He enjoyed it and said it provided helpful information on adjusting to college life and being out on his own. Purchased a second copy for a friend of his also attending college.
3,"Wounderful, but...","As you go trough the book you will discover some wonderful pictures, but that's it. Because the information that comes with the photos is very limited and in some cases inexistent, except for the name of the species, of course. Unless you are an ""advanced"" bonsaist, you better buy another book as this, only gives you lots of visual information, that beginners, as me, won't see at first glance. So, if you are a beginner, you better grab your hands on another book, but if you know enough, I would rate this book as four-five stars."
2,what kind of four seasons?,"If you think you are going to see pictures of the same bonsai in four different seasons do not buy this book. Except for one plant there is no such a thing. And it is a pity. The book has four different chapters, one for each season. But they do not repeat the same plants. That is to say that they just select good plants to be photographed in each season as most books do. Therefore one cannot see the richness of a bonsai throughout the year. The book is beautiful but if you want good pictures there are many other better books i.e. Classic Bonsai of Japan, also by Kodansha."
5,Great outdoor kids projects! Wish to contact author.,"Timothy Fisher's book ""Hammocks, Hassocks & Hideaways"", is a great out of print book. I picked it up at the library. I am currently making the Ferro-cement outdoor furniture in the shape of a llama. I would like to write to the author but cannot find an address online. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Meanwhile, if your have kids (even if you don't) and love to be creative with how much or how little space you have, check this one out!"
1,Terrible,I ordered online since it was unavailable locally. It smelled Rancid. As if I had been cooking with moldy grease. All in all a very horrible experience. I remember this in my younger years as sweet and fresh and clean. What I got was Nasty.
1,horrible/,"Purc in June 2011. Opened at time previous bottle was finished on Dec 27. It was horrible. Appears to have been old and turned to alcohol. Wrote to vendor through complaint system on Amazon. Doubt I will get a response from vendor, but at least I have satisfaction of warning others. I made this a one star, but really a zero.New - BLUE GRASS by Elizabeth Arden EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY 3.3 OZ - 119149"
5,First Rate Recording,A beautifully performed and recorded performance of some (new) material from Sibelius and some old and cherished as well.What a treat to hear the Karelia Suite with added material from the composer himself.Emotionally performed by an orchestra who's pride in their native composer shows.Honestly recorded with a natural hall perspective.Sibelius at it's best.
1,A Waste Of Money,"When I bought these cards, I really thought that I would be getting something that would genuinely help me study for the MCAT, but it turns out that I was terribly wrong. This is essentially a box of worthless definitions that can easily be taken from the Kaplan Prep book. Additionally, the cards rarely, if ever, explained/showed formulas. The size of the cards is also a downside. They are incredibly small and very easy to misplace. All in all, I have glanced at them and decided that they simply are not worth the trouble. So take my advice, and don't waste your $50."
4,Wonderful study aids!,"For the price, these saved me the hastle of making the notecards myself, and while yes they are basic, its really nice to have hundreds of definitions in the palm of your hand."
3,mcat flashcards,"when I bought these cards, the description was pretty brief - if it had said that the cards mainly were definitions, I probably wouldn't have bought them. but it didn't, and I did. they're ok but not exactly what I was expecting - I was expecting cards with questions, not just definitions. I'll use 'em anyway, just probably not as much as I would use other types of cards"
3,Tarzan starring Jock Mahoney and Woody Strode,"I remembered this one from my childhood and wanted to see it again as I remember liking it quite a bit. Video quality was only fair but I enjoyed it and was not disappointed. Woody Strode is interesting as the bad guy and Mahoney is a different kind of Tarzan but it works. The end challenge race and fight scene was what I had really wanted to see. Enjoyed it and am tempted to get Mahoney in ""Tarzan Goes to India""."
5,unbelieveable,this was really great and the movie was pretty as well where it was filmed i mean the acting was good and at a great price as well and worked like reported to and i liked the price as well. thank you virginia
5,We love this Video,I bought this for my husband who uses much of the music in one of his classes. We are both very happy with and love it; however we wish it was on CD
5,Not Only Fun But Inspiring,I really enjoy this program. I only wish it was on DVD. This video of President Hinckley's 90th birthday celebration I liked so much that I looked for it on Amazon. VHS is the only way it's available and I don't have a vcr but have got to get a dual player now as I've been planning on doing. Amazon continues to provide a valuable service when people need to find excellent but nearly obsolete products.
5,Heaven in a bathtub,"I love this stuff. I have sensitivity to some bath products, like bubble bath, but this product has never irritated my skin. It smells amazing and is so relaxing and refreshing. After a bath in this, your skin is soft and rejuvenated. It's like a spa at home."
4,"Very soothing, peaceful","I love this product. Good quality from a trustedBrand. If you enjoy soothing soaks without overpowering perfumy scents, this is for you. I typically love light florals for baths, but decided a change of pace was in order! Rest has been escaping me of late, so the peaceful chamomile proved to provide what I was looking for."
4,Rollergirls,Overall this is a good dvd. You will fall in love with some of the girls and hate others. Hades Lady is a real coniving b**ch. There are some good interviews with some of the girls that are uncensored but I am greatly dissapointed that the shows are censored just like the A&E shows. Middle fingers are blurred out and the language is bleeped as well. I like uncensored content on my dvds. This one did not deliver. Booo to A&E for issueing a dvd with some parts uncensored and others not.
3,Could be Useful,"This book seems to consist of two things, inspirational quotes from various sources and a giant advertisement for visiting a psychologist or psychiatrist. If you know of someone who you think needs professional help but isn't getting any, it would be worthwhile to buy this book as a gift. It may be just what they need to motivate them into seeking help. At the very least, it would show your concern for them. On the other hand, if you suffer from depression yourself and are already in therapy, this book is completely useless to you and will depress you further if you spend hard-earned money on it."
2,"Well, they tried.","This book was too simple. It didn't look at the hard facts. It didn't address the real issues. I felt that it was wishy-washy. It only discouraged me more, since I did not see the immediate results that they claimed would happen."
1,I can't believe I spent money on this...,"Great book, excellent book...if you're not seriously depressed. Full of inspiring quotes and motivational words, able to heal those with SHORT term depression in a single bound. For those with chronic depression? Well, it's the same old rehash of everything we already knew before. You know, the stuff that didn't work last time..."
1,How to heal depression,Was recommended by the therapist i am seeing. When reading the book it made me more depressed. Maybe that is how they are making their money?
5,CCNA Study guide,"Brilliant book, I passed CCNA exam yesterday with a 924 score first time, tried other books but Todds was the most readable as if he was actually talking to you, and the best explanation ever on subnetting, even though I read it over a few times, but I felt comfortable during the exam. I liked Todds sense of humour. The test questions at the end of each chapter, plus the test exam were realistic to the real exam, 2 CCNP books already on order by Todd of course!"
4,Please note the Dates of the reviews.,"The current test is 640-606 which came out in the first of 2002. This book is only been out sense September 20, 2002. Only one review is of the current edition. The old editions are very poor study guides. However, the current editions of the books are more in line with the test. As for the two new exams that I have taken, I found the Sybex as good as if not better than the Cisco.The best options for the CCNP tests are to get both Sybex and the Cisco. Note however, that the Cisco books for this test (Support) and Remote Access and are for the old exams! Also Cisco books are poorly written and are full of errors and the Sybex will compliment the poor Cisco books"
3,Sybex should have a second edition of this book,"This book doesn't provide an overview of the interfaces of Catalyst 5000 series which is covered mostly in the exam (Supervisor Engine, LED's, etc.). This is too wordy also, but doesn't provide you on how to interpret the output of the debug commands in IP and IPX protocol which is also covered mostly in the exam. To pass the CCNP 640-506 exam, you need not only this book but a full hands-on on Catalyst 5000 series of switches."
2,A good read but not what you need.,"Just took the CCNP Support exam and did not pass. I based my whole preparation on this book and its exam prep software. I read the book twice and went over problem areas on a nightly basis. I was scoring 100% on the sybex edge test prep. Was confident of at least passing. The information in the book did not match up with the exam. Frankly, this book came up short. Though I failed by a calculated two questions, I can say practical job experience contributed more than this book. Things were worded in Cisconese and seemed to be centered around that company's learning objectives with no deviation. The main commands taught in this book were scarcely referred to by any of the test questions.In conclusion, I would recommend obtaining training materials from Cisco. If they are not available, wait."
2,Disappointed with this particular Sybex book,"I have used Sybex for the routing/switching and remote access exam and passed the respective exams. But this book on the other hand was lacking some of the information on various categories of the official exam. Today I have purchased the official Cisco press book for this exam, which I will likely do for now on in the future. For now I have to pay for this exam AGAIN, this was the first I have failed. Good Luck!"
3,not good enough,Not a very helpful book for CIT 2.0 exam. Cisco Troubleshooting book is much better for CCNP exam.
1,Same book as CIT just different name.,I was dissapointed when I went cover to cover and realized I bought the same book again. Don't let it happen to you. You'd think something changed. The CD is the only thing that was different. If you have the CIT from the same source don't waste your money.
5,Amazing Book,This book is a suspenseful and exciting easy read with its many twists and turns. It makes me understand how people of its generation lived without movies or television. Southworth has the power to captivate readers and bring them into the world she creates. I would recommend this book to anyone.
5,I love it Leon is the greatest,I have been trying to locate this cd in Nashville and the stores are so crazy they do not have it. Leon is the greatest
1,Defective. Dead after 3 charges.,"CHarger died after a few batteries were charged.Maybe I just got a lemon from the factory. Dunno. Did everythingaccording to the book, and the POS died on me."
1,Beware,This film is painfully bad. Juvenile and pathetic. How this made it on Amazon is a conspiracy. I want my money back. I demand my money back
5,More than Pretty Camera Sweeps...,"Many travelogue videos suffer from the ""disembodied narrator droning on about scenery and landmarks"" syndrome. Not the ""Lonely Planet"" series. This one is one of the best... traveller Justine Shapiro takes you along on her personal explorations of Ecuador, interacting with people, asking questions, and taking some risks. That's the real strength of this video (and most in the series): they emphasize people and their ways of life over scenery, and make you feel like you aretaking the trip yourself, not just watching continuous camera sweeps. Very well done and highly recommended for school use!"
2,Don't like it.,"It doesn't seem to be accurate no matter what stride I set it at. So I just keep it at the default stride of 2.5 and base my number of steps on that stride. I also have a problem keeping it level on my waistline. I don't always have a belt on so on those days I just don't wear it. Also for [this price] I thought I would get more features than it gives. It doesn't count calories, there's no memory in it, and the auto stride adjustment doesn't seem to work too well. I'm in the process of looking for another one even if I have to pay more money. I guess you get what you pay for!"
3,I ain't lyin'!,"A Christmas album by Rudy Ray Moore? Yes, it is. The CD opens with the only song on the album, which is the R&B classic ""Merry Christmas Baby"". Rudy does a good job with the vocals (he was an R&B singer before he was a comedian). This is a decent version of the song. The rest of the album consists of Rudy's raunchy comedy routines. The best routine here is ""Night Before Christmas (Part 1)"", which is a hilariously filthy version of the well known poem. The rest of the material is somewhat uneven, and it should be noted that many of the jokes have nothing to do with Christmas. I also should mention that the sound quality of the CD is not that great. It sounds like it was copied off of an old LP that has a few scratches on it. But Rudy Ray Moore fans will still dig it."
1,HORRIBLE SHADE - NUDE,I purchased both the Revlon lipliner in NUDE the Revlon #070 NUDE Lipstick.Both are aweful. Don;t waste you good money on the Nude SHADES.
4,A Decent Product,"I purchased this trimmer to keep my goatee in line, and it does quite well. I've had no snags at all in 4 months of use. The longest trimming setting, #4, is a little shorter than I would have preferred, but hair does grow, after all. With the cover off, it does quite well as an edger, for lack of a better word. Trimming a moustache right under the nose is a little tricky, but can be pulled off if you are patient. All in all, a solid little product."
2,Not my type of romance,"There are a few things that bothered me personally about this romance. First, I do not consider bigamy romantic at all as Wakwa has two wives. I believe true love is with one person. I don't think most readers are going to find the leading man sleeping in the bed with two women and going back and forth between the two romantic. It feels rather degrading towards women in that respect whether the main character is indian or not. It certainly wouldn't be my fantasy! Second, this book had an uncomplete ending. It never really went on into a epiloque of what happened to the lead characters. This series really should have had a third book to rap up the ending. The ending in this one could have been alot better."
4,Big Brother Rocks,"Great CD. Very good recording and the mix is very good and even. As good as Cheap thrills, with new songs and guitar riffs."
4,Live Janis,"This is really good Janis with Big Brother. When they worked together, it was really amazing. Janis and the band in fine form."
5,Janis on the jazz,"I'm a fan of early Janis -- there's a raw power that got buffed a bit too highly later on. This is a stunning album, with everything she and Big Brother did best -- and that's saying something. Big Brother never quite got the credit they deserved -- there's a raw power here that makes up for any lack of finesse & polish, & is a perfect complement to Janis' heart and soul. Later stuff is fine, too, but this will burn a hole through your heart. (It does offer new takes on tunes already available on the Cheap Thrills and BB & THC albums. If you have a problem with listening to two masterpieces, this might not be your best investment.)"
4,"Better than IN CONCERT, but rips you off in 3 ways!","Get this CD instead of IN CONCERT, for one thing! Sure, Full Tilt Boogie's good, but the Big Brother here is far superior to the one in IN CONCERT. Secondly, ""Bye Bye Baby"" is from IN CONCERT, ""Ball and Chain"" is on CHEAP THRILLS, and ""Farewell Song"" is from FAREWELL SONG, so don't expect new exciting versions of those songs, they're the same old ones. But, still great! Don't pass this up! Maybe this is a sign the Joplin family will start releasing Janis on a regular basis! Keep your fingers crossed! :-)"
4,Pretty Good,"I love Janis, so I'm not going to talk trash about her cause she doesn't deserve it at all. Her voice and singing style is so cool and anyone who disses her doesn't know true 60's blues very well(in my opinion). I have this cd, and it's okay, I like my cheap thrills cd better though. But if you want a good live album of janis, get this one. It does have good classics on it and I like big brother and the holding company. So, if you're a Janis fan like me, you should probably get this cd"
3,"FINE, BUT WHAT ABOUT RECENT WORK BY THE BAND?","This is a fine and predictable release. What is sad is that there is no record of the great stuff that Big Brother did with Michelle Bastian over the last ten years, or now with Lisa Battle. Michelle Bastian's voice is truly wondrous. I am one of the few that believed that the band behind Janis was a lot more important than her, and still do. Big Brother is currently touring all over the United States and Canada. Tune in to their web site - just jump to Big Brother. But this is a good introduction for those that weren't there. I was, and this recording does bring back a lot of memories."
3,Marginal at best,I had a hard time finishing following this plot to the end. Didn't find the usual entertainment value that I generally find with the APO series from other authors.
4,cozy but footbed needs help,"These slippers are great - very soft and cozy, but the innersole came loose after only wearing it for a few hours, then got scrunched up under my toes. It was easy to fix - just a little household glue put them back in place.They don't come in half sizes, so rather than order a size UP, I ordered a size DOWN - I generally get a better fit that way - but because of this, the back of the shoes always folds down and now it pretty much stays that way. All in all, though, I love these slippers, and I'd buy another pair in a heartbeat when these wear out."
1,terrible terrible!,These slippers are not a bargain. They fall apart within a few months and then you need to buy another pair again. Don't buy 'em. They're junk.
1,bad quality materials in these slippers,"I was so happy to have some new warm slippers! Sadly, they didn't even last for two months of gentle use! The soles are falling off and I have rubber bits all over the house. The slippers are already in the trash can. Don't waste your money on these."
2,No Arch Support!,"I bought these slippers because the description specified arch support but in fact the slippers have none. In the photo, the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area, however, this turns out to be only a styling effect where the sole wraps the upper -- there's no structure under it at all. The quality of the slipper's upper is lower than expected, it appears to be entirely sythetic despite the description of ""wool-blend"". Also, one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after I put my foot in the slipper the first time. The rubber sole is substantial, though heavier than I like to wear in a slipper. All in all, I regret spending the money on these."
3,Almost a Great Slipper!,"I think I've had these slippers for about three months, and for comfort, they're great. I like the thick sole; I like the warmth; I like the fit. My only problem with this brand is that within the first month the lining in one of the slippers began to peel loose starting at the toe, way inside the slipper. I had to wait for this bond breaking process to reach the arch so I could pull it back,sploosh some fabric glue on it, and reattach it. For that reason, I now wear socks with these slipper (though one slipper doesn't have that problem), and wearing socks with slippers isn't my idea of happiness. I don't know if I'd buy another pair of these for that reason."
2,Very disappointing,I ordered a size 6. The outside of the box said size 6. The slippersINSIDE were size 11 and full of cat hair. I am allergic to cats.The soles are black recycled rubber from china and make markson the floor. The soles also stink. I sent them back and will notbe ordering anymore slippers. It's not possible to know what theyare like until they arrive--then its too late.
1,slippers,"I bought these slippers in December 2007 and brought them back to NZ . I am very disappointed they have fallen to pieces, the soles have cracked and lumps of rubber fall off when wearing them. This is after 6 months of wearing.July 2008"
5,At last I found them!,"I have been wearing these slippers, everyday, for 3 years! They are a blessing for my cold feet! Not to mention the durability. I just now realized the sole was broken almost in 1/2 from years of use. I was frantic when I looked and looked and could not find them.Today is my lucky day, I just ordered my second pair!"
1,Disposable slippers,"Within a month of purchasing these slippers the black rubber bottom began to chip and fall off. I will never buy them again, nor would I recommend them to anyone."
1,Awful quality,"In the 6 months that I have owned these slippers they have completely fallen apart. The rubber sole has split along the seam and cracked in other locations. Plus, they arrived with a horrible baby powder/chemical perfume like smell that took forever to fade. I was looking for a replacement slipper for my J.Crew wool clogs that were 16 years old and the wool had just started to get holes....I certainly did not find a good replacement."
2,So Fake!!,"I tottaly agree with a reader from usa. In this book, Ashleigh made out that jumping is soooo easy. Is that ever WRONG!!! Jumping is really hard and takes a lot of work. No one can ""just do it"" like the authour made out in this book. It took me months to perfect a two foot jump, and Ashleigh can do it in a few minutes? I don't think so. It's not like running a horse fast is any harder, that's for sure!!"
5,The Ashliegh Books Rule!,"Joanna is a great auther, but I was wandering why another auther is writing some of her books? Even in the Thoroughbred books another auther is writing them. I can't wait till all the other books come out. It is so exiting to read about them. I can't put the ___Joanna Campbell___ books down."
4,Great Shaving System...but it's no Mach III,"The Norelco 6735XB Advantage Rechargeable Cordless Wet / Dry Shaving System was in my GoldBox, so it was REAL hard to pass up. I did not have real high hopes for the razor because of the Mach III. I have to admit, it is a great razor for everyday shaving. You can use it in the shower and the mirror that comes with it is awesome! You just stick it on the shower wall and your set. The ""goo"" that comes out does a good job for moving the razor around. You get a close shave, but it's not as close as a blade. Also you don't want to use this thing if you have not shaved for more than two days. It's worth the money and it's great to keep in the shower. My best suggestion is to use it only in the shower. If you have time and money, use the Mach III. You will get a closer, more comfortable shave. I think it is a good complement to the Mach III."
4,"Good shaver for the head, and the gel makes it smooth.","I shave my head, and don't like using a razor blade. Though I've been using a fairly new Norelco shaver, the model 7866XL, it wasn't leaving my head quite smooth enough. When I read about this shaver that works wet or dry and dispenses shaving gel, I thought I might as well give it a try. I like the results; it cuts more closely and finally gives me the look I want. The ""steam-free"" mirror is a joke though. I put it up in the shower and it immediately clouded up. It is useless."
4,used but very good,"Songs are great, its very old worship songs, but you can still praise God and worship him with this music. I don't think God's music ever goes out of style. Service was great, it did not take a long time to get to me."
5,Works for me,"This product has been working for me and if it works, dont change it. I have had a cholesterol problem in the past so along with watching more carefully what I eat, drinking plenty of water, exercising more and taking this has lowered my trigliceroids, raised my good cholesterol and lowered my bad cholesterol. I recommend that you at least look at this product and consider it."
4,very impressive!,"I have been taking lipidshield for three months now. My bad cholestrol hasdropped 20 points in three months while taking two pills a day. I now take just one pill a day for substanance. I have high blood pressure and I noticed that I cannot take lipidshield and drink caffein for it raises my pressure, I believe it is the guggulipid in it . I used another product first that had guggul and I had to discontinue it completely. All in all I am very impressed with lipidshield.CJ"
3,"Very soft, but they shed a lot...","I received these as a gift recently. As the title notes (and other reviews on the smaller size towels attest), these shed quite a bit. I expected a lot of lint in the dryer filter (and there was), but I actually had to empty my washer drum of towel fabric as well, as a decent sized handful came off the first time through the washer.The bath sheet size is very large and is great for the beach or spa, you can really envelop yourself in these. Overall a nice towel if they hold up, but probably not worth $20 each."
2,BOO Thumbs Down,"I am usually very happy with Hilfiger Home products. Well, these towels are run of the mill discount linen store quality. There is nothing luxurious about them whatsoever. I would expect to pay around 10 bucks for each. They ARE NOT worth it...I don't know what the heck kind of towels some of the other reviewers were using before they bought these!!!"
2,Sheds like a hairy dog,"10+ washes and these towels are still shedding, like little dust balls everywhere. Overall they're OK."
2,Poor quality,I have had these for 6 months now and they are falling apart. Forget about the lint... they don't last! I had Kmart towels for 6 years and they didn't look this bad!
3,It's not what's on the picture,"I got it thinking they were the hole package but it's only one towel, careful"
3,Needs Improvements,"Tried trail ver of product and was dissapointed. For [an expensive] Windows based program it was lacking. Navigation through it's modules was confusing, I was interested in it for a construction business but the ID numbering system (8 char),and component description (20 char) were very limiting. There was a ""component type"" that could be used for listing Phases, Master, or Subcomponents but you can not assign a subcomponent to a Master or Phase. There is also a cost type where you can assign labor, material, etc. Mutiuser capability is very good in that you can limit access to certain areas to users. For the money Peachtree Complete Account is better buy at [less money]. It has a 20 char. ID limit and 30 char description limit and is very easy to navigate and understand."
3,Greenleaf Cinnamon Room Spray,"It's a sweet smelling cinnamon. Not bad but I was looking for a room spray that smells like the cinnamon pine cones that I buy every year, stronger and not quite so sweet."
1,Poorly scanned facsimile,"University of Michigan press did a slothful job of scanning this. Many of the recto pages have the right edge of text cut off, leaving lines indecipherable in many cases. Find a better reprint or facsimile of this. This is obviously their attempt at making some extra funds from a cheaply and carelessly produced book. I returned mine the next day in the same box in which it arrived."
5,Sweatshirt bought on Amazon,"Product was as advertised, new and first run. Item was shipped and received as indicated on the website. Will use this seller again for similar or other clothing items."
1,"Mmhmm, rather boring","It's OK for the first 2 minutes, after which it's repetitive and very boring. Yeah, they explain the special CGI effects, yeah the actors had to act when doing the dialogue, etc..... However, this review shouldn't be taken as critical of the movie itself, which I recommend. I watched in 3D on IMAX screen and it was great."
3,Avatar,"A short take on the creation of Avatar which was interesting and not very long. The use of live actors who were digitally changed into tall, small waisted aliens was a special technique."
2,Sci fi fan,It was OK but really over rated by almost everyone. It was ok but nothing we have not seen before. I might have squeezed out a 3 star but I was not really impressed with it . If your looking for a cute movie for the kids then its ok . Otherwise if your just a Sci Fi fan you might want to pass unless you like little kid stories . It tries hard at times but falls short of being taken serious !
3,Not so good,"Bad picture quality, hardly worth watching. Interesting material spoiled with poor picture quality not quite sure what was wrong. Should be in HD for this type of material."
2,When I don't pay attention to detail I get Avatar,When I d/l this app I thought I was actually d/l the movie. I didn't pay attention to details and got an Avatar that was -to me- useless. I will pay more attention next time.Knight68
2,Blahhh!,"I had some high hopes for this one. Some actors were good, some were just horrible. really low budget, which would be ok, if the director could make up for it, but he did not. Generally weak. Anyone who wants a sequel to this probably shouldn't watch these types of movies (Didn't you watch the end?) If you want super depressing movie, but in a good way (which is what they were going for) get ""Requiem for a dream"" or the ""nameless"". Don't bother with this one."
2,NO,THIS MOVIE WAS COMPLETELY HARD TO FOLLOW. MADE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. I WONDER ABOUT THESE REVIEWS ON HERE SOMETIMES. WOW.
5,Good Book!,I thought this was a great book and I look forward to reading the rest of the Jeff Resnick books.
4,Good reading,This book holds your interest and is easy to follow with a lot of twist and turns in the story. Enjoyable reading.
4,Great Read,"I found this title just by searching around the suggestions. Glad I did; I ended up enjoying this small novel, and it prompted me to read more of the series."
3,Entertaining,"While this book is entertaining and I will read the series following this to see how it transpires, this character is not too believable. He does really stupid things and puts people's lives in danger. Good that it is cheap and I am always looking for cheap books to spend the day with."
3,Pretty good,Liked the character of Jeff...story line goodHuh Hugh inhibiting. TTchvjnijihyfub. Gvyfydyvininij up in c. F f. Chubb fvccch v. Uh
3,MURDER OF THE MIND,GOOD READ NOT EXCELLENT. I READ ALOT AND AT SOME POINT PREDICATABLE BUT GOOD. WOULD READ ANOTHER JUST TO SEE IF BETTER.
2,Don't hate the protagonist!,"Those are basic rules to a successful novel. I understand the injury...I'm even okay with ""gift"" that ensued. What pissed me off was this guy feeling he had the right to badger/antagonize people because of a premonition. An UN-qualified ""Columbo."" To insult me even further was how forthright suspects were with divulging information. Just a head-scratcher.The saving grace to this novel were Jeff's relationship(s). Whether brother, girlfriend etc. All beautiful, all endearing. Only thing that kept me reading, got this story 2-stars. I'd read future stories just for character development."
3,It was your average run of the mill mystery.,"The story did not contain many surprises, but the characters were interesting. I would consider reading other books by this author."
3,Interesting plot,"Received it through kindle instantly. The premise of the plot was plausible, and a little different. Will continue to read and follow Jeff Resnicks adventures. Reading on my iPad works great but hard to read in bed. Don't want to drop and break the iPad. At least with a paperback you don't break anything or hit yourself in the head. Owww!"
5,Enjoyed,A good read. Keeps you wanting more. I will look forward to reading more books by L. L. Bartlett soon.
4,Reading in Bed,Good light reading for bedtime. Bought a Kindle paperwhite to read in bed and this was one of my first books. It was fun and relaxing. Some of my favorite authors are too heavy for bedtime. I read and then lie there and ponder. Like Resnick's theme and hero and have just downloaded another book in the series. This is the first and a good place to start.
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!,"Good read, kept me guessing what's going to happen next. Definitely would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good suspense book!!"
3,Really Good,"Kept me guessing, and I usually get bored easily! I would def recommend this book to anyone, I couldn't put it down."
4,Murder on the mind,I found the story intriguing and well plotted. Once I started reading I didn't want to put it down until I finished.
3,Murder on the Mind,I enjoyed the book enough to look into the series and read a preview of the next book in line Dead in Red which sounded interesting and I will be reading it soon.
4,Exceptionally Good,"This was exceptionally good. A victim of a random mugging, Jeff Resnick suffers brain damage and to recuperate has to move to Buffalo NY to live with his much older half-brother. As he recovers, he and his brother have to work on establishing a relationship they'd never quite been able to grasp in the past.Jeff comes across as real, as does his physical ailments and relapses. Emotionally, however, he's even more of a wreck as he experiences strong feelings of fear, terror, anger and vengeance. The emotions knock him for a loop and he becomes convinced that they're connected to a murder. I had a problem accepting the identity of the killer and the circumstances of how the murder happened, but otherwise the narration is tight, never lags, and neither did my interest.This book was the first L.L. Bartlett I've read and I'll be looking for more by this author. And I was glad to note that this was the first in a series featuring Jeff Resnick and am already looking to the next one."
4,Decent book,I enjoyed this book. It was a quick read but nonetheless a good read. If you like murder/mystery you will like this book.
4,Great Story,From the moment I started reading I was hooked! I can't wait to read the next story in the series.
5,great read,"bartlett is now on my 'must buy' list! i have read several of this author's books, and they were all great!"
4,Unusual mystery,"I enjoyed the psychic aspect of this story. It gave it a different dimension. Good read. Will look for more from this author.., I'm"
2,Murder on the mind....2 1/2 stars,"Never read anything by this author before, but a good read. Although you had a sense of what was going to happen you still felt compelled to keep reading. The characters and the relationships kept you curious."
3,Murder on the Mind,I found this to be a bit infantile. Nice for easy light reading. It certainly didn't keep you hooked & turning pages.
4,Loved it,"A great read. Definitively get this one! The story keeps moving...I really enjoyed the relationship between Jeff (the main character) and his brother, Richard."
4,Good & fast paced!,"My first time reading this author, but not my last. I look forward to reading others in this series! Enjoy!"
3,Was a different spin,Was a different spin on the normal mystery plot. Used the psychic bit just enough....too much would have killed the affect of the book.
4,held my interest,if you like those who done it type of books this book would be one of them really enjoyed reading it!
4,This will keep you wondering!,"I am an avid mystery/suspense reader. This was exciting, the plot great and .........please read it for yourself. You will be caught top."
5,I love mind trips - in fiction,"I've owned Murder on the Mind for some time (bought it as soon as I spotted the intriguing title and clever cover design) and now wish I'd gotten to read this murder mystery sooner, because I enjoyed it. The pace moves effectively (no wasted words) and the characters are believable -- with or without Jeff's psychic ability, which creates exciting situations. Above all I loved being able to fully identify with the central character and take on his motivation and complex relationship with his brother as if these were my own motivations and my own complex sibling relationship. LLBartlett really nailed Jeff's feelings and developed a most interesting plot. Well done!Chris Roerdenauthor of Agatha winner Don't Murder Your Mystery"
4,A good read,A nice change of pace from your usual murder mystery. Written with a nice pace that holds your attention yet laced with enough unknown lighter moments to make the book enjoyable.
3,not bad,"I thought this book was pretty good. I liked the writing style and the characters were down to earth and believable. I appreciated the subtle complexity of the relationships between the main characters, which was developed in such a way that it added a little bit of drama, but was still relatable. The only thing that I didn't love about this book was, well, the premise. I feel like the whole idea of the protagonist having ""visions"" to help solve a crime is both a little overdone and is somewhat of a cop out. The plot was entirely propelled by the main character having aptly timed visions that spelled out all the necessary clues needed that (surprise!) the cops don't take seriously. I feel that the book might have been better if the author had taken the time to tie up loose ends at the end, including what happened to the kid, why he had a connection with the kid, etc. However, overall I thought that the book was well written and I enjoyed the characters immensely."
3,Actually 3 1/2 Stars,"Murder on The Mind was a decent mystery to read. I actually read it in less then 3 days so it kept me reading to find out more. I gave it 3 stars but it probably deserves the 3 1/2 stars which is an option I did not have. It was a solid mystery, nothing spectacular but a good read. You wouldn't go wrong to read it."
4,"Good thriller, keeps you guessing till the end",Easy read and easy to understand right up to the gripping finale. I will be looking out for the next book.
5,Murder on the Mind - worth a read,A well written mystery with plenty of twists and turns. The story starts of at a normal pace which speeds up about a third in. I stopped doing other things to keep reading this. The main character has visions that turn out to be true. I'll definitely be reading more from this writer.Olga
4,Interesting murder twist,First time I read a book by this author. I like mysteries and this one had an interesting twist. I thought it was a fast read and kept my interest.
4,Good book!,"This is the first of a series of 4 (so far) Jeff Resnick Mystery books. I saw that the Kindle edition was free and it had a ton of 5 star reviews, so I decided to give it a read. Despite all the great reviews I honestly didn't have great expectations for Murder on the Mind, but I was pleasantly surprised. I quickly got sucked in, and now about 10 days later, I'm in the middle of the third book in the series. Other reviewers have already laid out the plot and other details so I'll just add my voice to the many that think this is an excellent book. My only tiny complaint is the endings are a bit abrupt, however that is the author's style; and to tell the truth I probably feel this way because I've become attached to the characters and story line and I hate when it ends! Recommended!"
4,Great Psychic Mystery!,"I really enjoyed this psychic mystery! Interesting how the protagonist uses his new psychic ability to solve a heinous murder, as were his relationships with the other characters. Good book, and I already got the next one in the series!"
3,OK for free,"The book suffers from lack of strong editing, lots of redundancies and overwriting. But the plot is good enough to keep the reader from abandoning ship. I encourage the writer to keep at it. She shows good potential and with the right help, could develop into a strong author."
4,Good read!,I really enjoyed reading this book. It held my interest and I finished it in a day. I think you will enjoy it too.
3,Entertaining,Enjoyed the characters and story...a good read.I want to read more about Jeff and his mental abilities and watch the growth of his relationship with his brother.
4,"Creative approach, quick read","Jeff Resnick is a good central character and the idea of an investigator with mental powers is neat. The killer is broadcast early, and the climax is a bit far-fetched but not too much to take away the enjoyment."
4,good read,Excellent book if you like a good mystery.....kept me interesteddidn't want to put it down. will definitely read more by this author.
3,Could have gone there,Overall the book has a great read.I personally felt as though it has a slow start in the beginning. I couldn't quite grasp what the first few paragraphs were about; first he was at the bar the in the snow hunting. Eventually I realized that the italics were the dream and I began to understand.At times the reading became mundane because of unnecessary descriptions.The book is worth the read for the main character Jeff Resnick.
3,A good read.,Entertaining. It was a quick easy read. The characters were interesting. I will be reading another Bartlett's books in the future.
3,Enjoyable,Would like to have read more about his abilities and more info on the woman from the bakery! Enjoyed it though very much.
4,Well written,"Recommend to anyone who enjoys suspense, romance, and humor. Well written and easy to follow the story line. Kudos to the author."
4,Good,"Pretty good for a free book enjoyed reading it,hard to put down.would recommend it to others to read.short book thou"
4,I enjoyed Murder on the Mind,The story line kept me engaged. I found myself looking forward to completing the book. You will likely enjoy as well.
5,Murder mystery,I loved this book so much that I found another one by the same author and have already started reading it.
4,Murder on the mind,"A very good page turning, keep u at the edge of your seat book. The author lets get to know the characters well."
4,Very Good!,This book was a very good read. I liked the main characters of the book and the psychic twist. I am looking forward to the next book.
4,Murder on the mind,Good book. Never knew what to expect next. Not too many characters to keep tract of. Will read the next Resnick mystery.
4,Murder on the mind,Good title for book about psychic abilities. Good development of characters as well as plot. Enjoyed the details of Buffalo. New York. Grew up in a similar area and could relate which made the story more realistic. Recommend this book.
5,Very good storyline,Got this book as a free download. After reading it I feel that I should have paid for it.The story just seemed to hold me to it until the end.I will definitely look for other listings by Ms. Bartlett
2,Very elementary read,"I was excited to read this based on all the glowing reviews. I was not impressed.There was really no plot twist, no drama, no ""who done it"" and for it to be a book about a ""psychic"" there was very little psychic insight--I feel that should have been farther developed.The writing was basic, the plot was basic, the ending was basic and I would skip this if I were you."
5,Great Book!!,I really enjoyed this book!! Kept you interested and on th eedge of your seat!! Want to read the whole series now!!
2,Foul language,"I like to read clean books. As soon as I saw the foul language appear in this book, I quit reading."
3,Okay novel,Well written first novel in a series. I may or may not read more from this series. Character development was good and the story is woven together with loose ends tied up at the end.
3,Interesting Read,"The plot was good and the story keeps you interested. Unfortunately the killer was pretty obvious, but the book was well written. I recommend it for an enjoyable read."
4,murder on the mind,enjoyed the book (murder on the mind)an easy & quick read with some good & interesting twists - plan on reading the follow up but already have other books I have downloaded
5,WOWWWWWW!,"Great book, edge of your seat compelling read!!! Loved the entire book, cannot find one thing I did not like. Will be checking out more of L.L. Bartlett books especially the Jeff Resnick series."
4,interesting,A very interesting book. A very different approach to solving murder. I am curious if he has a series with this character.
3,Very good read but ending was lacking,I was intrigued through this entire book. Kept me very entertained but f err my the climax and ending could've been better.
4,Murder on the mind review,Very good. It always kept you wanting to read more. I would recommend the book to family and friends. And I will read more books from this author.
3,Murder On The Mind (A Jeff Resnick Mystery) L.L. Bartlett.,"It was not bad reading.I unfortunately do not often read this kind of story so did not find it as fascinating as some of my regular reading, I do like biographies or non- fictionIt also is something to read while travelling, pick up and read and you will not have forgotten what the story is about.about."
4,Murder on The Mind,It kept my interest but was disappointed that there were missing small words and typos. Someone did not proof the copy very well.
5,First Jeff Resnick mystery a success!,"For anyone who loves a different type of mystery, this one has heart! Can't wait to read the next one!"
5,Murder in The Mind,I loved this book..Great story line..couldn't put it down....Anyone who loves a good murder mystery must read this!!!!A must read!!!!!!!
5,Murder on the Mind by L.L. Bartlett,"Awesome book. The first in a phenomenal series. It is the first look into the life of Jeffrey Resnick who unwittingly gets pulled into a life of crime solving due to a traumatic experience. Jeff is an average guy, trying to live an average life. That all changes with a mugging that changed his life forever. Using his skills as an insurance investigator and a brother who's always there for him, he enters a life he never expected. Once estranged from his half brother, these events bring them closer together in a way he didn't anticipate. The Jeffrey Resnick novels are a joy to read. Easy to relate to the characters. Plot line easy to follow. I've enjoyed reading the entire series - two times. Well worth the time. You won't be sorry!"
5,Great beginning,"The Jeff Resnick series is a bit different from the author's Booktown cozy mysteries (written as Lorna Barrett); however, the premise intrigued me, and I wanted to check them out. I have had Murder on the Mind in my TBR pile for awhile and finally got a chance to read it. I couldn't put it down, and finished it in one sitting. I won't detail the plot or characters, as a lot of other people have already included that in their reviews. I can say, however, that I was so impressed with the writing style and character development, that I was anxious to read more. I immediately ordered all of the other books in the series (including the shorts). I am now part way through Book #2 - Dead in Red - and have not been disappointed. This is a great series and I look forward to reading the other books in the series."
4,Quick reading,First book I have read in a long time. Grabbed my interest right off the bat. Makes me want to get back into reading. Going to read more of this series for sure.
4,Murder on The Mind,"Hard to put down. Very fast reading. If you like mysteries, you will enjoy this book....Murder on The Mind...I plan on reading more by Jeff Resnick..."
4,good mystery,I would recommend this book it is the first novel I have read by LL Bartlett and it was good - an interesting read - liked the character Jeff - but the millionaire brother is a bit over the top.
3,paranormal bent,"Now, Jeff is haunted by unexplained visions of a heinous crime—a banker, stalked, killed, and eviscerated like a ten-point buck. When Matt Sumner’s murder is discovered, a still-recovering Jeff realizes this was what he had seen. Jeff must not only convince himself of his new-found psychic ability, but also his skeptical brother Richard Alpert. Since Sumner was Richard’s banker, both brothers have a stake in finding out what happened. With Richard’s reluctant help, Jeff’s investigation leads him to Sumner’s belligerent family and hard-nosed business associates, none of whom want him snooping around.When Jeff discovers a second victim, he knows he must relentlessly chase his quarry even if it means risking his brother’s life.Everytime I think I want to like this series we have the maudling whining about putting the brother in jeopardy. The brother is nosy and bossy but supportive...he is an adult quit taking all the blame Jeff"
3,Murder on the Mind,I had never read this author before and I was pleasantly surprised. the story was well written and kept me interested throughout the book
5,Murder on The Mind,I had never read this author before and I was pleasantly surprised. the story was well written and kept me interested throughout the book.
4,Interesting book from an accomplished author.,A good read and the price was right (free). I would probably like to explore a different book in the future other than a Jeff Resnick mystery from this author and see how it compares.
4,Murdernon the Mind by L. L. Basrylett,"Unusual story. Fast moving and interesting. Many twists and turns. Leaves you wanting to find out more about the characters. Enjoyed this book a great deal would recommend it, if you like a good who done it."
3,Murder on the Mind,This was the first L.L. Bartlett book that I've read. It was a quick and easy read with an interesting story line. It will be fun to read other books to see how Jeff continues to deal with his new found ability.
3,It was an OK story. It's ending was as expected. I probably would not get another of her writings.,"There was nothing outstanding. It was a good story, comfortable to read with nothing complex. I probably was not look for another of her writings."
4,Quick read,First book I've read by this author and I was pleasantly surprised. It had a nice pace and unexpected twists. Definitely worth purchasing!
3,"Quick, Easy and Interesting","This was a quick and easy read that featured a pretty interesting story line. This was the first L.L. Bartlett book that I've read, and I'll look to pickup another one to give it a shot."
5,Great read,I really enjoyed this book so now I am going to purchase the next one. Great mystery which I like.
3,It was okay.,"For the price (free) it was good. That said, if I'd paid anything for this book I'd been very disappointed. The concept was well thought through, but the on-page execution of that concept could have been better delivered.I know this was the first book of a series so a lot of backstory had to be explained, but the pacing suffered for it. Also, in an effort to garner reader sympathy, the main character came across borderline depressing.I want to give this author another chance to wow me. (The writing itself was very good.) I just don't know if I'm willing to shell out $$$ to do so."
5,Excellent,I love suspense. And psychics novels can't wait to read more his books. This was the first time I heard of this author he's great!
3,Storey line keeps you reading.,I liked the characters and became attached to them causing me to read the next novel in line. You cannot help getting attached to Jeff's brother Rich.
3,Good read,Interesting book..... read it in only a couple of days because I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to more of these books
1,wait... what?,"I am really into mystery / crime books, and this was the first book I read on my new kindle app on my nexus 7! I was so excited to start reading this and in the beginning, it had so much potential... until all suspense was lost because the main character can basically figure out everything and there were no surprises whatsoever in the book... well maybe in the end a bit... but hey, where was the suspense?! maybe the people who gave the book 5 stars liked everything being revealed before it actually happened, but common, at least try to keep me on the edge of my seat a bit please! I had no problem putting down the book... I read the Lightning Thief after this and even though it was written for the age group of 12-15, I had more fun reading that than Murder on The Mind"
4,Good read,"This was my second Kindle purchase and I was happy with the story. It was a entertaining read, but it was a bit slow. There was not much action until later in the story. I think that this book was a good start for the character which this author is going to make several books about. I will probably read the next story about the main character because of reading this first book. He introduced a romantic interest, but it quickly dissipated which I was a bit disappointed about."
3,SO-SO,"It was kind of predictable, and it jumped topics quite a bit, and it was of slow to get to the point"
4,Compelling,This was a spell written book.it had suspense and depth.hard to stop and wanted to read more.Will read another by her.
5,Very entertaining. Excellent read.,"This was a well written book that drew me in before I completed the first chapter. It's easy to immediately connect with the main character, Jeff. I didn't put it down until I had finished the whole book. Just enough excitement and wonder to keep you turning page after page. Very excited to continue reading the series and getting to know Jeff Resnick a little better. Definitely worth the download and for the price you can't beat it!"
3,book,The book was ok. I thought it would be longer. 78 pages was short and thought it kept jumping around
3,Not as bad as some,I enjoyed reading this book but probably wouldn't go hunting for too many about this character. I got a little tired of him in the end.
3,Feels a little outdated,"I found this book easy to read with relatively good character development. However, it fails to bring something new to the table and all in all sounds like many others that we have read before...."
4,Murder on the Mind,"I must admit I was apprehensive about the storyline, but once I got into it, I tried to get back to it asap."
5,Another Grest L L Bartlett Mystery,"Character development is such that you get to feel like you truly know these returning characters. Jeff, his brother and his wife, Brenda are so believable, when you're done reading, you almost wonder what they're doing when you close the book. Just wish she would add to this series. Highly recommend this book and entire series."
2,Glad that it was free,"This was a free book on my Kindle and I'm glad that I didn't have to pay anything. If I had one word to describe this book it would be - BORING! We were already told who the killer was pretty early on, so what was the point in continuing to read the book? If I'm reading a mystery novel I want there to be suspense until the very end. Once the main character revealed the killer, I just didn't want to read any further. It also didn't seem very realistic that so many people were willing to give Jeff confidential information and even invite this stranger into their homes! Sorry, but I would not recommend this book."
2,DULL AND BORING,"I have never had more trouble reading a book as I have with this book. This book put me to sleep more times than a sleeping pill. If there was humor in it, I never found it. The main character is as boring as a piece of dried toast and his brother isn't any better. I just felt that the book dragged on and the chapters are very long."
4,Good Mystery,I enjoyed reading this book. It was a real mystery right till the end. Worth reading.I would give it a try.
3,Easy read,"The characters were interesting and it was a well thought out story. Ended abruptly but besides that compliant, it was a good read."
4,Like this author,First time I read this author. Book the other books I could find under this name and other open names on wish list
5,I`'ve been hooked!!,Good story well written - I`m in for the series!! I was delighted to find out there were several more to look forward to!!
4,My first L.L. Bartlett book,"Enjoyed this book very much. Story was interesting, characters felt real. Fun and easy read. I recommend you read it."
4,Murder on the mind-short,This was a great book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely a page turner and great for reading on a plane or when you have time to spare.
4,Skeptics will enjoy this!,"I don't usually enjoy reading books on the paranormal, but L.L. Bartlett writes in such a way that skeptics like me could actually believe this story. I also enjoyed the minor stories that run along with the main plot. The characters and stories are well developed to keep you engrossed. Great mystery / thriller that doesn't leave you asking why, instead it leaves you wanting the next book by this author.I read this book in one day and enjoyed each and every page. I would highly recommend this book as a good read - especially if you manage to get it free from the Kindles bestsellers list!"
4,Easy enjoyable read,I enjoyed this book. Predictable plot but liked the characters. Easy fast read. Looking forward to reading more in the series.
2,Murder on The Mind,"Never got it on my kindle. It was supposed to be down loaded but wasn't, along with another book I ordered."
1,Disappointing,I don't read books with cuss words as I tend to spit out of my mouth what I put into my mind. I'm sure it would have been a great read but had to delete it from my kindle library.
1,murder on the mind,"Also never received this. Thinking of returning my kindle fire. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I don't think so. It is supposed to be eary and Im supposed to love my kindle. So far, no"
3,A good read,This is the first book I've read by L.L. Bartlett. I enjoyed this book and swill definitely read other books by this author.
4,A nice mystery,This book was amazing. It only took me three days to read it. Jeff and his brother Rich reminded me of myself and sister. From the beginning it draws you in and keeps you interested until the end. The only dislike is I questioned whether Jeff had this power before the attack. But if you love mysteries this one is good for you.
2,Simplistic and one dimensional,"I can not figure out why this book has so many glowing reviews. I'm an avid reader and read around six books a month while commuting and I bought this on my Kindle because there were so many 4 and 5 star reviews. I guess if you like books with no depth, little character development and hardly any suspense this is for you. I prefer a rich story, intricate details and characters I love by continuing to learn about and grow with in a series. This was not it. I much prefer Louise Penny's mystery novels. So much more rewarding."
4,Murder on the Mind,"I enjoyed this well written mystery with a touch of the paranormal and the setting is very well described, although bleak and cold. worth a read."
1,Snoozer,"This book is very slow. I'll admit, I didnt even finish it. I made it into the third chapter but I was so bored, I discarded it completely."
4,A detective story without a detective,Interesting concepts in this book and one that makes you wonder if these things can happen. Can we be connected to the real world through our minds in other ways? This touches on several aspects of live from mental health through to criminal investigations and all through the eyes of someone who has both. I thought the book was interesting and stepped through the plot lines well. I read this in 2 sittings with a comfy chair and a nice glass of my favourite drink. I recommend it and will look to get more of the Jeff Resnick Mysteries.
4,Good book,I liked this book. It was a good read over several lunch hours. It gave enough backgound information on the characters and left me wanting to know what happens next in their world.
4,Good Quick read,"This was a great read, for a relaxing afternoon. I actually bought another one of his books to read, which I Plan to do this weekend."
4,Medium or large,"A fairly good read with likeable characters. Don't know if ""mediums"" are legitimate or not, but I'm looking forward to more Jeff Resnik."
4,Interesting,"I enjoyed this book. I`m not terribly interested in a psychic story, but this one was very enjoyable. I would have given it a better rating, but for the language. There was too many vulgar words. So for parents, you might want to think twice before letting the kids read it."
3,A slow read,Took time to get into it. Once I did it was good but predictable. Don't think I'll read the sequel.
5,I highly recommend,This was the first book I read by LL Bartlett and I really enjoyed it. Can't wait to read more by her.
4,Murder on the mind,Started slow but got better after a few chapters and then grabbed your attention and hung on until the exciting end
5,Great Read,Murder on The Mind was an outstanding book. Jeff Resnick is a terrific character and I could not put the book down.
5,Murder on the mind,"The book was an easy read, easy characters to follow. Good twists but not complicated. Will look for others by the author"
5,likes,"I really like reading this author. It is not often one finds a new author that is captivating and fun to read, just by chance."
3,OK,This book was enjoyable so I ordered Dead in Red the next book. Will not purchase another of this author's books.
1,"If you want something useful, look elsewhere","This book-and-cassette package is a disappointment. The emphasis is on certain set phrases -- ""Where is the bathroom?"" ""Everything is so interesting!"", with weak coverage of grammar. The tapes feature an English phrase, followed by the Italian translation (repeated after a pause).In the ""section"" on occupations, we are told how to identify ourselves as either a businessman or a lawyer. That breadth of coverage gives a pretty good idea of the value of this book. Save your money."
5,"Script for ""The Women""","I am the member of a play group which has monthly meetings revirewing the author and the play chosen. I didn't have ""The Women"" in my library. Was disappointed with the lack of material on the author, but since it is a play script I expected it and found enough material on the internet."
4,The Women,"I thought I was getting a novel-like book; instead this was a script. It was interesting to read this format as it gives a lot of details about how the author wants from the characters, etc."
2,the missing link,It works.this is the fifth one bought though dont ne one make stuff that last any more i need a belt drive i guess
1,Not pleased with book,"I purchased this book because we are planning a family trip to Yellowstone and Jackson Hole this summer and I was extremely disappointed. There is no map inside, (to show you where these places are), there are descriptions of hikes and cool things to see, but there is no ranking on how difficult it is or for what age group, there are no tips for activities for children at all. In fact, I think this was a guide book NOT written for families and the publisher just put that title on the book to sell more copies! Buy something else if you really have a family and are taking them to Yellowstone."
3,nice but not perfect,"This is a nice,comfortable muddler. The rubber tip makes it easy on the glassware but doesn't give you the real ""grinding"" power others might provide. It does fine with mint leaves but anything harder than that would be difficult."
3,"Good item, good selection, good quality",It is engraved well and is a marvellous selection. I have remained very consent to the product.
3,Good if you'd like a quick read,"This book is a quick read. It glosses over concepts that are covered in greater detail in ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie. If you are looking for the fast read, this is your book. If you are serious about improving work relationships, I'd have to recommend Carnegie's book instead."
5,Child Friendly!,My children have always loved this CD! My daughter took it to school to help entertain the preschool class and someone took it. She was heart broken. I was thankful to find it again! We play it each year as we decorate the Christmas tree!
5,Arrived Quickly!,I ordered three of these since it was so cheap and free shipping!I used it at work as a gag on one of the boses and it was the funniest thing ever.Worth it!Thank you!
1,Biscuit Cutters,"I bake bread every week and I needed a product to help me keep all my bread in a uniform shape. I find that this product was too small, so I returned the item."
4,Fine,"This review refers to the original text. The book did not live up to its appealing title and is over rated. While it ranks as one of the best volumes in the set, it ranks among the worst of the early volumes. There is actually one criminal Carl Schaum, captured on page 59. Outside of the brothers going through the caves during the middle chapters the book was rather medicore. The revision (1964) was horrible. Still the book is a definite read as are all the early volumes."
3,Starts Strong/Peters Out,"As usual, the H. Boys take every opportunity to ""out-brain"" everyone in the room, and it is simply a joy for the reader. I really don't know how they do it. Those young men are sharp.For Example (and don't worry, I won't ruin the book for you):In chapter 16, ""The Gerbil, Unaware"", I thought the entire pet shop sequence was simply a tool to provide some comic relief following Dick's maming. I had no idea those furry rascals would play such an integral role in solving the mystery.And who knew Johnny Nitro moonlighted as a PVC salesman?!"
3,If it wasn't for those meddling Kids!,"A 2007 Summer Reading List Mini ReviewI never realized before how much the Scooby Doo cartoon series is indebted to the Hardy Boys and other teenage mystery series of that genre. We have a group of teeneage kids, who stumble into mysteries. The scoobies have the mystery mobile. The Hardy's have thir car and their boat aptly named ""the sleuth."" Scooby Doo seems to be a Hardy boys adventure played for laughs. The capture baddies in this book even bemoan their fate on p.169 stating ""If they hadn't come snooping-"". Sounds familiar?I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane back to Bayport and those meddling kids."
2,What Was The Author Thinking?,"This review concerns the revised 1964 edition. A young girl asks Mr. Hardy, Frank and Joe to find her brother, a young university professor, who recently disappeared. A clue left by the professor leads Frank, Joe, Chet and Biff to the Honeycomb Caves, not far from Bayport, where the boys discover a connection to Mr Hardy's other case involving sabotage at a new radar station in Bayport. I don't know what the author of the revised edition was thinking; he/she took the original edition, that was already not very good, largely rewrote it, stripped away the only really good thing about the original (its rich language and descriptiveness) and made an already dull book even worse. This is a bad book with a boring mystery and not much action. If you're determined to read this title, read the original if you can, neither one is very good, but at least the original was well written."
5,The Secret of the Caves,I sent this book to my grandson in Scotland for his eighth birthday. He is thrilled!
4,Music for Musicians,This most definitely is not an album you'd want to sit an listen to. It's not even background music. It's one and ONLY purpose is to provide musicians with a set of free for use breakbeat loops and vocal samples. So if you're a musican who's into Fatboy's funky flair this is an excellent tool box! But don't expect anything more.
1,Awful!,"I bought this cd thinking that I would get an interesting look at the early works of Fatboy Slim aka Norman Cook. But what I heard greatly disappointed me... either they took his worst old songs or he didn't get good till he got signed. Each song follows this basic pattern, some with very slight modifications: A vocal or sound effect will play, then a loop, usually just of a beat, will play, and it will repeat over and over again with no changes at all for the entirety of the song. Don't buy this album, it's a total waste of time."
4,Great product for after shower,"This is a really good lotion, particularly body lotion. As for hands, well, you might try something else like Gold bond lotion. However, for right after a shower, this product works very well on sensitive, dry skin and helps hold in moisture throughout the day during the winter. I've been using this for years and highly recommend it!"
1,Be careful if you have allergies,"I work in a hospital and must wash my hands many times a day, which leaves them dry, itchy, cracked and bleeding. However, I have very sensitive skin that reacts to many topical allergens and lotions. I have previously used the Vaseline Intensive Rescue Healing Hand Cream with great success, but it is no longer carried by my local provider so I tried the Moisture Locking Lotion today. The first time I applied it the backs of my hands almost immediately broke out in a painful itchy rash. I thought that might have been a fluke so I waited for the rash to clear up and tried again about six hours later. Within 30 seconds I again broke out in a rash, even more painful this time. I will be taking this back to the store tomorrow and ordering the Healing Hand Cream online. This may be great for those with normal skin, but if you have very sensitive skin don't let the ""hypoallergenic"" fool you."
3,Not what I expected,I am not very pleased w/ my purchase. I do not get as close of a shave as I thought I would. I have always trusted Norelco... and now I am not so sure.
2,It broke after 3 uses,I like the shaver. It's a pretty good one and I was happy initiallyuntil it broke. The customer service guys were pretty good but it would take a month till they replace it. It was a pain and I wouldn't recommend it.
5,The Best by Far,"I've used electric shavers for about 8 years now - this is by far the best. Light years better than Remington, for example, my last shaver. Sure, it needs care (discharging and recharging fully every 4 weeks,) but doesn't everything of value and good quality require care?"
3,Not the best,I was already using an older Phillips electric shaver which works better than this one. It takes me longer and it's not as precise. Not thrilled with my purchase.
3,Decent shave but impossible to clean,"I only used this to shave my legs, and it did a decent job, although I had to go over places a few times. However, while trying to remove the head to clean it I broke it. Thinking I was a klutz, I bought another one, tried to follow the directions and broke that razor, too. Off to buy a different brand. Good luck to those who try to clean this razor."
3,More Liars Than Saints,"Although I appreciated Meloy's writing style in places, as a whole her cool style may have contributed to a sense of detachment I felt in reading this book. I simply didn't care much about the characters. I saw Margot as a contradictory character--I wanted to empathize with her but didn't. I didn't see Clarissa's relationship with Henry deteriorate--just got the divorce. So many characters were caricatures (Mr Tucker and his granddaughter) or partial sketches (the Jesuit and Margot's husband). I am not writing off Meloy, however, because she's clearly got stories to tell and her writing has promise."
2,big disappointment,"I was recommended this book and read it during a long flight. I found the characters to be sadly underdeveloped and did not feel that the growth of each characters was visible so by the end I didn't care about any of the family members. The end was a bit too dramatic and seemed like a ""Lifetime"" TV plot. The writing was good and so maybe the author's next attempt will show some maturity."
4,Growing Up Catholic OR Growing Up With Family Secrets,"I think the title of this book could easily be changed to 'Growing Up Catholic' and/or 'Growing Up With Family Secrets'. I imagined the matriarch of the story as actress, Imelda Staunton (she was Academy Award nominated for the film VERA DRAKE in 2004). The story moved along so quickly that the first chapter had the matriarch married as a young girl, the second chapter had her with two young daughters and the third chapter had one of the daughters impregnated by a schoolteacher during a school dance outing. The chapters get more steamy as one reads along. I must thank my dentist friend, Jane Carter, in Surrey, England who recommended the book. I truly got a lot out of the book. It's clearly true that 'a family is irrevocably changed with each additional child' as is mentioned in the book."
1,Interesting with no meat,"I read this book in one day. Not because it was so good I couldn't put it down, but because there was not much to read. Although it has an interesting and complicated plot, the characters are dreadfully underdeveloped and stagnant while the author's voice lacks compassion. The characters found themselves in precarious situations resulting in scandalous consequences, but I found myself unable to care. While reading, I was wanting to know more, but by the end, I could care less what happened. If you are looking for a book to pass the time on a rainy Saturday, this is the book for you. If you are looking for literary heft, look elsewhere. Try ""The Curious Incident of a dog in the Nightime"" by Mark Haddon. He has written a character you will truly care about."
1,Nothing Special,"I found it impossible to get involved with the two-dimensional characters. This book went, unfinished, back to the library. I'm glad I didn't buy it."
1,Predictable and Underdeveloped Story,"Was sent this book by a friend who thought the subject was sad and depressing. I was disappointed in this book. I read the first reviews out, and thought it would be a good story and a good read. I was the one sad and depressed reading this story because of a shallow plot, predictable story, and underdeveloped characterzation. Maile Meloy has more talent then this book tells."
2,Terrible,"I thoroughly hate this book. I'm not even very sure what it's supposed to be about, but the plot includes a housewife in the 50s who has an affair, someone getting pregnant, people sleeping with those they shouldn't, people dying. (A vague summary; I'm trying not to reveal spoilers here.) It's a thoroughly depressing, deflating, and pointless book, filled with tragedies and depravity. The writing style isn't particularly sophisticated.What this book has to offer, I really cannot figure out."
1,A Disappointment,"I bought this book excpecting something very different from what I got. It is not just a story of how a family is affected by Catholic guilt, but Catholic guilt topped off with some incest and a vengful God."
2,"Promising writer, not yet a novelist",Four generations of a family in only 250 pages just doesn't work. The characters and the plot had tremendous but unrealized potential; the author just didn't flesh them out enough to make you care. I was sorry that I started the book. There were points to admire but they were completely overwhelmed and negated by the missed opportunities. This writer hasn't arrived yet and your time would be better spent elsewhere.
3,Just a long short story,"I bought this book as a light read while I was on vacation. The reviews were all good and the story line sounded interesting. However, to me this book was somewhat disappointing. I felt this was just a long short story, with too many characters left un or under-developed. That said, I do believe the writer is good and can engage the reader and did so in many parts of this novel (hence the 3 stars) but should have either shortened the time span of the story or added another 100 pages. Good first novel -- hope the author continues to build her novel skills with future works."
4,It's more than a story of a catholic family,"Yes, the book is written in a simple, straight forward manner, but the ideas and thoughts and character are extremely deep. The facts could have been of a family of any religion and anywhere in the world. It is definitely a thought provoking work and should be required reading in every high school."
4,Written by a Scholar of the Sikh Faith,Dr Mansukhani's is a Gur-Sikh and this book is written with a lot of devotion. His understanding of the Guru's teachings helps us understand a lot about kirtan and the relative role of the raga.
1,Overpriced/Under-researched,"If you like pictures of pipe tomahawks and Indians this is a book for you. If you want to learn about them go somewhere else. Most of the information (which is slim like the book) is unsubstantiated in any way or referenced in any way. We are left to accept the authors opinions without further questions. Many mistakes of fact multiply the questionable opinions expressed. This book does little if anything to add to the knowledge of Pipe Tomahawks except giving the Dealer's slant on the business of buying and selling. The author attempts to rate them and date them using his own system which is not truly based on fact, but on opinion. Books like this perpetuate inaccuracy to the point of ridiculousness. But if you like only photos of pipe tomahawks, this is the book for you. Otherwise, I recommend Russel and Peterson and Neuman."
5,MIDNIGHT STARR!! MIDNIGHT STARR!!! MIDNIGHT STARR!!!!,"This is a absolutely fabulous album I would truly and most definitely reccommend this album the vocals are so wonderful they are nice and clear and the voices and the words sound so good my favorite tracks are electricity, feels so good, no parking on the dance floor and many others I love this album I also reccommend the anniversarry collection it is awesome I bought it for my mom !!!!"
4,A classic 80's R&B assembly of electric funk and soul,"If you're an 'old school' fan, this is a must for your collection. Some electric funk, (Electricity and No Parking on the Dance Floor) and the classic 'Slow Jam' make this a fabulous album.This album probably defined the early 80's for me more than any other. 'We are... Midnight Starr... We gonna show ya how ta do it... Yes we are'. If you like to 'Smurf' then this one is a must"
5,Less Dentists Please,"The Interplak has kept me from having a continuous stream of small fillings for years. Works very well. They do not last long, but they are cheap. Don't even bother with the warranty, they will charge you as much as a new one when you consider freight."
2,Interplak,It replaced an Interplak Plaque Remover and it does not work half as well as my old one. I have even gone to the Interplak website but oculd not find a way to email my comments.
3,Good Product Except for Short Battery Life,"I've had good results with this brush (my dentist is impressed by how little plaque I have), but I can't keep it charged anymore. When it was new, I could get 4 or 5 brushings between charge cycles. After about 6 months it could only do 2 brushings. Now (about 2 years later) I have to keep the charger plugged in all the time for just one use. The original Interplak had great performance and lasted much longer."
5,I prefer Interplak...,"I have used an Interplak toothbrush since they first came avaiable many years ago. I prefer Interplak's brushing motion over other brands; it reaches more areas of the teeth more easily. What's more, it's cheaper to buy to startInterplak NT7CS Triple Action Power Plaque Removerand replacement brushes are cheaper than other brands. SJG-N.J."
5,Excellent product,I have used several different electrical tooth brushes but always return to this model with independently moving brushes.
1,Interplak Splatter-matic,Shoots toothpaste and mouthwash all over the bathroom through openings located lower on the brush. Comes with a note that customers also bought a Conair Interplak Replacement Heads Bonus Pack that doesn't fit the brush.
4,Don't buy the pkg deal (brush and replacement heads),"I like the toothbrush, it feels like it is definitely doing a better job than my previous electric toothbrush.I had read other reviews that mentioned the replacement heads that came with the pkg deal didn't fit, but I fig'd surely Amazon straightened that out. WRONG! Having to return things is such a hassle!"
5,Plaque buster it is!!!,This is the best toothbrush I ever owned. I have it for over a year now (I wait to write my reviews) and it is awesome. When you 1st switch from a regular toothbrush you may experience some bleeding. That's normal. But then your gums get STRONG! And you teeth are clean and it's like using dental floss while brushing! Just make sure you buy the right replacement heads. No big deal. A++++++++++++++++++++
1,Old Interplak much better,"I had purchased an Interplak toothbrush in the early 90's. While using it, I had dental assistants remark how little plaque I had, even after two years one time when I was lazy and didn't visit the dentist. That Interplak was an amazing toothbrush and the battery in the unit held out for close to ten years. I bought another Interplak after Conair purchased the company and it wasn't even in the same ballpark as the old one. The battery wore out after about nine months and the soft, silky brushing of the old Interplak was never there. I suppose the problem with the old Interplak was that they were so good they rarely wore out and how can a company survive if people don't recycle their old products for new? I've discarded the Conair Interplak for a Braun which is okay but not even close to the original Interplak purchased in 1990."
3,"Works very well, wears out too fast","I have used these for years, but the quality of manufacture is deteriorating. My last one died after a year, which was a warrentee replacement for one that lasted a few months. It cleans teeth very well, however, so I'll keep getting them, I guess."
4,"Good Product, Bad Manufacturing Quality","I have used the Interplak/Waterpik electric tooth brush for many years. It does an excellent job of teeth cleaning, better than any of the others. However, their quality control in the manufacturing process leave something to be desired. My first Waterpik (now Interplak) lasted several years, though I had to send it back for repair twice. When it finally croaked, my wife and I purchased two of these a couple of years ago. Within 6 months both failed to hold a charge. Interplak replaced them, free (except for postage in returning the failed units). The new unit for my wife lasted just over a year and then failed to charge at all. She bought a new one. In spite of the endurance problem, it is still the best and cheapest on the market."
5,Interplak,"It seems to be a great electric toothbrush. I gave it as a gift, it came just in time for Christmas, and I was told it works nicely. It arrived when specified and was well packed in the box."
2,ok,"Its aight. Some soundtracks are way better than the anime, but def not this time. This soundtrack kinda sucks. And i hate to admit that because this is my second favorite anime behind Berserk.Maybe I will understand the soundtrack more when i see more episodes; i've only seen what was previously shown in america."

3,van morrison/ joe cocker,This is not the format I was expecting. Lyrics included but printed on paper.I will look closer next time to see cd+g Shipped in alright time frame.
5,Richter at his best,"I cannot put into words how impressed I am with this recording. Beethoven only got better with age, and--although it is hard to improve on the Appassionata or Hammerklavier--these last three sonatas are as good as anything he created. They are not very much alike, except that they begin with something simple and progress up and up and up until they reach a sort of transcendence. Richter's interpretations are very powerful. I have recordings of the same works by Schnabel and Pollini -- Pollini's version is a bit colorless when contrasted with this recording; Schnabel's is the reference edition, but Richter compares to it favorably. The works by Brahms and Chopin are as well-played as the sonatas; sound quality is excellent. The price seems a bit high, but this is worth it. (The perfect supplement to this CD is a Praga disk with Richter's performances of Beethoven's sonatas 27, 28, and 29.)"
1,"LOOKS CUTE, I KNOW...","BUT this cheapy Emerson Spongebob CD Player has NO shuffle function and it WILL NOT play CDRs!AND BUYERS BEWARE! Do not buy from Seller Jordysmom. This seller sent me this CD boombox UNWRAPPED in a huge, empty box; needless to say, the player was DID NOT PLAY CDS (don't know if it was flawed or broken). Took forever to get her address so I could send it back (and I had to pay return shipping!) When she FINALLY did refund me, she sent me a nasty note saying that the CD player wasn't broken & that I'd commited ""mail fraud"" sending it back to her via media mail! THE GALL!Look Elsewhere. I bought the Sony CFD-S350 CD/Cassette Portable Boombox (Silver) off Amazon for $30 and it has a shuffle mode and is sturdy and has anti-skip technology."
4,Robert Utley produces another thoughtful biography,"The master of the western biography has written (and added to the original version) a balanced reporting of the events that happened that day in June. The oversize pages allow for splendid photographic illustrations. All the versions as to what actually took place are presented thoughtfully and a case presented for the most logical conclusion. I had read his later book(s) including ""The Lance and the Shield"" about Sitting Bull, before discovering this one. It was also very interesting to find out what happened later to some of the people involved."
5,Excellent Book!,"I think this book was very well written and showcases pre and post revolution Iran with great clarity. Once taken up for reading, putting it down is difficult!"
3,Dick York,It is really a shame that a subpar movie like this effectively ended Dick York's career. He could have gone on to so much more with out the injury he sustained on this set.
1,"If it is boring, make sure it's long long long.","This has got to be one of the most boring movies ever made. It goes on and on and on with nothing happening. You would be much less bored at a lecture on the origin of trigonometry. I saw it brand new when I was 15 in 1959. I know I was young, but I saw many serious films that year (I went to the movies every Saturday)--films like Imitation of Life, Anatomy of a Murder, On the Beach, Room At the Top, The Sound and the Fury, and Suddenly Last Summer (to name just a few), and I loved them and stayed interested. I don't think I was too young to appreciate this movie at age 15 because I tried to watch it a couple of years ago on TV and got just as bored. Even with these big stars (mostly just going through the motions here) this is one of the biggest flops in history. Save your money."
2,OK movie runied by a terrible ending,"This could have been so much better but for Cooper's wooden performance as the cowardly major. He's so one-dimensional you want to cry ""please find me an actor!"" THe rest of the cast is pretty good, but the menacing sergeant is really good. At about the 2/3 mark the story began getting very morally complex and I was expecting a great ending, but that's where the movie flops. At the end all the soldiers and the mutinous lieutenant march off willingly to Cordura, led by the sergeant---the one person who could never go there! Terrible! Shame on the director, editor, and writers to ruin what was a slow-moving, stilted affair but which was leading to what promised to be a good climax. The last scene is so ridiculous you'll end up ticked off you wasted your time."
2,"I'm sorry, this movie is a boring.....",I wanted to like this movie. The premise is excellent and not often explored but Cooper was like a Zombie and I love Hayworth but not in this movie. She looked lost. Great actors and wasted in my opinion.Sets were excellent but the acting and story line left much to be desired. Maybe it was the cuts from the original version. I didn't even record it when it was on TV to watch the second time. I felt the first time I saw it I didn't like it.
2,Where's the wide screen,"What a disappointment. I love this movie, but while the ""Format"" said ""Full Screen, Subtitled, Widescreen,"" it was only full screen. I can't think of a movie hurt more by having the ends cut off. The credits were widescreen -- maybe that's what they meant, but this should be clearly stated. I tried flipping it over and my DVD player gave me question marks.It's really a wonderful film, terribly underrated in my opinion. Cooper breathes weariness and pain better than any actor ever has. It's not flamboyant acting, it's just in him (actual chronic back pain may have helped). Hayworth and the evil guys are all wonderful. The panorama, when you can see it, is lonely, dusty and moving. A more ironic and yet deeply inspiring film on heroism was never made.The only thing lacking when you can see the movie correctly (not this DVD) is Sinatra's title song, which wasn't used. Too bad."
2,NOT WIDESCREEN,"Amazon lists this as anamorphic widescreen 2.35 because that is the information printed on the insert in the back of the case.But it is actually full screen, so if you want to watch this film as it was meant to be seen you should avoid this clumsy reproduction."
3,All for the Love of Production Values..,"They Came to Cordura (1959) is an awesome western example of too much money, and not enough script or story. After a brief title card, we have some lackluster dialogue between Gary Cooper and Edward Platt (Chief fromGet Smart the Complete Series -- Seasons 1-5 DVD Box Set) and launch into the most amazing cavalry charge ever to grace the silver screen, outside of Waterloo (1970). The action sequence following it tightly edited and well done as well, but after the banditos are finished, the cameras should have been shut off.If you're looking for some courageous US Cavalry action from the golden age of the mounted soldier, look no further.. but also be aware this film turns into melodrama shortly there after. Well acted, but still melodrama."
1,Disappointed!,"We are huge fans of Veggie Tales and were excited to see a new one out. My daughter likes the original Little Princess so we thought we would love this.It is sweet, but not at all like the others. It has very little (if any) humor, the silly song (my sons' favorite part of Veggie Tales) was beyond silly to the point of just plain dumb and annoying. Because there is a euphemism replacing God's name in vain which is repeated over and over again in this song, we will not be listening to it again. Shame on you Veggie Tales for putting that in a ""religious"" video.None of my children were impressed at all and even MY little princess said she was disappointed. I did get it on sale, but it still wasn't worth the price. I will definitely be pre-viewing any future Veggie Tales before spending any money on them!"
5,Krezip rules,"The new alternative band from the Netherlands is going to be the new standaard of alt. music in Holland,. The simplicity of the music with those deep lyrics,.,.don't think want to say anymore,. By the way, nice girls,."
1,Half of God,"Barclay only addresses one of God's attributes in his study of the Apostle's creed, God is Love. He cheapens the meaning of Christ's death by setting Him up as some ultimate example of love instead of Almighty God redeeming a people for Himself. Barclay completely misses the point of Christ's death, that of saving us from the wrath of God. Barclay's study is not grounded in the truth."
4,The interior life of prayer is the soul of the apostolate.,"""The Soul of the Apostolate"" by Dom Chautard, Cistercian Abbot (1858-1935) was ""warmly recommended"" by Pope St Pius X, who said, ""I value it very highly, and have myself made it my bedside book."" This book encourages the practice of mental prayer. Dom Chautard, following St Thomas Aquinas, says: ""To devote oneself to the life of prayer or to contemplation, or to get others to do so, pleases the Lord more than to give oneslf to good works"" (Pt 1 n. 7)."
4,Excellent,"I picked this up on recommendation of my spiritual director. I was particularly interested in what he called the ""heresy of action"". I'm about one third of the way through and enjoyed it immensely. It is a call to the clergy towards a spiritually rooted vocation through prayer and contemplation. I only dock one star because while it is full of good stuff, it can be fairly dry at times."
5,Good writing is always enjoyable,"I am selective, even in my non-academic reading. If you like history and a good mystery, then like Jecks, Knight's mystery novels are always worth the time."
2,Not what you expect,"You get the frame, you do not get the piece to hold the mattress. The mattress spring is expensive and hard to find. I would not recomment it if you do not have an mattress spring"
3,"OK, but not a great map.","The map of Scotland was good but it definitely needs more detailed maps of Glasgow, Stirling and Edinburgh. We ended up having to buy separate maps of the cities as we traveled. If you're touring the countryside it's OK but not if you're going to be in any of the large cities."
5,To Him Who Sits on the Throne,"My mother had this music on cassette when I was a very young child. When I play it, it brings back some wonderful memories. I love you, Amazon!!!"
2,Falls Flat,The same group without the Closer 'Brenda' I think lacks big time and falls flat. It's not nearly as fun or interesting as the Closer was. I really miss having Brenda in the series.
4,Major Crimes,"It was good to see the old gang, but missed Brenda Lee. Watched the whole season in 3 evenings and enjoyed it. I hope it will continue with a new season."
4,Major Crimes Season 1,"Enjoyed Major Crimes Season 1. I liked The Closer better, but I'm warming up to the new character. I'll come back for Season 2."
5,Excellent series,Love this series. Glad I was able to download the episode from Amazon. We missed the last episode of the season. Can't wait until next season.
1,And they want this to succeed?,"They diss veterans and PTSD, add a brown-nosing and annoying new member, bring back Rusty and tough talk him, and add the kind of deal making that bothers a lot of people...and expect the show to succeed?There is not much to watch on tv. I really like all the old crew. But..I could hardly watch this."
3,Major crimes is a crime,Unfortunately this is not a series that holds your interest like the Closer did. The writing is poor and the acting is just okay. I have watched it all season to see if it might get better and the last episode was better so perhaps it may get there?
3,"Slow beginning, but I'm hopeful","I agree with many others. Don't really like the premise of plea bargaining. However, I do think they are developing a story line that could grow on a person. I was not sure what I thought of Brenda in the beginning either, but over the course of the show they developed her character very well. I for one am more than willing to give this show a chance. I just hope the network does. Most of what is on television on the major networks is worse than terrible (all the reality garbage). I expect the writers have some story lines to develop. But I would like to see Raydor made Commander and the Lt made a Captain with a developing of a good relationship between them (over time)."
2,Disappointed,"I knew it wouldn't be an easy transition, so I am willing to take it slow, but I don't like the direction the show is taking. When Brenda was in charge you knew she would work to bring the criminals to justice. Brenda did her job and then the courts took over, we didn't have to watch that process. How we watch as the Major Crimes and District Attorneys plea bargain with scum bags. I know it happens, but I don't want to see it. Major Crimes was so satisfied with the outcome, patting themselves on the back for a job well done. Sad."
4,Major Crimes premiere,"I was cautiously optimistic about the new series. It was very daring to attempt this extension of The Closer. Based on the first episode of Major Crimes I would say they are off to a great start. Job well done. Ms Sedgwick will be missed, as will Gabriel, ""Brenda's parents"" and others. Mary McD is very bold to attempt to step into shoes so well filled by Kyra. However, I think Rader's character is stong enough, and Mary's performance good enough to succeed at this tough job. I've been a long time fan of Mary McDonnell's anyway and think she did and does a great job. I can see that this new series will contain much of the best of the previous, even if a few important characters are absent. I hope this series makes it. (apologies for any misspelled names)Good job TNT. This almost makes up for getting rid of Saving Grace before it's time, and making them rush to a finish that did not represent the best of that show."
1,"Yeah, I'm done.","Don't know where to begin. Story was loose, characters not believable, relationship to boy hooker domineering, and just...wish I hadn't paid the two bucks to see it."
3,The jury is still out.,"How can Captain Raydor fill Brenda Lee's pumps? They couldn't be more different and Brenda starts out being lovable. Raydor, well, not good off the mark.I don't take to the schtick that every case has to be settled. Too constricting. But then Brenda's was every case gets a confession.The writing is so strong on this show that I think we'll adjust sadly to loss of Brenda. The main characters, except Gabriel, will still be around.I won't miss an episode and hope it lasts as long as The Closer did."
5,A great series - too bad such a short 1st season,"I was skeptical that Major Crimes could be a satisfying continuation of the characters and storylines of The Closer. But this new series has really drawn me in and even appeals to my husband! We really feel emotionally connected to the characters and the stories have had real depth and relevance. I was surprised that it concluded after just 10 episodes, and will look forward to next season!!"
5,moving forward,"I was so disappointed to hear that The Closer was ending. However, Major Crimes has continued a fine tradition of great acting, and great scripts. Its a delight to watch"
5,Mary McDonnell is great!,"This promises to be as good as The Closer because we have most of the cast still intact, but also have the full time addition of Mary McDonnell, a truly accomplished actress (two time Oscar nominee). She plays a fascinating character, eccentric, about 55-ish in age so lacking the vanity found in a younger actress, and able to command the men around her who feel they perhaps should have her job. The two episodes I have seen so far have been great."
5,Keeps getting better,"By episode 4 of ""Major Crimes"" Sharon Rader has won me over completely. She's a great cop but more than that I appreciate her socially awkward moments and especially how well she handles Rusty. The show keeps getting better and I couldn't be happier."
4,Not The Closer but Close,I was glad to see the crew but the dynamics of the group is diff't without BrendaLee. Her quirkiness is what I miss and the way the others interacted with her. Capn Rader is holding her own and I like how the series highlights her knowledge of the theory of law.
3,Major Crimes,"This is an OK series, but there will never be another Kyra Sedywick. Without Kyra there just isn't the fireworks in the series that I have enjoyed for the past 7 years. I wish the crew only the best - but I miss Kyra greatly."
3,Major Crimes,"Very hard to not miss the charisma of Brenda. with Provenza Flinn, Buzz, Tao, Taylor, Fritz, Pope, Gabriel and Det. Daniels.But will give it time to grow. Have only watched first episode so far,"
3,great premise but needs tweeking,If they replaced Mary McDonnell with a more likable actress the show would have a better chance; actually if they brought in a male actor who has not been on the show previously it would probable be a better fit.
2,How do you ruin a great show?,Just ask the producers and writers of the Closer because it sure has gone to crap. And please please get rid of that whiny character Rusty worst part of the show.Concentrate on crimes and solving them like you did with the Closer.
5,Love it...,"It's a good continuation of the Closer. Less humor, but as much suspense and drama, with out Kyra Sedgewicks silly and slightly messy character."
5,Not bad at all,"The last two episodes have been the best. The show is starting to find its pacing without Brenda and they dealt with some pretty tough decisions this time around. I don't envy Sharon her job, that's for sure. Here's hoping the season continues to build its momentum this way. Now I'm curious about when Rusty will appear in court."
2,No need for a supercop,"Branda in ""the closer"" series outsmarts any other coworker, and can close hard cases without enough evidence. No doubt such character does not belong to the reality, with both hands tighten up by both political and economic reasons. ""major crimes"" is a show telling more realistic stories about how ordinary cops do they jobs. The good side is, they don't look like fools any more, especially Provenza shows his ability to co-lead the division. And Captain Raydor is exactly the best person makes her coworker smarter. It is common sense that one can only replace a superstar by team work, and this is what the show is about.The bad side is, I don't quite think the show charming any more. Just another ordinary criminal show. It is precisely the reason I find the last two season of ""the closer"" suddenly becomes boring: nobody can escape from reality, super heroes and heroines are already dead."
4,The Closer continues,"Similar to the Closer. I like very much. The crew was credible, likeable and at times funny. I hope it continues for some time."
2,can not compete with the closer,the series is not as good as the closer. It;s a sad thing that the closer is not there anymore. Main character is bad
4,"Major Crimes, major hit!","As a HUGE ""The Closer"" fan, I am thrilled with Major Crimes! Not a Closer copy, it is darker, more intense. Captain Raydor continues to develope into a wonderful, sarcastic, lady who - as Brenda had to do - is earning the respect of her department. We get to continue with our MC family AND an occasional visit by Fritzy is ALWAYS a plus! Thanks!"
3,O K but not the Closer quality!,The acting was O K but the total result does not live up topast stories and drama of the Closer.
5,William from Ashley River Creative Arts El.,Mrs. Sneed read More Than Anything Else to me and I love it. The pictures were colorful and creative. My favorite part was when Booker T. Washington got the alphabet book. When you look at Chris Soentpiet's illustrations it feels like your heart is full of happiness and joy!! His textures are the best. I loved the first page illustrations because it looked like little pieces of salt.
3,"Great ideas, lovely paintings, but... Not so engrossing for the little ones","What's not to like? This book has beautiful art and a flowing narrative. It speaks eloquently of the African-American experience and it focuses on the allure of reading. Everything about this book is commendable. Alas, ""commendable"" is not necessarily what a child is seeking in a book. At my daughter's school library I was only the 2nd person to borrow this book in 6 years! Children at her school are not choosing this book, not rereading this book, not recommending it to their friends. That says something. (To be fair, there are zero Black kids at this Indonesian school, but then again they do enjoy lots of Black themed books). I think it's too easy for adults to approve of this book... perhaps we ought to see if children are drawn to it as well. I'm sad I can't recommend this book more highly."
5,Why haven't this book won the Caldecott?,"This is by far, one of my favorite children's books of all time. If anyone have seen the beautiful watercolour paintings in this book, you'll also wonder why this book haven't receive the attention it fully deserves. Not only are the illustrations exquisite but Bradby's text is brilliantly poetic. This book will reminds us of a time when not everyone had a chance at an education where some kids today foolishly take for granted. It takes us back to the simplicity of a time when there were no computers, cell phones, or any of today's over overindulging gluttony. This book teaches us about the human spirit and what we can do with the power of words. This is an overlooked book during the Caldecott selection process. I hope that everyone will have a chance to see the beauty in this book. If you can't wait to have Amazon.com send this to you, go to the library and check it out yourself. It is an amazing piece of work in both text and art!"
3,....,"I give this book 3 stars because ther is a boy named Booker T. Washington that wants to know how to read.Well, you have to read it to find out if he learns how to read or if he can not read."
4,Josh....,It is about one of my favorite historical men. I like all the illustrations. Booker t Washington realy wants to read.If you get to read this book you will find out if he gets to read in his life.I give this book four stars.
4,A $25 headphone!!!!! Wow,"I give to this headphone 4 stars just because I know that out there you can find a lots better than this one, but come on, this is a $25 headphones with a very good performance!!! And for a DJ (beginner or amateur) is enough!!I really recommend it!!Just let me advice you about a headhache after 20 minutes of listen to music!! It looks like this is for very small head people."
3,Good for the money,Not a bad product for the money i spent the main thing i dont like is that i feel like im going to break them when i use them
5,"""Excellent Product""","Gemini DJX-05 HeadphonesProfessional Headphones at the level of other famous brands, definitely the best."
2,Good enoff,"The sound quality is good, although unlike others, I missed some more bass and maybe a little more volume. Did do a good job cutting outside noises. Como with an adaptor, so you can use them on 3.5mm jacks or the ""bigger ones"" (the ones you can find in professional sound systems, but I forget their specs...). Build quality seems decent (plastic, but doesn't fell flimsy), although the place where is rotates (a kind of rotator cup) seems like it could brake under little pressure...Very long cable (which is good), and the last half of it is spiraled like a phone cable...------UPDATE: I hardly use, just because the sound is so low and lacking. Also can't use it when doing some light DJing at partys even, because the noise isolation is almost null. The only good thing I have to say about it, is that the build and material are good. Maybe you'll have better luck with a high output mixer..."
2,"Lacks adjustment, Cord not long enough.","The single cord on one ear phone was good, but the cord was not long enough. It should have been about 12 to 15 feet. If somebody is buying headphones with an accordian cord, they obviously need to move around with it. I couldn't reach much of anything in the DJ Booth. Better to have too much cord than not enough. The headband adjustment is limited. I needed it to go smaller, but the adjustment stopped short and the earphones were below my ears. I have to wear a hat in order to use them. Sound quality is okay. Overall, it's not what I was hoping for, but kinda gets the job done."
2,Not worth the cheap price,"Pros:- Sound is actually pretty good.Cons:- HURTS your ears really badly. After about 15 min your ears will be throbbing with pain.- Super cheap material. It feels like it will break at any moment. Plastic is hollowed out, it has no weight to it and the wiring is so plasticy i barely unravels.- The ones I got looked as if they were used before. Scuffs and dings everywhere.I regret having bought these mainly because of the pain they cause my ears. I understand the cheap material for a cheap product, but it shouldn't cause me pain. Wish i had just spent a bit more for a better brand."
5,"We really thought ""Cyber"" was going to be something...","This book is a neat tribute, in a funny way, to the ""Cyber"" culture in mainly the cities and the expanding ""Internet"" in the early 90s. Still worth reading for all its inspirational stuff, taken with a realistic grain of salt."
3,3 1/2 sherikins & 3 propeller bennies. Comical & serious.,This is problay the only book of it's kind that isn't flaged by the feds. The style of writting is cool. It gives a how-to approch with out having a step-by-step. You can also tell the authors had a blast!! wrighting the book.
2,"""Warning! This is not serious!"" --Kurt Harland","Cyberpunk really is dead.. the appearance of the official handbook clinched it. If you want to learn how to hack, don't buy this book. If you want to become a phone phreak, don't buy this book. If you want to become a cypherpunk or a coder, don't buy this book. If you're familiar with the genre of cyberpunk as literature or have had contact with subcultures that could be considered cyberpunk, get this book if you want to get a chuckle or two, or try to recognise some of the folks who posed for this book. If you're looking for net.culture to be lampooned nine ways from Sunday, get this book."
1,run don't walk away from this product,"If you are considering this product run don't walk away as fast as you can. first if you don't have a dedicated spot the size of an electric can opener right next to an outlet the cleaning system is a total waste of money. It does an adequate job shaving legs, but unless you have under arms as tough as leather this razor will rip your under arm to shreds and leave them painful for a couple of days."
2,Cleaning cycle never stops,"I purchased this for my wife when she was very happy with her previous one that broke. Sadly it was discountinued everywhere but I purchased it from Amazon anyway. She loves the razor however it arrived with an issue. When the cleaning cycle finishes, it just keeps running until unplugged.Amazon was happy to return it, but my wife likes this unit very much and prefers to unplug it when the cleaning cycle finishes instead of trying to find another unit she likes."
2,Dies,Not sure if I just received a defective one or if it is just piece of poo. Either way it dies before I get even close to shaving both legs.
1,Didn't work well,"After fulling charging the first time, it never would charge properly again. The recharge light would intermittently come on and would take about a week to get a decent charge. I could only run the cleaning function when the green charging light was on, which was infrequently. After owning it for two months, it now will not charge at all."
2,good for legs and that's about it,"it shaves legs just fine, although you have to go over the same area a few times before its smooth.don't try to shave anything else. I tried to do under my arms and my bikini this morning and lets just say I didn't win the war. My skin is all cut up. it yanks hair and grabs/cuts skin if you are using on ""curves"" like bikini line.it is only safe on straight surfaces like legs.it also has been charging since I got it 4 days ago and its still not fully charged. it is constantly blinking."
2,nice design but...,"This product does not work if you have soft blonde hair. My hair is not coarse and this razor just glided right over top with out cutting a thing. It's comfortable to hold and seems like it is made well, but it is definatly not for those of us with soft hair."
3,cheaper than razor blades in the long run,"This is the first time I've used an electric razor. After 3 weeks of diligently shaving with it every day as the instructions state, I am not exactly in love with it. Although my legs *look* shaved, I can feel the short little stubble. It simply does not compare to a regular razor blade for smoothness. My armpit skin has not adjusted to it and I have to be very careful or it hurts and leaves red marks that sting. I've gone back to a regular razor for my armpits. Overall, it is handy, my legs look nice, the cleaning station works fine, and I love that it is usable in or out of the shower. For those sexy occasions I am going to revert back to a regular razor for the silky-smooth skin but for every day use I will stick with the electric razor because it is way cheaper than razor blades."
4,Very Nice product for such a good price,"Its convenient to use, no risk of cuts as in razors and hair growth after use is very soft as compared to razors. Cleaning and handling is also very easy, i have found this product to be very confortable to use compared to other methods. Would definitely recommend this to my friends."
1,Save your money!!,"I've owned two of these shavers so far. The first one worked great and delivered a close, nick-free shave...for about six months. It then stopped re-charing and died altogether. I contacted the helpful customer service people at Remington, mailed it to them, and they sent me a brand new one shortly afterwards. It lasted a month before the same thing happened. I now have to mail the defective replacement to them and hope I can just get my money back and find something that works. Very disappointed in this product."
3,Remington WDF-7000 shaver,I was somewhat disappointed with this shaver only because the handle is so narrow it's hard for a gal with large hands to hold. It works well on underarms but misses leg hair. I don't like the idea of the cleaning system as I probably will never use it since it takes up too much room.
2,The shipping charges are too expensive especially if you have to send it back as I did.,"I read good reviews for this product so I ordered it for a Christmas present. First off Discount Jungle is who you buy from, not Amazon so you have to pay ALL shipping charges, even if it's defective which mine was.So, not only did I have to pay the 10 for initial shipping, but I had to pay 15 priority mail because they had to have it there in 14 days. So, I'm out 25.00 shipping on a 40 dollar product.Sure wish I had not purchased it!"
5,Great Shaver,"This is the best shaver Ive used ever! Its easy to operate and the cleaning/charging base is simple to use too. No negatives about this product. Extremly close shave, smooth results, always ready to use. Easy to take on trip also.If I could give it 10 stars I would."
2,Not worth the money...,"This razor is not worth the money. It did shave pretty well for a few months, but the rubber strips wear out really quickly. And, even though the ""cleaning option"" with the fluid seems like a great idea... it does not work very well... the razor was never clean... and refilling the fluid is just a pain... I would not recommend this razor."
3,Not as good as old Norelco,"This shaver is really noisy. Also, had a closer shave with old Norelco. Disappointed."
3,Screen broken already,My wife used the shaver 3 times and the screen broke other then that it works well.
1,"old products sent, no customer response","I received an older product with nickle in the foil, which makes skin black when used. When I called the company they sent replacement blades, but the plastic protector cover wouldn't fit. They sent a replacement; once again it was the old product with the same problem. When I called again, they said all their foils have nickle. Other companies have a stainless protector. Need I say more. You get what you pay for."
1,Remington,I am on my 4th shaver and even bought new components for current one. Not smooth and not enough charge. Dies after less than 2 minutes. Won't buy Remington again.
5,sooo happy,"As someone who can no longer use a razor, due to health reasons, I must say that I am so very happy with this shaver. Gets close and I have no problem with razor burn, pulling, reshaving (leaves hairs behind and have to go back over the same place more than 1). When I shave, it is a relaxation time for me so I do just that and then I don't fight with an object. I thought I'd be unhappy with any rechargeable shaver, but I am very happy with this one. It's quiet. It competes with the regular razor, for sure. Thanks for reading."
1,Norelco Veteran,"I have had many Norelcos in my life.So I can testify that when I say this shaver cuts the skin, it cuts the skin.Norelco designed the blades in a way that negates the need for the user to get in close around lips etc...I was bleeding in the first minute.It seems that overall quality seems to have droppedBlade life and battery life has descreased as wellMy 6885xl has broken parts and a bad batteryMaybe I can find an older model with the older blades somewhere"
3,Fair design but a great shave,"PROS: Good shave, feels good in the hand and easy to clean.CONS: The stand is not nearly as good as my old Norelco 985RX, I have to put it on a little carefully or the shaver topples over. I don't like the on off switch, it's a button and takes a little too much pressure to use, I prefer the slide on off switch that my old Norelco had. Compared to my old shaver Norelco, the display is too small and dark a little hard to read, my old Norelco is big, bright and very easy to read, they really went backwards in this part of the design.NIT PICKING: It feels like the blades should spin faster but since the shave is so good, probably not fair to put this as a con.CONCLUSION: I love the shave compared to my old Norelco 985RX and that's what matters the most, I would buy it again, but that switch, stand and display make me give this item three stars."
2,Too delicate for travel....,"I have been using Norelcos for over 20 years to shave. They have certainly improved in all aspects over the years, except one - ruggedness. The floating head design in the newer shavers have become so delicate that they really cannot stand up to the tear and wear of a frequent traveler. My second one broke within a year and I have not dropped it anywhere. I suspect keeping the razor in checked-in baggage makes the plastic brittle in the typically cold baggage hold and any small knock is going to break several tabs that exist to keep the blades in place. They really need to be carried in a hard shell. Once any of these several failure points break, there is nothing you can do with the razor as you cannot get a replacement.Avoid the current line of brands unless you use this primarily at home and never intend to drop it!"
5,Times of Worship,"Your services and the quality of this product were perfect. This was a CD of worship music that I had lostyears ago. I thought it was lost to me forever, but we found it on Amazon and I am so happy."
5,hosanna worship,This a great cassette one of the older ones. Highly recommended for praise and worship.
2,HO HUM,"My husband is from Haiti and as an avid collector of world music, I invested in a half dozen CDs claiming to be from Haiti, one of which is voo doo drums. Obviously the title is meant to appeal to the sensalistic western buyer with no knowledge of the old ways from Africa. I found this recording boring. I like music that stirs an emotional response from me, be it Native American songs preparing for war or Maria Callas singing in La Traviata or Mongolian throat singers. I believe that it is possible to find true african drumming recordings that tell a spellbinding story of healing or coming of age or prevailing in warfare and other events of importance. These stir the soul of the listener. Voo Doo drums is not authentic anything."
1,"Nice case, bad quality","I loved the look of the case when I first got it, however came to realize that the craftsmanship is not very good.Within a week the case began turning yellow. It wasn't dirt and it doesn't come off no matter what I tried to clean it with. Returned case, will never buy again. :("
3,As pleased as I can be.,I bought the shaver and replacement heads along with the shaver. We haven't used the replacement heads yet and don't expect to for some time but the shaver is good for the price. My husband has bought more expensive ones and has not been satisfied with their performance so we went ahead and tried this low cost shaver. My husband says the heads don't seem to rotate fast enough but it does an OK job for the price.
1,Norelco replacement part,"What a huge mistake!! Talked to a representative at Philips Norelco because I could not find a part for the model I had. After they advised me as to what part I needed and gave me the model number I needed, I ordered it from Amazon. Well, it doesn't even come close to fitting. Needless to say it was a wasted $25. I went out and bought a Braun Electric Razor which I know is better."
1,Norelco Shaver Blades,My order was sent to the wrong address and therefor it was cancelled and I hope to order again soon. I need to be sure that the credit for the first order was made. I still want the replacement blades.
1,How do you do it?,Have been unable to remove and replace with the new heads because the instructions are very poor and totaly lacking with any detail. Have given up for now and placed them on a shelf to await a time when I feel that I can devote a lot of effort on this small endeavor that has become a major problem for me. In the mean time I have gone back to using disposable razors.
4,norelco replacement heads,Standard brand item at a low price. used the option to have periodic deliveries and saved even more.
1,Do not buy HQ55(+); no longer made and the cheaper HQ56 work,"I was looking for replacement shaver heads for my older Noreclo model 6613X electric shaver. On the shaver it says to only use HQ55+ replacement heads. This seller had the only HQ55+ heads on Amazon. Do not buy the HQ55 or HQ55+ from this or any other seller. Norelco no longer makes either. Instead, this seller will send you HQ56 replacement heads, which works just as well but can be purchased for about $4 less directly from Amazon (plus no shipping if you are an Amazon Prime customer). No where in the product description does the seller indicate this is actually an HQ56 rather than an HQ55, which is deceptive and will cost more for the same product. The HQ56 heads are fine. It is nice to have a nice close shave again, I only wish I did not feel as though I was taken advantage of by an unscrupulous advertiser."
3,sharp enough?,Bought the NORELCO brand as I assumed these would be better than another replacement mfg. After installing I'm wondering if the blades are as sharp as they should be... seems the razor doesn't cut quite as good as it used to??
5,Philips Norelco HQ 55,Ordered an HQ55 replacement heads. Received HQ56 instead but they worked the same. Shipment was fast. Can no longer find the replacement heads in a store.
1,Norelco replacement cutters,I have been a Norelco customer for over 27 years and I have never had a set of cutters dull so quickly. In my opinion the quality is down
2,How about sending the pictured merchandise?,"The HQ55s fit, but their not the HQ55plus...whats up with that? Sure they cut beard, so...why not picture what your really sending??? Buy here if you don't mind a bait and switch."
4,Close shave,Replacement blades for my shaver are becoming harder to find. This web site made it easy to find the correct replacement part and order same.
4,New life for old shaver.,"I recently ordered from Amazon a replacement head for my old Norelco Shaver,was going to buy a new shaver but decided to try a new cutting head instead.It works fine,if it lasts a year I'am ahead of the game.Amazon's service was first rate."
4,Norelco razor heads,"I received the box of razor heads for my Norelco electric razor in the mail promptly, immediately popped the old ones out, the new ones in, and shaved before 15 minutes had gone by. I hadn't replaced the heads for two years. Finally, a quick clean shave."
4,Works Great,"Delivered on time, and cuts much better that what I had (which were exactly the same) because they were blunt. Overall very happy and would order again."
2,HQ 55 Not HQ 55 plus as described,"This item arrived quickly and seems to work, but it is not HQ 55 plus as described,and there are 3 replacement heads instead of 6. This is really another part number which is at least $6 cheaper. Now it is used and cannot be returned. Amazon should not allow this kind of deception."
5,Norelco Shaver Heads,"I should have ordered these a LONG time ago, I had no idea what I was missing! It takes me HALF the amount of time to shave, and my Norelco Shaver is like NEW again!"
3,Not as good as the originals,The heads are not as good as what you get with the new shaver. Expensive for the quality that you get
5,Why buy a new razor?,Hubby has replaced the heads on his Norelco a number of times and it works like brand new!
5,Norelco Blade Review,"The Blades worked flawlessly. They even apprear to be sharper after (2) weeks of use. Prompt delivery by amazon as well. Thanks for a job well done.Tom, in Virginia Beach."
2,Dulled quickly,"Nice at first, but within a month I was having trouble with razor burn on my neck and all sorts of missed hair; worse than my original heads. Tolerated for 3 months, then bought a foil shaver, which always worked well for my beard in the past. YMMV."
1,Norelco HQ55 Plus Reflex Shaver Head,"I expected the new shaver head to shave better and closer than the old one, but it does not."
4,Norelco HQ55,Replacement cutter heads for an excellent electric razor. I have had this razor for several years and it gives a great shave. Cutter heads need replacement every 6 months.
4,Replacement Head,"This is better than buying a new razor,it's cheaper and you will feel like you have a new razor."
4,Very good,The Norelco replacement heads were very good. I replace them about once a year and find the at satisfactory.
3,Slow Delivery,Product is as advertised but delivery was extremely slow. Took almost 3 weeks to get to me. Unacceptable and I probably wont order from this supplier again.
4,NORELCO HQ55 REPLACEMENT HEADS,PRODUCT IS FINE AND SHIPPMENT CAME IN ON TIME AND AT A FAIR PRICE. WOULD RECOMMEND AND AM SATISFIED.
5,Close shave at Amazon,"I was getting a little shaggy, in need of a shave. My Norelco electric razor was in good working order, but the blades were dull and refused to cut any more. Believe it or don't, I couldn't find replacement blades anywhere in this rinky-dink city, so that's when I went to Amazon. They had all the replacements, including mine, so I ordered. And while I was at it, I ordered replacement blades for my old antique Schick injector razors, which had provided me with many a good shave in the past. So now, thanks to the diversity of Amazon.com, I am a clean-shaven man!"
4,Norelco Replacement Heads,Replacement heads are very easy to change. They workjust as good as the original heads.
3,Easy installation - Little change in performance,"I changed the heads on my shaver after about a year-and-a-half of use. I had noticed a less close, harsher shaver. There was some improvement after changing the heads, but not that impressive. It's relatively easy to change the heads, but some parts can fall out, so you have to be careful."
4,Norelco HQ shaver Heads,even though i was sent a different product # HQ56 rather than HQ55 without a reason whyafter some ado with the vendor i was informed the HQ56 replaced HQ55.HQ56 did fit my razor and it cuts very well.
2,Beware of what you get,"I went to Amazon.com to purchase a Norelco ReflexPlus-6 replacement razor head--HQ55 Plus. Amazon itself did not have the product, so they sent me to another company on their site. Although Amazon said the shipping would be free, the subsidiary company did not. And they sent me a Norelco Reflex head--not the plus 6 that I ordered. Although the instructions with the razor say Plus-6, the subsidiary company said no such part exists! Not a happy introduction to Amazon.com shopping."
5,Better than new,New blades are great. Hard to remember but I think the shaver works better now than when new.
4,norelco shaver heads,"As usual the product worked fine, I have never been disappointed by a product received from Amazon."
4,Charlie's Review of Replacement Cutters,I am well pleased with my purchase of the HQ55 replacement cutters for my Norelco Shaver. Response time was excellent and the price was good. Also I had trouble finding the item locally. Thank you.
4,Norelco HQ55,Very good product. Fits the electric shaver well and works well. Would buy these again when it is time to replace.
5,Great Price on Hard to Find Replacement,Makes your old shaver feel brand new. There is no reason to buy a new shaver when the blades are right here.
4,Morello shaver head replacement,My old razor works like new. I am very satisfied and recommend this replacement head to anyone seeking to make their old razor just like new.
5,Much Cheaper than buying from Philips/Norelco,"Philips/Norelco recommends replacing your shaver heads annually. These are priced much better than their own site, and the quality is the same."
5,Gives an improved shave,"Second successful time to replace Norelco's HQ55 Plus heads. I replace on an annual basis. This year's replacement seems to give a better shave, as was stated to expect by the replacement documentation. Job well done."
3,Norelco replacement shaving heads,The product works fine. The life of the heads is not very good - about 1 year and the expense is too high.
1,Crossed Wires,"Amazon screwed up the order. Twice. I ordered the replacement razors for HQ 55Plus. In the mail came replacement razors for HQ 55. Twice. In contacting the first seller, they said Amazon had the wrong codes listed. So I tried with a second seller through Amazon. Still no luck. Hope they fix it soon."
2,Sent wrong item!,"WOW not good news! As you can see from the picture the HQ55 Plus comes in a Blue wrapper. Well I received and orange wrapper with the HQ55 not the HQ55 Plus ( a totally different, non-compatable, item). I called and they said ""oh we don't have the BLUE one -Dah! I sent it back and after about 4 weeks got a credit on my charge card. Needless to say I am not happy as this was substituted and not correct!"
2,"Too much hype, not enough solid information","This book was highly recommended as I began my search for evidence based information on raw feeding. As a veterinarian I found the book to be sorely lacking in solid, useful information and instead found much of the same hype and extreme thought that usually turns people off of raw feeding. I wanted to learn more objectively how raw truly promotes health but instead had to read page after page about how ignorant many vets are with regard to pet nutrition and how the pet food companies all want to kill our pets and profit from it. While both of those thoughts may or may not be true, this was not the reason I chose this book. I thought a book written by an alternative minded veterinarian would help me learn the benefits of raw feeding for clients. This book did not help me begin to learn raw feeding for my own pets, let alone clients."
3,Too much about Tom Lonsdale,"This book is really a lot more about the author than about raw feeding. It seems to centralize on the problems he faced getting his views accepted (raw feeding dogs) If you really want a basic book that is easier to understand and gets right to the point, then purchase his other book - Work Wonders. Has basically the same info, but without all the personal details."
5,Accurate how-to information and vital information for all,"Dr. Lonsdale writes a wonderful book that tells a story, advances theory, exposes corruption and helps us help ourselves and our pets. The last Chapter, Chapter 14, brings raw feeding and pet health into focus at the leading edge of science. This book should be read and re-read by laymen and professionals in many fields. I noticed one reviewer complained that there was no 'how-to information' but I disagree. Dr. Lonsdale devotes an appendix to the 'how-to' and presents it in a simple, easy-to-read and easy-to-accomplish fashion. Much about the 'how-to' can seem daunting and ridiculous in the writings of others but Dr. Lonsdale makes it easy and takes the intimidating out of it. And then he gives us so much more."
4,Worth the money,"The only reason I am not giving this one 5 stars is because the book is a little repetitive, which makes it hard to pay attention to at times. BUT, this is a very well put-together book. Mr. Lonsdale provides plenty of 'sources' for every claim he makes, not just leaving you to 'take his word for it' cuz he's a Vet. (Like the Billinghurst books, ahem). You can feel confident that the author has done his research & that he has no hidden agenda going on. This book is less of a 'how to' guide, & more of an expose of the vet profession's greedy underworld. He does follow this book up with another, shorter, easier to read book 'Work Wonders' which helps the reader get started with raw feeding. I would recommend getting both books. (although the cartoon artwork in the second book is a little silly & takes something away from the credibility of the author, unfortunately...)."
5,a must-read for those interested in dog nutrition,"Dr. Lonsdale's book, ""Raw Meaty Bones"" is probably the single most important piece of literature on the subject of raw feeding and the pet food industry that has been published to date.This book offers an in depth, behind the scenes look at the pet food industry and its practices as well as the resistance of the veterinary profession to acknowledge the damage that processed foods have caused to our dogs.Dr. Tom has, at a great personal cost, written a truly great book which deserves close attention from dog owners, breeders, trainers as well as anyone working in the animal medical care profession. It ought to be obligatory reading for veterinary students.I highly recommend it."
3,no subject,"The concept of this book is very good, however, it is far more technical than I had anticipated.The shipping charges from Amazon were deliberately outrageous from Amazon, as they wanted me to subscribe to another of their buying programs, so I won't recommend buying from Amazon."
2,ANOTHER DISAPOINTMENT,"FOR SOME REASON THIS SHOE REALLY APPEALED TO ME, BUT OF COURSE IT WAS TOO LONG. I HAVE A NARROW FOOT, AND FINDING SHOES THAT FIT IS SO HARD FOR ME, SO WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE TO RETURN IT."
3,Nice flat,"I just needed a basic blue flat pump, and it fit the bill. However, it was too big (at least by a half size) and rubbed my feet. I will be returning these or will give them to a friend."
5,Shoes With Comfort Plus Style,"Very comfortable pair of shoes from the moment you put them on. True to size and perfect heel for those who hate those wobbly high heels. By themselves these shoes are plain looking, but put them with a nice pair of pants or dress, and they compliment what you are wearing beautifully. At the price Amazon has them for, you can get two for the price of what one might cost on other websites."
2,try before u buy,"I was disappointed in the fit of this shoe. All of my other Easy Spirits have been very comfortable. This one hurt the top of my foot where the shoe ends. This shoe has a slippery bottom except for the heel, not good for teachers or those walking on tiled floors."
5,Charming Old Fairy Tales,"I first read these tales when I was a child (I'm in my 60's now)and I still have the original book, which is now in tatters. I was enchanted with them as a child and still enjoy them now. The stories are, of course, about the triumph of goodness and virtue; isn't that what most children's fairy tales are about? They're sweet, and heartwarming, and charmingly written and a refreshing break from the standard tales that everyone knows. And if you don't know what a grimalkin is, well, I've known since I was a child...and this book is the reason why."
2,"4-star taste, 2-star ingredients","This stuff is tasty but caveat emptor: it's glorified non-dairy creamer, which is the first ingredient. Enjoy this with artificially flavored vanilla sandwich cookies."
1,"It's an average beef, potato and carrot stew. Women love it.","I personally do not care for this beef stew. My mother and niece absolutely love it. I find the gravy a bit greasy. The meat is not whole pieces, but rather compressed ground hamburger. The potatoes and carrots are what you would expect from canned food. I have been stocking up on Bulk Canned food with an expiration date of at least 1.5 years from date of purchase. You would be surprised at how fast some canned food expires! Yes, the economy is collapsing under Obama and his Communist Marxist agenda. Stock up now. The current price and vendor for Dinty Moore Beef Stew is ridiculously overpriced. Do NOT buy your bulk from this vendor ""Huggy's Haven"". Looks like they pulled the price out from their #$$. They are double the price compared to any grocery store."
5,JOHN DEER ROCKS,This was a fast and perfectly easy transaction. The kids love the trucks and they have been a great pleasure. :)
5,"a great listen(unoriginal, i know)","I love this CD. All the lyrics are amazing and the songs are just overall great. I have not heard any of their other CDs(only songs) so i have no comparison but if you like ""armageddon"" or ""stupid kid"" by them, i am sure you will like this CD as well because the sound is not much different."
5,Great Bike,"I've had this bike for a week and have been trying to find a bad thing to say about it. Truth is I can't. I'm having a blast with it. Sturdy and well made this bike has got some pep. When @ full throttle it out performs the 7th gear, so pedaling is useless. So far I haven't tested the 15 mile claim. But my favorite story is leaving the neighborhood attack dogs in the dust. The only downer might be that the battery only has an estimated years' worth of charges and I'm not sure how much a replacement is."
1,Dont buy!!,This did not fix my 1990 geo prizm. It did not fix on the fuel rail or even plug in to the injector harness.
4,"Al Janssen writes about going to baseball games with his son, Jonathan","You follow along as Al Janssen writes about building memories with his son Jonathan while going to baseball games together. There are also FYI boxes, such as THE WHOLE GAME-Why I have to be at the game for the very first pitch. or GREAT MOMENTS I WISH I COULD HAVE SEEN IN PERSON - Merkle's boner, A Babe Ruth home run... There are also boxes with quotes from players, broadcasters, and coaches ie: ""It could be, It might be, It is! A home run!"" ~play-by-play by Harry Caray, ""Baseball is like church, many attend, few understand ""~ Leo Durocher ~ Great paintings by Jim Daly. Book size is 8"" x 8"" 48 pages. If you're looking for verse or poems as in other books Jim Daly's paintings are in, then this book isn't for you. If you're a baseball fan I think you will enjoy Al Janssen's fond memories about the game."
5,Great book,"As baseball season opens and Father's Day draws near, you might want to give serious consideration to getting your dad or favorite baseball fan this little book. It takes readers on a sentimental journey of how special the sport is to the author. You share his enchantment reliving great moments in sports history and the enjoyment of introducing his children to a beloved passtime. Trivia and suggestions to enhance one's enjoyment are given throughout, and drawings worthy of Thomas Kinkade or Sandra Kluck bring the book to vivid life."
5,Gorgeous!,"Great trip hop -- very mellow and smooth, beautiful vocals that perfectly compliment and don't overpower the grooves."
3,Everyone Loves You,"When I heard pappelallee I was thrilled because, although some tracks seemed somewhat halfheartedly made - other tracks like fade out and option have a sound to them that could makes me want to listen to them over and over again.Naturally, I was happy to buy this album, hoping there would be more of the stuff found in the above mentioned tracks on Pappelallee. This album, rather, seems even more bifurcated between what seems to be solid and full of potential, that is, the instrumental parts of the tracks, and what I think is borderline amateurish singing.I would've much rather found the singing downplayed and the ambient instrumental parts upheld. Especially the female singer gets on my nerves - her voice doesn't seem to compliment the mood and sound of the instruments and sounds used.With that said, there is a couple of tracks on this album, that I find captivating enough to keep listening to."
3,For DJ's - Some Great Raw Chill Tracks Ready for Remixing,"For Dj's, some nice, sleek, sparse, open-ended minimalist tracks that's a perfect 'chill' starter base for you to build upon. If you're a DJ, you can add another star - for straightforward listening, it's solid twee trip hop/atmospheric chill but most sound just a bit incomplete for just listening."
5,"A collectors item, cool package, Great companion to Import Cd collection","This set is a collection of 6 popular singles released by Black Sabbath from 1970-1978 (note list above, song 1 on the Cd is the A side and 2 would have been ""the B side). Included is a nice mini poster of the cover art of different singles released around the world. Unfortunately, for 6 Cds, only 12 songs total in this set. They are packaged in the Neat replica Cd sleeves. This is a great companion to the Import Black Sabbath Replica CD collection. Not a necessity for a Sabbath fan, but for a Hardcore sabbath fan, this is a cool little addition to the collection. I was hoping that they may release a second box of other singles sabbath had, but in 5 years it hasn't happend."
5,Springfield's Best CD Compilation,"Covers all the big U.S. hits, from ""Jessie's Girl"" to his last top 40 hit, 1988's ""Rock of Life."" A full 19 tracks, most of them top 30. Sadly, his early 70's hit ""Speak to the Sky"" is off, as is his humorous mistaken identity novelty hit, ""(They Call Me) Bruce."""
5,Concise and eloquent,"I originally bought this book for a class that has nothing to do with my major field of study. Two semesters later, I still find myself quoting from it. This is a tell-tale sign of a worthwhile investment.It does start out a bit dense, but while I read the beginning parts several times over, it was well worth the time and effort. Reams worth of seemingly timeless insight into great power relations and the nature of both explicit and implicit hegemonic interactions are packed into a concise single volume without any apparent loss of eloquence.It made for a good complement to Donald Kagan's ""The Origins of War and the Preservation of Peace"", which is a less theoretical volume of case studies exploring the historical causes and contexts of certain past hegemonic hostilities."
2,Academically boring,"I was assigned to read this work as a student in Prof. Thompson's International Relations 101 class at the University of Virginia. Now, maybe it was because I was assigned the book in class; maybe it was the dry and dense nature of the work; maybe it was the fact that the lectures turned one off to the reading completely; this book accomplishes too main things in that it is BOTH incredibly dry and overly dense. A struggle to wade through at times. I must admit that there are a couple of useful nuggest in the book if one has the time to mine them out. A couple things stick in the readers mind (such as power in international relations is the ability to control men's minds and actions). Besides these few and far between items, the reading is like Chinese drip torture...not fun nor interesting."
1,does this book ever end,if you are a college student like me you expect books to get straight to the point..i was assigned to read the book and i had to stop after 40 pages because i had no idea what i had just read..someone should invent cliffs notes for this book..i feel sorry for you if you have to read it!!

Amazon had only one and after paying 2 day shipping it was still cheaper that any store price that we had seen. We received it the Sat. before Christmas and the look on our 16 month old's face was priceless!! Christmas day she rode it until the battery ran down. Thank you amazon for being so promt and helping us make our daughters Christmas perfect
