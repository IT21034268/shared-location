2,I smell another creed knock off...,"Yes, these guys smell a whole lot like yet another creed knock off band that is trying to imitate a band that, although very succesful, is wholey remarkable themeselves. Dang, the music just gets worst every year, and the fact that these guys are from Canada, home of Default and Nickelback, certanly does NOT help there cause! I didn't like Creed when they first came out, and I haven't liked them or any band that has tried to cop of there formula since.So thus, in short, I smell another Creed, which is why they must be stamped out AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!"
4,A watered down OLP,"I bought Gravity eagerly when it came out. I was a little worried about Bob Rock being the producer (this being the same guy that ruined Metallica), but I kept an open mind about it. In the end, I've come to the conclusion that this album is a serious let-down. It feels rushed and shallow. I liked the general feel of ""Happiness..."" and the concept of ""Spiritual Machines"". This album, however, just feels like it was made for the radio, and I HATE mainstream radio. There are a couple of good songs on the album (All For You, Not Enough, Somewhere out There), but the rest is just too cliched.While it is a good album on its own merits (on the sheer talent of the band), it just seems like the band was going for mainstream US success more than making great music.Well, at least I wont get as many blank stares when people look through my CDs."
2,Disappointing.,"After their last effort(Spiritual Machines), those of us old-line OLP fans were waiting excitedly for the next release.However, during the hiatus, they cast off their lead guitar player and took up with the King of Homogenized Rock(Bob Rock).The result: A quite boring outing. A sound not that far from the other bands. Creed.....with a different singer. You could see Metallica doing this stuff(without the snarling singer).One of the salient truths of rock and roll: Everybody sells out, eventually.This is OLP's sellout album."
2,ehhh....,"of the 4 OLP albums I have (I'm missing Naveed), this one is the worst. It does not contain anywhere near as much feeling and soul as Clumsy, Happiness..., and Spiritual Machines have. These guys are my second favorite band, and I love them to death, but they struck out on this one. While some of the songs are definitely good, on the whole, not anywhere close to their best work."
2,*Shakes head sadly*,"I've been a big fan of Our Lady Peace but this new record is not Our Lady Peace. I agree with everything Steve Gold mentioned. They Sold Out, plain and simple.btw, What's up with ""Innocent""? Could it be anymore of a P.O.D ""Youth of the Nation"" [spin] off? I mean, look at it..- the first verse about a boy named Jonny- the second verse about a hurting little girl- the chorus chanting the same words ""we are, we are all innocent""; to P.O.D's ""we are, we are the youth of the Nation""- the bridge about how we need to change..- and the final chorus with the kids singing.*Shakes head sadly*"
1,ew,"before this album came out, i was siked and looking forward to it. once i bought the album, i was extremely disappointed. our lady peace WAS my absolute favorite band. one of the reasons was because they didn't sound like anyone else. i own every single album that they came out with. they were brilliant when they had lead guitarist, mike. as soon as he quit the band and they gained the ""new guy"", our lady peace sounds like everyone else. it [is bad]. if you admire our lady peace's old stuff for what it is worth, you will not buy this album."
1,The band isn't the same since Mike Turner's departure,"I wholly agree with the first review posted. OLP used to be a wonderfully talented band, but when they ventured out in to the land of commerical success, their music lost something. Much of this has to do with integral member, Mike Turner (guitars), departing after the release of Spiritual Machines, the predecessor to Gravity. Turner did not like the direction the band was headed in, and for good reason. OLP was better when they were less about commerically sound, catchy tunes and more about writing interesting, eclectic songs, with crafty guitar work. Many of these aspects, most notably the good guitars, are not to be found on this latest album. I had been a fan since 1994's Naveed, their first album, but I am a fan no longer. OLP has sold out, and they will never be the same."
3,It's fine I suppose.,"honestly, i'm a huge fan of OLP. i go to the shows and buy all the albums and enjoy every minute of it. now, by no means is this the worst OLP album. naveed, let's face it, totally [stinks]. however, this is extremely easily the second worst. about 4 of the songs are super mediocre, very odd for this band. there is really only one impressive track on this, being innocent. everything else sounds like everything on the radio. really, this record didn't need to be made. i could have lived without these songs. they're not that great. i can't say that for the past three albums. compared to spiritual machines, this is complete garbage. i know what OLP is capable of and this doesnt even come close. if you're a fan of radio music that sounds exactly the same as everything else, enjoy. if not, you'll live without it."
1,Bleh,"For everyone that is this far into wanting to build a honda, this book doesnt have anything you don't aready know. The main theme of the book (dyno charts) might appear to add to the appeal of this book, but the methods used to demonstrate hp gains are correlated in a rather sloppy manner and do not follow any consistant methods of comparison (e.g. stock setup vs. specific bolt on only). The only situation where i would recommend this book is if you are literally 100% new to the tuning scene. If you are already familiar with the very simple bolt ons and how it affects the engine, then this books is a total waste of time and money."
1,If This Is Eric Burdon -- Then I am Maria Callas,"Don't buy this one! The music is amateurish, the voice does not even come close to that of the great Eric Burdon. I suspect this is kind of a tribute to Eric Burdon release disguised as the real thing.If you know the original songs, you will cry bitter tears listening to this compilation of bloodless and dilettantish covers.The worst cut, in my opinion, ""When I Was Young.""Not even worth the postage."
1,The DVD is not complete! Cuts off the best moment on Teen Mom 2!,"Teen Mom and Teen Mom 2 have a huge problem with their DVDs. Whenever an episode runs more than the standard one hour (about 40 minutes without commercials) the DVDs cut that episode short. The Teen Mom 2 Season 1 DVDs cut the episode where Leah and Corey marry, cutting out the entire wedding, which for many was the highlight of this season, if not all of Teen Mom 2! This continues to happen with Teen Mom/Teen Mom 2 DVDs. The final season of Teen Mom was recently released on DVD and the final episode of Teen Mom ""Wake Up"", which was an extra long episode, was cut. Only the first 40 or so minutes is shown on the DVD set, despite it being a 90 minute episode. MTV/Teen Mom really need to fix this issue with the DVDs. Majorly disappointed!"
3,confused,i was watching the last episode and i cant find where cory and leahs wedding is it just went to the finale special with dr drew which was weird
4,Good for fans,"This DVD set is a good addition to any Muse fan's collection. That said, this isn't as well done as the concert on the HAARP set. However, it is interesting to compare the two and see what great leaps Muse has made in terms of fan base, style, presentation, and all-around pinache.The direction of the concert is good, but not great. It's quick cuts and fast paced ""action sequences"" try to keep in the spirit of the music, but would probably be better suited to a hardcore metal band like Slipknot. The extreme close-ups are something you will love or hate. How close to Bellamy's nostrils do you want to get? That is up to you as a fan.One note of caution in buying this dvd here: it is listed as all-region and it is actually Region 9. Therefore, Americans may not be able to watch it on their standard dvd player. It will play in DVD-ROM drives for computers and if you happen to have an all-region dvd player (which are not easily found)."
5,Excellent... but beware!,"I love Muse, but this is not an all regions DVD. I contacted the seller and they stated ""That is an error on the Amazon site, as this item is available as import only and does not exist in the NTSC format. You will need an all region DVD player or computer with DVD ROM drive to view.""It does NOT work on my PS3 or standard DVD player, but does work on my XBOX 360. Other than that, it's AWESOME!!!"
2,Limited viewing!!,"There is no mention of restricted viewing for the U.S. I was not able to view this DVD on my DVD player-a message saying my area prohibits the viewing of this DVD. But, I was able to view it on my laptop. But,it's still abit inconvenient. And, I wished there was a warning of this possible occurence-I may not have purchased it had I known."
3,"Even ""okay"" is good enough","I bought this for my Muse-fanatic wife and watched it with her as soon as it arrived. Though not nearly as good as the live HAARP DVD, it's still fun to watch Hullabaloo to catch a few more Muse tunes performed live. Musically, Muse lives up to their press as a sonically stellar live band. Visually, however, the video gets annoying to watch at times because they appear to live by the motto ""let's see how many different camera shots we can squeeze into every song"". So you really never get the sense you're actually at the concert the way you do with the HAARP dvd where you get a lot of time to watch the guys do their thing. My other complaint would be that we couldn't get the DVD to play on any of our DVD players and can only watch it on our computer. It must have something to do with the formatting and perhaps I missed the warning somewhere when I was ordering it. Still, it's Muse, and I guess even an ""Okay"" dvd is good enough with Muse -according to the wife."
3,Half a big deal,A b-sides disc that has its share of winners partnered with the band's assuredly blistering live work ensures an enticing fan-based compilation.
5,This is a B-Side album?!?!,"Let's start off by saying Muse is the greatest thing to hit the music industry since Pink Floyd, and noone in America has heard of them lol.When I first heard this album was full of B-sides, I was skeptical to buy it. I spent the money and listened to it. This album was unbelievable. It starts out with a very eerie song in ""Forced In"", and closes with arguably their best song in ""Hyper Chondriac Music"". Th songs in between do not disappoint at all either.Def. worth the money for such an incredible album."
4,WHOA!!!,"I can`t believe that this is a album with b-sides.Here is another album that makes muse the best band in the world.The songs on Hullabaloo is not as good as the songs on Origin of Symmetry or Showbiz, but they are too good to be b-sides. If you are a fan of muse, get this album."
1,Lifetime,I have this DVD player. I have used it almost every day and it does not work anymore. I have had it for a little over a year. If you want a DVD player that lasts do not buy this one.
2,Disappointment due to frame freeze,"I have had this player for about two weeks now - I am extremely disappointed with the performance. The first night that we used the player, about two hours into play I experienced numerous frame freezes, which interrupted not only my video, but also the audio. I thought it might be the DVD until I tried a second DVD and had the same problem. I truly expected more from General Electric in quality and performance. I would not recommend the purchase of this player to anyone."
2,huge dissapointment after 10 months of use,"Yes, it does glitch a little.Yes, the price is right.No, it won't last forever. I just got The Godfather DVD Collection, and after 1 hour play on EACH disc, the player froze. Strange, since the discs work just fine in my iBook.The problem is that now I can't watch any of my movies, it glitches more than it used to, and on most of my discs it freezes.I guess I'll have to spend a little more, but get a first quality SONY or Panasonic Player.... maybe a PIONEER."
2,Don't even think about getting this dvd player,"I got this player as a Christmas gift and it was running fine on some of my movies but it would freeze on others. Finally, it quit after running Monsters Inc. Now none of my movies play and getting decent customer service form Thomson is a joke. I still don't have the answers I need and all they want is a credit card # for a replacement with no guarantees of this not happening again. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this player."
3,A brief look at Washington,"This is not one of Edmund Morgan's more important books, but it is worth looking at if you like Morgan's writings (as I do passionately), or if you are a George Washington buff. This is a very slim volume, consisting of one very interesting lecture on Washington as a military and political leader (arguing that Washington understood the nature of power better than anybody else in his day in the colonies or the states), and a selection of Washington's letters that provide corroboration for Morgan's arguments and insight into the pertinent topics. Where needed, Morgan provides a brief introduction to each letter. I enjoyed it, but it isn't going to make anybody outside of the two groups I mentioned above very happy."
4,"Clean, undamaged, well packed, classic.","Most medical experts in this modern age will argue in their snobbery that this classic version of ""Gray's Anatomy"" is out dated and in need of revision. This Barnes and Noble classic text is the original, moderately revised version which does not compare to most modern methods of study, however, it is a beautiful epitome of the human's ability to advance in so little time. Although it's not a modern, revised version, it still does the trick. As a physician myself, I would completely recommend this version to any student of medicine or enthusiast."
5,very interesting read,Great book. I am so happy to have this special book to my medically collection.Rviews were spot on. Hoppe you enjoy you'r too.
5,Time enduring classic,"This title is essential for anyone studying anatomy, it is in depth, so perhaps on its own it is too ""heavy"", but complimented with an atlas is is perfect. As a med student i loved it, and really used during my entire schooling, and kept on using it during internship and residency."
2,Reprint of Old Edition,"I own the book with this ISBN and it is a Barnes and Noble exact reprint of the Henry Gray F.R.S.(!) Anatomy of 1901.It is the 15th edition printed originally in 1901.There are no photos only black and white drawings(19th century style) and lots of writing ,much more writing than illustrations."
5,good,great for medical students ^^ very pretty pictures and great wording if you are going into the medical field it is a must have ^^
3,"Not current, and neither are some of the reviews","The current edition (8/08) is the 39th published in 2004, there are British and American versions which differ slightly in terminology.The 40th edition will be published at the end of September 2008. So if you are looking for the current text book then order either the 39th or 40th."
2,Definitely used,You can tell by the cover that this is a used book but the price was right and the shipping was fast.
2,Beware! This Edition May be over 100 Years Old!,"I am now speaking to you as an anatomist and as a professor of human gross anatomy -- Student Beware. This is not the book that you think it is.Look carefully. Gray's Anatomy currently comes in two english editions. The British Version (now in its 39th edition) retails for about... The American Version (now in its 30th edition) retails for about ... If the edition you are looking at costs considerably less than those prices ASK YOURSELF WHY!. You are probably considering the ""classic collectors edition"" which is a reprint of the 1901 American Edition. There is nothing wrong with that edition, if you are interested in the history of science. However, much of the terminology has changed and in 100 years we have developed a much deeper understanding of human anatomy.Know what you are buying. If you are a serious student of anatomy, you probably do not want this to be your first (or only) edition of Gray's Anatomy."
5,As good as you have heard.,"Gray's Anatomy is a ""classic"" book on Anatomy. Unusual for a classic, it is everything you have heard. The drawings are beautiful, accurate, and interesting. At the same time, this book was a standard text for Anatomy since 1901. As such, the drawing are only part of this book. The book's main effort is to explanation human anatomy. It does so wonderfully and clearly, with words. The drawings are only there to help with the text's explanations.A quick warning. Since this book has been around since before 1901, there are many, many different versions. Make sure you check the printing date of the one you buy. The human body has not changed since this first editions, but our access to it has. As such, while some of the earlier books are beautiful to look at, the later editions are more valuable as a reference tool."
2,slight disappointment,"I was hoping for more images and pictures based on the description of this product. I recieved the book and it was very light in weight, felt like I purchased a paperback....even though it is hard cover....the quality of paper and print is not of a collectors edition for the typical collector."
2,BAD QUALITY GRAPHICS,"I thought this version was different from the original one (The Classic Collector's edition), with more pictures. IT IS the same text and images. On top of that the pictures are worse quality, bad grey scale and sometimes difficult to read names in pictures. The contents is ok."
1,Never recieved PRODUCT,I ordered this in Mid December and have yet to recieve this product. I ordered this as a Christmas gift and left the seller know that is wasn't recieved and she assured me that she would take care of it and find out what happened but still haven't heard anything else from her or recieved my product which has already been paid for! I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
4,A good bookshelf piece,"Personally, I never opened the book while taking anatomy in order to study. The book is as detailed as can be so it has a lot of extraneous info that med students don't need. However, it is the traditional bookshelf piece for med students."
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed or misled about the condition of this bood. It is a good book but the cover is detached from it
2,A giant messy book,"This giant messy book is written in very grotesc language. Many ""americanized"" special words which are in use in the modern medicine, are written in their Latin analog. Just break a teeth. Not mentioning the didactic structure - it is awful."
5,A Very Beautiful And Warm Christmas Offering,"While to a certain degree, I would say that it would have been nicer if JOHNNY MATHIS had recorded most/all these songs uniquely here as TONY BENNETT did on his christmas video back in the mid-1990's (A FAMILY CHRISTMAS), this is still a big 'five' star DVD and the lyp-synching really doesn't get in the way. With many of these songs having actually been recorded back in the late 1950's, you get that old christmas 'crooner'sound that you hardly get nowadays in christmas music.Wonderful versions of songs such as I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS (perhaps the best version of the song ever), TOYLAND, IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE CHRISTMAS, and every single other song and along with wonderful christmas scenery throughout with JOHNNY and others presenting different aspects of christmas, you'll be in for a very beautiful and warm christmas treat that is great for you and your household.Highly recommended."
5,Thank you,Was a gift. I didn't watch it but it came on time an good shape. Thank you again. right on the money.
5,Great video.,Great selection of songs sung by a great singer. The settings for the music puts you in the Christmas spirit. Johnny Mathis comes across as a real gentleman who truly believes in Christmas.
4,"Such a great concert, but...","This is truly a wonderful concert, and Johnny Mathis is at his best! The special features are great and include a tour of his LA home. However, the quality of the video is poor. We originally saw this concert on PBS, and it was much sharper and of higher quality. Not sure why this is the case, but for that, I'm disappointed. The four stars are for Johnny himself--well, he gets five, but the video quality takes away a star."
1,Euro 2012 dvd,Doesn't work on Australian DVD players. Cant watch it. The DVD is not PAL version so it will not work on latest Samsung Blu ray players
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"I've owned this collection since 1991 and to this day it's become an absolute reference for me, constantly being played over and over again. Pavarotti at his very best! A very complete and representative collection of tenor songs, oratorio and opera arias in a 2CD presentation."
3,Just OK...not great.,"We purchased these to communicate between our two vehicles during a recent long-distance move. They worked ok, although the 20-mile claim is bogus. You'd be lucky to be able to pick up the other radio at any distance over a mile. Also, if you're planning on using them in an urban area, be prepared to share the airwaves with a lot of other people. Even in smallish cities like Missoula, MT, we had a hard time finding a clear channel.The batteries didn't hold their charge as long as we were hoping, either. By hour four of the drive each day we had to turn the radios off for short periods of time in order to ensure that we had some juice left for the tricky sections later on. Kept on at all times with normal use I would estimate you have about three to five hours of charge in the batteries.Never did figure out how to use the NOAA alert thingy. Overall a mediocre product. It worked well for our trip (except for the battery thing), but wouldn't really want to use them for much else."
2,20 mile - misleading,"This radio set gets the job done for what I needed it for, I mainly use this for MTB and skiing to get contact with the folks I'm with. The 20 mile range is misleading as its only good if there's nothing between you and the other person, trees, cars and inside abuilding can distort the radio's abiliy to receive/transmit. I still use this set (2 yrs) up to this day, had to replace the rechargeable batteries within a year. Not recommended for long range use."
3,Range not as great as stated,"These worked decently, but the effective range was quite a bit lower than stated range. Also, unless you regularly discharge and recharge the batteries with frequent use, they die and need to be replaced.Ended up giving them to a kid I know as a gift, he'll get more use out of them than I was."
3,Rather disappointing,"After Tidewater Blood, the first of William Hoffman's novels I read, I was primed to enjoy this new one. Sadly, Blood And Guile suffers from a too-languid pace that detracts from the plot line. The primary character, Walter Frampton, who stood as a fine piece of believable characterization in the previous book, comes across here as ineffectual, even dull in a doomed-romantic fashion. It's a pity, because this tale of a supposed hunting accident has possibilities that are never fully realized-all as a result of Frampton's failure to step off the pages as he did so compellingly in Tidewater Blood. Certainly, Blood And Guile is worth reading, but it's just not on the same level as the preceding book."
4,nunquam trado,"a level headed lawyer and his boyhood blood brothers go grouse hunting with a fundamentalist landowner who winds up shot dead. Pacing is deliberate, tone is southern colloquial. rich in setting and atmosphere."
1,Altus Nylon head harness,"The harness sets too high on my head, should slide down further but the design keeps it up close to sliding off the top of your head. I used another at physical therapy that I ordered next. Should have ordered it in the first place"
3,A good guess,"A good piece of haunting guitar work. I will get another of his albums in the future. An ending or two is a bit odd, but the body of the songs are great."
1,Tedious Read,"To finish this book is an extremely tedious task. Peter Kerr writes about his life in Mallorca, having moved from Scotland to get a taste of a more idyllic lifestyle and away from the rat race. Except for the occasional familiar Spanish expressions and terms, this book tries to emulate the style of Peter Mayle's hugely successful and popular series on Provence. In my humble opinion, it failed quite badly. Peter Kerr tried to describe very minute details which may not interest readers. He tried to be humurous- marginally successful at times. If you want a good read of life in a foreign countryside, pick up Peter Mayle's A Year in Provence, anytime. I may have been biased and it could be possible that I may like Peter Kerr's books on Mallorca had I begun with his first book on Mallorcan winter. Sometimes, the first book of a series is usually the best and as the series progresses, the author suffers from fatigue. So do readers."
1,Not even close to being as good as you heard,"Most people will probably hate me for writing this review about a classic, but I found Pride and Prejudice a terrible bore. Everyone knows what it's about, so I won't use up my time telling you. But the book is really sort of a nightmare that never ends. It is not romantic or charming in the least bit. The main character comes through as arrogant and at times even stupid. It is a completely forgetable book, and I have no clue as to why so many people find it romantic. The writing is good, it has it's moments, but it in no way makes up for this book's lack of everything else. Wuthering Heights and Little Women, other classics that are just about in the same genre, are by far superior. I was so disappointed I have not read another book by Austen, and I'm not planning on it."
1,I just don't see it,"I have wanted to read this novel for a long time because of all the great reviews. Finally I had the chance to read it and personally I am disgusted. I tried really hard to see what people love about the book. I cannot see it. There is no true love in the book, the characters are shallow and there is absolutely no story. It talks through the entire book of these five sisters marrying. I think that they are al pompous and rather annoying. I do have to say that Elizabeth is my favorite character as she doesn't seem to be as sucked in to the society nearly as much, but I do not see what there is in this book that has given it all the wonderful reviews. Though I do encourage all to reaad it and see for themselves what it is like. From the reviews people either LOVE it or HATE it there are no in-betweens. Good-luck to all I hope you see more than I did."
3,Good book but look out for translation,"This book is a classic. I decided to order it to add to my library. When I received the book, I realized it was unabridged meaning everything is a literal translation. I would recommend getting a version that makes sense of the sentences. Otherwise, a good book to read - one that everyone must read at least once in their lifetime."
1,Gimme a break...,"This is without question the worst book I've ever read in my entire life. The style is clumsy though the author strives to impress with an aristocratic pompousness so typical of social climbers of her day. The characters are cold, their development dull and boring and Austen's every attempt to portray the most basic of human relationships falls well short, getting completely tangled in ridiculously elite language that was in its day and remains still completely outdated. Commoners did not speak like that then, nor do they now. I would rather endure a daily root canal than read this book again. It was almost as inspirational as witnessing a mountain top removal to mine coal. It doesn't surprise me that her original manuscript was rejected as it should have been and now I wonder to what extent politics played a role in her eventual success? Perhaps zero of five stars would be more accurate..."
4,Pride and Prejudice,It is an interesting novel written 200 years ago but still in vogue.I don't know anybody else I could recommend it.
5,"I have 2 favorite books, this being one of them.","Jane Austen has a wonderful style of writing. She has written many wonderful novels, this being the best. 5 girls out with thier mother insisting they find a husband. The oldest falls in love, only to find that his sister and his friend are out to keep them apart. But the real dilema however is when Lizzy finds herself in love with the nastiest, most proud man she has ever met. Go and read this wonderful novel the first chance you get."
2,Cardboard characters,"I have read this book a number of times, and tried to like it; but; the characters lack depth. Lizzy, and to an extent Charlotte are the only two who are 3D. Jane Austen`s ideas of poverty are laughable, large house complete with servants is not poor. Mr.Darcy great on video but passionless in the text."
2,Redundant!,"This was indeed one of the most foolish novels I have ever read. I found the conflict boring and without point, and the theme horribly expressed (was there any at all). Such that I find it amazing that the behaviors of an aristocratic woman in the 19th century wound actually be of interest to ANYONE. The themes are indeed NOT universal, and if anything, it should be derived from simple everyday life - there is no need to write a book about it. The infamous character portrayals seem hugely worthless. Such a book is suited at best for the coffee table. Two stars because I never had the energy to finish the entire book, so I might have missed the so called ""good parts"" of it."
4,Very nice,"Starts off very slow, but comes into its own near the last 100 pages. Great read. I'll definitely be looking into more Jane Austen books."
2,review of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin,"I got what I paid for. I paid zero and I got a story written about 200 years ago. Pride and Prejudice is about a poor girl and a rich english noble. Not much of a plot, Will the girl become a princess? I do read love stories but they should have a interesting story plot.lee sullivan"
4,Pride and Prejudice,This book is still relevant in the world of today. The characters remind me of people I know. I liked it.
3,Pleasant book,"This is a pleasant classic with a wonderful story. The book was at times difficult to understand; however, I especially enjoyed the mother character."
3,Pride and Prejudice,"For the first time ever, I liked the movie (w/Colin Firth version) way better than the book."
3,"Beautiful cover, old content pages","I'm not really qualified enough to give the comments for this wonderful classic book. What I can give is the comments on the physical outlook of the book.Beautiful cover, old content pages, wonderful old book renouveau!"
3,Awesome book,"I found this book to be a great one of the many that I have every read. It is now within my memory, and I will most definetly read again. It may be long, but it is definetly worth it. I love the way that Lizzy thinks and acts. Throughout the book you are triggered into seeing if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are ever gonna get hooked up. The thought of Jane always being there for her sister is also a very good necessityof the book. It shows how decent people can actually be and the relationship that 2 sisters can often have. I encourage you to read it and find out how good a book it is for yourself!"
3,interesting and lively,great book - i love mr.bennet's attitude towards his wife. darcy is a fine gentleman. i'd love to meet another 'darcy' in real life!
3,a very descriptive book .,i think that this book was a very descriptive book that had some good points but also had some bad points. i read this book for a class and i had some trouble reading it because it got kind of boring at times. overall though it was a very well writen book by jane austen. i would recommend it to those who enjoy reading books that contain alot of detail.
4,Pride and Predjudice,This is probably the most well known of all Jane Austen's work and I'd never read it before my class assigned it. I'm so happy to now own it on my ipod!
3,A good read,I enjoyed the story. Very interesting as how women where suppose to behave. I'm glad we've as women have evolved.
1,Cd's would not play in 2 different cd players.,I love this audio version of Pride and Prejudice but the Cd's would not play. I went ahead and purchased the MP3 formatted cd and now listen to it on our mp3 player. Waste of time and money for the cd's.
3,pretty gud...,well according 2 me this only a pretty gud book. it is hard 2 get in 2 n is actually kinda boring. though u might like it if u like 2 read about da older days in england. in this book a rich guy moves in town n a girl name jane falls in lovve wth him. but thx 2 his little sister they move away n well... elizabeth (janes younger sister) is proposed by a guy who is 1 of da reasons y da guy that jane loved moved away.... this isnt that bad of a book it just takes a while 2 get in...
2,Pride and Prejudice,"Pride and Prejudice is a story on how one family of five girls try to fall in love all in one year. Drama starts when the young Elizabeth Bennett crosses upon a gentlemen by the name of Mr. Darcy who soon falls madly in love with her. While thats going on, Elizabeths older sister, Jane has fallen in love with Mr. Bingley, the ""new neighbor"" in their town. This book is full of love triangles, gossip and old fashion ""love talk"".I don't really like this book because, it was hard to follow because the wording was dated far back. There are also too many conversations going on in just one page! I would reccomend this book to adults and teenagers above the age of 15. If you don't like romance novels, don't even dare to pick up this book.I still think Jane Austen is a good author. She demonstrates a lot of personality in one person and sometimes it feels like you were almost in the book."
1,BEWARE!,"People who order this cassette should be wary! In order to ""save space,"" the publisher, Brilliance Company, has recorded the tape twice on each side, requiring special equipment in order to descramble it when listening to it on a Walkman-type casset player. The equipment goes under the name of ""Bookcassette Adapter,"" and there is no indication how to get hold of one. If you want to hear it on a standard tape deck, make sure your deck is stereo with a balance control knob. Otherwise you have the dubious pleasure of hearing two tracks of reading simultaneously. Best to simply choose another version of ""Pride and Prejudice."""
5,A classic!,"""Pride and Prejudice"" is a wonderful look at the customs of marriage, love, and financial and social status in Regency England. It's message, that love is more important than financial gain, and that first impressions aren't always the best to base attitudes on, still ring true centuries later."
5,must read,a book everyone should read if they havent. A love story anyone would enjoy. Plus Jane Austen wrote it enough said
5,A amazing novel,I absolutely love this book!I rate this book as follows:Love interest: 5Subcharacters: 5Writing: 5Romantic Plot: 5Overall: 5
5,"Screw the errors, this book is amazing.","I read the bad review which were generally about the errors in this version. Any errors aside, this book is incredible, one of my favorite books of all time. Readers will fall in love with Elizabeth Bennet, a young girl with a big personality and an insufferable family who learns that love can mean learning to accept the person you choose, flaws and all. If you are a fan of subtle romance novels that are well written and hold messages about the nature of mankind, then Pride and Prejudice is the novel for you."
5,Masterpiece must read,"""Pride & Prejudice"" is without doubt a masterpiece of English literature. This funny, engaging and extraordinarily well-written work of classic fiction not only entertains and enchants, but also gives a glimpse into a very different time, that on closer inspection isn't very foreign at all. If you have not read this book (or if you only remember it from being compelled to read it in school) I cannot more heartily recommend picking up this free ebook and giving Austen a chance!"
5,Pride and Prejudice,"I have read this book in the hard cover many times and watched the series many times as well. Reading on my new kindly was simply a delicious experience again. I can almost quote dialogue but still am totally absorbed by the plot/s each time. The selection of language used throughout the book is superb and sometimes makes me think I wish we still spoke that way. Shame so much swearing and slang has entered our english language, that maybe high school students should read it to learn a new selection of words, or to have it reinforced that there are thousands of delicious words out there that far create more meaning than slang! A classic and always will be."
4,pride and prejudice,"Romantic. I started wishing i had lived during that time. This book started my fascination with the classics. Now, i cant stop reading them."
4,"Good book, but more for women","I can understand why this is considered a classic of literature. I saw the movie first and then just read it. The story is more for women, I think, but I confess I got into the drama once Darcy and Elizabeth started interacting. I could have done without some (or all) of the sisters, but I guess they were an essential part of the novel to show what silly girls were like in those days."
5,Worth paying for on the Kindle,"Kindle owners hopefully are aware of the wealth of free editions of the classics which are available through Feedbooks and other sources.I obtained a copy of P&P; from feedbooks originally and while it was easy to get and the price was right, the overall quality of the text is not great. I've found several typos, presumably the result of OCR errors and it's somewhat distracting.Since P&P; is one of my wife's favorite books, I was delighted to seePenguin had released an electronic edition for $0.50 complete with the usual footnotes, essays and maps that one's used tofinding in textbook editions of the classics.The table of contents is pretty minimal. The headings include the editor's material, and the three volume headings."
5,Pride and Prejudice,This book gets better with time. I love sinking into the old world customs and imagine myself without phone and just pen and paper for communication.
3,Struck by similarities,"This is a classic I never read before, but the Kindle price was certainly right. I enjoyed it, but as much for the history of English law regarding estates as for character development and plot. I was struck by the similarities between Pride and Prejudice and PBS' series Downton Abbey--same issues regarding inheritance of a major estate when all the children are daughters, the role of a male relative, the ambiguous relationship between the male and female protagonists, etc."
4,Loved it,"The language is at times hard to follow, but the book is wonderful! Beautiful classic love story with a great ending."
1,hard returns still in place on my purchase,I purchased this edition of Pride and Prejudice based on the assurance that the hard returns in the edition had been fixed. This is not the case - every sentence has a hard return - a large space or gap between it and the next sentence. It is quite annoying to read and I will be tossing it off my kindle and going with another version. My first kindle disappointment.
4,A Classic Tale,"For those who love the stories we read as children, now you can have the digital version as well! A Classic that is great both in paper and digital form."
4,Classic,If you like romantic classics you do not need my advice...if not do not read this book! I enjoyed it very much!
5,Classic book,"I needed a version of Pride and Prejudice for school -- ample margin room for notes, sturdy binding, just-right size, cheap price. This was it. If you want to buy a new version of this classic book, I'd highly recommend this."
5,Superbly Crafted,"Each time my daughter and I read this novel, we discover more evidence of what an exquisite blend of entertainment and precision it is. Austen simultaneously captivates the casual reader with a page-turner, while amazing the serious reader with her knack for meticulously echoing earlier details when elaboorating on them in later pages."
3,A Classic,"I remember liking Sense and Sensibility in college, but I struggled through this one a bit. It took me about half the book just to get used to the language, but once I did, it was mildly enjoyable. The Bennet family drove me a little crazy, especially Mrs. Bennet and Lydia. But I loved the evolution of Lizzy's feelings for Darcy and the conclusion of the ""happily ever after"" marriages. I don't think I'm up for the challenge of Jane Austen again any time soon, but I'm glad I read this classic."
5,Very interesting story,I didn't remember reading this in school so I thought I'd give a try. It was free with my Kindle app. I thoroughly enjoyed it. A very sweet story that had you hoping for a happy ending.
5,A Classic!,"Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful work. It is actually quite hilarious at times, especially when looking at it through the lens of today. A good read for all!"
4,Enjoyable look into 19th century England,I read this book in high school and enjoyed is somewhat. Recently I read it again and was far more impressed. It gives a great description of the period (19th century) and Austen's character development is wonderful. There are many lines often quoted today and many miss out because they never read the book. Her humor is subtle but witty. It's doesn't have the action of many books today but it is relaxing reading.The Kindle version of the book is good. It is clear and easy to read with good navigation (for a Kindle).
4,Great book...,"I had wanted to read this book for quite some time now, and I'm glad I finally got the chance to. It is a good piece, which I very much enjoyed. For me, it didn't totally live up to my expectations of it, but I found it very enjoyable to read. And I can't wait to read more of Jane Austen's books..."
5,A Very Good Book,"This book is about the Bennett family. Mr. and Mrs. Bennett have 5 daughters. Jane, the oldest daughter, is interested in Mr. Bingley.The 2nd oldest daughter, Elizabeth, has a suitor of her own, Mr. Darcy. She is not impressed with him especially with the fact he tried to break up Jane and Mr. Bingley. This is an extremely good book because it is well written and keeps you guessing about who will end up with who. I loved this book. It is a definite must read."
3,An Old Masterpiece,"I chose this book because of the author's fame but found I could not relate to it just now. I will try to read this book again, later."
5,The kind of book you must own,"One never gets tired of reading Pride and Prejudice. I cannot remember how many times I have read it, but each time I do I enjoy it more and more. Jane Austen's Books never cease to take you back to a time when people cared about good manners, and people were expected to behave politely. Of course, the emphasis placed on marrying based almost exclusively on material things shows us what a long way we have come in some respects, but how little we have changed in others. Ultimately, this story is one about the triumph of true love despite obstacles, and is timeless in that sense."
3,"legendary novel, but....","It's a legendary and outstanding claasic but let's discuss not the novel itself but the book and it's quality. The cover is very nice, but the pages inside are of very poor quality.... If I had known it would be that kind of, I would definitely buy a better edition.... Though observing it's low prince, I should have had more or less clue about the quality of the book... Once again I confirm that nobody argues about the novel which is really remarkable piece of work..."
5,Pride and Prejudice,"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a great example of life in late 18th century England that depicts the struggles of women competing in a society dominated by men. Her main character, Elizabeth Bennet, portrays an independent, headstrong women acting out against her duty as a woman to get married in a time where men are the dominant sex. Her eventual love with Mr. Darcy creates a novel that is both humerous and romantic. I highly reccomend reading this classic novel by Jane Austen."
3,An ok book,I read this book and got bored with it after page 35 it was confusing overall I didn't like it
3,"Classic, but not a must...","Overall, this novel was a good read. However, it lulled in many places and a lot of determination was required to finish this novel. I am pleased I did though, as the ending was very well written and the portrayal of characters by Austen (particularly Elizabeth and Darcy) were very captivating - but not on a level with Dickens.As I suggested to a friend, this novel is a classic, by all means read it. However, don't be in a hurry to do so and if you never get round to it, oh well!"
2,Sheer torture,"I shouldn't be writing this, as I am apparently missing something in this book. Jane Austen was obviously an intelligent lady, had great facility with the language, was able to make keen observations, and had a good soul. But reading this was an exercise in grim duty. I could not have cared less about any of the characters or the outcome of the ""plot."" The one character with any potential of interest was Darcy, and he turned out to be a very dull boy. This seems to be the 19th century version of today's romance novel, written for a certain audience. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose, but I would rather even read Russian novels of the same century--another literary torture chamber, but a more interesting one."
2,Very bland and dry,"I am sorry, I know that this book is loved by millions and I should love it; but, I do not. I just could not get into it. It is so bland that I could not even finish. Thank the stars for cliff notes."
3,Not a perfect cut,"I haven't read the book yet but what I wanna say is the book is too new and they were in a hurry of making or cutting this book which is result unsqare or imperfect cut.The letters don't look straight and lean to the right then left when you turn to the next page. It's quite funny and make me a little unhappy about it.Anyhow, I'm sure the story is as sweet as it has been. But next time, check your book shape!"
2,Good,Sometimes the language was hard to understand but it helped to understand the movie better by reading the book. Enjoyed the book
3,predicatable but good,"Seeing Lizzie struggle with herself and others was well done. Mr. Darcy seemed too cruel to suddenly be so nice. But he was trying to NOT love Lizzie. Fun story, everything tied up in a pretty ribbon in the end."
3,I liked the movie better,This is one of those weird occasions where I actually prefer the movie (the one staring Keira Knightly). I guess she seemed a too dumb for me in the book. But I did like all the details the movie left out
3,Not a real kindle edition.,I was wholly engrossed by the novel. But this particular version of the book purchased for kindle is really bad. Text at some pages are not aligned. It was similar to reading a PDF in kindle. Better to read the book through PDF.
5,I could read Pride and Prejudice again and again.,I could read Pride and Prejudice again and again and still enjoy every page. A true classic to be enjoyed
5,Pride and Prejudice,"I have read a lot of different books. This is my all time favorite, I have read it several times in just a few months."
5,The True Romance,"This is my favorite book ever. I have read it many times, four to be exact. Jane Austen is so witty and does a great job at telling this love story. As you read you begin to really know the characters. You begin to relate to their fears and desires. It takes great story telling to bring characters to life. Every lady who reads this book will dream of their Darcy...will wish that they were Elizabeth. No one can escape the enchantment of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."
3,Wordy,"I like that it fills in some of the spots you wonder about when reading the original...but, whew, it does go on at times. I find I keep hitting the seek button. The woman reading has a great voice and I enjoy listening to her."
4,"Excellent Novel, Shrill Recording","I love Jane Austen's classic novel. I listened to this version while commuting to work, and while I enjoyed the narration, at times the voicing is shrill. I found I had to adjust the volume more often than with other audiobooks."
2,Ugh Jane Austen,"Even if one considers Pride and Prejudice to be a cautionary tale for men to avoid getting caught up in the affairs of women, or with recognition that Austen is truly showing that women have an amazing ability to manipulate men and essentially control their world, one cannot overlook the sheer boredom that reading Pride and Prejudice creates. Set this one aside and pick up The Scarlet Letter if you are looking for a classic worth reading."
2,Negative,"I have been reading classics, but this did not rate for me. I read half and stopped. I found it extremely boring, the descriptions went on and on, and the book was hard to read."
2,"A classic, but it bored me","I had seen the films, and knew what was going to happen. This may be part of what bored me about the book, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish it-- I don't normally quit reading a book either."
3,This is a Mediocre Book at Best,"The plot is good...but they don't tell you what each character is thinking, the don't give you an insight into each person real personality"
4,Timeless,A classic book that everyone should take the time to read. Have to get used to the different ideas & manner of speaking but was very heartwarming.
2,Lots of typos,The book is very good (of course! A classic!) Jane Austen is always a great reading.But this book has a lot of typos. I bought the kindle version and the typos were annoying.
2,"Great book, bad ebook","I started reading this Kindle edition today and was very put off by the ALL CAPS used for emphasis. There's a version of all Jane Austen's books for $1.99, so I bought that and will delete this one. The other version has no formatting for the emphasized words (italics would be good), but better than those all caps that make it feel like I'm reading Price & Prejudice via facebook."
5,Excellent Purchase!,Purchased this book as one of my daughter's Christmas gifts. It was a huge hit...she just loved it. The book arrived on time and in perfect condition!
3,Love-Story,I liked the book because it shows how love can turn sour sometimes and how feelings can change. But there are so many names in the book that you have to keep checking who is who. Sometimes difficult words are used so I had to look them up in a dictionary. After reading I thing the book represents true facts mixed with fantasy.Andrea Dreier E8/I
1,Hated it !!,I really didn't like this book because it was in the old times and I didn't understand it so yea :)
5,Mr. Darcy is a weird guy.,i thought it was a wonderful and Romantic book. i like that Elizabeth is so headstrong and knows how to express her feelings toward mr. darcy. It shows him that she is no prize. She is a humben as well as him I will denfely will read it again. But I will read the longer fervesion this time seen I like it so will I thought that the pictures were great in my book. Jane austen is a great writer.
2,Hortizontal Print,I missed if the product description said it was printed on the horizontal instead of the usual vertical. Too weird for me. I returned it.
5,Wonderful and Addicting,"I admit that when I first heard this story, I was confused by the fast pace. I watch the old movie before reading the book, so I knew what was going to happen. I heard it over again and enjoyed it a lot. Since then I've listened to it many many times. Though the reader is fast paced, I like her different voices for each character.This book is about a 20-year-old woman named Eliza. She lives with her 1 older sister and 3 younger sisters and mother and father in a small village. A new arrival comes to the town. A man named Bingley. He brings his friend Mr. Darcy and his sisters Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. Eliza's older sister Jane admires Mr. Bingley. But Eliza finds Mr. Darcy a very proud and rude man. She meets another man who catches her fancy.I recommend not reading this book once or twice, but a lot. Then you can really get the feel for what Jane Austen was writing. For me it was a lot more interesting in a fast pace listening then a slow read of the book."
2,This book is not for men.,"I like to read and I try to catch up on the classics. I purchased this book because I knew it was considered a classic, but I couldn't get into it and put it down before finishing the second chapter. It's not for men."
2,Not what I was expecting,I am a huge fan of the movie with Greer Garson.The book is so disappointing.I was hoping to be captured and sadly was not.
3,typed out dialogues from 6 part BBC series,If you are looking for an unabridged version of the book this is most certainly not it. Looks like someone has typed out the dialogue exchanges from the BBC series and filled in their own interpretation of the feelings at times.
2,"Lovely words, awful characters","This has not survived the test of time. While it's easy to see why this was a popular story from the 19th century up to the 1950s, reading it now is like listening to cat negotiating its way out of a tangled quilt cover, amusing yes, but ultimately awful and frustrating.The motivations of the two central characters are purely woeful. I won't spoil anything but you don't want anyone to get the outcomes that they desire, not the protagonists, not the antagonists, no one.I can't say don't read it as it is so very ingrained in the pop culture of today, however I can say you should read the book trying to identify any part of it that wouldn't be made better by the introduction of zombies."
3,Definitely a peice of work,"Sigh, I almost feel guilty giving pride and prejudice three stars. I find the book to be boring, i've picked it up a few times but it just doesn't resonate with me. Reasons why: I didn't find reading an account peoples personality traits that interesting and the book doesn't really have any exciting pick-me-ups.This book is like taking a nice ride through a scenic country side, without want of a destination."
4,classic,love it or hate it the book is a classic and call me crazy but im a sucker for some Jane Austen.
4,Good humor,Jane creates a colorful cast of characters to people this moral tale of hasty judgement. As always her heroine must suffer mistakes on her part and bear the frailties of others to find happiness.
4,An enchanting romance story,Pride and prejudice is a moving rmance story depicting well the class societ of England and how in the end love prevails over class restraints; pride and individual prejudices. This book causes deep introspection of one's values; beliefs and mores.
4,Brilliant,"This novel grabs you so hard that you just want to know what is going to happen next and why is Darcy and Elizabeth acting this way, what is the deal with all this pride and the prejudice?Even though that their life style in the novel in general does not seem very exciting like our present life style; however I think they were much more sophisticated than we are; they all read, write letters hence mastered the art of writing, and they all can play the piano! nice. in short, the novel is brilliant! that is it!"
4,"History buffs, take note! But, if you're into a ""quick read,"" pass...","This is a wonderful work that definitely is a window into the life of the 18th century. However, the reading of it is bogged down a little because of the speech ( wonderful, but tedious at the same time). Not for immediate gratification people but I will be reading all her works in due time..."
5,One of the very best!,I didn't buy my copy through Amazon because it was an impulse purchase and I am so glad it was. It is unfortuante I waited until my 30s to read it. A true classic I'll never tire of reading again and again!
5,If I were stranded on a desert island...,"If anyone asks me what my favorite book is, hands down it would be Pride and Prejudice. I'm not sure what it is about this book, but I'm hooked. I have read it and reread it countltess times. My small paperback book shows how well it's loved, pages crinkeld, some stained. There's something about opening the book and reading the lines those lines which are so familiar to me that gives me a comforting feeling,. It's the same feeling as coming home after a long time. If I was stranded on a desert island this book is what I'd take with me because it offers a solice like no other. I'd highly reccomend this book to anyone. Getting through it the first time was a bit tough for me, bu t it was worth it."
5,my favorite book of all time,"Jane Austin truly brings out the reality of courting and marraige of nineteenth century England. The language is hard to understand, at first, but you'll learn a lot of new words. I think that this is a classic story, and I recommend it to anyone."
4,Pride and Prejudice,"I have watched the movie many times, so I wanted to see what the book was like. I really enjoyed it. I am glad my Kindle has a dictionary so I could really appreciate the story."
2,Sloppy edition,"Pride and Prejudice deserves a 5 star rating, but this Kindle edition is sloppy, and ""free"" is not an excuse. Those familiar with Jane Austen, and P&P in particular, need only search for ""call her mother a wit"" to see what I mean."
2,pride and prejudice and other books,I buy the books for my wife and she is enjoying them in her retirement along with all the other products we purchased from Amazon
3,Pride & Predjudice,"The book was fantastic. The details that Jane Austen injects in her story tellings paints a vivid picture of the era in which the story in told. The story rates 5 stars, the reason for the 3 stars is as follows:The binding of the book was horrible. In fact sections of the book came out and I had to jostle pages to keep them in order. I've never had that problem w/a book I've ordered from Amazon before."
4,Illustrations light,"The book is a classic and my all time favorite. I read it every year, so I bought it for my Kindle. The Illustrated edition is not worth an extra cost, as they are light and you can't read the type below them on the Kindle."
2,no comment,this book has a good story to it but it has absolutely no WOW in it.. . . . . . . .my friend sugested it but i just couldnt forc emy self to read it. . . . .but the movie is THE BOMB!
2,SO boring!,i honestly dont understand why people love this book so much.. it may have a cute romance and a good plot but Austen took about five times as long to get her point across as she should have. i considered it work to read this book as it was required for school and didn't enjoy more than about 50 pages!
2,I almost lost my Man Card for trying to read this book,"I read the first 100 pages of Pride and Prejudice and then I bailed.I was taking some very heavy damage from several hardened missile silos down below me. I had lost all aileron control and the self-sealing fuel tanks, well, were no longer self-sealing. I had to eject fast or I would auger in from 10,000 feet. I fought my way out of the pilot seat against the compiling G-forces and scrambled with a sob in my throat through the open hatchway.Tumbling in free fall. Feeling of helplessness. Cold air rushing past my ears. I pulled the rip cord and felt the hard snap as my parachute opened and the last I ever saw of Pride and Prejudice was the book dwindling against the bright stars overhead, lost to me forever.I'm telling you I barely made it out of that book alive."
1,why?,why does amazon sell books which classic are and are available everybody in usual libraries or via internet?does amazon have not enough money to sell what is free?
1,BORING,"This is just very boring. Amazon should put more exciting book on the free list, such as, The CHERUB series by Robert Muchamore, Cris Ryan books, and espionge."
1,Me no like,Me no could read that book good. It too slow. Me like better book. Me like Tales from the Crypt. I no think any one should read. I would not read again. If you like torture read book. If you smart spend money on beacon soda
5,"A beautiful, yet sensible love story. A perfect ten.","This is a story of love between a proud man and a prejudiced woman. It's delightful to see how the characters change as the story proceeds. Unlike most other novels that I read , the supporting cast is also elegantly developed, each with a character of it's own. Rich in content while keeping the plot simple."
5,Top of the Tree,There is nothing to be said said about Pride and Prejudice that had not already been said. It truly is one of the best books ever written.
1,Boringgggggg classic,"I may be trying too hard to read a classic book.. I thought P&P would be a good start since they just made another movie on this book.. but I was wrong! the book was boring and plotless. Sure nowaday women are still searching for Mr.Perfect like Lizzy was. But today's women have to deal with much more complicated life problems and worries while searching for the right guy.. The whole book was about drawing room,dinners, and occasional conversations with some ladies urging Lizzy to get married. I better off stick with the modern love stories with real people problems. Glad women have grown so much tougher since the old days."
1,Why do I care?,"This story was written in the early Victorian era, and hence it is quite old. I was pretty much forced to read this book for a summer reading assignment. I found it to be utterly boring. The real question here is why do I really care if the mother has all of her daughters married off to wealthy parnters, or any partner if it must come down to it? Maybe it was a big deal back in the time, but nobody cares nowadays. Maybe it is a 'literary masterpiece', but then why the heck is it so boring? We need to move on from the old 'classics'. They mean nothing to readers (are there many left?) of the modern society."
1,Horrible horrible horrible!,"I hated this book. It was difficult to read, because Austen never seemed to get to the point, and everything seemed to happen so slowly. The characters seemed so pompous, it was ridiculous. I had to read this book for a class, and disliked it so much, i didn't even remember that I had read it (repressing it in my mind). It wasn't until one of my friends who had also been in that class reminded me that we had read it that I even remembered that i HAD read it. Then i remembered why i had forgotten it as much as possible!"
1,what a load of crap...,"this is possibly the boringest classice ever written, which is saying a lot considering the fact they're all quite boring. I mean look at the story, what a bunch of bull! What the hell...omg, Mr.Darcy! *rolls eyes* Could she not have thought of anything more exciting? it's the vainest bunch of crap from and era of crap literature. Go and waste your money on Harry Potter or something."
1,Pride and Prejudice,"I loved the audio book. All movies from this book have omitted the facts of life after the marriage of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. The book does not. By-the-way, what's Mr. Darcey's first name?"
2,complex and wordy,"I picked this book up from my daughter's bookshelf and thought it might be fun to read such a classic. I have to say I am disappointed. About halfway through, I grew so thoroughly bored, I had to put the book down for a few days. It is just a predictable romance novel, nothing especially wonderful or exciting. There is so much conversations and it can get really confusing sometimes."
2,ugh,"i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats, but i just can't get into her writing (i force myself because i feel that i should read the classics, if only to make me a well rounded reader). i found the book slow going and to be quite honest, boring."
4,update,"I previously wrote when I was only Half-way through. I would like to update on what I read since then, now that I have finished the book. It is very well written, with a great plot. Plus, Jane Austen keeps you in suspense, but not TOO much suspense as many books are now. I hightly suggest that you read this book!"
5,Heartwarming,"Pride and Prejudice is a story that graps you by the heart and does not ever let you go. If you have never read this book, YOU MUST!"
5,The Best of All Jane Austen's Completed Novels!,"OK, maybe the title was a little much, but from what i have read...it is. Elizabeth Bennet is a young, satirical, young woman who is prejudiced against Mr. Darcy, a charming yet snobby man. The two argue throughout the entire book but when she realizes her misperception of him, they finally begin to love one another. This is perhaps one of the best parts of the novel, in my opinion.The characters are amazingly sketched out and Mrs. Bennt takes the cake! I had a lot of fun reading her comments as well as the sisters.Even though I am only thirteen, I believe that I fully grasped the novel. The words are a bit confusing, so keep a dictionary on you at all times.Jane Austen is one of my favorites, if not my most favorite, and I want everyone to read at least one of her novels!"
5,Very intelligently written!,"If you enjoy British 19th century literature, you are sure to like this book. I read it for a book group selection, and am so glad I was able to get a copy of it. The dialogue is so wonderfully witty, and full of meanings that are not immediately discernable to American readers that are less familiar with this more formal manner of speaking, as I was. I still enjoyed it, as the story is a romantic comedy that I feel has a little something for anyone that enjoys a good romance. It is definitely more subtle than the kinds of things one reads these days, but that seems to be a good thing. The BBC televised version with Colin Firth is also very good."
5,Beautiful copy of a Wonderful Classic- Very Collectible,"Love the story, and this little book with gold edges is the perfect copy to keep and enjoy again and again. In our disposable society they just don't make books like this one anymore. Great gift for the Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen, lover in your life, or better yet for yourself."
4,"always love reading this, only...","love this classic!!! only, what's with the incomplete names/titles? eg: ----shire ? I've read my grans' copy of this and it did not have those...."
4,Greta read,One of those old classic. One must simply have on ones book case and have read it at least once in there life.
4,Enjoyable read,"Writing styles such as Jane Austin don't usually keep my attention well and, at first, this book was no different. I had to force myself to read the first 6-7 chapters. By a quarter though the book, I found myself enjoying the writing and storyline much more. It was an enjoyable read and I liked the book very much, but I can't say I agree with others who say it's one of the greatest novels ever written. Then again, it's just not my preferred writing style. Also, I got this on my Kindle for free and the formatting was just fine."
5,classic read,great classic and great to have in e-reader form to take with me on trips or anywere i may go by far one of my favorite books
5,Loved this movie !,"I absolutely loved ""Pride and Prejudice"", best purchase I've made yet on Amazon. Keira Knightley is magnificent as well as all of the other actors. I have watched this movie several times and it always brings tears to my eyes."
1,Badly formatted book should not be on Amazon at all!,"Imagine, this was the first download for my new Kindle International edition. Here in Australia we pay $2 more per publication, this triples the price of a $1 book. So what is wrong with this book? Not the content which as we all should know is exquisite. This downloaded book serious sucks because it is badly formatted. Every second line breaks in the middle and paragraphs are separated by 2 lines. This is a classic formatting error. For the technical types, an incorrectly formatted text file was used to create this book. It has embeded returns that just should not be there. An incorrectly formatted book of this nature should not be on the Amazon store at all!"
5,I read it at least once a year...,This book is timeless and never grows old. The wit and humor never ceases to amaze me. I have read it at least 15 times and find something new in it each time. I also recommend the A&E; series on CD. You will love it.Terie Blankenbaker
5,Perfectly Pleased!,"What a pleasure to read! The extra insights are wonderful! The observations are sometimes humorous and add to the text. I only wish there was another book after this one, or two or three. :)"
5,what is this trashy cover?,Obviously Jane Austen was amazing and Pride and Prejudice is incredible. But WHY would they put this cover on it? Why take a classic and make it look trashy? It looks like Lauren Conrad wrote this book... I am disgusted with the publishers.
5,A classic book worth reading.,"It seems almost pointless to write a simple review on this book, but I'm going to anyway. I had to read this for my Women in Literature and Visual Arts class, and it was enjoyable. The characters are well developed, and the plot is simple enough to understand. Overall the book was a bit dry for my personal taste, but it was still good. Jane Austen is a superb author, so it is certainly worth reading."
3,The reader's voice is a bit distracting,"I enjoyed this audiobook overall, but found the reader's voice a bit annoying. I often found it difficult to focus on what it was that she was saying. The other thing that I did not like was how many tracts were on a CD. Each CD is divided into 100 tracks. Great if your listening to it on the CD, but a nightmare if you want to put it on your favorite MP3 player."
4,Classics are mesmerizing,What can I say this classic literature really have me insight to the past and kept my attention piqued. This is definitely a must read !!
4,HUMOROUS AND IRONIC LOVE STORY/SURPRISINGLY MODERN,"Jane Austin wrote a story set in what i originally thought of as a boring period in time. Her story, however, is about five daughters and their love lives. The parents in the story are funny(the father is very sarcastic and the mother is obsessed w/getting her daughters married well off). I was surprised at how easy it was to read and how much it reminded me of modern teenage drama."
5,Ultimate book for a romantic!!,This is definitely a book I would want my daughter to read. I first read it in high school and can not get enough of it. I love the characters and storyline. It is amazing the way she writes. I love watching Elizabeth and wishing she was a 90's woman who could tell Darcy what she really thinks without worrying about the do's and don't's of her time. I live for the ending when Darcy calls her his most dearest Elizabeth. Romantics this is a book for you.
5,A very character oriented novel with supeior descriptions,"P&P is one of my favourite books.The attention given to minor details and the portrayal of both Lizzy and Mr.Darcy is very endearing.I loved the witty remarks and the satire in the descriptions.I think Austen's command of the english language is enviable.Each sentence has it's own significance and there is no line in the book I would have omitted. I particularly liked the scene between Lizzy and Lady Catherine where Lady C demands a promise of her-that of never agreeing to marry Mr.Darcy-every dialogue is so well thought out and even though there is so little of a story to relate,the way the book keeps you rapt with attention is amazing! Whenever I feel lonely or left out this book makes me feel like a part of all its frolicking and ball-dancing.I think that is the power of an author-to be able to make a reader empathise and live thro' the pages. I am still living in the glorious days of Pemberley and Netherfield!"
5,Jane Austen's Suspense,"I have read Pride and Prejudice so many times that by now I should have the book memorized. But, I don't. Instead, I cringe every time Elizabeth Bennet refuses Mr. Darcy's proposal and sit in suspense as I near the part where I think he should propose again. What if this time, they don't meet by chance as they ought? Or what if Mr. Darcy decides not to propose again? What if Elizabeth doesn't realize how wonderful I know he is? Jane Austen is the only author who captures my imagination so vividly every reading; I love her for it."
4,Pride-Prejudice Leather Bound,I was very pleased with the book I received. It was all that was represented and in excellent shape. The delivery was very quick and without problem. This was only my second order on Amazon and was very pleased with all aspects.Signature Classics - Pride and Prejudice (Signature Classics Series)
4,Awesome of course,Never fear this is not a novelization. It's the classic story with a revamped cover. If you are interested in getting the book this is not a bad choice
5,Everyman's Library version is GREAT...,"I loved this book and Jane Austen's style, but this is not a literary review -- this review is on the Everyman's Library Edition.This printing is wonderful and I absolutely love the everyman's library books. If the book wasn't spotless, I would almost think it was an antique edition. The cover is lovely, the binding is solid, the paper is thick and matte, and the font is legible.This book is to be read, loved and proudly shelved for display. Don't waste your money on some tiny, stiff, mass-market paperback.EVERYMAN'S LIBRARY EDITION -- TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,Some annoying issues,"Not bad overall, but missing punctuation and some half sentences serve to pull the reader out of the story. Unfortunate, as this is one story in which the reader hopes to get perfectly lost."
5,Completely Enchanting,"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an account of society in the early nineteenth century. Austen primarily focuses on the ridiculous pressure to marry. She does an exquisite job satirizing or ""poking fun"" at the extreme views of those who lived during that time. She gives the reader a good look at how truly important first impressions are and how love can conquer all. Austen develops her main characters Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, with very conflicting character traits. These conflicting traits allow the build up of tension between these two characters. This gives the novel a pleasant amount of intensity that leads to an ousting ending. Austen sucks you into a thoroughly enchanting world, making the novel impossible to put down. I recommend this novel to those who enjoy intellectual wit and have a soft heart for romance. Pride and Prejudice is a wonderfully endearing novel that is bound to touch women of every age."
3,I was dissapointed that this great work has been abridged.,"When I first found this I thought that it was the soundtrack to the 1996 A&E version of Pride and Prejudice. It is actually the book on CD. This would have been great, except that it is abridged. This book is one of the great classics. I do not think that it is appropriate for someone today to decide what parts of a book written in 1813 are important and what are not. I did not actually keep and listen to this selection. I was not interested in having PART of Jane Austen's great work. Therefore, I suppose that this can not actually be called a review of the CD, only of the case."
1,Pride and Prejudice,"Sirs,I returned this free e-book because, as I passed the pages it would return to the begining of the 2nd. or 3d. chapters that I had already read.I downloaded ""Pride and Prejudice"" in order to re-read it as we read it in High School, but I was exasperated because the pages kept skipping to the past chapters...Sorry about this.... By the way, thank you for the free e-books, anyway....."
3,You get what you pay for,"I'm not reviewing the book here, but the free Kindle version. In short: love the book, hate the formatting.There are many typographical errors from simple typos to random line breaks in the middle of paragraphs, often following a title (Mr./Mrs.). For some reason the book is void of italics and emphasized words are in all caps, which is rather ANNOYING, don't you know? The errors haven't kept me from reading, but they are an irritating distraction.If I knew of the slipshod manner in which this book was transcribed I would have just sprung for the $0.89 version. In fact, I think I will now."
4,Austen,I adore this book. It's a classic for a reason and is worth being read over and over. Look for the subtle humor!
5,Great book,This is a digital version of my favorite book. You can't go wrong with that. It was a great addition to my kindle.
3,Buy if you like Jane Austen,I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. +
3,Would be great if not for typos...,"I love Pride & Prejudice. It's one of my all time favorite books. Therefore, and because it was free, it was the first book I downloaded for my Kindle. I have to say I found some typos in the edition. I'm not sure who's uploading these things but I don't like not being able to trust the content."
4,Great Book,"I was a little disappointed that this issue didn't have any illustrations in it, but the book is wonderful. It is the best love story ever. It truly teaches us that you cannot judge a book by it's cover. A definate must read."
4,Great book for teens +,"I read this book recently as an SSR book for my Honors World Lit class. I'm a sophmore in high school. I found this book very interesting, although it was a bit hard to translate at times. I would recommend the book for any teens who want to read a challenging classic. :)"
5,Wonderful,"Great book, as always. Processing and shipping was lightening fast, thank you! Condition was just as described, price excellent. More orders from me in the future, thank you!"
4,All of J. Austen's books are classics.,"I'm a big fan of classics, and books like Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and Pride and Prejudice, and I've found that I can always look to a Jane Austen book to keep surprising me with her talent and sense of old-fashioned style in writing"
3,"Great book, terrible formatting","This is a great novel. The version published by Public Domain Books (ASIN: B000JMLFLW) as an ebook is a formatting mess, however. Line breaks follow pretty much every occurrence of ""Mr.,"" for example."
5,Jane Austen fan,A true classic. An all-time favorite. I recommend this read to everyone! I love that Amazon offers free Austen e-books.
4,My review on Pride and Prejudice,"Classicly a period piece, thus slower to read due to the verbiage, but, certainly worth the read! I enjoyed her characters and though the places were not as richly described as I would have liked, it was enough. Several new (actually ""olde"") words have been added to my vocabulary!"
2,Pride and prejudice,"Guess I am giving this book an unfair report, as I didn't get to even get it read. So Inshouldnt be a judge for the book."
4,Nice,Some things were harder to understand however I really liked the use of 3 different possible loves and how they played out. I'm planning on reading it a second time after others have been read
3,"Good book, hard read!","I thought it was a good book, but definitely a hard read. I had to read it for school. And I thought it was a great love surely and I liked how the women rolled were powerful."
4,Classic,"Beautiful, classic story. The descriptive language brings to mind romance, fancy balls and gallantry no longer found in this modern age."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"This book is obviously a classic and easy to read. However, the amount of characters is too much to follow and also the author sometimes doesn't let the reader know when a different character is speaking. Which made it a bit frustrating fir the first couple if chapters. Also, I did not feel attached to the characters. Their emotions were held back through the whole book, so when Darcy and Elizabeth finally get together it is not as exciting and heart wrenching as it should be."
3,okay.,Great read. Enjoyed it very much. Going to read it for a second time. really enjoyed the read. Great story and book.
3,Pride and Prejudice,"i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats, but i just can't get into her writing (i force myself because i feel that i should read the classics, if only to make me a well rounded reader). i found the book slow going and to be quite honest, boring."
2,Over-rated Classic Romance,"I wanted so badly to love one the classic romances of all time, but couldn't. I found the story incredibly dated. I was able to get past the archaic use of vocabulary, but not the lack of plot. Most of this lengthy novel is about idle English gentry socializing at each others homes. I had nearly decided to give up on finishing the book, when it picked up a little in the final third. I read the free Kindle edition. While the formatting is not as good as with paid editions, it is perfectly adequate. I can't see any reason to get one of the paid versions, unless you are an Austen fan who wants the collected works organized with an active T.O.C."
3,Classic,This book is a classic and a must read for everyone. Its a perfect book for students in school to read. I love the love/hate relationship between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth.
3,"A story of adventure, poetry, and Love, REAL LIFE SUCKS","I couldn't let my piont of view opinionate this classic story, as I only saw the theater production. But as a body of the human race I'll say this, fall in love with it, become obsessed with it, just don't believe it. We would all wish to be the Elizabeth, but her character had no realism to one of us the real characters of this world.And so dream for your Darcy, Hope for your marrage but never contemplate life to be a script, you only get one rehersal in this life time."
3,Mr. Darcy,"I decided to purchase this book after I watch the movie, to be honest, the movie is somewhat more entertaining than reading the book, the landscape is best describe in the movie. I need an extra effort to read every line in the book, word by word. Maybe my perception would be different if I read the book first, then see the movie."
3,The book that taught thousands of young men to hate reading,"This was a required book in high school English. Thank God for Cliff Notes, because this is the book that taught thousands of young men to hate reading.This summer, I forced my way through the book, because I wanted to understand what was so great about it. I discovered it was GREAT to finish the book. Don't give this book to a kid to encourage reading.This book was clearly written for a different time. Chapter upon chapter of utter tedium conveying precious little to the course of the story. However, in that tedium was character development worthy of study by would be writers. Maybe that's why we were supposed to read it."
3,Not a typical review,"Most of the reviews I read (I had a big project to do)that were negative were from people who said ""Yeah, the book was like, really hard and stuff. And it was long."" I found that these people just didn't understand it. So basically, don't pay attention to these people. :) It took me a while to get through Pride and Prejudice for an AP English project. I agree with other reviewers that it was extremely well written. However, I found the storyline to be rather transparent. It's not a novel to read if you want a deep, insightful book."
1,pride,Purchase is a big word as it was free but after trying to get it in my Kindle with 2 different technicians at Amazon we could never do it. Hopefully will be able to on a 3rd try.
2,"its like this sappy love story, which goes on and on, and on","should have given it only 1 star, but since it is a well liked classic and i'd actually like to save the flames, i'd make it a two. i've read this book 2 times. the 1st time i got to the 40th page, the 2nd time i finished it. i tried to understand, i really did...fine, i didnt. but this story is just so plain un appealing. you spend the whole book hooked on elizabeth bennett and mr darcys' [silly] love affair. it would actually be better if the two fine main characters did not live their lifes in complete fluffness.the love lifes of a group of [silly] and giggling girls and the 'dashing' mr darcy, how much more interesting can it get?"
3,Pride and prejudice,"This a book dealing with the same topic 300 pages long. It's boring and really longwinded, too longwinded in my opinion. Always the same people, the same stories, the same places the whole time. Every page you expect an end but it doesn't end. It just continous with the same things before for another 100 pages. Although you expect an end you aren't really interested in it. When you finishes the book you just have fogotten what you've read at the beginning of the story."
2,A little different view,"The common comment on this book, seems to be people's love for the ... ""love"" story. Mr Darcy, and Elizabeth, how great it is to see them together. Howevor Jane Austin is not a Romantic novelist. Her intent was to criticize her generation. She was in a way, poking fun at people's prejudice. This book is actual considered an ""ironic comedy."" The comedy I can not see, but the irony is definately blinding. The part of this book that bothers me, is not so much within the book itself, but the point of the book. If someone was truly in hatred of their society, noticing the flaws relentlessly, why spend 62 chapters of their life, writing about it? I personally felt that this book, could be summed up in less than four pages, with the same amount of content being delivered, the same lessons being learned."
2,Worthless read,"Such a book with themes such as reputation and class horribly expressed. The main conflict was worthless to begin with. Perhaps its just my tastes, seeing that every other reviewer gave this book 5 stars, I might as well, for the book's sake, give this book 2 stars.One word for you: Redundant!"
3,Meh,"Honestly, I found this book pretty boring. The premise of the novel is a big ""so what"". I really am not sure why this is such a classic and by people swoon over Jane Austen."
5,Very entertaining. It shows how high society behaved.,"I had a lot of fun reading Pride and Prejudice. That is the kind of novel made mostly for intertainment, but it certainly inform us about how people behaved in the old times and what were life perspectives for a girl. Jane Austin was also a master in capturing and describing peoples mind."
1,Book Cover,"I am not satisfied with the book`s cover image. I would have greatly prefered to have the movie image as a cover, since I greatly appreciated the movie, and since we are in the 21 century, were we do not have this kind of image. I would have bought the book if the movie image was featured on it."
1,"Overwritten, dry, dull, and cliched","From Becoming Jane to The Jane Austen Book Club, Me and Mr. Darcy toConfessions of a Jane Austen Addict, 2007 was the year of Jane-mania, sucking out whatever satirical bite Austen might have carried two centuries ago and replacing it with syrupy tote bags and cloying t-shirts that allow a girl to declare herself, ""An Elizabeth in a Darcy-less World"" or (more chillingly) ""Property of Mr. Darcy."" In all the fervor, the only things overlooked were that Austen's prose is overwritten and dry, her plots torturously dull, and her characters one-dimensional clichés."
4,Fast shipping,This was a Christmas present for my Mom. She likes it but says that it is easy to put down. it came in great shape and the shipping was very fast.
4,Pride and Predjudice,"Great classic, couldn't put it down. I liked being able to read it on my kindle. Finding some of the old classics sometimes can be difficult. I like the fact that I can find these through amazon."
5,awesome,"Absolutely amazing! Probably my favorite book ever, and that's a lot coming from an English major. Most would agree it's Austen's best work."
5,A Classic,"Remembered reading this in high school and not fully understanding a lot of the complex issues raised in this book. It's nice to have another read at an older age to appreciate the author's words, and have a better understanding of what makes this such a classic book."
5,Satsified and Happy,"I've read this book a million times. That is, I've read the library's book as well as an old 80's edition that had pages ripped out and taped back together. I ordered this copy as a special gift to me to celebrate my favorite author. This edition is beautiful and well worth the buy. While being a new edition, it has the feel of an older one."
2,P&P = Painful for non-romance lovers,"Wow is this book boring. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was PAINFUL to read.PAINFUL!!!!!The book is filled with rich people being super proper. Oh my goodness it was bad.Although a little more than halfway through the book, I did start to enjoy it. Mainly because they stopped being so stuffy and started being a little more real.There were a bunch of funny, underhanded proper comments, similar to something like ""Why, doesn't she look pretty today?"" but really meaning that she's super ugly and happens to have made herself look good for this moment.The overall story line: Daughters find people to become their husbands.Done.I just couldn't handle it.But it's a classic and I already know some of you are going to agree with me while others are like shouting at the screen in frustration at my review.So tell me your thoughts on Pride and Prejudice!Thanks for reading,Rebecca @ Love at First Book"
3,A classic every one should read,Even though there were more than a few times I had to look up some word that I didn't know. I found this book to be very good
5,Far better than expected.,I was familiar with the BBC TV series which was beautifully produced. i read the book to see how it compared and it was excellent as the characters were exactly as expected. The authors use of english is very enjoyable and more accessible than I thought it would be. Best bit of 200 year old chicklit you can read.
5,Pride and Prejudice,Always a great read. Characters are so endearing but also real in their good points and flaws. Just great writing as a whole like always with Austen.
5,So... I want to be Elizabeth,"The reason I liked this book so much was the main character, Elizabeth Bennet. Her honesty and spunk are a wonderful combination. In a time where frankness was discouraged, hers grew. I also admire how she matures through the course of the novel. Her 'pride and prejudice' are put in their proper place. Her and her father also contribute much humor to the story. Their sarcastic wit made me laugh. Generally, I enjoyed Austen's sense of humor: there were many funny moments. I also found the story's end heartwarming... perhaps I am just a sap, but you should read it and find out!!! I think this would be one of my favorite books so far; I definately want to read more Jane Austen in the coming months!!"
4,A Classic,"Pride and Prejudice was the book that introduced me to Jane Austen. I find the love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth simply irresistible. Will they get together? That kept me in agony. I have to admit that it was hard to follow at times, but it still kept me in suspense. It is so obvious that today's female (and some male) writers emulate Austen's writing, writing touching romantic comedies. This is definitely one of the books that I'm proud to keep on my bookshelf."
4,An amazing classic,"The beautiful language in this novel made it an instant favorite for me. The witty back and forth dialogues and characters created an amazinig atmosphere of intelligent and quirky people. Though the book does not give the reader an idea of what was happening historically at that time, that is part of what makes it a timeless classic. One gets a very good idea of what it was like to live in that time, but without the history it makes it open to all audiences. Pride and Prejudice is an amazing novel that does not disgrace the reputation of classic literature, but gives it a boost up."
4,Good Book,"This was a good book. I loved the movie and liked the book more because I got to know more about the story throuogh the book. The only problem that I had was the style of the writing. It was a little hard to read and understand, but they did have a glossery in the back of the book that told you what everything ment that you don't understand."
5,Well worth it...,"This is a must read. All the senior English classes at my high school watched the BBC movie. Everybody loved the movie. Even the boys. Everybody I know has either read the book since (or read it again in some circumstances) or has plans to read it as soon as they get a chance. The characters are perfect as well as all the description. The entire book is, in a word, perfect. Read It. Watch the movie. Fall in love with Jane Austen (like I have). I am now in the processing of reading all of Austen's novels."
1,Fit for a coffee table,"This book would be perfect for a coffee table. No one would ever with to talk about it. When I read it in high school I thought it to be the most boring book I ever read. I didn't care about all the people trying to be married, etc. I just found this book to be an upper class soap opera. Anyone who likes upper class, sappy, drawn out scenes of lovers trying to get each others attention can read this book and be enthralled. For the rest of us, I would recommend you read a modern romance novel. ALL modern romance novels would be better than this, even if written by William Shatner."
1,I like reading very much,"And I was very disappointed with 'Pride and Prejudice', which I read by choice. It did not offer anything I would expect from a good book: surprise, pleasure (intellectual as well as emotional), humor (the character of Mr. Bennet being an exception), new ideas or meaningful information. After finishing the book I ran to a bookstore and traded it for a second-hand copy of 'A House for Mr. Biswas'. Maybe this time..."
1,ZERO STARS: I HATE JANE AUSTEN,"I HATED THIS BOOK. I READ IT IN HIGH SCHOOL, ABOUT 9 YEARS AGO AND I STILL REMEMBER HOW MUCH I HATE THE PUFFY PATHETIC NARRATIVE OF WHINY WOMEN IN WANT OF HUSBANDS. It is with deep anguish that I note that there are books on how to teach this book in classes, thereby continuing the legacy of pain to innocent students of this day and age."
3,Check it off the list,"Must admit that I only read it so that I can say that it is done. I found this a bit slow. All character development and gossip and very little action. Some people love it, just not me. Side note: I read it using the kindle app on my iPad and didn't have any of the problems mentioned with font size and spacing that some others mentioned."
2,Able to read - but many misspelled words,"Large print is great. But the book was not edited well for spelling errors. Examples: Sophas(sofas), chuse(choose), teaze(tease), shew(show), croud(crowd), staid(stayed), shewing(showing), any thing(anything), any body(anybody), every thing(everything), uncontrouled(uncontrolled). These errors occured over and over again. It was pretty annoying."
3,Too feminist?,"I was surprised to read that a previous reviewer expected to find P&P ""too boring and feminist"". I wish it was either more boring or more feminist. It was so witty and well-written that I couldn't put it down. But I felt uncomfortable with the underlying assumption that a woman's ultimate fulfillment is to marry a rich and gorgeous man. Of course it has very strong female characters, and was a very progressive novel for its time. The fact that it is still so popular makes me wonder how far we have come. I preferred Eliot's Middlemarch - a similar type of novel with a more balanced view of female ambition, morality and emotion."
2,Vastly overrated novel.,"I totally agree with the reader from NY who didn't like the novel(maybe it's something in the NY water). I didn't find any of the characters particularly interesting or the writing style very engaging; in fact, this was one of the few books I had to force myself to finish. All the characters were very pretentious, only caring about how you looked and what family you belonged to. After I finished this book I read JANE EYRE, fearing that I would have the same negative experience. But I cannot say enough about how great a novel Jane Eyre is, and I would recommend anyone thinking of reading P&P to pick up Jane Eyre instead."
5,DONT PAY FOR OTHER ONES; THIS ONE IS FREE,I had to get this e-book to read for an academic compisition test. Convinient because it was free. Plus a good read.
5,Wow,I loved the book so much. It is such an easier read than I thought it to be. I was greatly entertained.
4,Pride and Prejudice,"This book is a classic, and it is not by accident. Austen's way of writing is fine and poetic, and each characters are very realistic. The famous love story has a precious lesson behind it, and it makes you reflect about yourself and your relations with others."
5,Unique!,Jane Austen makes a great chronicle of life. The way country people behaved and their thoughts. Just a wonderful and timeless book.
2,"""Classic"" should be redefined as ""Boring""","Honestly folks, did you really enjoy reading this book? After paragraph after paragraph of needless description and rhetoric, one must scrounge up what's left inside their brain after it being destroyed by Jane Austen's pointless circumlocution to dig up what was actually said in modern English. However, I can see how older adults might enjoy this. If you're under 21, or like to have fun with the books you read, stay away...stay away"
4,Couldn't put it down.,"I ordered this novel because as a senior this year in AP english we are required to read it. I always like to get a head start. First of all, I was very pleased with how fast I recieved the novel (Even under standard shipping). It was delivered earlier than I expected. Then once I started reading it I realized it was full of humor and I was eager to read the next chapter just to see how the plot would unfold. I would recomend this book and amazon.com to all readers who are looking for a no hassle way to keep up with your reading."
2,Overrated - plain and simple.,"""Pride and Prejudice"" is full of fluff and is nothing more than an old-fashioned soap opera. I found the characters very one dimensional, and could not develop an opinion about them. I felt Austen shoved the opinion at us, instead of forming our own. The way she presented the matters of pride and prejudice was very trivial and predictable. It is certainly not worth its hype. I do not recommend."
1,Very disappointed in the recording,"I purchased this recording (read by Lindsay Duncan) through the iTunes store (something I will not be doing again), on the understanding that it was an unabridged recording. This is one of my favorite books, and I know it well enough to realize when sentences are being left out, which happened in several places (I did double-check with my print edition). At least one of the omitted sentences was important for understanding the characters.The other quibble I have is that the recording I purchased consisted of two SIX HOUR tracks. Heaven help you if you lose your place while using an mp3 player.I cannot dis-recommend this recording enough."
2,"Lacks depth, too predictable","Vapid and pompous! Despite the clever rhetoric, the plot and characters are simply too shallow, predictable and archetypical. Yes, this novel is a classic, and an original of the romance genre, but that doesn't make up for the fact that it, in fact, is romance genre: WAY to simplistic.Couldn't stand the book, not when I read it at 20 and not when I gave it another chance at 49. Disappointing because I loved the movie ""Sense and Sensibility"" (with Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), so I thought I would like the author.And yes, I do love Dickens. Despite her myriad adoring fans, in my opinion, Jane Austen's writing lacks depth and cannot truly be compared to Dickens."
5,Comment on Pride & Prejudice,"Amazon -- was it your reviewers who, in your Synopsis section, wrote that Elizabeth, the protagonist in P&P, ""vows that she and her sisters will marry well and targets the elusive Mr. Darcy for herself..."" ? That synopsis is completely inaccurate and a distortion of what this great and witty novel is all about. Please try again."
5,"A Beautiful Story, Beautifully Written","I have wanted to read this book for years, like many people, I've watched the A&E; movie, and have always been in love with Miss Bennett and Mr Darcy's story. I was held back so long from reading it because I was afraid (or perhaps more convinced than afraid) that because of how long ago this book was written, the language would be so difficult to read and comprehend, that I would find little pleasure in reading it. However, I was very mistaken! I was pleasantly surprised as I began to read this book at how smooth is reads while still retaining the magical way of conversation of that period. I loved it! I recommend anyone who has the same reservations as I had about reading Pride & Prejudice to not worry, it reads beautifully!After reading the book, I can really appreciate how true to character and events the A&E; movie kept, but no movie could ever compare! I'm impatient to read more Jane Austen novels, and only wish that I had done so sooner!"
3,Pride and Prejudice,"A classic, this book is a great pleasure to myself and I would recommend it to anyone fond of literature and able to understand higher level reading. Besides, who doesn't love the classics?"
1,Clearly abridged Kindle Edition,"I was very very disappointed when I downloaded this book for my Kindle. According to Amazon customer service, there is no way to tell if any of the free Kindle editions of books are abridged before you download them. In this case, the book is clearly abridged, and it is a very poorly done abridgment. Hopefully, the paid versions of this book for Kindle are not abridged."
5,must read,There is only one thing that I think really says it all.... You can't go wrong with Jane Austin. :
4,Pride and Prejudice,"I found P and P to be extremely slow at first, but became excellent from the middle to the end."
5,Great Classic,"Great story for anyone who has had to deal with the convoluted workings of a family. Meeting new people, making friends, or falling in love is never easy and it's made even more difficult by the human failing of not being able to be open and honest with others from the beginning of the new relationships. This book is more than a window to the past, it is a relevant look at how many relationships florish or fail in our own times."
5,Pride And Prejudice Dover Hardcover Edition,"There are literally thousands of review of Austen's seminal classic Pride And Prejudice out there already. This is a review of the Dover facsimile edition based on the 1894 copy.From the beautiful Hugh Thomson illustrations, to the embossed floral end pages, this edition is top notch. The cover is red cloth with gold foil lettering and peacock on the spine.The first page showing the opening line with huge flowing peacock is a work of art unto itselfIf you are a fan of Pride and Prejudice and long for a well made, permanent hard cover edition of the book, this is the edition for you!"
4,(dare I say it?) a literate Harlequin romance,"Anyone who has ever abandoned a first impression of another for quite an opposite assessment of the person... or had a disingenuous ""friend""... or been mortified by a parent's behavior in front of someone whose opinion mattered... or had a wanton and unrepentant sibling... or been able to lay bear to an object of affection the true meaning of all of the crossed signals and misunderstandings that occurred up until that point... To any such persons (and several more), Austen's novel, though nearly two hundred years old, will surely ring true. As in most any romantic comedy, there is not much question of the couple(s!) getting together in the end, but it's the getting there--and, of course, the revelation of it all in the end--that is the fun."
5,Greatest Romance Ever!,Before I read this book I saw the 2005 film starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. I loved the movie and I was inspired instantly to read Jane Austen's classic novel. Despite the fact that I had already seen the movie and knew the general progression of events I was still captivated by the novel. Jane Austen writes with an incredible literary style that is lacking in the works of most contemporary authors. She has an eloquence of words that is complex and yet far easier to read than most people seem to think. Though I am usually not a fan of novels that are based in reality without any hint of the supernatural I was enthralled by Austen's timeless love story which will leave every female reader pining for the dark and brooding Mr. Darcy.
4,Pride and Prejudice Review,"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a classic of English literature for good reason. The characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are quite well drawn. One of the best aspects of the novel is the vantage point from which it is written.The reader learns everything through Elizabeth Bennet's point of view and sees the world through her prejudices. The point of view broadens as Elizabeth develops as a character and loses her prejudices, particularly against Mr. Darcy.Pride and Prejudice continues to be extremely popular and inspires many spin-offs including Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Its influence on English literature and its continued appearance in popular culture alone make it worth reading.Trev @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com"
4,Great book,"This is a really good story, it has been revised, so I was a little disappointed by that. I've been wanting an unabridged text, but this is still really good. A fun read."
5,I'm so glad that I was forced to read this for school...,"Pride and Prejudice is an amazing, amazing critique and representation of nineteenth century society. All I have to say is wow. This edition, however, is very small print, and definitely not easy on the eye. I am reviewing this one because it was the version that recieved from school. It is so enticing, once i reached about halfway through the book, I couldn't put it down at all. I was delighted with the complexity of the characters and the way in which Jane Austen opens up the thought process of the main character, Elizabeth. This is one of the few classics that deserves the word ""classic"" to be applied to it. Pride and Prejudice is a must read for anyone, but requires a substantial amount of thought and maturity. I loved it."
5,Fantastic work,"I had expected this book to be so dry and boringly romantic that I almost loathed the idea of starting it. Once I got into it, however, I had to admit that not only was this book really well written, but it was far more captivating than I ever imagined it would be. The book is true to its title, using the plot of Elizabeth and her sisters and family to illustrate thoroughly the concepts of pride and prejudice as they related to 19th century England society. This book and its sister novel, ""Sense and Sensibility"" are both not only better written than most contemporary novels, but also share appropriately the attributes of being timeless novels. Though much lighter in spirit than many other ""timeless"" works of that and other early eras, particularly Joyce or Wilde, the novels nonetheless convey well an important intellectual body of work and culture."
5,I don't normally give 5 stars,"But for this book I have to. I first picked up Austen's P&P when I was in middle school and it failed the 3 chapter test. (You know the test: if you aren't interested in the book by chapter 3 put it down.) I picked it up again a few years later and simply fell in love with the wonderful story.Austen may have written the book over a century ago but the themes that play out within its pages are universal today. Pride, wealth, and station in life are still as important today as they were when Mrs. Bennet was hoping to find husbands for her daughters. In P&P Austen writes about falling in love, how we view it, and how we don't always understand it. Is mutual regard enough for a lasting marriage? What about passion? And does passion or regard equate to love? I reread this book every time I need a reminder that love isn't always fanfares and fireworks."
5,Elizabeth is my heroine,"I love this book. I can't believe I had never read it -- I'm 30 years old and don't remember ever reading any Jane Austen, but this is only the beginning for me!"
3,Well written,"I must admit that this is a very well written book: the situations, the characters, the idea. I must also admit, though, that for that very fact, I didn't enjoy the book. The book was a comedy of manners on society and people. Most of the people were irritating, and I couldn't get into it. This is not to say that there is a flaw in Austen's writing. She is a most excellent authoress. I was so annoyed by the well-written characters that I couldn't enjoy them."
3,P & P,I am not much for writing reviews let alone writing more then a few words and don't like it when forced to so It's okay. Maybe it is the cover.
3,Pride and Prejudice,Haven't read it all so I can't really say if I like it or love it. Maybe when I get a chance to read more of it I'll know how I like it.
5,Mr Darcy Nuff said,One of the best romances in the world of literature. Every woman wants a Mr Darcy although in the BBC adaptation I actually preferred Bingley ;)
5,Classic love tale,Great timeless romance! Looking forward to reading another Jane Austen book. I anticipated a happy ending and she delivered. Thanks
2,BedBook,"The ""BedBook"" format is so unusual, it should be made more clear to purchasers....I wouldn't have been interested if I had known this."
3,The ABRIDGED Version,"I couldn't find anywhere whether or not this was an abridged or unabridged version. I found out when the book on CD got here that it's abridged...not what I wanted at all. Although it lasted a car ride back home from school, I would prefer to listen to the whole book, not a synopsis."
3,"Great story, poor editing.","I give this an average rating for the poor editing. The font was fine, but there were so many typos. That said, it was the first Kindle book I ordered because this is my favorite book of all time. I love the book so much, I kept reading through the typos and that's not easy for me. It was free, however. I guess you get what you pay for, right?"
1,NOT a good version for Kindle,"Note to all Kindle users - there are some books that are meant to be read on the Kindle and some that must have just been scanned into the computer. This version is in the latter group. It's AWFUL. Sometimes you only get half a screen, other times the text is different sizes. It has no table of contents for navigation. I love the book, I hate the version."
2,"Excellent book, Kindle version poor","It goes without saying Pride and Prejudice is a classic of all time. My concern here and the reason for the low rating is the poor quality of this Kindle version. There are typos and in several places in the text very, very simple errors are made: in a few places, the same word repeats itself along the lines of ""the the chair,"" a couple malapropisms I am positive were not in the original text, and other typesetter's error that, if this Kindle edition had been subject to even a cursory review by a proofreader, would have been caught. I too would like to mention the FACT that emphasized WORDS are all CAPITALIZED in this version as AMAZINGLY annoying. I have never seen an actual book loaded with so many simple errors as this ebook is."
3,Not as good as H.G. Wells,"The Coming Race is a fine sci-fi novel, of the 1800's variety. For the most part it is quite enjoyable, and Bulwer-Lytton's vision of the Vrilya is quite comprehensive. Still, though, overall the book felt a little too short, and a little too amateurish, when compared against H.G. Wells, or more modernish sci-fi authors. Still, a recommended read by all means!Regarding the Broadview Press edition, I always get one of these books if I'm reading classic fiction because I love all the extras they have, like essays or other short related stories by the same author or script and newspaper excerpts, however I was sorely disappointed to find none of the above in this book, beyond an introduction that didn't tell me much that Wikipedia hadn't already."
3,Great story but an old school writing style.,"Loved the story, but even for a fast reader, I got bogged down part way through and never got back to it."
1,Waste of Time,"This book perhaps was inspired by Lytton's séances with Daniel Dunglas Home. A character Zee is mentioned. ""Z"" was reportedly a spirit who influenced Lytton to write Zanoni. It is a very short book. It took me about an hour to read. I can see how it might have been interesting 140 years ago, but I think it can only be recommended to hardcore fans of early fantasy/science fiction. Lytton has a sprawling style of writing with paragraphs that sometimes drag on for a whole page. The one thing that I found slightly interesting was that with the concept of the ""vril bath"" he appeared to anticipate Wilhelm Reich's orgone box."
2,Vrillified,"This is a dreadful novel, whose only claim to fame is that it inspired a large bunch of nutters to create the Second World War. It's content though entirely fictional prompted the creation of the Theosiphists, the Vril Society, the Thule Society and ultimately formed the philosophy of the NAZI Party. As entertainmant, its a total loss,a poor version of A Journey To the Center of the Earth. Even Tarzan at tne Earth's Core is a more enjoyable read."
2,Boring,"I bought this book hoping it would explain the inspiration for the Vril Society. Why would anyone be moved by this book to form a society following the idea of Vril?? Not only is it boring, but it is written like a children's book. Everything is explained like this...the grass was green and everywhere there was light...blah blah.... horrible imagery! I'm being biased only b/c I've read so many things about how the Vril Society influenced Nazism...and now I can't imagine why. This book sucks."
2,complete waste of time and money,"After visiting this man's house I wanted to know more about him. I obsessed about buying this book, and after several fruitless recon e-mails to vendors and the National Trust, I bought the book. WASTE OF MONEY. It is an edited version of CPW's original papers. Without serious psychological interpretation it doesn't illuminate his life at all. It's not even tactilely satisfying. The book is a flimsy small paperback."
3,"Dolphin, Shark, Turtle and Penguin to Paint",The figures are of good size and well detailed. Wish the paint was a bit more plentiful as it took too coats to cover the white plastic with some colors. The little brushes that came with the set are worthless. My Grandson loves dolphins so he was thrilled. And had a blast painting these.
5,This product can definitely be wrapped up with ...,"This product can definitely be wrapped up with one word -- WOW!! I thought it would be like most other shower gels: all hype and no lather. But this one really surprised me. I really didn't want to get out of the shower. It left me clean, invigorated, and energetic. It has LOTS of lather and rinses completely. Very fresh and clean scent that lasted most of the day. I highly recommend Neutrogena, and this product is no exception. Always meeting or surpassing my expectations and living up to the standards of their name. Buy it!"
4,I really enjoyed trying the Neutrogena Awakening Shower ...,"I really enjoyed trying the Neutrogena Awakening Shower and Bath Gel. The gel works great in the shower, and it's easy to dispense and not get out too much product. I really liked it. My skin was very smooth and easy to moisturize following my shower. The fragrance is citrus -- but not too overpowering or long lasting, if that's not your thing!"
4,Final Cut Pro 2 for Macintosh,Final Cut to is a easy to use and powerful video editting program. This book is not as extensive as the program's manual but it also isn't an overwhelming encyclopedia. Easy read and very useful!
1,did not purchase this product,There is some mistake. I never purchased this book. Please review your files. Please give me feedback. This concerns me greatly.
1,Use the manual!,"So tell me why I want this over the manual? The manual is EXACTLY the same style but more complete. All I can see is a book that I paid money for when I have a manual that gives me exactly what I want.I got FCP2 as a present being I'd always talk about editing my DV footage so thought I'll get round to using it by buying a book, thinking it'd be better than the manual. The manual is great and easy to read. This book is just easy to read! It's like a selection of pages from the manual. If you want a summary of the manual buy this book. I've returned it."
4,search finished product,I was looking for this kind of ring all this passed summer. The product itself fits perfect and looks great with my other rings. I do with it was less chinese dragon like and it rapped around my finger but it is still cool.
2,CLOUDS WATER,"This ammonia remover was useless, I didn't see any changes plus it made my water cloudy. I prefer the activated carbon over this."
2,Warm?,"I've used similar products... with a girlfriend or solo.. and they truly had ""warming"" effects. This didn't at all, and the formula they use doesn't seem to affect gliding or reduce friction all that much. Try something else."
5,A great team,"What makes this CD amazing is the combination of Khalife's haunting vocals and mesmerizing instrumentals with really stirring lyrics from poet Mahmud Darwish. No where in the write-up does it seem to mention Darwish, but the lyrics from at least three of the songs are based on his renowned poetry."
5,Haunting and beautiful,"This is sad but beautiful music, and I'll enjoy listening to it many more times. (I bought the 1999 version; I am also interested in hearing the one from 1983 after reading Lunar07 and others' comments that this release is a rearrangement of the original. It IS confusing that Amazon mixes the reviews for these two items.)I was really pleased to see that the insert came with the lyrics in English, French and Arabic. One of the many reasons I enjoy getting CD's instead of just downloading the music digitally."
3,"Helpful, but too general","This is a great book. It helps by teaching you the basics. However, the book is too general and confusing. Most of the people in my class agree, it does not give us a definate answer to anything."
2,Turbo Scratcher Replacement Pads,My cats have been using the Turbo Scratcher for years. The pads used to be high quality and very durable. Unfortunately the pads are now very poor quality and fall apart within a matter of a couple of weeks. The entire middle section of the pad is easily pulled out when the cat is using it and the entire pad totally unravels.With the cost of replacing the pads that fall apart so quickly and easily the turbo scratcher is not the most efficient scratcher option...it can get pretty expensive over time.
5,great toy,"my cat loves to scratch this and I usually put in some cat nip to encourage him, saves wear and tear on carpet and furniture"
3,it's ok -,My cat played with the ball but did not really set her feet on the scratcher to scratch despite putting lots of dried catnip --- I bought more catnip and put it on the scratcher --- did not work --- she had a good time playing chasing the ball and we had fun watching her --- but I want her to scratch the scratcher
5,great price,"as a prime member, this is a great value compared to the usual discount super stores and it saves me so much time. No more searching for parking and waiting in long lines for checkout."
3,Glad to finally find them - but not as good as original.,"I was glad to finally find the refills for my cats' favorite scratching pad since they tore up the first one. I ended up ordering four of these packs and started using them, but the texture is slightly different on the cardboard from the original one and my cats don't like this one quite as much. They also start ripping the center of the circle out and if I don't repair it right away, the entire pad is unraveled and all over my home when I come home from work!All in all it's still a good pad - still a favorite of the cats and it holds up once I glue the spiral together again. I may have just gotten a bad batch, but I'd try again in the future."
2,Kind of tricks you...,"So, it says that it comes in a pack of two, but mine only came with one. The product itself is really great (very sturdy and my cat loves it!). So, if you're thinking you'll get two, you probably won't."
2,Picture Misleading,"The picture shown is in correct. Two pads are supplied, however, they are only 1"" thick. The picture shows two pads that are twice as thick. It appears that the picture was taken of four pads. I will not order again from this supplier."
3,not as good as the original,"I was extremely happy with the original toy and its cardboard scratching circle. But I was not happy with the two replacement scratching circles. They are impossible to insert without losing the outer band and they unravel as you work with them, and they therefore are not going to last as long as the original. But my cat loves it, so in the end that is all that matters."
3,Even with catnip my cats just sit on them,"My cats are really dumb and think the Turbo Scrather is a cat bed. I've had cats forever and the two I have now are by far the dumbest ever.Give that this is basically a piece of cardboard, the price is really expensive. Think about it: Over seven dollars for two pieces. That's ridiculously expensive. I throw out more cardboard that that every week.I did put some catnip in and my cats can smell it but I don't know why they don't scrath it. At least they don't think it's a litter pan...This thing slides around on smooth surfaces like tile or wood. It works better on carpet. Some rubber feet would have been nice."
5,These are great!!,My cats have had a Turbo Scratcher for years now and these inserts are great for cats who love to claw. They're easy to change out and last a long time. Would highly recommend.
5,My kitty loves her turbo scratcher,"My kitty scratches on her turbo scratcher every day, but the pads last a long time. I've very satisfied with them."
5,cat scratcher pads,These cardboard cat scratcher pads are really good for my indoor cats. They both enjoy them first thing in the morning and as needed during the day. I like the price and availability (ordering through amazon).
5,Perfect,Fit perfectly in my Turbo Scratcher cat toy. Arrived on time and in new condition. My cat is very happy to have her scratcher toy back. Don't forget to add cat nip! They love it.
3,Incomplete,"The original Pad that came with the Turbo Scratcher was loaded with catnip which attracted the cats and made the whole purchase worthwhile. It is a great cat toy. BUT, Upon purchasing the replacement pads here, there was no packets of catnip for enticement as the product stated there would be. Now it is of limited use until I can purchase catnip on my own."
3,Disappointed,"I was so happy to find a new source for the replacement scratchers but I am disappointed in the quality of the product. There is so little glue holding the cardboard together, my cat tore apart the first one within the first few days. I was prepared to rewind and reglue it each time he pulled it apart. It's time to get the glue bottle out again before he unravels it all over the floor, again."
2,product great - Amazon price to high,Really surprised at the too high price for these at Amazon - should be about half this price. Shop around and you can get them cheaper.And I am a daily & long-term Amazon shopper...
5,Item was great.,The item was great. It was new in package. It came promptly and was packed well. Thank for very much.
4,Good product,"We own and operate a cat rescue. While these scratchers are great, made in the USA and quite affordable, we really could use scratchers that are a bit more durable for the many cats that use them here. I'll keep ordering them though!"
4,Perfect fit!,These refills fit perfectly in the Turbo Scratcher I purchased last year from Amazon. My cats love them. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they do not come with catnip like most other products like this. Great price from Amazon!
4,cat scratcher replacement pads,"Good product, good price. I only wish that I could get the pads in bulk. I need to stayed stocked!"
5,the cat's meow,the bergan turbo scratcher is great.my cats love it and i love that my furniture is safe.
5,Bergan Trubo Scratcher Replacement Pads,Excellent Quality and they fit our turbo ball toy/scratcher perfectly! We were very pleased with this product!
5,Cats are happy.,We have used these pads for several years and the cats love them and the toy ball that is in the holder. They can get expensive at the pet store so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon at a much lower cost than the store. Same quality just less expensive.
5,"Haven't had to use these yet, but definitely will need them.","We are not through with the original one that came with the scratcher, but almost! Hard to find in stores nearby."
4,cats love it,"These scratching pads wear pretty well. I flip them over when one side is shredded and get more wear out of the second side, although not as much as the first side."
5,"Bergan Turbo Scratcher Replacement Pads, 2 Pack",I have two Bergan StarChaser toys for my cats and they love it so much I bought back-up StarChaser balls and Turbo scratch pads for when they wear out. I would definitaly recommend Bergan StarChaser toys to anyone with a cat.
3,Interesting but not Cochrans's best Recordings!,"Note that most of these recordings are alternate versions; in most cases inferior compared to the more well-known versions.The sound qualtity is uneven and most of the tracks are demos or rehearsals.There are some great instrumentals such as ""Guybo"", ""Meet Mr Tweedy"" ""Song of New Orleans"" (3rd/4th Man Theme) and ""Chicken Shot Blues"""
3,"Superficial, but fun","I enjoyed this book, but it didn't tell me much about myself that I didn't already know - my problem areas are just what I knew they would be, but there were, unfortunately, none of the advertised techniques to ""get happier"" in those sections.My favorite thing about this book was the percentile rankings for the various tests at the end of each section. It's the first self-help book I've seen that allows you to compare yourself to others (not necessarily the healthiest thing to do, but certainly something I want to know). Sometimes, those percentile rankings made me wonder who his test subjects were. I suspect they are all from some reasonably prosperous, almost all-white suburb of a city in the US - culturally, the tests seemed a bit narrow. I am actually shocked at how materialistic most people must be, if the score spreads here are at all accurate.It's a quick read, and might be helpful to a lot of people. Just don't expect any deep revelations from it."
2,Poor quality of download,"This is the quality of the download and it reads ""APIS DORSATA. See6ES. APZARir, OUT. See Out-Apiaries. ARTIFICIAL r ERTILIZATION. After the reader has read the subjects of Dkoxes. Queers, and Ql'eex-kearixg."" Poor quality of the download.....would not recommend anyone download this book. Get a real copy...something you can read."
5,Give Them The Boot!,The Sterilite Large ShowOffs are excellent for storing boots. My husband has commented that these were an easy way to carry his boots when going to our cabin for hunting. I put one boot upside down on the other and they fit securely for traveling. Our son's boots are a bigger size so I can only place one boot and extra hunting socks in each container. Keeps them organized for safe transport and keeps all the muck from being tracked in the house when they return from their hunting trips. I also use the medium Show Off Storage Containers for organizing and storing our shoes. ~ Mrs. B.
4,complete Dichterliebe,It was a wonderful experience to listen to all the 20 songs Schumann originaly composed for his song cycle.
1,too high,after I got done putting this in a frame seen it for about the same price with frame at micheals a craft store .
3,Print is 10 by 14 not 16 by 20 unless you include the boarder,"I like the print and it was well packaged. I was dissapointed that the size of the print was 10 by 14 instead of 16 by 20. This was probably my error for not reading the description carefully but the description said 16x20. The poster was 16 by 20, the print was 10 by 14."
4,Where we are. Where we're heading,"This is a very interesting book that discusses where scientists are, and where they're heading, with unraveling some of the most pressing science questions of the day. It's fun to see how past discovers were made and how those discoveries shaped our understanding of the world."
4,social science travel lit,"Basially, in ""The Ends of the Earth"", Kaplan employs the same finely-honed writing technique that he used to good effect on the topics of Yugoslavia and North America, respectively, in ""Balkan Ghosts"" and ""Empire Wilderness"" -- namely, to combine travel writing with social scientific analysis to craft a perspective on a locale that is both personal and abstract, immediate and general at the same time. This is a wonderful method, which makes his writing much less dry than other ""country studies"", but also leads to Kaplan's fatal flaw of over-exaggeration and over-generalization. His theses on the third world and its future (the basic topic of ""Ends of the Earth"") are ground-breaking, original, and probably a little bit too sensationalistic and over-hyped. Nevertheless, it's eye-opening stuff that takes you way beyond the news headlines and guidebooks."
1,Don't Judge a Book by It's Cover!!!,"While the story itself is amazing and I would highly recommend it, the hard back version that it listed for sale is more than unfortunate!!! It is a homemade hardback! The ""publisher"" has cut the cover off, bound the book and then pasted the cover back on. If you don't like pirated CD's you will not like this hardback version. I recommend buying the paperback; that way you will not only enjoy the amazing story but also the book itself!!"
4,Don't be fooled into thinking this is a simple travel book..,"It seems aparent that many people look at this book thinking it is a travel book for possible vacationers. Obviousely, for any person with common sense, these are not places you would want to visit. Kaplan focus is more on the darker side of humanity, and what brings us to it. As seen with his foreboding telling of things to come in Balkan Ghosts, he has a gift of predicting serious human conflicts on our planet. But not only that, he has the remarkable ability to search for the most minor details to explain why. Most importantly though, Kaplan makes perfectly clear what many refuse to acknowledge...the human population of this planet is rapidly exceeding natural limits, while we fall behind drastically in ways to solve this problem. I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels that the relatively minor problems that we face on a day to day basis will soon be a pleasent memory if we don't wake up and realize what we are really doing."
5,Reality Check for U.S. Readers and Other Westerners,"Robert D. Kaplan investigates places that others fear to look at too closely -- the Third World shantytowns, urban centers, and countrysides where ""borders"" lose meaning and cultural divides reign supreme.Expect your world to get more complicated and full of violent revolution -- not less -- as scarce resources, competing cultures, natural human ambition, religious conflict, and authoritarian governments observing artificial frontiers explode into anarchy, confounding NATO nations andthe media.ENDS OF THE EARTH is a ground-level view of how the other 99% lives. -- Ed Stackler"
2,"A nice read, though a bit too shallow and wandering","Although some parts are of great interest, I was surprised at how much time the writer uses getting a hotel or waiting in customs. I bought the book hoping to get a brief review of some remote corners of the world, and to some extent I did, but too many chapters seemed to be about dirty toilets in Uzbekistan. Some chapters, such as Iran, were very informative though too many others lack focus. Every now and then I buy a book (sight-unseen of course) from amazon.com that I know I would have never bought if I could have leafed through it in a store. This was one."
2,Don't confuse the kids!,"Christmas is sacred to me, and it's something that should be taught to young children in a way that does not confuse fact with fiction. Fantasy stories that are clearly about things unrelated to the actual birth of Christ are fine as long as they are not promoted as truth. The real events surrounding the birth of Jesus should not be told with fantasy of such a degree mixed in. If you want your kids to know the Truth, especially if they are very young, don't read this to them, and make sure they don't really believe in Santa Clause either, 'cause if they do, then when they find out one day that he is not real, they might wonder if Jesus is real or just a fairy tale too."
2,A rare miss for Asprin,"Robert Asprin is a great writer. That being said, I didn't love this book. It just wasn't my cup of tea. While it had good writing, it never spoke to me. Which is odd since most of Asprin's books hit me like a bullet right between the eyes."
3,not as much teaching as I had hoped.,"This CD has a short clip of Callas teaching at the very beginning and then at the end of the CD pretty much giving a generic goodbye to the class. She makes one funny comment in the first track and that's about it. The rest is recordings of her and her students alternating singing a few arias. I did not learn very much or gain a new appreciation for the technique. For a really INCREDIBLE, TRANSFORMING master class recording, get the Daniel Barenboim ""Barenboim on Beethoven"" DVD set. I am not a former student of music, but my husband is and we both enjoyed it on TV so much that we bought it from the PBS website (should've bought it on Amazon, would've been cheaper but oh well) and we still talk about it to other people."
5,This is worth a look.,"After watching this Anima I have to say it's one of the best I've seen in a long time. Not only is it worth a gander I dare say this twice ""...it's one of the best I've seen in a long time."" Get it, watch it, you won't be disappointed.If I were to describe this anima I would say it's kind of like Inuyasha in reverse. You have this all powerful, all knowing, wolf goddess who fallows this young, smart, well mannered business man who seeks his fortune in low risk trading but it seem to take place in the European area (most likely England) during the 14 - 16 hundreds with pretty much no dragon ball esc fighting that Inuyasha seemed to be prone to.So if you watch this hoping for a well animated fight seen; you won't get it. However; if you like a story driven by its players that is seemingly well writhen and beautifully well translated with little to no translation errors but with a Shakespearian feel to it with its mix of tragedy and comedy then this would be the anima for you."
3,"Awesome Anime, Bad DVD",The title really says it all. The show itself is extremely awesome but the DVD is subpar. The fansubs I got while this was being aired are of a much higher video quality and the subtitles look much better. It really saddens and worries me that Funimation felt that this is release quality.I can't really say much about the dub. I switched to it for a few moments and quickly switched back to the Japanese audio. The voices just don't fit the characters in my opinion.
2,"Sacrifing quality for finances, the Funimation way.","Perhaps if Funimation would use three to four discs, instead of sacrificing quality by using only two discs for thirteen episodes, this might be worthwhile. Seriously, do they think people would not notice? Answerman, a reviewer from Anime News Network, agrees with my assessment. He states:""In North America, maybe Funimation will finally get through their concrete skulls that putting seven episodes of anime on one DVD makes it look like decaying raw sewage, and will wake up and delete their squeezeboxes and re-release all the affected series (including Fruits Basket) with no more than five episodes per DVD.""Here is the url, if you are interested:[...]"
5,Awesome,"I have no idea what would make this any different from the prior version, but the cover was so worth it. Haha The quality of the series on the DVD is wonderful also, I have not seen it in such great quality before. I would gladly recommend this product to any other fans of this anime, especially at the great price this was lowered to. :)"
5,Crazy prices!,"I am not talking about the anime, just the set. I Was bidding on this same exact set on eBay and got it brand new for $30. I knew it was valuable and rare, so that's why I bid. The prices people want for it is just crazy. I would've never paid $100+ for two DVDs. I recommend you buy the Blu-ray or newer DVD set, they are just as good, but if you have money and want all the sets like me, then buy it. If you do buy this set, try to look around more. The price is for serious collectors only.. :) - Aleu"
5,Holo,"This a great series for anyone who likes anime. It's an interesting turn away from the usual action or drama and talks about how business was handled in older times. The characters are well executed and have a wide range of moods and actions. You will love Holo for the character she becomes over time. The story moves along a little slowly, however, you will await season 2 with bated breath."
5,Love this booK!,"Hi! Just wanted to let you know that I love my Zarelas cook book! It was a surprise because it is beautiful, has a ton of onformation of the region, AND has awesome pictures. 5 Stars for this book. You wont be dissapointed!"
1,Absolutely Toxic Odor,"I've been sleeping on air mattresses for 15 years due to a bad back. Been buying Intex and Coleman, and each brand generally lasts for 6-9 months, and then a seam fails, and you buy another mattress. I only mention this to offer that I really know what air mattresses should smell like.The one I received today from Amazon is absolutely the most toxic-smelling product I've ever had the misfortune to purchase. It doesn't smell like vinyl or plastic - it smells like some sort of insecticide or industrial chemical to me. The fact that the odor comes off on your hands makes it even worse, as it suggests to me something on the plastic, and not the plastic itself.I will give it one day to air out - but if it smells this bad tomorrow, it is going back to Amazon."
4,Good for it's purpose,"Bought this for traveling, but my son has been testing it for over a week now. Out of the box it has a strong plastic odor that subsides after a day (I'm overly sensitive to smells so this was great). It's held up well for a 150# 5'7"" boy who's not all that careful getting into and out of bed. It needs a shot of air added to it nightly before using again, but not more than a short burst just to tighten it up.Overall, we're happy - it will do well on our trips."
3,2 Minutes with my foot?! My FOOT!,"Perhaps I had a defective bed, but there wasn't a valve on the foot pump. Instead, my hand or foot had to act as the valve inflating the bed. Once I figured that out, it still took about 20 minutes to get the device inflated. I also wasn't able to get the pressure high enough with the foot pump to prevent it from sagging and leaving me with a cold spot close to the ground.If I was aware of how ineffective the foot pump would be I would have just gone with a regular air bed and an air pump."
1,Deflating air matress,"This mattress was great for the first four hours. Then my back would touch the floor and I would be wide awake. Kinda of like a gradual alarm clock, but set about four hours too early. Pay more and get an air mattress that works!"
4,twin bed review,"It seemed to deflate somewhat overnight, but it was very convenient to pump up with the built in pump. Good to have for extra sleep space."
2,Leaks,Didn't last very long and I was actually disapointed. Couldn't find the leak and it kept deflatting. Even tried taping it up and didn't work.
3,Inflation instructions left me confused,"I purchased this to use when my children have extra friends sleep over, or when I put a child on my bedroom floor on a ""doggie bed"" (because I have given their bed to houseguests). The first night I needed it I gave up atempts to inflate it because the instructions did not make sense to me. The next day I googled inflation tips and it worked well. I did not notice any toxic plastic smell the previous reviewers complained about."
3,What you pay for,"You definitely get what you pay for, works fine, just keep re-inflating it before you sleep on it as it does lose air. Manual pump option was nice, but makes it so that it can't pack up as small as the same brand Queen size w/o manual pump option."
2,The built in foot pump sucks!,"I just got this airbed and tried filling it up with the foot pump that is built inside the airbed.The foot pump sucks since it takes forever to inflate so I just grabbed my electric pump and inflated it in a minute.Once it is inflated, there is a large hollow spot right where the foot pump is since it doesn't inflate above the foot pump.If you want a twin airbed, Intex makes the same thing with a battery powered pump for almost the same price when on sale. Sometimes, it is even cheaper than this one was. Plus, having the battery powered pump will allow you to inflate other air products since it has 3 different size valves for it:http://www.amazon.com/Intex-Prestige-Downy-Twin-Airbed/dp/B000HBIL7G/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1328641525&sr;=8-3"
3,Manufacturer's Hype,I don't see how throwing this battery into a landfill is more environmentally friendly than recycling it! (refer to manufacturer's hype).
2,software is useless- book mediocre,"Unless you're a data-entry maven, the software is worse than useless. Why waste hours of time entering the info for your books, when the technology exists to simply enter the ISBN and get all the relevant data? (see www.bookcrossing.com to see how easy this could be)The ""shelf feet"" info was somewhat confusing, suggestions for classifying by genre was vague, and the material could have been presented in a much more logical fashion.Layout of the book also lacks...although non-fiction isn't necessarily as compelling as fiction, this really puts me to sleep.There is some good information in here, but overall it is a dissappointment. I am only hoping that it doesn't take potential librarians and turn them off from the whole idea. This book reads like a marian-the-librarian steriotype. Libraries can be vibrant, alive and FUN. This book is none of the above."
1,there's a better alternative,I spent a fair amount of time looking for something like this last year and couldn't believe there weren't more options. I finally installed Book Collector from a tiny little outfit collectorz.com) and it works fine.But here's something that mystifies me: why doesn't Amazon offer something like this? They could automatically add the information on books you buy from them.
3,I like the way this Neutrogena Rainbath felt ...,"I like the way this Neutrogena Rainbath felt on my skin, but I wasn't very pleased with the scent. I expected it to be more """"citrusy."""" Also, the shape of the bottle makes it difficult to use. It's thinner at the bottom, so it doesn't stand up well in the shower or bathtub. Overall, the product worked well, though, and my skin didn't feel dry after using it."
2,rip off size for money,"This size is so tiny, and for the money noway worth itWHY does Amazon list also this SAME stuff as 32OZ, BUT, oh gee, its not avail, and It has not been for months as I have checked backI used to buy this all the time from Costco but not a member anymore.and you can NOT find the 32oz bottle anywhere. But I know Costco still has this Citrus as I called them the other day"
3,Dubious tracklisting...,"I find it odd that the tracklisting here is *exactly the same* as it is for The World's Greatest Goa Collection. I haven't actually listened to this CD, but I know all the songs, so I can say something about it.The collection is good; Solid Electronics (Astral Projection) is pretty much amazing. A lot of the other songs are good, too.I'm guessing that the only difference between this collection is that the tracks here aren't mixed. If they are, there'd be essentially no difference between this and The World's Greatest... (which is mixed). So, if you like nonstop music, go get that; if you like your songs separate, buy this."
4,Grows into ur cells,"Never judge a book by its cover .. so true. When I bought this CD, I never knew what is in store for my ears and mind. Tracks like Kashmir, Subconsciousness, Nanosphere Courier, Assimilation are some of the hot ones. takes u to a level that ur mind is not ready for & then there is no turning back."
1,Catulli Carmina and Trionfo Di Afrodite is substandard to Carmina Burana,"The greatest appeal of Orff's Carmina Burana is O Fortuna. It is among the most powerful and deep compositions of classical music. There is a significant percentage of the fans of Carmina Burana who loose interest in the rest of the music. They should not buy parts two and three of the Trionfi. Nothing resembles O Fortuna in Catulli Carmina nor Trionfo Di Afrodite. For the rest of us who like the sublimeness of the other scores in Carmina Burana, Catulli Carmina and Trionfo Di Afrodite has little to offer. None of the scores have the depth, power nor sweetness of any of the Carmina Burana scores. It offers only sour notes, operatic dialog and no memorable melodies"
3,Good Show,"I loved this miniseries when it first came out and was excited to see it again. My problem is my husband is hard of hearing and we need close captioning and this didn't have it so I had to watch it with the stereo on full blast so he wouldn't miss anything and I still think it is a good miniseries, I had never seen Hugh Grant as such a villian, a great step out of the norm for him. The rest of the cast was great too. I hummed the theme for two days after watching it because you hear it over and over. The definition on the DVD was bad too, it was grainy on our flat panel, I guess it was made before the LED TV generation."
2,It s the same thing,"If you don't own a book like this then buy it. If you've EVER read one of these type books then forget it. It's the same thing you read in every other ""preparedness"" book. I'm sure this was the HOT seller Dec. 31, 1999, but now?Rent a movie....."
5,If you could have only one programming book...,"This is my choice for the answer to the question ""If you were stranded on a deserted island and you could have only one programming book which book would you choose?"". Over the years I have periodically returned to this book to read or work through for fun. ""The AWK Programming Language"" may be from 1988 but it is still outstanding! It has an incredible amount of depth for a book of only 200 or so pages. Well-written, concise, with great examples. Truly an enjoyable book to work through."
1,Poor customer service,Item is not as nice as it appears. Company was completely unresponsive. Don't recommend.
5,The best ever,This is the most amazing hardcore/metal album ever recorded.I wish somebody would reissue it so it wasn't so expensive.Amen.
3,Its oooookay.....,"This alblum came out in 92, but the alblum before this is way, way heavier, it is there self titled alblum ""The Crucifed"" if you like bands like ""Slayer"" check out ""Living Sacrafices"" first alblum...2 Timothy 3:1-5"
2,Better Read in 1993,"Notes From The Country Club by Kim Wozencraft -- written in 1993, this is a novel about a woman who eventually kills her abusive husband. The book opens with the reader finding her in the psychiatric evaluation section of a Texas jail. For about 2/3s of the book, Wozencraft did a good job of creating characters, a sense of mind and a sense of place. However, about the last 30-40 pages of the book were given over to polemnical-type statements/rants of paragraph-length coming from the characters. It was really tiresome and boring at that point. Part of the problem may be that what was news in 1993 no longer is vis-a-vis battered women. The other problem is stepping away from the character and deciding the reader needed some learnin' and doing it through lecturing the reader."
5,Top flight !,"The New Columbian's albums are few, but each is a gem of professionalism and discipline. The album entitled, ""Music from America's Golden Age"", is my favorite,(although the ""Coney Island"" and ""Thatsumrag"" recordings are excellent, as well. The ensemble plays with brightness of sound and approach. They actually sound as though they're enjoying themselves. Vincent DiMartino's cornet playing on ""Carnival of Venice"" is full of Arban and DelStaigers quotations, yet manages to come-off as totally original. What a Master Class is his performance. Finally, ""The Billboard"" March is taken at close to the exciting tempo as marked. This recording does it justice as the Circus March it was intended to be."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!,"This album does not represent the true Gato by any stretch of the imagination. This artist has done some truly magnificent work with most of his other albums but this one sounds more like some very stale Latino musician wannabe's. Please don't let this discourage you from the artist, only this cd."
1,Who can like this crap,"For starters let me say I like blood, gore and violence as much as the next hacker fan, but are we all so bored that we have to watch this kind of trash, what has happened to story lines that make since. So they let us get to know the characters and the psychotic killer bitch a little bit and that's suppose to make this thing worth watching. The attempt at humor was very weak and no one had any chemistry with one another. Save your money with this one, unless you just get off on watching a chick slaughter people for no reason, (Plus one baby off camera) but I guess there are some viewers out there who like this crap or these dumbass movies wouldn't be made."
2,Lots of gore but not too much more.,"This movie delivered gore and all that but the script is stupid, the acting is bad and the movie was a waste of my time."
1,Say What ?,"How on earth could this lump of excrement get over a 2 star rating by anyone outside of the folks involved in the making of this ""movie"" is beyond me.I as a movie watcher enjoy a good torture porn as much as the next horror fan but when the movie makes no since and has the most jumbled up bunch of parts that are just thrown together to make a story it just will not work. If you can make since of this POC I will be very surprised.The acting is over the top bad on all sides and I pray to god I never see the lead actress face again. Take my word for it this is a total waste of your time."
2,Horrible low budget stinker,This straight to dvd movie is about as low budget as it gets. At first I thought one of the supporting characters had killed her off. Then the movie moves ahead like it never happened. Most of the special effects look very fake and cheaply made. They are so fake it ruins the hint of gore I was expecting. The main character actress does a fare job but this about the only redeeming quality in this hole movie.
1,One of the worst movies in the history of movies,"Holy smokes, how does stuff like this get greenlit? I can only imagine people who worked on this terrible waste of film gave it its good reviews because no one with half a brain including gore-loving teenagers could find this thing remotely entertaining.Everything that can be bad about a movie is here - bad acting, bad directing, bad acting - it stinks to high heaven. It's not even Showgirls bad where it's so bad you can make fun of it - this guy thinks he's made a good movie.If you value your time, do not waste it on this garbage. I wouldn't even recommend getting it bittorrent or borrowing it for free because you will be mad at yourself for wasting time on it. It's quite possible the worst movie ever made and I'm pretty tolerant when it comes to a lot of bad movies. Hopefully everyone involved with this production will be banned from movies forever."
5,Twofold,"Mahmoud Darwiche and Marcel Khalife were bound to meet one day, not only because of the eternal marriage between music and poetry, but also because of their common political ideology. They simply match."
1,GPX JUNK,I got a GPX CD player for Christmas and it broke the 2nd time I used. TARGET wouldn't exchange it becuase I didn't have a receipt (It was a dang Christmas present!) I called GPX and they wanted me to ship the player back to them which cost $10 and mail them a check for $15. So it would cost me another $25 to replace it. GPX makes lousy products. You would have to be a FOOL to buy this product.
1,"Good Product at first, then becomes a piece of junk!!","When I first got the DVD Player for Chirstmas 2 years ago, I was amazed by the clarity of the picture. Then a year later, the player went bad, first stopped reading one dvd disc, then a few, now all. The player used to play those dvds but now cannot get a picture from the player. The DVDs could play easily in my PANASONIC DVD-LV750 PORTABLE much better than the GPX product. A portable simply did better than this product, that is no excuse. Simply, the product went bad just like many cheap, off-brand items do."
5,as good as component video dvd players,"i mainly was using this for the karaoke features, but when i compared the svideo output against my toshiba sd1600 that has component video outs hooked up to my toshiba 65"" hdtv widescreen, i saw no difference. i looked at the same movies, same scenes and the picture was great!!! i was truly amazed. plus it has vcd, svcd and karaoke features that my toshiba didn't have. now my toshiba sd1600 is collecting dust while my gpx gets shelf on the entertainment center!"
2,Save your money!!!,"What a disappointment!The only saving grace is the Bonus Track. The rest of the CD is boring.I was hoping for the same sonic and composition quality as Michael Stearns ""The Lost World"".Buy The Lost World! It is a sonic masterpiece...http://www.amazon.com/Lost-World-Michael-Stearns/dp/B000000X6W"
4,Good book for beginners,"Got this book in a decent condition. It had no tracking, would have been better if the item had tracking. The book starts with the crudest basics and goes into fairly detailed topics, giving sufficient, but not detailed, information about each topic. It's a good book to start drawing but it's definitely not the end."
1,"Great book, lousy edition","Having misplaced my earlier printing of this book (by the University of Nebraska Press) I ordered the Kessinger Publishing, LLC release of this title, only to be terribly disappointed. The Remington drawings are so poorly reproduced that some appear as blacked-out, scarcely discernable blobs, rather than the wonderful sketches they originally were. This printing appears to be a very poorly-reproduced copy of earlier ones, with much quality lost. Find a copy of the extremely attractive Nebraska (Bison) edition instead."
2,"Reprint text OK, but large; Illustrations very over-exposed","The reprint publisher appears to have simply photo-copied an original edition, upsizing it to a larger format. The print is large and easy to read, anyway - I don't need my reading glasses. Not sure why they printed it in the larger format - there doesn't seem to be a good reason for it. I was extremely disappointed in the reproduction quality of the Frederic Remington illustrations - the simple line drawings came out OK, but the more complicated pictures are rendered so dark that all detail is lost - some are almost totally black. If you want the Remington illo's, in addition to Roosevelt's excellent text, look for a different edition than this one (Kessinger Legacy Reprints)."
2,There's a better edition that's less expensive,"What a great book - too bad the reproduction in this hardcover is not so good. TryRanch Life and the Hunting Trailfor an edition of this book with crisp illustrations, It's less than half the price brand new."
5,"Great Price, excellent performance",I put a K&N; on everything I drive. From the trucks to the V-rod and now the Fat Boy Lo......I just use the K&N; filters that fit the stock airbox on all my unit. This kit fit into the 2012 FLSTFB perfectly.Lifetime air cleaner for a great price. Fast shipping.
5,Filtre à air de remplacement,Fit parfaitement sur mon FLHRS 2007 donne un peux plus de pouvoir au moteur et donne une chance aux 50/50
1,K&N HD 1499 air filter,Did not use this air filter ordered the wrong one. I'm sure it would have been great. I have a K&N filter on all of my rides.
5,The Best Audio Tape Ever!,"This audio tape recorded by Ruby Dee of Zora Neale Hurston's Mules and Men absolutely makes the case for audio-books because of Dee's extraordinary performance. I seriously doubt that Hurston could do better herself. It is so great that this is the third time I am buying it. The first two copies are owned by my Mom (artist Faith Ringgold) who is bi-coastal and keeps a copy loaded in the tape player ready to play, day or night, on each coast, and the third is for me because now from listening to my Mom's tapes I am as addicted to it as she is. This is becoming true of a lot of her friends. Whether you are doing something else or just listening, it fits in perfectly, and it is full of wisdom and laughs. It is absolutely the best, and I would buy anything else that Ruby Dee ever had anything to do with because she is the glue that makes it work."
4,Great outline of African-American culture and folklore,"There are several things that make this book very enjoyable. One is the collection of folklore and ""hoodoo"", obtained from first-hand information. Ms. Hurston went to Florida for several months to gather her collection of folklore, and then to New Orleans for several more to study under various witchdoctors to gather the ""hoodoo"" information. Another is that she details her trips to these places. The stories aren't just written out and numbered; you know exactly who told them and under what conditions. I found this really helped me identify with the story much more. Finally, I'm from small-town Florida, and several of the places mentioned were very familiar to me. It's always nice to read a fellow-Floridian's work."
4,AMAZING GAME!! until...,"I started playing the Superstar mode and it is FANTASTIC!! Now, you get full control of YOUR player moving him along the field and not the old way where you only controlled the ball carrier. This game is a more hands-on approach to your preferred position and helps you get INTO the game.UNTILI turned my PS2 off, went to eat, and tried to load the game. Guess what? FILE CORRUPTED!! I dont know what the heck happened... So i had to start all over again, and delete the corrupted file. I dont know if it will harm other files but BEWARE!!!"
1,Corruption of Memory Card,"This is the first year I have purchased Madden since the PS1. I was very happy with the product. Graphics were astounding and tackling moves were improved. By far EA seemed to improve very many things from 2006. But, I just finished my offseason for the 2nd year and tried to load Franchise to start 3rd season and got a Corrupt File message. This was the second time I have gotten this message. It was a Corrupt Settings file 2 times and a Corrupt Profile save the third time. The first time I deleted the Settings file--Problem Solved. Wrong. Got 2 more corrupted files: Settings and Profile. I was able to delete Settings file again, but, Profile Save said unable to Delete. It then deleted every file on my memory card. To my knowledge there is no way to fix this glitch. BEWARE OF THE GLITCH."
2,PS2 Madden 2007,"I find this game to be very indepth when it comes to the ability to change formations and plays just by what you see. However, my major disappointment comes from the graphics. I understand the ps2 doesn't not have the standards of the XBox360, but this was false advertising showing this very detailed game and not showing which system this ran for. I just hope when the ps3 comes out, Madden will rerelease the game for it to give the XBox360 owners something to whine about. EA should be more infomational in giving what things look like to the consumer rather then just showing the best picture they have."
3,Is this Next Gen?,"The positives:- player models- gameplay- lead blocker- superstar modeThe Negatives- No Fantasy Draft- No Madden (Play by Play is a joke)- No ESPN integration- No Online Leagues- No Online Fairplay- No Franchise radio show/news/updates- Major Bugs, including no fatigueOverall, I'm pretty disappointed with this release. 2007 is not as big as a disappointment as Madden 2006, but its close. The Madden series peaked with 2005, which subsequently was the last year they had any competition.. Coincidence? Hardly! The quality of this game is a result of EA having no competition through its purchase of an exclusive license."
4,Great simulation,"This game is great if you're like me and prefer to run the team and call the plays. I never buy sports games to play against the computer because eventually you beat them with any team....but the coaching mode in this game is very good. I have called the plays and controlled the roster on my team through 6 weeks and have found the stats to be very realistic and the games are tense and hard fought to the end. I can't write a review on the game play because I prefer being the coach. Game looks very similar to last year's graphics wise. My main complaint is that training camp is still the same, would it kill the developers to have some new drills after 4 years of the same thing?? I'm sick of ""pocket presence"" already. Overall great game though, from roster control all the way to field action."
5,Madden's Football Review,My kids love the football game. It's great for all age groups. The graphics are great and fun to play.
2,Nothing new,I have bough the Madden games for many years and find this years to be one of the worst. They have made very small updates and besides having the new player rosters I see no reason to be playing the new version. I am insulted by the company and feel as if they are trying to sell games off the brand they have created behind the name Madden. I also bought NCAA 07 this year and although they are somewhat the same I find that Madden is far behind of this game. Don't wast your money on this game. I am upset I wasted mine. Madden 07 also has lot's of issues with the game freezing in season mode-
1,Another trip to the well.,"Waiting in line to buy the new Madden every year is like waiting in line to buy a new calendar. Sure, there are enough differences to technically call it ""new"". There might be newer or prettier pictures but it's still just a calendar, just like the year before - same stuff only with slight changes. I know all the Maddenphiles and football fans say that there really are additions and changes that justify another $50/$60 drop. I think they tell themselves that just so they don't feel ripped off. Now that online play is a regular part of console gaming, EA should just have yearly download updates and charge $15 or so. Oh but wait, there's no money in not screwing over the consumer."
2,Another Madden...,"Once again another Madden has been created. Very few new features.Graphics:3/10Same as always2-D crowdSemi-realistic playersI'm still waiting for something new SonySound:8/10One positive thing about Madden is its great musicControls:8/10Same as alwaysSuperstar Mode:5/10Not the biggest fan of playing it in first person unless you are the quarterback. With any other offense position, there is a 900% chance that a running play will be called. And if you are a running back, 1000% chance that a run won't be called.Defense is cool, but it's easy to lose track of your surroundings fast.Playability:Moderately-highOverall:7.5/10It seems that Madden adds like 1 thing per year; with the first person Superstar view this year.Personally I'm good with Franchising my team every year and creating players on there.My recommendation:With the release of Madden 08 coming out, don't bother."
1,Unplayable,"Unfortunately, I purchased this game last Friday. While I did thoroughly enjoy the first 30 minutes of Play Now I was rudely interrupted at half time when my game froze. Being the patient man I am I reset the system and began a fantasy draft, while this went off without a hitch (other than the ridiculously large 1,411kb required to save my franchise) I was soon interrupted.During my first game in franchise mode my game froze again, this time more irritating than the last, as I lost all of my training camp data. I restarted and decided simply to play another Play Now game, only to have the game freeze on the loading screen. I reset and decided to start over on my training camp when, much to my surprise, the game froze once more on the loading screen.So, I implore you, unless you are ridiculously patient, or ridiculously fanatical about this game stick with 2006."
2,Wish The NFL would switch to 2K instead of Madden,"Each year I hope Madden gets better; for it is the only NFL game licensed, but it's always the same damn thing. Another let down in my opinion. I just don't get why the NFL had to license it's video games to just EA? 2k was making a great footabll games every year and the great thing was the 2k series was only $19.99. If you loved madden 04, 06 & 06, I'm guessing you'll love this too,, if you did not like those,, stay away from 07 too.. Maybe next year?"
3,great game but 1 HUGE!!!!!!!! problem,the game is great superstar mode and all but there is 1 major glitch. when u save your superstar or franchise mode after your 2nd yr the save file gets corrupted it doesnt work and u cant delete it. i have done 3 of these and i had 2 get a new game and memory card (make sure u keep the receipt)
3,No competition hurts this franchise.,"Madden 2005 and ESPN NFL 2K5 are still the best football games for current gen. systems. Since the buy out I played both previous and current Madden games. Not bad but nothing special either. Not a lot of insentive to push out a great game without someone sneaking up behind you with something better. Outside the roster updates and the upgraded truck stick the game is average everywhere else. The whole o-line takeover seems like a generic gimmick thrown in to give the game something innovative. Hopefully with the rest of the next gen. systems coming, next years Madden will not only have improved graphics but improved gameplay. Mediocracy is not the standard that America's greatest sport gaming franchise should live by. Bring back competition."
3,Awesome game but lags ALOT,the game is awesome but in superstar mode it just shuts down all the time. once you get past one season it won't let you play a game. Great fun but EA needs to work on it.
3,No better than '06,"While this is a great game, there are no real advantages or great upgrades over the previous year's game. I actually think the SuperStar mode is less fun because of the new perspective during the plays, and the annoying ""role picking"" before each drive. I would just as soon go back and play the '06 version for much less money, after updating the rosters. Overall a great game, as you would expect from the Madden series, but if you are looking to buy this for yourself save the money and purchase an '06 for less.I have also had memory card problems with this game (as other reviwers have noted) where it has corrupted for no apparent reason, losing the entire season."
4,Good BUT...,"Typical Madden quality we're used to seeing with some cool new features but 2 main negatives to this game:1. You can't import your playbook into franchise mode or superstar mode.. major bummer. - what's the point of creating a playbook you can only use in 1 on 1 exibition mode? If I am correct, I believe 2006 had the same problem, but 2005 you could import the playbook.. unless I am doing something wrong??2. Superstar mode: only one view to choose from... too bad. When I am trying to play as a running back in this mode the view is just too narrow, you can't see the guys until they are right on top of you which really makes it impossible to run well. Give us some options with the game camera in this mode next time.3. In coach mode there could be a coach cam- similar to what the demo camera used to look like in older madden versionsStill a solid game though"
3,No help at all!!!!!!!,Unfortunately this game wouldn't play so I can't review it!Seller (Leet Games) is absolutely brilliant though - fixed the issue with no problems at all. Would highly recommend this seller.
2,"Pleaz, this game is trash","The Madden franchise is going down the wrong road with this stupid QB vision stuff and on top of that gameplay is way 2 slow. Last years game was good because u had the option of turing off QB vision without effecting the level of gameplay but now in 2007 if u turn off QB vision u can only play on All Pro and not on All Madden...stupid. By doing that it means, ""play the way we me made the game or don't play at all."" Fine I won't play and Im sure a lot of other gamers made the same decesion."
5,A Real Gem!,"This cd is a rare jewel. You don't come across sounds and vocals like this often today. I felt the songs spoke to me personally and the messages came through loud and clear. The musicianship is extraordinary and the lead singer is not only extremely talented but his voice cuts through your deepest emotions. I've listened to this CD a skillion times and each play reveals even more musical genius. If the songs CONSCIENCE AND BROTHER OF MINE don't make the charts, I'll eat my hatand my girl friends's too. Here's to one of the best new songs to arrive on the horizon in a long time. I heartily recommend this CD and know you'll just make it a close friend."
4,Good Layout Solutions,"This was a good suprise. The book have so many good references and ideas. it's well explained and the book layout is very nice also. Well, we all know that Rockport Publishers rocks!"
3,I couldn't get into it.,Maybe on a different day or in a different frame of mind I'd be able to read this book. ........
5,A fantasy classic from the 1920's still in print!,"This was a notorious book of the 1920's, and it describesthe odyssey of Jurgen, a middle-aged pawnbroker and a""monstrous clever fellow"", who is miserable with his wife,and one day he is given an opportunity to search throughmany realms of fantasy and imagination looking for theperfect mate. The book is an ironic exploration of man'sperennial dissatisfaction. Plenty of angst, but alsoa lot of humor and fun.Opening line: ""In the old days lived a pawnbroker namedJurgen, but what his wife called him was very often muchworse than that. She was a high-spirited woman, with noespecial gift for silence."" If you like that line, readthe book. If you don't, then forget it."
5,An Intellectual Romp in the Hay,"Magically recovering his youth, Jurgen, a poet-cum-pawn broker of medaeval France, begins an erotic odyssey, in which he beds King Arthur's bride-to-be, a love goddess in her realm of pleasure, a tree nymph, the queen of Philistines, a vampire in Hell. He also gets to talk to God, Satan -- and the mysterious Katschei, creator of all things as they are. Full of puns, word play, references to obscure myths and legends of various cultures, and Americanizing the tradition of the picaresque epic, JURGEN is a delight for the Mensa set and ordinary readers alike. This edition reproduces the delightful illustrations cut for the first British publication of the work."
4,pass the courvoisier 2/shut2002 busta rhymes,ilove the music make you want to dance. take you back to old schoolparties. called sets. and back yard bbq's . being a real O G.
2,Helping yourself is never easy,"The workbook is designed to help you through the Six Steps of Inner Bonding, & I was using it with the book that goes with it. I just found the whole process too much for me, too difficult, as I cannot connect with the spiritual guidance they find necessary to progress in the work. I guess if you are able to do that & work at the process consistently, it can be of use. I just gave up."
2,Not what I'd hoped,"I was very startled when I received this edition of the book - there is no publishing information in it! It looks and feels like someone's dissertation - the font looks like it came from an old typewriter, the pages are huge, and it just looks, well, typed. Not at all conducive to sitting down and reading."
2,Too many errors,"I love this book, but there were numerous errors in the text which made it almost illegible. I had to buy a different version."
5,Very interesting period piece,"Very interesting view of the period. Amazing how society has evolved, yes, editing mistakes - but it was FREE"
5,Trollope literature,"I've enjoyed the Phineas series and am enjoying this one, also. I liked the cover of the book. Though, if I had a preference it would be for a book with the notes inbedded to illuminate some words or phrases that I was not familiar with."
1,Poor,"I am an avid fan of classic radio, but this collection is the worst I have encountered of this genre."
4,Beautiful voice!,"I like her French arias recording. When Ms. Dessay sings French arias she sings flawless. But when she sings Mozart, I just don't like her vibration on mid keys, because sometimes it's not flowing fast enough, little bit unpleasant to the ear."
3,Good Music - COPY PROTECTED!,"Yes, this CD is ""copy protected"" - I can't play it on my computer. So watch out. If you use your CD-ROM drive a lot for playing music CDs, you will be disappointed; on the other hand, if you only use your audio CD setup, I warmly recommend the disc."
1,"These are 40-packs, not 60-packs",I bought these trying to save on packaging--usually they are sold as 40 count. The company sent me 40 packs instead. So this is false advertising.
3,I got real tired of the heroine's behavior,"The Black Angel (Isabel Atherstone)is out to seek revenge on James, the Earl of Bolton. She blames him for his father gravely wounding her father in a tournament. She has few if any female traits: dresses as a man, swaggers like a man, sword fights like a man. James has the patience of a saint. If I read one more chapter where Isabel humiliates James I think I would have put the book down. If you read the story you will also see that the front cover gives a totally inaccurate picture of the hero. Are the cover artists or publishers afraid to show a less then perfect hero?"
3,Ma Jian portrays a country without soul,"Is it just Ma Jian or is China so bereft of soul that people have a one dimensional inner life? Contrast this with the stories of the poor in Appalachia by Barbara Kingsolver, in Prodigal Summer where relationships between people are rich, and where the idea of cremating one's very alive mother for the experience of it would be beyond contemplation.I have traveled in China both before and after Ma Jian's stories took place and did not find the nihilism he portrays to be particularly prevalent. His satire is perhaps on a par with Voltaire's Candide, but I don't find it particularly illuminating. Even people who navigate the shoals of the Cultural Revolution, the Great Leap Foreward and The Great Awakening have depths and his portrayal robs them of any dignity."
3,'I want to turn their lives into a work of art although I am sure they will never bother to read it',"Two old friends - a professional blood donor (a profit seeker) and a state employed writer (an idealist) - meet up for a regular dinner. The latter compains about his latest assignment: a book about a Communist hero. He yearns to write about other people:'A young entrepreneur who runs a private crematorium; an illegal migrant who writes letters for the illiterate; a father who spends his life trying to get rid of his retarded daughter...These are people he knows, has read about or sees every day on the streets...But he is fully aware that if he wrote about these sad and feeble characters, his leaders would consider him unfit for the post of professional writer'.In a series of interlinked short stories, the writer tells the stories of these characters...An excellent translation by Flora Drew. Interesting read although sometimes I felt the hidden meanings escaped me!"
2,Best Motoring,"The DVD says it was released on '08, but one part inside the DVD I already saw it 2 years ago in a public and free video web site. The DVD looks like a clone. It's very short and didn't contain any professional completition, except for a several lap races testing european and japanese cars."
3,"Some Gems, Some Throw Aways","This live album contains a beautiful versions of ""French Inhaler"" and ""Hasten Down the Wind"" back to back, two of Zevon's best ballads. It also has and interesting, if drawn out, version of ""Rolland the Headless Thompson Gunner"" merged with ""Boom Boom Mancini.""The main problem with this album is Zevon's blaise renditions of his biggest radio hits, ""Lawyers, Guns and Money,"" and, of course, ""Werewolves of London."" He zips through both numbers as if he is only playing them because he has to."
5,It's a wonderfull CD!,"I could not buy this CD in Holland. So I bought it by Amazon.It's so nice to listen to Warren ""live""."
2,"Stand in the Fire, this ain't","I love the Z-man. And it hurts me to give him a sub-par review. However, this one-man live act is a bit on the dull side. Hey, Warren, don't forget that you're a rocker!!! Also, for someone as sardonic and cynical and cutting edge as Zevon, why would he release a live album that recalls the tepidness of all those damned MTV unplugged cds?"
3,it's good but the studio versions are better,"I like this cd but it is really for hard core fans of Zevon. The stripped down versions (either just guitar or piano) take away rather than energize the songs.In my opinion, his work is about the lyrics rather than the music. I have alwasy liked the production and arrangements of Zevon's albums.On the other hand, Zevon plays the 12 string accoustic guitar quite effectively. I never knew how talented and vibrant his playing could be.The cd has a good selection of his best songs and acts as a comprehensive compilation. A superior move would be to get a greatest hits cd of the studio versions.The piano songs work well but the guitar ones are way too sparce."
5,Masterful,"I purchased this because I had heard many of the pieces before but felt that the interpretations were pale and limp and so I took the chance that this master player would breathe life into them. I was not in any way disappointed. Perlman has a wonderful touch with his instrument and knows these pieces intimately. His playing is breathtakingly beautiful and far superior to any other versions that I have heard. I recommend this CD highly - especially in a peaceful, quiet setting where you can savor each wonderful melody."
3,blackberry screen savers,this item does fit the 8310 but it is not a perfect fit as the ad describes
3,ScreenGuardZ,"These screen guards are ultra-slim. They come with a little plastic card to help smooth out the air bubbles, but it's hard to get all of the air bubbles out. A little thicker product may work out better, but they do protect your screen and I do not notice any additional glare."
3,Doesn't teach you the Tools!,"I have not found a single Six Sigma book that really teaches you the tools you are going to use. All of the authors asume that you should already know them or that you are going to buy other books. When is someone going to write a complete Six Sigma book? Not just the stuff for the managers, but how to do QFD, how to do SPC charts, how to do FMEA, how to do ANOVA, etc. If they dedicate 20 pages to the strategic phase it is more than enough, because what is difficult to learn are all the math and statistics needed. The best one I have read is the George Eckes book, but it also misses a lot."
4,Clear Sailing to Port,"The presentation, layout and graphics allows for an easy read and ability to navigate through the basics of 6 Sigma.It is suitable for Senior Management, Champions and Green Belts. Master Black Belts and Black Belts will find theelectronic book/CD version helpful and the electronic Six Sigma Knowledge Base (due to be released later this year) even more helpful for statistical and data tools.This version of the book, could well serve as the foundation for your workbook for training purposes. The templates, case studies and sample forms are helpful for basic planning.I found the chapters on the first 6 months, Selecting a Project and DMAIIC (where the extra I is for Implement) helpful when presenting to Management and Champions.The book has a style that can also be used for training and informing employees who are not familiar with 6 Sigma.Looking forward to the Six Sigma Knowledge Base when released."
3,Half-There,"The book clearly develop's the Six Sigma implementation method. It will be very useful to me in the future. However, right now, I need a more fundamental introduction to the statistical tools employed in defining a Six Sigma project.This book tells which tools to use, and when to use them, but it does not explain HOW to use them. Unfortunately, I am in the position of not knowing the HOW. Perhaps I would do better with a course int Statistical Analysis."
5,excellent,BUENO ESTE ES UN DISCO COMPACTO EL CUAL YO QUERIA CONSEGUIR DESDE HACE YA UN BUEN TIEMPO PARA MI COLECCION PERSONAL
4,difficult but very nice,"another consistantly quality release by the material purist. this time all sounds come from a copy of the bible (if you're asking what makes the bible sound different from other books? the answer is that special thin paper only bibles are printed on). I'd love to see a video of this guy generating and composing sometime, (in this case rubbing contact mics, ripping and tearing); but not knowing how he does it does not take away from the beauty of these subtle and immersive sound environments.PS what the hell are these PS prices all about? I find copies of Aube's work in local record stores from time to time at normal prices..."
3,Slicker but not better,"You Are (Not) Alone certainly is a shinier version of the first handful of episodes of the now decade old Neon Genesis Evangelion, but something isn't right about it. The new animation and CG enhancements add a lot of visual flare but like any movie-ized version of an episodic story you lose some of what made the series interesting and special. You lose the cliff henger endings, you lose the nuances in the quiet moments, you lose the interplay between the comedy and series elements and you lose the slowly unraveling mythology. And what is left is on paper the same story but feels more like a long recap episode."
5,the masterpiece...again,"Well, this must be the 5th release of Evangelion in the last decade, but as such, is a nice re-imagining of the classic story. This is the first six Evangelion episodes smooshed into a movie, remastered for widescreen and lovely to look at. It cuts out some sidearc BS in favor of the action, I understand this is part 1 of a 4 part movie series, so I'm quite looking forward to Part 2"
5,You now have a new fan,I really enjoyed this film even though I've never seen its sequels or the other films before it. Great film by the way and I will be getting the other films too.
3,This book is a mixed bag....,"This book provides some valid insights on the nitty gritty of mothering young children, but I think that Ms. Krasnow's ""surrender"" sounds a lot like the many other episodes of revelation she's experienced in love, religion and work - intense and temporary.The fact that she has a profession that allows her to work freelance and from home, and that her husband supports her in a lifestyle that also provides for a part-time nanny, makes me question the extent of her ""surrender"". Although she professes a respect for other women's choices, the message of this book is that anything less than a stay-at-home mother represents a disservice to one's children. As a full time professional and mother of 8&10 year old children, I don't buy it - and given that Ms. Krasnow managed to pump this book out between egg-scraping episodes - I don't think she really does either."
3,The essence of motherhood: truth for career women,"The author hits me where I live. Iris Krasnow reflects to me the conflict between being career driven and following my heart and probably my biology. In the early days of motherhood I rapidly forgot why I ever worked late in the evenings or on weekends. Eventually, I could not imagine leaving my baby for few hours. It absolutely felt like I was surrendering to my destiny: mommy and nurturer of the family. In several different ways, the author attaches words to this emotional shift that a new baby creates, and out of the storm she finds that there is a logical truth. We are here to be companions and guides to the children that we create. When we can be clear about our own drives, we find that focusing on the little people in our lives is our fullfillment and never a sacrifice"
1,"""Surrendering to indulgences "" should be the apt title",This book is nothing but HEIGHTS of Hippocrisy and audacity by an upper class lady who has slept with all the men in the world and ultimately by the age of 40 produces 4 kids and hires a full-time nanny cum house keeper andstill manages to make millions by writing crap stuff ....She frequently quotes Baba Dass and other Spiritual Teachers to make us feel she is an intellect .Don't waste your precious time reading 200 pages of non-sense .This is just a biography of this hippocrite self indulgent upper class woman.That's it !
2,yawn,"Women old enough to remember the l950's will realize there's nothing new here. Anyone who thought the backlash was over will revise her thinking after reading this book.Krasnow waxes poetic on the subject of stay-at-home motherhood and makes a few good observations. What she doesn't do is explain what the woman who sacrifices all for family is supposed to do if she finds herself a single mother with a husband who doesn't pay child support, or a 55-year-old displaced homemaker with nothing to show for her troubles but an ex-husband who's found a younger model and grown children who seldom phone. The author fails to explain why only women are expected to put themselves in this precarious position. I could have sworn it took two people to create a child.One senses a certain amount of dishonesty here, in that the author has managed to turn out a book while preaching the joys of total self-surrender to family.To be fair, Krasnow writes well. If only she had something to say..."
2,"Long, bragging, and she didn't really solve anything.","Some of her stories are interesting, but I quickly got bored of her mentioning the same star's names over and over. She seems to enjoy name dropping. I also didn't understand why she jumped into marriage and childbirth and then did her motherhood vs career soul searching. I don't think she really solved her problems. Whats she going to do and feel when her boys grow up?"
3,just o.k.,"I bought this book because I'm a huge fan of Surrendering to Marriage. After reading it, I was left feeling like there should have been more. It was more about her personal transition, whereas Surrendering to Marriage was larger in scope. Not as inspirational or encouraging as I had hoped, but still had a good theme: If you have children-BE THERE! Invest the emotion and effort it truly takes to raise a healthy (mind & body) human being."
1,I'd rather have my mind.,"This is pretty sickening. The title says it all -- losing your mind, finding your soul. If I were a mother, I would be insulted. So much for strong, independent womanhood."
2,Find this info elsewhere on the web for free,"Absolutely nothing that I didn't already know or that couldn't have been found elsewhere on the web with 5 minutes of googling.While it's comforting to know the info comes from a respected source, in the future I will be resisting the temptation to order any article summaries or encyclopedia topics. They are usually no more than one page, with little in-depth information. Don't do it...Anderson Analytics, LLC"
2,Let the Buyer Beware!,"This collection contains very passable bar room rhythm and blues, but if you are buying it to hear some interesting interplay between Mark Knopfler and Dave Edmunds, forget it! Mark Knopfler plays on only three of the albums 10 tunes, while Dave Edmunds input is limited to picking up instruments on only one of the tracks while producing/co-producing 4 others, none of them bearing the stamp of Knopflers trademark licks. If you have the money to burn, go for it. I think you'd be better served directing it towards any of either artists solo works."
1,Very small ice creams in very large boxes,"The title in bold caps proclaims ""MARK KNOPFLER & DAVE EDMUNDS,"" and in fine print below ""The Booze Brothers by Brewers Droop."" That should have been reversed. Someone is obviously trying to cash in on MK's subsequent success. Three early-70s tracks on which he allegedly picked but did not sing are the sole excuse for this album; it would not have sold without Knopfler's name on the cover. Nuf said. Unless you're dying to hear what he sounded like before he found his style."
2,not very creative,So I was expecting a lot more. This book does not have a big variety of skits like I hoped. It lacks creativity and doesn't give the skills needed to easily create your own. I was hoping it would give better suggestions for everyone to create a variety of skits. This is more like an intro and some ideas.
5,An excellent way to relax,"I am not an art critic or claim to have any expertise in art but I do find The American Art Book by Jay Tobler an excellent way to relax and view the world of art in compleley different setting. The compilation of artists is very complete and provides an outstanding cross section of artists within our american culture. As I read the book I can't help but think that each artist sat down with Jay and described to him in the artists words what the piece meant to them. The candor and symmetry of the writings are spendid and truly allow you to understand and relate to, not just the art work but also the artist."
3,"Good book, but missing some essential parts.....","As an art educator, there are many things I enjoyed about Jay Tobler's book....I appreciate the concise manner in which artist's works are dicussed,the artist cross-referencing feature and the good quality of the reproductions. The fact that such a 'tome' is so accessibly priced is a godsend....Unfortunately, in representing the scope of 'American' art per se, I do find it to be incredibly lacking. There exists hardly any representation of artists from minority groups in America....where are Native American artists, such as Pablita Velarde, and Jaune Quick-to-See Smith?...or important African Americans, such as James Biggars, or Bettye Saar?...to me,this book like may others, reinforces the notion that most 'important' artists in America are Anglo Saxon males. It is crucial, if we are looking at an overview of American art, to include ALL that is UNIQUELY American in creating a clear picture."
2,"Big pictures, little content","The representations are big and beautiful, but the text accompanying each image started sounding repetitive after a few dozen pages. Also, the choices from each artists oeuvre could be argued indefinitely, I suppose, but it seems to me if you have space for only one image, it should be their best work, (i.e. Chamberlain's ""nanoweap""?, Hopper's ""automat""? Etc., etc., eesh)All in all, it left me uninspired."
4,What fun she had,"Just wish these toys made of wood and other natural sources would last longer, it's a shame that the amount of work making these is ""destroyed"" so quickly."
4,Good read,"This is an enjoyable book that covers a lot of ground from Farragut's youth to shortly after the Civil War. Well written and hard to put down. For the Civil War history buff this book has a fair amount of information, written from the Union perspective, on the struggle to control the Mississippi River."
1,This thing is just plain bad!,"This is one of the worst things I have ever heard! This was recorded at a bar or some place in 1998, it is a live recording and in no way resembles the original American Woman album. It is more of a sad comedy CD than anything else. Note the name of the band is ""Guess Who"" not ""The Guess Who."" I had to force myself to play the whole thing. It is now in my trash can and I feel ripped off for buying it. It is a bad CD!"
2,it sounds bad 'cause it's a bootleg!,"this is a bootleg recording sold to an overseas lable, who released it as an authorized live cd. the cover doesn't even have a picture of the band, just some rca records glossy from the dominic troiriano era. it is a soundtrack from a date that was covered by some local t.v. station at an out door festival some where in the usa.this cd is proof positive why BANDS HATE BOOTLEGS!"
5,dirty child = major success,wow! this cd is great! the soul | hip hop | and all the toher amazing beats which are shown in this cd are great! the writting.. n one other than impecable... people do yourselves a favor ... let go of the stupid paulina rubiocd and check this out... its awesome!
3,"Fun pop songs, loose jazzy stuff not so good","I bought Rosey's album on the strength of *Beautiful*, which I picked up via Windows Media Player or somesuch thing. *Beautiful* is a good song indeed, and several more tracks on this album are creditable: Afterlife, Love, Like a Dream. But many tracks didn't work for me. Her style oscillates between fairly traditional pop music (her best) and loose, lightly structured jazz (not so good). And what was she thinking with the fake scratchy record effects on the last track, *My Baby*? I think I would have liked that song, except the recording technique makes my teeth hurt. My Rice Krispies make fewer popping noises.OK, this sounds like a negative review, but it's not. I've definitely purchased worse albums on the strength of a single song, and *Dirty Child* definitely met my expectations."
1,Like A Toad With A Cough,"Her voice is far too husky and choked up. Her lyrics stink.Wish I could return this album. She sounds a little like a female Bob Dylan, Johhny Cash but with a bad headcold."
1,Great idea but not a great product!,"Replaced our old tank water heater 2005. We are on our 3rd unit Power Star AE115. The first 2 were covered under warranty but finding someone to replace it was a hassle and each time cost $175 to reinstall. Now #3 has died. I'm done. Back to the old reliable tank water heater. Too bad because I did like the endless supply of hot water. You can not have 2 hot faucets going. So, 3 units in 4 years, not too good in my opinion. Buyer beware!"
2,AE125 PowerStar - No Thanks,"We are about 7 or 8 months into this water heater and have had it. We have fiddled with the temperature control enough. This weekend I am going to buy a old reliable conventional unit. We haven't had some of the horrendous problems others have reported. I think if I had, I wouldn't have put up with it for 8 minutes, let alone 8 months. But honestly, getting hot water shouldn't require all the gymnastics that are required to keep this thing adjusted - managing the flow rate, changing the temperature setting according to the seasons, resetting the little breakers when they trip - honestly. [...] If you like to tinker with the water heater all the time then maybe this is the unit for you. Especially if you like occassional cold showers in January and racing through the house bare-naked trying to see if the little red light is on. No thanks!"
1,Red Alert,"Purchased from CPO and found the unit took 27 seconds to have warm water delivered to my tap 2 feet away. When I contacted CPO for a refund, they said they needed to have an equiptment failure number given out from Bosch. I called Bosch and was on hold for 48 minutes before I was helped. The technicans said the 27 seconds for warm water to travel 2 feet is correct. My old hot water heater 25 feet away took the same amount of time. Check for your self, call Bosch technicians and see how long you have to wait to be helped before you purchase. CPO wouldn't take it back because I had installed the unit. In this case I had been better off lying to CPO than tell the truth. I now have a hot water heater that wastes water before it gets warm which is why I did away with my old hotwater heater in the first place. I hope you have better luck than I."
1,Very Poor Quality,"We bough this product a few years back, and it has been a constant headache. Even after it is fixed, it only works a month or two and then breaks down again.Most recently we have had to replace one element, and both thermal cutoffs, and the unit worked for about two months and failed again.Customer service involves long wait times, and with Bosch's new policy you need a professional before you can get technical help. That of course means a single failure, and all the electric bill savings go down the drain."
1,Don't buy Bosch,"Warranty - what warranty??? First they are impossible to get ahold of, I've called 3 times with over 2 hours of wait time, including getting disconnected, just to be told that the problem my technician is saying is the problem (a part under warranty) is not really the problem, it can't be! But regardless I have to have the tech come back out and walk thru the testing with Bosch on the line, at Bosch's convenience of course, to confirm it's a problem. Oh and then the tech will explain how my professionally installed & permitted water heater is installed to ensure that doesn't void the warranty, because of course professionally installed, permitted and finalled and inspected by PG&E doesn't mean anything. Meanwhile, please note, that I am paying for all of this nonsense with my time, stress and money, because technicians are not free. Long story short I'd rather pay for a tech & get any parts thru them and avoid Bosch altogether, I won't ever buy Bosch again!"
1,Broken machine multiple times,"We bought this water heater first over 2 years ago and have had our electrician friend install/work on maintenance with this product. We like that the unit saves space and is not using electricity when we are not home. However, we are now on our third machine that has broken on us and left us without hot water for weeks at a time. We originally did not have a water filtration system so the water heater corroded and needed to buy a new unit since it was our fault. We bought a brand new AE125 water heater, since then we have had no hot water multiple times due to the system breaking on us. When there has been an issue, it has taken hours to problem solve what is wrong, one can only reach the company from 8am-5pm, and it has taken days for them to ship a new unit or new part to us. After having no hot water for multiple days/weeks more than 3 times between 3 separate units, I would not recommend the product to anyone!"
1,Inferior product and NO company responsibility,"We purchased this water heater 3 years ago to save on energy costs and it stopped working! 3 years??? We spent several hundred dollars having the problem diagnosed (bad control board), several hundred more for the part (and only ONE company carried the part and had it in stock), and we will spend more having the part installed. Bosch needs to own up to their faulty product and replace these parts for free or refund the money for the entire water heater. We will never purchase another Bosch product."
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased this water heater because of its space saving feature and minimal electrical requirements and have regretted the purchase since. I was assured by the sales person this particular water heater would be perfect for my needs - very small house with one bathroom and small kitchen. I live in the panhandle of Florida where the climate is mild in the winter and steamy hot in the summer. The unit is installed in the linen closet inside the bathroom so it is not exposed to outside climate changes - which is apparently an issue in northern climates.The water has NEVER been above 100 degrees and is not consistently hot. The temperature fluctuates between somewhat hot and warm. I have spent hours on the phone with the technical support to no avail.If I had it to do over again I would have never purchased this unit and certainly would NOT recommend this water heater to anyone.
1,Recall it.,"Amazon, hello, with these kind of reviews you should drop this product for the sake of your own reputation. Signed : Stockholder."
1,Save your money,"You might as well take the cash you would spend on this product outside, throw it in your lawn, and mow over it....its truely a waste of money and Bosh customer service isn't much better! Long wait time on the phone and for replacement parts....they replaced our whole unit it broke again 6 months later and they said it wasn't under warrenty any longer since we bought the first one over a year ago????go figure!save your time, headach, and money"
1,Company owner,"Bad product, unit can't be consistant, cold, hot, cold, hot! You will be disappointed. If you have a well it will be worse, your pressure won't be consistant with out a regulator in the system. This was a mistake all the way around."
1,Junk...just pure junk,I purchased the refurbished larger AE125 unit. Did not wok right from the get go. Their warantee and customer support are a joke. I spent six hours....yes I said six hours.... on hold in three separate attempts to get help. When I finally did get a live person it was some clerical person who read from a script that required me to disassemble the unit and perform electrical tests that a regular person is not qualified to do. I gave up and reinstalled my old tank heater. anyone want to buy a tankless water heater cheap?
1,Big Waste of Money,I have replaced this unit 3 times in the last six months. They last on the average from 1 month to 3 months. I have replaced 5 units in all from Bosh and I would never ever recommend this product to anyone. The worst dicision I have ever made in a hot water heater.
1,A hack job of a book.,"The now photos have a lot of inaccuracies as noted by other reviews, but not only that, they seem to have been taken by an average joe with a point and shoot camera. In fact some look like they just stopped their car in the middle of an intersection and just snapped the picture from inside the car through the window.Overall, very disappointing."
1,OVER PRICED!,"After ordering quite a few of these in single double and triple switch versions and waiting quite some time for the order to arrive, well over a week, I found them at my local Lowes! Same manufacturer even!To my amazement they were about 2 dollars cheaper for each version. The plug plates were up to 3 dollars cheaper at Lowes as well. Luckily I had only ordered a couple of them on here. I wish I would have checked with Lowes first as I would have saved quite a bit of money on the product as well as shipping, not to mention the ability to do returns simply if I needed to at my local store!Do no waist your time buying them here. Go to Lowes!"
1,creepy and terrible,"creepy and terrible, this ""movie"" played like a reel of obsessed adults living far far away from the spotlight.do not watch this movie or rent it. you will be supporting bad filmaking"
5,Oregon Geographic Names,"Own this book if you love to take road trips in Oregon. Take it with you everywhere, because there is so much to learn just by looking and reading about a place you never thought about!This book is such a treasure. You can spend hours looking through it all. Its a wonderful database for places in Oregon you may not be able to read about online. Buy this if you research genealogy in Oregon. Very helpful to identify census localities etc."
5,Awesome book,We bought this book a few years back. Kid moved out and requested one for Christmas. Love the fact that he remembered how cool the book was. Can't beat the history. Neighbor borrowed and has already planned out his summer vacation. Thanks for all the work to accumulate the info.
1,no good,"I bought this camera a month ago, I purchased the 800mA power supply it called for. The night vision does not work. Contaced VideoSecu, they said I needed to purchase a 1000 to 2000mA from them, because ""the quality of the power supplies on the market is not the same"". Will not purchase anything from this company again."
5,underground sleepers,"This is the third time owning this LP...and if need to I'll search another copy down. Ec stays tru to the hip-hop heads with the,""Ill Breakers Anthem"" trak. peep the ""On Ill"" video to sample the life of the elements. Awsome production with samples that set the vibe, Hardcore B-Boys in the hood...If your into heavy beats with ill verbals that lace the track tight pick this one up."
5,Simply Fabulous,"In this collection, which appears to have come fairly soon after Women Who Run with the Wolves, Dr. Pinkola Estes tells us fairy tales, (which would be worth it alone, since her renditions are so good!), then speaks about their meanings. I have always been fascinated by Jungian interpretation of fairy tales and mythology, and here we have six discs or tapes doing just that! As usual, Clarissa Pinkola Estes manages to make the wisdom of the ages available to us here in the 21st Century, and to offer it in a thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining, incredibly inspiring, and always kind manner. Only danger in purchasing this set is that one must immediately order Volume 2, which is just as good! A treasure! Just as much a treasure as any gold found in the tales themselves!"
3,Abbey Road off with the sound man,"Really like the trueness of sound, very Beatles without the vocals, which is what I was looking for but at times the production quality is really lacking. Sometimes sounds like it was recorded in a garage and other times clean as can be."
2,Cup holders,"They were still a little too large for our boat, my husband needs to shave the holes on the boat to make them fit. It should not take to much effort but it would have been nice if they just slipped right in. I think they will be fine."
4,Totalmente Chido,"Even better than his previous CD ""Barrio Bravo"" Celso Piña gets truer to his roots and acoustic sound with this effort. Very different from ""Barrio Bravo"" this is a mainly acoustic small-combo showcase of acordeona and guacharaca with superb sound and style. Maybe you will miss the hard hitting numbers of the previous record but in this case the world music influences are totally integrated to Celso's style making something worthwile listening."
3,"Great for Learning... But No Way It's for Beginning Readers - a review of 'A Day at Greenhill Farm""","This is another good book from Scholastic. It deals with the many animals one might find on a farm. Cows, ducks, pigs, chickens, horses, geese, sheep and more, are all here and presented with eye pleasing photos.We see babies with their mothers, and have a chance to see what types of food they eat. (Baby animals nurse, of course.) We also get to see what a sheep looks like before, during, and after it is shorn.That said, there is no way that this is a book for just beginning readers. First there are too many words on some of the pages and some of the vocabulary is a bit sophisticated. Words like : orange, goslings, milking, through, webbed, oily, and noise.Three Stars. Good book with attractive pictures of farm animals. Should be of interest to older babies thru 1st Graders. I wouldn't purchase it as a beginning reader though"
2,Don't waste your money!,"This set of puzzles suffers from several faults... The grid squares are too large, the paper is too coarse, and even on some easy puzzles, you are forced to guess, in spite of the author's admonition that you should ""never guess!"" In addition, I found that some puzzles have ambiguous solutions... that is, they have more than one solution.The author should, at a minimum, have run these puzzles through a solver application (they can be found online) to eliminate the guesswork and multiple solutions."
2,Skip this title,"I have an addiction to this type of puzzle, but this book is the worst version of them that I have seen. Some puzzles cannot be solved by logic, but only by guesssing. Unless you have a serious addiction, skip this book for other titles in this genre."
2,So So,"I am not sure the author of this book understands the nature of the puzzles. Some puzzles listed as easy were not doable, some were very boring with no logic involved in solving, some had no starting point and some were good."
1,Horrible! Avoid this book!,"This is the WORST book on Hanjie I've ever seen. The author has tried to construct on the regular 5 block grids, but he can't seem to get the hang of it, so on almost every puzzle, you have rows and columns, sometimes up to three or four on each side, that you have to black out. This makes the 5 block grid almost useless for counting and placement. The easy puzzles are too easy and the hard puzzles have too many puzzles that you have to guess where to start. I am really, really sorry I wasted my money on this book, and I recommend that nobody else do it.The only reason I gave this book even ONE star is because Amazon won't let me do this review without a star rating. In reality I would rate it as a -3 stars!"
1,Worst,"The compiler, Timothy E Parker, has not even bothered to check that these pixel puzzles are solvable (let alone the degree of difficulty). While able to solve all puzzles in other books, I am stumped on number 66 for example, without being able to fill in a single cell! Other puzzles in this book are trivially easy.He even has the name of the book wrong - they are pixel puzzles, what on earth is Hanjie? And what makes him ""official""?Moreover, the example and strategies shown in the Introduction, do not even included the most basic techniques.""The world's most syndicated puzzle compiler""? Must refer to quantity not quality."
1,I feel alot better now,"I wish I had read the reviews from others earlier. But I do feel a lot better now.I had always been confident about my puzzle solving skills until I spent time on this book --- I couldn't believe that so many of them did require you to guess,(what's the point?!), or they left you clueless. I got so frustrated everytime I had to leave an unsolved puzzle behind and move on to the next one. I really started wondering if I was too dumb for this. Now I know they do require you to cheat...I'll just leave this book alone as soon as I get other puzzle books."
1,Don't bother!!,I have loved this type of puzzle for a long time. I wish that I would have checked the reviews before buying this book. I have found many of the same complaints as the other reviewers. Don't waste your money on this book.
2,Buy this book only if you're desperate for new Hanjie,"I'll keep this short. Buy this book only if you've gone through every other hanjie puzzle available to you. As other reviewers mentioned, some of the grids are way to big for the puzzle (lots of padding). But my biggest complaint by far is the fact that some of the puzzles are indeterminate. In fact, the very first puzzle I did in the book forced me to guess. I'm guessing this book was a quick cash-in by the author. Obviously, he didn't do his homework on this one."
1,Terrible at any price,The puzzles are not well thought out and must have been done in a hurry. Every other Hanjie book I have done is far better than this one. It's not even fun.
1,Hang ie more lik ie,I was disappointed with these puzzles. I have worked dozens of other puzzle picture books and this is the first that had a lot of odd solutions and blah pictures. I found too many of the pictures were not really solvable without something extra. I thought I was an advanced solver but when it came to this book I have my doubts.
1,Frustrating!,"I took this book on my vacation trip - it was a big mistake! It is absolutely frustrating. I spent so much time filling the large grids on poor quality paper only to find that the puzzles were either too easy or completely illogical. I have gone through two other books of Hanjie puzzles and have been able to solve the hardest of them without guessing or cheating; however, I found myself cheating on one of the first ""easy"" puzzles. I wish I would have read the reviews for this book before buying it. At least I can now skip the illogical ones and just complete the ones that make sense. I cannot recommend it to anybody in anyway!"
1,"Battery did not test did not work, I would like to know why this review showed up as four stars, I gave it one","I received the battery, it did not test, did not work I tried to test the battery , bought the same battery from a different source, and the customer is now satisfied.I would like to return the battery.I am very disappointed I will not buy from this source again..I GAVE THE PROCUCT A ONE STAR REVIEW, WONDER WHY IT SHOWED AS A FOUR STAR?????????"
3,Reference,I purchased this book solely as a reference for a report I was doing in college. It confirmed facts found in other books.
2,"Ok TV, but doesn't fully cut it","I use this to play video games, it's pretty good to use but the sound is just horrible! There is this buzz while playing, not a very reliable tv. The picture is good, all the inputs are there, overall an ok tv. Beware of sound if you really care for it."
3,OK...But Better Available.,"These are OK but I found the ""EAR 312-1223 TaperFit 2 Ear Plugs, Corded"" (also made by 3M) to have a better fit, much softer, more comfortable and with a higher 32dB rating. Also, it has a better plastic cord as opposed to the fabric stringy one on the 1110."
5,In the next three seconds.,"GREAT book. Quick, easy read for or to children but interesting for the reader also. Full of facts, trivia, and lots of ""food for thought""."
3,"A book to read after watching ""Young Victoria""","After watching the movie Young Victoria I felt that I wanted to know more about Queen Victoria, and also the accuracy of the movie. This biography was interesting and reassured me that most of the movie is based on some kind of fact, even if the order of events and some other facts differ. Worth reading, but not the kind of book you can't put down."
4,queen victoria by Lytton Strachey,"I purchased this book at a library sale and it has no copywrit date other then the 1921 date published by Harcourt, Grace & World,Inc and renewed by Jame Strachey, with no renewal date. The copy I have has 434 pages which include an index of subject matter. The only other used books mentioned for sale have a copywrit of 1981 and have 100 less pages. This book is in very good condition and has the original cover jacket. It begins its historic tale in 1817 and includes footnotes at the bottom of the page."
4,Pivotal & Engaging,"Strachey's book was published orginally in 1921 and was a pivotal biography according to Linda Wagner-Martin in ""Telling Women's Lives - The New Biography"". This book broke away from tradition and provided a deeper look at the Queen and all those around her by abandoning the notion of promoting a person's successess and strengths and instead paints the portrait of a human with weaknesses, motivations, strengths, and stuggles. The reader sees the Queen in relationships that become history and see the impact of personality in making decisions.The book is engaging especially once Victoria moves beyond childhood and becomes Queen. The portrait of Edward and Victoria's relationship is vivid. The story provides a rich understanding of places in the lives of the royal family that continue today, namely Balmoral, and give a glimpse at the royal family culture that can be seen in current events. It is more than a book about Queen Victoria.Enjoy!"
4,well documented brings Victoria in a different light,"Brings Queen Victoria into a very different light , shows that shes a woman above all , the book touches the love story of the century gone that was her marriage to Albert"
1,Wasted money,"Please don't waste your money. This product if horrible. This product says 2 bags, it actually means that they're are two bags of product to use in one session. It takes alot of time to use this product. Over 4 hours. You apply the first bag of product and time it, then rinse it, and apply the other bag of henna, time it, and rinse. It claims to cover grey. It only tints it slightly. But you don't read this until you get the product and its in the instructions. Nothing wrong with the seller or their service."
5,Bought for a friend,"I purchased this for a friend. She liked the way it worked, which is great for a natural hair coloring product. I use the chemical stuff, so maybe I'll give this brand a try next time."
2,Do More Research Before Purchasing,"I was excited to see that you could achieve a brown color with a henna product. Or so I thought. The information on the web site doesn't contain important points that would enable you to make an informed decision to purchase this product. There is a very detailed color chart included with the product that is not provided on the web site. This would be the first step in making an informed decision to purchase. The color chart revealed that in fact, this product will not produce light brown results, but a variety of reddish tones.The web site also doesn't explain the lengthy, cumbersome, messy and complicated process involved in actually using the product. Well at least I think it is all those things, because frankly I won't even be trying the product based upon the instructions. It wasn't that expensive so it is not worth it to return it, but I hope that better information is provided in the future to avoid someone else having a disappointing purchase experience."
3,Could have been better...,"First don't even consider this kit unless your prepared to paint! The strongest point is that a vintage police car version option is included. Fit and finish is fair to good, but the flame decals can't be applied to the hood as described in the instructions. I had to modify them to get just an acceptable appearance. More custom parts would have been welcome. The interior dosen't even offer buckets or a custom console with floor shifter. A fair amount of chrome parts are included, aswell as extra wide racing tires. This Lindberg offering is OK, but you'll probably do better with versions by AMT or Revell.Seek them out and compare before you buy this!"
3,The Meister's Approach to Writing -,"The Meister's Aproach to Writing is unique in that it addresses the fundamentals of beginning writing, mostly non-fiction, with a direct, hands-on--I've been there--directness.Meister practices what he preaches, and has attained his stature in the writing world by hard work and a never-give-up attitude.He passes this on to his readers.This book gives a quick overview of for the beginning writer of either fiction or non-fiction. He uses concrete examples from his own experiences, with which readers can indentify.I recommend it for anyone entering the field or those who find themselves in the quadmire of rejections."
1,Useless Product,Tried half of bottle & squeak sound still exist. Guess best way to re-surface disc instead of waste $$$ on this.
2,I DON'T NEED A COPY!!!,"I HEARD CHALREMAINE BEAUTIFUL VOICE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE ""BLACKWOODS"",I LOOKED HER UP AND ORDERED HER CD,,,IT PLAYED IN MY CAR BUT IT WOULDN'T PLAY ON MY COMPUTER AND THAT WAS 3YRS AGO,,I REALLY ONLY LIKED 2 SONGS OFF THAT CD,,""MY SONG"" AND ""OUT IN THE RAIN"",,,OUT IN THE RAIN"" IS ON SINGLE AND U CAN DOWNLOAD IT!! HEY AMAZON,EVERYTHING I GOT FROM U GUYS ARE 100% GOOD,BUT WHEN I ORDER THAT CD FROM U GUYS AND U HAVE 2 GET IT FROM SELLER WHO SAYS IT GOOD 2 GO,,,AMAZOM NEEDS 2 CHECK THAT ORDER B4 IT GETS 2 THE BUYER,,ALL THAT S&H PLUS THE PRICE OF THE ITEM AIN'T NO JOKE,,,I DON'T NEED COPIES,THOUGHT I WAS GETTIN THE REAL THING!!!"
3,"Use Stereo, Not computer !","The music is really fine when played on my stereo, but wouldn't work on my computer."
1,do not purchase - copy controlled CD,"I heard Charlemaine while watching a movie and fell in love with her voice. I then searched everywhere until I found her CD. I paid the full price of $19.99 USD and delivery charges. I could hardly wait to play my new CD.When this CD arrived I found out that this CD WILL NOT PLAY on any of my stereos in my house. I have a CD/mp3/DVD player in every room and the CD WILL NOT PLAY. I could not figure out what was wrong until I went online and found out about copy controlled CDs being a huge problem in the UK. They will not play in a majority of CD players and can even badly damage your drive. The only place this CD would play on is my little walkman CD that I use for working out, and this is not working out music.This CD is not worth your money if you cannot even play it on your stereo equipment. DO NOT PURCHASE!"
5,Best kept secret in music today !,"Just like Jill, I heard Charlemaine during the ending credits of ""Blackwoods"". Great voice, great material, great music, greataudio quality, great addition to any CD collection. 5 'greats' =5 stars."
1,Totally useless book,"Subject material is explained poorly, probably due in part to an inadequate translation from the original German text.The (mostly bland) pictures do not illustrate how camera features were utilized to get the 'ideal' image. Book is missing an index, and the table of contents is dense. Doesn't go beyond anything the manual covers, and obfuscates many points covered in the manual.Poor coverage of camera interaction with SB-26/SB-28 flash units. Example: no discussion of usable metering modes when working with fill flash outdoors. Don't look to the SB-26 or SB-28 books by this author for any help either. An incredibly poor combination of books whose whole is dreadfully less than the sum of its parts.Useless as a reference work, and dubious as a guide. Spend your money on slide film and learn from your own mistakes.Unfortunately, I couldn't give this book less than one star -- it really should have negative 5 stars!"
1,Not only a bad translation!!!,"I am from Switzerland and, of course, bought this guide in german. It is not due to the bad translation into english that the book lacks information, clarity and useful information. It is simply a rather hasty written review of an excellent photoworkhorse that had to be thrown onto the bookmarket as soon as poss. What a pity because the camera is fine!"
2,Not worth the money...,"There is no depth to any of the information with regard to the camera's features. A total disappointment! If you got a manual, you don't need this so called ""guide""."
4,Lantern Guide is good if no manual is available,"The Lantern Guide is good if you can't get your hands on the original Nikon manual. There's probably no need to own both. For a camera as intricate as the N90s, some type of instruction book is a virtual necessity, especially if this is your first autofocus SLR.The Lantern Guide does speak more critically of some of the shortcomings of the matrix metering system but stops short of saying that there are times when you should just pull out an incident light meter if you have one."
2,poor,the magic lanter guides are poor--they should be much better--they should get a better editor and a better tech writor from one of the photo magazines to work with them
1,surprisingly low budget film,"I love period peices but...this film takes on characteristics of a low budget, poorly done film....I am still amused when I think of how bad the acting was in this movie..."
2,How could the BBC produce this?,The Mayor of Casterbridge is an enormous dissapointment. My wife and I have enjoyed more than a dozen BBC dramas on DVD which have distinguished themselves through brilliant acting and quality cinema production. This film is painfully slow and seemingly amateur in execution. We wouldn't recommend it.
4,The best of Zed Yago,"Clearly following in Warlock's footsteps, Zed Yago is a female-fronted heavy metal band from Germany with a penchant for the dramatic. They actually branded their form of music ""dramatic metal"", which essentially means Warlock with more songs about Pirates and Camelot. Singer Jutta Weinhold has a lot of the power and emotion of Doro Pesch, but with less affinity for ballads. If Ronnie James Dio ever wrote an album for Doro, it would probably sound a lot like Zed Yago.SPV's 2002 collection From the Twilight Zone serves as a retrospective of Weinhold's tenure with the band. The 2-disc set includes material from both Zed Yago studio albums (1988's From Over Yonder and 1989's Pilgrimage) as well as previously unreleased live recordings and demos, and a video clip for ""Black Bone Song."" It's more than enough to give you a good idea of what the band was all about, and is probably all the Zed Yago a casual fan will ever need."
5,simply a very nice teapot,"it's biggest attribute - it is 20 ounces.top does not screw on (push on lid with some kind of gasket) pour spout hole does not close so i cover it with a kitchen towel(not air tight), tea basket is nylon and some sort of plastic frame(minus a star), with stainless no odors or left over flavors, any coffee press is super for loose teas.i'de say it is a great design for office and quick drinkers. don't pour too fast or it will leak.will keep your 20 oz hot long enough. it is not made for the long haul on piping hot/leakproof if that iswhat you're looking for.updatei'm giving it a 5 as i use it daily and throw loose tea in the body and use my own straineras it is easier to use than glass..an excellent buy for under 20.00 for me"
5,Excellent Tea Maker,"I love this tea maker, it is easy to use, keeps the tea hot, and is very portable! There are no negatives to using or owning this item."
2,Fast forward???,"Most of the time i will give Engelbert rave reviews for his superior vocal abilities and his unique song interpretations and yet on this one he seems to be in such a hurry that most of the songs are sung in a fast forward tempo until a few of them are unrecognizable. A few songs he only sings one line to the song!!! I know he may be trying to sing as many songs as he could squeeze in for the show but in doing so he blazes past most of them as if he had a plane to catch (maybe he did?). After the loving is sung so fast he barely can squeeze the words into it in time! Unforgettable and When I fall in Love sound almost like totally different songs from the originals! He flies through his old hits as if he's ashamed of them and there's only a few songs that he actually takes the time on to sing and this Cd leaves you wondering, what was the hurry Humperdinck?"
5,A GREAT BOOK BY A GREAT WRITER,I SUBSCRIBE TO THE DAILY NEWS AND LOOK FORWARD TO ARTICLES WRITTEN BY MICHELE MCPHEE. THIS BOOK WAS INTERESTING AND ENJOYABLE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
1,It Sucks,"I thought it sucks big time. First of all James Galione's crew did not know this character named Chris. As some of us see it Marvin and Michael lied. I suggest if anyone wants to write a book, do your homework first. Before writting about someones life. James name should of never been mention in this book."
2,UNIMPRESSED!!!!,"Man, did this book suck!!!!! Nothing personal, but the author's writing style was like something out of US WEEKLY or PEOPLE magazine. Not to mention Chris Paciello's mob contact was very little once he left New York. I don't know, it just wasn't that great of a book. Imagine you just finished reading MURDER MACHINE or BLOOD AND HONOR, and then you pick this one up. BIG LETDOWN!!!!!"
4,Well-written Mob Story,"""Mob Over Miami"" details the rise and fall of one Chris Paciello, who, through a combination of luck, toughness, street-smarts, and charisma, became a major player in South Florida's nightclub scene after he left New York. I hesitate to divulge anything else, for this book is such a great read I wouldn't want to give anything away. I will state, however, that, in my opinion, the author, Michelle McPhee, is without a doubt one of the best true crime writers around today. Once I picked up this book I found it difficult to put down. After you read this story, I think you'll agree."
4,TO LIVE AND DIE IN MIAMI,OLD NEWS: BUT WELL PACKAGED. IT'S AMAZING THE STUFF YOU CAN LEARN IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK.
5,Enchanting in the Morning,"I cannot get enough of the main song, Peace Be With You. It is the perfect choice on an early morning, next to Fairuz, of course!"
3,hmmmm,"Works great most of the year. When it is 50 degrees or less, the water tempurature declines. Through the peak of the winter, it's pretty much a cold shower. Customer service is very pleasant and willing to help. They have sent us 2 replacements (the last one was a larger size)at no extra cost to us, but still having the same problem every winter. We are looking into a larger one again. Our house is 2 bath. I still won't ever go back to a tank."
3,Installation is difficult,We bought this product to replace a 20yr old tanked water heater. We have been working for a week now trying to get a hot shower. We live in Texas so our water temp is okay with this unit but our electric is taking alot of re-do to get it to the point of a pleasing shower temp. I recommend that everyone have the unit professionally installed by an electrician/plumber and then stay on top of the problems before the warranty is expired. Good concept just not so great for DIY.
2,Doesn't work when it gets cold in Florida,"I'm quite happy with this heater, except for 3 months out of the year. I live in Florida Tampa Area and figured this a warm climate, but if the temperature goes below 40 degrees the heater won't work, I have it in a carport shed, so no insulation. If I put a space heater in my shed and let it run for about an hour I'll get some hot water after leaving the faucet running for 5 min. The whole thing is very annoying to say the least.So overall I do not recommend this heater except if you live somewhere where it never gets below 50 degrees."
1,5 failures in 5 years.,"I've now been through 5 different units in slightly more than 5 years! Extremely poor reliability. One heating element failure, three printed circuit board component failures, most distressing! The units just won't last any length of time. I've spent a lot of time trouble shooting,talking to customer service reps and technicians and far too much time and money ripping out old failed units and putting in new ones. I remodeled the space and area when I put in the first one and don't have the space to put back in a tank style heater. It lasted 20+ years!"
3,still much better than american tankless company,"Much better unit than American Tankless company, AH-27 top of the line unit which does not heat water, refuses to answer phone calls, returns certified mail unopened, and sends broken pieces."
1,Watchout on this one.,"5 years in with this heater, and I finally had to replace it. From the start this water heater has had a problem keeping water temperature consistent. It's finally got to the point where we can't put up with it anymore. I went ahead and replaced it with a Stiebel Eltron Tempra 24 Plus, and it seems to be doing fine so far.Thing is this type of heater is supposed to last up to 15 or 20 years, and that's where your savings comes in compared to the cost of a traditional tank heater. I'm not going to get into it too much. Read some of the other reviews, and I've had many of the problems they have had."
1,DO NOT BUY BOSCH PRODUCTS,"We purchased a Powerstar AE 115 Electric Tankless Water Heater, and while it worked fine for 4 years before the heat exchanger started leaking and caused it to short out BOSCH will not honor the 10 year warranty on the exchanger because it was defective. Why?Because instead of using two 40 amp breakers, the electrician used two higher amp fuse to ensure safety. What happened to the good old days when people stood behind their products? Now I am stuck with a worthless unit, and will have to shell out money I don't really have to get another one!! Yes I am bitter about it!! And it will not be replaced with a BOSCH product! Any Suggestions?"
1,A V O I D This is NEXT TO JUNK,REPORTED 60 % FAILURE RATES FOR SMALL HOUSEHOLDS AND COLDER AREAS. MINE DIED JUST SHORT OF 3 YEARS OLD. CRUCIAL PARTS WITH ONLY A 1 YEAR WARRANTY FAIL AND THEN YOU HAVE BOAT ANCHOR LOWES HARDWARE DISAPPOINTED AND APOLOGETIC. MUCH OF THIS PRODUCT IS FROM PORTUGAL AND BOSCH ISN'T STANDING BEHIND THEIR WORK.. B U Y A M E R I CA N and read your WARRANTY.THIS IS A BOAT ANCHOR WAITING TO HAPPEN.
1,Terrible product,"This product should not be sold. We dedicated this unit for one shower and a soaker tub. Showering with it is not pleasurable at all! It is hot then ice cold, then scolding hot, then cycles between luke warm and scolding hot."
1,very disappointed,"I had this unit installed in a one bath, single occupancy home in 8/10. As of 3/11 this unit has a burned out element. When contacting Bosch customer service I was reminded that the warrenty only covers parts. I was instructed to hire an electrician to check it and have that electrician contact Bosch's tech dept to troubleshoot. I would not waste my time nor money having this substandard unit fixed. I've never been happy with it's performance. The water temperature has always fluctuated wildly. I plan to have it replaced with a quality product by a company that stands behind their product."
2,One more case of fail,"My heater failed this week. The professional that came to replace it, confirm many more cases where the same unit failed. According to many people, the American brands are more reliable. I just changed my for a Titan N210. Even when the Bosch AE115 were working, it did not work properly for the winter in South Florida."
1,Bosch does not provide a lasting product,"I had a Bosch Powerstream tankless electric water heater installed when I built our home 5 yrs ago. The heater never did work properly as it would always change temps while using the water. Only for about one minute but long enough to notice while in a shower. Finally, it gave out after five yrs and I called the 800-798-8161 line for assistance. The person I spoke with was very difficult to understand as he was foreign. He also had a terrible attitude and acted as if he was doing me a favor by speaking to me. He was unable to solve the problem and was not able to advise how to proceed. So I threw out the Bosch and bought a hot waster heater at a much lower price than Bosch's tankless ones. I will never by a product of theirs again."
5,The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings,"This is the greatest CD or album in my opinion that has been recorded. When I was a very young boy I heard the first release and when I heard it I was completely enthralled. I am still enthralled. Dolphy is incredible, beyond mere words. Coltrane has a group of musicians that he finds no boundaries with or limitations. Elvin Jones and the bassists are also astonishing. To this day when I hear this music I must stop what I am doing.This should have a million stars."
4,Investigate investment,Hefty snapshot of Trane at his most accessibly raw intersection requires commitment for the bloat to pay off but anyone already registered at Sheets o' Sound university should be up to the task.
2,Too much wheezing and squeeling,"I love jazz, and I love almost all Coltrane, but I'll be honest. I find these shows a bit difficult to listen to. There's just too much wheezing and squeeling here for my ear. I find myself whincing at times. Other times it's not seeming to go anywhere. There's something pathological about Coltrane's playing. He sounds a bit like a dying cat. He must have been heavy into the Heroin by this point."
5,Beauty amidst chaos,"Greensleeves - truly perfect music. Some artists have nothing of value in their entire career, despite selling millions - U2 spring to mind - conversely some CD's are worth buying for just one track, even at this price. The rest is great too."
3,For Advanced Listeners Only!,"As the title of my review indicates this is only for the not so faint of heart. I think you will either like this, or not like it. Not much middle ground. If I wanted to explore the Avant Garde, and had never done so I would not recommend this. I have never understood the fascination with Coltrane's experimental period. There is good jazz in this period, but I think there are much better choices then Coltrane Avant playing on this highly overrated set. These reviews are buy fans of Coltrane. And they should be taken as such. Tread carefully. Borrow this if you can before you decide to buy."
5,Deep in a trance...,"Just listened to the 20 minute long ""Spiritual"".More than I can handle.Eric Dolphy took me over the top.Kinda like that Stevie Wonder song ""Too High"", these guys were stretching it to THE LIMIT,and then stretching it even farther than that.Got tears in my eyes while trying my best to not break down.This music'll do that to you...It's actually very dangerous, to concepts of ""keeping a lid on it"".Then Trane comes back in after McCoy's solo and..oh my God....Maybe THAT's what its like to die and float up into heaven....--SUCH-------A-----------RUSH....Eric Dolphy was an avatar.E.....................verybody raves about Trane,but Trane said DOLPHY was THE ONLY musician that was truly his equal...Boy can you hear that on this set...AMAZING..........................................................."
4,Much to Commend,"This book deals (on a general-public level) with various catastrophes, geologic and otherwise, that have impacted life on earth. There are separate chapters on volcanoes, earthquates, floods, pandemics, mass extinctions, etc. One should bear in mind the author's long standing opposition to the Alvarez hypothesis of meteoric impact as the defining cause of the Cretaceous Mass Extinction. They give only one side of the story. And their objections to the now widely accepted Alvarez Theory have all been satisfactorily answered. Aside from this, however, this is a well worthwhile book. It's later chapters are devoted to human impact on nature, ozone depletion, carbon dioxide build up, and the exponential curves of population growth, energy consumption. ""Ignorance is the essence of the problem that humanity faces..."" is how they phrase the current problem, finally concluding that now is the time to ""Think Globally and Act Globally"". One can only too heartily agree."
4,We all live in Tranverse City,"This is a great Warren disc and a must for any collector. The electronic keyboard dominance in places through me at first, but I quickly came to appreciate it as strongly contributing the whole feel of the album. Available as an import only? A crime. Someone should pick this one up."
3,Run Straight Down,"For a Zevon disc, it's not the best and it's not the worst. Some great moments - Transverse City, Run Straight Down. Some OK - Long Arm Of The Law, They Moved The Moon. The rest somewhere in between."
3,The Future looks bleak...lighten up Warren,"Transverse City captures Warren Zevon at his most pessimistic. From the ""I feel like going on a killing spree"" sentiments of ""Gridlock"" to the ""Hum of desperation"" in the title track Warren paints a pretty bleak picture. Usually he lightens the tone with the occasional humorous piece but even ""Down in the Mall"" has the tone of depression attached to it and ""Splendid Isolation"" sounds like a plea for help. A very electronic and heavy sound mix continues this mood from beginning to end. Thoughtful concepts buried under dark mood music."
3,Data?,"Normally I get annoyed myself when the focus of the review is on something other than the quality of the product. If you had trouble with the vendor that's what feedback is for. But I also get annoyed with vendors who list items for very high prices but provide almost no data.Is this item the MGM collection reviewed elsewhere? If you want someone to pay $175 you might want to let your prospective customers know something about the product. (Subtitles, # of disks, original language, etc.)"
1,Yikes!,"Wow, I stumbled on this while looking for the original Zeros. How did these guys not get sued for stealing the name? This is cheesy faux punk/glam drivel. If these purple dudes are still around, I hope people don't think they are going to see The Zeros (original 1976 punk) & end up seeing this train wreck. I'm thinking this is supposed to be sort of a funny/comedy kind of schtick, based on the lyrics & the fact that they are driving a Chevy Vega on the cover. Doesn't work though. Even when the guitar work is pretty solid on a few songs, the lyrics & singing is painful. Avoid at all costs."
1,Not even 20 pounds,"This magnet would not pick up 20 pounds, much less 30 pounds. Totally disappointed."
4,Great little Pick-up Magnet,"No, this magnet will NOT lift 30lbs. I tried lifting a 10lb. weight with it and it couldn't do that, although I'd bet it could lift 5lbs. But that's not what I bought this magnet for... I bought it to pick-up nuts, screws, bolts, etc. when I drop them (typically in the bottom of my jetski hull) in hard or impossible to reach places. And it works GREAT for that! For my purposes, exactly what I needed."
4,Where is Jah Cure?,"This CD was great. I would have given it 5 stars, but where is Jah Cure? Any compilation CD without Jah Cure is missing something. I could do without Sizzla for one CD, but this one definitely needs Jah Cure."
1,"Mostly Potential, One Hit Song (2 Reggae Golds?)","If you're looking for the Reggae Gold with artists Beenie Man, Capleton, Jah Cure, I Wayne, etc. THIS IS NOT THE REGGAE GOLD 2005 FROM VP RECORDS!These artists all have an interesting sound. The problem is only one of them seems to have what it takes for ""Gold"" - that is Vineyard coming through with ""Stolen Legacy"". Change is good, but this a complete overhaul."
1,BOOOORIIING!!!!,"Another Reggae Gold with nothing but old songs. Every song on the CD is over a year old. Come on VP give us somethig fresh and new. This formula is old, stale and boring. For Reggae fans who like hot, fresh new music I recommend you check out '18 Karat Reggae Gold' it is a lot hotter. Reggae Gold is like stale bread, 18 Karat Reggae Gold is hot fresh bread from the oven."
2,Nothing Much New Here,"The author does a nice job recounting Schmidt's career -- that is to say, his research was good. That being said, there's a temptation when someone writes about his boyhood hero (and the author expresses his admiration for Schmidt in the introduction) to put the subject on a pedestal no matter what, to apologize for perceived problems, or, worse, both. Unfortunately, the author falls victim to both temptations, and the book suffers because of it. The book will serve those who don't know much about Schmidt fairly well. For those who know more about him, you won't learn much that is new. The book also lacks meaningful analysis about Schmidt's career. In summary, I expected more on this subject and from this author, and I was disappointed."
2,Nothing Much New Here,"The danger when someone writes about a childhood hero (which the author admits in his introduction) is that the author can idolize the subject without question, apologize for certain aspects of his baseball life, or worse, both. Kashatus' book is well-researched, but it falls prey to both temptations. The result is a somewhat saccharine effort whose goal is to lionize Schmidt without much critical analysis regarding Schmidt's approach to the game and the fans. If you don't know much about Schmidt, then the book might be helpful, but if you do, you'll be disappointed."
3,the prince and the parper,"The Prince, Edward, and the pauper, Tom Candy, met each other they changed their own everything. But they had something problem, so they wanted to change back themselves. Then the prince met a brave man Mile Hendon, so he helped the prince go to back to palace. But they had some trouble because the soldiers didn't let them into the palace. The pauper said about himself that he was the prince. So, the soldiers think they are crazy. It was too difficult for them. Then ....I like this book better form all reading book. My favorite part is prince and the pauper when they change their own the moment. ""How exciting ""I thought. They can own the totally different life. They both were brave and curious . When they know what were the other life they still can became themselves .People always need some unusually thing to excite their mind. The story gives people who have boring lives a fantasy.The same reason as me like the store, and it has happiness final."
2,a literary stinker!,"The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is the fact that the book is great in the begining (chapters 1-3 out of 34), but gets more boring each second I read it. I would not recommend this bokk to any one, except the people that like old english literature with word like: doth, whither, goest, thou, thy, and many other confusing words."
2,The Prince And The Pauper by Mark Twain is a classic novel.,"Since the prince and the pauper know nothing of each other's life works,the book can be quite funny at times with the boys getting into some hilarious situations.9"
2,"Boring, not worth the read","OK, but not worth the read. It was a bit uninteresting. Lots of old English, but it is well written by superb author."
2,"A typical example of classical literature, not enjoyed by me","The Prince and the Pauper was a classic example of early literature. It was written like every other Mark Twain book, in old English dialect. I could understand it, but at times I had to read some areas over again to get what he was saying. I read this book for a literature assingment, and I did not enjoy it. Some areas of the book are funny and quite charming, but overall the story is really hard to get into. If you like fairy tales or stories from medievil times, this is the book for you. I really think I could have read a book better than this one with my time though. I also recommend: ""Princess: A tale of life under the veil in Saudi Arabia"" By: Jean Sasson"
3,The Prince & The Pauper,"The Prince & The Pauper - the title of this book pretty much explains the plot. The Prince, Edward, Prince of Wales (son of Henry VIII) and The Pauper, Tom Canty of Offal Court meet one day and realizing how much they look alike decide to switch places for a day. If only it were that easy - as circumstances would have it it's not that easy to explain the situation to people, thus it's numerous days before they are reunited again, during which hilarity ensues.It took me awhile to get into this book, which was suprising given that it's only 209 pages. It just didn't blow me away, that being said, I enjoyed the overall story and the life lessons that are subtley hidden through out the pages."
3,The Prince and the Pauper,"In the book ""The Prince and the Pauper"" I loved how descriptive Twain gets. He has so much detail and it just feels like you are there. It was so interesting how he described he described Tom in Edwards clothing. The only thing I really didn't like is when they talked I couldn't really follow what they were saying, but over all I really liked this book."
4,Extremely difficult,This is one of the most difficult books I have ever read. If you can understand it then it's a very good book but also confusing and you may have difficulty following the story line.
5,The Prince and the Pauper,Tis is an awesome book. Mark Twain has yet again created realistic characters and has a great plot. A must read for kids and adults alike!
1,Not such a good book,"I had to read this book for school. It was the worst book I have ever read. It has mostly old English and you have difficulty understanding what is being said. The plot of the story was good, and I enjoyed it. It was hard to read on my own. I won't recommend this book."
1,A Review of the Prince and the Pauper,"The Prince and the Pauper is a not so great.It had its good points but overall it was bad. For exampel when Mark Twain wrote it he wrote it in old english,which made it realistc but somewhat dificult to under stand, and I would not of read it but I was reqired to for a book report.Unless you really like midevil England I dont suggest this book to anyone,but if you want to read a book written by Mark Twain I recomend Tom Sawyer."
1,The Literary Offenses of Mark Twain,"Mark Twain was a great author... but this book is an exception to the rule. This was probably the most boring book I've ever read. Twain just goes on and on about, stupid, pointless, boring things. I do not recomend this book."
1,VERY boring book,"If you like headaches and boredom, read this book. The english is hard to understand, and it is very dull."
5,The Prince and the Pauper,Very good edition with original illustrations replicated. Sent in a timely fashion and arrived in good condition.
2,The Prince and the Pauper,"I would have to say the theme would be that things aren't always as they seem; neither are people. Be loving and kind to all, not just the worthy, but the unworthy too; not just the rich, but the poor also. Try to understand what everyone goes through and look at all perspectives. All have different situations, some more unusal than the next, but no matter the person, we all have struggles.I liked this story. It was interesting and had wonderful descriptions of everything-especially in the royal court. It sounded SO beautiful. On the other hand, some of the dialogue was hard to understand because of the old language. (Lots of ye's and thou's, that sort of stuff) At times, it got a little boring, but in all, it was a good book.written by:kelly spitler, 5th period english due:9/29"
1,these letters should have been kept private,"here we have three great poets. sounds inviting, interesting, wonderful. instead boris writes like an infatuated 14 year old. marina is often hysterical. their ego's are so soft, constant reassurance seems to be the name of the game. a polite letter from a bored rilke has marina and boris delirious with happiness, too excited to sleep, pouring over every 'the' and 'and', looking, searching for 'deeper meaning.' if this book is read as letters by three unknowns, i doubt it would be published. boris is a cad. after one letter stating undying love for marina, he wishes to leave his wife, leave his child, pack his suitcase and live happily ever after with an also married marina. i guess their life partners are expendable when it comes to poetry, or, more like it, the rich and pathetic fantasy world of boris and marina. this is one of the most uninteresting books i have read. my advice - stick to the poetry and avoid these sickly sweet letters."
4,Good mailbox flag,"This is a good quality universal mailbox flag - not ""flimsy"" as another reviewer posted. I bought it to replace the flag from my mailbox after some idiot backed into it. The installation was quite simple although I did have to drill 3 holes to hold the base piece."
2,Cheap price as well as quality,"I'm sure if you live in warm climate, won't matter if replacement flag is metal or plastic. Living in Northeast, plastic won't do. First hit by snowplow pushing 3ft snow/slush will shatter it. Was not aware this flag was plastic (as are all the parts that come with it) until it arrived. The picture is misleading as it looks heavy duty, when in fact it is flimsy plastic, made in China. Luckily I also bought one from Fulton Corp for about same price, which is made in USA and is metal."
3,replacement flag,The kit requires drilling new holes with an included template. I did not have the proper drill bits and drill required for installation.
2,Poor Order Filling,"I ordered the Solar mailbox replacement kit and received the Gibrartor mailbox kit. Careless selection at order filling caused this problem. I used the original parts to replace the mailbox flag and threw the new parts away. Moral of this story is, make sure you get what you order."
2,WARNING! Don't bother with this item! It's a ripoff!,"When the flag on my mailbox started falling off all the time, I bought this flag as a replacement. Once it arrived, I discovered that it requires a machine screw and nut which are NOT included! So, I wasted 20 minutes looking in the hardware aisle at the local department store for the required screw, which they didn't have. Now I have to wait until I can get to a home improvement place for it. Either way, I will have to pay for a WHOLE package of machine screws and a WHOLE package of nuts I will probably never use. How hard is it to include a little screw and nut in the package? Now my mailbox flag has to stay broken for a few more days. What a ripoff!"
1,Ridiculous Rods,"These are the least user friendly product I ever purchased. One end has a little hook, the other end is pointy, and the fasteners are so difficult to use that even my hairdresser couldn't put them in my hair. Don't waste your money."
1,"uncomfortable, hard to use","Hard plastic curlers with pokey ends, don't even think about wearing them to bed. You need a third hand to put the fasteners on. A complete waste of money and time, I couldn't even ship them back because it cost as much as the curlers themselves."
3,One joke comedy of female President and confused hubby.,"This is a one-joke film with Polly Bergen the first woman President of the U.S. and Fred MacMurray a befuddled ""First Gentleman."" Runs out of steam early on. Inexplicable Oscar nom for Costumes - ""What costumes?"" Worth seeing however for Bergen's dramatic scenes as no-nonsense, hard as nails President. She'd have made a good one!"
2,A waste of time,This book reputes itself to tell the secret history of British media baron Mr. Maxwell. A better account and although a work of fiction a more plausible account can be found in Mr. Archers `The fourth of Estate'. Maxwell had connections with Israels Mossad and he did have many high level contacts in Israel and he was involved in dubious behavior with the Russians but this book goes one step to far and simply creates relationships that did not exist. Beyond Muckraking this book is mostly fantasy and conjectured accusations that for the Maxwell hator or for the uninformed may well seem accurate but the truth is far more likely to have nothing to do with Maxwell being murdered by the Mossad. In fact Maxwell simply failed in business and probably committed suicide. This is an interesting account but should be read with an eye of suspicion.
2,Not a scholarly book but somewhat entertaining.,"Authors continue to use material from by ostrovky, an agent who worked for the mossad and then wrote an unking book about them, inorder to portray the mossad. Including one of his most lurid claims about how This is a very slanted view. Shows 0 scholoraship. It includes some of the more fantastic claimes by ostrovksy.If I was interested in ostrovsky view, which is that of a traitor to the mossad, then I could read ostrovsky, but to continue to use ostrvosky material here to describe the mossad is ludicrous.This includes Ostrovsky statement that everyone in the mossad uses sex to advance. Aside from this I wonder how the author got all the info about how the mossad operated with Maxwell, including the details of meetings etc.. How can they know this information, without making up stuff. At no point do I get the feeling of scholarship in this work. This is somewhat of a pot boiler. You might enjoy this work of fiction or (non fiction) any way."
1,boring!,"What a poor read about a fascinating man. One can like Robert Maxwell or dislike him, but no one has ever accused him of being boring. How have these authors managed that?I couldn't get myself to finish the book but read far enough to notice appalling inaccuracies and multiple fantasies. As an Israeli I have read many interviews with people mentioned by the authors as their sources. The authors' quotes do not fit with what these people have been saying about Mr. Maxwellfor years. And very conveniently so many controversial quotes are from those who are already dead, and not here to comment. But to go to such lengths and still create such a BORING book --what a shame."
4,we like it,the cd its good. it doesnt have a lot of songs. only a few but they are good songs. wished it was longer.
4,CD itself was fine. Supplier was not.,"I'll start off by saying the CD itself was everything I expected it to be. A few original pieces from the movie as well as some Elvis tracks and other licensed songs. As far as that goes, I wasn't disappointed in the CD. I was disappointed in the supplier. It was used, but the supplier (goHastings) marked it ""very good."" When it arrived, in a timely manner, I was sad to discover it was far from good condition. The jewel case was stained, scratched, and dirty. The booklet for the CD and even the top of the CD were in the same condition. It's like the CD had been left in a garage unattended for a several years before the important side of the CD got a buff and was shipped out.In any case, I shouldn't let the poor marketing of Amazon's used sellers affect the rating of the product too much. If you like the songs from the movie, you'll probably like the CD. I just hope your supplier doesn't lie to you about its condition."
5,This is great.,My kids love this cd. We do not skip any of the tracts. I'm excitied that there is something different from Disney.
3,Most of it was great!,"This CD was great except for the A-teens song. It sounded really scratchy. I'm not familiar with this group, so maybe that's their style, but it was not up to the quality of the rest of the CD."
3,well.....it ain't the best movie but great soundtrack,ok well this movie is not a disney movie! Disney movies are for kids and there not supposed to be that violent! but disney had to give some for ALL THE STUPID PREEPIE TEENAGERS WOULD LOVE FOREVER AND EVER!! LALA!!! wrong! to tell ya the truth i really hated it! i only bought it on dvd cause i enjoyed it but really it was the worst disney movie to me!! i have a stitch doll cause stitch is cute but he ain't no Mickey or Piglet!! dude there are way better movies out there but hey the soundtrack is awesome amazingly! elvis is pretty cool and i luv em! and the A-teens song is nice nice very very nice! i like the other stuff to but the movie isn't as good as the soundtrack! oh well! poor disney i'll miss ya!
5,The Soundtrack That Will Take You On A Ride,"I really liked this CD and how they have all the Hawaii stuff in it. I thought that was very cool. Adults will like this too if they like(d) Elvis Presly, some of his songs are in here, some preformed by him, some preformed by others."
1,rhdh,"The filter did not fit my car. The listing showed it was the correctfilter...I'm not sure why, because it was the wrong one formy Audi A4."
1,Expensive and caused strange issue,"Once I installed this filter into my Audi A4 there was no noticeable difference in power and, for some reason, the tachometer started jumping around erratically -- small jumps, but enough to feel jerks in the car while cruising at about 30MPH. Because I had not done anything else to the car other than install this filter I decided to try a different filter, which I bought from Autozone -- the problem stopped. Strange problem that I can't figure out, but why try to figure it out? Don't get this filter and instead go to your local auto parts store and don't even think about it."
3,Great Toy...for older children,"Well I got this for my two year old who loves to watch his daddy use his tape measure, hoping this would also deter him from trying to play with it as well. Great Idea for a toy but he doesn't really play with it. My husband, brother and anyone else who is older than two has found this toy more fascinating each time they play with. All i can say is that it's a stress reliever for me. On the upside it's practically indestructible."
1,waste of money,"Our child loves to play with a real tape measure so we were sure he would love this one. Wrong. He was excited when he saw the package but was very disappointed when he got it open. It would not pull back into the unit once the tape was pulled out. Our opinion: frustrating, useless, waste of money and time."
3,OK...but not worth the shipping cost,This is an OK toy...But they charge you more for shipping than they do for the toy....so I would not recommend it...
3,Big Tape Measure,"This is a very durable product, although it was a little bigger than I thought it would be. The tape is hard to pull out and the wind up is difficult for my 3 year old to manage by himself."
2,Hard to crank,"The tape measure is big and bulky. The tape pulls out easily, but is very difficult to wind back in, even for an adult"
2,"good toy, hard to wind-up","I bought this for me 3 year old, who loves to play with our tape measure. He was very interested in it initially, but has a lot of trouble winding it back up and so lost interest."
3,Clunky and Large,"Bought this for my daughter as she loves to use our real one. This toy is large and clunky. If you ask me it's poorly designed for a toddler as it's huge. It's also hard to wind back up. My daughter seems to like it, but I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Love it!,This tape measure is just what my son needed. He has stress tested our real tape measures and they failed! This one is made very well. The tape is only 3ft long which my 3yr old wishes was longer. But I guess for safety reasons this is a good idea. He does not find it difficult to wind up like some have mentioned but I have a very determined child! Would definately buy again.
2,could be better,"I thought the tape measure would have been longer. A little hard for my 2 year old to turn. She is not enamored by it, still would prefer Daddy's real tape measure."
2,Not so good quality,"Love the idea, but the quality isn't all that great. The tape measure is very choppy reeling out and even more so reeling back in. Would not recommend."
4,Good overall toy,"I bought this toy for my 2 year old son, who loves to do manual labor. I hope you enjoy it much"
5,tape measure,great delivery time and the kids enjoy the tape measures.Thank you very much.My son had these when he was young and wore it out.They still make them after 20 years
3,Loud and clunky,"It's loud when you wind it back up and because of its bulky size my son can't do it by himself, they should have made it half the size, and more realistic. Not a long lasting toy."
4,Girls love it too,"Most of the reviews are from parents of boys, but I bought this for my 2 year old girl for Christmas. She and my 6 year old girl love playing with it. It seems durable and easy to use. My 6 year old likes to use it as a dog collar/leash for her stuffed dogs, too."
3,Not easy to use for little hands,"This item constantly gets stuck, the tape is easy to pull out but VERY Hard to wind up. My girls got very frustrated with this and now they don't play with it often :("
1,tape measure,"It's neat in theory but the tape is hard to pull out for a kid, even harder to wind back up. It's just not really made for a smaller child, maybe more like seven or eight year olds?"
1,grandmother,"Children aren't real good with their hands. This toy is VERY difficult for me to wind up much less my 3 year old grandchildren. Since it is awkward, it doesn't catch or keep children's attention very long. Could be a really good toy if it weren't so awkward. I've had much better. I would highly discourage this purchase for anyone."
2,"Really Fun, While it lasted...less than a week.",I bought this for my 4 1/2 yr old for Christmas. It is easy and fun to use and I loved that it is educational and does not require batteries.My son played with for less than a week before the tape part completely ripped out.I would save your money.
2,Nice idea but difficult for little hands to operate,"My 2 girls love to measure (ags 2, 4) I purchased 2 so there would not be any fighting. It does not retract, the way ""real"" tape measures do and the handle is hard to turn for them. Skip it."
2,Not made very well..,"My twins love helping daddy around the house so I thought this would be the perfect toy for them to play with so dad can have his real measuring tape back. The concept is great but the measuring tape is a mess, it is hard to pull out, gets tangled up and is hard to ""wind"" back up. I would not recommend this product- the kids are back to wanting daddy's real measuring tape."
4,Pretend and Play Tape measure,"This gift was purchased as an ""extra"" something for my four year old grandson at Christmas. At first he was not so excited about it and thanked me politely. Since Christmas when I go to visit I have seen him measure his sisters height the length of tables and anything that interests him. It is not something he plays with all the time but he does enjoy it. It is a good tool for learning."
3,Not great!,"I got this toy for my 2 year old because he always wants to play with the real tape measure. The idea of this is great, but the mechanism to wind it is a little tight and is not easy to use. My son gave it a few tries and gave up! We are giving up too and sending it back!"
3,ok,it was ok. didn't look like i expected but good for a small boy who needs fillers under christmas tree
4,Fun for my son,This tape measure has been fun for my son. He loves to go around and measure things. It does seem sturdy enough to last. He has been rough with it and it still works.
3,hard to rewind,"This is a fun toy for my grandson and he loves hearing the clicking noise when he pulls the tape out. However, he is 18 mo. old and can't rewind the tape because it's too hard to do. He pulls it out and hands it to me to rewind."
2,hard to use,This tape was a little sticky and hard for the 2 and 4 year old to use. Its cute and doesn't damage the floor but is not the best item purchased.
5,Beautiful Book,"Great for any art lover, reader, or even as a Christmas decoration. Beautiful book with well chosen paintings. Bought this as a gift for my mom, (a librarian) who loved it. Really recommend."
3,"It's okay, but...","...Shouldn't something from the MMA be a bit better than okay? I was hoping for something that would make a good holiday hostess gift, but even spiked eggnog can't put the sparkle into this book. There's nothing special about this book ... it's almost as if it were printed to be a top-quality remainder"
5,Classic Disco at its Best,I am so glad that this Russian import CDs are available because I am not able to play any of my old vinyl anymore for obvious reasons. The sound quality of this Russian import is superior and I love hearing these classic songs while driving in my car.
2,A confusing book,"I agree with everyone else here. I'm in a class at UCLA with this book and if I had relied on this book I wouldn't be learning much Spanish. Why is this a ""best seller?"" I learned much more from Barron's ""Spanish The Easy Way."""
3,Decent travel guide,"If you're planning your first trip to London, then you'll want a travel book with more detailed information than this one. If you've been to London before and just need a crutch to fall back on accompanied by some good maps then this book may be for you. It's a small guide and will easily fit in a jeans back pocket or jacket pocket. The maps in the front and back covers are pretty good. It gives a page or two to all the major must-see places in London and is a easy read. Most likely though, you will want to check out the Rick Steves' guides which are updated every year."
4,Nice little compact guides,"About 1/2 the size of a regular Lonely Planet book and just a hair bigger than the Top 10 guides. Packed with lots of photos, maps, information and perfect for the on the go traveler like myself. I have been to 8 countries so far. I have an extensive personal library of Travel books, guides and maps and Lonely planet is my second favorite bested only by the DK eyewitness guides which tend to be twice the price.These guides are well worth the money and if you can get a good price on a good quality used one, it will more than pay for itself."
5,Old Spice Smell Nice,This spray smells nice and manly - it seems that the smell sticks better to hair and clothes than on skin. I happened to like the older version of old spice Aual reef better because that smell would stay on my clothes even after washing
1,Not red ZONE,"that's a lie, the picture show REDZONE, but when i brought it, it just same old spice. i will never bay from you again.keep the truth in your products."
1,Stick to classical polyphony,"Stick to traditional Wester classical music. That is where the knowledge is. On the contrary, the idea is to rescue this heritage, which may be slipping, as shown by the lack of polyphonic composition in our time."
2,Shall we Dance,"This was recommended to me by a friend who is interested in"" Pasadena Light Orchestra"" kind of music but it doesnt really fit the bill, its quite good but nothing outstanding and you have to get it from the USA. If you.ve had a few drinks it sounds better but then doesnt everything."
3,Good acting but too long.,"The message of the movie was good, but it was too drawn out! I had wine an hour after the movie had started , then I had dinner, then I had dessert and still, the movie was far from over.Recordar es vivir, ¿pero toda una tarde, con un personaje no muy agradecido de la vida''? No gracias. Necesitaba a Freud el viejo, más que escribir un libro.Los detalles de las decadas vividas en la Argentina es lo que es más interesante de la pelicula.NEXT!"
5,Oh yeah and I think I'll have one of those Pina Colada BANG,"I have some great memories of this band seeing them perform live all over the Los Angeles area and although this CD contains a differen't bass player then their first CD it doesn't hurt the music at all. The songs are all fast, fun, melodic with very catchy hooks. The CD only contains 8 songs and they seem to just fly by so it's not a full length CD but it is very cool and for any Howard Stern fans out there it has the song H.O.W.A.R.D. which was Horard's theme song in his earlier days."
5,you're not threadsafe,"you can't just synchronize everything... and that's the point of this book. synchronizing is critical but most of us do it incorrectly without a thorough understanding of the jvm. this book has given me some useful concurrency patterns which are sufficient for good programming practice. the part of the book you need to retain is the 'what' to do, the rest of the 'why' to do it is useful but not critical to improve your code."
5,Very good reading for more advanced developers,"Concurrency is hard. If you plan to write high performant, easy to understand code, or at least understand other concurrent codes in Java, you should definitelly care about this book.I don't recommend this book for not very experienced programmers however. You should have at least some knowledge about concurrency, ideally from computer science related studies (or books).If you are Java developer and looking for other alternative, don't look anymore. Read this."
5,Concurrency In Practice,Excellent and timeless work that everyone should read if you are writing Java applications because all apps are now running on multi-processor systems due to progress in Dual/Quad core chip technologies.
5,Excellent explanation of a complex subject.,"The book explains in detail the issues of concurrency. Although a complex topic, the explanations are crystal clear. Well worth reading by anyone writing explicit multithreaded code, or implicit multithreaded code such as anything in a J2EE app server."
5,Authoritative on the subject,"This is ""the"" authoritative book on java concurrency. However, apart from some java specific items, the book is an excellent source on parallelism in general. Do not even try to implement parallelism without ""reading and understanding"" this book. Highly recommended !!!"
5,Must read for any Java developer,"It is extremely good book. Might be hard at times, but more because topic itself is kinda complex. Book is really well written."
4,Simple clear advice on concurrency,"Don't think I can add much to the review of this title, it is simply one of thebest and clearest books on concurrency usage in Java applications."
3,"Good for beginners, but a drag otherwise","I am surprised to find the majority of the reviewers rated this book 5. I find that this book is loaded with noise and you will have to wade through the authors excessive obsession to state the obvious over and over again, even in its ""advanced topics"" section. Such as:""Performance is a moving target; yesterday's benchmark showing that X is faster than Y may already be out of date today.""Also, some of its examples uses non-standard annotations - @ThreadSafe, @GuardedBy, @NotTheadSafe, etc - that the authors hoped will be part of the JavaSE 7.0 release. (NOTE that this book was written when Java 6 was in beta stage)"
2,Do not pay for it,"I received it as a gift for purchasing an Invicta watch, as a gift it is OK. I do not think it is worth $45.00. You can get same quality for $ 5.00"
3,Another Umbrella - Nothing unique,I recieved this as a free item with their watch. $45 is not i would pay otherwise may be $7-10 at the local shop. Makes it feel like good deal when they add $45 value to a $119 watch.I would say just make your decision based on the watch not Free Umbrella.
3,can't beat the price,"if you got this for free with a watch, it's a great deal. if you paid $45, well, you have a big, sturdy , yellow umbrella with the invicta logo all over it. if you don't like it, it would make a good gift for someone who doesnt mind a little product placement. it's not cheap-looking, and the shaped handle with ergonomic grip is a nice touch. i just wouldn't have paid $45 for it on its own. it's nice to have a big umbrella, though, all my other ones are super-cheap mini-compact ones. i'm hoping this stands up to the wind as well as keeps the rain off me. time will tell."
3,Great as a promo!,"I received two of these free, as an Amazon promo when buying Invicta watches. Nice large and sturdy. For free it was a great deal! However, it is not worth $45. One of the reviewers said it was worth about $5 and I disagree with that completely. Another said it could be found for right at $20. At $20 it is a very good deal. But again, I would not pay $45 as is is just not worth it. So, wait until another promo or get it for $20."
2,It's an umbrella,"What can I say? It's an umbrella. It's great for free, but I wouldn't actually pay money for it."
2,Free Advertising,"It works, but why pay $45 to give free advertising to a sub-standard watch company who gets all their parts from the lowest bidders?? BL"
4,It's a close call ...,"Yes, I'd agree this live show is better then the ""Redwoods"" that's also still available. The band is tighter musically then the Redwoods concert and did a great job. That's not to say the other is bad ... but I'd much prefer this show. Now, I can't say it's 'better' than the ""Kenny Loggins - Alive' DVD simply because I LOVED Kenny's rockers on 'Alive', which was just 'smokin' hot!' BUT of course we are getting a bit older too and we're talking about a '20 year' spread of time. haha! The Grand Canyon concert is a good buy, tight band, and great percussion."
5,Kenny Loggins-Live from the Grand Canyon,This is a special DVD to have. It's done in a close setting with one of the greatest views in the world as a back drop.
3,not to pleased,When I looked at the product it said oem replacement for original tilt trim switch the instructions say to remove original switch from handle and replace with this unit.The holes in handle will not line up so there is no way to use it as described.I will find another way to use it since I have no other choice would be nice if the description was different .
2,Pretty Pictures of Indians and Their Horses,"There is very little in this book about the healing power of horses.Donna Carlow, the one Lakota who overcame a horse riding injury, recovered with the support of the Lakota community; because they value horses in their culture more than Anglos. At least that is Wendy Baker's take on Donna's healing. She doesn't attribute it to the horses; she attributes Donna's healing to the Lakota culture and the Lakota community.The book concentrates on 9 Lakota Indians and 3 Lakota families and their stories about the importance of the horse in Lakota culture.It's by no means a comprehensive book; it's primarily a picture book with stories. And it isn't about the healing power of horses in the Lakota culture.Many people believe that there is a real spiritual and a healing connection between horses and humans, but this book is not a source for that information."
2,Very superficial and uninspiring.,"There is a lot of potential in this subject, but the author didn't begin to do it justice. The people she met/interviewed are dealt with very superficially and she doesn't spend much time discussing her own recovery.There just isn't any substance to this book."
4,Still sound good...Dylan Lite!,"The Byrds made Dylan listenable for the masses (in the 60s). Even today these songs still sound good in my opinion. I have the Dylan originals, but if you want to understand what he is actually saying/singing, try the Byrds. They are like ""Dylan Lite""."
4,4.2 Best of the Solos,"This is the best of the 4. Great songs, good sound and pretty heavy (as far as Kiss goes) at times. Tonight You Belong To Me rules! One of my favorite Kiss songs ever! (even though its not a Kiss song). Goodbye, Wouldnt you Like..., Its Alright, Together as one... are high quality songs. Just really cool and have stood the test of time. Even sounds fresh today. Of course you get the typical ballad (Hold me, touch me), but it is a great cd and the best of the solos. And yes, that includes Aces...In fact this cd was much, much better than Pauls 2006 outing as well."
4,the best of the solo efforts,"Of all the 4 solo albums under the kiss flag, Paul's is the best by far. This album is a great testament to paul's song writing skills. From hard rock ( wouldnt you like to know me) to ballads (hold me touch me) to pop sounds like (move on). This album is the ground work for all the kiss albums to follow. A must have kiss album! Buy this album you wont be sorry"
5,Great!,"I'm a huge KISS fan, but this is some of Paul's best work..Same goes for Ace's solo, they are both 5 stars, a must have for KISS fans, and highly recommended for Classic rock fans!"
4,Paul Stanley - The King of Croon.,Paul Stanley does what he does best here and makes the ladies swoon with his romantic ballads and Pop rockin' love songs. It's a pretty solid album overall but it could have used a little more of an edge to spice it up a bit more.
3,"Paul Stanley Solo, just Paul Stanley solo.","Well, many KISS fans will be angry with me, but for me, his solo album is not the best of the solos, too many regular Kiss composed, it is the most KISS style from the solos, but not enough for me to be the best, I preffer Gene and Ace solo albums, but it is very good, a great hard rock piece."
5,Best of The solo albums,I feel that Paul created the best of the 4 solo albums. His musical genius really shows. This album is similiar but different from the Kiss albums. You can really tell how much influence Paul had on the Kiss sound.
4,Great solo job all around.,His music and lyrics were fantastic and it is well worth owning because he sounds great.
4,Stanley Solo,"Paul Stanley is truly the voice of KISS and his debut solo record is pure Paul at his best. Although the record did not sell as many copies as Ace's, Paul's solo is definitely the record that sounds the most like KISS.The 9 songs are very melodic, beginning with the build up track 1, "" Tonite You Belong To Me"" and ending in ""Goodbye"" .Rumour has it that the entire record was inspired by a one nite interlude with a woman Stanley met on tour.Any die hard KISS fan should have this in their collection."
5,Paul Rocks,"Pauls solo album is for sure the best of the four.he is the heart and soul of kiss and the best writer, by far.Ace's was good to though."
3,"If you are a Paul Stanley fan, then buy this album.","I love Paul's voice and every one of his songs are excellent. But this solo release was a little disappointing to me. It just did not have that Kiss quality. I guess it shouldn't sound like Kiss if it was a solo effort. ""Moving On"" and ""It's Alright"" and the best songs off this release. But if you are truly a Paul fan, then you need to have this in your KISS collection. Ace Frehley's solo album was by far the best of the 4 members."
2,Second best of the solos.,"Paul Stanley proved he could write songs with this album. What makes this album listenable is Paul's voice. He is the best singer in the band. The music is well done as well. Apparently, unlike Gene, Paul took this venture seriously. Not as heavy as Ace's effort and about a billion times better than Peter's. Then again, what album isn't better than Peter's?"
2,"Not The Best, But OK","This is an okay album. The only thing is, almost all of the songs are forgettable and don't leave any impression. They just sound on the whole like filler. The only song I like to listen to is ""Hold Me, Touch Me."" That's a very impressive, moving song with a nice touch of a guitar solo. I actually give this album 2.5 stars. Not the best music, but okay."
4,EVERY KISS FAN SHOULD OWN THIS ALBUMN,"THIS ALBUMN RECENTLY BECAME AVAILABLE AGAIN ; I HAD TO WAIT SEVERAL MONTHS,AND DIDN'T WANT TO PAY $60 FOR THE IMPORT VERSION. I FEEL THAT PAUL'S SONGS HAVEA CERTAIN TIMELESS QUALITY TO THEM , AND THIS CD HAS HAD MANY PLAYS IN MY TRUCK.THIS ALBUMN HAS LOTS OF GREAT SONGS, AND IF YOU ARE A KISS FAN , YOU SHOULD OWN THISONE ( THE ACE FREHLEY SOLO ALBUMN IS A MUST, TOO.) CATCHY , HOOKY, WITH A COUPLE OF BALLADSTHROWN IN FOR GOOD MEASURE. PAUL STANLEY NEVER FAILS TO IMPRESS ME WITH HIS VOCALPROWESS AND GREAT SONG WRITING.THIS ONE'S A KEEEPER !"
4,A Must Have,"Paul Stanley proves why Kiss would never be Kiss without him. It seems that to pick a least favorite song from Paul Stanley one would have to resort to flipping a coin. Everything that he does has enough merit to warrant a listen.This release covers it a all. Stanley delivers: a ballad, acoustic guitar, blazing rock, mellow type jazz; it's all here.As always, the vocal performance is top notch. When he belts out ""Tonight You Belong To Me,"" you believe it.Simply put, here is the best voice in Rock, ever, and this is his first solo effort. How can't it be good?"
5,More Great Tunes,"Paul Stanley knows how to write a rock-n-roll melody. He very rarely misses. His solo effort proves this point moreso than his KISS records. There just aren't any *bad* songs here. The thundering rock of ""Tonight You Belong To Me,"" the radio-friendly ""Wouldn't You Like To Know Me,"" the power ballad ""Hold Me, Touch Me"" these are simply tuneful and energetic songs.Without question, Paul Stanley is a 'rock star.' It's what he does. He didn't experiment too much with this record, didn't reveal any hidden talents (although ""Together As One"" is a much more interesting song than typical power ballad fare) he just wrote some great songs, probably some of the best of his career.This album and these songs totally hold up to the test of time. Had they been on a KISS record they might be the staples of the catalogue they deserve to be.Paul Stanley is KISS's songwriter. And on his solo album, that's what he did."
3,A Second Place Finish For Paul......,"I actually would give this 3 1/2 stars if the rating existed, but it doesn't. Paul cranks out some great tunes and rocks harder than any other of the solo releases except for Ace's.It's easy to see from this solo release why most of Kiss's most melodic tunes have been penned by Paul. Unlike Peter & Gene's albums, you'll find yourself playing this album more than once.""Tonight You Belong To Me"", ""Take Me Away"" & ""Goodbye"" are great songs. I would have loved for Kiss to do them on an album(aka Gene's ""See You In Your Dreams""), giving Ace a chance to put his stamp on them. If your debating this one over price, pick one up used on zShops....it deserves a listen by any real Kiss fan."
3,Is this Paul,As a kid I thought this lp was a masterpiece.It brought you into the world of Paul Stanly.He was that romantic superhero he portrayed.BUT to listen to him talk in later years about how the lp was simply junk to get to the chicks.Well my opinion changed bigtime.If this was truly Paul I would say good album.If it was all pretend-then I would say it's nothin but pure bad crap.
1,The real side of Paul?,"In this album, Stanley gives up any attempt to rock and goes for his eral side: poppish mediocrity at its worst, ballads all around, empty lyrics that seems offensive to an intelligent person. My God, I can't believe it was a KISS guy who wrote that piece of sh...!!So, no wonder KISS went into thing like SHANDI and I WAS MADE FOR LOVING YOU...And some reviewrs said this is better than ACE's solo album!! You must be kidding!!!!"
3,The 2nd Best Solo Album,Good...but too lovey dovey. This has great songs on it but it also has really bad ones. U Should still get it though.it really is worth 10 bucks or less though.best 2 songs: tonight you belong to me & love in chainsworst 2 songs: together as one & goodbye
4,1/2 of Kiss on one record.,"We know the true meaning of Kiss was Paul and Gene, and when Ace contributedd it rocked as well. But Paul Stanley's efforts have always been aimed more for the anthems (i.e.; ""Detroit Rock City""). And what shows more on this release is Paul's ability to not only write the standard Kiss classic, but also distribute radio-friendly hits of the 70's.Dated? No! Peter Criss is more dated as an effort, Paul Stanley's first solo album is actually heard on later releases (""Reason To Live"" is a good example"").If you decide that this is the best of all 4 solo albums by Kiss, then you obviously enjoy ""Detroit Rock City"" over, say, ""Christine Sixteen"" or ""Shout It Out Loud"". But overall, respect the fact that Paul is one major part of the Kiss legacy and remained true to his roots from as early as the '74 release all the way up to ""Psycho Circus"" and hopefully beyond."
5,This ones a keeper,"This is the first rock album I got and it's amazing how some of the songs still stand out over twenty years. Raw and sexy, that's the best way to put it. I know it's been said, but the two best are Paul and Ace. They really went out and put together two great albums and made the best use of the production quality. ""Tonight You Belong to Me"", ""Move On"", and ""Love in Chains"" are my favorites here. After listening, it is quite obvious who a major part of the Kiss sound comes. Everyone tends to underestimate Paul as a musician. Which is easy because he just as in-your-face as a showman as Gene is and cannot compete with Ace as a lead guitarist. But just think on how many musical transitions Kiss has been through (Rock, Metal, Disco, Pop even Rap!)and whose voice and rythym you have heard succeed on all fronts."
1,Flaky blue,"When I received this vase, the finish seemed strange--sort of oily or sticky. I put it in a dishpan with warm soapy water. Guess what--the blue finish flaked right off the vase! I now have a clear vase with a couple of blue flakes sticking to it! Interesting."
2,almost good,"The pictures looks way better than the actual item. If the glass were as clear as in the picture this item would be great. I haven't tried washing it as the other reviews said, so I didn't get flaking but it looks to cheap to display. The only decent part of it was the size. Maybe if I washed off the blue it wouldn't look so cheap and I could just dress it up with long flowers or something.I guess in a wedding situation, dressed up and in low lighting or put LED lights inside it would have a better effect for one night."
1,Rubbish,"Absolute rubbish. I can't understand the positive reviews and multiple stars. This book had no story line and no ending. I feel sorry for the tree that was cut down to make this waste of time. What's worse, I actually ordered this book from a store and am unable to return it. It will definitely be sold at my next garage sale.The main character has no depth whatsoever and the plot goes no where painfully slowly. The idea of creating a suit to withstand the end of the world actually had potential, but tragically this novel does not work."
4,Good Read,"This book was written as a follow up to a short story published inAngel Dust Apocalypse. I purchased it a few months ago and kept putting it aside, I found it in my bookcase last week and am so glad with my choice. Another off-beat page turner by Johnson. A little more sci-fi than I was expecting, but I give extra props to his sense of humor with the book's post-apocolyptic setting. Overall a fun short read for someone looking for something different!"
4,Apocalypse II,"If you're looking for a quick tasty treat, go for this. I figured that armageddon would be sad, but I forgot how funny it would be. Plus, politicians get what they deserve."
5,Post-apocalyptic weirdness,"You like it surreal ? Dark ? Post-apocalyptic ? Creative ? And funny on top ? You will love Extinction Journals. I read the entire book in like 3 days and I took my time. A very entertaining read. A wild, wild story of survival. Read it !"
4,Nice collection of songs,Jimmy Cliff is another great artist and performer whose songs are somewhat philosophical as Bob Marley. I love this CD and have qutie a number of his CDs in my collection. I definitely will recommend this CD to anyone who likes this guy's music.
2,missing many portions of sketches,"Having bought this as a part of the box set of Personal Best disks because I saw that it listed a particular sketch I wanted, I was very disappointed to find out that there are only small portions of many of the sketches.For example, every disk in its intro, references the Argument Clinic sketch, BUT, the sketch is never shown! There are a few seconds of the lead in to the sketch but not the argument itself!"
3,"Ugh, another stupid ""Greatest Hits""","With all the Flying Circus episodes, albums, films, books ect. Why is it a must to realese another best of. As a huge pythoon fan, I don't really think there should be any. Nobody new should get this, and certainly not anyody who has been a fan for a long time. How bout instead of more best of compilations, maybe a realese of more solo stuff like Rutland Weekend Television, Bonzo music videos from DNAYS, At Last the 1948 show episodes, which there are more of than on the DVD's. There's also Out of the Trees, the unrealesed outtakes album, or maybe someone can find filmed but unused material from Flying Circus. But of course, when I went on amazon.com today, there's was The Monty POython Box Set. Don't get excited. It's Holy Grail, ANFSCD, and a Terry Gilliam movie Baron Machunakeiujb, whatever it's called.Who cares and who the hell are buying these best of DVDs."
5,Rachel Ray skillet pan,I am very pleased with my Rachel Ray skillet pan. It is light weight and therefore easy on the wrist and hand. The ceramic finish on the bottom and sides of the pan facilitate cleaning and the maintenance of its appearance.Vigorous scrubbing is no longer necessary. Food is sauteed evenly and quickly. I would not hesitate to recommend this item or to purchase another in the series.
1,I'm still stuck,"I have purchased several guides for painting houses in the ""home improvements"" category. They were fine for learning about painting a house, but I'm hiring painter, so I don't really need that information. What I need is help choosing the right color. Obviously I don't want to make a mistake. I already know that I want a yellow house. But none of the colors I have tested look right. They are all too bright or dark even though they look pale on the paint chips. When I saw this book, I noticed the phrase ""choosing paint colors"" right in the title, so I assumed it was the answer. But, I felt every bit as stuck at the paint store as I did before reading the book. My expectation was that I wouldn't have to start going through paint chips anymore, but the information in the book wasn't specific enough to be useful to me. The book did not meet my expectations."
4,The Art of Exterior Painting,"Painting a house or even thinking about it is no fun. I visited a Benjamin Moore Paint Store and browsed through the store's only copy of the book, The Art of Exterior Painting. The book is very well written with the basics of house painting described in detail and with color photos describing problems, solutions and ultimate results. The book impressed me so much I went home and ordered it via Amazon for my own reference as I plan to paint my house. An excellent PRIMER!"
2,Not accurate for the north,"This book is good for the southern half of the lower penninsula, but it is lacking in the Northern half from what I have found. I too have discovered that it shows roads where there are none, doesn't show roads that are there, and quite frequently (probably 30%) has the wrong road name. Don't venture into Norther Michigan and depend on this map or you'll end up in the middle of a National forest lost with out a reliable map to get you out. However, it is usually accurate in regards to highways and most main county roads."
1,Not very accurate,"Although the books detail looks impressive, when you get onto the small back roads, where you really need detailed information, the maps too many times are not reliable and not accurate. They show roads where none exist, roads that do exist are not on the map, road names are often wrong, and all sorts of other innaccuracies."
4,Good for Dry skin,I like this cleanser cause it doesn't dry my skin out and puts moisture into my skin.
1,Greasy!!,This product is going in the trash. It is almost like a cold cream and doesn't even wash off a water based mascara. Partway through the day my face became so greasy it was affecting my vision - a greasy film transferring from my face to my eyes. Yuck!!
1,not clean enough,"I was reading the reviews and noticed that most are actually for a different neutrogena product. The extra gentle cleanser is very gentle, but it doesn't clean very well, I use it before swimming and noticed, after leaving the pool, that i still had big mascara stains under my eyes. I am still looking for a good cleanser for dry/sensitive skin that foams and that I can use with water. This is not the one."
5,Best Cleanser I Have Found,"I would not have liked this product when my skin was very oily. But now that I am older my skin is oily in some places, dry in others. This product does a good job of cleaning and removing makeup, and leaves my skin slightly moisturized. I have been using it for years. It has gotten hard to find in stores. Glad Amazon has it so I don't have to look all over town."
2,Not as Good as I thought it would be.,I thought this products was going to do well But this product did not get all of my make up off and it doesn't moisturize my skin. My skin gets really dry after washing my face and I was hoping this product would help but it really didn't. I feel as though I've wasted money on this product. I will not purchase this item again.
5,Gentle yet thorough,"I love this cleanser. It cleans without drying my face, but doesn't leave a residue feeling. I've been using it for almost 3 years."
4,Reminds me of Clinique,"For me, this product doesn't work for removing makeup (I use Bare Minerals and Waterproof Mascara). However, I like to use this product after washing first with a scrubbing foaming cleanser which removes my makeup but often leaves my skin dry. The Neutrogena Extra Gentle will then make my face less stiff and dry and provides a better base for applying makeup. (Dry skin and makeup are not a good combination!)"
5,Great product for teenagers,This product is often hard to find in local pharmacies. My two teenager daughters love washing with this each night as it is not harsh on their faces and works very well for acne.
4,Good,It feels very gentle when I use it. But my face do not feel as clean as I used to feel with other facial cleanser. Overall good.
1,Don't buy this product - It fails!,"I bought this charger for my Pantech PN-215. I am most disappointed. It charged my phone twice andthen quit working. Just sparks in the electrical wall socket, the green light refuses to go on and nothing willcharge. Don't buy this product. I am very disappointed because I paid the higher cost for this item thinking I was buying a good product. Now, I have to find another vender and in the meantime, I have no working cell phone! This was a waste of $16 by the time I paid postage. Beware."
2,Sometimes you wonder,"Novelists should be daunted by moments when a character describes his feelings. Shepherd, however, has the worst debriefing habit I've ever seen. Characters often discuss a scene that has just passed before readers' eyes, gambling that what the character says will align with what the reader feels. In this novel, people often say how much they were moved. What happens, however, if the reader wasn't, or, worse, if the scene before left the reader flat? In Shepherd's novel, we are supposed to believe in Henry's transformation. Through righting a list of wrongs, Henry ""The Assassin"" Chase is supposed to rediscover the idealist he once was. It's a fun premise, but for me the ""supposed to"" was its most vivid element. I never reacted as Shepherd thought I should, and who moves a reader by proffering he or she ought to react?"
1,It's Craptacular Sentimental Pap!,"I finished this book, threw it across the room and yelled a swear.It's drivel based soley on melodrama that really goes no where. No hurtle is crossed, nothing is lost, and nothing is really at risk. The guy is a jerk, he decides not to be a jerk (a big step) and goes about doing it. In the process of not being a jerk, he's a jerk. Everyone forgives him with almost no resentment or question, and we are supposed to be moved by this? Bugger off!"
3,Good leading to Average,"The good part of this novel is the plot premise. The idea that someone's life can be changed from a single moment in time to something completely different. Unfortunately instead of exploring something interesting the author John Scott Shepherd randomly shifts views every 15 or 20 pages into something different. While I think this can be effective it is overused by Mr. Shepherd to create a book that becomes almost sterile. The book to me has very fake emotions and becomes almost contrived; you may not know what comes next, but you definitely know that something unexpected is coming. A previous reviewer for Amazon stated it perfectly that this reads like a movie script. However withstanding all of this the book is an Average light read with a good premise, which can be enjoyable sometimes."
5,Stayed up late to finish this good read,This book had enough twists and turns to make it fun and interesting. Henry and Sophie are memorable characters in a fun and funny read.
4,The Assassin? Maybe,"A truly enjoyable story about a guy who's a ruthless, self-absorbed jerk. In a moment of blind panic, Henry Chase realizes that he's done a lot of damage in the past ten years while he tried to make his life something he can flaunt in the face of his high school love. But Henry realizes it's gotten him nowhere. Sophie, a would-be psychologist and part time hotel maid, urges Henry to make a list of the bad things he's done and do his best to correct them.I enjoyed Sophie quite a bit, although she got pretty weird toward the end. Unfortunately for Henry, little revealed in the book shows him as The Assassin, except for his past exploits. I wish there'd been a little more Assassin in Henry throughout the present portion of the book, just for comparison. Besides, he's kind of a spineless wimp, it seems. But, it's a good read otherwise, and the way it is written keeps the reader entertained."
4,good book,"Shepherd's first book was a very good book and a fast read. He keeps you interested with interesting twists and turns and a surprising end. I've read it could become a movie and the plot would make for an interesting movie also. The book shows you the ways that some wealthy people use others underthem to get to where they want to be, at the top. I suggest you read this book."
4,Sophie redeems the book as well as its hero,"It would be easy to dismiss this book as slick and facile. As others have noted, the plot feels a bit too much like a screenplay, with each madcap complication conveniently, smoothly, and often unconvincingly resolved. However, the relationship between Henry and Sophie is wonderful. The dialog in their scenes together saves the book. It's dead on, witty, sometimes laugh out loud funny, and sometimes very affecting. Sophie saves not only Henry, but the book."
5,List of Wrongs is just Right,"Henry's List of Wrongs is an amazing book! It keeps you in suspense until the very end. You can't go ""wrong"" by reading it. It's a great premise that you can go back and fix wrongs that you have done to other people. John Scott Shepherd is one of those authors that will be on the New York Time's best seller list for years to come."
5,Perfect for the Toy Story Fan!,"My two-year-old is absolutely in love with Jessie and Woody so this was the perfect Christmas gift for her. The dolls came just as I expected, though there were a few stains on their faces that I was able to remove with a Magic Eraser. My only complaints are that the hats don't stay on very well and when Jessie and Woody talk (by pulling on the string) it's really quiet. Other than that, these are the perfect gift for a Toy Story fan."
1,Most deceptive film ever made,"Don't bother.Basically none of the scenes from the trailer are in the film in any greater length than that of in the trailer. In other words if you wanted to see more of the awesome redhead your out of luck, or thing topless big breasted woman shaking them by the rocks, or the girl carrying the melons then you're out of luck.Don't waste your time or money like I did, I took one for the team, so heed my warning.I paid the $7.99 to own this and it's a waste, I can't figure out how to download it (I think you can only do that if you have a kindle). So I got screwed by amazon and by the misleading trailer of this film."
1,Stay away,"Stay away from this movie, this movie is not worth the rental, let along buy it, run, run, run, low quality"
3,It is what it is.,"It is what it is. So so video for those expecting total nonsense.A great way to turn your brain into something resembeling and feeling like pudding.From time to time a rational person needs to turn his mind into mush, and this will do it.NOT politically correct. Sure to outrage the feminists."
4,A promising police mystery,"Cat Austen and Lieutenant Victor Cardenas try to solve the case of a murdered DJ. And it seems the sooner the better because Cat is the next victim. But with the size of her protective family, whom I enjoyed getting to know, I'd say the odds are stacked against the murderer.Ms. Rubino has some well-written, full-bodied, realistic characters. The subject matter of this particular title is touchy or maybe I should say taboo. But Ms. Rubino seems to have handled it tactfully."
5,Remember the Titans Soundtrack has all the good oldies,"This is a great sing-along CD especially right after you've won some sort of game. Ain't No Mountain High Enough is an awesome song,but there are also other good hits such as Up Around the Bend by CCR and Na Na Na Na Kiss him Good-bye. This CD is a lot of fun and makes you remember some of the funnier scenes from the movie."
5,Great music!!!,"Remember the Titans has great oldies!!! I am just a kid, but it is still one of the best C.D.s. Even my mom likes it!! This C.D. is worth what ever you pay for it!!"
1,Remember The Titans,It was not the product I ordered (Remember The Titans CD Soundtrack). The outside cover was Remember the Titans but inside was a lullaby CD. It was a used CD for $4.99.....I thought that was a dirty trick. The seller's name was Fred Smith... No contact information. Extremely disappointing.
5,By far the greatest soundtrack and movie ever.,"I would recomend this cd to anyone. It still brings tears to my eyes. Rember the titans was such a realistic movie about comming together and putting racial differences aside and beecoming friends and becoming ""perfect"" in every way as a team."
3,I'll wait,"The movie was probably the best of the year. The music fit the film perfectly however I do not want a song compilation. Like ""Armegeddon"" and ""For the Love of the Game"", I will wait for the score to be released."
3,Left out good songs,"I just got home from the movie and there were some songs I heard that I was really hoping would be on the soundtrack. But no. It was a great movie, and it IS a great soundtrack but it is such a let down when these movie people include songs in the movie but not the soundtrack. So 3 is my final choice."
2,Could have been better,Don't get me wrong. This is a fine soundtrack. But ANY 60s compilation CD would suffice. Given the rich orchestral themes which were played at length throughout the film it is a pitty that a film score wasn't released in addition to the soundtrack with the 60s songs (as was done for For the Love of the Game).
2,Disappointment,"I have to agree with the fan from australia, this cd should have been released with a sister original score. I had the same disappointment with Phenomenon. Trevor Rabin is such a wonderful composer and I would have jumped at the chance to hear his complete score. The one track is great, but not sufficient. I have refused to buy this cd for that reason. I would recommend that any other score fans stay clear if you feel as I do. Not to be too sarcastic, but other than that, the cd was great."
4,Good Collection,Bought this CD for a friend. He was pleased with the songs on it. It was a really good collection of 80s Country Love songs.
2,be aware of the 3 volume set,"Overall, I love the Cambridge histories of literature. Unfortunately, this one, on Amazon, was a little misleading. Be aware that there is a 3 volume set for Latin American Literature! When I ordered this, they sent me Volume 3, which only covers Brazil. I sent it back and ordered from the publisher. Apparently the 3 volume set is difficult to find!"
2,Barely interesting,"The stories told in this book are somewhat interesting and well written, but they are all basically the same. The book seems to go in no particular direction. It contains interviews with various stripppers, but it leaves alot of questions unanswered."
1,"Not so good, if you need fast...","I ordered two of these packs on the same day, same order. I needed 1 day shipping, they are double billing me on them. Amazon is charging shipping on both packs of these, even though they are being sent from the same location.If you don't need it right away, don't worry about it. But, if you need in a day or two... Be prepared to pay double the cost."
1,Not Worth it,"My daughter suffers from MAS and I was thrilled to FINALLY find a book that discusses the syndrome. However,I found that it really didn't tell me anything more than I already knew as an educated MAS parent. It seems to be nothing more than a cookie cutter book molded to whichever disease is being covered. A parent with an MAS child would most likely have already uncovered most of the info that this book offers long before they read it. Word of advise- visit www.magicfoundation.org and become a member- that will prove to be your most valuable resource."
3,Tonight: Das Beste Von Peter Hofmann,"Very good songs, very good singers but the hoose of the songs is not so good - it is too level-toned. The booklet is very brief, the names of other singers are not presented."
4,Nostalgic.,"This series brings me back memories of my childhood, an epoch that is gone and will never come back, sigh... sigh...."
3,The Saucer Hunters,"This is an odd video release. One excellent episode and one dreadful episode. First the bad one, ""Confetti Check A-OK"". This is a rare episode without a UFO in it! This one's a real stinkeroo! Now let's talk about the good one, ""Sub-Smash"". This is a submarine drama akin to the recent blockbuster movie U-571. The saucer-hunters learn the aliens now have a craft that can fly AND function as a submarine. Commander Straker assembles the best possible sub crew to search for it but are ambushed and the crippled sub sinks to the bottom. Can SHADO raise the sub to the surface before the crew's air is depleted?"
3,"Some great, some OK. Recommended.","A good effort. I bought this CD for the Rejected Commercial Jingles, specifically Necco Wafers, Twister, and Pillsbury Cookie Dough. Those 3 jingles made it a worthwhile purchase.If you like this CD or even just parts of it, try a Da Vinci's Notebook CD. Paul and Storm were part of Da Vinci's Notebook before the band took a hiatus."
5,Absolutely essential,"If you love movies, this CD is for you! I have listened to it all at least a hundred times, and I'm still not tired of it. I'm a big movie buff, so this collection is perfect for me! It contains most of the important cult movie songs that we all know and love, along with some extra tracks that are pretty sweet. So, instead of buying twenty different soundtracks with songs I didn't really want to hear, I got almost all of the songs I wanted in one collection. There's current stuff and older stuff. It has something for everyone!"
4,Cool gypsy jazz with fizz,"This is fast becoming my favorite new CD. I recommend it to everyone. Its not in the mainstream, just off a notch but that's the magic. If you have heard the soundtrack from Chocolate and thought cool music then you need to own this one."
3,Queen Esther-Greatest Adventures of the Bible,"It does not take any religious affiliation to appreciate this reasonably factual tale on the life of Esther, a courageous young Jewish teenage woman who became Queen of Medio-Persia. You are led through the Esther Story with make-believe teen characters Margo and Derrick. This movie and all of the videos in the Greatest Adventure Series are consistently a part of my family time with my pre-school grandson to my teen daughter. 'Esther' is a wonderful teaching tool that particularly demonstrates; decision making skills, community responsibility, and consequences to unethical behavior. Along with his Heroes, Esther has given my grandson another Sheroe. If viewed without adult supervision this 30 minute movie will better serve eight year olds plus."
5,Survey's of the PLSS,A great little compendium for surveyors in the Public Lands Survey System. Keep it handy to look up facts and procedures. Easier than carrying the BLM manual.
5,D@#&....!!!! THIS THING IS AWESOME!!!,"I was on a dilemma, to buy 2 floor speakers and a receiver, or this little beast. I went for the little beast....... OH my god!!! this thing is amazing!!! the bass is just insane!! clear mids and highs turn music into a whole new experience. It is very simple to use and unexpected cheap for all these power and quality. Do you want to drive your family/friends/roommate crazy? this is the tool for that. I highly recommended!!!"
2,Road to Nowhere,"I like car books, I like road books. I've read Kerouac, Least Moon, Obert, etc., and I agree that the premise of the book seems interesting. The book just is not. The author is too focused on biographical details and an adolescent self-satisfaction of driving around in a then-fashionable Porsche. I couldn't even finish the book."
3,no matter where you go there you are,"I remember reading this book and thinking how interesting it would be; but I found his comments a bit grating after a while. I'm sure it was a terrific trip, but I feel this might have been more judiciously edited."
5,Love the music and real animal footage,"My 18-month old daughter has been watching this video since she was about 10-months old. She loves the animals and we love watching it with her. After Sesame Street, a much loved show, this video offers refreshingly real footage (virtually no animation and no puppets) combined with classical music. While one reviewer complained that the Baby Genius videos are not exciting enough, we welcome these videos for precisely that reason. The only time our daughter watches videos is when it's time to calm down for bed or when she isn't feeling well. The Baby Genius videos can be very educational, but only with the help of a parent. We consider that a positive, and have enjoyed watching this video as a family."
4,Great value with the DVD,"I think that the key to this video is the age of the child, I really enjoyed it and love the music. However it did not fully engage my son (10 months), who loves the Einstein products. I really feel that this is a grow into tape. On the other hand I think that very young babies will benefit from the music. I put it on when he plays and name the animals when he looks over to the screen. He listens to great music and I have a visual to watch that I enjoy as well. I think that for children who love the pace of the Einstein videos might think that this is slow.I also use this for wind down time before a nap or during a bottle. I found the the Einstein products are very stimulating and not good to lead into quiet time.The DVD also includes Baby Genius Animal Adventures so it makes for great dollar value. Overall a good product, good value, but it is a product to watch with your child."
1,Not very entertaining,My 23 month old grew up watching the Baby Einstein series and she is constantly requesting to watch them over and over. I tried to put the San Diego Zoo on for her a few times now and several seconds into it she asks for the other dvds. I asked her if she liked this one and she says no....and she knows when she likes something and doesn't. I'm hoping as she gets older she will want to see the animals in this DVD. She knows what most of the animals are but she is not entertained by the music and I think they focus too long on each animal. They needed to move quicker threw the animals to hold her attention.
3,"Good, but not great","I was expecting a spiral bound book. Need to make a revised version with better type, layout, and graphics. Otherwise, the content is good and definitely usable for the classroom."
3,One Great Song,I finally picked this one up after years of debating over whether to give it a try. I am one of the many fans who really enjoyed their early rock n' roll. I love all their stuff up through the Big Beat album. When they went dance music or disco I lost interest. This album reminds me a lot of their more recent stuff like Lil' Beethoven through the present. Endlessly repeating lyrics and music.There is one gem however that makes the album worthwhile for me and that is The ghost of Liberace. The melody is wonderful so a little repetition holds up well on this song unlike the others.
3,just ok,Don't know for sure yet if it really is working! Shipper is great an package came as expected. Crossing my fingers!
5,Red Spiders Suffer Ingest(ing) Lover Blood,"I have an obsession with this band. My captivation leaves me manically speechless and dumbfounded for at least 2 and a half days after catching a live performance. During the last experience I had, the smaller room was so warm with fuzzy goodness, I farted midway through the set, and despite it's rancidness, it went unnoticed. The record is deadly, particularly when in comparison with anything contemporary, yet still does the band no justice to their live performance. If you do not buy this album, you are missing out on some angst filled peace loving hate music with a cheerful kind of sorrow to it.P.S- When you go to the music store and see the album, take all 6 or 7 copies of the CD and spread it across the whole row, almost as a display."
5,MAGICAL,"I had heard an advanced copy of this before and was blown away. I have seen these guys play in a few different cities, and let me tell you it was AMAAAAAZING. The drummer.. I think his name is Isaac, is INSANE. They are very talented and every song on the record is good. It is definitly an instant classic. MMMMMM its also pretty [inexpensive], but even if it were 20 dollars it would be worth every penny."
2,"ok, their next album will hopefully be better.",i liked estrogen. that's a cool rock song. most of the other songs are ok. not much that makes me want to buy a ticket to see these guys. i have my fingers crossed.
5,Music to get you moving...,"This band has great fast energy and it makes you want to dance, you just can't sit still...Great songs and music, a must for anyone who likes German industrial/metal music."
3,"I can't bash this band cuz this is good music, but.........","I hate to down other reviewers reviews but i got 2 of Megaherz's albums 4 or so months ago and i was very dissapointed. I was hearing good rumors so i foolishly chose to listen and act upon them. I gotta admit though, they aren't bad, there are a couple of songs on Himmelfahrt and Kopfschuss (the 2 albums i bought) have their own original sound to them.I must admit though, I'm a sucker for German industrial metal. To me it's all great, but that's just me. Anyway these guys are fine if you wanna have a great tune of German industirial here and there. i wouldn't recomend it to the rammstien fans though, just because it sounds like these guy are trying to mimic rammstien.It suprized me how much some rammstien fans praise this band though, so its really up for debate. ..."
5,A very good read,"Anna Curren has recounted a fascinating piece of history in the story of two women struggling against the stultifying mores of the day.One must admire the convictions of those stalwart ladies who persued their deepest feelings and personal principles regardless of the cost.Its fun, as one reads, to envision which actresses will be vying for these roles when the movie is inevitably made.Well written and absorbing."
5,Best Hitting Guide in Baseball,"I have 30+ years of experience as a player and coach.youth ball, high school and college experience.This is the best way for a young player to learn to make contact and use the entire field.Makes an weak hitter competitve, a good hitter an all-star"
5,Science of Hitting,"Great book for baseball players young and old. It stresses the importance of knowing the strike zone and the benifits of getting a good pitch to hit. Helps you develop the approach of being ""select"" but still ""aggressive"" at the plate, especially early in the count when you can look for your pitch, rather than ""guess"" at what's coming."
5,Fantastic teaching tool!!!,"Several years ago I coached a team of youth all-stars. We were two tournaments away from the world series when we lost in a championship game. If I would have had this book then, there is no doubt in my mind that we would have gone to the series and won it. If you are in a similiar situation get this book before you get eliminated and regret to tell about how if you would have had this book you would have won the series.Incredible book. A must, must have. I'm looking forward to reaching the series now."
5,A Tremendous Book On Baseball!!!,"This book gives you the basics on hitting and teaches you everything you need to know about it. The best part is, is that it was written by Ted Williams, one of the greatest hitters of all time. So then you know it's by a great baseball player and not just some guy you,ve never heard of."
4,"Good Perspective, But .....","Teddy Ballgame put a great read together in this book. Long on player observations, and his playing thoughts, short on actual instruction.Get this book to enjoy the yesteryear of baseball. Get the Mike Schmidt/Rob Ellis Youth Version Study book for much better step by step analysis for the young player."
4,Youth and Baseball,This has some very good tips for the young guys who love baseball. I got this for my grandson who was always looking to improve his game.
5,The Bible of hitting a baseball,"Truly one of the greatest baseball players of all time, Ted Williams, has outlined his techniques and philosophy of batting. Ted dives into the intracate details of the science of hitting a baseball. There are plenty of diagrams that help to understand his concepts. This book is a must for the serious player and the beginner alike"
4,Ted Williams Baseball,Its a pretty good book going into the details of the science of what he believes to be a great baseball swing.
4,"A simple solution, nothing fancy but these work fine.","I bought these for travel and to cover unused outlets throughout the house. We have a 10 month old and so far she has not been able to remove them. I'm not using them for outlets we use regularly, so I'm not sure how easily they come out with frequent use; but I have have used them in hotels and been able to pop then right out when we leave."
5,Actually work,"The plugs actually work, I have purchased many other products only to have the baby immediately crawl over and pull them out (often more quickly than I am able to remove them). They are more difficult for me to remove than other brands, as many of the other reviews have stated. This is a trade off though since most Items of child proofing that are easy for me to open or undo are usually also easy for the baby to undo or learn to undo. So in this case I do not view the difficulty in removing them as a negative for this product. I highly recommend this product, as I have a drawer full of others to compare with."
1,My 13 month old can pull these out,"I was excited to find these for such a low price compared to other brands. However, my 13 month old can pull these out the socket without a problem. The other brands are a little more expensive. I even have a difficult time trying to pull them out the socket. However Mommy's helper are easy to pull out."
4,"Proven Fact, Outlets and Babies Don't Mix","Do you have outlets? Do you have a baby or babies? Do you have babies that want to touch outlets? If you answered yes to the first question, along with yes to either one of the other two, or even worse both, then this product is probably for you. These do what they say, they keep your babies out of your outlets, and that is generally a good thing."
4,they work,"cheapy looking but they work fine, havent had a problem in a couple of months we've had them. the baby has no interest in the outlets."
3,"Decent info, but could have been much better.","This DVD was geared mostly towards explaining voodoo as a religion. It takes you too a village in West Africa and shows some voodoo rituals and tells how the locals think of it. It then gives an historical account of a slave rebellion in Haiti and how tradition correlates the uprisings success to voodoo magic. The last major thing it covers is a brief history of Marie Laveau of New Orleans.In all it had some interesting facts and suggestions. I found it to be a little TOO pro-voodoo, as it didn't discuss much of the negative aspects of the religion. There was another voodoo history channel I saw on TV that was considerably more engageing than this one. However, this was worth watching and lends another perspective."
2,Can do better,"The film is basic, we do not learn new things. I was more happy by watching another film ""Voodoo, the origins""."
3,the original versions,"at last,a cd collection of the late robert palmer,including his original versions,I buy the very best of and adictions vo. 1 but this albums have new remixes of classic songs of palmer,I recomend this album if you want the original songs."
5,It's love,Loved his voice and the videos were some of my favorites.Can listen to him sing all day. Love watching him on YouTube also.He won't be forgotten.
4,A Very Promising Start,"It isn't good to sound like another band, but there's nothing wrong with reminding you of another band. Gregor Samsa could remind you of any of the bands mentioned above, without sounding like they've stolen their sound. This ep rewards repeated listenings. Like GYBE, or Mogwai, the songs build from slow and melodic into crescendos; the sonic equivalent of a calm sea giving way to crashing waves. I had the pleasure of seeing them open for Interpol in December 2002 and I was very impressed. If you like any of the bands that they've been compared to, this ep is well worth checking out. Cool packaging, too."
1,zzzz...snore.....,"The last track is the only track on this CD that I can listen to without getting irritated. You'd think that slow tracks with an ambient-quality to them, no matter how mediocre, would at the very least lull you sleep you. Nope. This CD lacks originality and vision and Gregor Samsa need to disband stop distributing their crap to the poor unsuspecting world. The one star in this review is for the super sweet design of their CD and witty band name. When all you've got going for you in a cool band name and nice album design however, grrrrr....."
4,Deep and Magic,"The first time that I listened the Album was difficult to recognize that was The Church...But when I heard ""BUSINESS WOMAN"" I could realized that it really was! . It took me just a few minutes to discover the magic of the album, specially on songs like ""LOVEBLIND"" and ""MY PROBLEM"". Is different than previous albums? Yes, It is.. but is really good and I recommend it!"
5,Excellent and Eclectic Church!,"The Britney and Aguilera fan from Berkeley obviously knows not good, well crafted music. Once again, just as Priest=Aura surprised us with uncharted beats and melodies, 'Sometime Anywhere' continues down this path with more psychedelia, mediterranean, and trip hop twists. As a whole, it works well, and the listener is rewarded with some clockwork compositions. The Church really know how to write great songs. They are masters."
2,Mix Feelings,"Chase again unleashed another fast-moving story of blackmail coupled with intrigue feelings and extortion with an illuminating and hard-boiled climax. It's the case of three different personalities who combined a force together and all out for the same thing and prepared to face the urge with a zeal of getting their objective at all cost, Assuming when a wealthy middle-aged woman, an international lawyer and a young American, comes together all aiming for the same purpose, the stakes are absolutely the principle thing. The scene is brutal, the weapons are metal and the instructions are leathery.briefly it a story about Judge Henry Cecil Leon who was born in Norwood Green Rectory near London in 1902. he later told wrote books for Alibi for a Judge."
5,Sleeping Beauty,This is a very good soundtrack! It is one of my very favorites! You feel like you are right in the movie while listening to this.Lady and the Tramp soundtrack is also very good.
2,Lame version of the single!,"I was so disappointed when I saw this video, and heard the recently released version of ""Your Disco Needs You."" Instead of UNrecommending this item, I am ordering you not to buy it! If you're looking for the song ""Giving You Up,"" there are better copies to look for."
2,Not as great as I thought it would be...,"I bought this book after it had been hyped up in ""The Sondheim Review"", a magazine for Sondheim junkies like myself. I read it in hopes of going behind the genius of such musicals as ""Follies"", ""Company"" and ""West Side Story"", but instead got a dark and detailed (too detailed for my taste) account of the more dreary parts of his life. There is some musical theater critique, but her lack of knowledge in this area is unbelievable. Her constant ""Here, let me tell you what I think was going on at this point"" grows tiresome as well. Still, there's no denying his life has been fascinating, and this book serves as a good rainy day reader."
1,"derivative, banal, plodding, unauthoritative","The prospective purchaser of ""Stephen Sondheim: A Life"" is likely to be misled by this remark: ""people seem to be missing the point--this isn't a critical biography, but a personal one"". In fact, until she undertook to write it, the author of this book had no personal or professional relationship with its subject whatsoever. It is a thing anyone sufficiently motivated could throw together, and I can't in good conscience recommend it. I can and do recommend Craig Zadan's ""Sondheim & Company"", and for those interested in musical theatre in general, Richard Rodgers's ""Musical Stages"" and Alan Jay Lerner's ""The Street Where I Live""."
2,"Oh, All Right","This was worth reading for the insights Sondheim provided into his work and for the numerous interviews conducted in its writing, but I wish someone would tell Ms. Secrest that the numerous analogies she draws between Mr. Sondheim's life and classical literature are both pretentious and overdone. What's the point you're trying to make Meryle? I'm sure it's not how well read you happen to be. And one other thing: being a homosexual does NOT mean that everything you produce artistically is colored by your sexuality. Couldn't she think of any thing else to say that was relevant? I guess not, but this book is worth reading for die-hard Sondheim fans."
1,don't bother,"It's very sad to see Craig Zadan's ""Sondheim & Company"" out of print and in its stead this plodding pastiche. Ms. Secrest has no training in, experience with, or especial knowledge of theatre or music, yet she feels obliged to bore us with her theatrical obiter dicta, to critique each of Sondheim's works. Ms. Secrest has no training in, experience with, or especial knowledge of pschology, yet she feels obliged to psychoanalyze her subject. The result is not enlightening.recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
4,A must-read for Sondheim voyeurs and fans of theatre.,"A lot of the information is new. There has not before been so personal a view of Sondheim's life. I did find the need to reference the other books to get an absolutely clear picture of Sondheim's professional merits, but this book's motivation was to stress the personal.Now and then there were lacunae in the text which were daunting, considering that they were coming from such an experienced author and such a prestigious publishing house. But it was a fast read. As fast as a house on fire."
2,Her sweet imbecilities tumbled so rapidly onto my lap.,"As a Sondheim addict, my hopes for this new biography were high. Unfortunately, they weren't met -- not even close. As has been stated in other reviews, there is little new here, very little insight; Seacrest does talk to a number of interesting people from Sondheim's past, but the passages she chooses to use are ho-hum at best. Perhaps most off-putting is Seacrest's almost unbearably dry writing style. The fact that she could take a subject like Stephen Sondheim and make him boring to read about has to be one of the new wonders of the world."
2,A big disappointment,This new biography of Stephen Sondheim doesn't tell us all that much about the man. I also found the discussion of his work fairly simplistic. The author often relies on other sources and reviews rather than stating her own opinions about Sondheim's compositions. I often got the impression that the writer hadn't even seen his shows on stage. The more interesting parts are about his growing up period and his recent romantic life. Perhaps this will appeal more to those who know nothing of his contributions to the musical theater.
3,Good cast/mediocre movie,"With Kirk and Michael Douglas leading the cast in a movie, it should have turned out much better than it did. They star as two of three generations of highly unlikeable men who are self-centered, self-indulgent and critical of everyone else. The best scenes do occur between father and son, but there are not enough of them to raise the level of this movie to more than just average. Their long-suffering wives are played byBernadette Peters and Kirk's real ex-wife, and are the only likeable ones in the picture. It's too bad that the Douglas talents are not used to better advantage, but they are limited by a weak script that cannot be propped up by acting talent. Better luck next time!"
1,Very Disappointing,"This film was listed as a light-hearted comedy, however, there was absolutely NOTHING funny in this entire film. It is about a totally dysfunctional family -- two of the family members die, the son is a drug addict -- I just did not see any humor in this film at all. Actually, I found it to be totally depressing! I certainly would not want someone who is already feeling down to see this movie, it might just send them over the edge."
3,A good one for the holidays....,"A lot of critics seemed to be pretty cruel to IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY and I'm not sure I can really figure out why. Then again, I'm not sure why so many critics were as polite as they were to A BEAUTIFUL MIND either. Sure, the film is packed full of melodramatic excess but somehow the characters manage to make the audience actually care what happens to them.While the film may not be all that memorable it is fun while it lasts. Kirk Douglas gives an amazing performance even as he struggles with his speech. Michael's son, Cameron, who has the whole hip idiot thing down, also impressed me. All in all, the film is definitely worth a watch around the holidays. It's just that type of movie that reminds you that everyone's family is a little off sometimes but in the end family is family.C"
1,Boring and shallow,There is nothing funny and entertaining about this movie. It is about three generations of a dysfunctional family. Kirk Douglas is extremely unlikable and Michael Douglas is no more appealing. The movie drags on and on about family problems that are purely depressing.
1,Not worth seeing,This is the worst Micheal Douglas Movie I saw so far. It is about a dysfunctional Famliy. it has little comedy in it un like others that have dysfunctional families. it is downright boring.
2,It Shows Its Age.,"I enjoy hardboiled fiction. Always have. But this book, although its wartime California setting is interesting, definitely creaks with age. I sympathize with the put upon bride (second time with the same heel) but I don't want to spend a whole book with her. Or her bridegroom. Then, too, no body bothered with even minimal line editing so the typos and very odd space breaks are off-putting."
2,Bamboozled,The story line is weak and rambling; the ending no surprise. This was a big disappointment as Dorothy Hughes is overall an awesome writer and a forerunner of mystery/detective stories with strong characters. Not bad for a beach read but not one of my favorites.
3,for driving purposes only,"i wasn't really paying much attention to the album title when i bought this. i just say ""dr. octogon"" and bought it. after months of looking i had found the album! then i put it in my car stereo and... well, it was all beats. it was a little shocking, but it turned out to be a good soundtrack for driving in olympia. nothing i could concentrate on for long, but good background music. i am waiting to hear this in a commercial..."
2,To simular,"hes got two albums out. WAY TO SIMULAR.. buy one and forget the other, Pretty much the same songs.waste of money"
1,it failed immediately,The quality of the thomas the tank engine trains was simply terrible. We bought this in conjunction with my sister and the train transformer failed with in 20 minutes. My 6 year old nephew was really disappointed and getting it replaced was more trouble than it was worth
4,Good Addition,"My Grandsons like long trains so I bought several ""Thomas"" cars to go with the HO scale starter set I purchased for Christmas. The only problem I have with this item is the problem I have with the set--it is difficult to uncouple the cars. I devised a tool from some flat aluminum stock to insert under the couplers which I can use to un-couple the cars; however, my 5-year-old Grandsons find it difficult to use. They find it frustrating, but they haven't broken one yet. I guess that's good."
4,A Real Flag Waver,"A stirring, patriotic and yet perhaps little known story of a Civil War battle. I found it too mature for younger than 7-year olds, but with some background information it could be read to them effectively. The 2nd graders I read to were very interested but puzzled when they found the battle had been lost. They cheered up to see the actual photo of the hero and to hear the war was eventually won. Third to sixth graders will enjoy reading it for themselves and may be encouraged to seek out more Civil War history."
1,"The box looks nice, but the game won't run due to copy protection...","Just a heads up to anyone planning to pick up this game. Due to the copy protection, this game won't run on some computers.If you have any type of CD/DVD burning software installed that's more advanced than the basic stuff that comes with the computer / drive, the game wants you to uninstall it.If you have any type of virutal CD software installed, yup, you guessed it... The game wants you to uninstall it.As far as I'm concerned, when a game company expects their customers to remove software from their computer just to play a game, I'll look elsewhere. I use my computer for games and work, therefore burning software and vitrual CD software is a lot more important than a game that's broken out of the box."
2,NFS most disappointing AI,"The game can be quite enjoyable to play, but extremely aggravating when 20 second lead times are erased because you're not allowed to win by that big of a margin. If you outsmart or out drive the computers cars you will see them granted acceleration speeds that can only be measured in Mach, and the cornering ability of a cheetah.The recovery times of the AI's cars when tricked or pushed into obstacles seems like a huge hand follows them and quickly corrects any mishaps. When you find yourself losing because you nick some corner within 100 feet of the finish, but had been in the lead until then, you want to chuck the cd's out the window. I used to be a fan of NFS series, but this installment has me doubting I'll every purchase it again."
3,Not as good as previous versions,"I have been buying and playing Need for Speed since the first version. I will have to say that I was excited when this game was released, but let down once I started playing the game. As with all NFS games, the graphics are great; but with this one it seems that the options are limited relating to the types of games you can play. One thing I loved from the NFSUG2 was the free roam in the streets, which this one does not have. It is almost impossible to win any races due to the PC catching up with you no matter which car you are racing. These are just a few of the dissapointments I have and this will probably be the last NFS I buy."
5,title for my review,"Great game, lots of play time, sometimes funny, sometimes makes you mad, but never boring!"
5,White knucle thrill ride!,"Currently playing the PC Demo: Every once and awhile a game comes along that just blows the doors of anything else out there. Today that game is NFS: Most Wanted. The graphics and AI are surpurb. The fictional world in which your racer inhabits is painstakingly real & enormous (event though you can't see most of it due to blistering speeds)The physics & the game-play give a feeling of REAL speed!Game of the year HANDS DOWN!! A must have.only one thing troubles me; No instant replay option in the Demo, I would love to see the Havoc I'm reeking from the cops' point of view. Does the full version have this feature?"
5,"great film,just as great music!","coleman/shore together are like what miles davis and angelo badalamenti would've come up with!yes,it's that good!have a few stiff drinks,pop this in,and close your eyes..."
5,Insightful Guidelines To Evangelism,"Many extremely helpful pointers to finishing the work of the gospel. Insightful guidelines from one gifted with prophetic views for the unique work to be done in various regions. Read the advice of someone given the vision to forsee the needed work for many of our urban areas; advice forseen over 100 years ago that remains very pertinent today. Even the prediction of much larger increases in population for certain cities, like my own birthplace of Los Angeles. Almost stunningly accurate."
2,low cost/performance gel,This gel disintegrates into a thin liquid rapidly so it may be suitable for quick tests only. Its impedance matching characteristics are not too ideal when compared to standard ultrasonic gels either.
5,Great stuff!,"Arrived on time and easy to use. Would purchase again. The local vet office uses this as well, so I know I'm getting a good product."
3,Too Slow,"Variations on a Rococo Theme is too slow. If you are not a big fan of Hanna, you may not want to buy this debut recording."
3,"Pretty, but too slow","I agree on the Rococo variations being a little too slow (and Fauré too). But the real disaster here is Bruch's Kol Nidrei which is played so foooott-draggiinngg slow that you are getting desperate. Kol Nidrei should not sound like that! Chang takes 12.37 to play this lovely piece, but listen to Andrew Lloyd Webber or - in my opinion the best Kol Nidrei ever - Christina Walewska, they are both around 10.30, and they are making real music out of it. (The Casals version I've heard is playing just about 9.30, that's to the fast side.) Of course music is not all about speed, but if you get the feeling of an old vinyl single played at 33 rpm instead of 45, there is definitely something wrong. - But of course Chang is playing prettily."
5,An essential reference,"For anyone who loves the West -- Old or New -- this innovative atlas must find a place on your bookshelf. Created at the University of Colorado's Center of the American West, it charts beautifully and eloquently how the American West has evolved. This volume will help you understand how some myths of the West grew out of proportion to the facts, and how some are not myths at all, but semi-fantastic truths.To understand the contemporary West, this book would be a good starting place."
4,good,this is a good remover..but the pads are sorta rough...could be softer...but it's durable...efficient when remove makeup..i would try oil-free next time...
1,Changed pad material -- now ROUGH and SCRATCHY!!,"Typical -- be the best product out there, kill the competition, then change the product to a far inferior (but cheaper to produce) version. Almay makeup remover pads are no longer super soft cotton, but some kind of synthetic, scratchy material. I refuse to use them -- God knows what I'd be doing to my skin."
4,just perfect!,"I have tried many different eye make-up removers for years, branded, unbranded, and this one is just perfect!!Here are the pros and cons for this product:Pros1.Perfect for travelers!! You will have no problem for security check!!2.You don't need to spend extra money on cotton pad3.Easy application - it removes liner, mascara without irritating your eyelids4.It doesn't give you dryness after you use this productCons1.It runs out pretty quicklyI LOVE it :)"
1,Disgustingly Oily,I normally use a different version of the product. The purple one which I am thinking is oil-free or something because I bought these at the store since it was all there was and they are DISGUSTING. I am surprised no one else has commented about this. It makes everything all oily. It removes the makeup great but makes me want to vom with all the oil on my fingers and face. Do you like to rub oil on your eyes? BlehI am going to see if CVS will take it back!
3,"Not great, not horrible..","It definitely does take your eye makeup off of your eyes, but it also leaves them a little oiled up. To greasy of a product to use in the morning if you are rushing to work and make an eyeliner mistake. Should only be used at night when you have plenty of time to wash your face thro-ly."
5,"great songs, great quality","Yet more music to add to my classic rock collection. The audio quality was fantastic and I really liked the tracks in this disk as well. And of course, DRM free!"
5,The best.,I love this collection. I can't ever forget the wonderful sounds made by The Carpenters. I play this collection frequently.
2,"SINGLES,YES-MAGNUM OPUS,NO!","I would have to say that this is probably the worst Carpenters album you could buy.Most of Karen Carpenter's hit singles were not her best work,and combining alot of these klunkers on one album(sing,top of the world,please mr postman,etc.)makes a very monotonous listening experience.I also agree with the reviewer below,the remixes on this album are horrible.The structure and sound of the original recordings have been devastated.Skip this album-I would recommend the new ESSENTIAL COLLECTION,which contains many of the original recordings,plus alot of her great jazz material-This masquerade,Ordinary Fool,Little Girl Blue,A song for you,etc.Also,the remastering on ESSENTIAL is outstanding!"
3,It's OK,I wanted to round out my music collection. I didn't have any of the Carpenters so thought this would be a good addition for $.99. It has some (not all) of their famous songs and is good to listen to in the background. Kind of a feel good album.
4,Carpenters comeback?,"Loved the low price! I only paid .99 cents, and I got the classics they were loved for! Loved it"
4,Blast from the Past,"I always made fun of the Carpenters as a youngster, but secretly loved Karen's voice. I wanted a girlfriend who could sing love songs to me with a voice like hers.....This album has many of the best Carpenter songs and I am happy to have it in my collection."
5,Such a beautiful voice!,"I got this at Christmas and can't stop listening to it. Karen had such a beautiful voice, I had forgotten what a great sound the Carpenters had. It makes me sad listening to it because it reminds me how tragic Karens death was and what music has missed out on without her. Such a one of a kind voice, no one like it before or since. I love this."
1,"I don't really hate it, I just never got it","I thought I bought this, but apparently it never downloaded to either my PC or iPad. Haven't listened to it, so I don't know whether I like it or not."
5,Great Music,I had not heard the Carpenters for years. I was in my thirties when they were doing music. It was great being able to listen again.
4,Carpenters 1969-1981,"I bought this CD for my wife because she really likes the Carpenters. It is a great CD that has all of their big songs with a couple of extras. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars only because I like the Carpenters but I'm not ""crazy"" about them, but that isn't really their fault"
5,favorite groups,Carpenters has always been one of my favorite singers. Never had an album of them. Great buy for a great group
5,The Carpenters,I have always loved their music and this was a steal at .99 cents. I love it. I was so happy to see this where I could afford it. Thanks Amazon.
4,Memories!,"Ah, these songs really bring bring back the memories for my parents, so made a great gift for them. Individually I remember these songs playing as a kid, and a quickly pulled out playlist for them made them smile."
4,My fave,I like it. Give me more relax when coming home from work. The sound is clear and nice. It OK to me.
5,A Pleasure,They were my favorite in that era. Anything that they sung I enjoyed and loved to sing along with. Thank you
3,more remixed singles,"Sure, Karen's voice is great, and a lot of these songs are great. Richard's contributions to their original recordings were also substantial. What's so disappointing about this release, however, is that many of these songs have been remixed with musical parts recorded after Karen's death. Richard has done this many times before. Despite the original album mixes FINALLY coming out on cd, I guess he just couldn't help himself here and felt he had to remix their singles, once again. Unfortunately several of their original singles differed from their lp versions, and in some cases those single versions have yet to see a proper reissue on cd. I anticipated that this collection would do so, since it came out just after the album remasters series. Very disappointing.This is therefore a collection for two groups: Carpenters completists who want everything and those who just want most of the Carpenters' biggest hits but don't care if they don't sound exactly like the original singles."
4,Hits,At $2 this was worth it. Takes me back to my youth. I would recommend this product to others. Delivered as promised.
3,It's the Carpenters,"If you like the Carpenters you will appreciate this collection of songs. However, I found two negatives. One, the sound quality was not consistent from track to track. And two, a few of their significant recordings were not included."
4,A Must for Carpenters Fans,This album has many of the Carpenters classics but lacks the Bless the Beasts and the Children. That would make this album complete. That's why I couldn't give is five stars.
5,Great variety of Carpenter hits!,"If you love the Carpenters, this is a great choice. All my favorites were on here, plus I got some others for what it would have cost me to buy the others one at a time."
5,The Best of the Carpenters,This is a great collection of the Carpenters Greatest Hits. Listening to Karen Carpenter's voice singing those wonderful songs brought back many memories of those early years of my life. I would highly recommend purchasing this collection of song by the Carpenters.
5,"one of the funniest, best books I've read in a long time","I don't know how I missed this when it first came out, but it was funny, touching and just great escape reading. I could relate to a nice Jewish girl living with someone so far outside the faith and her family's reactions. The aunt and uncle were true to form, we all have someone like that in our family or know others who do. Just a tad dated, but doesn't take away from this most pleasurable read."
2,First published in 1980,"Oy. I bought this in 1980, read half of it, and threw it across the room, unable to believe that the author of Compromising Positions had written such crude stereotypes about materialistic Jews & alcoholic Irish. Then, unfortunately, I put it out of my mind--so I bought it again because I generally like Susan Isaacs writing. If you find the stereotypes amusing, carry on. If not, it's a skip."
4,Uncle Milty Olve Drab Travel Vest,"fits well for this heavier female, just the right length at mid-hip so that pockets are still accessible when traveling and pockets big enough for paperback books and I.D. guides, not sure what I'll use all the smaller pockets for, but I'm sure they will get filled."
4,"Pockets, pockets, pockets!!",This vest is sturdy and great for carrying all your supplies into the bush. Load the stuff you have to reach in a hurry in the front and carry the rest in a backpack.
5,Love it,"I wear a size 12 (woman). I wanted this to be fairly big for comfort when on the plane and the Large size worked great for that. Loved all the pockets, felt comfortable and secure zipping my passport and wallet into an inside pocket. Carried my medication, mints, granola bars, lip gloss, ear pods, tissue, book. And even a kid-size blanket in the big back pocket. Easy to forget which thing was in which pocket...so i finally did 'edibles' on the right and 'other' on the left :) You need a system :) The fabric is lightweight, but strong. My only problem was that i felt the back neckline of the vest was high.... with stuff in the pockets weighing the vest down, the back neckline pulled uncomfortably on my neck, so i did trim and re-sew that back neckline to be lower. It was easy going through the security check, just took off the vest and put the whole thing in the bin."
4,"Great price, great product",This product was available at lots of various vendors online for prices up to $150+. This seems to be just a well made as the more expensive ones but with a great price.
4,Works as promised!,"Delivered very promptly. Workmanship seems very good. I use it to walk our dogs (4 of 'em) and keep spare leashes, poop bags, etc., all together so I can grab and go."
1,So-so singing,"Her songs are good but she fails to do them justice. Her voice is so airy and ethereal that it lacks body and she sounds as though she is wailing away. The air plays a large part in her lack of control of her voice. In track 3, she sounds as though she is singing with fishballs in her mouth - it was hard for me to distinguish whether she was singing in Mandarin or Cantonese! Red Bean and Face are good songs but then again, with Faye's insipid voice, it's hard for her to control."
2,What A Load Of Crock,"Like most artists from Hong Kong, Faye is as manufactured as the come. And like most creative ideas out of Hong Kong (and East Asia, for that matter), it is merely a rip off from the West...in this case, Iceland. From the music, right down to the cover, it's Bjork. I see that she finally got out of her Tori Amos phase. This woman does not have a shred of originality. As Dennis Miller said at the MTV Music Awards after he introduced Faye Wong: ""Faye Wong.... Please..."""
4,Nothing short of the best!,"Faye Wong, THE top Asian female singer in the world, is back with an all new album from EMI. And of course she doesn't disappoint! Starting with the first 3 tracks her voice is perfect and flawless, especially in track 2, where she sings extremely well. And not to mention Faye composed 4 songs on the album (the best 4 on the cd) This is a great CD for old and new listeners! The whole thing is great, although not as strong as some of her other albums. But still, if you've never heard of her, buy this album; you won't regret it! She can cast a spell on the listener lkie no other singer. I'm not even Chinese (don't under any Chinese or Canto either) and I love this singer, proves just how powerful she is. :)"
4,Romanovs,Best table book that I have seen on the Romanovs fantastic life style that many felt ruined russia. such a wild and crazy ride
2,False expectation,"The earrings looked great online, but when I received them they were not what I expected."
3,Pregnant with twins,I found this product to only be somewhat helpful. It reduced my nausea but only for about 20 minutes or so. You would have to suck on them constantly for them to be really effective. I personally think that Ginger gum and good 'ol crackers work better.
4,drop the ginger,so I got these with the drops. for me the drops were too sour and they irritated my mouth allot. I can live without the ginger flavor but i don't like ginger to begin with. The lavander wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and am wishing I had one now (but I am out here to order more) I took away a star mainly because I wish more came in a pack...
1,Nice concept but doesn't deliver,"This product is a great concept but unfortunately didn't work for me. Every pregnant woman is different with her intolerances and triggers for nausea so while this product did nothing for me, it may help someone else. In fact the flavors made me more queasy. I will stick to my lemon drops and peppermints."
3,Meh,"I felt that these did nothing to help my morning sickness. I also didn't really care for the flavor of the ones I tried. Also, lavender? No thank you."
3,OK but some were received broken,"These are ok. I like having the pop version of the Preggie drops because if the taste gets too strong or gets to be too much, I can take a break from it and pop it out of my mouth for a few minutes. Some flavors are more gingery or more sour and others are lightly sweet. The pops are flat and thin, so they are brittle. There were only a handful in the box and of those, some of them arrived broken, which makes the lollipop aspect a bit unusable. Therefore, I thought they were overpriced and would not buy again. They didn't help my nausea but they did help the constant metallic/acid taste I had in my mouth for a long time during the later first trimester. However, I did as well using a lemon-filled cola flavored lollipop (regular candy, not pregnancy specialty) I bought from a German company."
1,Over priced candy,These didn't really do much for me. The only ones I could stand were the lemon..and even then they didn't help. Try getting regular hard candies instead...they will cost a lot less.
3,Lacking Substance...,I love the books and wanted to see the anime. Unfortunately it's only in Japanese. I could deal with that. Episodes 1-11 were right on que with the comics. The last episode though left more questions than answers. It was well drawn and animated. It just lacked substance with the last episode. The series could have gone longer and deeper in depth. Basically it was like eating chicken soup with nothing but the broth.
5,I fell in love,The story is sweet. There is a lot of same gender (kissing boy/boy and girl/girl) so if that's not your thing you will not like this. I loved the fantasy elements and just got into the story. I only wish there were more episodes.
5,Classy anime choice,"Loveless is a great shonen-ai series to own; I completely adore it. With great animation and lovable characters, it's hard not to enjoy it."
1,Can these guys solo in more then one key? NO!!!!,"I opened for these guys in Vegas and let me tell you these guys ARE NOT PLAYING ANYTHING THAT RESEMBLES JAZZ!! The band I play with does music ranging from Holdsworth, Corea, Metheny and Tribal Tek to Dregs -> Herbie to Trane, Shorter etc.. THAT'S JAZZ. JACOB FRED HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH JAZZ OR FUSION!!! IT'S ROCK JAM GARBAGE!!! THEY DON'T SOLO OVER CHANGES. THEY SOLO OVER BOARING LONG ONE KEY VAMPS.To the guy that makes the insulting remark about going back and listening to the Dave Matthews band if you don't get these guys. WELL LET ME TELL YOU I LISTEN AND HAVE LISTENED AND PEFROMED MUSIC WAY OVER THE HEADS OF ANYONE IN THAT BAND.THESE GUYS ARE LAME AND DEAF"
1,they're awful,"i saw jacob fred jazz odyssey live in new york at the village underground, and they were the worst improvisational jazz band i have ever seen. i have listened to my fair share of jazz, and the jacob fred jazz odyssey has nothing special, and i want to go on record as saying: the drummer is by far the best musician in the band, the piano player has a lot of potential, and the bass player is the worst bass player i have ever seen, playing his bass half the time tuned up like a guitar. this technique does nothing for the band's songs. in the end, my biggest problem is that jacob fred jazz odyssey's jams don't really go anywhere, it's just jamming for the sake of jamming."
1,GAH! it almost ruined my mac,I am in no words computer illiterate. Ive worked with them all my life. i purchased this game after my friend said i might enjoy it. after downloading the game which seemed to take forever it barely worked and froze oh every 2.3 milliseconds. I will be putting this in the donate pile.
5,THE BEST CONJUNTO,I HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS CD BY CONJUNTO RIO GRANDE BUT I DO KNOW THAT THEY SING REALLY GOOD AND ANY CD THAT YOU BUY FROM THEM IS GREAT
5,Tonka Force 4 x 4 Truck,"I bought this for my son's 2nd birthday. His entire world consists of trucks, hummers,""Cars"" vehicles, and construction vehicles (or so he thinks). He loves this truck! I was extremely impressed with the size and durability of the truck. Durability is a high priority on my list when it comes to my Baby Bullmoose! I did not expect it to have any educational value........it's a truck; so, don't be discouraged by the rating on education. It's a great truck for busy, little guys to play with and knock around!"
5,Tastes great!,"These bars are awesome! They taste like they would be very naughty, but I don't worry when I have one once in a while and the mint flavor really hits the spot."
5,Got to have it!,"This is the type of music you want to play and hear at least twice a week in your car, at work, at home...you know. For any collection, it is a must!"
5,Perfect Kids Raincoat,"We bought 3 - one for each kid. They're lightweight, easily compress for stuffing into a book bag, and keep the rain off. They also have held up to the general rough-and-tumble exposure that any child puts clothing through."
2,an okay guided reading book,"I teach third grade and was looking for an historical fiction book for my below level readers. The book is okay. It isn't very well written and throws in historical facts, helter-skelter without much flow. My kids did seem to enjoy it but it had a lot of terminology they didn't understand and it didn't do a good job of explaining the meaning. There were also too many characters and they weren't well developed. The meanest characters in the book were named ""Mr. and Mrs. Meaney."" Not very original. I doubt I will use it again for guided reading."
4,Review of Westward to Home,"This is a story of a boy who is about to set out on the Oregon Trail. His grandpa gives him a journal to write about the journey westward, but instead his grandpa goes with him. It tells the story of a young boy traveling westward and the difficulties that take place. Many people die while they are on the Oregon Trail from illness and other things. It mostly takes place while they are on the Oregon Trail. I thought this was a pretty good story telling about the Oregon Trail."
2,It was okay I guess,"The majority of the comic acts are unknown - possible because they weren't that good but the video does feature the bigger names - Martin Lawrence, Chris Tucker, Bernie Mac (and a couple of the other Kings Of COmedy) to name a few. To be fair about 40% of the material was funny and a few had me ""messed up"" but the bottom line is these videos are old as hell, ""classics"" for want of a better word!! A lot of the references are from the mid 90's but the better material was timeless. The funniest comedien did jokes about roaches in New York apartments, ghetto women who love to fight and HIV candidates. Tasteless maybe but FUNNY AS [HECK]! Neither good nor bad...but is it worth nearly [amt.]......Nah! P.S The box set is basically comprised of titles you can buy separately online at Amazon (sorry but I can't be asked to go downstairs to verify which ones)"
4,good read,This book was worth reading once. It's not the type of book I would read over and over again though.
2,Very Surprised,Wait until another vendor can sell this product.I just got my Hellboy today and was extremely disappointed.The box was already opened and in terrible condition.His right arm fell off.The holster for his gun tore as if someone had tried sewing it back together.I paid 124 dollars for this product and it looked as if I got it from a swap meet.
4,Great Product,Good Value for the Money Feels good on your face!Nice scent!I always appreciate a moisturizer with spf 15!
2,Disappointing,"This lotion appears to be a fabulous consistency, but it seems to be all it has going for it. The SPF and fragrance are a bit potent. The most disappointing part of this lotion is the extremely oily feel it leaves on your face. Itdoes not absorb well and stays very sticky. Do not attempt to put makeup on over it either. As a neutrogena loyalist, this product makes me sad."
3,pretty good moisturizer,"Moisturizers pretty well. I don't think it's that intensive, but works ok. Face feels moisturized for a typical 16 hour day. Nothing extremely speical."
3,This Was Sortof A Ripoff,"This looked like a good toy,but it had some problomes. It was neat,but it did'nt have any weapons at all. It's arms did'nt streath eather. All it came with was a backpac/car and wings."
5,Great guide to inform and direct you !,"This is another fave of mine from Gene Florence!He sure knows what he is writing about!!!This book is loaded with color photos of many different types of depression glass.I never realized how many patterns,and companies,there were out there!!!He also is very thorough about listing what pieces were in what colors and the values for each color.Overall a fantastic book!"
2,Really Brief,"The reason why people buy official strategy guides in the first place is because they need in depth helps.This guide book is really brief hardly telling you where key items are and how to defeat bosses and the right team combinations and skills to use.Legend of Dragoon is a complicated game and the guide book does not help by briefly describing on the dragoon power, how to boost it up .......It could have been better"
2,Basic Walk-through,"This guide is good for a basic walk-through. It tells you where to go and does give some strategy. It makes a poor attempt at locating items. It does give a list before each section, but it is often incomplete. I wouldn't mind minor items, but they should've at least located all weapon upgrades and stardust(in the walk-through, not just in the table of charts in the front of the book).If you do get this guide, watchout for the stradust error. The guide tells you that you can go back for all stardusts at the end of the game. There is one that has to be taken before a certain event. Now in the list it has its location and (before event) but in the stardust section intro it says don't bother looking in that town until after the event. And again in the walk-through it doesn't mention that particular stardust. So beware."
2,Alright,"If your looking for something to give you a basic plot outline and tell you where to go next then here you go; but, if your looking for an in-depth strategy guide with secrets etc. Look elsewhere. Overall another rushed book."
2,another rushed book,This book is good for the basic walkthrough but does not give much info. on items and sub-quests. If you want an in depth strategy guide look elsewhere.
5,So far so good,"I picked this small unit because it was on a mudroom sink that would not require a large volume of hot water at any one time (basically washing hands). I put it in line with the hot line in case I needed a large volume of hot water occasionally, and the piping is somewhat simpler that way. I installed underneath the sink so it is very accessible for the recommended annual maintenance. I do have lots of home plumbing experience, but even a novice should be able to handle, it's just connecting lines and probably a little pipe work. Getting the electrical outlet to the unit would probably be more of a challange, but I had an open breaker with the wire already run close to the unit so it was quite simple.There's nothing like having hot water come out almost instantly with no waiting."
1,failed after 8 months,I have only used this 8 months and there is so much metal pieces comming out of faucet it is plugging up. I am not at all happy with this unit and will remove it and junk it. It must be very poorly made.
4,Bosch GL2.5g water heater review,The Bosch GL2.5g water heater is well made and was easy to install. Only have 2 complaints.... The temperature control is located behind 2 panels that you need a screwdriver to remove. Really a dumb design! Also sometimes the water comes out warm other times it is really hot. The thermostat is not very accurate at all. Other than those 2 issues it gets the job done.
4,Don't forget to check/change the Anode!,"In general, I like this unit. Does what I need it to do with is to provide a small amount of hot water, immediately, without much water waste.One negative is that because this is an electric type heater, you MUST check the Anode every 1 year replace before is corrodes away and causes tank failures/water leaks.I am on my 3rd unit - but still this is a small, compact unit and does the job."
3,Great efficiency but expect leaks,"I have installed one of these under 3 different sinks over the last 8 years or so. Each of them is wired to a wind up 15 minute timer and only gets turned on when hot water is wanted. I've replaced each of them at least once. After I replaced the first 2 of them I extended the wiring and plumbing and moved them outside under the house so when it (inevitably) blows out it does not cause interior water damage. I'm still prefer to replace my most recently blown out unit with another instead of hook up the sink to an existing propane demand water heater which is further away because of the loss of efficiency associated with distance. However, in making that decision I had to factor in a life expectancy of about 3-5 years, maximum."
5,water heater,"excellent heater. no issues. easy to install. works on 115 v circuit, 15 amps with no issue even with other appliances on same circuit. would recommend."
1,No real warranty - don't buy from Bosch!,"Yes, the tankless water heater works well, but the warranty is a sham. Ours is only 3 years old and we have to buy a new one. Called Bosch after our electrician said the electricity was getting to the unit and not to the elements, but Bosch wants additional information that can only be provided by an electrician with a ""multimeter"" (while iI pay the electrician to be on hold for 40 minutes?!) and then Bosch will UPS parts out....and if that doesn't work they will replace the unit. Hey folks, that's two weeks without hot water! In addition, the folks at Bosch were just plain rude."
5,Bosch GL2.5,"We installed this after recieving it Jan. 2011 waited on posting a review until now 7 mons. later,it has been working great wife is happy she doesn't have to wait for hot water any more ."
3,Works OK,"Works ok. This is my second one, the first one rusted out and started to leak after a few years. Better tank would make it more rust proof."
4,Could Be Better,"The heater is working fine, but it could have a faster recovery period. Hot water, really hot water is not immediately available all the time. The thing we like best is that we are no longer running a gallon and a half of water down the drain or into empty milk containers before hot water comes to the kitchen tap. We live in the California desert and water is very precious."
1,Get ready for water damage,"After about a year and a half of use, the unit started leaking water out of the relief valve. No one noticed until we had significant water damage to the sink cabinet and underlying floor. Not sure what the problem is but this unit seems to have real problems with thermal expansion. I thought the whole point of these units is to eliminate the big tank. If you need a big expansion tank to deal with the water, what's the point?"
2,likes quality,"been using this for a year now. No problems. Bosch is a quality name. I have been familiar w/Bosch since my foreign car garage in the '70's.The hot water temperature varies from day to day...? it ranges from lukewarm to scalding???? in the same 24 hr period. this is in my wife's bathroom so I don't use it often. (yes, we have separate bathrooms) were spoiled in America.Maybe Bosch is made in China now? It wasn't expensive. If it were square, and not rounded, it would fit better under the sink."
5,Whiteside Router Bits,What can I say... They are Whitesides! Beautifully made in the USA router bits that cut through oak like butter!
2,Disappointing,"I have read about Charlotte and Maximillian as peripheral figures in many other books and was looking forward to a book about them alone. Boy, was I disappointed. This is a fan letter to the royal couple, who in all other accounts were spoiled and difficult. There are no photos or other illustrations, no genealogical tables to help sort out the relatives, and worst of all, no index, footnotes, or references. A high school student could do a better job. I am still not entirely sure if this is fiction or non fiction, the author seems to operate half on conjecture and the other on wishful thinking!"
2,Simply simple,"An overly simplistic attempt at history, this book is definied by its failure to satisfy on any level.Initially I was disappointed by the lack of pictures, and maps, always useful when reading history. As I reached the middle of the book, it became clear that such trappings would have done little to improve matters.Written with the inexplicable self-confidence of a nineteen year old, the author hovers at fingertips length over history, all the while dispensing with moral judgements, and grand pronouncement of little to no value.Pass this one up. You will thank me."
3,Say farewell,"This book should have been more informative....and it really wasn't. Charlotte was a daughter of the King of Belgium, 1st cousin to Queen Victoria, sister-in-law to the powerful Emperor Franz Joseph, and yet the book was just an empty shell at points. There was no genelogical table for reference, and no pictures except on the cover to even think about how truely beautiful Charlotte was until she went insane. There is evidence that says it might have been easier for her to do so to escape her brother, but she was certainly (and who could blame her) never able to handle the loss of Maximilian the way she did.Check this out @ the library, buy it if you really think you need to add it to your collection, but this was not the steller book it should have been. Heres to hoping someone else will do it better next time!!"
1,The Empress of Farewells,"This ""biography"" should be listed under historical fiction. There are no footnotes, family tree, indices, photographs or a bibliography. I find it very difficult to believe and seriously doubt that anyone in the 1860's, especially a cosseted female princess, would supposedly use a phrase in a letter, such as ""between a rock and a hard place"". That slang term is decidely too modern. I would not recommend this book for the novice history buff. Only those of us who have read extensively on Europeon royalty would understand the relationships between the families and would know who came from where and how closely related the individuals were. I do not think much scholorship went into this book. The only item of interest I learned was that Carlotta died in Belgium and not in Trieste at Miramar."
1,"Poorly written, poorly done","What could have been a good book is truly disappointing. Beyond the missing elements mentioned in other reviews -- no bibliography, photos, or substantive evidence of any research -- the text is poorly written and badly edited. Dates fly around with no consequece to linear events. A visit of October 8, 1866, is described as concluding a few days later, on October 11, 1867. Diaz engaged in a battle in 1876, and the next sentence refers to his death in 1872. What kind of writer does this? What kind of editor allows this?Innuendo aplenty, facts not so much. Save your money and save your time; don't bother with this book."
4,Introduced My Mother-in-Law to Ishi,"Got to talking to my Mom-in-Law about an article about Ishi in TRADITIONAL BOWHUNTER, which she read in its entirety. She is from that area of California and didn't know the story, which she found fascinating. Ended up buying her a couple of Ishi books for Christmas. If you're a serious student of the subject you'll consider the original books ""foundational"", as they show the cultural biases of the period. Still spellbinding reading."
3,The Story of a Man and an Epoch,"This is a very important book and a very sad book. It tells an extraordinary story of a man who was last man of his tribe. It also an honest history of the white man's inhumanity to the red man in California during the second half of the ninetheenth Century.The story is: Ishi hid in the mountains nearly all of his life. After his Yahi tribesmen died, he drifted into a small town. He was rescued by an anthropologist and lived the remainder of his short life on the grounds of a San Francisco museum."
2,"Good Book, bad binding","I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the story of Ishi. However, the binding on the new paperback fell apart before I was half way through it."
5,One of my ten best books,"Where was the Pulitzer committee the year this biography appeared? Mrs. Kroeber captured a difficult subject with historical and technical command and emotional and human depth. One comes away with a sense that if Ishi was representative of primitive man, civilized man does not compare all that better. I disagree with the review below that Drs. Kroeber, Waterman, etc. used Ishi somewhat demeaningly. Ishi had an ethic of self-sufficiency. His museum work enabled him to earn board and room plus a sufficient salary while working in his own field of expertise. In this way, he and his friends left an immense contribution to anthropology, one that Mrs. Kroeber has described in one of the most compelling biographies any adult or child will ever read."
3,"Interesting, yet confusing organization","I have this on Kindle PC. It is a great price, if you get it online. It does not matter which version you get, but the content remains the same.I had to read this for my California history class. Part 1 is the background about Ishi; however, it is long, boring, but it is interesting, and not an easy read. Part 2 is fascinating really, but I found some odd typos. This book is great and all, but to think they came out with so many versions that this book still has ""off the topic"" subjects. For instance, the book talks about Ishi's people, and then talks about other Native American tribes. The transitioning and context are quite confusing and irrelevant. I felt that they wanted to add random facts to make the book longer; this is just confusing.The book needs be revised for sure, since the evidence were based of the early 1900s documents of the author's husband."
5,Wonderful book !!,"We purchased this book for our son and he was amazed by the clarity, etc. ..... an awesome book and extremely pleased"
5,Good book for learning to think,"This book cost less than two at the movies. The knowledge I obtained from this book enabled me to memozize thousands of pages from networking manuals. I successfully became a networking engineer with a major corporation. Before I became a engineer, I used the techniques to become a Visual Basic programmer. Which required me to memorize thousands of commands and sub-routines. I would recommend this book to anyone attempting to succeed in a internet based society."
2,Misleading,"I was misled by the review and description of this book, it is not stories but organ music for an instrument I don't even own. Even if I did own it, I would like to know what I am getting beforehand. I was looking for the writings of John Lennon, and received this instead. So if you want the music for an electric keyboard organ thingie, by all means get it, but if you're looking for writings, keep looking."
1,Misleading review,"I was highly misled by the review that is listed for this ""book"". I expected to receive a story by John Lennon. Instead, I received a song book for organ, piano, and keyboard, and I'm highly disappointed that I spent my money on it. Granted, it's a perfect book for someone who WANTS a ""songbook"". Needless to say, I didn't. The person who reviewed this book was definitely misleading in every sense of the word."
1,Find another version,"We bought this collection - all public domain films - because we're big Cagney fans. We'd seen Something to Sing About previously. Not a very good film, but Cagney is delightful in it; we love to see him dance. And the music is good. While the other two films are in pretty poor shape, this one was absolutely wretched. Every few seconds there were cuts. Every single scene had missing pieces, missing dialogue, missing music. Most of the opening credits and the end were just gone. Yeah, it didn't cost very much, but it's still shocking that someone would market such a mess. Really unethical."
5,Mitch & Amy,"I REALLY liked this one. A lot. A lot a lot. It was a great portrayal of twins, and I'm sure any twins reading would have gotten a kick out of it. Again, classic Ramona-type material/humor. The alternating chapters were great, and surprisingly for once, I found myself relating to the male character, Mitch, more than Amy, who struck me as kind of a stuck up spoiled brat. The problems the twins deal with are common ones, though, particularly the bully problem (""He's the type who's nice to grown ups but not to kids."" How many of us know a person like that?) Minor detail, I adored that the kids considered ""school"" a bad word, I would have definitely done that as a kid. The only thing I disliked was the ending--I felt some more resolution, a more significant scene, was needed between the twins.Rating: 5/5"
3,Great DVD Quality Very Slow Responsiveness,"Plays Blu Ray beautifully but seems unresponsive at times take for example when I insert a disc, then it starts to read, then I select to eject it or stop it ignores my request until it has fully read the dvd."
3,"Enjoyable, but marred by the ending","No need to go in much detail here - I agree almost point by point with the earlier review by J. C. Foster (which is interesting since we have reviewed some of the same books before and usually seem to disagree), especially about the ending. Read it, and decide for yourself if the events of the story justify the way it ends. Or maybe we'll just have to wait for the sequel to find out (""Sebastian of Mars"", due to be published in September)."
4,Neutrogena Foot Cream,Even though the packaging is different there is a slight difference in the vehicle of the produce. I can use the procdut and I like how it makes my feet feel especially right after a shower.
4,This works great and doesn't feel oily or ...,This works great and doesn't feel oily or leave an unpleasant smell. I'd use this again.
3,hazy photos,A 167 p hardback of which around a third is (at times quite poetic) prose and the rest largely color photos. They can be a bit hazy at times but give you a feeling of this area of Croatia
2,Too Fragile for shipping.,These are beautiful mugs but when I ordered three sets of four...each package arrived with one mug handle broken.The china is very fragile and seems poorly made.Shame because the pattern is lovely.
4,The Future is in the History,"It was an enlightening experience and one that Ken Burns meticulously wove together in an entertaining documentary.It left me rather open mouthed at the tenacity of these inventors to make something out of literally nothing. They knew they were onto something big and this reflected well in their fierce ambitions, open jealousy, criticism and bitter litigation.It wasn't fair then and it isn't now.But it was admirable and almost impossible what these three, De Forest, Sarnoff and most notably Armstrong, achieved for what they, then, could not have foreseen.The explosion of media we have today.Blessing or a curse?Pity there wasn't more about Marconi."
4,Very Informative,"Radio is one of the greatest inventions of the 20th Century. It contributed a great deal to the mass commercialization of the United States and entertained thousands. It was one of the earliest entertainment mediums that was free and available to people of diverse backgrounds, from poor farmers to wealthy socialites.This documentary follows the lives and careers of the three major players in radio's history: Lee DeForest, the self-proclaimed father of radio who invented the audion tube, which made amplification possible; Edwin Howard Armstrong, the man who explained how the audion tube worked and discovered FM radio; and David Sarnoff, who turned radio into a major empire and then channeled it into television.Empire of the Air is informative and filled with interviews and archival photographs. It is in the typical style of Ken Burns, steadily paced and full of information."
2,"without tesla, there is no radio","I was deeply saddened by the total ommission of NikolaTesla from this show about the radio. It is inconceivable that not once is the guy who actually invented wireless mentioned. Very shoddy research.Tesla was awarded all of the patents that Marconihad tried to steal from Tesla, and as everyone knows,Lee Deforest was a hack and who basicallystole most of his ideas from Armstrong.Thank God Burns didn't do a show about Edison being a genius or I would have had a stroke."
4,A rare bargain in computer books,"I use Photoshop LE for web pages and photo touchup, and having gotten the program as a freebie with another Adobe package, I'm somewhat allergic to paying ( ) for the typical photoshop manual.Enter Teach Yourself books. This British publisher has been around as long as I can remember, producing simple and useful manuals for, it sometimes seems, every possible human endevor, and now they're doing excelent comuter books.This slim volume may not be as exhaustive a reference as some of the 500 page tomes out there, but it's complete, it answered all my questions, and at under ( ) it's a steal"
3,"Well, it was interesting.","I don't usually go out of my way to pay a few bucks for an online movie that I know nothing about. But the storyline caught my attention and I'm an Ellen Page fan so, what the heck. It was certainly a taboo topic for a film starring a teenage character. A little frightening I'd say. Basically, it comes down to this:It was interesting. Not my favorite movie ever. Maybe I'd watch it again one day. I personally found it a bit anticlimactic. Not that it needed car chases or explosions, just maybe a different route with the ending.Anyway, if you're bored and enjoy a flick about an unlikely heroine, then go ahead."
3,Interesting and dark movie,"I thought the plot of the movie was weird, but the performances were amazing. I also enjoyed the look of the movie and the way it was directed; very interesting and suspenseful. I would say it is perhaps better as a rental than one to own because I doubt I'll ever be compelled to watch it again, but it was worth watching once since Ellen Page is excellent in it."
4,Her Sugar is Raw... Miss Last Stop Candy Shop,"A Death and the Maiden or Extremities for the pedophile generation. This still packs a punch, however. Wilson and Page are both great in this vicious cat-and-mouse thriller about a supposed pedophile and a young girl. Some very tense, squirm-inducing scenes and some sly direction come together for this satisfying thriller. Madonna and Guy Ritchie at play?"
4,this is a very difficult movie to watch or certainly to even contemplate.,"This movie is a great big surprise, one of extreme vengeance and really quite horrible at that. Of course, this little Page girl is terrific, but she is quite deliberate and scary in this movie. Frankly ,it was recommended by my son and I do not know whether or not I would recommend it to anyone else."
1,Hardly Candy,"Well, this movie sucked.Yeah yeah, it's about a young girl getting revenge on some guy for blah blah blah.Yes, the girl was smart, and yes it's plausible...sort of.The whole movie just comes of very formulaic.There's really no surprise and the absence of any real explanation for who the girl is (other than the personification of revenge) just serves to make this coming off as trying to be deeper than it really is.It's like they tried too hard.Oh yeah, and the dialog is corny too.Better luck next time, I guess."
1,Preposterous & Vile,"Absurd premise made even worse by repulsive plot. All I can see is a creepy 40 year-old male screen writer who has never had a girlfriend thinking, ""Yes! This is edgy!"" as he types away. The fatal flaw in this film is: I was praying for the pseudo pedophile to kick the smarmy, twisted little bitch's ass; but I GUESS, I was supposed to be rooting for her???? Horrifically misguided - less of a ""point"" than Beavis and Butthead."
5,WOW!!!,May be one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. Plot is slightly implausable but the acting is supurb. Ellen Page is one amazing young actress.
1,Disaster!!,"When I saw the preview for Hard Candy ahead of whatever artsy-fartsy movie I saw at the downtown cinema, I was excited. I thought it was really going to knock my socks off.Instead, I wasted a spot on my Netflix queue and got bored, yo.I will give it this: I can appreciate how edgy the movie was *meant* to be. But it fell horribly, terribly flat. Page (who is supposedly *so* intense as Haley) is a snotty little creep. Kohlver is a snotty grown-up creep. I don't feel any sympathy or compassion for either of them. And I'm not buying the whole teenager-tracks-down-criminal-and-makes-him-pay routine. What is she supposed to be, Encyclopedia Brown or something?Basically, the story heads into areas that it really should just avoid. I can't help but think that the intended result was for me to get all up in arms and shudder and tremble and think to myself ""Oh wow - what a terribly intense film.""Sorry...not buying it."
2,Where was Sandra Oh?,"Man, for receiving top billing on the movie, you'd think that Sandra Oh would've had more than two minutes of screen time as a curious neighbor delivering girl scout cookies.The DVD case says ""Fatal Attraction for a new generation"".Not even close. This movie tried too hard to be good, and didn't come through.I was suckered in to watch it because I'm a movie buff. I don't regret watching it, but I won't be talking to many friends about it.I was disappointed with the product, wished that there was more Sandra Oh (based only on the billing), and thought it dragged."
1,This has been done MUCH better!,"Stagebound, interminably talky, contrived and dull, until it collapses into complete inanity in the final act. This movie has garnered a lot of cachet because people are scandalized by the subject matter. It's really badly written, though.'Freeway' was a far superior film in every possible respect.Page is simply obnoxious. Wilson gives a better performance than the material deserves. And the director struggles vainly to make the boring single setting interesting, but his TV commercial background leaves him ill-equipped.Ignore the hype on this one - at least until you've seen the excellent 'Freeway.'"
4,Hard Candy,I enjoyed this movie. I also watched it with several friends and they all watched and liked it. They did say that it wasn't anything that they expected and they said that it was as equally funny as disturbing. I enjoyed the young girls performance as Haley. He mannerisms were just perfect when she was doing the young girl part. The guy who played the photographer/predator was also very good. It was one of those movies where you just loved seeing this guy who is a real scum get tormented.Good flick
1,Aweful.,"After watching this movie, i have to tell you... i thought it was horrible. The acting was lame at best, the script was terrible and unfolded like a ripped up napkin. The ending was an obvious attempt at a stupid twist which could be seen coming a mile away. Further more, this movie wasnt difficult to watch or taboo in anyway to me. It was just another crappily directed low-budgeted movie."
5,Hard Candy with Ellen Page,The DVD arrived as good as new. It was safely wrapped and in good condition. I would purchase from the same seller again
2,The Uses of Disenchantment,"Yeeouch! Think ""I Spit on Your Grave"" with a very good art director. ""Audition"" for the Lolita set. If you feel Kevin Bacon got off too easy in ""The Woodsman,"" or you enjoy sitting through entire ""Law and Order: SVU"" marathons on TNT, this film has something for you. Everyone else be advised to stay far, far away."
3,ultimately gratuitous and manipulative,"Although I was impressed with Pages acting, that is what kept me watching up till the castration scene when I decided I'd had enough. This was just gratuitous. Hayley's all too knowing banter that was so charming initially become tiresome as it reaches to make a political point. The character had become over wrought, over written, theatrical and the script manipulative. The philosophical dilemma the director tries to set up ; of who is worse the pedophile or the person who chooses to take the law into their own hands becomes rather simple. They are interchangeable. Although the beautiful filming and fine acting were appreciated the simplistic moral fable was in the end irritating."
1,Absolutely horrible movie,"I watched this movie originally due to Ellen Page, who is one of my favorite actresses. This movie was the worst feature I have seen in a long time. Ellen's character goes on some sort of crusade to torture a pedo (including castration.) Her character goes from bad to worse as the movie goes on. As always, she does an amazing job in the roll; however by the end of it you hope the man who was supposed to be the villian will win. Most movies I buy I buy with the intention of watching more than one time. However, the one time I watched this was quite enough, and I truly could not make it through it again. Thank God Ellen has moved on in her career because this film could have truly damaged it."
3,Not what I thought,"I was thinking it was going to be like saw, It was different but it did make me think"
1,Tedious.,Total pile for crap. Don't waste your time.... anyone w/ half a brain in their head will be watching the clock praying for the end of this movie. A definite skip.
2,Hard to swallow,"This visually spare movie has a very theatrical feel; it's shot almost entirely on a single set and has just three cast members. The performances of the two main actors are riveting and provide 90 minutes of compelling viewing. And it's these performances alone that make the film worth watching.Sadly, Hard Candy is simply too implausible and exploitative to be of any real value. Page's character is far more resourceful, remorseless, relentless, and self-assured than any 14-year-old. Her morality, which is pivotal, becomes increasingly ambiguous as the film progresses, and the violence, although it mostly takes place out of shot, verges uncomfortably close to torture porn, displacing any message that might have been intended, and polarising the viewer's sympathies. The shock tactics used here, which would be perfectly acceptable in a horror vehicle, are out of place in a film such as this."
1,Thumbs down for Ellen,"Ellen Page was so annoying in this movie, honestly the plot was dumb and the whole point of her doing what she did was not clear through out this pointless movie. I just hated it, I feel like I wasted my money renting it."
3,Revenge fantasy,"Hard Candy is an ok movie but nothing special. It is like a sort of cruel, somewhat violent fairy tale. I enjoy watching Ellen Page, and she did a good job in this, but the movie is all about one (prolonged) incident in which she gets revenge on someone. Incidentally, this movie is somewhat shocking and disturbing, but since the story does not seem particularly real, that effect wore off quickly, at least for me."
1,Hard Candy,"This movie is sick. From start to finish. Disturbing. You will have bad dreams. I understand the premise, but it went overboard."
1,disturbing movie,"all child molesters should be executed. Society in general would be better off without that scum around. Actually all very bad criminals such as molesters, rapists, and murderers should be executed. They are evil people who screw with other people's lifes.This was not a good movie, nor do i recommend it."
1,"It had potential, but ran out of gas midway through","This movie started with so much promise, but the writers did know how to bring the movie ""home"". The first seventy-five percent of the movie is intriguing, but the last twenty-five is ordinary and non-imaginary. It's climax is a let down."
5,Who really is the victim?,"During the first 15 minutes of this movie you are going to think that it is a common pedophile movie. Then it takes a ""dramatic twist"" and several other ones during the movie that will leave your ""jaw on the floor"". The psychological aspects of this movie are very shocking to say the least. Throughout the movie you are sitting there thinking ""who is the victim here?"". There is one part of the movie that all men will be squimish and make pedophiles think twist about picking up someone underage again. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes ""scarey and tortuous"" movies."
1,Gaping plot hole,"Plot hole: 14 year old girl is not old enough to engage in sexual intercourse, but she IS mature enough to have a thorough understanding of adult male sexuality and to single-handedly judge a criminal suspect and then torture and execute his punishment?The movie is filled with other contrived plot points aimed to manipulate the audience. But what pisses me off most about this psychological thriller is that it plays around with stereotypes about sexuality, only to reinforce them in the most brutal and callous fashion at the end."
4,A triumph of the good villain?,"What makes this movie to be a movie as I see, is the astonishing performing by actors. Ellen Page plays a BEAUTIFUL and unrealistically nonhuman fourteen year old teen as her counterpart is a some sort of a modern lust-filled well-earning computer-literal photo-master.This surrealism covers the entire story where semi-performed sadistic approach by a gal seeking the revenge for a killed friend, which is castration, did not distract a male villain-victim himself from energetic resistance, resulted in a triumph of the good over evil anyway.It is definitely not a ""Boy Meets Girl [Region 2]"" my review of did not appear on these pages yet for misunderstandable reasons, and it's far away from ""Hostel"" or ""Wolf Creek"", but rather a psychological drama leaving a room to suggestion what an animal the supposedly just-simply-emancipated-nowadays girl herself is."
1,Fitting Title,"It's just like the hard candy you find at your Great Aunt's house. Once you put in your mouth, you realize that it looked much better than it really is. You don't spit it out because you hold on to the hope that there's something good in the center. But all you're left with in the end is a bad taste in your mouth.It is possibly the most boring ""thriller"" I have ever seen. It's too preachy, overly moralistic, and just not very believable. I just watched it and I'm already sick of thinking about it. All I can say is- by the end of the movie- I was wishing that I was on the end of that noose."
4,Little red riding hood takes on the big bad pedophile,"I heard of this movie before and was interested to watch it. The cover alone makes you want to watch it. Practically, the entire movie is the two main characters and it does start to drag with all the talking although it's all necessary in the movie. It feels like a roller coster ride with the suspense and the script is amazing. The ""surgery"" scene alone is disturbing, I've never seen my boyfriend cower in fear before! I reccomend this to everyone."
2,Not a believable moment in it!,"This movie was filled with garbage I could not swallow. I'm sure I've met overly-mature children before, but to suggest the diabolical, calculated revenge tactics that actress Ellen Page displays, even for the sake of fiction, is beyond my belief.Would you believe I actually found myself rooting for the victim of the 32 year-old photographer??? Why? Because although his character was totally inapropriate, the story did nothing to convince me that he was the monster this little tries to get him to be. By the time she was castrating him, I swear, I wanted him to kill her.If you're going to show a 14 year-old girl taking revenge against a monster, convince me that he's a monster, and don't wait until two minutes before he hangs himself on the roof of his building to do it!"
3,"Admirable actors, abominable actions...","Patrick Wilson, and even more so, Ellen Page, do wonderful performances in this VERY unpleasant drama about psychic and physical torture. I know nothing about Miss Page, except that she has ""it"" on screen, and I am not talking about sex appeal. The movie goes on too long, and its ending is unsatisfying, since the motive for the Page character's activities is tossed off with a few words and no explanation as to how the whole series of events came to unfold. The director's choices of black screen transitions between scenes gets annoying as well. The reason for seeing this is to watch what I presume is the beginning of a great career for Ellen, and one more piece of quality work for Patrick, whom I enjoyed greatly in both ""The Alamo"" and in ""Phantom of the Opera."" But if you are squeamish about danger, tension, and degradation, skip this one."
2,Candy don't taste so good anymore...,"I can see how feminists would be all over this. 14 year old nymph gets back at an older masochist. Or is it the other way around ? I really wanted to like this film, but it was too slow and too drawn out. At some point you just feel like sceaming: OK, I GET IT ALREADY. That, and shortly after you want to slap the guy for acting/being stupid. You know she is still in the house, you have a chance to get out, but what do you do ? You go look for her. Dumbass. You deserve everything you get, all the way to the unlikely ending.And then it's over, and you still have questions. Granted, that was the intent, but it makes you feel empty, which was supposed to make you converse with other people about this film I guess. For me however, once was enough. I never need to see it again or talk about it, ever."
4,Hard Candy,Firstly the two main actors in Hard Candy were excellent and very convincing. I also like the did he didnt he element of this film. Kept me entertained until the end
1,One of the creepiest movies I've ever seen,"While the performances of the two leads are very good, I can find no excuse for this movie having been made. It is without a doubt the creepiest film I've ever seen. I don't really care what the guilt of Patrick Wilson's character is ... this kind of torture of a grown man by a teen age girl should not have been allowed whether Ellen Page's character is mentally ill or not ... it shows the justice system being turned on its head. No matter how deserving of death Wilson's character may have been, it is not helpful to a society to show this particular kind of justice being meted out. This is the first time I've ever been so severe in judging a movie and I hope I don't feel I have to do it again."
3,"Great performances, lousy ending","Ellen Page acts her little rear off in this one and Patrick Wilson does a great job too. Great performances altogether here. The ending, however, as others have alluded to, is a giant cop-out and is not set up in a way that is realistic, and there's a couple of things where it's not clear how someone as small as Haley could get a big hulking guy into the positions she got him into while he was drugged or knocked out. If you want to see great acting by a young and talented up-and-coming star, grab this. If you want a great movie... (shrug). Won't find it here, the plotting is just too weak."
4,Intense,"I'm glad that I did not read a single review here before I watched this movie because I would not have enjoyed it as much if I knew half the story.So after having said that, I urge anyone reading to stop and go rent or buy the movie. I watched it based on one trailer at the theater which gave away nothing important but the basics: Internet predator (?) meets little girl for tryst (?)The question marks are because you don't really know if those statements are true. As the movie unfolds you're treated to one surprise after another, until you get to what I had to admit was only a half satisfying ending.You never really know the girl, or what her motive is. Remove one star for that. Some people may enjoy that. I didn't.Recommended."
4,Hard to watch but worth it,"These actors give fantastic performances in a harrowing story of a young girl who turns vigilante, trying to punish a possible sexual predator. The ""castration"" scene will make you look away. Controversial, provocative, shocking, and much more."
3,Kid Saw,"Adults, don't bother. Above average teen suspense that's fairly clean in its execution but veeeery dirty in the details. I was waiting for it to end, mostly, and did not make any jokes about crossing my legs. The young girls will love this one, and rightly so. Letchy old men will be disappointed, Juno does not strip down to her birthday suit so give that pore 'lil thing a rest."
5,"""Adagio"" is very authentic !!!!!",The second movement of this great composition is indeed the most authentic version I have ever heard since I first listened to this masterpiece 25 years ago .Andre Previn's version is also excellent. I have heard John Williams's version and respectfully submit that Manuel Barrueco truly captures the soul and spirit of Joaquin Rodrigo in a Concierto clearly composed for the Gods!!!!!!
3,Mixed Bag,"The sample that plays is very nice. All the drama you'eve ever felt listening to the orchesta break through around 8.26m mark is there! The orchestration is lush and soaring. But overall, this version is barely passable. Just a bunch of robotic notes from 6.30 to 8.19m. Barely a hint of melody, and as another listener noted, the guitar-playing is almost mute at some points. There's ""quiet that lends drama,"" and then there's ""Did my mp3 player shut off?"" Overly generous pauses are followed by guitar picking beneath the threshhold of human hearing."
2,Big Disappoinment !,"We were expecting that this recording of the Concierto D' Aranjuez came out to be the best, but it shows one more time that only John Williams's recording with the Philharmonia Orchestra bring to the audience the authentic message from the composer. On Manuel's recording is very difficult to hear the guitar and the sound sometime is very weak. Manuel decided to take a lot of notes out on technical challenge parts, maybe he did not know how to practice those parts or he did not have enough time to prepare the piece. I would like to say that Placido Domigo is not a conductor, a good musician can tell the diference between this reocording conducted by Placido and a recording conducted by a real and professional conductor. I will buy twenty times John Williams's recording then this CD."
5,Nice Product - Works As Described,"If you need to put a super strong hold on a screw, bolt, or fastener or some type, then you'll need red threadlocker.Buy with confidence."
4,Not Allman Brothers but decent,I grew up listening to the Allman Brothers so I wasn't sure what to expect. I like this CD but it doesn't really compare to the old classic Allman Brothers.
2,Cheesey,Lots of cheesey cuts from the 80s when Greg was trying to remain relevent - a reflection of how bad the music was back then.
2,Mediocre coverage of a fascinating subject,"I found this at a used bookstore and it looked interesting, so I bought it. I am glad I didn't pay full price because I found it to be a disappointing approach to a deeply intriguing and relatable subject. I didn't care for his writing style, it felt sort of juvenile to me in some ways. And, while he offered some good insights, overall the collection of stories seemed contrived, overly-generalized and at times, insensitive to his subjects. I didn't care for it."
5,parent and child,"I picked this book up in Philadelphia at the ariport while waiting to change planes. This was not my normal thing to do because of the exorbitant prices in air port book stores, but the title and jacket intriqued me. I couldn't put the book down, even while sitting at home. The stories are very ""touchable"" and encouraging. As a single mom of 4 adult children and 2 grandchildren I have had my share of issues, and I can be ""self focused"". But this book said to me ""don't stop dreaming"", ""don't lose focus"". If others can go on with thier lives after problems bigger than mine, I can too. If others can write with compassion and understanding ....and clearly...I can too. I'm glad I picked it up even if the price at the air port was a bit steep."
5,A conversation...,"I had the opportunity to get to know Po Bronson in between the promotion of ""What Should I Do With My Life"" and the writing of ""Why Do I Love These People"". During this time Po provided me with glimpses of what he was researching and developing. When I read the book I felt as though each story was like a conversation. All of us has a story with good times, bad times and the times in between. And in each story others can see a part of themselves that maybe just isn't as unique as we would like it to be. For me the strength of this book is in the way many, some or all of these stories can provoke us to look at our families, our friends, ourselves through a different perspective. It is a book to be shared."
4,Real Stories About Real People Experiencing Real Things,"Provocative, compelling, enlightening stories of human beings grappling with what they want--and don't--from their families beyond shared genes, history and memories. While Bronson's ""narrative"" sometimes get in the way of the stories he's telling, this remains a gem of a book that hasn't received nearly the attention that it deserves."
1,"New York Times and Guardian UK, right on!","Po' Po. The above reviews say it all. They, like many of us, see through the desperate needs of the narcissistic author using others' personal stories as his stage. There is nothing sincere about Po Bronson. Save your money and buy something from Dr. Phil."
1,Captain Kangaroo writes about family! Bleccch!,"[...]As for my review of the book, it was given to me by my sister who thought I would have a great laugh over it, as she knows I can't stand these Gen-X overbearing Daddy-love guys. Like, excuse me, but just because you decided to give parenthood a whirl you are now an expert on LOVE?The book is patchy at best, there is no through -line and it so last year's Oprah that I couldn't believe that anyone could have possibly given it a good review. My guess is loving family members and friends of his - because this is just huggy-lovey-touchy-feely sugar-coated hop up the kids on Froot Loops garbage.I DO NOT recommend it unless you are not getting enough SUGAR in your diet or if you are really interested in seeing a cutting-edge author turn into Captain Kangaroo."
1,My story.,"Mine is one of the stories in the book. When Po sent it to me, I was eager to read it because I expected it to be handled in a sensitive manner while telling an important story. I was wrong.I felt violated - not because I was expecting a rosey spin on my story but because Po violated some important things we had discussed. He told me he wasn't sure what angle he would take on the story but that he would most certainly run it past me. Wrong again. I considered him a friend and shared with him a photograph of my children. Imagine my surprise when I found it published in the book WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.I have not read the other stories in the book. It has been months and I have not been able to get past being used in this way.If my story has helped anyone, it has been at a very high cost to me...one that I did not agree to pay."
2,Blah,"I had to order this book for a class. There is nothing in it that makes it worth $135. I kept waiting for the life-changing information, but it just wasn't there. It is not worth keeping. Rent or borrow if you can"
3,"A bit flimsy, but gets the job done",It looks pretty sweet. I wasn't aware that it was just a hollow case. No zips or nothing and the edges of the PSP are not protected. You have to screw the tops in to fit the PSP in. DON'T OVER SCREW THE TOPS. I already stripped one of the threads.
4,An Enduring Tale,"John Lloyd Stephens recounting of his travels in Central America continues to fascinate -- even after 170 years. As one of the first modern explorers of the area and it's significant Mayan ruins, his stories provide an insightful and entertaining look into the tumultuous times of the mid 1800's in that locale. Catherwood's detailed illustrations give visual support to the magic and mystery of their discoveries. This book is a must for the affcionado of Central America, of Maya history or of valiant explorers who came not to conquer but to discover."
5,One of my favorite books. . . abridged.,"Imagine this storyline: It's the early 19th century. An IndianaJones kind of antiquarian (archeologist) is off to Central America toseek lost cities in the jungle. Meanwhile, the U.S. government is in a quandary because its newly appointed minister (ambassador) to the Republic of Central America has suddenly died. So, they offer the job to the archeologist - hey, he's already headed that way, right? - who accepts. Then, to make things even more complicated, it turns out that the Republic is in the throes of civil war, an historic upheaval which will determine the political divisions that are with us still, a century and a half later. Thus goes the basic story of ""Incidents."" This particular edition is somewhat disappointing in that it has been abridged from the original, and most of the intricately detailed Catherwood drawings have been left out. It makes up for this with some marvelous photography, most of it from the 1860s-70s timeframe."
5,"Historically great,and illustrations awesome!","I have read and possess all of ""incidents..."" books by Stephens. Each set is terrific. I read them over and over. I only wish I had at least ONE of Catherwood's colored illustrations! Each book is written as a novel, and one doesn't want to put it down, it is so good."
5,"Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan, Vol....",I can't say enough about the Incidents of Travel journals of John L. Stephens. This particular edition is a fairly good reproduction of the artwork of Mr. Frederick Catherwood. It's worth having in anyone's collection!
2,Poor mix,"There is no climatic piece in the whole album. It appears it was gathered selections...by that I mean, somebody said ""oh let's use this one and this one..."" The selections just drift from one to the next and carry little emotional impact on this listener. Yet I love Angela, but Roberto is second rate. Overall, not much on here to remember."
4,MASTER OF DISASTER,"Populous is a great game I control all of my people as I wanted, there alot of great spell I can destroy the enemy.The graphic is pretty good too also the music is very relaxing,Populous well take a month to finish the game because you need alots of men to gather together and make them fight another enemy and also worship the totem pole or what ever it's call to release the spell.It's cool went I destroy there town,my favorite spell to destroy the enemy are Volcano,Lightning,metero shower and the flying dragon,those spell well make it easy too kill them.So It fun and is my favorite game,""I'm still playing Populous today"".END"
4,Pretty good stuff.,"O.K., so maybe it's not the best game around. But it certainly worth the few dollars it costs these days (the intro movie alone's pretty cool). Become the shaman of your tribe and build, magic and war your tribe unto total dominance. Hey it kept me ocupied, for a hundred hrs or so."
1,"Populous, a horrible spin on a good idea","I bought this game thinking it would be much like the old one. With a range of spells the molded the landscape, and relativly little control over your people. How wrong I was.The game took advantage of the booming RTS trend. All the spells you can cast are now only usable through a unit in the game that is called a shaman. And your following are no more then pesants. If they need a house, you have to tell them to build one. Otherwise they stand around waiting. If you need a warrior, tell them to build a barracks, then order a couple pesants to train. All in all, the game amounts to an RTS with ONE military unit and then some guy who can cast spells. Imagine Warcraft with only footman, and you have Populous."
2,Not for me,"This was one of the worst games that I've ever played. The graphics were alright, but the game itself was bad. I mostly play games where you conquer,rule and build cites. Populous did let you build things - the options were very limited. The pleges weren't anything to get excited about either. Say for instance you were to do the plege with all the lochus-it looked so fake, it was as if a small tiny cloud was flying by. The tribe people practicly don't do anything. When you did let your people attack another tribe, there hardly was any action. When I bought this game, I expected it to be really good. Once I actually played it I wanted to return it."
1,Ever played this game?,"Well, don't! I can't tell you just how horrible it is. First of all, you are not an all powerful entity. The graphics are slick, but sometimes choppy. Things that die also have the tendency of blocking the screen. The spells you can cast ... . You must ""worship"" totem poles to gain these spells. They take forever to get and are extremely limited in range or power. There are few things interesting. There are only five units is this game, and most of them are illogical. Take my word. Dont buy."
3,Really cool,"This game is a really good buy. Not only do you get to build villiages but you get to destroy your enemies by eroding the land under them and watching them run around like idiots when you cast a spell that involves a swarm of bees. Plus there are a full 20 levels of this. Just to give you a sense of how much these people thought of you can control a warrior that shoots fireballs out of his hands, a freaky lady wearing a mask called the shaman that can cast spells from lightning bolts to conjuring up a flying dragon that eats up people then spits them back out again. If you like the age of empires series then you will probably like this game just as much."
5,I love it,"This is such a great game and one of my favorite ones. The graphics are OK, but I don't care how good or bad they are. You are the shaman and you have to take over other tribes to become the most powerful shaman. The first level is so easy because the other tribe won't attack your settlement, but they will on the on the other levels. I'm not exactly sure about these things because I only have a demo version that was on my Simcity 3000, but if the demo is so good then the actual game has to be better. I saw a lot of spells and stuff that were not available on demo version and they looked pretty cool. You can also turn your braves into warriors, priests, firewarriors and more. Some of the spells are the lightening, the landbridge, the earthquake, the tornado, the magical shield, the swamp, the swarm, and more. Buy this."
4,"A time tested, addictive and VERY fun game for even dated macines.","Based loosley on populous II, Populous the beginning has got to be the best game I have played in a long time. It may be dated (1998) but you will be incredibly surprised. The game is in full 3-D, with the exception of the shaman(your character) and your folowers, which are sprites. My only gripe is the lack of a random map to play on, as in the game it is only the campaign that you play. And even bottom line computers can play this game in full detail level. It still is a very fun and challenging game for almost everybody."
4,Conquer the Planatery System with a Shaman,"This is a build & conquer game, but one in which conquest often requires solving a unique challenge. There are fewer routes to greatness than in a game like Sim City or Civilization. The nature of the challenges & the limited number of resources keep the number of options reasonable.Populous resides in the genre somewhere between arcade games and strategy games. Unlike Civilization and Alpha Centauri, events happen in real-time; there are no turns. Step away from the computer to take a phone call and you can find your team quickly eliminated.The graphics are OK, and the game is efficient enough to run on even a 200 MHz Cyrix, if you turn the music off and run on a small screen. It's an interesting game, some of the challenges can be quite puzzling, but I don't find it as addicting as Alpha Centauri.(If you've enjoyed this review, please leave positive feedback. Click the ""about me"" link to read my other Amazon reviews. Thanks!)"
1,Nullissimo!!!,"How can one compare this ""singer"" to Mado Robin (the highest voice), Mady Mesple (one of the best living coloraturas) or to the wonderful and unique Lily Pons?! This pretentious singer is good enough to play at Madonna's parties. Tasteless, amateurish. Those who have ears should avoid this hoax (sings only in playback by the way). Exit."
3,paraplegics given short shrift,"I tried to give this idea a chance, faith healing rock band, and with such a great cast was impressed at the get go.... I followed the script down a rabbit hole and found it engaging but somewhere lost my interest as many elements fell apart... Truthfully I started my doubts when $1500/mo living expenses were not enough on Skid Row.... r ya kidding me??? that's a freakin mortgage payment, no roomates or favors from the healed????... so started to pick apart the overacting by Orlando, Laura, and Julia, so unworthy performances although Orlando needs a serious vehicle for this type of acting... he was incredible but in the wrong time zone... the basic premise is: Do you know your place? I never thought that was the right question and faltered miserably in the answer. Mark should do well when he trusts his own instincts more vs his dear friends."
1,I'll never trust amazon reviews again.,Am I the first to have the cowhindas to to tell the truth. Every review on here has to be from someone affiliated with the film.it is a total piece of slow crap. Should pay me $25 to watch.
1,Amateurish at Best,"I ordered this item a few weeks ago. When it arrived I wasextremely disappointed in it. The sound quality was amateurish at bestand at times the author/reader sounded like he was spitting into themicrophone. Additionally the suggestions encompassed on the CD andaccompanying CD insert (keep a food journal/set action goals) were notunique or new, and did require sacrifice and willpower despite thetitle's claim to the contrary. Based on the sound quality, exorbitantprice and banal content I do not recommend it."
4,It Works!,"I really enjoy listening to this, and it is working! At first I had problems finding time to listen to it - I had to put my mind to it and MAKE time, just as with anything else in life. I love the way I feel after listening to the CD, and the weight is coming off."
4,Thymes bath salts,I love this product and it arrived promptly and in good shape. I gave as a wedding shower gift wrapped in bath towels. It was a great gift!
5,The Best Music Ever!,"Zurich's musical masterpiece works on all levels, primarily due to the incredibly organic drum grooves. I would recommend this cd to anyone who want to feel the beats flow through them."
5,Classic Skating Know How,"Great resource for skaters of all levels. Obviously dated material, but still relevant to the basics of our sport. As a coach, I find this book to be helpful and insightful into my daily teaching."
2,"Get 40,000 words","The author published an updated version of this book called 40,000 selected words. Get that title - it is fabulous!"
3,Burns my eyes!,I love most all Neutrogena products but I have to say that I don't really like this one at all. It makes my skin look greasy and it burns my eyes!
2,maybe its some other reason,"The skin at the outer area of my eye is inflamed - can't find anything on the net to explain it - Plan to see dermo asap. But I am through with AHA products . Never thought I had sensitive skin but as I age I find I prefer to be comfortable as opposed to younger looking if those are only 2 options -do not like pain and redness near my eyes - also my eylids feel like there are needles, albiet lightly poking them. I didn't use the product there but assume it made it's way there due to gravity. So if you are over 55 and find any irritation , I say ,toss it. The regular non AHA nutrogena is better for moisturizing."
3,"Okay, but a little heavy feeling","This is a perfectly nice SPF moisturizer, but for me it felt a little heavy on my skin (which tends toward oily anyway). It almost felt more like sunblock than moisturizer. The pump bottle is handy, and I have no complaints with the SPF. After using this I went back to Olay with SPF, which feels much lighter and more natural to me."
2,Don't trust your home's security to this flaky piece of trash,"Skylink's GT-100 slowly but steadily failed in less than 18 months. It sporadically would ""freeze up"" and not do it's job, not even responding to the physical button press-much less the autoclose function it is designed for. There was no way to tell when it was on the fritz, negating the peace of mind I purchased it for.Response from Skylink was equally disappointing. After an initially encouraging contact that promised a replacement if I first tried reprogram the sensor, further communication was met with canned email responses that did not answer my questions.It should also be noted that this system is wireless, so there is an ugly wire antenna that protrudes from the button unit (not shown in the picture!) and the sensor unit is BATTERY powered, another point of failure. Don't bother with Skylink or the GT-100, I wish that I had not."
2,Works well until it fails,I bought the GT-100A door closer along with the open/close status monitor in December of 2009. I installed it myself and everything was great until January 2011 when the door stopped closing automatically. It seems the timer has failed a month after the warranty ran out. Poor quality product in my opinion. The documentation is not very clear on how to troubleshoot this issue so I unplugged power to the garage door closer and started from scratch to confirm that the unit has experienced a failure.
