2,A let down,"I don't know what Ms. Berry was thinking, but this book was a big let down. I could not understand the significance of the voodoo and the Christianity. This book raised so many questions, but left me with no answers.I don't think Ms. Berry did enough research on the two subjects to tackle such a novel. I don't think she did a good job of answering the whos, whats, whens, wheres, and hows in this book.The sadist part of it all is that I still don't know what 'Colored Sugar Water"" meant in this book."
4,good quality but huge,"This is a really nice wet suit with 3mm neoprene, thicker than most of the kids wetsuits. My daughter has outgrown a 2mm shorty suit and in that one she is cold within 30 min even in a warm pool. But the Konfidence XS is huge. 3T clothing fits her just right at this point and the XS crotch is at her knees. Too huge for her to wear."
5,Great!!!,"I've become an anime enthusiast no more than five months ago. Here is a list of what I've seen: Ninja Scroll (series and movie); Samurai Champloo; Mononoke - Spirited Away - Howl's Moving Castle; the entire Kenshin Himura series, OVA and Movie; and Shura no Toki. I also watched the old Samurai series about Musashi Miyamoto. I have to say that Shura no Toki is in the same league as all the above mentioned except the three Miyazaki movies.The story revolves around generations of fighters who practice the ""mutsu-emmei"" style. These fighters go at it bare handed without any weapons except for their bodies and still manage to kick serious butt. The story, besides having nice character development, great actions sequences and even love stories, manages to deliver the plot with great historical references and settings. I would say that if you liked Samurai Champloo and the Kenshin series, you will definitely enjoy Shura no Toki."
4,A World Without Heroes,"Powerless is a Marvel book that takes the idea of Marvel Heroes of Spiderman, Daredevil and Wolverine to another level.Reprinting the six issue mini series Powerless, writers Matt Cherniss and Peter Johnson redefines the Marvel Super Heroes without super powers. Told through the viewpoint of phchiatrist Mr Watts who observers these three as a Watcher.In the text, you will notice other heroes and villians of the Marvel Universe without costumes nor trappings.An interest piece to read for those adults with a brain to think outside the boxBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
1,Not Compatible,"I purchased this cartridge for an Epson C88+ and it was apparently not compatible. It fit in the printer just fine, but the printer acted as if it wasn't present. It could have been my setup, though."
2,"Crazy, not merely Off Balance","I enjoyed the characters, the descriptions of Scotland and the upper crust country life, and the dialogue. The premise disturbed me, thus the lower rating. It is apparent from the moment Lorna enters the picture that she is determined to wedge herself in between her sister, Isobel, and her sister's husband, Giles. ""Why let her stay?"" is my question. If someone is endangering your marriage and upsetting your children, why allow them to remain among you?"
2,Of Balance Off my reading list,"I did not like this book because the words are very hard to understand and the plot was not at all making sense to me. It was confusing and the names had too much thinking involved for reading a book. Also to find out the true meaning of the plot you must read the pages over and over, and at that rate I could be done with 2 other books.This book seems to be interesting but actually understand this book you have to have patience I found out that the meaning of ""Do Not Judge a book by it's cover"" really meant.I do like one part in the book though. The part that I enjoyed was when one of the aunts came home and explained how she was sorry for being late. I liked this part because it was very simple and understandable. The rest of the story was just a blur."
5,Way Out There!,"Contemporary parapsychology has tended to become rather anemic in its search for scientific respectability, studying tiny statistical effects in an oh so very rigorous fashion. That has its place, but we tend to forget that the laboratory study only exists because dramatic and important and inexplicable events happen in real life that remind us there's something important to try to understand - like the question of whether the mind survives death!Pilkington's book gives the full story of Dr. Bindelof, an apparent spirit who changed the lives of several teenage boys through seance manifestations. One of those boys was Montague Ullman, a psychiatrist who spearheaded research into telepathic dreams decades later. It's a fascinating story, and a frustrating one - frustrating because we devote almost no energy and resources to thoroughly investigating paranormal phenomena. A good read!"
2,For business/management people w/o any technical background,"I am an e-commerce architect mainly dealing with technical part of the e-commerce rather than the business side of it. I heard good things about the authors' class (I belive it is a lot more technical) that is being taught at the SMU in Dallas so I decided to pick up the book thinking it will save me from attending a $5,000 class.Well, this book is not for those people with technical backgrounds but for those management/business people who doesn't understand the basic concept of what it needs to run succesful e-commerce web sites. If you fit in that category it should be a worthwhile reading I belive. It will give you a good general background info.I would say this is still better than the most e-commerce books I've read but still not good enough. If you are an engineer/programmer/analyst, then don't bother too much with this book."
1,A truly awful book,"I reviewed about 20 e-commerce books in preparation for teaching a series of corporate seminars and college courses, and this was easily the weakest of the bunch. The authors must have written this in a weekend. There was very little depth to this treatment - most of it was terribly obvious. No exploration of the more fundamental ways in which e-commerce is changing organization and design of businesses, supply chains, the marketing relationship, etc. These people need to go back to the field to find out what is really happening, not just hang out in their ivory tower. I suggest spending your $$ on one of Ravi Kalakota's books, which are much more thoughtful and original. Were not the market for e-commerce books exploding, this very weak book would never have been published."
4,Is it enough for building the e-empire?,"As an IT professional, I was a bit (just a bit) disappointed with the content of book. The authors have done a very good job in including almost all points that need to be looked into in an e-commerce environment, but as in all ""all-in-one"" books, some areas, especially those that fall into the realm of business strategy, are left weak. Even in the first four chapters, where e-commerce strategies and approaches are set out, I felt an inclination towards the technical side of e-commerce. However, the book is very successful in conveying different architectures, together with the pros and cons, to the reader who has the basic knowledge about internet technology. I believe that this is not enough to ""build the e-empire"", but the book has enough potential to act as an infrastructural guide and a reference for e-commerce deployment projects, especially for project managers and executives."
1,Not what I E-Xpected,"I had hoped that this book would provide me with insights and techniques I did not already know. I am a technology professional but have not focused on e-commerce to date. I did not really learn anything new; readers of some of the trade rags (CIO, InformationWeek, Red Herring, Industry Standard, etc) will probably not benefit from the book. I will concede the difficulty of writing a book in a rapidly changing environment, but it was still too general to be of much use."
5,This is an excellent look at E-commerce. I am very impressed,"Whether you are an accomplished E-Commerce Architect or just learning, this book is a must. I am taking Steffano's and Juanita's E-Commerce Architect Certification course at Southern Methodist University (SMU) and I feel confident that through their personal instruction I am positioned for next year's growth."
4,"All-in-one, without one","This is a very good all-in-one approach, but it lacks some important information on strategy and change."
3,Fun to read,"The book is fun to read and contains interesting research materials. I particularly like the company profile section which highlights some successful e-commerce examples world wide. Other than that, much of the content will quickly become obsolete because of the super fast change that occured in the industry. Most materials will probably carry the same weight if gathered from recent magazine articles."
1,Very disappointing...,"Huge mistake, I bought this book before reading any review about it. I thought the mistakes and issues people were talking about regarding the 1st version would have been fixed in this 2nd edition. Well, I guess this 2nd is as bad as the 1st one. Anyway, it's about all the aspects of e-commerce but really really really lacks any kind of depth. It's 100% superficial, pure common-sense and is honestly, indeed, a waste of money. I could have said there are quite a lot of useful links, but when you see they still refer to USweb/CKS, that became marchfirst maybe 2 years ago, and that actually went bust a few months ago... forget it! And one more critic: it sounds like Steffano and Juanita have some problem with their ego... really, forget this book..."
2,A Pretty Basic and Simplistic Study,"I bought this book because most of you loved it; i was disappointed; its analysis of marketing was very weak - sort of like a junior high school student's report on ""the internet."" - and often its info was shallow or just wrong! Banner ads, contrary to the book's assertion, are *not* a great way to market your web site - according to almost all recent, intelligent analysis."
5,Great book and simple for the non-techie,I bought and love this book because it is written in a simple easy-to-read fashion. I am in marketing and instantly felt more well versed in the E-World. I recommend highly to anyone interested in getting started in the world of E-commerce in a non intimidating way.I suggested the book to several family members and friends who have also raved about it.
3,medicore,"The First Sacrifice was a loaner from a relative who thought I'd love the setting of the book - Berlin, a city near and dear to my heart. And for me, it was the best part of the book - his descriptions of the city, its layout and familar haunts made me ""homesick.""The plot, on the otherhand, left much to be desired. This may be a function of me reading the sequel without having read the previous story - there are allusions to events that happened ""earlier"", but it didn't seem to make a huge difference to me. Essentially the story deals with the resurgence of a 4th Reich in the newly re-united Germany, with plenty of intrigue, twists, and double-dealing characters. Similar to a Le Carre or Ludlum book, but not nearly as well written or as tight.The book would make for a decent airplane read, short of that, not recommended."
4,Still a valuable reference,"I am a Product Designer with 30 years experience designing consumer electronics. This book is an excellent reference guide to what issues and concerns should be investigated and addressed in developing handheld products. The only minor complaint I have is that owing to its 2002 publication date, some of the devices used as examples are so outdated that many readers have probably had no hands-on interaction with them. However the principles and methods discussed are still very relevant and useful."
1,Too bad,Don't buy this book.I cannot find any usabiltiy testing technique in this book. Just explain what PDA and Palms are and all thing we already knew. Alsom appendix is too long.I don't want to know Palm history. Why author explain detail about each funtion of Palm or PDA?Save your money!
4,Good design resource,This book is one of the first serious works about usability for handhelds. Explanations are accompanied with interesting examples collected from the renowned author's experience in the field. I find it a valuable reference book for University students of HCI. It is also a very useful guide for usability professionals.
4,chrissy's right,"I've seen Radiostar play around the Baltimore/Washington area and they're very good. Radiostar's debut cd should be out soon. They use to be ""Honor Among Thieves"". Check out their cd from a couple of years ago called ""Grow""."
3,"Good, not great","Finally decided to order some new tv trays but did not want to spend an arm and a leg. These units work pretty well, they are not pretty and due to some banging during shipping the black paint gets a little scuffed up.They assembled pretty well but make no mistake these are budget items."
4,You get what you pay for...,"I am giving this four stars because it is a good value but keep in mind that you get what you pay for. I have owned this set for about a month and the tables have held up just fine but the stand cracked when I was putting it together. I will probably upgrade when this set ""dies"" but for now they are quite functional and certainly good for the price."
5,Great Deal!,"After looking high and low for TV serving trays, I found these offered through Amazon. I needed extra room for company on Christmas Eve and everything I looked at was too expensive...even ebay's offerings were difficult to secure because the bidding process was uncertain and I needed to make sure I had the trays before Christmas.Not only did I get these TV trays in time for Christmas (despite short notice), they were very reasonably priced and easy to pull out of the box and set up. They had some marred places on two of them, but that was more than likely due to the packing and shipping process, which wasn't a problem. The finish is a satin black and they are sturdy.I would recommend this product and would not hesitate to order them again..Yea Amazon and it's partners!"
4,good buy,Sometimes hard to find black tv trays so I ordered these. So far so good. just what I was looking for.
4,The King of Swing,"Anything by Artie Shaw is well worth listening to. This CD is no exception. Sadly, although sixteen (16) tracks are listed, there are only fifteen (15) as the first - Begin the Beguine - is missing. Even so I have decided not to return Star Dust as the others almost make up for the missing tune."
5,5.0.1,"The CD says ""copy protected"" but if you use the newest version od itunes 5.0.1 it will rip it to your hard drive."
1,Copy Protected CD,"I bought this piece of garbage and attempted to rip the songs to mp3 format. No dice. At the bottom of the back cover it says in tiny 8 point print: Copy protected CD. PC Compatibility Requires Windows Media Player 7.1 or above. Will not play on Mac.Amazon is erroneously labeling this a an Audio Compact Disc. This is not true. Phillips (the creator of the Audio CD standard) does not allow copy protected discs to be labeled as Audio CDs.I will be returning the disc, and avoiding all RottenRecords releases from now on,"
1,what the...,"Goatwhore ? The only people who will apreciate this are strictly nu-metal kids who think they know about blackmetal but have no clue. I admit, im not a blackmetal fan but i do enjoy the music of mayhem,cradel of filth,dark funeral&, god dethroned,&,emperor but thats about it! Anyways,goatwhore is lame and a bunch of talentless posers so stay away from this if you like good & talented music."
3,"Very Fun , but don't expect too much more.","Very simple gameplay and setup surounds this wrestling game from the classic TG 16 system . Lots of good fun , but don't expect to much more , other than that. The graphic's are so / so , and the sound is okay. But if your looking for sophistication , your not going to find it. This is not Turbo Graphic's 16's most impressive game , so if your looking for only that reason , may I suggest Ninja Spirit , SideArms , Bloody Wolf or Bonk's Adventure. [...]Summary: Graphic's - standard / sound effects - standard / very simple setup & gameplay / appropiate for the enitire family"
5,When Less Is More...,"""Enchiridion"" is a compound word from the Greek, meaning roughly ""something you can hold in your own hand."" In this case the ""something"" is a modern, well-organised and easy-to-use reference for New Testament Greek. Such a work necessarily leaves much out in order to remain small and manageable, but NT exegetes are unlikely to have only this book in their arsenal of interpretation.I know of no other work whose author has done such a good job of separating the ""must-have"" from ""nice-to-have"" information. All examples are from the New Testament. One of those rare reference books that one can have with him much of the time instead of having it on a shelf! Even though I have A. T. Robertson et al. available, I use this little book regularly."
5,auto shade,i should have purchased this product a long time ago. works great! a snap to install! will purchase for my other cars.AAAAAAA+++++++
3,Beware shipping etc. charges if not from USA,"The product seems OK so far, but a quick note of caution if you are a UK customer who is on '.com' instead of '.co.uk' by mistake, and doesn't look closely at the shipping charge. I think this product misses out on free shipping by 1 cent, and as a result I ended up with a shipping charge of $35.98 + $9.15 import duties, which makes this appalling value!Caveat emptor of course, and I should have looked closer, but I'm sure others will make the same mistake and so forewarned is...Of course Amazon / Berlitz could also flag up an ""are you sure"" warning prior to non-US purchases like mine, given the charges incurred. Would be good practice in respect of customer service"
4,Not to bad,"This is not the original Grand Funk band. Mark Farner is the only member from Grand Funk and does a few of the Grand Funk's hits from the past. This is an outdoor concert that probably featured other bands before and after Mark Farner. It is a so, so concert. Video and sound quality are good."
4,Cheap Frills Worth The Purchase,"This book is a look at the lighter side of updating, embellishing and creating new wardrobe pieces. There's a good mix of projects (everything from jazzing up an old pair of pumps to crafting a simple dress from scratch)and the instructions are simple and straight forward.While the majority of ideas in this book aren't suited for ""grown-ups"" the creative inspiration and basic techniques make this book an entertainging and worthy resource.I borrowed this book from the library twice and made several dresses before finally shelling out the bucks to buy and it's earned a promenant place on my craft table."
2,For young and inexperienced,"I didn't care for this book at all. I have design and sewing experience and always looking for innovative ways with clothing. This book was totally useless for me. I thought the designs were juvenile and simplistic and aimed at teens or early 20's. The drawing style was cute but used way too much, it would have been much better to see photos of the designs. I gave this book to someone who would appreciate it... a 14 year old."
2,Wrong item,The service was fast and pricing was good BUT it does not fit my car a 76 Cadllac eldorado!
5,Excellent Transaction!!!,"Transaction was great!!!!!...product arrived in great time, sooner than expected...the condition of the the product was excellent...this is a X-mas gift for my dad...but the sample tracks seemed wonderful..."
3,good music but smashed case,The music is great but they must have known the case was crushed before they shipped it cause the shipping box was not crushed .
5,Love Jerry Baker,I love all Jerry Baker's books. The favorite in my family is the one that talks about grocery items. It has gardening tips in it too but my father (to whom I gave it last year at Christmas) goes on and on about little cleaning tips and tricks all the time. That book has made the rounds in his neighborhood and he has decided not to lend it out anymore because people don't want to give it back!
4,Excellent for gardeners,"My mom asked me for this book as a gift, she loves it and is an avid gardener. Would make a great gift for the people in your life who love gardening! Easy read as well."
3,Had to send back,"I liked this book, but it was more for the outdoor critters. I was in need of kitchen critters who think they own the house.I'm sending it back, & will try to find something that will work indoors. ""Ask the Bugman"" will be my next purchase."
4,Keep your garden healthy,This book contains a lot of information that helps to keep your lawn and garden healthy. Most problems can be solved by using formulas contained in this book rather than comercial products that are expensive and confusing.
3,Ok as regular clip board,"This clip board is built pretty well and tightly holds a small stack of papers. The clock on it broke within one week (the first number in the hours slot stopped working so 11:00 looks like1:00). The information printed on it may be helpful for a nursing student but pretty much useless for a practitioner. I wanted to like this clipboard but for the price, it was a disappointment."
3,We'll See...,"Very disappointed when my niece, who just graduated nursing college, opened this for Christmas and it didn't work! I was heartbroken. Thought maybe it was just a bad battery that came in it, so searched everywhere for the right-size battery and could not find one anywhere. Had to order batteries from Amazon, when they came, the clipboard still didn't work. Returned it and ordered another one because it received such good reviews, figured the first one must have been a dud. The second one works perfectly so far, but time will tell if this is really a quality product!"
2,Horrible!!!,"This book was way to grown up for a young girl, i'd say it is for ages 14 and up. it was not very apropriat and it just was not exciding."
2,Rerecording Alert!!,"If any Country artist deserves a 2CD career compilation its John Anderson. His Warner Brothers material is crying out for a decent overview. So, this looked like a winner on paper. The hits plus album tracks from his 20+ career on Warner and BNA. But, this CD released on Anderson's own label is nothing but remakes. You won't know this if you looked at the sticker on the CD cover. It's not listed there, but if you look real close, at the bottom of the CD- in small letters - it states that these are new recordings. Too bad. A missed opportunity that only the most die-hard of Anderson's fans will want for their collection. The rest should stick with the Warner and BNA Greatest Hits CD's."
1,Disappointed in the re-make,I wish I had read some other buyer reviews before buying this! I thought it would be original recordings. It just doesn't do it for me - I'm going to resell it and buy the original recordings!
2,Remakes!,"Despite the fact that these songs are misleadingly placed in chronological order, they are all new recordings. This is not a multi-label retrospective as it leads the buyer to believe. You'll have to go elsewhere for the original recordings."
3,"All the hits, but not the originals","John Anderson did a real nice job rerecording his hits. The sound of the album is clean, the musicians are top notch, and Anderson himself is in fine voice. Just be aware, these are not the original recordings that you may remember from the radio. A new take on some great material."
5,A great musician.,He is so talented and can sing a variety of tunes. A unique voice.We need more singers like him!
4,Funny Adventure,"I'm Ceci. I gave this book four stars because it was very funny,mysterious, and it made me keep on reading. I didn't give this book five stars because the ending doesn't really answer some questions in the book. Some parts of it made me laugh until milk came out of my nose. Kids: DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!!...Altho you SHOULD probably buy it."
5,marvin redpost is he a girl. Is one of the best books ever.,"were do I start. Marvin is a great book. When I was reading it I felt like I was watching a great film.My favorite charector is General Jackson.It realy made me think about how other kids feel when they get teased.It is a short chapter book but when your reading it, it makes it seem a long time Louise sachar does not leave any details out."
4,Marvin Repost Is He a Girl,"I liked Marvin Redpost because it was funny . The reason it is funny to me because he kept trying to kiss his elbow. He almost got caught kissing his elbow. He started to act like a girl . He was wondering why girls giggle when they come out of the bathroom. He liked the way girls did thiings with their hair. He started to bite his finger like a girl in his classroom. He said that girls are lucky because they can wear anything they want like shorts, skirts and dresses and get to get boys in trouble more than boys get girls in trouble. My favorite part was when he tried to kiss his elbow and got tangled up in his sheets."
4,Good book,"Marivin is so weird.So, so,SO weird!He tries to kiss___(not telling!)You want to hear what he kisses?You find outif you want to!Raed the book! You don't have to like it but I sure did!Marvin fell off the ___.(again!)That is all I'm going to tell you!"
1,Seriously Disturbing,"Unlike the other individuals who reviewed this book, I did not find it funny or suspensful. I found it seriously disturbing. To think that some people find this appropriate for grade school children is shocking. The language the characters use is totally disrespectful. The overall theme of the book is obvious from the title and is essentially gender and sexual issue related. The sub theme is that girsl are better than boys. Parents should be on the look out for this type of material in their public schools. That's where I found this book by accident in my 2nd graders class. This is yet another example of people with an agenda trying to condition our kids from the earliest ages on when they are not ready to comprehend these types of concepts"
1,Wrong message for children,"This book is inappropriate for grade schoolers. It has the undertone that gay is okay, that girls are better than boys, and using disrespectful language is the norm. While sitting together in the bathroom, Marvin's sister tells him how much fun it will be when he gets to be a girl... they can tie ribbons in their hair, etc. Keep you boys and girls away from this book (and likely away from the author)."
3,Taylor needs more acting lessons:},"So this movie was entertaining enough that we didn't turn it off but something I wished I would have picked something else instead. Taylor could not do a movie where he is front and center. The whole teen aspect was just off, there is no way this kid could have successfully run from these two guys, the romance and action that happened belonged in a Mission Impossible movie not a teen flick. This movie just didn't pull it off. But hey it wasn't so bad I turned it off I did want to see how it all ended.Sex- Some making out between teens-heavy kissing with no clothes removed.Violence-Lots of deaths- lots of shooting parents, cops, bad guys. Bad guys beats up teen girl, main character beats up and kills bad guy twice. Explosions, chases.Language- Some no F word."
3,Started off bad and then was okay,"This started out as another really bad teen movie, but then it got exciting enough for me to finish watching it. By the end of it I was wondering why on earth would Sigourney Weaver, Dermot Mulroney and Alfred Molina stoop to this level. They gave the best performances in the entire film and were only in it for a sliver. Did their agents say, ""It's a small part and a vehicle for Taylor Lautner."" Huh. That's pretty sad that in order for great actors to keep working they have to attach themselves to movies where bad actors are carrying the film. Taylor Lautner was acceptable, but the guy has zero range and believability. This movie proves that the only reason he was lucky enough to get a movie like this is only for his looks which will fade and then so will his career. I don't even know who the girl was who was equally bad. It was the plot that was exciting and interesting that it kept me pasted and made this movie okay."
2,Good Movie for Team Jacob,This ain't no academy award winner. This ain't Twilight. This ain't Lava Girl and Shark Boy. This ain't good either. This just plain old sucks!
3,Ugh...,"I was really hoping this was the movie 2 help lautner out of the twilight saga but sadly it wasn't. First off, it's a movie we've seen before and done WAY better. His co star really makes me angry because she's just horrible. The script could've been worked on just a bit more. Some parts were good (when he wasn't with lily Collins) and scene with his parents. And the most impotant part is: WHO GOT ABDUCTED?! Talk about misleading. I love Taylor 2 bits but if he wants 2 have a working production company and acting career, he has 2 look @ what he's getting into. I hope his next non twilight movies won't disappoint. Looking for action scenes only this might be your movie."
2,Exactly as expected.,"I was bored and wanted to rent a movie. I viewed Abduction. It was semi entertaining, but very predictable and corny."
5,Abduction,"This movie was awesome. It had action, suspense and it was not full of unnecessary sex. This is the kind of movies I love to watch."
3,Decent story with good action,"Great display of Taylor Lautner's ability. Not a bad movie. Some good action, but movie could have been better. Worth watching once."
2,WTH did I just watch,"I was looking forward to this movie and actually surprised that it skipped the theater and went to DVD and download. The acting was really bad, and the fighting scenes reminded me of Mr and Mrs Smith (another horrible action movie). Even the wrestling scene in the beginning was unrealistic considering they blacked out the background and Nathan was wearing shorts and a t-shirt instead of singlets during a high school wrestling match...talk about bypassing details in a movie. I lost track who was the good guys and who was bad and couldn't wait for this one to end."
1,Fail,This movie abducted 1:46 minutes of my life. Filled with cheesy one liners and many awful action sequences. Sad face.
4,Good Action,Little different than what I expected but it was good The main actors stick to the story and there are a couple twists to keep you interested.
1,cheesy b- action and bad acting.,"first of all i tried to give this a chance i was hoping it was going to be like the bourne series but not even close, im not a fan of him or the twilight movies, but this movie is horrible, the acting especially the main character he was worst than steven seagal and that's saying something, the action is typical b-movieish, the story made absolutely no sense. this could have been a great thriller/action if they had better casting, plot, and director. it seems like they didn't put any thought into this movie at all it's a shame so i wouldn't recommend this mess to any action fan not worth a rent."
1,Just not worth it,"I am so glad I saw this movie for free. I would have asked for a refund if I had to pay to see this in theaters.Bad acting, cliche plot and mediocre action accompanying an immature love scene that hurt to watch."
2,"""Abduction"" is a movie made for one sole purpose, to show off Taylor Lautner.","While he has the look, he can't act and has zero charisma. Just like this movie, so it's a perfect match. The movie is bland, the story is weak, and the action is lame at best. Lautner(Nathan) is a teenager who feels ""different"" on the inside from everyone else. Then one day he comes across a website that shows his picture as a missing child. From there, he is chased by Russian assassins and the CIA. Actually, no one gets abducted in this movie(and its called abduction!). If your a Lautner fan, or a fan of horrible action movies, then this is for you. Otherwise, steer clear of this cause it'll be found in the crap section."
1,pure garbage,"like one reviewer said...""Taylor Lautner can't carry a movie any more than Abigail Breslin can carry a refrigerator."" Save your money."
3,Misses the mark...,May have been meant as a launch vehicle for the young stars... in vain...which is why I marked it as OK
4,Cheap Production with Good Story Line,"An interesting plot, fairly predictable. Not really up to modern production standards, and even less for some of the actors. But it was an enjoyable film."
2,so so,Action was good. Acting was not. Weird plot and emotions weren't realistic. I would skip this one if I had it to do again
2,Abduction Review,"This movie was decent, but not the best. I would not recommend it to people, but appreciate that it was available so I could watch and review it."
2,"Seen it , wasted my time in a bad way.",Please dont waste your time. It starts out good then makes no sense. This fake 007 is cheesey and upsetting
3,Fun to watch,"If you're looking for a real thrilling action movie this isn't it. However, the movie is fun to watch and keeps you going. Sometimes it's predictable but still fun to watch."
4,Okay,The video was cheap and that was good. I doesn't play on my laptop and other movies work fine. It works okay on my computer and tv though.
4,Good story Line.fairly good Acting,"I do not think that the above comments are fair either to the lead actor or the plot.I enjoyed this film very much since it was rooted in reality.Most thriller fans prefer fantastic surreal improbable action and activity. This one was not...and so they were disappointed.Taylor was realistic. He played the role of teenager in the film and he acted with the unsureness and gaucheness of a teenager. His acting as a kid that stumbled on the apparent deceit of those he trusted and love was realistic.I give this film 4 stars because it had a good story to tell,a moral to project ,and the actors were convincing."
2,Definitely nothing special about this movie...,"Just recently rented this movie from Redbox. Wasn't expecting anything terrific, and I got what I expected. Totally unrealistic story, and definitely not anything I'd recommend to anyone. Can a couple of high school kids really make successful escape attempts from both terrorists and the C.I.A.? If your parents were murdered yesterday, would that really set the stage of your heart to begin a romantic relationship today? Does Taylor Lautner really look like a typical high school kid? It's likely your answer to the previous questions will also be the same answer to this question: Will you enjoy this movie? Think about it, then choose. There are many other movies out there that can better occupy your time!"
5,WOW,"This movie surpassed all my expectation. I thought it would be just another teen flick all stupid and silly, but I was wrong. Exciting, intriguing, and different. it stirred my emotions and kept me engrossed. Amazing film !!! Two thumbs up. Watch it."
5,adbudtion a hit at our house,"This movie was suspensful all the way through to the end. Kept you on the edge of your seat, my 12 year olds loved it too."
3,Pretty good with some nice twists.,An action packed movie with a few twists to keep it interesting. I enjoyed watching it and would recommend it if you like action movies.
4,Not bad,"It wasn't ""excellent"" and there was a bit of cornyness to it but all in all it was pretty good and I found myself on edge a little to see what was going to happen next."
3,Pleasantly surprised,"Not bad for Taylor's first after Twi film, Lily and the bestie were believable unsuspecting teens. I thought he showed a lot of leading man qualities, the bounding and leaping were really great. I say good solid job and Taylor has definite action hero qualities--I'm thinking a remake of a classic Shazam!"
2,Forgettable...,"Formulaic with poor acting--I only rented it because I thought it would be engrossing. But it was sort of like a ""made for TV movie"" I can't even remember enough detail to really fully review it."
3,Abduction,"Overall this movie was good. In the beginning, it was slow but it was needed to give the background. The movie, once it picked up, was action packed and exciting."
3,jake??,I thought this mvie kind of dragged. I like Taylor Lautner that's why I purchased it. However it did not meet up to my standards.
2,Dislike,"Truly a bad, poorly acted, predictable mess. I've seen worse, ... I think. How in the world did Sigourney Weaver get involved in this film?!?"
2,the acting!,"By far the worst acting I have ever seen! It was awful! The plot stunk too. I was hoping that Taylor was a better actor than this but, sadly I was disappointed."
3,Movie Time,Abduction was ok...I kept wanting Taylor Lautner to turn into a wolf...but know for the life of me I can't remember too much of the movie. I guess I'll have to watch it again...
3,*** An ok action thriller ***,"I don't really like Taylor Lautner but I liked this movie. I had no expectations though.It's about a teenager who accidentally finds out he is adopted, and then the action starts as he is pursued by criminals who kill his parents and force him to go on the run.I found it an ok action thriller."
4,"Good action thriller, not just for teens","Because of the much hyped vampire movies that Taylor Laughtner is tied to, I almost didn't rent this movie thinking it would be another ""tween"" movie, but I was happily surprised that it was a good action/thriller that keeps your attention from beginning to end. It has a good story, the acting is good and it is well worth the cost of admission. I rented this via download to my tv, but will definitely be adding this to my blu ray collection. This film should cement Taylor's career in the film industry, as he proves that he can carry a film meant for an adult audience. I really liked it and recommend it to people who enjoys a good action/thriller type film."
3,"Nice Action Movie, Dont Overthink it.","The Movie was nice, I almost passed this movie up because of all the opinionated self appointed movie critics, I'd say if you like the Trailer you'll like the Movie."
5,Excellent!!,"Is a good action film very exciting until the end ,adrenalin,humor all in 1 .The Best .Well I think than Taylor is good actor and this short time he show in this movie all of him .....5 star Taylor ."
3,one disc,Hi the only problem i have with this item is that it stated blu-ray plus digital copy but it is only the blu-ray disc that you get and then to get the digital copy you have to go to a website to download it and i find that should not be and my reason is i don't like download movies so in future it would be better to explain that thanks desmond.
3,Fun,"A fun B movie. Who cares if its probable. Cute hero, lots of chases and shoot outs.A popcorn Saturday entertainment."
4,Sweet and action packed!,"I loved this movie. I had tons of action with a serious heavy drama plot, but it also had very sweet momemts. Taylor Lautner was amazing as always and it was finally good to see him get the girl!"
2,Rather a Bore,This film was apparently intended to be a showcase to display Taylor Lautner's muscles and teeth. Lautner's acting ability runs the emotional gamut from A to B.
1,"Bad, very bad...","I teenage wannabe Jason bourne, poor acting and weak story. Do not waste your time watching this, watch one of the bourne movies, even the new one (which is inferior)."
2,For girls,"The story line is just ok, Taylor's acting is so so, it seems to be a C type movie at best, but girls will like it because it has Taylor in it."
3,My money was Aducted,"This was suppose to be Latner's big break out. I had a hard time beliving an operation was after him and for what, information that he didn't have or knew about. The opening premise was great, but I got tired of the endless chase scene and narrow escapes - without injuries. Still, good enough to watch if nothing else is there."
2,Baby Bourne,"Expect what this movie is, a way to get the teenie boppers in the thearter for their own version of Bourne.Also Sigourney Weaver hates ballons, keep that in mind."
1,Action Flick for Teeny Boppers,"Ridiculous plot, cheesy lines, bad acting. Not sure why this film was reviewed so well unless it was a bunch of kids posting."
1,you get this for being in twilight,"horrible horrible horrible movie, and twilight was awful. i am having a glass of red wine and it's raining out. I like rain. I didn't like this movie."
2,Less than I expected,"After seeing the early video of Taylor during his karate competition, I expected some kind of... expression... from him in a real action flick.It is almost as if his costar in Twilight drained all the emotional range from him, leaving him now unable to summon more passion or expression than a block of wood.Calling him wooden is an insult to carpenters everywhere.Some other famous actors helped, but Taylor's monotone ""acting"" ruined it all.And wtf is up with the girlfriend's EYEBROWS?!? It is as if she had one huge monobrow, and the makeup department just shaved a path down the bridge of her nose and called it good.Overall the movie sucked."
1,Idiotic,This movie was the typical formula teen movie. It took it over the edge into idiot land when this kid and his friends are outsmarting the Russian mafia. Absolutely ridiculous and very bad acting. I saw the adults that were in this movie and that is why I even watched it. Don't be fooled this is a teenager movie all the way.
1,What a waste,Piss poor acting and an equally weak plot. Trying to make a suburban kid out to be like another Jason Bourne.
1,bad bad acting,"unfortunantly I watched the whole thing, starts boring, stays boring, end boringthey could of caught out the acting and maybe made a decent filmsuprised by some of the actors in it though, coat tales of twlight"
1,Good Luck!,"I made it about 45 minutes into this movie before I just gave up. Bad acting from everyone, including those who I would normally consider to be good, bad choreography, weird technical decisions. It's just not a well made movie, and it is very good proof that Taylor Lautner can not carry a movie by himself. Just...try to watch it? Then you'll understand.Good Luck."
1,Great teeny bopper..Terrible movie,"I forced myself to watch it til the end. and I can't stress ""forced"" enough here... The first 10 minutes was the worst, get through that and an eternity in hell doesn't seem so bad.At least it gave me a positive outlook on the underworld."
1,crappiest movie ever written??? ....,"probably not, but what I found interesting is even excellent actors (Molina, Weaver, Bello, etc) seem to be affected by the craptasticness of this movie and their acting was only so so...Weaver seemed uneasy and off her game...bleh. I'd never seen Lautner in the Twilight movies and I was just curious...he doesn't know how to express emotion...he looks brooding, angry and happy. That's the range of his emotion...wait, brooding anger...don't waste your free time on this movie."
3,Good movie,"Not a great movie, but a good one. I remember the very mixed and negative reviews when it came out. I don't think many of these were very fair."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but the movie was actually pretty good. Good plot, good acting, and the story line flowed."
5,"""Cuz this time I know what I am doing""","Yes you do Taylor. AND you prove you are hotter than Edward! Seems like everyone else has to compare Nate to Jacob. Let's face it he is hot, so of course he takes his shirt off (sorry Dad) but if Dwayne Johnson didn't take his off now and then it would be a shame.That was the obvious now to plot. I was curious as to the real bad guy, I was pulling for Nate to be smarter than the bad guy, and for him to get the girl. Isn't that what an action movie is for?"
4,"Starts off sort of ""meh"" but gets better","I almost gave up on this movie after he wakes up drunk on the lawn after the party, but I'm glad I didn't. It's worth watching, even though basically Taylor Lautner is the same character as his ""Twilight"" role. He even does some wolf-like moves lol. I agree that there are parts that are inconsistent, particularly how the bad guys know his every move, but then he keeps getting away, even though the cell phones are bugged. anyway it's enjoyable, for the most part."
3,Not bad,"Being an Amazon Prime member, I am always looking for a decent moving that I can watch for free, and then eventually purchase it its good. This was one of those movies. While I thought that main actor Taylor Lautner doesn't do that good of a job acting, everyone elses acting skills seem to make up for it. There are definitely times when Taylor struggles to make a few scenes believable. But that being said, everything else about the movie is fine."
3,unexpected,This movie was so unexpected exciting! I thought it would be a dramatic movie. But it was more action than drama...very disappointed. And the actors just look to young to have a relationship...
3,so-so,Not the worst action movie I've seen but far from the best. This is more of a movie to watch while doing something else as there is not much of a story line to follow and the acting is nothing spectacular.
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Teen heart-throb, Taylor Lautner, finally has his own feature film, and while the story sounded pretty good, I didn't expect much. To be honest, the only thing I've seen him in were the Twilight films and I hated them! In Abduction, Lautner shows that he's more than just a pretty face. Not only can this kid act, but he's a martial arts expert too! The story is super strong and he is supported by some great veteran character actors, like Sigourney Weaver. The story follows a boy, who while doing a school project, finds a picture of himself on a missing person website. It leads him into an unbelievable story, full of twists and turns. It's unbelievable, yes, but it's still entertaining! Abduction is an action film, with a very solid background story and some fairly big names. Don't let the big name Teen Idol starring in it, keep you away. If you love a good action film, like I do, this one's a winner!"
5,I found this movie surprisingly enjoyable,"I must say I found this movie surprisingly enjoyable partly because I suppose I wasn't expecting too much. After all it is only averaging overall 3 stars as of today. I'd say I'd give it easily between 4 and 5 stars and I decided to round up my score to a full 5 stars because it really kept my interest.I watched the beginning and felt a bit sorry for this kid who seemed to me to have a bit of an overly tough father. The father reminded me of one of my high school gym teachers. But as time went on and things began to unfold there were several twists and turns along with plenty of action.I found myself thinking several times during the movie 'wow, this is pretty cool'. I didn't expect it to be interesting and it kept me wondering what was driving everything that was happening for most of the movie. Watch it and see who you think you can trust as the plot continues to evolve. I enjoyed it and I hope you do also."
2,Teen movie,"Don't expect too much, all the interesting bits are in the movie commercial. I am happy since I did not pay to watch, it was part of my prime membership deal."
3,It was ok..,Action is good and Taylor is good at the stunts but his romance scenes are non believable lol. I would say it's ok to skip this one.
2,some interesting twists,a few interesting twists but felt longer than stated time. could have been more cleanly edited. seems like a vehicle created just for taylor lautner. michael nyqvist was the best part of this teen flick.
1,Makes Teletubbies look like Avatar,"Where to start? I should first say that I only watched the first 30 or so minutes. The first 15 minutes involves characters staring at each other with either the ""I wanna do you"" or ""I wanna kill you"" faces. If that isn't enough of a bad start we have to add the old, ""I like this girl but she is dating someone else...but it's okay because they will break-up in 5 minutes because hes a douche"", cliche. The chemistry between the two protagonists makes me cringe. Finally there is the scene where his [spoilers] fake parents are killed. The guy shoots his mom with some stupid looking gun. There is no blood to speak of after she is lying on the ground dead for 5 minutes. I swear it was a tranq gun. So in conclusion from the first 30 mintues, bad acting, overuse of cliches, and s***ty action effects. Watch at your own risk."
2,Only for Taylor Lautner/Twilight fans,"This movie was better than I thought it would be, but I rented it with really low expectations. The story idea was based on an interesting concept (i.e. a teenager discovers his face on a missing child's website). The action scenes were entertaining, even though they aren't ground-breaking. Lautner has a black-belt, so I thought he did a good job executing those scenes. However, the dialogue was PAINFUL (even when Sigourney Weaver spoke) and the ""romantic"" scenes made me cringe. The lead actress looks all of 14 years old, so I found the make-out scene more disturbing than erotic. Overall, you are more likely to enjoy this movie if you are a teenager or a Twilight/Lautner fan. Otherwise, don't expect too much and you might get a few moments of entertainment out of it."
4,not nearly as bad as I expected,"Saw this with my daughter in the theater (obviously you can guess why) and I was prepared for a disastr and I actually enjoyed it. Do not think too much especially about the ""plot"" but the movie was enjoyable. So if your kids (i.e. daughters) want to see it, it is fine for them and the parent may actually enjoy it too."
1,A soulless and incompetent action/thriller,"Words cannot describe... How awful this movie is...as I sit here, I am at a loss of words...all I can do is quote Rotten Tomatoes.This movie has a 4% rating on Rotten Tomatoes (as of 1/18/2012)""Perhaps the only way to approach Abduction that will not result in a 105-minute boredom-induced coma is to think of it as a comedy, preferably with a drinking game attached."" - James Berardinelli"
1,Perform your own root canal... way more entertaining,"Into pain? Should have been made as ""made for TV"" then scrapped. I could give some details, but even they would bore you. Enough said."
1,Skip this movie,"Very poor movie. The acting was very bad and the camera angles, zooms and ""special effects"" we're really bad. They used green screens that looked like it was from "" Fresh Prince of Bel Air."" I wouldn't waste your time."
1,Wow...just wow.,This movie was bad on so many levels. I've already wasted time and money on this movie and I refuse to waste much more than a couple of sentences here. This movie sucked. I second just about every criticism listed here already. Wow. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
2,awful,"I'll watch pretty much anything with action, but this was awful. The downfall for this movie was that it tried to incorporate too much story and dialogue. Well, there isn't much of a story here and the cast can't carry the dialogue, especially the lead. If there was more butt kicking and much less ""emotion"" and speaking lines from Lautner I may have pulled something from the film. As it stands I have wasted money and my evening. I would advise those reading this to avoid doing the same."
2,"Boring, somewhat cheesy...","This movie isn't very entertaining. It's just cheesy and I couldn't take it seriously. I like Taylor Lautner but, he was kind of lame. I wish the actors were more believable. You can't expect much when a teenagers are involved.. I was kind of hoping it'd be like Hanna. It was just a slow movie I found myself nodding off."
4,Summary,I liked it a lot but in some parts of the movie the actor Nathan over played his part. But other then that it was a good movie
2,Why did I bother?,"Ha, this film! I don't even know where to begin. I'll just say that the acting was horrendous, the plot was extremely goofy and I feel the only way anyone could rate this as 3 or more stars has to be under 15 and crushing on the lead guy. Nothing about this movie was good at all."
3,not all that bad!,Not great but worth taking a look. This is a teen movie...it will not win awards but it was fun. Keeping in mind that all movies can't be award winners I didn't think it was as bad as some critics would leave you to believe.
4,Good Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. I like suspense, and this movie had it. Yes, the acting could have been a bit better, but the storyline held my interest."
1,Awful,"This movie is just awful. If I could have given it a zero I would have. The most amateur ""A"" movie ever."
2,Cheesy teen movie with no realistic plot,"Another teen movie with no realistic plot. The acting was sub-par. The dialogue was very cheesy and, actually, just dumb. The characters went through a short build-up, hardly enough to create an attachment to them, and them were immediately drawn together while they fended off the ""black-ops"" guys and the CIA at once. This was a very bad movie. I feel sorry for the real adult actors who took on these roles. Very sad. Enjoy the movie."
1,this movie has epic fail written all over it,this movie just stinks and taylor is getting worse in his acting career this movie is lame and boring and just totally unintelligent i hate this movie with a firey passion
1,Crap,weak...very weakDon't waste your time or money on this movie. The storyline was horrible and the acting was worst than horrible. Lots of unnecessary scenes and terrible effects.
3,It's not horrible,TO be honest i figures something with the pretty twilight boy would suck. Its actually a decent movie though and went a little different than I thought it would have. Worth a watch if you're bored.
3,Movie Review,"It was an ok movie. I'm sure it would appeal to the teen crowd, more than adults. A bit predictable."
4,Entertaining,"I watched this movie not expecting a lot, but actually enjoyed it. Although not long in great acting, I found it engaging and it kept my interest throughout. For me,I always judge a movie based on whether I would watch it again, or buy the DVD and in this case, I would do both."
4,good action flick,"This is a good action flick along the lines of others where a guy is being chased for reasons unknown to him (like Bourne). It took a few minutes to get started but, once it did, Lautner did a fine job (MUCH better than those silly vampire movies). He shows great promise as an actor."
4,Pretty Decent but typical,"the fight scenes are great but we've seen the moves before. the acting is satisfactory but the girl who play (i think the character is Karen) her acting was really good. Overall I give the movie a B, just because I like action flicks. . ."
3,awful - fun - awful,"This movie isn't worth spending my energy writing about (my girlfriend made me do it) and it's probably not worth you reading about, so I'll try to make it short. The beginning is crap. Classic, horribly acted teen party scenes mercifully segue into an interesting ""father/son"" moment, followed by all hell breaking loose. It's entertaining through the middle and then drops off into happy-happy land in the end, even though the main character's life has been through the spin cycle and he would realistically going into the witness protection program."
1,Sucked!,If you care for high school tensions ... this is your movie. I watched the first 15 minutes and almost nodded out. I wasted $3.99 but learned not to go for this kind of junk.
1,"if i told you the truth, i would have to kill you","ok...after browsing a few opinions of the film, i have decided that it is bad, but also includes a lot of action, and cinema work that is at least no worse than wedding reception quality...i could use the action, but my instincts, combined with the experience of about 8,000 watched movies, are warning me away...so i think no...ciao."
3,*** An Ok action film ***,"I don't really like Taylor Lautner but I liked this movie. I had no expectations though.It's about a teenager who accidentally finds out he is adopted, and then the action starts as he is pursued by criminals who kill his parents and force him to go on the run.I found it an ok action thriller.Co-Editors ""First Year University: A Survival Guide"""
4,good for what it was supposed to be,I have seen a lot worse films than this that has gotten better reviews. The movie is what it is supposed to be a film for Taylor lovers.
3,Abduction--??,"I like Taylor Lautner,as an actor. He and most of the others did a great job. Some of the acting was a little flat in the movie. The plot was a little hard for me to follow, but maybe I am too old for some action movies. It was alright to watch on a winter afternoon, but I probably wouldn't have jumped in the car and travelled across town to the theater to see it."
3,Half baked mess,"The story line was weak, the acting worse. A real cheesy ""B"" movie. Choose your projects better next time Taylor!"
2,"not sure why, but expected better","The acting in this movie is terrible, the storyline is ridiculous and you could easily guess what would happen next. Lautner is not a leading actor by any means. He needs to stick to roles where he doesn't have to talk (or even act) much."
2,It was what it was.,It was not surprising or different from any other action film. I felt that the ending was really weak but it was what it was.
2,Ick,"Perhaps if Taylor Lautner spent the entire movie half naked, this movie might be worth it. But let's face it, he's a pretty face. After the twilight franchise is over, so his acting career."
3,Things I Learned About Taylor Lautner,"This movie taught me two things about Taylor Lautner.1) He's a terrible actor.2) He can kick ass almost as good as Liam Neeson.So as long as T-Laut isn't ever cast as a leading man again he should be able to enjoy a long career.Abduction is wonderfully written. Who hasn't sat in a high school classroom and dreamed that they'd discover they were actually involved in an international espionage plot with super martial arts skills? Unfortunately, Lautner can only scowl his way through this movie, which prevents me from giving it more than three stars. However, with Alfred Molina and Sigourney Weaver rounding out the cast, this movie is definitely worthy of a look.Abduction is action-packed, tightly constructed and well shot. It's a fun movie that you can lose yourself in for a while without having to shut your brain off."
2,Typical,"A stupid back story, predictable plot ""twist"", too long, but a decent yarn. Most plots for coming of age thrillers are juvenile. Makes you wonder who the writers and producers are."
2,It's just.... Bad,"Watch it for free. Do NOT pay for this. The plot is chopped, the directing is very poor. There is a product placement every frame of the movie, accompanied by very bad acting. I think the creators' thought was to put the shirtless wolf boy in a movie to create money without really worrying about the quality of the whole production. They failed."
3,OK,Needs more action. Overall it was a slow movie. Looks like full of action but not really.Acting was fine. There really was no need for female side-kick!
3,Simple,"Is this award winning? Maybe a Razzie, but otherwise no. But I do find it entertaining. Maybe it's just because I like looking at Taylor Lautner, but I actually don't mind this movie. Yes, the acting is pretty terrible by just about everyone in this movie, but I don't think the script was written too well either. It's all around just pretty bad, which in a way makes me like it more."
3,Mediocrity at its best.,"I bought this album in high hopes after hearing the music from ""Corner Gas."" I was overall very disappointed with the music. He's trying much too hard to mimic the music of artists like Beck and Cake, (and lyrics from John Mayer) but he fails miserably. The only good track on this album was ""Giddy Up."" If you're looking for mediocre lyrics repeated on top of annoying synthetic beats, this one's for you. Glad it was only a few bucks."
2,Not impressed with the songwriting or vocals,"I have been a serious Jonatha fan since I first heard ""Over Oceans"" by The Story. (An AMAZING a cappella track, well worth the entire price of her first album). But I agree with previous posters that the four cover songs are disappointing and uninspired, to say the least. I was very dismayed after my first listen of the CD, and it did not grow on me. This album lacks her usual sizzle and spark, her unique Jonatha style. The few songs that she did actually write don't mean anything or touch me in any way....usually I at least find one or two songs stuck in my head for days, or some choice lyrics that grab me. This album fell flat, in my opinion. She is most amazing in concert, but I have no desire to see any of these tracks performed live. I hope her next album will reflect the deep creative tendencies I know she has, instead of leaving me wondering why I just spent $17."
2,IN THREE WORDS: NOT SO GOOD,"Her best work is still with The Story - and some of those songs, by turns, funny, passionate, yearning, bittersweet, deserve repeated listenings. This CD? Initially, it seems pleasant, even diverting. But after repeated listenings, you hear the gears going around, and you realize nothing is fresh here, including the tired covers, a tip-off that Brooke had nothing to say here, only a CD to put out. And, yes, as one reviewer, asked, ""where is the passion?"" But isn't that true of so much of today's music? Where's the joy? Where's the REAL love? Those songs, those genres, those artists, are few, and they come from a better, more passionate, more engaged era. This is puny stuff and not worth your hard earned cash. Save it for Aretha Franklin!"
1,Not impressed,"I've been a fan of Jonatha Brooke since I heard the lovely ""West Point"" piping overhead at a nature boutique I frequented years ago. With the exeption on the title song, this record was a major diappointment. In the song ""Sally"" she tells her friend that she'll ""write 10 more songs"" I wish she had done just that for this release. I would highly recommend ""10 cent wings"" instead of this album if you want to experience Jonatha at her best. This work really is not an example of her artistic power."
2,Pleasant and unexceptional,"In the early 70's a critic reviewed a Neil Simon flop by observing that Simon didn't seem to have an idea for a play that year but went ahead and wrote one anyway. This wisecrack came to me while listening to this Jonatha Brooke CD.Back In The Circus has the feel of a contractual obligation record (which would explain the odd,odd covers--Brooke is holding the good material for her new label) or an attempt to capture some territory from Norah Jones (languid vocals, all those jazzy keyboard touches.) In either case, it's a disappointing experience for this long time fan. (At the very least she could have taken a moment to explain the place James Taylor, Brian Wilson and Alan Parsons have in her music.) I expect more punch, more guts and intelligence from JB than I'm getting here."
2,Not her best,"The problem with this album is Brooke's singing, which is so cool that it's almost cold. During Brooke's years in The Story, she tended to over-emote. Now she's gone too far in the other direction. A shame, because she's a great vocalist, and she still writes better music than almost anyone else in rock. (Too many cliches in the lyrics, though.)If you're new to Brooke, try The Angel in the House (by The Story), 10 Cent Wings or Steady Pull before this one."
3,Too intimate?,"Jonatha's voice is still gorgeous, and her songwriting still great, but this is a bit of a departure for her - more intimate small-band arrangements, led by Hammond-organ sound. It does sound almost like she is jumping on the Norah Jones bandwagon, though I'm sure that wasn't her intent. The original songs here are pleasant enough, but not a single one stands out, and they seem devoid of much of the energy of her previous work. Ironically, probably the best song on the CD is her cover of Alan Parsons' ""Eye in the Sky"". Her cover of ""God Only Knows"" is fine too, but ""Fire and Rain"" is a real misstep. (One thing the booklet photos establish, though: she's got great legs!) Unfortunately, my reaction to this release is a shrug and a ""so-what?"" If you want to hear an exceptional album from Ms. Brooke, try ""10-cent Wings"" - I miss the bombast and killer arrangements of that album."
4,The energy lay in the quiet sounds...,"and this journey ""Back In The Circus"" gives Jonatha another chance to shine on. The girl's in love with living and experiencing the sometimes not-so-vibrant truth of everyday life.While lacking the rocking vibes of ""Steady Pull,"" ""Circus"" offers some revamped covers of materials that lend themselves well to Johatha's personality.""God Only Knows"" isn't the vibrant mix of Brian Wilson's vision but works beautifully at getting the point across.The same is true of ""Fire and Rain."" Her cover of ""Eye In The Sky"" is probably the truest to original stylings, but it's the orignal works that still make me happy the world has Jonatha Brooke to call it's own."
3,Losing Touch,"How I wanted to love this CD. I hope(d), in vain, for something like another ""Plumb."" I'm losing touch with where Jonatha is headed. This might be OK, were it not for canned drums, an absolute record-scratched massacre of James Taylor's ""Fire And Rain"" and an increasing shrillness in her vocal stylings. That she is one of the best and under-recognized singer/songwriters in recent history remains undisputed. I am, however, deeply concerned about her and her music becoming increasingly gimmicy and her persona less genuine (fishnet stockings and high wires - oh come on). This is probably a well intended but hopelessly misguided attempt to boost record sales and name recognition (a tragic irony). We'll see. At the moment, I'm looking forward to attending her next solo acoustic set. Hopefully, it will be absent of programming."
1,such a deal,$1.50 for 447 whole words. you can get this and more for free on the net with minimal effort. Try Wikipedia and the link there to the NY Times obit. This can't be serious.
4,Great CD,"This is a great CD that I can listen to all of the time. In the car, when I get ready and if I want to dance. It has great beats and gets your energy flowing and your body moving. I highly recommend this for anyone that likes house music."
2,A little cheesy for my tastes,"Sounds a little like 1993 techno with a ""little"" reengineering. This is not a top notch track selection."
5,Super High-Energy House,"Don't put this CD into your stereo unless you are prepared to MOVE! Right from the get-go Dan establishes a mad energy level with Chris Lum's barn-burner, Big Tool. And through 2 discs and over 2 hours worth of mixing, he never lets up. This is the kind of music that gets the dancefloor packed - somewhere between house and techno, but not too dark and not too light. Just really high-energy music formulated to make you DANCE. Great crescendos, addictive synths and kickin' bass. Dance music lovers, do yourselves a favor and pick this one up. Well done, DJ Dan."
5,Sullen Beauty,"Buckethead may be most famous for his shredding and outright obnoxious playing style. any arguement that he is limited by his tendency to be too to shred-reliant is quashed with this effort. electric tears, which features nothing but layerings of bucketheads guitars, is a modern masterpiece and is a new take on how an album can be made and a guitar played. from beginning to end it flows seemlessly while fluctuating interestingly. by showing a softer, more melodic style, buckethead proves his versatility and sheer skill in electric tears. don't pass it up"
3,Not all I hoped for,"After reading all the rave reviews, I really expected another Colma (or better!). I'm a huge Buckethead fan, Colma is one of my all-time favorite albums, and I'm also into Monsters and Robots, Praxis, and I like most of the other stuff as well.Electric Tears is, well, nice. Put it on in the background for your new age hot tub party. Very pretty, not very challenging harmonically or technically, wonderful background music, the kind of thing you can have on at work or while studying, because it's not too distracting. Not sure if Buckethead was feeling a little drowsy when he put this together, or if hanging out with G'n'R has dulled his musical sensibility, but Electric Tears is definitely going to the back of my Buckethead stack."
2,Monotonous,Nice melodies that do not go any where. Nothing is develpoed. After a couple of listenings I will probally not listen again. Nothing at all like I have seen on you tube and DVDs. Very mellow
4,Nice Ambient Music,Wonderful guitar. Ambient. Lovely. It's another genre that Buckethead has completely mastered.
2,Ok at best,"Buckethead is an amazing and the most unique guitarist I've ever heard. I adore some of his other cds but electric tears just doesn't cut it as a great guitar cd. The mode of the cd is somber,icey cold and emotionless. The songs are all incredibly slow and simple. The songs do not fluctuate in tempo and feeling therefore creating an overall monotone vibe. Buckethead uses an abundance of generic effects that any other guitarist would use, that of course is not a great quality. I was looking for something unique in this cd but found it to be too similar to Pink Floyd's The Division Bell.I do not recommend this cd to anybody unless you have insomnia. I recently discovered several cds with powerhouse,classical influenced, very unique and emotional guitar playing...those cds are Rainbow On Stage and Rainbow Live in Europe. The guitarist is Ritchie Blackmore."
4,Electric AND Acoustic Tears,"As my 16 yr old daughter, says ""This is gorgeous!"" Which is great to hear, 'cause I thought maybe only old farts like me would be enjoying it so much. I've heard only a bit of Buckethead's more mainstream shred-heavy stuff, which seems skilled, if perhaps a bit predictable. No credit is given in the (sparse) liner notes for who is playing what, so I assume it is all Buckethead - on acoustic and electric guitars, and synthetic treatments.This instrumental recording is mellow and melodic, tasteful, atmospheric and pensively subdued (the ""tears"" part I guess). The electric guitar playing here sometimes sounds like Mark Knopfler's, but the overall mood/effect kind of reminds me of something Canadian electronic guitarist/composer Michael Brook would do. Maybe not world class, but pleasant, soothing, and interesting enough for both fore and background ambiance..."
5,Love the series.,Riders of the Suwannee makes me want to learn more about early Florida. I have read several of the stories and leaves me wanting more.
4,Thumbs up for Cracker Westerns,"This book was a great read. It reminded me of Louis L'amour's Sackett novels, but with a Sunshine State twist. I recommend this book for any fan of both Westerns and Florida stories."
5,Tai Chi for kids,Excellent book for teaching tai chi and relaxation to children. Great descriptions for relaxation and good pictures for tai chi.
2,Disappointing,"The series has a few strengths, which Mr. Probert's review does a good job of highlighting. The story is fairly unique for an anime and is fairly intriguing, and the soundtrack is pretty strong. Kodama is a pretty interesting lead character. However, for me, the numerous failings of the series seriously detract from what it does well. The pacing is indeed very uneven, and several episodes simply distract from the overall story. The animation is sub par. There are a few nagging inconsistencies, and occasionally, the laws of physics simply get ignored. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,"Excellent, but way overpriced for its size","In terms of quality, this is an excellent collection. Warrick has selected outstanding stories that cover a wide time span--enough from the founders to be substantial, and a great selection of mid-year sci fi (50s to 70s). Two of my favorite stories of all time are included (by Butler and Tiptree)--and these are ones hard to get anywhere else. But....you would be better off looking for one of David Hartwell's books, which offer more value."
4,Great artist; underappreciated,"Alix Korey is a singer that one can only hope will get greater recognition. This album offers some beautiful gems that touch your heart and mind. I was introduced to Alix's singing on a David Friedman compilation (I'll Be Here With You) on which she performs ""My Simple Christmas Wish""--outstanding and so very funny. Get this when it's back in stock. You will not regret it."
3,Miles in Transition,"This album has some lively melodius tracks but also gets into some of the more rambling, avant garde, odd sounding compositions which were a prelude to Bitches Brew which was released in 1970. Some this work is certainly challenging to listen to, and this album is not for the jazz novice. This is more likely to be appreciated by the experienced, sophisticated jazz listener, and true Miles buffs who enjoy his various modes of expression. For more of the ""straight ahead"" fine progressive jazz that Miles could play, I recommend his earlier works from the fifties and early sixties."
2,"Only for children, teens, very low functioning adults & those who need to help them","The autism-Aspergers continuum is quite long. This book is not helpful for people on the higher-functioning half of the spectrum. It contains information about getting and keeping entry level jobs, how to deal with the police, suggestions for making money by dumpster diving, etc. Some people may need this information, but potential buyers should be aware that the book addresses problems of children, of teens and of adults who have been unable to extablish themselves in life. It is not helpful to adults with Aspergers who hold or have retired from a professional level job, who generally function at an adequate level and are looking for ways to refine their interpersonal skills."
2,The basics of autism?,"The description of this book sounded interesting and I like to read autobiographical books about people living with AS. This book, however, was not at all what I was hoping for, and I ended up returning it. It was way too basic for me. It might be good for someone just learning how to live with autism but I did not need the basic information provided such as how to cross streets and how to drive through a town."
5,Jihad Explained,"As a former military intelligence officer who spent years reading a mountain of books by and about Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mao, Debray, et al, in order to understand how the enemy thought, I truly appreciate the work of Mary Habeck distilling the jihadist ideology into 243 pages. Having lived and worked daily with Muslims in Pakistan for more than a year and having read many books on Islam, I never found a single, satisfactory source on the subject of jihad that provided a concise historical prospective until I read ""Knowing the Enemy."" There's currently almost an unlimited number of books on the subjects of Islam and jihad, but Mary Habeck has condensed the essentials into one small volume that is brutally factual about the dark side of Islam without being inflammatory. This book should be a required high school and college history/political science text in the U.S. and Europe. I heartily recommend it to anyone who cares about the future of Western Civilization."
4,Knowing the Enemy: Jihadist Ideology and the War on Terror,"I bought this book because I wanted answers to the question, ""Why do they hate us so much."" Unfortunately, I didn't like the answers but at least I understand better whatwe are up against. The book was extensively footnoted and sometimes got a little dry, but overall it was a good read and I have recommended it to my friends.Ms. Habeck does a nice job of distilling a complex socio-religious movement into the kind of prose which highlights the fanaticism of the jihadists. My take away from this book is that the ""War on Terror"" is indeed going to be a long struggle. Unfortunately, their desire for a theistic caliphate is at odds with the principles of democracy and the desires of free people everywhere. Once again the name of God is used for evil. We must win this war."
3,"Jihadists, the New Form of NIMBY","This is an interestingly book which explores the particulars of transnational terrorism from within its prism as a religious political movement. Habeck provides the background in such a manner, in which novice students in political science, criminal justice, international affairs, sociology and economics can easily comprehend in the machinations of jihadists and jihad. Moreover, she systemically discusses the foundational basis for this ideology from its 1928 inception to the present.This is an above board read for all those concerned with transnational terrorism, and it's potential of morphing within America's public spaces, into urban jihads."
5,Wow!!,"Great song!! Refreshing in todays ""cookie cutter"" music industry. Can't wait to hear more from this group."
3,I love the song...I love the lack of 'bonus' tracks not.,"I'm actually feeling the groove the new girl-group Dream has with their catchy tune ""He Loves U Not."" However the reason why I'm giving it just three stars instead of four or five is due to the CD single not having any B-sides or extra tracks to check out, apart from the karaoke version of the hit song (I've done this once before with reviewing another single, Hoku's ""Another Dumb Blonde""). Nonetheless, it's a great song to listen to, and I look forward to their album coming in mid-January."
5,bad boy does it again,"yo, i'm feelin' this song. it's a hot track and they will get big play from MTV in a couple of days. for bad boy records (which is headed by puffy and is, or used to be, strickly for hip-hop/r&b) to branch out into pop is one thing. but to be able to do it and be successful is another, and with dream, they did that. and to all the hater's out there, you will be hearing dream on your radio soon b/c the remix is hotter than the radio cut featuring puffy and g-dep. aight, holla."
4,Fun Pop Tune,"This is a catchy enough piece of pop, the verbal battle is something that makes this enjoyable, along with danceable beat, and the vocals are okay too. My two worries are that this will be more overplayed than it already is, and hit the annoying meter, or that the girls, who are VERY manufactured, (They dialed 1-800-Be-a-Star for an audition!) will not have more single material that stands up to this. I'll have to wait and see on both matters though."
5,He Loves U Not....WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I've only heard this song once or twice within the last few days...and I absolutely fell in love with it!!!! I remember hearing that Dream is a new group on Puff Daddy's label. It's just like one of those songs that you want to hear over and over again....except I don't have the CD...so now I HAVE to go out and buy it!!!!...you should too...You won't be sorry!
2,Bad Boy????,"I'm sorry, since when is Bad Boy Records interested in Teen Pop? Has anyone actually listened to this song? It's somewhere between Britney Spears and 702. Listen guys, I know Biggy's dead (RIP), Kim left, and Puff can't rap but that's no excuse for Bad Boy to go into Teen Pop. Sorry Puff but you just lost the last bit of respect I had for you."
4,the song was really good,"i saw them on jenny jones and i thought that the song was really good. then i heard the song on the radio and i loved it. i think that it is so cool that they are all under 16 and can sing really good. the songs are not like other pop songs and i love the beat to ""he loves you not""."
5,catchy...,"This is my fav song right now, very catchy and fun to sing along to...these girls are gonna be BIG!!!"
5,BEST SONG!,"Hey, I heard this song for the first time about 2 weeks ago and I freaked out because it was so good. I can't believe they're 15 and 16 years old! I can't wait until their full album comes out"
5,bad girls of america,"this is an inlightening book about a young girls struggles with addiction. abigail vona is a typical teenage girl that happens to make mistakes that land her in a level 3 lockdown facility. this is a great book for young girls struggling in there own lives, a way to see how bad someones life can truely be. this book brings you into a world most people will never have to expiriance. everything from restraintment to finding whats really important."
1,Horrible,"An advertisement for an abusive facility that breaks kids and then puts them back together as brainwashed robots... as told by one of their so-called 'successes'. Shocking only in the way that the author seems to truly believe that being isolated from human contact, allowed no friends and no conversation, and spending most of the day sitting on her bed (not being allowed to talk or even look at things), truly helped her 'recover'."
4,"Pretty Good, But...","""Bad Girl"" by Abigail Vona is a good look into the life of a teen out of control and placed in a facility to help change her wild ways. Although she wasn't all that wild, the facility helps her cope with her dysfunctional family life, and the way she views her actions. She meets other girls with problems even worse than hers, but learns to listen to them, whether their life stories or advice to her. ""Bad Girl"" is a truue story of what happens when a teen ""delinquent"" is sent away to confront her life and problems. Although this book isn't as good as, say, ""A Million Little Pieces,"" it still speeds along quickly and is very intriguing."
4,Great price,Well the service was great and the product was a amazing price my only complaint is that the product detail said there was hardly wear and tear at all almost looks new but the bind is so worn that the cover just flops open and closed. but beside that i love the book!!!
2,did not enjoy very much.,"i got this book a long time ago, and i was very disappointed when i read it. i just thought it would be more interesting, and it wasn't."
4,ZGood Stuff,"haven't used it much, seems to do an ok job,, so far though, I haven't been impressed, maybe I'm not doing it right, I got it mainly to clean the stove top, I really haven't gotten into it yet, will add later"
1,Sucks,"This did not clean as promised. It was a huge waste of money, I sent mine back, I was so angry."
1,"Not ""astonishing"" at all!","First of all, it's the delivery speed. I placed my order on Sept 23 when I really needed it to deal with my burnt pots, and it is not until today, Oct 4, is it put on my doormat. Wow, terrific speed!Second, it's not efficient as the ad shows, not at all. I applied it on the scouring pad as instructed, scrubbing my burnt cookware for like two minutes. The result is disappointing. I still gotta use the tip of my spoon the get rid of the numerous tiny black spots remained on the bottom of the pot. Considering the price and its efficiency, I strongly recommend anyone who wants to buy it for burnt cookwares to search for other products. It's not even a satisfactory product, not to mention ""astonishing."""
4,Just OK,"I see nothing astonishing about this. It did an OK job, but nothing better than any other product would do. It did not mean I required less elbow grease, or got the job done any quicker."
4,"Great, but doesn't do everything","First, this stuff is a light abrasive, so be careful (it does say so on the label). It worked very well on the normal spills and cooked on stuff, even with modest effort. But I have some spills that weren't cleaned up right away...those that are twice or thrice cooked. Against those, this stuff had no chance. It will require an overnight soak in oven cleaner."
2,Very disappointed,"I don't recommend using this to clean your oven! Creates a real mess everywhere. And quite honestly didn't work very well anyway. I used elbow grease, and every other muscle I have, but it really did not do much. My oven wasn't even that dirty! Maybe it would work on smaller jobs, but as I used pretty much the whole tub and threw the rest away, I guess I'll never know. Guess it's back to the toxic spray stuff--at least it works. Very expensive mistake on my part."
2,Ordinary cleaner,"This cleaner costs 3-4 times more than a bottle of Soft Scrub. I don't see any differences. It is not a bad cleaner, but it is just not extraordinary."
3,Oven Cleaner,This product was used by husband and he said it was good but not great. It took likes of elbow grease and it did not take all of the burnt spot out. I loved it because it didn't have a terrible smell lik EASY OFF.
3,Acceptable - Not Astonishing,"This product serves as a fine replacement to Comet or Ajax for those of us who dislike using bleach - it does absolutely everything that Ajax can do, and that is pretty groovy.However, it under-performs as a replacement for ammonia-based oven cleaners. It does not equal a real oven cleaner's strength or efficacy inside the oven. In regards to those heavy layers of black backed-on chunks, it cleared out maybe 75 percent from my oven (which was not excessively dirty to start out with) and after that no amount of elbow grease or steel wool or extra cleaner was getting that last 25 percent off.Avoiding harsh chemical cleaners is a goal of mine and this product is great in the bathroom and on my stainless steal kitchen sink - but below par in the oven. That being said I'll keep using it in the oven to avoid the use of ammonia-based cleaner. Results were acceptable, but not astonishing."
4,More of the Anywheres,"Someone is always going to abuse power. The Crestomancis are supposed to stop the most dangerous, the magic makers. I liked comparing the nuturing magic families of Caprona in Chrestomanci homeworld with the oppressive anti-magic witch burning world of the successful Guy Fawkes. Both of them are real trouble. They have powerful magic users reacting, lashing out actually, on lies. Fawkes world is much darker than Caprona, but you can still get enchanted into a rotten vegetable just because someone says you've insulted the rival party's kid in Caprona.Not enough of Chant scaring the pants off the denizens, or frustrating the Gwendolyn types. I believe even he would think twice about taking on one of those Italian great aunts. Still waiting for the much more ferocious Gabriel DeWitt to cut down the best laid plots of mice and men. Much entertainment here, but start with the 1st two books in Vol 1 to get the feel of how dangerous the Chrestomanci is."
4,I LOVE THIS CD!,I'm a yoga instructor and use this CD in my classes. It's very upbeat with a nice blend of east meets west. You can dance to it but it's also very nice to listen to. It makes you want to move. All my students have asked about this CD so they can have it for their own collection.
5,Best book on the subject,This is the best book on Mind Mapping. We use it at work and the techniques are well explained. If I had to buy just one book n the subject this one would be it.
1,Disappointing,"If you already know how to write an outline for an essay and you know how to brainstorm then this book isn't worth your time or money. Mind maps are just outlines that include creativity; drawing pictures, pictograms and writing themes on branches radiating out from the center of the page."
4,Challenging puzzle,"This puzzle presented somewhat of a challenge as all of the pieces, except for the edge pieces were basically the same shape. This is no slight against the puzzle itself, but is just the way the manufacturer (Sunsout) cuts the pieces. When it was finished, the picture was really nice.During the construction of the puzzle, one of the pieces got damaged. Sunsout's customer service department was very prompt in responding to my email about a replacement piece. They asked me to tell them the UPC code and a specific manufacturing code found on the box and asked me to take pictures of where the damaged piece would go, I assumed, so they would be able to send me a properly cut replacement piece. Instead, within a few days, I recieved a whole new puzzle by priority mail."
3,Spirulina,I have not used much of it yet. Still using it. Taste is a bit strong but I use it with vanilla whey and peanut butter in a smoothy type drink.
1,bad quality,it was for my mom and she said this is really low quality spirulina compared with the one she tried before.
3,"Good price, decent quality","I was excited to find such a great deal on organic spirulina, as I add it to my green smoothies in the morning. I was disappointed, however, because it has a lot stronger and more intense taste than the (pricier) spirulina I had been using. So as a result I add less to my smoothies, and get less of the benefit. I also was surprised to see its color, which was not the vibrant, beautiful blue-green I'm used to with spirulina. It's just dark green. I don't know if that means anything as far as quality/freshness, but I miss the beautiful color the other spirulina turned my smoothies!"
3,yuck!,"I really, really wanted to like this. I figured it would be a great addition to my morning smoothies. Wow, it tastes horrible... exactly how you would think algae would taste. The aftertaste is gross as well. If you want to try this I would recommend getting a very small bottle of it first ;-) Good luck!"
1,Charged for an item on back order and no shipment date given,"I placed an order and received part of it. The statement sent with that shipment said the other item was on back order. But, I was charged for the back-ordered item. I consider that to be a bad policy. Also, I was given no estimate of when it would ship. I will not order from this company again."
2,"Nastiest taste ever, and very thick!","I wanted to puke, tasted soo nasty, I wish I could send this back for a refund!!! But for the benefits, I wish I had gotten the tablets, then I might take it for the health benefits!!"
1,NO MORE,"More of the greatest hits of the B-O-C. The songs are great, don't get me wrong. Some executive at their old label wants to bleed the Oyster Boys for all they're worth. My vampire tattoo seal of approval is not on this one. No more compilations of their former glory."
5,Love this foundation!,"As with all Clinique products, this is outstanding. It goes on smoothly, stays on well, lasts a long time, is easy to pack for traveling, and also has the added SPF of 15. The only thing I wish was that Clinique would bring back the 05 deep shade, I miss it! It matches my skin color much better."
1,All of it?,The book description says that there are 80 pages. Is this correct? If so it wouod seem that something is not right..
1,Total Waste of Time,"There is nothing in this book that is not available in a general self-help on having a better sexual relationship with your significant other. There is no meaningful discussion about real energy sharing, opening chakras, kundalini, or even real Tantric sexual practices. Complete waste of time."
1,essay,"Wow, how did I miss the reviews on this fluffed up essay disguised as a book. Shameful that they even charge for it."
5,Superb!,I had read 'Leaving a Trace: Keeping a Journal' by Ms. Johnson and found it the most inspiring book on writing a personal journal that I have ever read...and I have read a few! This is the one that did it for me. It really got the juices flowing and even helped me to overcome my complex over my dyslexia. So when I discovered quite by accident Ms. Johnson's book 'The Hidden Writer' (Hardback) in a local charity shop I bought it without hesitation. I have just finished it and found it so engaging I didn't want it to end. I have been desperately looking for more books by Alexandra Johnson and have discovered that she will have a new book out in Septemeber 2010 titled A Brief History of Diaries: From Pepys to Blogs. I can't wait.
3,You can get these much cheaper...,"I've found most of these movies in the six dollar bin at Wal Mart over the past few months. Pick the ones you want and buy them. Save your money on the others.By the way, the Jerry Seinfeld one is kind of funny, but not nearly as funny as his shows were. If you expect it be 'rolling on the floor' funny, you will be disappointed."
5,Not exactly ...,"While most of these movies are in the bargain bin, Meatballs is very hard to come by. If you find it in a bargain bin, buy it. Buy all they have. Run the search on here, or E-Bay or Half and see what those are going for. It's crazy. It's a great movie, but $30-$75 for Meatballs! Well, I guess ... It just doesn't matter ... It just doesn't matter ... It just doesn't matter ... Dan"
2,No patterns - No templates - Only Pretty Photos,"I purchased this book online in the hopes of discovering some great creative ideas. Though the photos were wonderful, I was very displeased with the lack of actual crafty, DIY projects in the book. For the ones that were provided, there were NO templates or patterns to use. For example, page 29 references an adorable Daisy Flower Shaped invitation. The instructions meerily say, ""Sketch your own 7"" daisy template..."" Sure, that is all fine and dandy... if I had drawing talent! It would of been great if the author would of supplied an actual 7"" template in the back of the book to photocopy."
5,Great Original Ideas,"Just the inspiration I was looking for! The recipes are simple and unique. The photos are beautiful and really illustrate how color and textures can make a big impact on your shower or party theme. I like the way the information is organized, especially the sources in the back of the book. They even include ideas for the nursery and special keepsakes. If you enjoy planning parties, but want to try something a little different and contemporary, you will get great ideas from this book"
2,Lacking in substance,"I agree with the reader from Manhattan - I was looking for a book with loads of ideas to pick from, not with 5 ideas elaborately laid out. If you happen to like one of the themes they suggest (which I don't even think are that creative, I've seen all the same ones online), then you're all set with a color scheme and menu. If not, you just wasted your money. (It's very quick to flip through - go to the bookstore and see if you like anything in it before buying.) If you're only going to buy one book, I'd recommend buying a general party-planning/catering book and get baby-specific ideas online."
3,Could have been better...,"I was looking for something more substantive - more of an overall book with a lot of ideas. If you want something to have it all, I would recommend another book."
3,Not so many ideas....,"I too, was looking for a book with a wider variety of ideas. I found the shower ideas to be nice, but the food was not something I would prepare, least especially for a larger shower. However, I will say that the checklist is fantastic for those of us who may be a bit unorganized or inexperienced in party plamning of any kind!"
1,Find a Better Book,"I found this book in the bargain section and purchased to plan my best friends baby shower. This book offered few useful suggestions and the recipes were nothing that would be served at a larger gathering. For a VERY small shower, this might be a helpful book. But for those of us planning for more than five people, this book offers no helpful solutions."
2,You'll know why the price is reduced...,"It is a pretty book, but for the advanced party throwers.There are quite a few really difficult recipes. So if you'relooking for recipes, it might be good for you. Otherwise itdoesn't give many other ideas."
5,Excellent book: every indian should read it,"This book exposes what islam has been doing to the world. It also exposes the rigid belief of islamic followers in the non-arab countries of the world like pakistan,malaysia,indonesia etc.I have traveled to these countries and agree with the author. The Buddhist and Hindu cultures have been eroded by the islamic fundamentalists.Non-muslims face a bleak future wherever islamic fundamentalist are a majority. Look at kashmir, indonesia,libya, egypt. Christians torn apart in indonesia, kashmiri hindus being looted, raped and brutally killed.Please read this book with an open mind and things would make sense. Keep up the good work naipaul!"
2,"Dry and tangential, disappointing.","I don't like writing negative reviews, but I should have remembered that I couldn't finish the other book I tried to read by this author. I thought I'd learn about Islam and the reasons people seem so devoted to it, but so far it seems about economics and everything but how the religion impacts people. On the other hand, if the hopelessness and misery related throughout the book is a result of Islam, then maybe I don't want to know any more about it."
1,prejudicial,"The book gives the impression that the arabs through Islam are colonizing the non-arab muslims. It is full of selected one-sided mini-biographies of people that repeatedly attack Islam, directly and indirectly. The other side of the story is for the most part missing, the side of the many people who practice Islam and are not only Muslims by name. Through the focus on such one-handed interviews the book in effect is putting pre-conceived prejudicial stereotypes and words in the mouths of such interviewees. It would not befit a purportedly educated person to paint brush the west with a single stroke of erasing the cultures of the converted people to Democracy. The same can be said of Islam. let the people freely chose their way of life be it in the USA or in India. In a nutshell, Utterly biased!"
1,More drivel. The man is tireless and doesn't improve at all.,"Mr. Naipaul is consistently losing a reputation built over some good early novels. The recent travel books are so naive, biased and pathetic that one wonders how he gets away with writing such bad and dishonest --- shall we say fiction even though these are travel books. And yet the myopic junta which looks at CNN to develop a world perspective, finds in his works an excellent confirmation of all the images of ghouls and demons associated with Muslims which they have all been indoctrinated with. The ideal bogey man creator for them, at least V.S. Naupaul has finally discovered himself and recognised his cause. Muslim hating can be a profitable and highly respectable status. A membership of the BJP may be in the offing. Lets see how much more nonsense will we have to put up with courtesy this remarkable 'scholar' of Islam and Muslim societies."
1,Naipaul tries to become another Rushdie..to woo the west..,"The subject book is an effort of Mr. Naipaul to woo the west, like that of Salman Rushdie. It is clear that his mind is preoccupied with prejudices about Islam and tried to write this novel based on that. After reading the book, one may come to the conclusion that whatever muslims do is bad and whatever non-muslims do good. This book is written keeping in mind the economic benefit it may bring to the auther. Because ""Criticizm of Islam"" is fast moving commodity now a days."
3,Preconceptions,"Naipaul presents descriptions that attempts to blend literature with factual reporting. The problem is that the outcome is neither objective nor factual and is a mishmash of anecdotal claptrap and long-winded descriptions. The outcome is interesting to the extent that it offers some insight on Muslim cultures, yet it lacks the thoroughness of essays that a historian or a political scientist would be capable of producing."
2,"Literate, readable, superficial and unsympathetic.","Popular as well written and a rare book on an important but ignored world of Islam. But has the temporary satisfaction and nutritional value of junk food. The problem is some superficiality and some bias that does not lead the reader to better understanding and alternate and deeper sources. The reader really will not much better understand momentous events in Indonesia or important trends and issues in Malaysia or Pakistan -- the problem is he may be deceived into thinking he does. the paucity of good material is part of why such books flourish. (I visit Malaysia annually, taught Islamic history for a number of years in the 60's)."
1,superficial and ignorant,"naipaul's excursions reads more like a tourist whose condescension of the people he writes about is matched by the long drinks he downs at the end of his business days - i.e it has no bottom. sad, really."
1,Poor Understanding of the Culture,This is a very poor understanding of Asian culture. Author is jumping to conclusion without much facts. His knowledge is very very superficail.Authour should focus on something which he really knows.This book is a total waste to time and money!
1,biased exploitation of islamic beliefs,"The author is on the mission to disseminate misinformation on Islam and describes one sided biased view of him. The author shows no understanding of Islam or Islamic history. His perception of Islam is cloulded by his hate and prejudice against Islam. Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world and will surpass Christianity in five years. All west now can do is to rely on proven propaganda against Islam. They use terms like Jihad, fundamentalism, so on, and their definition is different than Islamic definition. In the end these views only ignite hatreted between Islam and other religions."
1,I think this is a totally prejudiced sterotyping of Islam,"I am a HAPPILY BALANCED MUSLIM from India. Islam has brought me back to myself and my being. I have suffered atrocious prejudice under the extremely caste-mentality Hindus of India. ""Blended"" Broken marriages and other ridiculous marriage instituions exist in NON ISLAMIC cultures. Gay couples, Bondage and so on so forth. Naipul says Islam fosters broken families, THE BOOK DOES NOT TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE HE INTERVIEWED and what the control was. Such skewed subjective reporting needs to be banned! DISGUSTED READER"
5,A FINE BOOK,"This book squares completely with the books on Arab, Islamic, Iranian and Turkish history I have read -- it adds a human dimension to those historical works. I was so impressed that I picked up a copy of Among the Believers -- I'm reading it now."
1,Naipul 's manual of hate: Uncle Tom from Trinidad,"To the use of the average westerner : it is not clear where this hate of islam comes from , what is clear is that Naipul is very uncomfortable with the color of his skin. Whatever grief this gothim over the years in RACIST Britain , he seems to channel intohate and disdain for ""The believers"" , that is exactly what his gracious european hosts wanted to hear , so much so , the swedes gave himtheir ultimate prize . In Israel , he was ill treated because ofhis dark skin, he turned back and refused the prize he was about to receive.If a manual of hate is what you are looking for , search no more."
1,This book is beyond belief!,"If one is to follow the premise of a converted people, than Europeans are converted Christians; Chinese are converted Buddists, the Africans, South Americans, North Americans.......are all converted. The title should be something absurd like 'How I hunted witches where there were none'."
1,HORRENDOUS AND HIGHLY ASSUMPTIOUS BOOK!,"It is probably BY FAR the WORST of Mr. Naipaul's book!!! I am his fan but in this book he messes up BIG TIME! His whole assertive opinions here and there w/o CLEARLY stating his reasons behind his assumptions was AWFUL. For example, In his book Naipaul states that all of the people BEYOND ARABIA WERE CONVERTS! WEll DA! The whole Arabian peninsula converted just like the Christians converted upon beleiving in Jesus. WHO EVER follows a religion then by his logic IS A CONVERT. And just as when an empire or religion conqers a country the people of that country slowly over generations gets absorbed by the new culture which conqured them!"
1,Garbage,Naipaul's book is 100% garbage. It is a racist and Islamaphobic rant designed to defame the Islamic religion.
2,musical trend,"and here we have yet another installment in the ""standard radio hits"" category, most of these songs were the only big hits for these bands, and unfortunately the only songs by the bands, that most people ever hear. It ceases to amaze me that the most popular and recognized songs from the seventies or eighties or whatever, are very, very seldomly the BEST songs.This is a good addition if you have a collection of ""best of's"",but if you want to really here the good stuff, then buy each individual artists albums or just the ones you like. it's the only way to really find out what's good and what's not."
1,Insufficient guide,"I am terribly unsatisfied with this book. I was searching for recipes related to feeding child with ADD and this popped up. Unfortunately Ms. Goodyke eliminates mostly corn products which are only one of 5 areas for my son. Due to sensitivities to chocolate (which is in most of the sweets) and any sugar most of these were complete unusable. I have reverted to allery cookbooks (much much better) and candida diet/recipe books (which are awesome for eliminating most common allergens). There is not even reference to alternatives for wheat, eggs etc."
5,Love,"Why did I not buy this brush earlier in my life? I thought that forty dollars seemed a bit extreme for a hair brush. But, you use the thing everyday, it works so well, it actually gets through to the scalp and it does do amazing blowouts. But beyond that, its well made, it will last for many years with proper care. Its a game changer."
4,Great praise songs,"I bought this to have ""Faith"" (the song, too :) ), after our praise band sang it. All the songs are wonderful. The only complaint I have with the album is Darlene Zschech's inability to talk between songs other than a high-pitched monotone yell."
1,I'd give it Zero stars if I could.,"I bought this toaster two Christmases ago and am now shopping for a new one. This toaster has been, since day one, a piece of crap. We don't ask it to do much - just make a couple pieces of toast (regular bread) every now and then. Even on this simple task, it is hit or miss - the toast is either burned, or not toasted at all. It is a rip-off."
5,great toaster,I have this toaster and I love it. It makes perfect toast. I even have the toaster sandwich maker and it works great to. Perhaps the other reviews do not understand how to make toast.
4,GOOD RIDDANCE AARON,Fitting goodby to a really rotten character. It's tough to keep a reader interested for three novels but Diehl has managed well. I liked this book but Primal Fear was the best of the lot. If you haven't read the two previous novels please do so before this - you won't be disappointed. I look forward to Mr. Diehls' next work with or without Mr. Vail.
2,"Multiple story ideas and Aaron end up in as ""Reign In Huh?"".","I totally expected ""Reign In Hell"" to be another excellent book and wind up (perhaps) the Aaron Stampler vs. Vail theme. One out of two. The book seems to me to be a parade of well written short stories or book ideas quickly woven into a Vail/Stampler thriller. The thrill just wasn't there this time though. I still love Diehl's work and anxiously await his next book."
3,oy!,"Though the book is well-written and has a solid structure, it seems to me that this is a desperation attempt by Diehl to profit from his very successful Aaron Stampler character. I liked the premise of the book, and the initial development is superb, but rather than continue developing the story in a logical and patient manner, Diehl skips right to the climax about 300 pages too quickly. The ending was predictable and thoroughly unsatisfying. This book is, unfortunately, a dime store novel; an effort far below the par excellence Diehl has maintained in the past."
2,I don't recommend this if you like the Stamplet-Vail plot,"This really didn't have to do anything with the character of Aaron Stamplet because he was just a subplot. It will give you a fresh start but as you read along who'll find out that the chilling plot between Stampler and Vail is lost. So it's kinda disappointing for me and I didn't actually enjoy readin' this book. Take it from a Stampler-Vail avid fan. But the hihgly recommended William Diehl's two prequels - PRIMAL FEAR, and SHOW OF EVIL. Now, you won't be disappointed in these."
4,"Great build up, disappointing ending","William Diehl's book is an absorbing thriller about a rogue militia group. The only problem is that he decided to graft a Martin Vail book onto it. The result is that you spend 3/4 of the book waiting for some sort of fascinating legal and/or action showdown with Martin in the middle and instead he's cut out of the climax. The Aaron Stampler character is completely out of place in this novel. He adds little except a familiar name and a selling point for the novel. Diehl could have cut him out and nothing would have been lost. Still, the plot threads together nicely and I was up until 1 A.M. reading in a white heat trying to see how these elements would fit together. The ending works, but is disappointing in its result."
2,Weak story flow with little action,I just finished reading this book and tried to remember what really happened. The answer is not much. I am disappointed with this book as its my first and probably last Diehl. Martin Vail just didn't mean much to this story.
2,VAIL / STAMPLER doesn't work a third time,"Fortunately, I read Primal Fear and Show of Evil before reading Reign in Hell. The first two were top notch novels - a wonderful combination of psychological, legal, and police procedural elements that work well in these 2 thrillers. Diehl should have stopped there, as this third novel pales in comparison.Seems as if he did not know where to take the Martin Vail/ Stampler story next, and tried to wrap it around a shoot em up ""Waco"" style confrontation.Don't waste your money on it if you are hoping for more content similar to the first two books. Take it out at your local library or find it in the $1.00 stacks if you MUST follow through on the ""trilogy"".Better to stop after PRIMAL FEAR, and SHOW OF EVIL.Read some of his other stuff - but pass on Reign in Hell."
3,Must Have Missed Something,"I listened to this story while commuting to and from work and was surprised to find the same characters as in Primal Fear. However; I must have missed a book between Primal Fear and Rain In Hell because I don't remember the girl getting hurt in Primal Fear. All and all, OK book, would recommend to others."
2,Diehl--a hardware illiterate!,"The Right-wing gun totin' redneck had ""The Turner Diaries"" and now the Left-wing, Perrier sippin', veggie-bar visitin', Mandaring class elitist has ""Reign in Hell"". If Diehl is going to write about the milita movement; which he seems to portray as Bible-thumping Bigots, then he would be well served to learn a little about the tools of the trade. Most of his errors regarding weapons and weapon nomenclature would be laughable if only they were not so completely inane. My personal favorite is when the US Rangers are staging their air assault on the militia enclave and: ""Sgt Williams stepped off the Pavelow troop helo with a 30mm Gatling gun whirling and spitting in his enormous arms."" Folks, they better be enormous, the 30mmGAU only weights 1100 pounds! Each round of ammo for that beast is a little over a pound each with the Depleted Uranium Projectiles. Mr. Diehl, if you want people to take you serious, get your facts straight. END"
4,Read it for Vail and not for Stampler,"I couldn't agree more with all of the reviews of ""Reign in Hell"" already placed upon this website. This is quite an intriguing novel because of its involvement with current events involving religious cults and/or militia groups. However, for those who are drawn to this novel because of its inclusion of Aaron Stampler, it is quite a disappointment. At the beginning of the book, we are led to believe that Aaron will play a major role in the novel when, in fact, he simply does not (Why he couldn't have played a bigger role, I don't know. So much could have been done with his newfound identity. Also, the build-up to the ending is terrific but the resolution happens too fast with little satisfaction for those following the Vail-Stampler rivalry.). With all of this in mind, this book is quite entertaining. If you've read Diehl's previous two novels, read it for Martin Vail, not for Aaron Stampler. Doing so will enhance the enjoyment of this novel."
2,Do your homework Diehl,"Diehl should not be writing on extreme religions when he clearly knows nothing about religion period. Does Diehl honestly believe that Mormon elders wear bush beards? Having Aaron come back was ludicrous, a desparate attempt to find a place for him while he basically had no role in the story. THe first 2 books were good, this one is crap."
2,Oh Come On,"I am a bit disappointed in the author after reading this book, I just have zero patience for books that are this cheesy. He should have used more of his skills to actually put together a story tat was not so Hollywood. The book seams rushed, almost like the author did not want to take the time to really develop either the story or the characters. I just did not believe the characters. I kept waiting for it to get better which is why I toughed it out to the end, but I was disappointed overall.With that said I did find that the book is a fast paced action book. For me it was disappointing, because there is nothing new here except maybe the name, the plot is so predictable. This is mindless pulp fiction, if that is what you are after then this is the book for you."
2,High expectations. Much disappointment,"I enjoyed Primal Fear and was looking forward to the last book about Aaron Stampler - Reign in Hell. It was even on the best seller rack of the paperbacks..Disappointing. Too many characters. Too hard to identify who was who, and I am not sure what all this action was all about."
1,A truly terrible book,"This was the first book by William Diehl I've read and, judging by the comments posted here by his fans, it will definately by my last. If his fans think this book is only slightly worst than his best, I will stear clear of this author.This book can't even win praise as a cheap summer read. The characters are insipid, the plot is ludicrous and the tie-in with Stampler is contrived. Worst of all, the book is so bad it just isn't any fun to read. For far better summer fare, read anything by Thomas Harris (Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs) or Scott Turow (Presumed Innocent, Sins of the Father)."
2,A huge disappointment,"I just recently read this after having read the two previous Martin Vail books several years ago. Overall, I would not recommend it. It does a poor job of advancing anything from the previous two stories and in fact, the book would not have been any different had the Martin/Aaron characters not even been in it. Overall, it almost felt like a 'I want to retire but want one more big payday' type of book, which is a shame.As others have mentioned - a lot of the details that are provided are just plain wrong. I realize that I might have more of an eye for this as a soldier - but I start to feel like 'if the author took shortcuts with this, what else is there?' If you are going to write a book about conflict between militias and soldiers - at least learn the equipment.Also - many of the additional characters that were added were complete stereotypes and never really seemed to have any depth.Overall - a poor effort that I cannot recommend in good faith."
2,Could have been better,This book could have been better. I thought it was pretty lame how Aaron Stampler was brought into the book. A pychotic killer who decides to become a right-wing religous zealot? The only investigative work the FBI did to identify Stampler was dust a car for fingerprints. That was way to easy. The Attorney General was a lame character. She was supposed to be no nonsense. However I found her laughable and was actually glad when she resigned at the end. It's strange how Martin Vail goes from being a weasle of a defense lawyer to such an honest and moral Attorney General.
2,written to be a movie...,"The author's ""Primal Fear"" was a great read in this trilogy, featuring Marin Vail, attorney. Saddly, it's been down hill for Vail and Diehl ever since. ""Rein in Hell"" reads like a promo for a movie contract. Absolutely no characted development. Scene--dialogue--scene--dialogue--scene--dialogue. Diehl is a good writer. I sense there were people around him pushing for this weak effort. He should avoid Hollywood and stay on St. Simons Island. It's better for the soul!"
3,To have it repaired is a nightmare.,"I have had one for a year and for the last 3 months it just statred shutting off, I don't know if it is a overheating problem or not, also my cd drive will not open by pushing the eject button I have to use a paper clip.. To have it repaired is a nightmare."
1,Averatec Engineering needs time.,Averatec is a new company and will need time to mature. Be sure to buy a three year service contract. My problems were with the display reliability.
4,"Best balance of speed, HD capacity, and form!","I originally saw this product advertised on ComputerShopper and fell in love. Circuit City seems to have the lowest price but there are a few availability issues depending on where you live. I bought mine from Amazon and it was delivered in less than 2 days with standard shipping! This is perfect for office/student use, NOT for the hard-core gamer. I travel a lot and take lots of digital pictures, so this is perfect in terms of portability and performance.Pros:Small form factorHuge hard driveGreat battery life (avg. 3 hrs)DVD burnerSD/MMC card readerExternal monitor supportCons:No floppy driveNo manual or support documentationNo original discs for installed software (for backup)No IEEE 1394 ports (FireWire)"
2,Only buy if you need a CHEAP laptop,"I have made the mistake of buying two averatecs. The first died within 6 months (and by died, i mean the computer constantly crashed and the power supply would not work properly - it would constantly ""come unplugged"" while the source was plugged in. therefore, my battery was always dead). My second averatec lasted about a year, and the same issues came up. the laptops are simply cheaper than all others...and you pay for what you get...also, averatec customer service is quite possibly the worst i've ever experienced. i think i would rather talk to a telemarketer.only buy this if you are in need of a VERY CHEAP laptop..."
2,Black and Decker Coffee Maker,"This machine works as advertised, but should have been tested by Quality Control people who make their own coffee every morning. The water tank sometimes ""hangs up"" and does not engage the machine properly, but appears to be in correctly. This causes the machine to not start at the programmed time because it thinks it has no water.The fit of the pot under the basket is rough.There is not a positive feel to getting the pot positioned on the machine. If you don't get it just right the pot will not engage the basket valve..The top of the pot is very easy to cross thread as you screw it in..again, who tested this machine?"
3,serves the purpose,I'm not completely happy with this B&D coffeemaker. It doesn't keep my coffee as hot as I'd like it over a 1 to 2 hour period.
1,Incomplete brew cycle,"Shame on Black and Decker! I'm now on my second TCM830 10-cup thermal coffeemaker. First one I had would shut off part way through the brew cycle. After reading the manual over and over I decided to call B&D. They said I would have to package the maker up and send it to them to be repaired. Decided that was too much hassle so I just purchased another one thinking the first one I bought was just a ""bad egg"". To my disappointment the second one I bought worked well for a few months and started doing the same thing. Will not buy another B&D small house appliance. Maybe they need to stick to tools!"
1,Taking Back After One Use,"I bought this to replace my old Black & Decker Thermal Select Plus which I LOVED!!! I paid alot less for this than the $60+ price, but I still hated it. It is slow to pour, slow to brew, is so bulky and strange looking and the pot is difficult to pull out from under the filter holder. I did not like it at all and wish they still sold the Thermal Select."
1,Metallic taste,We purchased two and have had both TCM830 since July 2008. The first cup is good but any remaining coffee in both has a strong metallic taste. Thermal is a good idea but we will go back to glass because of the bad taste.
3,Black & Decker Coffee Maker,Works fine and looks very nice. Little trouble opening lid. Otherwisefine.
3,dissapointed,"As noted elsewhere,the lid of this coffeemaker is impossible to clean...no matter how often you rinse and shake it out there is always trapped water. Also the pot dribbles condensation out of the small holes around the top while it sits on the counter. I have to keep a paper towel under it. The coffee pours slowly..the trade-off is that the pot keeps coffee hot for hours. I can't get the unit to brew strong enough coffee without using a lot more coffee than seems reasonable. On the plus side this unit is attractive and appears to be well built."
4,Not perfect - but well worth it,I purchased this coffee maker after doing a lot of research. It's not perfect - but it is definitely worth the purchase price. Makes a great cup of coffee and keeps it hot (without cooking it) for many hours. Easy to use and thermal is the only way to go! I have been using it daily for approximately 3 weeks. Very satisfied with it's performance so far.
3,CoffeeMaker,Overall product is not as well made as others I have seen.Coffee tastes great in the stainless steel carafe. The carafe is suppose to air dry but is impossible due to water in the rim. The lid of the carafe has almost done a 360 from where it started when first purchased. The coffee grounds container is not well made appears that any pressure on it and it would break. I would not purchase this coffee maker again.
4,Very Nice does everything.,"Black and Decker does a nice job with this coffeemaker. I like the fact that I can add water at the sink, not at the coffeemaker where I usually spill it all over the counter. The stainless steel pot keeps coffee hot for a long time. I was looking for a smaller coffeemaker but decided to just make as many cups as needed. This works well. Then if I plan to entertain I simply make the full pot. Pot keeps the heat and the plate stays cool to the touch. Can't burn your hands."
2,B & D Coffee Thermal Coffee Maker,"I was a little disappointed in the temperature of the coffee. It says that it keeps it very hot for some time but my husband and I both agree that it is cooler than advertised. It is also a pain to get the thermal carafe out from under the brew basket. All in all, I would NOT purchase this product again."
1,Did not last.,"Within a month the ""Brew"" button stuck. The only way to turn it on and off was by banging it the sharp end of a butter knife. After 5 months it leaked. I'm on Amazon right now and even though it would save me money (I already own the gold filter) I'm not going to buy this again."
4,MORE PROS THAN CONS,"Black & Decker TCM830 10-Cup Thermal Stainless-Steel CoffeemakerI PURCHASED MY COFFEE MAKER A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND OVERALL LIKE IT. I FIND IT IS A BIT CLUMSY THOUGH AND SEATING THE POT DIRECTLY UNDER THE SPRING-LOADED COFFEE OUTLET IS A BIT TRICKY. YOU ONLY DO IT WRONG ONCE, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE ENTIRE POT OF COFFEE ENDS UP ALL OVER THE COUNTER IF NOT CORRECTLY PLACED. THE COFFEE ONLY STAYS FAIRLY WARM FOR A FEW HOURS THOUGH I RARELY REMEMBER TO PUT HOT WATER IN THE THERMOS POT TO PREHEAT IT BEFORE BREWING. IT MAKES VERY GOOD COFFEE AND GENERALLY I LIKE IT. IT DESERVES 4 STARS."
2,"Ok, when it brews","It makes a decent cup of coffee and the carafe keeps the coffee warm, not hot, for a few hours but within eight weeks of purchase the machine would fail to fully drain the water in the reservoir. This happens about one in every four times. The carafe also has a poor fit under the basket. I'm looking for a replacement."
4,Good Machine for the money,"I wasn't intending to buy a coffee maker with a thermal carafe because I used to pour the coffee into one immediately after brewing on my old machine. But after extensive research this one had a carafe and a reasonable price. So far after three weeks of more than one pot per day, this machine has done well. Its a little annoying to put the carafe back under the brew basket due to the spring loaded stopper for the pour-while-brewing feature but I wouldn't hesitate recommending the machine for that reason."
4,Makes coffee fast,"Makes coffee fast and tasty. The only complaint I have is that the carafe doesn't keep the coffee warm for long periods of time. The automatic feature works wonderfully, too."
1,Flimsy construction,"My unit never worked right, it consistently turned off before the water reservoir was empty. I ended up disassembling it to determine what the cause was and in the process discovered that this coffee maker, like most other drip units, consisted mainly of cheap plastic castings that fit together rather poorly. That explains the complaints that others have made about difficulty getting the carafe under the drip basket. Anyway, the problem turned out to be the check valve between the reservoir and the heating element. It shut of the water prematurely making the heat sensor think the reservoir was empty. After reassembling the whole thing it still wouldn't work reliably so I ended up sending it back. Coincidentally, the other day I was in Lowe's and saw the same coffee maker for $30 less than the price I paid on Amazon. So if you really want to try this unit, I'd check Lowe's first."
1,Terrible,"This is the worst coffee pot I have ever owned. You have to fight and fight to get the carafe in place as there is basically NO roon between it and the drip valve. No matter how hard you try, coffee grinds seep through into the carafe 50% of the time. And, after one month, the water tank in mine began leaking in the valve area."
3,It's OK not great,"We've had ours for 2yrs. Now I'm shopping for another brand. The coffee does NOT stay warm anymore. Kind of hoping it would have lasted longer. Or, I may just buy a good quality thermos to keep the coffee in after brewing. But either way, it's disappointing. *Keep in mind ~ if you are purchasing this to have hot coffee all day.*One other problem, the digital setting is at the bottom. Spilling things on it is very likely. Making the buttons stick.Also, if you have ANY problem with eyesight... very difficult to see in order to set time / brewing time. I keep a lighted magnifying glass next to it, so I can set it."
2,Good coffee get cold fast!,"This unit makes good coffee, but the stainless steel 'thermos' is almost useless in keeping the coffee warm. One of the features of the maker was supposed to be that the ""Thermal carafe keeps coffee hot and tastefully fresh for hours"", but in reality coffee that has been in the carafe for 30 minutes needs warming. I've had this unit for a year and a half and it's been a disappointment from day one. I should have returned it after the first use."
4,Coffee maker,A great coffee maker. It keeps the coffee fresh and hot for hours. It does not take long to brew and you can sneak a cup if you are anxious for that first cup of coffee.
4,Liked my old Black & Decker better!,"My old Black & Decker had a thermal caraffe with a glass liner. Wow, the coffee stayed hot for over 24 hours. Unfortunately, the glass liner broke, so I tried this coffee maker. This thermal caraffe is stainless steel and does not begin to do as good of a job at keeping coffee hot. Coffee will be noticeably cooler in 1-2 hours. However, the advantage is that there is no glass liner to break. The swing out basket is a little flimsy and awarkward, and the caraffe does not slide smoothly into place when placing under filter. The coffee pours very slowly, almost at a dribble. I do like the removeable reservoir. This coffee maker is attractive to look at and it takes less counter space than my old one. Overall, this coffeemaker is acceptable, but not as good as the old one."
2,Could be better,"I've had B&D; coffeemakers in the past. They were OK Maybe not perfect but just OK. This one however I think is cheaply made and so light weight you have to be careful not to pull the whole thing off the counter top. I would suggest a few dollars more and get something like a CuisinartCuisinart DCC-1150BK 10-Cup Programmable Thermal Coffeemaker, Blackyou even get a gold filter and a water filter.Bill T."
2,Brewing cycle,"I basicly like the coffee maker, the biggest problem is...I fix it to come on the next morning and it does ""but"" I always have to push the ""on"" button at least once maybe twice for the machine to empty the water resevoire, a bit of an aggravation. Correct this and you would have an excellant product."
2,"Quiet, but problems","We recently purchased this for our office. The good points: It's very quiet when it brews, and keeps the coffee warm for a good long time.But it's annoying in several ways. First, the pot doesn't easily fit into the unit without shoving a few times. Also, the top twists to either ""pour"" or ""keep warm,"" and the ""pour"" hardly dribbles. I always end up taking the top off totally to pour it. The top is then hard to get back on, it doesn't sit on the top evenly enough to twist it back on.Now I'm wondering if we shouldn't have shelled out the extra bucks for a higher-quality unit. Maybe we got a lemon?"
1,Unpredictable,"Usually Black and Decker products are reliable. The TCM830, sadly is not. It's barely 6 months old and is failing. The reservoir doesn't completely empty thus making the perfect pot of coffee somewhat challenging. You need to be wide awake when positioning the carafe under the brew basket; else, you'll have a counter top full of coffee. I'm shopping for a replacement."
4,Rather well-done coffee maker,"This unit replaced a similar Cuisinart unit which had failed. We were looking for a thermal carafe and 10-cup capacity. Black and Decker seems to have gotten most things right with this unit, such as the removable reservoir and a straightforward design.Since I grind my own coffee, I found the #4 Mellita-style filters took some getting used to (i.e., getting the grounds into the filter without spillage). Also, the valves on the bottom of the filter bail and the top of the carafe don't slide across each other easily, so some fiddling was necessary until we got used to them.Perhaps most important (and rarely mentioned in these reviews) is that we chose Black & Decker for its reputation for longevity; When we chose the TCM830, we had in mind an older B&D; coffee maker (non-thermal-carafe) from 10 years ago which still works like it did out of the box."
4,Coffee Pot,"My husband had a coffee pot just like this and it broke. He kept looking and looking for one just like the one he had. He spent hours driving and looking starting at the store where we purchased the first one, to no avail, he was not happy. I just got on Amazon and it took about 1- 1 /12 hours and there it was. It was a lot more then what I paid at the store but to see his face it was worth the price.... Thanks to you he can make more coffee..lol.."
1,Black & Decker design flaws,"As stated by another reviewer this coffeemaker, after about 9 months of making the best coffee I've ever had, stops brewing mid-pot. I have 4 of them (3 being replacements) and all 4 stopped at approximately the same amount of time. I need this last one replaced and even though Black & Decker told me that they were aware of the problem, they have yet to fix it and expect me to pay full price for a new one.They offered it to me for $105. I paid $45 for the original one. Anyhow I will now be shopping for another coffeemaker with the same features I love. Stainless steel pot and the ability to pour while still brewing. I just wish it would continue to work like it should. We even still have a Mr. Coffee from the 1970's that brews but the coffee tastes horrible."
2,Not satisfied.,"I purchased this coffeemaker for my husband for Christmas. I'm not a coffee drinker, so I wouldn't know a good one from a bad one. I loved the way this one looked and read reviews and didn't read anything bad enough to make me decide I didn't want to buy it. My husband didn't enjoy it. He tried not to hurt my feelings by not saying anything to me, but I could tell he wasn't impressed. After nudging him long enough he admitted the coffee was weak and he had to add so much coffee to it to make it strong enough that it was wasting money. That was enough for me! I sent it back. Haven't gotten a refund yet, but I am hopeful I will."
2,Nice concept but unfortunate performance,"I should have listened to the negative reviews more closely. Some of the features were interesting but turned out to be a little clumsy ergonomically. The larger issue, however was coffeemaking. It is well known that good coffee is produced at a temperature between 190 and 205 degrees F for the full brewing cycle. Too low and the result is bitterness as the flavors aren't extracted properly. This machine consistently registered 165 degrees with a surge to about 190 in the last minute or so. Not enough. Amazon Prime didn't have the item a month or so ago so I purchased it from a partner, Design Concepts. They were nice enough to let me return the unit.I would suggest buying a 25.00 Black and Decker coffee maker (they work fine) and saving your money to purchase a 300.00 Technivorm, described elsewhere by Amazon. It will last indefinitely and is the only drip machine to produce really great coffee. Worth the money."
2,Not worth the money,"Right down to specifics. The plastic water reservoir does not stay open easily while filling (plastic lid wants to close on you). After owning this machine one year (most expensive I have ever bought) the water doesn't heat up enough. It stops running before all the water is through the system, leaving a cup in the reservoir. The thermos gets cold quickly if its a cold day out (isn't the point to keep it warm??). Would not recommend nor buy another at this price."
3,Happy mommy,We got this as a back up to the one we already had because my daughter has claimed this as her stuffed animal of choice to sleep with. And we needed a back up because we all know what happens if you don't and you loose the first one
1,A wasted effort,"Basic Information.Great Illustrations.BUT!The illustrations are on facing pages,so the middle of the illustrations are lost.Some are on one page and are OK.Very Disappointing.These great illustration are wasted in this format.Would give it minus rating, if possible.Glad I did not pay more."
4,A way to go,One of the lasts old school kung-fu movie...but a great way to go! Yuen biao plays a coward washer boy who somehow gets tangled with a killer. The story is confusing but the martial arts are unique. The scene where the tailor wants to kill master wong fei-hung is a classic that is copy move by move in the new legend of shaolin featuring jet li. The final showdown between biao ad the killer is fascinating as biao proves his ability to jump and move like jackie chan. A must have for all kung-fu old school fans.
2,Not sure why they made a level 2.,"I bought this for my son, since he finished level A early in the semester. I figured it would give him more challenging work, but I was wrong. This is a good book, but I don't believe it adds very much knowledge to a child who can read well. If your child can't read very well, then I would recommend this book, otherwise I think its a waste of money."
1,Badly Designed Junk,This item lasted less than a minute before it failed. The spool cannot be removed and it is basically useless. The poor design call s into question all McCulloch products.
3,It was ok,"My daughter is three and loves Dora and I got this for her, she mostly just plays with the dolls and the boat on her big dollhouse, the tree house we put away. But like every toy it only holds the childs attention for a little while. But all in all she enjoyed it."
1,paTHETIC!,"I would say it sounds like a garage band, but I can't think of a garage that deserves the abuse! First, the audio sounded VERY tinny. Mickey talked (and often too much!) about what a nice venue it was. Obviously, he did not listen to himself sing.I am still a fan of the old group when all the originals were there. I am getting real sick of these revenue generating, no talent telethon type concerts for the broke.Enough said.lare"
3,hoped for better,"I did not really like this DVD at all. I had to give it a 3 star beacause I was trying to be nice. One of the songs that I've loved stunk big time! The song was ""Fooled Around And Fell In Love"" I have alot of music DVD's over 150 and this DVD has to be one of the least favorite to date that an ""America"" I hope to help in peoples decison in saving money in buying bad DVD's."
4,Robust reviews and realistic recommendations,"The author presents frank food reviews of several dining establishments in various Asian countries. Being a vegetarian, I find it scary to order food in countries where I don't have a good command of the language and have trouble communicating the fact that I don't want to eat meat. This guide would encourage me. Plus, there's always the chance that a restaurant manager or owner will say there is no meat in a dish (even if there is) just to please the foreign visitor. This guide is helpful and shows off the author's wit. Plus, there are the nicely illustrated Bonus Animals which showcase the beautiful creatures in that part of the world."
3,"Good topic, bad writing","Providing an abundance of evidence that many academics can't write, Harcourt displays his lack of talent in Illusion of Order. That said, the topic is fascinating and his critique of ""broken windows"" policing is blistering. Read it for the substance; just be prepared to wade through the pretty awful style."
1,Volume Demonstrates Why Academics Are So Often Disregarded,"(1) Speaking as a former police supervisor, criticisms of the ""Broken Windows"" Theory of policing are often well taken. Unfortunately, Bernard Harcourt couches his oppositional views in a rambling, inefficiently written academese. Concise, telling points are few. The bibliography is decent. (2) Timothy Lynch's ""'We Own the Night' Amadou Diallo's Deadly Encounter with New York City's Street Crimes Unit"" makes a much more effective argument in only 8 pages. (Cato Institute Briefing Papers #56). George Kelling, the National Institute of Justice, and the New York Office of the Attorney General have all produced shorter, precise, and much more telling analyses of some of the pros and cons of Broken Windows doctrine."
1,Look at author before you look at book.,"I finally finished this book, but it wasn't easy. While Mr. Harcourt tries to show that New York (and other cities) is not any safer than it was before the Mayor began his programs I have to say it just doesn't wash. He uses the one thing to try and prove his point that just wont work and that is his own opinion. When you live in a world when all you have ever done is work in and around colleges/schools you lose a grip on the real world. Much like other ""Professional Writers and/or Professors"" Mr. Harcourt has watched too many liberal TV reports and read the Village Voice to often. The Cops make mistakes, but when crime rates all over the US are going down and many departments are following the Broken Windows Theory something must be working."
4,A Superb Collection of Stories,"Peter Dawson, along with his brother, Luke Short, created and published some of the finest books ever written about the American West. This collection focuses in on the years between 1936 and 1947, all published in the pulp western magazines of the day. They are vintage stories with typical plots, yet each has a character you will not forget--a deputy sheriff, a blacksmith, a doctor, etc. Each story is told with realness and plenty of action to keep you turning the pages. Typically, personally, I like novels over short stories, but these stories are filled with enough characterization and plot to keep me interested. It is indeed a shame Peter Dawson--Jonathan Hurff Glidden--did not write more novels as I think they are his best work, but these are worth the price of a book to have to read for yourself so you can enjoy his genius and entertaining short story telling."
5,It will help you focus on a more specific view,"This is a terrific book and helps as a way of refocusing the view of how you think about the culture described in the Book of Mormon. If you are a believer, ... it helps to make things more specific and yet less cut and dried. Just like real life.If you aren't a believer, and in fact if you actively disbelieve the Book of Mormon, that is OK too. You will get a more specific look at the vision of things you actively disbelieve.In either case it is a helpful and valuable book, as are all of Sorenson's works."
4,A delightful composition with a spirited performance,"The beauty of the second pizzicato movement of the Ravel Quarter in F Major alone will justify the cost of this CD. To my shock (and slight dismay), you may recognize this movement from the recent movie ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". Not a bad recording at all either."
5,Dave does it again,"This is a beautiful acoustic album. Mixing influences of Asian/Middle Eastern rhythms and cord changes with progressive rock leanings, the piece never faulters or begins to run dry. Being a tremendous Polvo fan, it's also interesting to discover just which sounds Dave contributed to thier rock landscapes. Check this record out if you enjoy japanese noh music, Sonic Youth's experimental ep's or Sandy Bull."
3,Lame,"This game looked like it would be fun in the packaging, but the game had no manuals. The graphics are bad, sound is off-cue, and I wouldn't buy this again."
4,Genie and her theory of men...,"I was wishy washy about getting this book, but once I started to read this book it was GOOD! I loved the theory Genie had with men, but once David came on the scene he changed her way of thinking. In my opinion I think David was just bored with his dead end marriage and he saw something interesting in Genie. He wasn't as serious about her as she was about him. I didn't really like David's character because he was unsure of what he wanted. The ending to this book really suprised me....I was like WHAT!!!"
2,Very Dissapointing!!!,"This book started out slow, and stayed that way!!! A true waste of time and money..The only good thing about this book was the attractive book cover!"
3,Had the potential to be a lot better....,"In the beginning of this novel, Patty Rice introduces the main character (Genie Gatlin) as a woman who sees straight through men and the games they play and uses them as a tool for her own gain. Later on the author shows the reader that Genie's nonchalant, loveless attitude for men is actually a lifestyle she's chosen because of her pass. Ultimately, Genie is heartbroken and and realizes that she needs to change her self-destructive behavior. Overall I enjoyed this book. It was really well written. It was set in the DC Metro area (where I live). Although I liked this book, I think the author could have given us a more detailed picture of Genie getting her life back together rather than focusing so much on her pain and struggle. I was satisfied with the ending but I would liked to have seen more of the events leading up to it. You'll see what I mean if you decide to read this one. I don't want to give it away. Happy Reading!"
4,This was something extra,"Ms. Rice did a good job of giving you an idea of what a woman is feeling as she is running around with a married man. My only problem is that Genie gets so obsessed with being with David that she can't see when it was time to let go. All of the promises he made to her were just that--promises. The book is filled with constant action. The only thing that got old was Genie's constant whining (I mean pining) over David. She really needed to get a grip and let it go. Everyone has experienced what may be their best love but once you part ways, go through your ""mourning period"" and then start your new life. She practically drove herself crazy trying to get him back. Genie really needed to recognize when it was time to throw in the towel. All in all, I would recommend this book to my friends. It is a page turner!"
5,Somethin Extra is Right!,"Ms. Rice did an excellent job on this project. I really did not want this book to end! Every time Genie spoke I was all eyes, because what she had to say seemed so realistic. The social issues touched on in this book were all too real. I thought all the characters were well developed. I enjoyed this book from the beginning to the very end!"
1,What does love have to do with it.,"I just could not get all the way to the end. I was sick and tired of the whinning. I truely did not care if they got together, stayed together or just walked away. Ms. Rice failed to make me care about the charactors. The book went on and on forever. I have tried three times to make it to the end of this book but I CAN NOT DO IT."
3,Islam,This book is informative but it is boring. It is doesn't draw me in with a catching introduction so it is not fun to read. This was required text for my religious studies class- Islam.
4,Iran,This text book is great for someone who wants to learn about Islamic doctrines. The author of the book is mostly discussing Sunni sect and at some point referes to Shi'ite Muslim in Iran.
2,Disappointed,Got it for my son at xmas. Doesn't talk! And it broke within two months. Dis-appointed with this item... Cheap quality.
5,Herb Alpert and TJB in their prime,"I was raised listening to the TJB so I am prejudiced toward their playing. That said, this is an excellent example of the ""old"" TJB type of playing--simple, bouncy, uplifting. The TJB have a style that is unique and I never tire of hearing them. I have been listening to this album since it was an LP, back in 1968, and I still pull it out every spring to listen to it again. Long live Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass!"
5,The Beat of the Brass=Bossa Nova,"The Beat Of the Brass is the soundtrack for The Tijuana Brass' second television special. It features Alpert's first number one hit, as a vocalist. This Guy's In Love With You, written by Burt Bacharach, is the last track on the album.The Beat of the Brass' opener is Monday Monday. A swinging rendition of The Mamas & The Papas hit. After this track, the album goes into a string of tunes with a bossa nova beat. Cabaret, and Panama are the high lights of the first set of brazilian influenced tunes. Talk To The Animals, a rather corny number isn't the best song on the album.Track seven, Slick is another swinging piece, and the second string of bossa novas starts off again, until the album comes to a close with the vocal.The original album had a gatefold cover displaying scenes from the special they did for NBC, and very nice pictures. This is a very tight album, with excellent instrumentation. A wonderful album!"
1,NOT WORTH IT!!,"This is a very short and uninspired piece of writing. It is not the music. It might be worth $0.30 or $0.45, but I can't imagine to whom."
3,More typical commercial hardrock of the era.,"There was a video for the song ""standing"" in the Metal Mission video that was catchy. After their 1st album on Pure Metal, Under The Ruins, they swayed from the melodic metal angle to a more commercial hardrock sound. In the early 90s this band was already outdated as the grunge wave swept."
4,The best Q&A Review out there!,"This is the best book out there as far as how questions are written. I threw out a Mosby book before this one; it was terrible. I did 5,000 questions total to pratice for boards, using Saunders Comprehensive Review and this book and passed my boards in 75 questions on the first try. The Saunders questions were most like ""the real thing"" compared to other books I used.I was disappointed that this book only had 1700 questions in the text itself; the CD-ROM had 3,000, but they duplicated the ones in the book, so if you did the book first and then the CD, you got repeats. It would be better if the CD only had new questions on it and not the ones in the book.If you are prepping for your board exams, don't be mistaken--you have to do the content review FIRST. This book is for after you have reviewed your content and just want to practice questions."
2,Q&A Review for NCLEX Saunders,The book is okay and I do like having the rationales right next to the questions. However I got the Dosage and Calculations CD instead of the RN review CD. I havn't taken my NCLEX yet and am not having much luck reaching the publishier to replace my CD.
4,One of the best NCLEX-RN review book!,"This book really help me prepare for the boards. I would suggest not to bother with the book because they had the rationales right next to the questions so it was quite annoying. However, the cd-rom was great. The exam format and questions are similar to the NCLEX exam. I highly recommend this for practicing Q & A's."
2,"Book is good, CD ROM is not","Out of all the review books I have read, this one definitely has the best format, and the questions are very good preparation for the NCLEX exam. However, in my experience, computerized review questions are the most beneficial for me as I get close to exam time. Unfortunately, I chose to focus on the accompanying CD ROM for my last two weeks prior to the test, and was immobilized by continuous and ongoing error messages, crashes, and loss of data."
1,Disappointed in purchase,"It has been over 30 days and I have not recieved Saunders Q&A; review for NCLEX-RN. The seller maniseprince, took payment upon purchase , has not responded to my email request as to a delivery date. I made three purchases on Jan. 30, 2008 the above mentioned is the only one I do not have.If I had the text I would gladlu review it!New memeber, disappointment."
1,Way too vague,"If you want to know how to take care of your tropical fruit you won't learn it here! If you want to see pictures of citrus fruit, that you will see. I have pineapple plants along with banana, mango, orange, key lime, tangerine, and papaya trees. This book was worthless to me. I already know what they look like."
5,The Ultimate Citrus How-To Book,"This book, recommended by a botanist friend is just the ticket for answering our questions about caring for our citrus trees. Great resource."
4,Her Shake - Power Pop Heaven,"As already mentioned here, ""Her Shake"" is an absolute classic - sort of a stripped-down Crenshaw taken into overdrive. It has other great follow-ups (like ""Said Don't Go"") - plus one I normally skip (""Lovebug"")."
4,"Solid guitar pop,","Blue Pop's a fine little record, though I can't really justify the comparisons to a real master like Tommy Keene that others here have made. Daniel lacks Keene's real gift for inventive, complex hooks and arrangements. He also lacks Keene's affinity for Power Pop of the 70's, there's more Posies here than Raspberries--more fuzzed vamping than interesting pop guitar. Certainly not a bad thing, and 'Battle Song' is terriffic, but there's a bit more soft-voice-hurt-ex-boyfriend stuff here for my taste; 'Simple Things' is almost too fey to stand."
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this combo after reading the reviews and after my friend recommended it for my heat damaged dry, thin hair. My hair was naturally silky and straight before I damaged it with straightener. I wanted to get my original hair look with this. First use it was good, after few washes I didn't see any major difference. My hair was still dry and not sleek. My friend still swears by it and I like how her hair looks(hers is very thick and long) after blow drying. I decided not to buy anymore of this one, may be its not for thin, flat, dry hair. Herstyler shampoo conditioner combo from amazon worked for my hair so I totally switched to it."
5,Amazing!!!,"I am an african american woman with all natural hair (never had a perm,color, chemicals, etc) so everyone KNOWS how natural african american hair looks and operates! Istantly, after using this product, my hair was trasnformed straight just from BLOW DRYING. With 6 months (good things come to those who wait!) my hair was totally different. It was more straight after washing, and looked like I had (half a$$ed) flat iron it just after blow drying. Once I applied a little heat to it (curlers, flat iron, etc) my hair was sooo straight, it had so much body, my hair has grown significantly, it is well moisturized, etc. This is the only product I will use for the rest of my life. I have never been so pleased! <3"
4,great combo,I've been looking for a hair product that can tame my unruly hair. I've tried a whole bunch and they just didn't do the job. I've read some reviews on this and I thought I'll give it a try. Glad I did. It doesn't feel heavy and and leaves my hair looking much tamer then before. The smell is not bad and the price is just right.
1,Worst Matrix product ever!,"Where do I start? It is such a contradiction to its name. My hair became ultra frizzy and unmanageable after using this product. The irony is that my hairdresser recommended it to me because of frizz! My hair started falling after starting on this shampoo-conditioner regimen and I am stuck with this huge bottle (my bad!) for the next three months. In my defense, I trusted this product blindly because of the Matrix tag. From now on, I am going to stick to Biolage. That is the best hair product I've ever used on my hair!And oh yes, I am going to change my hairdresser too."
3,the shampoo could not wash the oil treatment out.,I'm still using it and its made a difference in how easily the flat iron glides through my hair. And it leaves the texture more soft and manageable.
5,Harley & Muscle Make The Best Mix CD's,"This is the best mix of the After Dark mix series. The coolest track on the CD is by Karu. Check out the ""Amazing Place"" CD for producer Quentin Allen as Karu. There are other 12"" releases on Silver Network, Dadhouse, Winding Road, Mimosa & Smooth Agent. This CD is a very consistant production with a good blend of jazz, hip-hop, techno, neo-soul, and deep house all together. The beats are very crisp and sound good in the car, the house or the club. Some songs tastefully use vocal snippets to add flavor. There is even a track featuring Warren Harris aka Hanna (Shadow Records, Silver Network, Flat & Round, Freerange). If you want good quality deep house, this CD is for you."
4,Kinkysweet does it again,"With all of the different compilation CDs on the market, sometimes you just want to put something in your CD player while driving or sitting at home and relax. Growing up in Chicago, I am use to house and love, but that does not mean I want to listen to it at home. Grown up, adult-like, and can be played anywhere, Kinkysweet continues to churn out music that is palatable for anyone."
5,House Music,I enjoy this music but do not live the lifestyle anymore. For anyone who can't get enough of the sound but their lives demand more attention. I recommend all of these AFTERDARK compilations.
2,disappointing,"I really love the Afterdark and Bargroove cds, but was highly disappointed in this 2 cd set. Sure, its relaxing and the music is smooth and all that but I'd rather pop in one of those great Bargroove cds to get my night going."
3,Creative Tool For Child Therapists,"This book has many creative and engaging activities to use with children in therapy. The activities can be used with many treatment populations and settings. Readers may also be interested in the following books:Creative Interventions for Troubled Children & YouthMore Creative Interventions for Troubled Children and YouthAssessment and Treatment Activities for Children, Adolescents, and Families: Practitioners Share Their Most Effective Techniques101 Favorite Play Therapy Techniques, Vol. 3"
3,This movie doesn't do Gary Daniels' justice.,"I have a good majority of Gary Daniels' films. This is the second movie that he plays the bad guy. Unfortunately, he does not get enough screen time; but then again, this movie doesn't do him justice. He is one of the two leading roles, and they do more talking about his character than you actually see his character. For example--his character is supposed to be a real evil guy and the main nemesis, yet you get more insight to all the other bad-guy characters more than you do Gary's character. And for a martial arts film, you hardly see him practicing and/or fighting. Gary should have turned down the role!!"
2,"Not a bad premise, but miserably presented","Here's Keith Cooke playing Chance O'Brien, world kickboxing champion in a future not many years hence. A new generation of fighters sporting a variety of cybernetic enhancements is coming up, certain of their superiority. To prove which corporation manufactures the most advanced cybernetics, a no-holds-barred tournament is held where every fight is to the death, and Chance is the only competitor who's purely human. This is an idea with potential. But it's so badly executed, and the ending is such a complete waste, that it's a total embarrassment.This can be laid soley at the feet of the writer/director. The actors all turn in creditable performances, but they're fighting an uphill battle. Don't bother with this movie."
3,*okay* flick,its a good action fightin flick for martial arts fan... myself a winner of the u.s. tae kwon do national championship... this movie reminded me of the glory of winning =) .. i just had to say jet li would win this any day... i'm a hardcore jet li fan.... sorry.. =) good job keith!
1,Jeepers Creepers rip off!,"This movie is such a huge rip off of the two Jeepers Creepers films. The only difference is the cheesey nudity and believe me, it's ugly nudity. The only reason I gave it ONE star is two fold: first I can't put down zero stars; and second there were some funny lines in it."
1,Scarecrow Gone Wild,"Scarecrow Gone Wild should have never gotton a go ahead. The primise may seem like a good horror movie type plot. Lousy acting and actors can't enhance a horrible script.My only reason for purchasing this movie, I'm a fan of Olivia Munn =). I've met and she's always nice to me, sadly she's only in the movie a few seconds.Olivia was probably the only real actress / actor in the movie.If you like bad a horrible horror film you may enjoy Scarcrow Gone Wild.Let me know if you can watch this movie more than once."
1,This was just silly,"I watched this for the heck of it on cable last night, and thought that perhaps I should have tried to throw darts at the moon instead. I would have had better luck hitting the moon than enjoying this film.Not all slasher films are bad, if you're into them. I'm not a huge fan of them, but there are the few exceptions that stand above the rest.The main problem with this film - and there were many - was that the scarecrow looked and walked like Jason from Friday the Thirteenth. We saw silly and inexplicable nudity, a brother who promised to show up at an emergency facility but never came (and this was never commented on), stupid guys, stupid girls...you get the drift."
4,a good low budget film,"cheesy title makes it appear as if this film is nothing but a softcore flick. it is definately not one of those films. This horror flick had a lot of heart to it. You feel for the characters and they don't annoy as much as most films in this genre tend to do.By the end of the film I was left satisfied. Once you think the film is over, there is an added twist that continues the film with the surviving characters still running from the Scarecrow.Good story line, decent effects, effective characters. It was an entertaining film, it's worth checking out. certainly better than most big budget horror flicks.This is a title that will probably be overseen but should get noticedIt doesn't dissapoint"
1,This movie is the weakest link,"The third installment in the Scarecrow series has more problems than a child star from Different Strokes. While the previous two films, Scarecrow and Scarecrow Slayer were action packed and sprinkled with humor, this film lacks both.The `story' is nearly non-existent. It seems the director attempts to cover this fact by having every woman in the movie take their tops off, but not even that can distract from the horrible rendition of the Scarecrow. In the previous films, I found the costume and make-up to be original, convincing, and scary. This time, the Scarecrow is obviously just a guy in a burlap sack with a Halloween mask so cheap you can see his skin around the eye holes.And don't even ask how the acting was. The best actor in the film is Ken Shamrock. That says most of it right there.While I enjoy bargain basement horror films, this one should have stayed in the basement. Please check out some of the other, older films York has to offer instead."
3,"Okay, but Monotonous","No, Salieri was neither evil nor murderous. No, his music was not bad, but at the same time it wasn't as good as some people make it out to be. The overtures on this disc are individually all right in their way, but an even dozen of them heard one after the other is a bit of overkill. Most rely on repetition and crescendo to make a point, and while in small doses that's fine, once you've heard a couple the novelty fades rather quickly. If you'd like to sample this composer's output, I think the best place to start is a release from Chandos by the London Mozart Players under Matthias Bamert. You get three overtures equal to or better than the ones on the Naxos disc, plus two symphonies (including the engaging ""Venetian"") and the marvelous Variations on La folia. The playing is superior on the Chandos release as well. In the consolation rounds for runners-up to Mozart and Haydn, Salieri is a contender of sorts, but this Naxos disc doesn't give his reputation that much of a boost."
3,Blue Dragon Surfboard pewter pendant necklace,The dragon was black not blue. It was the blue dragon that appealed to me. I had to give it as a gift
4,Osprey is a tease,"As with all the Osprey series, this book is a good teaser. It lacks the expanded detail to be a good resource. However, it is brief enough, with enough visual information to spark interest for further research. This one c ould be avoided for those looking into the earlier period of it, as it concentrates on the 5/6 Centuries."
4,Not for first-timers.,"Sinatra's favorite composer--for both torch songs and swingers--the mightily underrated Van Heusen can't be represented properly by a collection that omits ""Here's That Rainy Day."" Like an Irving Berlin collection without ""White Christmas""!"
5,Easy to install looks nice,When i installed i washed vehicle then used rubbing alcohalto clean surface then i used the cleaning pads warmed the partwith a hair dryer this not coming off and looks great.The fit is perfect.
1,Harmful?,"I just bought this home for my hamster of a year and yesterday, i found him dead in his cage. I just got two new gerbils...but i'm wondering if it was the cage....i also bought the run around and have NO idea how to connect it!"
2,McCulloch model MCT2027 grass trimmer,"When I started to use this tool the plastic debris shield fell off, so I rechecked the User Manual and I appeared to have installed it correctly. It fell off again quite promptly, so I contacted Amazon and they sent another which was similar to the first. The help phone number in the Manual (1-800-521-8550) doesn't connect you to McCulloch, but to a different company, Dixie Sells, where I was told that McCulloch exists only as a brand name of the Modern Tool & Die Company, which has no 800 number. No one at Dixie Sells knew how to assemble the trimmer, so I was on my own. It turned out that a bent piece of wire enclosed with the tool, but not mentioned in the Manual, is what holds the debris shield onto the tool. Because of the poorly written Manual and the lack of company support, I would not recommend this product."
4,Such a great CD to fall asleep to,"It's goth, it's opera... if you enjoy Arcana, you'll love this, too. Forget that it's from a mastermind of Tolkien black metal, and enjoy."
5,one of the great talents of the 70's,"I never heard of Grin until three years ago, though of course I knew Nils Lofgren from his work with Neil Young. When my brother sent me this CD and I put it on, I couldn't figure out why Grin hadn't been more successful. Some of Lofgren's songs (White Lies, Moon Tears, We All Sung Together) should have been big hits. Maybe he needed a better publicist, or a better record company. The loss was mine, because I spent the first 30 years of my life unaware of this creative and enjoyable music. Lofgren was only in his teens when he recorded some of these songs, but they hold up incredibly well. Now I listen often, to make up for lost time. Highly recommended for all."
5,A near perfect retrospective,"Grin was a fantastic band in the early 1970's, but they never achieved the artistic success they so deserved. Nils Lofgren went on to a solo career that has been only slightly more successful, but this disc showcases the fantastic music that Grin produced. While Nils' guitar work sizzles (listen to ""Moontears"" or ""White Lies""), it can also be very sweet (listen to ""Rusty Gun"" and be awed).This CD has all of the Grin classics save one: ""Direction,"" and if that song was included it would be perfect. Even with that omission the disc deserves 5 stars and it deserves a listen."
4,Grows on me,"Had a couple of Lofgren's solo records in the 70's and rather liked them, and will always hold him in high esteem for his work with Neil, but had never gotten around to listening to Grin, though they've been in my field of view for close to 40 years now. Finally got around to buying this and must admit to being underwhelmed on the first couple of listens. Pleasant, competent, but it took several car trips for me to come around to the rather laid-back, platonic charms of this music. Still can't exactly rave about it, Look What Love Can Do is really the only really killer song, but it continues to grow on me and is certainly a keeper. I'll water it and see if it keeps growing."
2,"Not their best, in my opinion ...","I'd recommend Grin's ""1+1"" cd ahead of this greatest hits cd.If you can find it in print yet, I think that you'll be happierwith it as it also includes ""Sometimes"" and ""End Unkind.""""End Unkind"" has some phenomenal guitar work. ""1+1"" alsoincludes ""White Lies,"" ""Lost A Number,"" and ""Hi, Hello Home"" -all of which are excellent. ""1+1"" also includes the studio(and original) version of ""Moon Tears,"" which is also availableon at least one of Nils' live albums.The songs on ""1+1"" vary according to speed and edge, with somebeing soft and slow while others are full-throttle. But its allgood, basic rock and roll. Good, melodic guitar, and some goodlyrics. If you like Thin Lizzy's ""Jailbreak"" cd, you will finda lot to like on ""1+1.""One other thing: the mp3's, above, are not the ones that I wouldhave chosen in order to sell Grin. The songs I have named in myreview are what I would have used. ""Moon Tears"" is the songthat you are most likely to have heard on the radio."
2,Don't bother,"I purchased this item weeks before an upcoming race we were attending. since it only scans race frequencies I was unable to test the product before the race. Fortunately I brought my old scanner with me because the audio on the Sportstronics Nascar Proscan was very poor. While it was very easy to program and operate,with the noise at the track it was impossible to hear the correspondence between my driver and his team. If the vendor's return policy wasn't so unreasonable, I'd return it today. I don't believe a restocking charge is a fair practice given the product didn't perform as advertised."
1,awful product,"i wouldnt even give this a star,but it wont post if i dont.it was terrible, earbuds kept falling out,hard timegetting the headset on, then they hurt my ears with the ear plugs in, had a hard time finding & keeping my drivers frrequncy, then sometimes i couldnt understand what was being said. was very disapointed in this product. got another headset to go withit, but the sound wont work. wasted time & money on this one!!!!"
5,A rough and tough pick,"This is a great pick at a great value. I easily tore through roots of old stumps, never feeling the tool was going to give at any point. It also worked right through some of our Missouri clay soil that was used as a gravel mound. When I purchased the pick it was a bit cheaper than the $44.68 price, but I think it would still be worth the current price."
5,Fantastic tool,I replaced a wooden handle pick axe with this and I could not be happier. I have very rocky soil and the pick fishes out the boulders and hold it's point even with direct strikes onto stone. I have not stung my hands at all with it either. It is really well balanced and if you have to bust up earth all day this is the tool to use.I recommend it highly.
4,Ames Pick Mattock,"This is a pretty decent mattock. It has held up well to some pretty vigorous use, and is still going strong. I am a fan of the FiberPro handle - it reduces uncomfortable vibrations, and is very durable."
5,Pick mattock,"What can you say about a pick mattock? It works! I especially like the fiberglass handle; I keep my tools in a shed, and the pick i used to have, had the wooden handle eaten by bugs."
1,want to ask a question,I just want to know I have a playstation 3 and a 51 inch panisonic tv can I use these hdmi cables for them
3,Pure Instinct,"I have read the first 3 Instinct series books with Jessica Coran, M.E. I have been ""riveted"" to my seat in all of the books thus far. Pure Instinct didn't seem as good to me because there were so many ""side stories"" involved as well. The introduction of Dr Kim Desinor was the main story as far as I was concerned. The ""Heart"" killer in New Orleans was the main story. But as it turned out, Jessica's closure with Matt Mattisak was really the main event. I was a bit confused with this book but I still enjoyed it. The back & forth between Jessica & Kim got me dizzy & I had to go back a few pages at times. I've rated it 3 stars because Richard Walters' Instinct Series is riveting and his character's backgrounds & life experiences makes me want to meet them. This was the only book at this time that I haven't ""DEVOURED"" in a day. It took me 2-3 days to finish. Bottome line: it is still a good story in all!"
3,"Good Book, but.........","This was a pretty good book, but I am just not liking the main character. I really like the stories but Jessica is starting to get on my nerves. I actually found it refreshing that in this book so much of the story didn't revolve around her. I hope that this new female character remains in the continuing series.Overall, this series is pretty gruesome (serial killers how could they not be) but if you like serial killer books you will enjoy the book. I am thinking that perhaps I shouldn't have started reading them in a row because I am just not crazy about her. If the stories weren't so good I would not continue reading this series."
3,To many uses of the Lords name in vain.,"I'm not easily offended and This could have been a five star novel however, the writers inability to use the thousands of words available in the dictionary to get his point across was a shame. There are plenty of curse words out there without having to use the Lords name in vain numerous times per chapter. It became disgustingly offencive and showed a lower level of education."
4,Heh you guys this would make a great DVD!,Michael Wood just has a great take on presenting history in that certain British way bringing a fuller perspective to old events. This early work shows the fledgling talent just coming out. Other hosts bring about a splendid presentation of class and quality albeit somewhat dated. A real pleasure to watch.
5,Francisco deOsuna: Third spiritual Alphabet,I never thought I would find Osuna's Third Alphabet! and here it is. Translated by Mary E. Giles and with a superb Introduction. She certainly has studied and is familiar with l6th century literature and has a wonderful knowledge of Spain and the times. Thank you for writing such a great book. Her students are very lucky to have been and have her as a teacher.Mariacristina Von Feldt
5,Great blends.,"This cd is dynamic. It blends gut-wrenching howls to beautiful, melodic singing...the same is to be compared with the music. All the tracks on here are amazing, and is hard to pick one that doesn't shine as well as the others. Listening to this cd, I heard a portion of Poison the Well, I swear it. The lead singer has an incredible scream that will love, (if you like screaming.) However, if you're more into singing, I heavily suggest previewing this cd before buying, because there's enough lack of singing that you may not appreciate it. For everyone else, it's a must buy."
5,Favorite CD,"Out of all the cds I own, this one qualifies as one of the Top 5, which says alot. One thing I'm surprised that no one has really touched on is the fact that this is in essence a CONCEPT album. Look at the artwork, read the lyrics... then come back and tell me what you think."
5,Perfect,"What a great cd. Nothing is more hardcore, nothing is more emotional, nothing is more melodic. If that's what your looking for, buy this album.Peace..."
3,3stars only,To bad this is a great bad if U like a freaking headache from SCREAMO! I loved Magnetic North. What the hell guys? Mix it Up alittle & lets understand what u're trying to tell Us! Peace
4,solid release,"I had never heard this band, but was craving something new. Thankfully, I picked this up. Hopesfall combine quite a few elements of hardcore/posthardcore. Most of the guitar work is layered and melodic, with vocals that bounce between screams and sung. I don't mind screamed vocals, but I am very picky about them. This is a perfect balance. I think that one of the guys from HUM produced this album, and the music/guitars are very HUM inspired (a more hardcore HUM?). Even guest vocals by.....the singer from HUM on the 2nd to last song. The sticker on the front of this album sold me - ""for fans of Cave In, HUM, and Thursday"". Usually the sales sticker on the front of a CD lets me down, but this time, I found a great album."
4,acoustic guitar minimalism,"This release will appeal to anyone who appreciates quiet guitar-driven music. Overall this is an ambient album on the verge of being minimal rock. It brings to mind Joy Division/early New Order, Labradford, Brian Eno, Stars of the Lid and Erik Satie. The music itself is very repetitive and entrancing. Highly recommended to listeners who appreciate any of the aforementioned artists/bands."
2,This is NOT REALLY the best of Bob Wills...,"If you are new to Bob Wills, you should know that this album title is a lie. These recordings were made in Nashville toward the end of Bob's life, and they do not capture the authentic sound of Bob Wills and HIS TEXAS PLAYBOYS.The good stuff was recorded from 1935 to 1947 WITH HIS TEXAS PLAYBOYS. If you want the best of Bob Wills, buy something (anything) on Columbia or CBS. I also recommend Tiffany Transcriptions Volumes 2 and 3, but know that even those great albums are not his original classic Texas Playboys. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of his recordings on MGM or MCA."
4,"Good, but you could do better, part 1","This is basically a good collection of wonderful music by this ahead-of-his-time performer. The tracks are great, and the old recording sound is authentic without being annoying. However, the disc--like many of its contemporaries--is not as amply filled as some more recent CD productions. So, while it's not bad for the price, two other discs--""King of Lonestar Swing"" and ""The Essential Bob Wills""--offer a lot more music, meaning, of course, that some of the good stuff on those discs is not contained on the ""Best of Bob Wills."" I would recommend this disc for collectors who want to own all of the Bob Wills CDs or for fans who find a track here that might not be available on the two more generous discs named above."
4,Southern!,"A friend gave me this book for my birthday, and I love it! I've cooked from it twice already and I can't stop looking at the pictures! They remind me of learning to cook with my mother when I was a little girl."
4,"Well Written,Easy and Very Tasty Recipes!","I could not wait to receive this book in the mail and the day that I received it I had to try one or two of the recipes. This book gives it to you straight. No fancy namby pansy ingredients that you have to search for. This is real southern cooking at it's best. Loved this book and will value it's recipes forever. This book can make you a hit cook at any reunion, party or any food occasion that you might attend."
5,Great Chukkas,These boots are super comfortable and not too heavy. Already feel broken in after first wear. Fit true to size.
4,Clarks Originals Men's Desert Boot (Beeswax),"Comfortable and fashionable for the fall months, what more can you ask for? The Desert Boot should be a staple in every man's fall wardrobe. On me they seem to run a little big, so I might try a half size smaller on the next pair I purchase.Clarks Originals Men's Desert Boot"
4,Not Too Bad,"Only problem is the 10.5 fits me while I am size 11.5, but the back hurts my heel after a while."
4,clarks,really nice shoes but the only thing is they get scuffed really easily and by that i mean that if you drop something on the shoe or hit it against something or scratch it it will lose its original brownish color and turn light brown or yellowish. they still look good and it gives them sort of a old worn vintage look but it still kind of bothered me. other than that they are awesome shoes and i would recommend them to anyone
3,waaahhh!,"even more than a size too long does not fit across instep/ball if foot. what happened to my feet or these shoes? I lived in these back in the 70s, so comfortable. so sad :-("
3,red rubber sole,"I, too wore the original desert boot nearly exclusively when dressed casually. From the mid 1950'z unfil the 1980's I wore deser boots, but, as far as I am concerned, after 1970 the ""original"" shoe was no longer available in any part of the U.S. where I happened to be. No one seems to remmber that the original shoe had red rubber soles NOT crepe soles that carry damp dirt with them. Once, in 1985 or so, Nordstrom ordered a pair from the factory with the rubber soles, and those were the last I could find. The ones with the crepe soles are okay, but not nearly the shoe before Clarks decided to use the cheaper crepe sole."
5,my husband's aching feet,"my husband has a hard time finding shoes that will stand up to the rigorous test of shopping with me, and these do!! they are still the most comfortable desert boot he has found."
4,TRUE TO SIZE,"after reading countless reviews that stated that these boots ran large by 1/2 to 1 size , I ordered a half size smaller. They were too small! I take a size 9 in everything and a size 9 is what fit in these boots. NOT a 8.5 like was recommended. I think people are confusing the loose ankle fit to being a size too large. This is the style of the boot. They are minimal in design, no interior padding. Sloppy on the ankle, secure in the middle, true to length. Expect this before buying. Comfort is 3 stars, style is 5. Not recommended for anyone who will stand all day."
3,Solo una cosa mala,En apoyo a un Amazon en spanish.. El producto perfecto.. pero me entregaron los zapatos de otros colores a los que había pedido.. no hubo problemas porque igual le gustaron a la persona del regalo.. pero igual no es el hecho. los pedí de un color marrón que había en existencia y llegaron en grises y según el vendedor no había en el almacén
4,"Great Shoes ,BUT","Great shoes, but I had to return them. It seems that they only make themin a medium width. I called the shipper who called Clark's and that is what they were told. You can get them in various lenght's,but only one width. There's something wrong with this picture. The reason for four stars instead of five is due to only one width selection."
4,Excellent price,"You won't find a price this good anywhere. Even after months of use, they still look great with jeans or khakis."
5,Clark's Mens Desert Boots,"This is a very nice product. My normal size is a 9M, and that's the size I ordered. They fit perfectly. The shipping, as is usually the case with Amazon, was super fast."
5,Comfortable Shoe,"I purchased these desert boots in taupe for my son who said they are comfortable and go with everything. They do run big - I originally got a 10 because reviews warned they run big and he usually wears a 10 1/or 11, but I had to return those and I got a 9 1/2 and they fit fine."
3,Clarks Desert Boots...Size,"I followed the advice of the comments on as far as size they run big...not the case for me, I wear a 9, so I bought a 9...I had to return them for a 9.5, but these where the Beeswax maybe suede is different ??"
3,Great Shoes way too big!,"These shoes age well, crease up nicely and would be comfortable if the sizing wasn't so off. The pair I bought are huge on me. I'd say get at least 1.5 sizes less than you would normally get."
4,The Best Desert Boots Out There!,"These boots are awesome, but you should definitely order a size down when you buy them. They look great with jeans and corduroys!"
5,Fit and Look great,This is my second pair of Desert Boots. I chose the Beeswax for the smooth leather look. I found them to be true to size. I wear a size 10 usually and that is what I ordered and they fit great. These look great dressed up or dressed down. Desert Boots are timeless and you will not be disappointed in your purchase.
2,wrong color,I received sand suede color instead oakwood so it is anoiyng to receive something that you do not expected. I will return it.
2,last of boots is not match!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i had received inferior goods.boots last is not match.so i'm really disappointed.be careful next buyer.Check the product before you send it.
1,Clarks shoes,"These shoes are no longer made in England...They are made in China, vietnam and Cambodia, you know they are being made with child labor....."
5,Stylish and comfortable,"I love these shoes! It is the first I ever bought desert boots, and I love them! They're now my favorite shoes. Not suitable for long distance walking, but very stylish and comfortable. I'd recommend them to my friends"
4,Way larger than the advertised size,I really like these- though I had to go through a few to learn that I needed to down-size at least a whole size to get a decent fit.
4,Clarks Desert Boot,"Comfortable and easliy broken in for my wide foot.I wear them daily, and like to keep them well oiled.The sole is a bit thin so I like jell heels. For a full jell sole you should buy a half size larger than your normal size."
4,Comfort,"They are very good and confortable for the price, I paid $70. It is very hard to go wrong with Clarks"
5,They look great !,My husband remembers his first pair of desert boots in the 1980's and has been wanting a pair. I bought him these for Christmas and he loves them ! He put them on with his pajamas and wore them all day.
3,Product was great but too large,I ordered these a half size smaller than normal (per online recommendations) and they were still too big! Definitely order a full size down. We returned them and got the right size.
3,"Really uncomfortable, but great looking-",Well first off I wear a size 11.5-12 regular shoe and I got a size 10.5 D(M) in these and they fit pretty perfect (remember that they stretch with a few wears). I got the oakwood color and they look great however I have been getting TERRIBLE blisters and was forced to buy Dr. Scholls heel cups which did the trick but the shoe still isn't the most comfortable. Overall get atleast a half a size down from your regular shoe size and if you are getting blisters get heel cups. The boots go with everything and are a classic style that will last forever...
4,Solid shoes,"These shoes have solid construction, and are a great look. They only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is the speed with which the soles of the shoes discolored(e.g. turned black) from walking around. I will be buying more of them in the future. Though I doubt they will wear out any time soon."
5,Must have for every man,"Saw these at the Clark's store where they are $120, but got a much better deal on Amazon for around $85. These boots are not only stylish but ridiculously comfortable. This Oakwood color is pretty light (but not too light) so they are good for a casual jeans and a tee shirt outfit. I also got 2 darker pairs for going out. I think it's worth for every guy to have at least one of these in their closet. Sizes run large!! I recommend trying them on at the store. I usually wear 10.5, and I got 9.5 in these and they're perfect."
4,"Good Looking, but please take care of this when ordering","This boots are just great, but are MEASURED IN UK SIZES, THESE WERE DESIGNED IN THE UK so be sure to get them 1 size down than your usual shoe size.I've bought them half size down, as some reviewers appointed, but now i regret i didn't ordered 1 size down because even though they are comfy, they are a little loose at the ankle, and when walking long run they start to hurt my feet because of the space left.I've ordered the Taupe Suede because they looked brownish in the photo, but they are more like Grey but also look awesome."
5,gooooooooooood,Good design. Good color. Nice autumn shoes matching well with any pants. Also the price was very reasonable. I am perfectly satisfied:)
4,Old Standard,This is an old standard. I used to wear these all the time when I was a young man. Nice getting reacquainted. Clark's quality seems to be one of the few constants in footwear.
4,Order a size down,"Boots are exactly as pictured, however they do run a little big. Make sure you order at least a size down. Probably should have ordered 1 and a half sizes lower."
3,great look but sized odd and could use an extra row of eyelets,"I thought these were really cool. A great retro-cool look (made me want to drink Mai-Tais and listen to cool jazz) but the sizing was not right for my foot, so I returned them. I tried 2 sizes (I burned up the savings by having to pay return shipping to Amazon - some competing sites don't make you pay to return shoes......); the first my regular size which was too big, and then a half size smaller which was too small. As popular as these shoes are, my guess is that the problem is with my feet, not the shoes. It probably could have been helped if the shoes had an extra row of eyelets so the strings would go up just that much higher. But, I don't blame Clarks for not altering a classic."
3,okay boot,The boot has gone down in terms of quality. I saw permanent creases on the second wear and it was easily scratched. The comfort was decent. It looks very fashionably however.
4,Great Boot,"Excellent boot, it is very comfy and looks great. Just be careful if you are going to be hiking on rocky terrain, the soles allow you to feel allot of it."
5,Best Boots On The Planet!,"I've been wearing Clarks for decades. They haven't changed a thing since British Officer's were wearing them while chasing Rommel across North Africa! Simply the finest ""desert boots"" on earth!"
5,Clarks Originals Desert Boots,I wore these as a kid and now pushing 50 I wanted a comfortable low cut boot. These boots are comfortable to wear right out of the box and only get better with age.
1,POOR QUALITY COMPARED TO EARLIER VERSION OF BOOT,I have bought two pair of the desert boot but many years ago! The quality was so good they lasted forever. The old boots had a dark sole and where made in Brazil. Very strong stitch and thick material. The new ones the sole is cheap lighter material and the boot does not have any stitch and the material is thinner!
3,the desert boot,"They look great. Have been getting compliments. Comfort, not so great. They are the correct size, and my feet still rub on the inside. I don't do a lot of walking in them. But if I had to walk for a long period... ouch!"
5,"Just Like ""Old Times""","I had my last pair of Clarks Desert Boots about 50 years ago in high school, they were great then and are just as great today. These shoes are very comfortable and look good with jeans, cords, or slacks. The sand suede color is classic along with the crepe soles. I'm very pleased with the quality of Clarks and look forward to enjoying my Clarks Originals."
4,Good With One Important Note,"I bought two pairs of these desert boots since I had a coupon code and love them in general. Normally I stick with Johnston and Murphy (my favorite for desert boots) or Rockport. I figured Clarks is in the same quality range as Rockport so I took a risk an ordered online.The shoes fit fine and seem fairly true to size as far as I can tell. They look okay, so no real gripes there. What did let me down was the cushioning. A quality interior with adequate cushioning is important for me and these shoes have little to no cushion. I know....I know....some people are probably thinking just buy inserts, but they never, ever fit properly and you always know you are wearing inserts. If it isn't a big deal to you, then these are otherwise good shoes. I'd give them a 3.5 if you could give half stars."
5,Desert Boots - What A Fantastic Find!!,"I have looked everywhere for desert boots without any luck. They did not seem to exist anymore. This was a shoe that I had worn forever. On a whim I checked Amazon and was pleasently surprised to find these shoes. They are exactly what I wanted. Great shoe, great service."
3,"Beautiful shoes, but...","The shoes look wonderful. However, what is with the most grossly miscalculated shoe sizes? I bought a size 9, and I normally wear a 9 thru 9.5. The shoe fits like a size 11! I hate how they can be so off and is an unfortunate oversight by the company. I went to the store, and lo and behold I fit in a size 7.5.Second, the shoe is not exactly comfortable even in the correct size, as I found similar boots by Sperry top-sider at the same store and 1912 feel MUCH better instantly.5 stars for appearanceminus 1 star for grossly exacerbate mis-sized shoesminus 1 star for comfort"
4,Slow Shipment-Good Product,"The boots are fine, simple, comfortable and good looking. I shop a lot from Amazon, this was probably one of the slowest shipments so far, it was a birthday gift and arrived after the birthday. I placed the order on February 21, somehow the sender waited three days to actually ship the boots from his warehouse. From PA to NY, it took more than a week for me to receive the boots. But finally the boots arrived, and when arrived - they arrived as described."
1,Not good.,"Uncomfortable shoe to wear all day, and they are not a good solid shoe, it's feel like they could fall apart anytime now."
5,"Fantastic, über-comfortable shoes!",These are some of the most comfortable and good-looking shoes I have ever owned. Just be sure to water proof them as soon as possible! Great shoes!
3,Not what it used to be.,"when I decided to purchase these boots I had my doughts to beging with they run big Im a 10.5m I ended up trying a 9m even though it fit,i notice that since the laces are minimal and placed in the middle of the foot they have a tendancy to lift your feet as you walk,plus the boot is higher than the original(USA made), now they are made in Vietnam,so much for a classic I did not buy them they just dont feel the same as the original ones...if in dought find a Clarks retailer and try them on before pulling the trigger...although they look really good and the quality of the leather is also good.....I hope that this has helped"
4,Look great. Size can be tricky.,First of all love these boots. Own several suede pairs in different colors. The sizing definitely runs large for me. In Nike I wear size 12. In alot of other shoes I wear 11. In these desert boots I size down to 10.5.If there is one complaint it would be with the laces. There's only two eyelets. There's room for a third hole higher on the ankle. This would snug the fit up in the ankle and heel area IMO.
4,"Good quality, great style","Desert boots are an unusual fit, but once broken in offer great comfort. The crepe sole is forgiving and leather molds nicely to your feet.Very happy with the quality at that price and they shoes feel like they will last a good while."
2,Not real leather,"I have been a great fan of the desert boot for a long time, I started looking for a new pair before they came back into vogue recently but to my dismay I have not found a brand between $50 and $250 that were made from real leather. It is a composite sort of leather usually on a material backing and is very hard to pick with the unpracticed eye and you have to practically damage the shoe to test this fact unless you have an original to compare them with. The best desert boots that I have come across were a Polish brand called rollers but I doubt that they exist any more."
2,defective,"Great shoe, but worn for a week and I tried to use specific made cleaner for the shoe, made shoe lose its color completely. I liked the shoe, but with one use of the cleaner product made specifically for this color and type, made the shoe terrible. I emailed the seller and never got a response, go figure. Seems to me its a good shoe at first, but if you get dirty at all do not clean it with cleaner because it seems that the color on the shoe was painted on or stained bad. Good shoe if you don't get dirty though. The color still seems like it was painted on the shoe."
2,not what I expected,"I previously owned Clark suede desert boots that I loved with great arch support. These shoes are totally different. They have gummy soles and a vinyl-like finish outside (not suede). Very disappointed. Also, no arch support. Hiss boo!"
1,Used Shoes?,"I was really excited when I got these shoes but when I opened the box they looked like they had been broken-in already,had noticeable scratching and fit looser than the same sized pair I had previously tried on at a store. I'm not sure if I failed to read on the site somewhere that these shoes were previously owned or something but if it did, then I'll fix my review.I only have a couple days left to decide to return/exchange them but I don't even know what size I should order now. Should I assume the next pair will be broken-in and size down or order another of the same size...My first time ordering shoes from amazon, hooray for first time experiences :\"
5,Good quality; Great fit,"Perfect fit and sensational quality. It was a wonderful Christmas present and because it was ordered off the Amazon Wish List, it was just what our son wanted!"
4,good,"When I bought it,I heard I should buy one size up.so I bought one size up.But it is a little big."
3,Not comfortable,"They look great, they *seem* to be made of nice materials. But my son says they are not comfortable. He is keeping them because he loves the way they look and is hoping they get more comfortable in time. Not sure if the problem is his particular foot shape, or the design of the shoe..."
4,Nice,"Let me just say that people who said order a size down were not kidding. I usually wear 9.5 (I know, not big feet), but for these shoes I ordered 8.5 and it fits me great.The shoes look great, feel good, and can be worn with pretty much ant pants. I'm thinking of ordering different colors of these same shoes.They were not meant to be worn on cold weather. They are perfect for little hotter weather as they keep your feet nice, cool, and comfortable.The heal was not as comfortable as I thought. I have smaller feet so I wouldn't blame the shoes for this. It kind of scrapes my heel after few hours of walking around. It rubs my heel on the inside and it is kind of painful to walk. I think I might find some heel cups to solve this problem.They look stylish though. I got few compliments so far from both males and females.UPDATE: I still give it four star rating. I got some heel cups to make these shoes more comfortable. They seemed to be working."
4,Size,"Others say to order 1 size smaller, so I ordered 9.5, too small, then 1 size up, 10.5, too big.Order your size! 10.... hassle"
1,"the product never I arrive, seems that I give myself in another direction","the product never I arrive, seems that I give myself in another direction Mr. JorgeCurvelo I do not know it and supposedly I sign"
5,Excellent,"These boots are great. They are true to size, are made with high quality, and look fabulous. Highly, highly recommended."
3,"They look great, but...","They look great, but they are the most uncomfortable Clarks I've ever owned. The foot portion is not bad but the upper leather is rubbing sores. They do run 1/2 size big too."
3,Design and material is good; comfortability is question mark,Design:4/5Comfort 3/5Quality 4/5Sizing: Runs a little big (I wear Nike size 10 or sometimes 10.5; Clarks Desert Boot size 9.5)
2,Painful ridge in the insert and they look shabby a week after ordering.,"After wearing these for a week, the shoe insert formed a painful ridge on the heel. I had to buy inserts as if they were several months old. Also the sole of the shoe is gum, which after walking on them for over a week looks black and dirty. And the upper shoe retains scuffs and scratches.After wearing these shoes for a week, they look and feel like they're several months old. If this is the intended look (this is the era of pre-torn, pre-worn jeans) then I apologize. But the poor quality of the insert is inexcusable.That being said, after buying new inserts the shoes are comfortable and look good, if well used."
4,Very good looking,"The boots look awesome. The very moment I put them on, I got compliments. However, they get dirty really quick, especially the sole."
4,Clarks shoes are very comfortable,I have worn Clark shoes since the 70's and when I saw the shoes on your web site I had to order a pair becuase you don't se them in stores today. The only problem that I have is that instead of two eyelets for the strings there should have benn three eyelets in the shoe. Maybe that something that can be address for future orders.
4,Cool but the color is a dirt magnet,"I love these shoes, I had a pair about twenty years ago (made in England then!) which were dark blue. I got comments on them all the time so I was looking for something understated once again and found these. They're much more comfortable than I remember the other's being at first but I was distressed to see how much dirt they pick up."
4,Men's Desert Boots,"These boots are comfortable and ""neat looking"". Exactly as I remember the desert boots I had in High School about 48 years ago."
2,look good brand new but.....,"I bought these as a cheaper replacement for the Jcrew Mcallister boot that retails for $135. The Desert Boot looks very similar but has a more rounded toe that makes them not as dressy and more like Doc Martins, which was disappointing because I wanted a business casual shoe to wear with chinos. The leather is also very cheap (very stiff) it creases very easy and they stays creased even with shoe trees. These creases in the toe region make them look cheap and ""frumpy"" and is a characteristic of a low quality shoe... Too bad I've already worn them, I would of returned them and just forked over the extra cash for the Jcrew Mcallisters."
4,Comfortable and versatile,Comfortable boots. Look good. No worries. Reccomend if you are looking for casual footwear. Anthony Bourdain calls these the most comfortable boots you can buy. I cannot argue based on my experience.
5,Clark Review,We are very pleased with this product. The product is as advertised. The quality is excellent as they have always been. We will buy again from this company and would recommend them any time. Thank you for your fine products.
3,Surprise - not versatile,"I've had mine for a few years, but they have low mileage because they only go with blue jeans. If I pair them with khakis, it looks like I'm wear footsie pajamas. They don't go with navy chinos because the pants look dressy and the boots look way too casual. Something looks is off when I pair them with black jeans. They look great with blue jeans, so if you wear BLUE jeans regularly, get 'em.Oh, and they are cold in wintery temperatures (45F and below) because they are Desert Boots. They are cool & comfy in the summer, but colder than slippers in winter."
1,Timeless my foot!,"I used to pretty much live in these boots, but for some reason--possibly related to the move to Far East production--Clarks now only make them in a much narrower fitting than before. They've also ramped the price up since they came back into fashion--they used to be a great, cheap option for students and the like, but they're now about three or four times the price of the cheapest alternatives. A sad end to a great British tradition of comfy, economical, yet stylish and well-made shoes."
4,Taupe Suede Rules.,"I absolutely love the color of the taupe suede desert boot. It goes with almost everything in my wardrobe. The build quality is good; I especially dig the flexibility of the sole which makes it very comfy to walk around in these. I don't have any problems with them chaffing the backs of my feet because I ordered the right size, which was 1/2 size down from my usual size. I always wear a 12 but went to a local store to try these on before I placed my order and found that they run a little big, so I went with the 11 1/2 which fits great. I've only worn them a couple times so they aren't worn in yet, but they are still pretty comfortable. I have high arches and this is a flat-soled shoe so they aren't the greatest at keeping my feet ache-free if i'm standing or walking around for most of the day. But other than that I am very happy with these shoes because they are super stylin' and all around awesome."
4,CDB's the best Clarks have to Offer,i m not a fan of the what Clarks make exept for CBD's i own a couple of pairs now . i can say they are comfortable and stylish which i can not say for the rest of Clarks .. looking fwd to get one more
2,Not for me,"I really liked the look of these boots, but found them to be very uncomfortable. The two eyelet design only tightens the boot above the foot arch. Both my forefoot and heel felt unsecured in this boot. The crepe sole looked shabby after only 2-3 wears. The footbed was OK, but not good enough to make up for the other fit issues. I wanted to like the boot, but it wasn't meant to be, or meant for me.Amazon offered terrific support for my return. Very pleased with customer service on this purchase."
4,cool color but hard to clean it.,"Cool color but hard to clean it, and it is much softer than other boots.width is good for fat foot."
3,Look good but arent very durable,"I ordered these boots thinking that they would be pretty tough, my first impression of them is that the sole wont last very long. Its kind of waxy and gets dark by picking up tar from the road also cat hair and other stuff and I've worn them out only once. They are comfortable though. About size I'd recommend measuring your sole in inches or cm and buying the corresponding size. I wear size 9 US and got an 8.5 for these, they're a perfect fit."
3,They look great but don't last.,"I have a seirous love hate relationship with Clarks as a company. All of their shoes look awesome and the shoe itself ages very nicely but, the silicon sole quickly loses the bounce it has upon first wearing them. When I get a pair of shoes I expect them to give me at lesat 4 or 5 months of everyday wear. These did not even last a month and a half without the sole being worn down and developing a pretty serious hole. I had such a dilema on my hands whenever I wanted to wear them, wear socks and rip a hole in them or wear no socks and be incredibly uncomfortable, not to mention stink up my shoes.I eventually just had to put them down just becuase I didn't want to hassle with them anymore.If you are the type of person shopping for these shoes who doesn't want to wear them daily for a long period of time then get them right now. But, if you're like me then just don't bother and look around a little harder for something equally stylish and durable."
1,"Great quality, but they simply don't fit","These boots are not made for anyone with any sort of instep/arch. I cannot even get my foot into the boot, much less lace it up. Too bad, really because I remember them fondly from my youth and they are still typically great Clark's quality."
2,Huge Size,"I bought two pairs the same day by Amazon, first one pair is a 9 US (fitted perfect), second one (the reason of my review) is 9.5 US however the size is so huge, I guess it is 10.5 or 11 but never 9.5 US. I cannot return it because I'm located outside of US so I'm going to try to sell and get back my money."
3,desert boot,got a pair last November 2011. By May i had noticed that the crepe outsole had a slight crack. Other than the boot is really comfortable and nice.
5,Best pair of shoes I own!,"After having these for about a month now I can honestly say that these things are amazing. They go with almost anything and look great. Additionally, they are incredibly comfortable, I cant say that enough. I am constantly surprised by the number of compliments I get every time I wear them.... which is at least three times a week."
4,great shoe just the way i remembered.,im really glad to have found these shoes. the only type of shoe i wore in high school. feels good and is true to size. great shoe to just kick around in. feels great. glad they come in different colors too. i like em. thanks for the memories. joe
2,"Nice looking boots, but...","Really like the look of these boots, but the comfort is not what I have come to expect from Clarks products. The laces do not go high enough up the ankle to secure your foot in place and, for me, if I tie them tightly where the eyelets are, the boots hurt the top of my feet. If I don't tie the laces very tightly, my foot slips around in the heel, gets irritated and blisters. Can not recommend this shoe."
3,Looks great but,looks great but forgot how stiff they are...yes I know they need to be broken in but no arch support. Used to wearing runners that are super soft and great on the feet right out of the box. Guess when I was younger it did not matter what you put on your feet but now...not so much. Still a good looking shoe though. Figured after 30plus years they would have used technology to advance the comfort of the shoe.
5,"Great boots, run huge","Great style, relatively comfortable, and inexpensive. They run really big though. I'm a 13 and have never sized up or down on any shoe I've owned. The 13s were unwearable. I exchanged for 12s and even think I might be able to wear an 11.5."
3,Not good for long walks,"I bought these after asking around and reading reviews. My main concern was that they were going to be comfortable. Everyone I talked to and read said that they were so I bought a pair. I wore them a few times to work to break them in before a weekend trip to NYC. My office has carpet and I dont walk around too much. So I thought they were going to be good for my trip. Turns out, I was wrong. After the first day of walking, I was in serious pain. The second and third days were awful. While these may seem comfortable when you walk a small amount, they are not to be used for long distances or a long period of time on your feet."
3,Clarks desert boot,"I found these boots to be a little tight in the top and sides but with plenty of room in the toe. One more row of laces would also be beneficial. The gum sole is comfortable and while the leather is a little stiff to break in, the shoes are conforming well to my feet. I think they`ll get better with time."
3,Not bad,I would have given these boots four stars except I paid almost $100 dollars and should have only paid about half that. I have seen them around at Marshals and similar stores for that much. Old Navy also sells identical boots for $49.99. There is little if any padding on the bottom of these shoes so they are not comfortable if worn for a long period of time. The three stars is for good looks alone. Don't pay more than $50 for them.
2,Uncomfortable,"Very Uncomfortable, it is like the are big, because laces has only 2 wholes this shoes feel very loose, not recommended"
1,Embarassing!,"I own more pair of Clarks than I can count, and are wearing some now. These are embarrassing to the brand. Fit poorly. Poorly constructed. Look dirty and cheap right out of the box. Generally uncomfortable. Return!"
3,Not enough support,"Always satisfied with Clark products. Good materials, good workmanship. However, these days, I require serious arch support. These classics do not have enough support for me."
1,Didn't do a thing,"We set off two of these in our small trailer, and the fleas were as bad as ever that same evening."
4,Good stuff,"Don't know if the other reviewers had a bad batch or something, but I have found it to be really good... Love the chocolate and the peanut butter ones (try mixing them). I have ""subscribed"" to both to get them shipped regularly..."
4,"I love it, but","This granola is great. Perhaps what I appreciate most about it is that it's not overly sweetened--just enough to get the granola to stick together well. The peanut butter flavor is subtle but adds a wonderful richness to the granola, making it an excellent snack food any time. The only problem is that I bit into one of the clusters and it had so much sea salt it literally tasted as if I had bitten into crystallized brine. Luckily, it only happened once. It's not anything I would say is regular, for sure, but if you find a big honkin' chunk of granola in your bag...give it a little nibble before you pop it in your mouth."
2,"Not the Worst, But....","I didn't enjoy this granola. The peanut butter flavor had a wierd burnt-like taste to it. It's hard to discribe, but I definately wouldn't use the term ""good."" I may have just gotten an old batch."
1,"So, so reference with heavy commercial flavor......","There is no doubt of Mr. Sanden's artistic talent and there is some good information in this book but in the final analysis it's a promo for his line of art paint and supplies. I don't like to paint by a specific formula approach and certainly don't want to get where I can't mix my own colors, and have to follow a sophisticated master formula mix that I have to order from Mr. Sanden or from anyone else. I would look around before I ordered this book for more traditional books on how to mix color and attain the shade you desire. I feel I purchased a glorified commercial in this book. My advice:keep looking for books that are less commercial and more focused on helping you learn how to mix colors already on the market. After all, half the fun is discovering that you can attain just about any color in the rainbow with a handful of primary and secondary colors you can find in any art store."
3,Portraits from Life for Dummies,"Bought this book and found it aggravating. I'm an experienced artist and just wanted some clues to improve my portraits. But this artist, John Sanders, must think people are real dummies with a fortune to spend on paints. He has some secret mixtures for base paints when the artist needs to know how to mix these themselves. I don't have a problem with people that want to buy and use these mixes, but how about also telling artists how mix themselves too. Of course, then he won't make money off you by selling the mixtures to you. Yeh right. Only if you want to be incompetent forever. If you want to be a real artist, figure it out for yourself by trial and error and suggestions from art sites on what to use for portraits and skin tones."
1,Poor,"I did not like this book, it was outdated. The steps (demonstration) were not clear, hard to read. I do not recommend this book."
4,Portrait Paintings in 29 Steps,"This is a very good book, with basic principles presented in a rationale manner. Especially the view of the head as a sculpture showing the values by illuminating the carved statue of the head. The full effects of this book cannot be appreciated without using the promix system, and the DVD that corresponds to the book. You need to have both of these to obtain maximum information. Overall I would rate this book and the DVD that corresponds to it as very good and informative. I am still practicing the techniques, so a complete analysis cannot be made for about one year. At this point it is worth the price of admission. This is a good book for an intermidiate level artist. This is not for a beginner. You need to know how to draw portraits first, especially with a long handled brush."
2,misleading title,"As a portrait artist, I was hoping to glean some new tips/tricks from this book. What Sanden illustrates in the ""29 steps"" is nothing more than a quick (completed in one hour) color study of his subjects. He admits in the text toward the end that the portraits featured in the book actually took many days to paint. Really, what a surprise! While it was interesting to see how he prepares his canvas and blocks in his subject, Sanden does not spend any time on the techniques he uses to give his portraits their ""finish,"" which is what most portrait artists are seeking to improve upon. What he does focus on are his own brand of paints that he pushes throughout the pages.Don't be fooled by the portrait on the cover. If you want to end up with a finished painting that looks like that, you will NOT learn how to do it in this book. If you are a beginning painter, and need to learn basic underpainting, or how to block in a subject, then this book might hold some interest."
1,good weight set but package didn't include barbell as advertised,"the weights are fine but the package wasn't shipped with the barbell as advertised...amazon offered to replace the whole set but i would have to pack up the incomplete set and send it back. it's too much a pain for me to carry a 55lb weight set down 3 flights of stairs and get it to a UPS center without a car, so i declined."
4,hoops#1,"Fantastic price to tone up without having to stop by the local gym. I will not see the lovely ladies toning up, but I can look at my lovely wife when I lift a bit. lol Great weight set and easy to assemble !"
1,Not as promised,"Like at least one other reviewer, what I actually received was a 45 lb. set: the two five pound plates were missing. My only option was to return the entire set. I elected to just buy the extra plates myself at Dick's (about $5 apiece). As others have noted, it is a spectacular price, especially with free shipping. Just be prepared to have to supplement the set at additional cost if you get one of the duds!"
5,Great,I love this product. There is not much to say other than it was exactly what I needed at a great price. The buyer sent it to me timely and it was in perfect condition.
3,The Iron Butterfly is still going!,"Rock 'n' Roll Greats - Iron ButterflyI'm anazed at the personnel changes! Doug Ingle (keyboards) is gone & I didn't even recognize Lee Dorman (bass). However, it's great to hear & see them again.Rock 'n' Roll Greats - Iron Butterfly"
1,Iron (rusty) Butterfly,"I was a bit disappointed with the performance. I admit I still have the original In-a-Gadda-da-Vida performance rattling around in my head, so any other version would of course fall short. Great to see the guys still doing their thing though."
3,It Works,"It works fine. And, as of this writing, it's a great deal for the price. I've tried it with 2 different hard drives and a cd-rw. Fairly easy intallation. The ide ribbon could be a bit longer. The downside is the case itself. It's difficult to open and close -- not designed very well. The side lights are pointless and I've already cut the wire to one side while trying to reassemble the case."
4,"Fresh, breezy, smooth jazz","A virtually undiscovered musician who recorded for a tiny, obscure record label, Joel Gaines is a fine practitioner of smooth, urban contemporary jazz and quiet storm soul. Album mostly consists of upbeat, nicely textured instrumentals showcasing Joel Gaines's proficiency on the piano, but Gaines himself takes a couple of turns on the mike, and he's a soulful if not superb singer, especially on the title track."
4,Remastered at last,"For every 100 customers who liked Joan's early albums, only one or two cared for BAPTISM. It is not to everybody's taste, so kudos to Vanguard for remastering it. It is a dark, dark collection, a meditation on tears, death, fear and loss, and overshadowed by a deep antipathy to war (this was 1968). Its best parts (COLOURS, WHO MURDERED THE MINUTES, CHILDHOOD III, THE MAGIC WOOD and EPITAPH FOR A POET are my favorites) are very moving. The rewards are worth the effort it takes to get into this recording."
4,I like it...,I know this album kind of divides fans and is considered her worse but the songs that are sung are gorgeous and I love the message behind this album! Peace baby!
2,JOAN...WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?,"This is a pretentious work by one of the greatest folk singers of all time. It features Joan Baez reading the poetic works of others with a smattering of music thrown in. This CD is the epitome of conceit. People buy Joan Baez CDs because of her glorious singing voice, not for her poetry reading.As a conceptual work, the premise of the CD is intriguing, a melding of poetry and music, with the poetry read against a backdrop of music. It is intended to be evocative of the times in which we live, with the poetry extending the range of the music. In its execution, however, the premise is seriously flawed by Joan Baez's reading voice, as she drones on and on, no thespian she.While it is obvious that a great deal of thought went into the selection of both the poetry and the music, it is an ambitious venture which does not work. Stick to singing, Joan. That is your gift."

3,Lassiter Rides Again,"In this, the first, of what would be a series of twelve books featuring Jim Lassiter, the prototypical gunman his father Zane Grey created and to which all other great gunmen are compared, Loren Zane Grey has tried to take us back to the years before ""Riders of the Purple Sage"" to give us a glimpse of the man and how he lived and what he did. Did he succeed? I'll leave that up to you. For me he didn't. But I know it is awfully difficult and dangerous to compare father and son. And despite Loren's own claim in People Magazine that he defied anyone to tell the difference between what he and his father wrote during the editorial process of readying some of the last manuscripts for publication--Black Mesa, The Reef Girl, and others--his style and writing of these books in no way compares to Zane Grey's, in descriptive quality, character development, or tone. That is not to say these books are not worth reading; they just don't match up with his father's work or legacy."
5,GOLD!,"One of Vishal Bhardwaj's best offerings to date with scintillating performances by Rekha Bhardwaj, Rahat Ali Khan, Sukhwinder Singh, Shreya Ghoshal, Vishal Bhardwaj, Sunidhi Chauhan, and Suresh Wadkar."
3,cute but too little,I was a little disappointed now teeny this bank is - you can't store very much change here. This was my son's favorite Pokemon character which is why I bought it but its really pretty useless as far as saving a lot of your kids change.
4,very good cd,"i think alot of ""old school"" fusion fans will dig this album, despite other reviews. but i think that the people that will really get into this album are fans of dream theater and the like. hopefully it will open the door from progressive rock to fusion for them. i'm likin this album."
4,Hardcore fusion at its best,"I'm a big fan of groups like Sypro Gyra and the Rippingtons, so I thought I'd give Vertu a whirl. It's definately a step in the ""heavy"" direction - which I find refreshing. At times, Vertu sounds positively out of control, a runaway jazz-rock locomotive. But herein lies the beauty. When Vertu hits the breaks for a soft interlude, they become absolutely hypnotic. I love the intesity of this CD. One small complaint: at times, the rest of the band buries pianist Rachel Z, who adds such a classy, delicate touch that you yearn to hear more of her. Next time, give her some room!"
1,Wasted effort,"Vertu wins by far the title of ""Greatest musical deception of 1999"". Bad themes, weak, mechanical, teenage-flavored soloing, bad mixing, lazy arrangements, lack of style and cohesiveness. It is not what we expected from guys like Stanley and Lenny after so many years of commercially-oriented recordings. In fact, it is still commercially oriented, but this time with a new marketing strategy: calling it ""fusion""."
4,Vertu... One Guy`s Opinion,"I received Vertu for Christmas and just listened to it for the first time. I`ve listened to Fusion since the mid-70`s and was pleasantly surprised by this CD. There are actual compositions, not just chord changes for romping over. Parts of it seem more progrock than jazz/rock fusion. Like it or not, it seems as though mixing genres is where music is headed. I liked their sound, especially the violin.They covered lots of musical territory, but that`s the way I like it.If you are a purest about style,you probably will not care for Vertu.But I think Clark, White, et al have done excellent work here, and I`m already looking forward to their next effort."
4,"Too Hard, but good.","The tests in this review book are much harder than the actual test. And, the explanations are terrible. The best use of this book is as a way of finding what you don't know. You can then find much better explanations online. Even Wikipedia's math entries are less dense than the ones in this book. I recommend theThe Official Study Guide for All SAT Subject Tests (Real Sats)orThe Official SAT Subject Tests in Mathematics Levels 1 & 2 Study Guide (Official Sat Subject Tests in Mathematics Levels 1 & 2 Study Guide)because the tests in these are much more realistic."
3,good but has errors,This book is good but it has errors that need to be corrected. It is more detailed than Princeton Review but harder to follow.
2,VERY BAD,"I bought this book 2 months before I took the exam and took a couple tests from it and by the scale they gave me, it looked to me like i was going to be scoring in the 500s or below. The questions in this book are SO MUCH HARDER than the actual test. They try to over-prep you by giving you super hard questions so that the ones on the actual test seem easier and you feel more confident. This was definately NOT the type of preparation I needed, and thanks to them, I scored a 650. A score I am ashamed of and now i have to take it again. I heard from a friend that the Sparknotes book is MUCH BETTER. I'm warning you, stay away from Barron."
1,full of mistakes and not worthwhile,"As a student who has already taken AP Calculus, I bought this book to review stuff that I had forgotten or may have never been taught. This book has many examples, but often never actually tells you the information, which I find to be annoying. The practice tests are far more difficult than the actual test, and the answer keys contain many mistakes. When looking over the explantions/answers to questions I got wrong, I discovered that I had the right answer, but the letter answer that was listed was wrong.I can't say this book is a complete waste of time, because it did actually help me a little, but probably not enough to be worthwhile.I got an 800 on the test, but I don't think this book can be attributed with my sucess."
3,Best as a complimentary aid,"Well I just finished Cal II and got a 700 on the regular SAT math, and this book is still very difficult. The explanations are often too short, but I do like that there are examples and pretty detailed answers. However, unless you are one of the luckier students who had a very comprehensive high school mathematics education, you won't know some of the topics in this book. Even after reading the explanations you'll often be left wondering and the book gives too much information, listing many formulas that I would bet will not be necessary for the test. I'd buy this book if you want to get an 800, but I'd also buy a book like Kaplan's to better explain some of the material."
3,Harder is better,"It is true, this book is much harder than the actual test, but that is good and bad. This book is not good if you have only a short time before the test, because it has a lot of information that may not be on the actual test. However, if you have a month or more, than this book is great for understanding the concepts that you will need to know. Preparing for harder questions will make it easier to anwswer the questions on the test. Because this book is challenging, I would suggest using the Real SAT II book along with it so you can compare the two. The only mistake I made with this book, was using it with only a few days before the test."
5,The Bible of SAT Math 2C,"Howard Dodge's ""How to Prepare for the SAT II Math Level IIC"" is the one book that prepares a student in the best possible way. As an educator I have used this book a lot and I reccomend this book to every student. It is more complete than many of the books on the same subject."
2,Barron's has made better,"Usually, people have always said that Barron's is the best in standardized test preparations and I used to agree. However, for the SAT II MATH IIC, the book was absolutely absurd - after doing their diagnostics, reading their review lessons and, taking the practice tests, I was scared to death: this is going to be so tough and one of my most difficult tests by far, even with a 4.0 GPA, 1590 SAT, and AP calculus under my belt.When test day came, I was shocked - it was hilariously easy, so much so that I almost felt cheated for being made to worry.When it comes to test prepartions, being accurate is the most important - the same level materials and practice tests are essential to success. Barron's book is overly-difficult and not worth the money or worry."
2,Hard!,"I am a 7th grader looking for some out of school math to do (you probobly think I am crazy) so I bought this book along with the Kaplan one. In terms of knowing the material, I was clueless. The kaplan book (2005-2006) tought me the basic material and then I came to this book for more (I was already familiar with the fact that barron's books are harder than the real thing) but ended up not getting it. Barron's book goes over (It talks about them, but never explains them well) words that have never appeared on the Sat II IIC test! I guess it is good practice but I recomend you have a solid math backround before buying this book."
1,Harder is NOT better!,"Last three editions of this book are all the same, buy an older version, or better, don't buy at all. Unreasonably hard, a lot of errors, not corrected in newer versions and incomplete. No mister, harder is NOT better."
1,Where's the smell?,"I received this product and it didn't smell at all. I held nose to it, tried rubbing it together and even unwrapped it thinking I did something wrong. Very dissapointed."
2,Not enough by itself,"I found that this book gives a decent overview, but lacks specifics that need to be covered to pass the current version of the 1.8 CCA test. Supplement this book with cheet-sheets or something like that that has actual test questions."
5,This is the one!,"...That I used to get my W2K MetaFrame server up and running my ASP. Clearly written, clearly the one to get....HENCH"
2,Not the greatest;lot of errors;but you gotta study something,"A lot of discrepancies in this book. A lot of points not discussed in this book. What connection type is possible to a MetaFrame Server? You will not find it in this book, but the question is on the test. What is the minimum disk space required for a MetaFrame 1.8 installation? 30mb or 32mb? The book can't decide. Also, MCP stands for Microsoft Certified Professional. If either one of the authors were actually Microsoft certified, they would have immediately known that and not incorrectly identified MCP as a Microsoft Certified Provider. The publisher of this book needs to protect their (very) good name and revise this incomplete edition."
4,beautiful,It is a product - it is as decribed - no additional description neededmin words should not apply to this product
4,Great lens,the glasses really do have a great lens the ACE glass does offer a very clear and accurate color visibility while still protecting your eyes from UV. I really couldn't imagine doing lamp work without them anymore. the frame and lenses are well made and have held up well so far there also good looking and do the job.
3,"Average ""BH&G"" style book","I didn't find this book to be especially strong in any area. If you are familiar with the ""Better Homes & Gardens"" style of ""how to"" book then you know what to expect from this book. The editors provided an overview of all aspects of fence building without really setting a good foundation for building any fence. After reading this book you will be better equiped to discuss a new fence with a fencing contractor and if that's what your after, this could be your book."
2,not for wood fences,"I wanted to learn how to build a wood fence. I read through this entire book and still didn't know anything more than when I started. This book skims the surface on stone walls, etc. but gives little detail on anything"
5,BEST OF THE BOOKS ON THIS SUBJECT,"We were looking for a good basic idea book on fence styles and types. ""The Fence Bible"" fit the bill. It is loaded with illustrations and ""how-to"" information on every kind of fence and/or barrier you can imagine. A reference any homeowner with a garden or yard would be happy to have. Highly recommended if you're starting from square one on any fence project."
3,Lovely book. Not sure who it is for.,"This book has many thoughtful notes and beautiful photos. I don't know who should buy it - landscape designers perhaps? It covers so many types of fences in such little detail, it is not likely to be especially useful to anyone who actually wants to build any particular kind of fence.The most common fence for the majority of North Americans is the ""vertical board fence."" It gets two pages - yes, two pages - in this 260 page book. On pages 108 and 109 it shows five photographs of tall, solid wooden fences. It discusses no construction details and says little about how one would reproduce the designs in the photos shown. It helpfully mentions ""Vertical board fences tend to be... more visible than other fence styles, and thus worthy of careful and thoughtful design."" However you are on your own for that design, this book has less to offer than most magazine articles.Wish I had done more research before purchasing. This one is headed for the used book shop."
2,Not very helpful,"For such a large book on fences, it has very little useful information about them. There is practically zero technical information about how to build fences or examples of fence types or gates. I can use google image search and get more information about different types of fencing and even how to build those types than this book provided. I needed to know details of how best to construct fencing and pitfalls to avoid when building fencing, but this book didn't provide any of that."
4,Good Background Book,A lot of work went into this volume and it provides good details on various fence designs along with many useful illustrations and photographs.
1,Pretty Pictures,"This book has lots and lots of pretty pictures of fences that are not explained or detailed. There is decent information about rock walls, but otherwise this book really lacks in the substance needed to build fences."
5,The Versatile Yo-Yo Ma,"I've found this collection to be extremely delightful! It gives you a sense of the versatility of Yo-Yo Ma like no other, with one disc being dedicated more to his classical side, while the other explores jazz and world music venues. Not your typical ""greatest hits"" collection."
3,too eclectic for me,"Yo-yo-ma has an eclectic range of taste all right, but some of that music seems very repetitive and going nowhere."
5,Masterful,This artist is to my mind the greatest at this instrument. He brings a mastery and a wonderful freshness to his interpretations that is a joy.
5,Essential Yo-yo Ma,"""Essential"" is a good title for it because it includes pieces that should be essential to a cellist's repertoire. Yo-Yo Ma does it beautifully."
5,Great product,This gooseneck light provides just the right brightness for my mackie 1604 compact mixer. I am so glad I purchased this light. I highly suggest this product. I use this for a mobile mixer cart for musical theater.
2,"OK, But not the best SVU book","This book was OK, but could stand some adjustment. First of all,Tom is a jerk and should just leave Liz alone already! And,Mike Should quit practicly stalking Jess! All though the begining was good, The end just wasn't."
3,"good sound, excellent price","Detail and power handling good, but they're more than a little ""bright."" A little less tweeter, a little more mid/low would help. If these are being augmented by other, larger speakers you'd be hard-pressed to find a better sounding 3.5"" speaker at this price."
2,As the saying goes you get for what you pay for.,"Well for $11.00 dollars your really not going to get much. It says POWER HANDLING, PEAK 140 Watts. Your lucky to get 40 Watts out of it but then again for that price they are a good replacement if you own a 94 cavalier with no speakers. LOL"
2,Eh,"Got what I paid for ($5) - you can't buy a decent pair of speakers for this low of a price.They sounded horribly poor when I hooked them up - the speakers literally hurt my ears with the highs, and not in a ""oh-so-loud"" way, but in a painfully screeching way. Perhaps mine were defective.And to make matters worse they, despite being a 3.5 inch speaker, did not fit into the 3.5 inch speaker holes in my wife's 1996 Dodge Neon. Not worth returning as I'd end up paying what I paid for them just to return them so they'll just take up space until I find a purpose for them."
4,great DVD,"While I was disappointed that they didn't perform the entire Water Music, the movements that are performed are played exceptionally well: excellent musicians and period-style performance, exceptional DTS surround sound, and very visually engaging (they took great pains to re-create every aspect of the original performance of the Water Music, including full period dress and a fully-outfitted 18th century style boat that they play on while floating down the river). Highly recommended. (I would have given this 5 stars if they played the entire Water Music, but I think they were limited on time due to this originally being a BBC broadcast program)."
4,EXTREMELY Good - Could Have Been Excellent,"Both previous reviewers make valid points. Given all the time effort (and presumably BBC funding) they put into the research and preparation, -to say nothing of the sheer historical ballyhoo they make about this being the first time in nearly 300 years Handel's Water Music has been performed as intended- it seems almost shocking that the complete performance was not presented on the DVD.The previous reviewer pointed out that his started life as a BBC TV special, so it may have been originally pared down for a TV time slot, but given all the fuss made about the re-recreation it seems inconceivable that they didn't actually perform the full Water Music, so why not present it on the DVD? Even if only as one of the audio slideshow extras.On the whole, however, what they do offer is Extremely well-done, entertaining and informative. This is an excellent production for use in a classroom or private study and highly recommended."
1,Beginners book,"I purchased this book after reading about him on a website. I feel that his advice was interesting for the novice investor. However for experienced traders, i think that the advice here is redundant."
4,Short & Sweet,"This little book gets right to the point, and is easy to digest. A wonderful piece of work. Looking forward to digging into more of Robert Campbell's work!"
2,Dead Zeppelin: Painfully funny,"I bought this c.d. for my boyfriend who hates Led Zeppelin(which I love)but loves death metal in an attempt to fuse our musical styles together into something we could both appreciate. Although this album is not really a great quality one, it is funny as hell! Some of the songs just cracked me up! Especially the rendition of ""Immigrant Song."" Unlike most tribute albums, this one is kind of cool in the way that the artists covering the songs totally re-worked them, instead of just repetitively playing back the songs in their original form. Whether you are a hard-core death metal enthusiast, or a Zeppelin fan with a sense of humor, you are sure to enjoy this album.My boyfriend did!"
3,Interesting,"This is a merger of some of my two favorite things, Led Zeppelin and Death/Speed Metal. It is an interesting yet wierd take on Zeppelin. Mind you, the artists transform the originals into their own renditions. The best track on the album is Immigrant Song. The rendition keeps as close to the original as possible but the artist adds some haunting goth vocals. This album is definately not for those die-hard fans of Led Zeppelin, but is a great album for those Metal fans."
4,a must for your collection if...,"...you own every Led Zeppelin album and both Spinal Tap albums. I appreciate the tribute and the humor!I confirmed a decision to travel to northeast Europe after listening to this album. 7 out to the 12 bands are international: 2 Czech, one Canadian, one Estonian, one German, one Norwegian and one from Singapore. Turn up the air-conditioning, wear black and drink icy vodka while listening to his album variously described by the bands themselves as doom-metal, death-metal, goth-metal, dirge and thrash. Best tracks are ""Kashmir"" and ""In the Light""."
3,Zeppelin meets death metal!,"I like this CD, although not as much for the pure musical talent, but more for the pure humor of it! Hearing guys/girls groaning and screeching Robert Plant lyrics to a heavy, driving rhythm guitar is awesome. If you listen to this CD with an open mind, it is actually pretty good. Tribute albums are best when the guest artists try to either exactly copy the original (which can't be done with Zeppelin) or play the song totally in their own style, which most of the bands do here. If you like Zeppelin and modern metal, you will like this album! (As good or slightly better than Ecomium.)"
2,Led Zeppelin black metal style - doesn't work,"I have been a die-hard Led Zeppelin fanatic for most of my life and have collected many LZ tribute recordings. This one is a disappointment. I just don't think Led Zep was meant to be performed in a death metal / black metal format. The only song on here really that I liked a lot was Kashmir - Silent Stream Of Godless Elegy. Communication Breakdown was OK, and Solus version of Rock and Roll - your basic double bass drums and super-fast riffs typical of music of the genre. Most of the rest of it - well, I'll just suffice it to say, I personally was disappointed with this release, but black metal fans (which I am not) might like it OK. The positive reviews on this CD look like they were posted by those who lean more towards the gothic style of rock."
4,A new experience,"This album is, quite frankly, hilarious. particuarly amusing were immigrant song, communication breakdown and rock and roll.Buy this album simply because it is completely ridiculous."
3,Good introduction,"A good, basic introduction to NLP (neurolinguistic programming) presuppositions, tools and strategies. Applies the ideas practically and communicates them with good examples in lay terms. I'd recommend this book for those who have no knowledge of NLP. Unfortunately, though, the book does not discuss the evidence-base of NLP which is often questionable. For example, NLP's belief that eye-movements can reflect internal representational system processing lacks significant research support. This lack of evidence base is a serious flaw for the critical thinker and one would want to explore deeper and broader literature on NLP. However, as far as self-help books go, this is better and more reasonable than many."
3,Just my opinion..,"..but I just feel indifferent about this CD. I bought it thinking it would be an orchestrated-type stuff, which it is but I was hoping for something I could relax to. Whenever I hear the music in this CD, I think of weddings. Don't get me wrong, it's a good CD, but just not what I was expecting (which was a more relaxing kind of orchestration)."
5,The greatest novel in the english language...,"Until recognizing The Recognitions, I batted back and forth between Ulysses and Gravity's Rainbow, not because I loved them, but because I recognized them as great. This, on the other hand was a revalation. The most staggeringly brilliant, engaging, funniest, loveable work of genius ever committed to the page."
1,full of himself.,the author is so full of himself. he uses so much adjective and he takes for-ever to get to the point. it's like listening to your english-major friend who has low self-esteem and uses big words often to try and impress you and you have already forgotten what he was trying to say in the first place. the story is just meh.
2,I made it halfway ...,".. before I gave up the book out of sheer boredom. I suppose the point of the book is a beat-inspired play on phonyness. Yawn. There's a lot (and I mean a LOT) of well-crafted pseudo-intellectual blather from major and minor characters that tries to move the story forward, but wordiness does not make a masterpiece. I still think it's important that, first, a novel describe - the who what when where - and much of the time I was even confused about who was talking, and to whom. Other reviews mention Ulysses, and Pynchon; well even in the thickest tangles of those works I knew what was going on. I'll probably reread this from time and pick up where I left off; I don't expect much revelation in the second half."
2,Ignore him,"I hate to rain on the Gaddis-is-God parade of reviews, but i tend to think that there was a reason he was so ""unjustly ignored"" for so long. i found this book intolerable reading as it reminded me of Thomas Wolfe and D.H. Lawrence at their worst. its filled with struggling, confused, self-obssessed artists making obscure references to second-rate classical music and irrelevant philosophies. the protagist is moody and obviously feels himself to be superior to everyone else (hence the comparison to Wolfe and Lawrence: two writers who thought too much of themselves), although personally i found him profoundly annoying. moments of vivid , grand imagery almost make this book worth reading, but doesnt quite save the book, for there are other writers who also paint strong imagery without the pretentious dialogue and postured writing style."
2,"Sorry, but it's outdated!","Recognitions is an important book no doubt, but it's so outdated. Read the TIME review of the book in 1955. It's on the money! Gaddis was 33 when he wrote it and in 1953 when I believe the book was written, he slams America for hypocrisy, Madison Avenue sellout (where have we heard that before?), the usual 'truths' that young people believe in until it's time to get a job just like Gaddis did. Read his bio. Just who was selling out? Anyway, try reading it. Maybe you'll like it. But I find that the America of the 50's is better captured in crime novels of the time as is my NYC."
1,Impossible to Enjoy,"Gaddis is certainly a gifted writer, but what he crafted here is impossible to enjoy on any level. 1000 pages of fragmented sentences, incomplete thoughts, non-interlocking, interlocking story lines and cameo characters simply does not cut it for a first rate work."
1,not the book - dalkey's pressing,the printing quality is atrocious. this 'dalkey archive' shows variation regularly on nearly every page of type by as much as 30 to 50% vertically and horizontal variance as well. i am not familiar with the different printing processes but this is unacceptable for anything other than an independent printing out of one's basement ... and Gaddis' The Recognitions should certainly not fall under this description. i will avoid dalkey archive pressings from now on out.
1,"the ""Dakley Archive"" version is slip-shod","For several years, Penguin had a version of this that was very handsome and professionally printed. It was in their ""Penguin Modern Classics"" line. Get that one if you can.THIS ONE, the one I'm trying to review: the ""Dalkey Archive"" one, the one that has a picture of a guy standing in front of a poster for a bullfight, was not printed professionally. It's like it's a knock-off copy or something! The paragraphs are not centered on the page. Not just here and there, but for hundreds of pages on end! It gets quite annoying. You've got 2 cm's of space from the text to the bottom of the page, but at the top two full inches between the text and the top of the page.Slip-shod work, gents."
3,Enjoyed it while it lasted,"This is very fun when it works. Not that durable. We have big and little kids and it broke the first week we had it, but we were able to fix it with some wood to keep the metal from bending. We did have issues with the score board keeping score whenever it wants to, but the kids love it anyway. If the price is on sale I would recommend it. The fact it has double baskets and the kids can compete is the best feature. Even the adults have fun competing."
1,SUCKS,This hoop set is not worth it's price! The backboard's screw measurements were way off from the bar's screw measurements. The arrows didn't work on both the original set and the replacement set. And the score board wires are way sensitive to the vibrations from the shooting that it turns off and on.
4,Great Price,"This was a gift for someone that is very sports oriented, so it was perfect for a game room. Although he had to replace the sensor through the company the product is great and works very well. The only thing that concerned me was the way it was shipped. Parts were falling out and the package was damaged. I reported this to amazon and they took care of it right away."
3,Good Product,My son and I use the double shootout hoop every evening. It works great and we have a little competetion going who scores the most. The only problem with the product is the electronic scoring system never worked from day one.
3,Damaged but still fun.,"The game came in a chewed up box, the corners of the backboard were smashed, a major loop for the canvas was ripped but all were pretty easily repaired. We used it for a corporate party, and for $100 we got exactly what we payed for, a little damaged but a hell of a lot of fun. I would probably buy again if using it for the same purpose."
1,Only half there!,"I purchased the Harvard Double Shootout only to find that when the box was opened about 1/3 of the parts were missing!! There were no bolts,screws, or wrenches, many of the support tubes were missing and there was no air pump."
5,Kick solid dirty anus EP,Well this was take from the tour of Transatlanticism. it's have 7 song (all live + an unreleased cover(...)
5,Everything Poetry Should Be,"No Heaven is a terrific book-- just what poetry should be: at once moving, because it touches old and deep knowledge, and new because it opens heart and mind again. Death is always present as real, heightening consciousness. Every poem contains ""a piercing glance into the life of things,"" as Marianne Moore said, a unity of soul and form. Ostriker reveals the horror and sacredness of everyday life by constantly reinventing the words believed to be ordinary, here transformed. Buy this beautiful collection and find yourself in no heaven but on incandescent eternal ephemeral earth -- the place to be human."
5,Beautiful,I love this bracelet and get nothing but wonderful comments when I wear it. This item was purchased from Amazon.com
5,Jazz guitar at its best!!!,"The title from the album, ""Summer night"" may mislead you. It only refers to the standard ""Summer Night"". Having said that, you'll discover Philip Catherine at his best, with more groovy tunes(""Tiger Groove""; ""Francis Delight"")and on the other side with more melodic tunes (I refer to the fantastic composition ""Letter from my mother"") But always you can recognize his typical guitar sound,which remains no matter what very melodic, with those typical hooks in his scales. As a guitar player myself, I admire him for his technique and his clear guitar sound but even more for his exceptionel talent as a composer. The CD is full of pearls, but you'll have to check it out yourself. Other references:Blue PrinceMeeting ColoursGuitar Groove"
4,Reading Voice,"In Revisiting Racialized Voice, Holmes tackles the difficult and elusive concept of black voice. The work begins with a clear and understandable, three-fold statement of the rhetorical intent in the Preface: to examine the relationship between literature, oratory and composition in the explication of black voice; to trace the evolution of black voice; and to afford black students more flexibility in constructing their own racialized ethos in writing(...)(...)Holmes by no means seeks to deny the subjective nature of black voice. Thus, in his own writing, he can neither deny, nor even escape, his own black voice and subjectivity. Nor would he want to. And any writer willing to put his own voice, and self, out on the table for examination and critique deserves credit, or, at the very least, a few appreciative readers."
4,Meet the robinsons,This is good fun and like the movie with the graphics. I havent played it by my nephew plays it a lot - 7 years
3,"Better than McRaven, but still SUCKED!!","To keep things simple, don't waste your money. Only Charles McRaven's book is worse than this. Live and learn I guess:-)"
5,Essential Picture Book,"If I had to recommend one single picture book, this would be it.My eldest daughter's favourite but loved by all my children. If we were away from home, we could always memorise the words easily.Big bold illustrations that are the perfect mix of being detailed without being too complicated for the very little ones. Just the right amount of words on each page.Only problem is that we have read it so often, the binding didn't hold, plus hard to get hold of in the book shops. This book is also a treasured favourite at many kindergartens."
4,Pretty,It's a pretty and well made toy. I don't think it's worth almost $10 but my girls seem to think it is. They love to get the bear and pegasus out when they watch the Barbie Pegasus movie.
3,Disappointed,"I thought this sports bra would give more support. It's ok if your just walking or doing a moderate workout. But, don't except this to hold anything in place if you are more active."
3,"Good, but not in the same class with Crystal Method","I listened to this CD the first time in my car, and I didn't enjoy it much (except maybe ""Limbo""). After getting home and putting on the headphones, however, my opinion changed. This Cd brings together a lot of different elements that makes for very interesting, if not imaginitive, listening. The big beats and breaks lead you out there, but in the end result in less than spectacular combinations. ""Limbo"" puts together the best of these elements and really shines. The rest of the Cd, however, leaves you somewhat satisfied, but longing for a little more consistant rythmic flow (something Crystal Method brought to virtually every song with great results)."
2,Boring,This album was a total let down. The beats were repetative and it completely lacked the intenstity and flow of The Crystal Method or Photek. It was honestly boring.
5,"Good Lord, what an album!","This is a genuine 5 star album. The beats are incredible and the two guys behind it are clearly musical geniuses. This album is every bit as good as the best electronic out there. If you're not sure if you're going to buy this album or not, buy it, you won't regret it."
5,Breakout album for two very tallented guy,"I was introduced to this album in 1999 and I was seriously blown away by the DnB/Acid Jazz/Punk fusion. It is truly musical, a hard to come by feature of electronic music. There are strong themes in this album, and no self-respecting electronic music fan, be it mainstream or eclectic should be without this album. Easily in my top 10 electronic music albums of all-time."
5,Finally! No rain in my car!,"I purchased the ventshades for my 97 Saturn SL2. These cars are extremely rounded and even with my windows rolled all the way up, I still managed to have some water dripping in and causing a mildew odor. Also, if it was raining even the slightest, there was no chance of venting my window for some fresh air without an active drip onto my arm. Installation was a breeze. I had them on in about 15 minutes, complete with lightly sanding the gasket I was attaching them to, and wiping it with alcohol. Now, I can have my windows open about 3 inches without rain entering. The mildew smell is gone! LOVE THESE!"
5,This book was exactly as I expected to be.,This book was exactly as I expected to be. The rest of this is just to get the minimum words required
4,"Great fun, clever and well written","If you can suspend your disbelief that Sherlock Holmes can be convinced that vampires exist, then you'll have great fun with this novel. Author Loren Estleman has done a good job in replicating the tone and style of the Conan Doyle stories, and the way that he uses Bram Stoker's novel as the background for this story is very clever indeed. As anyone who has read Dracula will know, Dracula is ""off-screen"" for most of the book and Estleman has used this to his advantage. So while the characters in Stoker's book are dealing with the consequences of the largely unseen Dracula's actions, Holmes and Watson are dealing with him directly in London.If you are a Holmes and Dracula fan, you should enjoy this book enormously. I had a great time reading it, and I definitely recommend it."
3,Harmless Fluff,"If you're looking for an amusing way to spend a few hours, you would do much worse than Holmes v. Dracula. Loren Estelman does a good job of capturing the spirit and language of the original Doyle series if the idea is somewhat hokey, the execution is not. The events of the novel intertwine with those in Bram Stoker's novel (indeed, Watson makes a point of lambasting Stoker for maliciously omitting mention of Holmes), but readers need only have seen any of the many Dracula movies to follow the characters. This is not a book that will enter anybody's top ten lists, but it is exactly what it appears to be - mindless entertainment."
5,When I noticed the title I was skeptical&#65533;.then I read the bo,"I had gone to my local bookstore to see if the most recent Sherlock Holmes story by Larry Millet was in yet. I happened upon ""Sherlock Holmes Vs. Dracula"". As much as I enjoy books about the great detective I was skeptical when I noted the title. Still, I decided to take a chance and purchased the book. What a find! My money was well spent. Holmes and Watson are matched against a totally different for than ever before. The plot moves along a good pace (or trot) and the author manages too never stretch into the unbelievable. I only regret the next Holmes story by this author will not be in print for a year. I am looking forward to it."
4,Closer and closer to the truth.,"""Jesus the Heretic"" is very well researched, clearly written, entertaining and informative. Anyone in search of their Christian roots and the truth behind Christian origins, will find interesting answers and hypothesis within these pages. Whether we agree with Lockhart's conclusions or not, the fact is that along with many other Biblical authors such as Eisenman and Wise, Schonfield, Smith and Thiering, we are getting closer and closer to the truth. Highly recommended."
1,Product description is wrong,"The Amazon description is wrong. In the one I saw, the ingredients list was pretty simple, with no artificial sweeteners or ""weird"" additives. What I received had a totally different ingredients list, including certain things which I don't eat (like sucralose/splenda). Product returned.J.Ja"
2,i never recive the milk & Egg protein,"I don't know why i didn;'t recive the product and you send me e-mail where you tell me i return back the product but i never see the product and you also charg me, i want to know why and i want this product becaouse anyway i pay for it and i needt it.I hope to get a answer from you because other way i will have some compplains about this situation and....in another placeGabiel"
1,"""Nutrition Facts"" omits the actual ingredients list","Amazon is listing ""nutritional info"" such as protein, calories, etc., but omitting the actual list of ingredients in these supplements. I would like to see what I will actually be eating should I use these, and that info is not available here.Note: the ""1 star"" awarded in this review does not reflect on this specific product, of which I have no firsthand knowledge. It's just that I couldn't post this review without choosing 1 to 5 stars."
3,Rough Guide to Israel,"The guide was basic and gave general information. Would have like to have more history on places of interest. But good over all guide. I found the Knolf guide excellant for history, architech, customs and arts of the area. A good refernance to Palestinian Territories."
5,An impressive and engaging debut novel,"The Rise Of The Phoenix is an impressive and engaging debut novel by Dawn Rivers Baker about the impending fate of an Empire, the dark force that menaces it, and the Prophecy surrounding two fraternal twins caught in the twists and machinations of grand schemes. A transcendent and splendor-filled work of high fantasy, The Rise Of The Phoenix is vividly descriptive and complexly woven, filled with intrigue throughout, and enthusiastically recommended reading."
5,Afrigo: The Ultimate Congo-Zairean Rumba Experience,"Afrigo is Uganda. Steamed matooke in banana leaf with a big Nile Special, the red clay, waragi at home with the elders, the most beautiful women in the world, the lake flies swarming around Lake Victoria...just as Lucky Dube has taken on the Caribbean reggae beat and brought it home to Africa, Afrigo has brought the four-step rumba back to the Rift Valley, where Man first made music...there is nothing like Uganda, there is nothing like Afrigo. Get ready to rumba."
4,History and Information,This is for the raw beginner to help him/her decide whether or not to study Judo. It is also for the advanced student to keep up with history and back ground of Judo formations. Well written and interesting to read. Ed
4,From an old hand.,Great book for the dedicated Judoka. Since I have been involved since 1965 reading it brought back many memories.
4,Mostly Good Choice in Stories.,"Most of the stories that were chosen for this anthology were masterpieces of horror and wonder, such as ""Colour Out of Space"" by H.P. Lovecraft, or ""Orange is For Anguish, Blue For Insanity"" by David Morrell, and so I must give high praise for this terrifying collection of horror's finest. But there are also some exceptionally bad stories that were included for reasons unknown, like the preposterous ""The Man With a Thousand Legs,"" by Frank Belknap Long, and a so-called Sci-fi story that excludes any real science called ""The Vaults of Yoh-Vombis,"" by Clark Ashton Smith. The inclusion of these two leaves me no choice but to deduct a star from what would otherwise have been a perfect rating. Four Stars. A must read, nonetheless."
3,Not bad; not great,"Some of the short stories in this collection are very good. ""Soft"" by F. Paul Wilson and ""Metastasis"" by Dan Simmons are excellent examples. Others like ""The Vaults of Yoh Vombis"" and ""The man with a thousand legs"" (sorry last reviewer) are exceedingly bad. My advice: if you find it on sale or used, pick it up and read a story or two in your spare time between novels."
5,What legends are made out of!!!!!,"This collection of hits is what legends are made out of!!!!! The kind of songs in this record are songs that artists dont make anymore these days.Beatrice really gives her heart and soul to these songs with her soothing, meloncoly,the kind of voice that just hypnotizes.Its crazy that you dont hear her anymore on tv or on the radio.She is certainly a true treasure to Mexican music and an artist who is long overdued a tribute or a recognition for her many years of hard work. I hope she starts recording again."
2,No me gusto la musica de banda,"Esta compilacion esta llena de musica con banda y me desilusiono, ya que esperaba que fuera mariachi y romantico solamente, me decepciono por completo, un poco caro el cd para las 4 canciones que trae reconocibles, le di 2estrellas ya que incluyeron musica con banda , mis favoritas aqui son"" mira nomas "" ""hasta cuando"" ""que vuelva"" ( a dueto con marco antonio solis ) y "" Arrepentida y Sola"""
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this car seat for my 6 month old son, based on reviews online and saftey tests. The car seat is beautiful, very plush and roomy, however, the crouch strap is too short making the leg straps too tight and they cut across my son's upper thighs. He is average height and weight and I do not understand how this isn't a problem for more buyers. The only way to prevent this problem is to loosen the straps and that is not an option because if the straps are not secure there is not protection in an accident. Needless to say I returned this seat and purchased a different brand. I would recommend to anyone considering this seat, go to a Target store, use the display model, put your child in the seat and adjust the straps to fit, just to make sure you do not encounter the same problem."
3,"Excellent seat, but not most cost-effective Britax","My daughter has been very happy to sit in this seat the last few years and it fits well in a compact car.However, now that she's hitting the height limit (40""), I wish I'd spent the extra $50 or so on the Marathon instead. We'll end up buying 2 new seats and THEN boosters, which is a big waste of money. If you can fit the Marathon in your car, I'd suggest getting that instead. Overall, I'm quite impressed with the Britax brand and would recommend it."
2,5 point harness system seems wrong! Agree with Chritina H,I just looked at this car seat tonight and I didn't buy it because of the short length of the buckle strap that goes between the legs. It is too short which would cause the hip straps to go across the legs/hip sockets instead of across the hip bones as recommended. I agree with Christina H. How can this possibly pass NTSB inspection? If anyone knows - boy would I like to hear it!!!!!
5,comfy chair,We own both the Roundabout & the Marathon. We use the Roundabout for travel as it is smaller for airplane seats. We are extremely happy with the Marathon. It has great plush material and our son loves to be in it. If we had known that the Marathon was a bit bigger we would have just got the Roundabout. But overall this is a fantastic seat.
2,Cartridge was defective,I purchased a twin pack of Ink cartridge for my Lexmark printer but the color (#35) cartridge was defective.
2,Richard A.,"I am unable to review the black cartridge since it has not been used yet. The Lexmark ""high yield"" color cartridge (#35) must have been considerably less than half full; I got less than 25 color copies from it. The regular #33 color cartridges I have always used in the past have always lasted much longer. I just hope the black #34 cartridge will have at least as much ink as the #32's I have used previously (as a ""high yield"" product, it should really be better)."
2,Lexmark Ink,Not sure what is wrong with this ink. But this is the third package I have gotten that when comes to end of black ink my printer starts telling me cartridge is missing or something is wrong with cartridges. But once I put in a brand new black cartridge everything is fine. Not really sure if I would recommend this or not. Ink works wonderful till last 1/4 of ink is in than just a mess an have to replace. But with how expensive ink is I would like to be able to use all the ink in cartridge.
1,Cartridge failure,"Color Cartridge failed after two uses, try to contact Amazon for a replacement, and their message was tough luck, I will not buy printer supplies from Amazon in the future"
2,lexmark ink cartridges,The black cartridge would not work until several attempts over a couple of days. The black cartridge did not come in a box and the color cartridge box was nearly crushed. I contacted the people that it was purchased from but no response.
4,Only issue,It seems to work well but just that if left unused for some time kindof dries up the ink a bit. Still would recommend it.
1,"non lexmark product shipped-wouldn't read ink levels,#34 wouldn't even align and print----NO GOOD","NON LEXMARK CARTRIDGES SHIPPED, WOULDN'T READ INK LEVELS , #34 WOULDN'T EVEN ALIGN AND PRINT, EMAILED 4 TIMES , FINALLY SENT ANOTHER #34, SAME PROBLEM, #35 HAS STAMP FROM "" UNITED STATES POASTAL SERVICE "" NEVER GOT A RETURN ANSWER!!!1RIPPED OFF"
1,LEXMARK CARTRIDGES #34 & #35,BOTH INK CARTRIDGES ARE MALFUNCTIONING!! BOTH ARE CAUSING THE PRINTER TO NOT PRINT. PREVIOUS PURCHASES WERE BETTER!!SMALL AMOUNTS OF INK CAN BE SEEN ON BOTH CARTRIDGES
4,Feel good about your body,"My previous experience with the Chic Simple range was the clothing books, with the clothing set out against a plain white background. This is not the case with this book. This is a sumptious exploration of the human body, organised in neat sections as in the other books. Will you learn anything you didn't know before. Probably not. Will you finish the book feeling good about the body within which you live. You probably will. If you are looking for a book to tell you how to change your body, this is probably not for you, but otherwise it is a worthwhile endeavour"
2,Buttstock attachment doesn't fit !!,"I bought this sling for my Maverick 88 and the attachment that slips over the stock doesn't fit! It is too small and the velcro straps that it comes with didn't feel too secure either. The quality is good and all but if the attachments don't fit, this sling is basically useless."
3,"Not bad, not good either.","First off, the straps seem pretty strong. However, unless your buying this for a small BB gun, the straps probably won't fit around your gun. the two straps that go around the butt didn't fit at all, and i only have a .223. after some sewing, they fit tho."
2,Fell apart my first game.,"For being a cheap sling I didn't expect much. I was happy with the sling itself until the end of my first day of use.Long story short I strapped this up to my SCAR and was suddenly shocked when my strap and swung off half my gun.It was the little metal pin that broke, the piece that seems to hold the opening and closing piece of the hooks together.These are loose cheap pieces of metal that were simply flanged at one end to hold them in place. One day and it popped right off.I was able to force this back in place and apply some strategic duct tape to put it back together.For what I paid, meh I suppose I got what I deserved. The fix worked but it should have lasted longer."
3,"A good sling, prefer single-point","This is a good sling, if you like this kind of sling... for my application (AK) I believe I would actually prefer a single point sling.You can buy this product knowing that it has a good strong build to it though, and one side of the strap has a non-slip rubber texture."
2,inexpensive sling=non usable sling,"Well, I bought this sling because of the low price. The old saying ""you get what you pay for"" rings true on this item. But I thought it was low cost, low risk venture. I don't understand why this sling has a rubberized coating on the stitching. It sticks to clothing and makes shifting your rig a pain when trying to use it as a three point sling."
4,I'm not sure...,"Love the sling, but just not sure how to use it correctly. I wish it came with better instructions as to the various ways to wear it. Minus 1 star for sub-par instructions. Good quality materials, plus the price is right. I used this with my AEG airsoft gun, but I can also interchange it with my real M4."
3,It works but not so comfortable,"The sling does what it is supposed to do. I did not use any of the other attachments that came with it.For the price, its good but it is a bit cumbersome to maneuver in. The straps have the non slip strips on it but that actually gets in the way. imaging trying to pull your gun up from side and then the strap pulling your shirt/jacket/(whatever you are wearing/not wearing) with it.It is not comfortable to use long term either. The edges are pretty sharp and that is what makes them a bit uncomfortable.Extra attachments did not fit my ps90 and was not really needed on my mp5-sd.Purchased a Magpul ms3 and that feels and works much better but for this price, you get what you pay for."
4,A little too tactical,"Sometimes it's hard to figure out what's going on with this thing. Other than that, it's very good. Comfortable, fun to attach, can be of great use when walking through tall grass and going through fjords. User = exactly average height and weight, Weapon = AK-47."
4,Decent sling,"I ordered this sling because it was inexpensive and I really needed a sling. It is not made of cheap material and has really strong clips at the end of each strap.It is easily adjustable and should fit all sizesIf you need a sling but are on a budget, this is the way to go"
5,Works just fine,"I received this item today on time and in new condition. I attached it to a Norinco SKS and with the multiple attachment options, any trouble I had with it was resolved by choosing a different method. I found it to be quite comfortable and easy to work with."
2,Not as advertised product,"The sling I received looks like the one advertised but is not the UTG pictured. The first clue is the packaging is very minimal and not like shown. Second clue, no UTG logo on sling itself. Third clue the clips on the one I got SUCK! They are nothing like pictured. Also there seems to be some kind of mold on the sling. I wiped it down with disinfectant...I just hope some crazy mold from China or wherever doesn't invade my house. No instructions, but I have found suitable pictures online. Other then that it seems functional. I wouldn't trust it on my $1k Bravo Co. AR so I threw it on my $215 Tec-DC9, it seemed sturdy enough in a moderate drop test on that. It's not worth the 12 bucks or whatever I paid for it to bother returning. I will try the UTG sling actually sold and shipped from Amazon next. With free super saver shipping it'll actually cost less. If I would have saw that option, I would have went that route."
2,BEWARE!!! SIZE MATTERS,Be careful depending on the size of your stock you may have an issue getting this on. Works great after doing some rigging but be careful. If you have a larger stock on the gun try using a 2 point and getting some blackhawk sling attachments
2,"Good textiles, inadequate metal hooks.","All the textile components are of good quality, but the hooks are metal with such a design that scrapes on the weapon and makes noise doing it. They are not robust enough for a real job. And they are not plastic AS IN THE PRODUCT PICTURES. The hooks are of the same type used on commercial shoulder bags."
3,Multi-functional equals overly cumbersome,"If you are looking for a bulky sling with several ""options"" this one is for you. If you are looking for a lightweight simple and easy sling - look elsewhere. Sometimes too much is just too much."
2,get what u pay for,well i thought i would get another high value item when i ordered this...It needs some work done on it. The positive is it's cheap and it has nice rubber runways on it. The only problem is for someone smaller your going to have 3 flat surfaces stacked on each other and when going to and from operator position the sling can get sperated and bound up in different ways. A lot of work and will be a grade A sling though. DONT BUY THIS if you dont want to do some work on it
4,A Perfect book for Novice Students,All those who want to make a solid base in this subject must study this book.This book has made each and evry concept of polymer science simple and easy to understand.The difficulties that students encounter in Polymer weight measurements have been dealt with beutifully and one can easily follow it.The concepts of isomerization and copolymers are also explained clearly. In all I can say that this book is worth reading otherwise you may miss something important in Polymer Science Engineering.
4,Excellent book,An excellent book covering a broad range of relevent topical matter. Good for both undergrad and graduate level reference and problems.
2,The Elements of Polymer Science & Engineering,"Does a good job with the science and presents it concisely. However, fails miserably on the applications end."
2,meh,"Not a fan, but my father-in-law really, really, really loves it.This is classic 1940s-50s swing and big band stuff."
4,Perhaps not all his greatest - but still brilliant,"This album, collection of Zulu and English songs by British born, South African adopted, music legend Johnny Clegg captivates many of his great music over the last 25 years.Clegg's highly contraversial partnership with Sipho Mchunu was unsuprisingly often politically charged but always faithful and appreciated. Such tracks that illustrate this and often bring tears to the eyes of South-Africans the world over are Asimbonanga, Great Heart and Africa.However I do not believe this is his best compilation album. If you would prefer to find a better Johnny Clegg collection, then you may wish to give ""In My African Dream"" or ""Premium Gold Collection"" a listen. They include songs such as Ibhola Lethu, Siyayilanda and Third World Child - that were unfortunately ommited from this album.If you don't know Johnny Clegg - then you are missing a lot. Give him a try: this album is a good introduction."
1,The Cone Personal Massager,This is not what I expected for the money it cost. It's cumbersome and gets in the way! This is not worth the money.
1,Garbage,"Biggest waste of money worthless piece of crap. Getting bottom off to install batteries was like pulling teeth. DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
4,Fun once you get the hang of it!,"Bought it cause of the hype, and would have to say, the desired result was achieved! Squirted the first time using it! Here are a couple negatives: a bit cumbersome to maneouvre, and gets in the way if you know what I mean. Also, the base opens easiest by placing it on a flat surface and turning the top, NOT by following the directions. Not for those who are concerned with privacy, there is no mistaking what you are up to... I've only had it up to the third setting, and am concerned that the higher settings might just shear 'it' clean off! Needless to say very powerful and cool looking, the BF loves it, and so do I!"
2,Unable to open.,"I would love to say that I enjoy this product... but as a previous person stated, it is impossible to get the batteries in it. I tried multiple time to open it and for multiple days, but have yet to unscrew the battery compartment. I am really disappointed. If I am ever able to get the batteries in, I will update on the actual performance of the product."
1,is there an option for no stars??,I had very high expectations for this amazing looking invention but it is horrible. What is this really? It may have just been me but I couldnt feel a darn thing. Please dont waste the money. It is a great conversation starter though :)
5,"AWESOME, does it all","great build, high quality and very strong motor, adjustable settings, this thing has been running like a champ, sucks batteries, but get rechargeable ones!"
3,Very cool but takes some fiddling,"Neat toy, however in my case, while i found it interesting at first; it did not wow me. As time went on and I fiddled with my cone the sexual experience was better. So, for some people it has been wow right out the box and for others, like me it has taken a bit of fiddle'n and some time.(Hint positioning angles and pressure) Alight all enjoy your new hands free ride. Final cone rating 3 1/2 stars.PS: I love the fact that you can leave it in plan sight and no one (so far has noticed)"
2,OK but not for the price,"I kept seeing this and out of curiousity I wanted to try it. I wasn't that impressed with it once I got it. It's noisy and I couldn't ""finish"" the job without using another object. I guess it's ok for couples but as a solo act, I was not impressed."
2,Eh....not so amazing...,"Based on the reviews I thought this would be great -- I've been looking for a new vibrator and I wanted one that didn't penetrate deeply. The cone definitely fits this description but it was pretty disappointing in reality. It does have a lot of settings but I wasn't able to complete the job on any of them. It might be nice for a little bit of light stimulation while I surf the net, but its definitely not something that can rock my world."
3,I really like it but...,"Once you get the batteries in, it is a great vibrator. It is a bit loud but since I live alone the noise is not a problem. The problem is unscrewing the bottom in order to insert the batteries. I have small hands and found it absolutely impossible to unscrew. I finally gave up after two hours of trying. I had to have someone else unscrew the bottom for me (and that was a bit embarrassing.)"
4,Wonderful,"One of Macaulay's ""theses"", that war destroys art, would later be proven wrong in a few years time by the war poets, but that does not detract from the novel itself. Her background in journalism is evident in the frankness of her prose, which has an austere sort of beauty to it."
2,Falls off easily,"I have worn wigs before, and they stayed on. This one fell off within a minute. It was deformed, flat on top and poofed out on sides. Looked horrible on. So I am returning it."
3,Here's an Interesting Story,"Last week, I was on the stage crew for a student production of the show here at University of Michigan. It was quite an interesting experience. Most of the cast were musical theater majors who had great voices. You'll definitely find the tunes in the show catchy. Most of all, there is no way you can watch this show without having some memories about you high school days."
2,"If you like warm, not hot, coffee....","Then this is the coffee maker for you. It's easy enough to use, a bottom-of-the-line model with no bells and whistles, but with 4 annoying flaws.The worst is that the coffee never comes out hot -- it's at an easy-to- drink heat that's not hot enough for me. Second, the heating plate doesn't keep the coffee hot enough. Third, there's no automatic shutoff, a nuisance. Fourth, the carafe drips a lot when it's poured at any but the slowest rate."
1,"Where did you go, Mr. Coffee?","Alas, Mr. Coffee, you are causing much strife in my household. At this very moment, my wife is saying ""I hate you."" We had one of your ancestors, and loved it, right up until the carafe broke. So, we bought you. Where to start....1) There is a single lid, hinged in back, that lifts up and back. This lid covers both the grinds and the fresh water tank. So, after brewing, if you lift the lid, crud drips back into the fresh water tank. This is ok if you enjoy cleaning the *entire* maker every day.2) Even if you don't lift the lid immediately, some grounds still get thrown into the fresh water tank.3) The maker itself is bulkier than the older models.I guess that Mr. Coffee had to reduce costs somehow to keep their basic model under twenty dollars.Bottom line. Don't waste your money on this guy. Dimaggio he ain't."
1,The Worst!,"This is absolutely the worst coffee maker I have ever used. If you like really weak coffe, then it might be ok. I like fairly strong coffee, and this maker pushes the grounds over the filter and into the pot every time! It also drips when you pour."
1,Stopped working and I am thankful,"This coffee maker is disliked by many because of a few problems with the lid, the way the water goes through the coffee, and the basket, all which tend to make the coffee weaker than it ought to be. That wastes a lot of coffee! So when mine quit yesterday, after only a few months of poor operation, I was not too displeased, for today I shall head to K Mart and pick up a new one, of a different brand."
3,a bit dull,"This book is written in a style that is definitely boring, but it is enhanced by scattered pictures of Virginia Woolf, her friends, husband and family members. The content is very informative, however the style of writing leaves alot to be desired."
1,.....puh,"The person responsible for letting this CD out to the public should walk off a cliff, while plummeting to his impending death, impale himself with a blunt, rusted pole, then eaten inside out by a tape worm."
3,Not impressed,"I was disappointed that the top of his head is cut off in the picture. Also, I paid an extra fifty dollars to make sure I got the product on time. I was expecting it in 3 business days and didn't receive it until 5 days. I missed being able to give my husband his birthday present on time. I could have got the same picture and bought a frame for thirty dollars instead of about the one hundred I spent. I would never tell my husband how much I spent on this picture!"
2,Not a big fan,This book might speak to you but it didn't speak to me. I did get a few good ideas but overall I didn't like the approach. Too much on the author's experience and not enough on mine.
1,Still smoking,Not very well-written. I'm still smoking....I wish there would have been more Buddhist principals included. I wouldn't recommend it as a stop-smoking tool.
4,Foor for thought,"I am not a die hard holistic follower so I found some of the advice a littel too extreme for my personal taste. Although, while extreme, if definitely provides food for thought."
3,Over-rated,"I was expecting more from this book. Thought it would have more actual homeopathic remedies and natural cures than it did. The author does give some useful tips (cod liver oil, pressure points) but overall it was a lot of what we already know - that nature is best."
3,not a watercolor book,"this a very good book, with examples of beautiful, unusual work from various artists, including the author. but, if you, like me, thought the watercolor on the cover is the author's work, you will be disappointed. most of the work shown is done with colored inks and acrylics, or opaque mediums. i have been inspired, but because of the cover, also misled."
3,not one of his best,"This show is not even close to Brutal Planet,his band is not near as good as they are in Montreux or Brutal Planet they seam to be in a hurry to get this show done.And how many times do you have to play School's Out.This disk is not that good."
4,A nice update to the Basie sound.,"I enjoyed this album. Bob clearly did his homework in crafting the arrangements of classic Basie tunes. He didn't just copy Basie charts, but added a little ""Mintzerizing."" He also contributed some original compositions. 'Having Some Fun' is right in the Basie pocket, but 'Home Basie' departs into a funk groove -- it's a nice change of pace. I also like the recording -- direct to 2 track. We're getting a live performance from the studio here, not a multitracked, perfected, punched in thing. If you want to hear the Basie orchestra, buy a Basie CD. But if you like the Basie style and want to hear a tasteful modern take on it, buy ""Homage to Count Basie"" and enjoy!"
2,Uninspired Performance,"I just can't get excited about this CD. The band appears to ""phone it in"" without much life. Granted, the Basie orchestra didn't play with the fire that Buddy Rich's or Woody Herman's bands did; that wasn't their style. But they always swung with that reknown ""Basie bounce,"" which is sorely missing here. The musicianship is there, but not the emotion. Bottom line: want to hear some good Basie tunes? Skip this one and grab a Basie CD. Recommentations: ""Best of Count Basie: The Roulette Years"" and ""Live at the Sands (Before Frank)."""
1,Over engineered,"Obviously, a lot of work and engineering went into this Stellarscope but for practical purposes it's nearly useless."
4,Detailed,"The details in this book is amazing, it has the references to some of the most common questions and those that go beyond, for the beginner it has helpful knowledge and for the experienced it is great to go back to get some tips or guides."
5,Strawberry Shortcake excellent book for collectibles,"... *** This is an excellent book for the serious Strawberry Shortcake collector of ornaments, musicals, jewelry & hair accessories, books, puzzles, cards & gift wrap, party supplies and more. There were 3 Strawberry Shortcake books produced, there is one for dolls called ""More Strawberry Shortcake"" if you are looking for doll information. This book has 'no' doll information but was not intended to, it is called the ""Cream"" of Strawberry Shortcake because it is the cream of the crop when it comes to these special items. This book does in fact have many rare items in it, I have been a serious collector for years and use this book as a great guide for ebay almost daily. Would very highly recommend it if you are interested in those type of items that I listed above would be in it. It has wonderful photos of these highly collectible items. Good luck with your collecting!"
4,Much better then the first two.....,"Well, she's getting there. This book contains a great background section and tribute to the doll collector who has been providing all the information and items shown in the books photos (Jennifer of Strawberry Shortcake Central). Dolls, minis, and toys are not included in this collector's rendition. Instead, Schiffler focuses on pretty much every other SSC item that was created. I thought this book was amazing and didn't realize how many other creations there were bearing the Strawberry Shortcake logo and theme; everything from clock radios, purses, ornaments, the many books and comic books, furniture, and much more."
5,Seeing what there is to see...,"Young Janny has a very important job helping her dad run the snowplow through their rural town in Maine. She's the wingman, responsible for raising the right wing of the plow to avoid their neighbors' mailboxes.Postier's illustrations elicit the warmth and closeness between father and daughter in this snowy landscape where adventure and opportunity around every corner.In this sweet, quiet book, young readers will learn about life in rural northern Maine, and will see what there is to see on a snowy winter's night. Look for special animals throughout, and for the kind of illustrative details that make a book like this special. It's from Boyds Mills Press, a publisher famous for creating books you'll want to save for your kids' kids. This is one of them."
3,Thorough but outdated reference book,"This book provides a compilation of articles, some previously published, on the material properties of various group III nitride semiconductors such as GaN, InN and BN. Multiple phases are covered where applicable, such as cubic, hexagonal and wurtzitic BN. The book is broken up into chapters, each of which focuses on a specific topic of the nitrides as a whole. These chapters include fabrication, mechanical properties, thermodynamics and phase changes, electro-optical properties, and surface properties. The range of topics covered is very broad for the different nitrides, and the references included in each section provide a good resource for further research. Overall, a good book though it is outdated now and I would recommend against purchasing it."
4,Great Value,My niece loves this play hut (and so does the family cat!). I expected the price to be higher - it's a great value!
3,Toddler still too young to Enjoy!,This product seems fine but my 17 1/2 year old nephew is just still a bit too young for it I think. he got a bit scard in the tent-maybe when he gets older it will be a bigger hit!
2,Looked great-- ended up being flimsy.,"I bought this toy for my 18 month old son thinking-- wow, the perfect blend of Elmo and imagination. He and I could hardly get it out of the box so that he could start playing and hiding out in it. Unfortunately, it hardly stood on its own. This tent is extremely flimsy and hardly worth the twenty dollars spent on it. In the spring we'll try setting it up outside and do our best to secure it with our own stakes so that it will (hopefully) stand. The lesson I learned is if it's too good to be true... it probably is."
5,LITTLE woman with BIG message,I met Patsy last year (2006) at the Women of Faith conference and later bought all books available by her! She knows what it's like to hurt and be fearful big time--yet she knows how to take care of those feelings! A most wonderful person and author.
4,"Growing up Little, but finding a big God","Patsy has such a way with words that you could ""hear her speak"" through her book. I only wish she had focused more on the ""how"" she overcame the agoraphobia rather than so much history related to her family. But I loved it nonetheless and have already recommended it to others."
4,I Grew Up Little,"This book was a good read. However, I expected to learn more about Ms. Clairmont's agoraphobia. That was the reason I had bought the book. Still, if you enjoy biographies, this one is fun to read."
4,SOFT soapdish,"I like that it won't break when dropped. It's a soft rubber. It's clear. The bumps are raised.It might be difficult to clean soapscum/slime out of this dish without leaving marks if you use a brush to clean it. (Not using it to hold soap.)It's currently at the kitchen sink holding a sponge. (Gasp! For those people who hate sponges! My husband, who does the dishes, likes sponges--which I change often.) It keeps the sponge high and dry.We like it so far.We will be buying another soon. (When you find something you like, it's best to buy a back-up before they quit making it.)"
1,Interdesign carcigen plastic soap dish,"Interdesign ""29300 Soapsaver Dish Rectangular - clear"" flexible, plastic soap dish; from product label: ""This product contains a chemical known to the Sate of California to cause cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm"". While I like the dish, maybe its the ""product contains a chemical"" that gives off a REALLY BAD SMELL that I try to town down with anti-disinfectant sprays -- and the smell just does NOT go away after repeated treatments! And I bought 5 of them before learning of this disgusting chemical-smelly problem."
2,Needs drainage holes,"It's what it promises to be, but because there is no drainage (which I had assumed from the picture was there) it still manages to marinate my soap in a pool of water until it turns to mush. Even worse, the little nubs then sink into the mushy soap and it dries into sharp shards. I may take scissors to it to see if I can fix the problem, but I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Fail,This would be a good product if it had drain holes in it. As it is the water just pools in the tray and kind of defeats the purposes of using the tray in the first place.
3,it ok,"It works as a soap dish. But it could use a drain. The water builds up inside the dish which you have to dump. Not the end of the world, but with an easy whole in the bottom corner it can drain all on its own."
2,Jizzy Can Still Belt It Out,"""Let's Eat"" is a must for all Love/Hate fans, and it makes me wonder what would have become of the group had they stuck together in their original form. Gone is principal songwriter Skid, and it shows in the songwriting. Where ""Blackout"" and ""Wasted"" had maybe one or two 'filler' tracks, this one is mostly filler tracks. ""Don't Play Your Guitar While You're Talkin' To Me"" would have sounded good as a b-side to one of their earlier albums, but doesn't really live up to the band's early standard. Still, it gives us a newer sounding Love/Hate with rhythmic vocal delivery that borders on rap but doesn't fall into the category of Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park. That means I can still like it. Real rock and roll, Jizzy Pearl style, and his voice is worth the price of admission."
3,"Not their Best Effort, But...","I listened to this a few days before I bought it, so I really can't complain. If you're a true L/H fan, then buy it. If you just have Blackout and Wasted - then don't bother. It falls more into the dark genre of their later attempts. If these really appealed to you (Let's Rumble, I'm not Happy), then I guess you're in for a treat."
3,3.5 not L/H's best,"at this point the band was in disarray. The first 3 tracks are pretty killer, but has a few filler tracks as well. I would start with 'red Room' or 'Wasted...' if a new listener."
4,"Neat little piece, but only from the front.","I like it, I got it as a part of a Halloween costume and overall I'm pretty happy with the item for that purpose, but I didn't notice from the picture that it was one sided, hollow in the back, so that may be an issue for some people looking to buy this.Overall not bad though, I'll probably buy more pieces from this seller."
3,"not her best, an added note","I realize that I have most of these songs in other CD albums. Morgana is not at her best here. Her interpretation does not show off her hypnotic voice. Her CD album, ""A Taste of Honey,"" is still the best and one to have andlisten again and again, in fascination. It must be Torrie Zitto's arrangement. Her bacchanial interpretation of ""The Night Has A Thousand Eyes,"" and the sensitive ""Easy Living"" are gems. Pardon my punctuation.I just got the CD album from Amazon. I didn't realize that it is a compilation of 3 albums, It's a Quiet Thing, Wild Is Love, and Gemini Changes. The first and second album,I had already bought from Amazon as single CDs. The third is not available."
2,mediocre overview,"I flipped through this book before buying it, so I should have known what I was getting, but still I was disappointed. The discussion of the languages is pretty elementary. I was hoping that the discussion of game libraries for the various libraries would be of value, but the selection presented is much smaller than you can easily find online - and being a book, the information presented is out of date, too.Additionally, there are some pretty atrocious editing errors, including syntax errors in the code that completely obscure the point being made, as well as figures incorrectly matched with their respective captions.It's not ALL bad, though. There are a few examples here and there that changed the direction of how I considered using Python in games."
3,nothing about how to program the game itself,"Its really a shame that most beginning game programming books use C++ or some obsure languages like unheard of flavors of BASIC and ignore the prevelence and ease of use of modern scripting languages. This book is not for beginning programmers, it just introduces these 3 scripting languages and then throws some game code in the back of the chapter for each."
2,Why 3 languages?,"I had assumed that I would be reading a book about combining the 3 languages to create a game. First I wanted to know why. I was distracted by the Pygame section, as I've been readingBeginning Game Development with Python and Pygame: From Novice to Professional. In comparing just the Pygame coverage, Beginning Game Development with Python and Pygame is 20x better. There is no reason to have Game Programming with Python, Lua, and Ruby. There isn't sufficient enough coverage on any one language to get a grasp, and if you're already familiar with one or all of the languages, you have to wade through all the newbie stuff to get to the meat. Where is the bibliography? The author describes several facts with no evidence such as a bibliography would provide."
5,My girlfriend says it's the best she ever used,we use this during our course of love making. The first one she owned lasted almost 8 years with regular use so we bought another. She says she has used many vibrators over the years and nothing compares to the eroscillator. Extremely intense orgasms.She sometimes uses it solo for a quickie. I can tell it delivers intense orgasms for her. Its use has become a routine.
2,nice style but feel cheap,"I love Serengeti glasses, I have a great pair that has glass lenses and will stick with them. The PolarMax are all plastic and do not have the same lenses as my others. They also didn't fit right as they had a tilt to them."
2,Simpsons game -not much fun,"This is an ok fun game, I'm stuck and cant go forward or backwards in the game... not sure how to play the game in order to win and get past where I am"
4,Fun and challenging!,"I am an adult gamer and decided to get this game based on the reviews here.Sure enough, it is fun and challenging. You never lose lives. I had alot of fun playing it. Some parts were hard but I got over it after some practicing. You have to collect all the coins, papers and cliches. I completed the game but got only 97% because I wasn't able to get all the items I needed. There were times I wanted to go back after seeing that I missed a coin over there, but once you across a certain point, you cannot go back. Unless you want to start over again on that certain level.It is rated T due to mild language. It is almost easy enough for kids but due to the language they had to rate it a 'T'.The game does save where you left off. Graphics are great & colorful, just like the TV cartoon.Recommended for those who want a silly, fun and kind of short game."
4,Really Great Game!,"This is a really good game. Its funny, and interesting. The thing is this game is way to easy and has no challenge at all. So if you know your a experienced gamer then dont buy it if you like challenging games. But otherwise this game is great and highly recommended."
4,if you love the simpsons....,"I'm going to be very blunt.You cannot die in this game. There are unlimited lives. Some of the levels get pretty difficult and frustrating. (So unlimited lives is a good thing. But leaves no REAL challenge.)The animations are good and the dialogue is funny and its pretty easy to just pick the game up and start playing. There are quite a few unlockables. And a really cool feature of the game is the ability to visit the theater and replay any cutscenes/animations you have unlocked in the game.Another cool feature is PET HOMER which is moderately funny. (it's not a complete mini game, its more for a quick laugh.)I'd recommend this for fans of the simpsons, as most of the things that make this game great are things that not the average person would appreciate this game for."
2,In the words of Lisa Simpson... meh...,"This game isn't that great. It violates my one big pet peeve - repetition of the same challenge over and over if you don't get it right the first time. The best part about this game is the dialogue, but even that gets repetitive when you've repeated a level about 25 times. Also, it feels like the characters don't respond well to the controller, which means you are pressing those tiny DS buttons really hard and your hands get bad cramps. Last, in many cases there is absolutely no direction as to how you are supposed to complete the challenge, so you really end up doing it a ridiculous number of times (Lisa and the dolphins almost made me chuck the thing out the window!). If you want a good Simpsons game, I enjoyed the Xbox game ""Hit and Run""."
2,Somewhat boring,"""The game was fun only for the first time, once you finish it, it gets boring"" That's accourding to my children."
3,simpsons the hysteria,When I first heard about this game the thing I thought about was the movie so I was really hyped to get the simpsons game for my ds so I finally bought it so now I am 99% complete and I think that yes it is fun but on the on other hand the plot line is thin and ludicrous I played it a lot but it just didn't have that simpsons style I mean come on meet with god to save your world that was the best plot they could come up with as for the gameplay it looks as if the simpsons are walking stick figures that really don't do anything unless you press a button witch is a little strange but I really tried to love it just wasn't what I was looking for but I really like the short movies and some of the game backgrounds anyways here are the pros and cons
2,Ultra Sheer Cankles,The fit of these nylons was good everywhere but the ankles. The material pooled up unattractively right above my foot after only a few minutes of wearing the hose. I purchased the correct size for my height/weight. Maybe this pair was a fluke.
3,Too Good to be True? You bet.,"An orchestral arrangement of the best tracks from the series? The prospect alone was music to fans' ears, especially when it was shown that Final Fantasy VII (arguably the best soundtrack of them all) would finally get a fair shake in the arrangement arena.Unfortunately, the orchestra that was promised never seems to materialize on the CD, and what we're left with is a collection of generally shoddy synth music performed by ""The Electric Sound Ensemble."" It's a wonder that the Ensemble were able to reduce Nobuo Uematsu's powerful melodies, like that of ""Cosmo Canyon,"" to grating mediocrity. A select few tracks (Main Theme of FFVII, Tina) do manage maintain their appeal, but only because of their near-identical structures to that of their soundtrack counterparts.Overall, while fans of Uematsu's work will not find much to be happy about, the general listener will discover some very compelling music... even in the watered-down form offered by this U.S. release."
4,For a True Final Fantasy Fan,"From your first visit to the Chocobo Village, to the never-ending battles between good and evil, this CD Track is unique as the game itself. From the upbeat ""Chocobo Theme"" to the quaint Theme Song, this is a c.d. that you won't regret buying!"
2,STAY AWAY!,"As an avid fan of game music, I was looking forward to listening to this CD. That was my first problem. Although the CD says ""hollywood symphony orchestra"", 99% of it is performed by the ""Electronic Sounds Ensemble."" The first track wasn't that bad, and the second is listenable. The third just plain sucked. After that, the CD goes downhill with a horrible Prelude and a hollow rendition Main Theme of FFVII. Then comes Cosmo Canyon, which isn't all that bad. After that, its Shinra Wages a Full Scale Attack, with brass that sounds better on my MIDI synth. Then comes the worst part of the CD: Liberi Fatali. It starts out with a horrible soprano who doesn't even sing the right words. That soprano is replaced by a synth shortly afterwards. God help us. After that, its a lifeless version of My Mind, an OK version of The Spy, and an flat, boring version of Mods de Chocobo. Bottom line, do yourself a favor and avoid this CD."
1,A Tribute to SHAME,"I pray that nobody experiences Final Fantasy for the first time on this CD, for they would be given the completely wrong impression. Nobuo Uematsu's beautiful songs have been packaged up in some garbage MIDI format, and no doubt sold to capitalize on FF's rising popularity. I have downloaded better MIDIs for free, which I would much rather listen to than this CD again. The choice of tracks is very average--hardly ""The Best"" that Final Fantasy has brought us. I suppose it's a blessing in disguise, for when I listened to how it has butchered ""Liberi Fatali,"" I was glad it left more of my favorite songs alone. Don't let the cheap price fool you. This CD is poor."
1,Couldn't bear listening to it!,"I listened to this CD one time, and after flipping through the tracks to see if there was something good, I painfully turned my cd player off and never listened to it again. This CD does no justice to the wonderful music composed by nobou umaetsu for the final fantasy series. You're better off listening to MIDIs of the music from the games than buying this CD. The vocals seemed to be very off, the instruments didn't sound real, and it sounded like someone made this cd in a couple of hours. I don't reccomend this CD to anyone unless you need a new frisbee!"
4,I don't care! It's cool,"I don't see why some people are complaining about this C.D. I have played Final Fantasy a million times! Sometimes I leave the game on just to listen to the music. I don't see how someone, who loves Final Fantasy, wouldn't get this C.D! So if you love the magical sounds that spew from the game that is Final Fantasy, you should get this!"
1,"The name ""final fantasy"" doesnt deserve to be put on this","...Yes. Why are the words ""final fantasy"" put on this? This Cd Absolutely stinks. the 1st track is okay, which is the only thing good. The Song ""liberti Fatalli"" STINKS. i expected it to sound like the Ost's version, but i was obviously WRONG! (There is definitely something else to the song htan Fa-su {which is reapeated over and over} ) SO DONT BUY IT! IT URTS YR EARS!!"
3,Its ok,I love the Final Fantasy series. And when I bought this I found a simple arangement of music played by an orchestra. I was sumwhat dismayed by this. I wanted direct songs from the game played by the orginial players. But nevertheless you get what you pay for.
1,I wish I could give this 0 stars.....,"This cd has so many problems, I don't even know where to start. First, to the biggest disgrace of all--Liberi Fatali...I loved that song on the game, then on the OST when I bought it. Then I hear this...'song'. (And I use that term loosely). They're not even singing the right words!! More like they're just mumbling. Secondly, many people wondered why they decided to perform those songs, and not popular songs like ""Aeris' Theme"". Well, after analyzing the tracklist, and looking back to the FF6,FF7, and FF8 OSTs I have, I realized that they just played the first song from each cd! So much for musical inspiration...The other songs were bearable at best. No where NEAR the quality of the originals...But hoping for a great finale with ""Mods de Chocobo"", I am sickened by this flat, dull, song. Do yourself a favor, don't waste 10 dollars on this cd."
1,The saddest attempt at a musical tribute I've ever heard.,"Where to even begin? How about with false advertising! This cd has been touted as being performed by the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. Yeah. This CD is synthesized through and through, and not even well-synthesized. This album is a prime example of how *not* to arrange the music of Final Fantasy. It's a complete bastardization of Nobuo Uematsu's work, and I can only hope that the man himself is aware of it and will not allow it to happen again. I have no words to describe how awful this disc is. If you want to listen to Final Fantasy music, do yourself a favor: Get the original soundtracks. Maybe someday someone will see the errors with this CD, and correct them with a new album, hopefully with a real symphony this time instead of teasing us with promises that can't be kept.A severe missed opportunity."
2,Ok for a beginner collector,"To compare this CD to the Japanese CDs out there, it would be blown to bits. It stinks comparatively to the import collections. But, if a person does not have any of the orchestrated imports, then this cd would be a good buy. It is cheap and holds most of the important melodies of the main Final Fantasy games. This is a good beginner's cd, but if a person has any of the imports, stay away from this one...it is a BIG disappointment."
3,LIES-LIES-LIES YEAH!,"You know I have been pondering on what to review next and I remembered a good thriller I had not seen in a long time LIES Lies is a underrated HORROR that stars Ann Dusenberry as an actress fired from a SLASHER film for not exposing her breasts.(""I'm an actress,not a stripper,""she yells and the producer screams THIS IS A ....... HORROR FILM YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM)She then is hired to star in a movie about a mad woman and the plot twist predates both BODY DOUBLE & DEAD OF WINTER this is a enjoyable film with a cast of underappreciated thesps.BEST SCENE: The hanging in the elevator shaft"
3,Solar Shields,"I would be much happier with the glasses if they were offered in a size. They were not, so I guess they are large. They are too big, slip down and give me a headache."
5,Items As Advertised,The Solar Shields were delivered as promised and as advertised. I would recommend them to anyone needing something to wear over their prescription glasses.
5,I didn't put it down.,Mr. Kinrade puts a real-life possibilty into play here with superb description. I totally enjoyed it!
4,An excellent novel,"AS A MEMBER OF THE MARITIMES, I WAS HAPPY TO READ THIS BOOK. BEING ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE PLACES MENTIONED ALLOWS ME TO BRING A NEW MEANING TO THIS BOOK. THE DRAMA AND THE REAL LIFE QUALITIES OF THE CHARACTERS COMPARES TO TOM CLANCY AND KEITH DOUGLASS."
3,Slow Starter,"Spoilers! The premise was good, but took forever to get started. I still cannot see any Navy in the world operating a deep water submarine in the St. Lawrence Seaway. But at least the USA saved the day!"
5,Useful for Workouts :D,"No issues, haven't used if for any labor but it should be able to deal damage to whatever you swing it at. I use it to work out and it has served me well for that purpose."
2,Handle just Broke,"Must say I'm dissapointed. The ""hardwood"" handle just broke within 5 min of using it, no joke. I looked on the lable and it says it's from a renewable forest (which means the trees grow fast, which means it's not that hard). Utter dissapointment. Seems like it would be a great product if it weren't for the low quality handle."
3,More like 2 & 1/2 stars...,"I'm a HUGE Symphorce fan, but to be honest I just can't get into this CD to save my life! I tried to listen to it many times & it just doesn't click with me...the problem?? They tried too hard to make the perfect yet intricate album & as a result the album just sounded overproduced with no feeling. After the very first good Symphorce album the band tried to find their own sound with each & every release, but here with 'Twice Second' their 4th album, the band hits another slump like with their 2nd CD 'Sinctuary.' If you want power metal mastery from this band, pick up their debut 'Truth to Promises,' their 3rd CD 'Phorceful Ahead,' their 5th CD & so far their BEST 'Godspeed' & their newest offering 'Become Death.'"
4,A look at the faith and everyday lives of ordinary Mormons,"Mormons often lead lives that are a little different from those of their non-Mormon neighbors. By tracing the activities of one congregation in Maryland for 1 year, the author gives us a look at the lives of everyday Mormons. Set against the events of the congregation, many members of this ward tell us about their beliefs in and doubts about Mormonism, and the place the church has in their lives and relationships. This is the best book I have read to understand what it is like to live as a Mormon in contemporary America. The author has honestly and openly chronicled the joys and frustrations, the faith and the doubts, the rewards and difficulties of these members of the Mormon church.I found this book fascinatng, although now and then I felt like a voyeur into the lives of these people because they were so open about their feelings."
5,It's excellent! but where's its DVD?,"I like Cyndi very much since I watched this show 13 years ago, Is it possible to let me enjoy this show in my home theater environment with DVD version?"
5,"great video, great price.",Another great performance from non other than pure cyndi..great item for the cyndi collector!!!.
5,Great Show,"Boy, I wish this was on DVD. There are some outstanding performance on this. She's goofy airhead, but boy she can sing."
1,Inferior,Inferior product.They arrived on time and were well packaged. The bulb was not correctly seated in its track and was stuck to adjacent metal parts. The bulb stuck to the door and split.They contacted me for my comments but never responded; they did not attempt to rectify the problem.
1,Nit Wit is more accurate,"Anyone who has heard or read her shameful remarks at the Houston Astrodome after hurricane Katrina already has a pretty good idea of the ""wisdom"" of this lame brain.If we can judge by the apples that have fallen from this tree, she would be better off applying an additional dose of fertilizer to herself than trying to foist this manure on innocent readers."
2,stories Tugboat Babs tells the girls,"It is fairly amazing to realize that Barbara Bush is related to three of our four worst presidents -- her husband, her spawn, and the drunk slavery fan Franklin Pierce. You can see elements of all of them in Babs and these agreeably filthy stories with amuse all but the most prudish readers."
3,Descendent of Franklin Pierce??,How could Barbara Bush be a descendent of Franklin Pierce? Didn't all of his children die before reaching childbearing age?
4,Night of the Ninjas,"Night of the NinjasBy Mary Pope OsborneWould you like to hear about a book called Night of the Ninjas? The two main characters are Jack and Annie. They find a Magic Tree House that allows them to travel through time. In this book, they go back to the time of the ninjas. They are captured and taken to the head ninja. I'm not telling what's next. The series is Magic Tree House. This is book number five. Read the book to find out what happens to Jack and Annie.Terry, 7 years oldCunniff SchoolWatertown, MA."
3,Night of the Ninjas,It was very good. I liked it a lot. It would have been better off Jack and Annie became ninjas. Louden (9 years old)
4,Love this series,These books are wonderful. I read them to my child so when my nephew asked for this one I just had to find it. Wonderful read.
5,good for kids,Good for kids my son really enjoyed this and he has since downloaded many of the books of the ser
5,its a great book,"If you like ninjas then you'll want to read night of the ninjas.If you are a fraidy cat you might like Jack and if you like to imagine,then you will like Annie. If you like mice, then you will like Peanut in the story.The story keeps you guessing because the mouse acts like a human.I liked Night of the Ninjas, because it's exciting and you will like it, too."
4,Ninjas!,"If you like ninjas, then this is the book for you, the Night of the Ninjas.If you like mice, you will like the wise mouse Peanut. This is no ordinary mouse. There is a whole bunch of mystery.I like Night of the Ninjas, because it kept me reading."
4,JACK AND ANNIE AND THE NINJAS!,"A spell has been cast on Morgan Le Fay and she needs Jack & Annie to retrieve some items to help her. The Kids must use the Magic Tree house to travel back to ancient Japan to find the clues to the latest mystery. They encounter some Ninja Warriors who turn out to be the good guys and the Ninja Master assists the kids on their quest. But they soon come under attack by a horde of Samurai Warriors, who threaten their mission.This book actually starts a new story arc that will play out over books #5 - 8 in the series and is called the Mystery of the Magic Spell. I like the way Mary Pope Osborne has written these books to be stand alone adventures and yet all four to be part of one 4 book story arc. This one loved at a bit of a slower pace than some of the previous books. There wasn't the chills as their were in Mummies in the Morning, for example. But still a solid effort with excellent illustrations by Sal Murdocha."
4,Cute accessory set,"The ducky slippers fit Baby Born perfectly and the towel too, which has the picture of a duck on it to match. My daughter loves the set and we use it after she bathes her baby. The pink sponge is unnecessary though - I would have rather seen a small rubber duck in the set."
4,Still a bath for casey jr.!!,"Since this toy, is Awesome!!!!!I kep on playing with this toy and when casey jr was taking a bath and i put her the bath clothes!I LOVE BABY BORN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! keeep on the good work!"
5,Great new artist!,"There is a great new voice in town - Valerie de la Cruz. Ms. de la Cruz' new release ""They'll Never Know"" is wonderful listening music from a great new talent. Just listen to the song ""Hey, That's My Kiss"" and you will hear a hit in the making. I heard this song for the first time on my car radio just a week ago, and I'm convinced that we will hear a lot more from Valerie de la Cruz. My wife liked the CD the moment she heard it and I was very happy to find it on Amazon.com.Get this CD. You will be happy you did."
3,Good book but a little long at times,Good read jsut not a page turner...the auhtor does a good job explaining his position.
2,Huram Abi or not Huram Abi (Hiram Abiff???) That is the Question... is it Nobler......,"Mr. Lomas & company takes another crack at the Hiram Matrix, among the trilogy of Hiram books he has written [The Hiram Key] and [The Book of Hiram]being the other two, this one is not as good as ""The Book of Hiram"" however it is much better than the ""Hiram Key"". I guess it comes down to opinion and conjecture with a dash of conspiracy, at best. Maybe Mr. Lomas and company would like to tackle another aspect of Freemasonry, perhaps with better results. Two recommendations on the subject would be ""African Origins of Freemasonry"" (2005) by Zachary Gremillion and ""The Huevolution of Sacred Muur Science Past and Present"" (2005) by Noble Timothy Myers-El"
2,more Lomas claptrap,"Folks, don't spend too much time in fantasy land! While purporting to be an ""insider"", Robert Lomas has alienated himself from most of The Fraternity by breaking his obligation and detailing his experience of initiation. If he's willing to break an obligation like that, just think of the crap he's willing to publish. Fortunately, his is a gross mischaracterization of the experience and ritual varies widely in different regions.The experience of initiation is meant to be very personal and is different for each individual - so it's a disservice for Lomas to give his interpretations to the world in this way. One would walk away with Lomas' view of Freemasonry and not the view of 99.99% of Masons.Suffice it to say, if you're speaking with Masons I wouldn't mention Lomas' name - you might get a weary look and be quickly labelled as an oddball. There are plenty of other good books that are more factual and would be a better use of your time."
2,Run Out of Gas,I loved the others in this series but there is not much new here. Too much of his personel jourmey for me. Read the others twice but skip this one.
2,Not for the current version!,"This booklet -- and it is small -- does not cover the most current software version. It is adequate as a tutorial, though."
5,Excellent!,I loved this movie! This is the story on which most kung fu movies have based their formula on!
5,Awesome Movie,This was a great movie that I enjoyed from beginning to end. I would recommend to any Martial Arts fan who enjoys good fight scenes mixed in with a good story.
5,One of the best karate movies,I have been watching this movies for many times and still want to watch it again. It is in my martial art collections
5,Interesting Movie About The Early Life Of Master Oyama,"This film tells the story of Master Oyama and how he struggled from being an unknown Korean person living under the authoritarian rule of Japan after WWII to becoming a superior martial artist that conquered the Japanese martial ways and established his own Karate style Kyokoshinkai.I have been hearing a lot about Master Oyama before watching this movie. I heard that he was a well established legend that helped create a Karate style that prepares one for real life combat, which is Kyoshinkai. Kyokoshinkai emphases a lot hard techniques and helps one's body accept and also resist pain. Its a rough Karate style however seems to be best in preparing one for street combat.Master Oyama is a legend and his Karate style is great. My respect for Kyokoshinkai Karate has certainly increased after I learned about it and about its developer the Karare Bull Fighter, Master Oyama."
2,Not as good as what others said,"I honestly don't know what other reviewers were watching. I thought the movie was boring and acting was even worse. The characters were coming in and out and storyline was weird (as in jumping around from one point to another: no smooth transition). I actually had to forward many parts and ended up finishing the movie in one hour. I am glad that I did not buy this movie. My recommnedation: rent and if you like it then buy. If I had to choose, then go for ah-ju-cee (A man from nowhere). It was a lot better and I did buy that one."
1,Why must women forever bash men?,"Note to good men: avoid women who would write or read a book entitled ""Why There Are No Good Men Left."""
2,"Women good, men bad","Women in America are so fun to be with, so wonderful, and so full of life, it's sad the men in this country haven't taken notice of them. This book points the finger where it is needed most - at the menfolk!While we do face a 43% divorce rate and a 17% separation rate in this country with 65+% of those divorces and separations initiated by the wives of those marriages, and women are overwhelmingly favored to receive alimony and child support over men in family court, this should be of no concern to men.Oh, and also if you have a woman in your home or are married to her for a short while, you may be liable for a huge amount of palimony or alimony.Oh, and evidentiary due process is not required for you to be convicted of domestic violence in family court. You may end up losing your children, house, bank account and freedom if your wife decides she is bored and wants to ""move on"".Uhhh, never mind...."
1,"No good men left, eh?","Well, how about a little hint.I'm a 23-year-old guy and when I go out to clubs, dances, bars and the like, I'm amazed at how standoffish modern 18-25-year-old girls are. When approached, these little princesses arrogantly dismiss us guys as lame jerks. Instead of being open, positive, and optimistic, many are cynical and b*tchy.If in a few years these princesses start whining about their loneliness, they damn well deserve it!As one wise man said once: ""Most women who are looking for Mr. Perfect are light years from being perfect themselves. Not that you could tell it to them -- or their mothers."""
1,silly book,"First of all, what is a good man? Some women like felons. Some like the tall, handsome, rich men. This book was written for those women who think they are too good for anyone but the top 1% of men out there. I agree, it's hard to get a date with Brad Pitt, George Clooney, or Alex Rodriguez."
4,Expectaions are not equal to reality...,"I rate this book relatively high because it is true from what I've seen. As a divorced 30 somthing male whose salary is approaching six figures, who is ""housebroken"", not in debt, and settled down in life, I can tell you first hand that most guys in my position want nothing to do with the women talked about in this book. They want to train a man in the same manner that they would train a dog, and we are not buying into it. The women represented in this book tend to believe that because they are successful, attactive, and self sufficient there is no reason men shouldn't crawl to them. I fact, men are well aware of these women and avoid them like the plague."
1,What arrogance.,"Here's the subtext:""Where have all the Alpha Males gone?""Answer: by the time professional women have accrued educational and professional success, the men you want (tall, stunning, accomplished, well above median income) have all settled down (and taken mistresses, too, in some cases). In the real world one of the privileges that alpha male status bestows is early round draft picks.As for the rest of the men out there - the nicer but merely mortal guys somewhere in the middle of the bell curve - they're not worthy of someone of your pedigree. Right?"
5,The finest GURPS supplement to date...,"This one has it all... Cyberware, campaign notes, plot hooks and an entire culture between the covers. This book SINGLEY has everything needed for a GURPS Cyberpunk campaign and so much more. It is obvious that the writers and team have a great love for the Genre and it shows through in these pages.Great plot and campaign ideas...*Fantasy Cyberpunk (ala Shadow Run) *Fantasy Punk (with Golem-like body mods where magic replaces tech) *CyberSpace (bringing and edge to the tech in your space campaign) *Super-Punk (New cyber for your supers... OR Supers as a new subset of humanity in your Cyperpunk campaign) *Cyber-Horror (Call of Cthulhu meets Count Zero)All this.. and a Marvelous bibliography (and discography) that will prepare you for any campaign idea."
4,Solid base for a one-off or campaign - maybe could use an update,"It's a useful book, pretty stripped down (as GURPS books seem to be), but there's definitely enough in there to get a good campaign going. (They recommend trying Cyber Punk as a one-off, since the mortality rate can be so high.) The weakness of cyberpunk in general is, being set in the near-future, the ""gee-whiz"" tech of yesterday becomes the everyday stuff of today. It would be nice to make this book a bit more truly ""universal"" - in other words, to build in more flexibility for evolving tech.Other than that, strongly recommended if you're looking to play in this genre."
2,Wow... Just Wow...,"I have two primary complaints:1. No serial killer would be this organized or complicated.2. An emo serial killer is the worst idea I've ever heard.I thought Dennis Quaid's acting was decent throughout and good in a few scenes. There are a few shots that are intriguing, particularly the first scene in the film. Other than that, the plot is like trying to swim through pudding and the ending was one of the least satisfying things I've ever seen.Seriously, skip this one.. it'll only make you mad and give you a headache."
1,Revolting! Don't waste your hard-earned money.,"Other reviewers have rightly noted how poor this film is,especially when compared to SEVEN, which at least offeredhigh quality actors and a decent storyline. But here...why create such disgusting, graphic images of torturedhuman beings? Apparently, there is no limit to the ghastly acts one human can inflict on others, but who wants to see this under the guise of entertainment? Shame on you, Dennis Quaid. I thought you were a betterman than this. Ugh!"
3,Evil grows in broken minds.,"Taken on its own merits this was a good movie. A little less gore than a horror movie. A little more than most thrillers. Evil grows in broken minds, more truth than most people want to believe. Better than most customer reviews. Just watch it and enjoy it,if your not a movie critic you can enjoy it."
1,Lousy...,"Predictable, I figured out who the last horseman was in the middle of the film and the ending itself was so flat.Disappointing.I'm glad I only rented this piece of crap for[...]"
2,Shoot the Horsemen - please!,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Starts well, with the theme of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse2. If only I could say the same of the middle and ending.Dennis Quaid plays a detective who totally neglects his two sons after the death of his wife. He doesn't seem to be doing much better in solving a series of violent murders, with apparent links to the Four Horsemen - War, Famine, Pestilence and Death.The majority of the characters are miscast - Quaid just looks tired and out of his league, while Ziyi Zhang uncharacteristically fails to be anything short of annoying.By the middle of the movie it's fairly obvious what's going to happen, but then at the end it just stops, leaving you hanging with a puzzled expression on your face, and a strong feeling of loss for your last 90 minutes.This is a movie that should have been put out of its misery with a coup de grace in the cutting room.Amanda Richards, May 31, 2009"
2,Dark and Brutal,"This movie was a good detective story, it had a nice ""family"" touch to it, but the murders were brutal and emotionally unsightly. Very little was left to the imagination. Dennis Quaid is one of my personal favorites, and he did a good job, but the story was bloody, brutal and sunk to the lowest levels of depravity. Not my idea of good escapism entertainment."
3,A Decent Thriller,"I can't believe this film has received so many negative reviews!It is a decent thriller that is worth watching. One of the reviews says this movie pales in comparison to ""Seven"". I will agree that ""Seven"" is a better movie but comparing the two movies is like comparing apples to oranges. Dennis Quaid's performance is spot on and more than did justice to his character. I believe the director could have developed the characters better. The pacing of the movie was a bit choppy also. The movie is entertaining and worthy of a 3 star rating. I would recommend renting this movie before buying. It is worth watching at least once."
3,pretty bad,"I gave it three because I really like Dennis Quaid, other than that the movie was bad. If you cant figure out who the last killer is in the first 30 minutes then your bad at these movies almost just as easy as 88 minutes, no suspense."
4,NYsoldier Boy,I never heard of this movie until i went to return one at the redbox. almost every movie was sold out except a few along with horsemen so i rented it and i was suprised at how good it was. the only problem was the ending it could of been better but overall it was a really good movie plus dennis quaid is a really good actor. if not to buy i would atleast rent it but im going to buy it now.
1,Dennis Quaid should never had been part of this movie,"I thought most good mainstream actors would stay away from a movie that has no socially redeeming value whatsoever. I never should have watched the whole movie. Showing scenes where people are tortured to death with blood dripping from their bodies can only be enjoyed by the sickest of people.It really irritates me that I rented it because I thought Quaid was a man wouldn't do trash like this. Aside from the content being obscene the plot is stupid, predictable, and not put together well. The torture scenes deserve an "" X "" rating and it is difficult to get those horrible images out of my head."
1,Sometimes you wish you could give a negative review,"Ok, Dennis Quad is as good as ever. But he can't save this whiny premise for a movie. He is the film in a nutshell: a few whiny nerds who got picked on in school hurt themselves thinking 'I'll show you. You'll be sorry you weren't nice to me'. So you weren't the high school quarterback or prom queen. Get over it. Noone cares if you want to be a moron and hurt yourself. What makes the film really unwatchable though is that they trid to make an epic about these whiny little nerds. Honestly, I wanted to shoot them myself just to make them stop whining!"
1,What the???,"I had never heard of this movie when my wife bought it for movie night. What a senseless downer of a film. I actually generally like Dennis Quaid quite a bit, but nothing and no one could have saved this twisted story.Don't waste your movie time on this one unless you just like to see what kind of wierd torture a director could come up with... and for the message that parents who don't spend enough time with their kids (because they work or are having emotional issues of their own) will turn them into serial killers.Huh?"
1,"Take your average episode of ""criminal minds""","Extract the creativity, cast chemistry, all of the suspense, most of the good acting (fact is, the kid in this to his credit, made much more of bad material than it in any way deserved), double the running time and add a particularly lame ending? And you've got an idea of a better film than this one was."
1,Can I give less than one star?,"Very disappointed in this DVD. I did not notice that the run time was only eight minutes (my fault). Not being anywhere near a full version there really is not much here at all. The text of the original play is almost non existent. Moreover, the acting, makeup and production has the feel of a high school project. If you are interested in Euripides don't bother with this. If you are interested in amateur theatricals I suggest finding some kind of DVD collection or best of. This is simply not worth the money!"
4,Excellent kit for the money,"I used this kit on my American Racing polished aluminum wheels and they work great. I would have liked to have had a thinner cone to get in the the real tight corners but I can't complain. I would say the quality is a tad below what I could get at Eastwood but then again, I'm not paying Eastwood's prices. In my experience, they do load up with debris more so than my other buffers (Eastwood), even though I dressed them pretty regularly. My solution was to slow down the drill and keep dressing them.Worked great and good selection of shapes."
2,Marginally functional but better than nothing,"These polishing tools are great, if you get a good one. Out of the whole armload of these, only 3 would actually work without spinning on the shaft. I tried tightening them, but there didn't seem to be any more threads to tighten them on the shafts. The result was that the shaft would turn but the buffing wheel would not. Finally I bought one made by Astro and it was great."
4,Great Value!,After using several different products on my aluminum rims I've found this product to work very well. And for the price it's a great buy.
3,"Good Product, Unfortunate Recent Price Hike","This product was great at $19.99. Went to order another set to find out that the price has now been raised to $25. Mothers sells a nice buffer ball attachment for $19.99. Granted it's only one, but it last longer and can be reused. These buffing pads are pretty much a one time use... If they bring their price back down to $19.99, I'll change my rating from 3 to 5 stars."
2,One time use,These are good for one use only.If you try to wash them they fall apart.Don't know what else to say
3,cheap....,Im not to happy with these. They fell apart real quick and really didn't do any better than doing it by hand. The material.was flyingbof in pieces as soon as I began using them. I ended up returning them because of this fact. I really don't recommend using these. You would be better off doing it by hand and also getting better results by doing so.
4,ALMOST EXCELLENT!!!,"What bothers me is that this could have been final show. Its perfect in sense that kramdens n nortons move out. This is best show honeymooners ever made. Intelectual reaction between ralph n norton is pure genius, mickey mouse act rules,perfect timin!"
4,He's still got it!,"With so many played out, old, recycled, lo-fi dub compilation albums being released on small time independent labels, it is great to see that Scientist is still around, creating wicked NEW dub versions. This album shows why Scientist is one of reggae music's most revered producers. On ""Scientist Dubs Culture..."", Scientist teams up with another legendary reggae artist, Culture, but does not strip the tracks down to the point that the original song is unrecognizable. This album is as much ""Culture"" as it is ""Scientist"",and is true to form. Scientist's mixing is superb and effects laden while Culture is as dread as ever. ""SDCIPU"" is truly an album for dub/roots fans; Reminiscent of the early 80's, but with a clarity and sound quality for the 00's."
5,This is the best and most concise intro to Sartre.,"""Search for a Method"" was originally intended as a postcript to the 1960 ""Critique of Dialectical Reason,"" but it became the intro & then was published separately. Its thesis, ""Cultural order is irreducible to natural order,"" forms the basis for an examination of contemporary Marxism, which Sartre calls ""arrested."" Between ""Being and Nothingness"" and the often puzzling posthumous material, this is the best and most concise intro to Sartre by Sartre. Kudos to Professor Barnes for another outstanding translation!"
5,wonderfully evinced,"Professor Barnes easily makes clear Satre's works even through his haze of Extentialism. As Sartre gave us his posture of dialectical materialism, Professor Barnes clearly explains Sartre. Thank you Professor Barnes, and, do it again and again, please."
3,Skip Part One,"First of all, potential readers should know that this is not a novel about modern day tattoos, but about a woman that fancies herself an artist. The first part is about this woman, Sara and her life as a struggling artist in New York in the 1920's going on 30's. Her and her lover Phillip bored me to tears. In all fairness, I am not an artist, so perhaps fabricating art out of people's old gold teeth may appeal to others. It just did not appeal to me. Part two is interesting. It introduces the island and the Ta'un'uu people and their tattoo culture and history. I enjoyed part two and had most of the novel been about the Ta'un'uu and not about the shallow Sara and Phillip, I would have enjoyed the novel itself a lot more. Part three is Sara's ""rescue"" and her sudden introduction back into mainstream society. Is it really the best thing for her?"
3,"Interesting, but creepy","I agree with the previous poster that the story lacked depth. The premise of what is home, New York, the South Pacific, jewish heritage, etc, is facinating. However, these facets of the story were discussed very superfically. Also, the idea of tattooing an entire body, including the face and tongue was just too creepy for me, although I am sure for others it was not a problem. I understand that the tattooing was part of the premise of discovering who and what we are, but it was too distracting for me. Also, I would have liked to learn more about the Tan'un'uu characters, they were more interesting to me than Sarah, the central character."
4,Mesmerising!,"This book was chosen for my book club, and I am so glad I read this, as otherwise I may not have known about this beautiful work of art. This was such a different story, and one I was totally drawn into. It teeters between the old world and new world. I strongly recommend it."
2,"Not great, and then it broke.","I had the controller for 4 months. The X button (gas pedal in driving games) took excessive force, like others reviews have noted. My thumb fell asleep in 15 minutes. After 4 months, it start acting erratic. Soon after that, it started firing an up and down input from the d-pad almost continuously. I could not find a fix."
1,Do not buy or look at!,"I have to 100% agree! I absolutely hate this thing! When i first got it, i plugged it in and it didnt even work. Brand new and it didnt work!! bs!! At first i thought is was the ps2, then i found out is was the controller itself. So i messed with it and got it to work....until it started bugging out! It is sortof playable but if you dont mind the bugging,uncomfertableness,hard to push buttons,and the lag then yeah this is right for you...... just kidding it sucks."
3,NO COMPRAR!!!,"NO RECOMIENDO ESTE CONTROL, INICIALMENTE NUNCA SE PUDIERON CARGAR LAS PILAS, SIEMPRE TENGO QUE USARLO CON EL CABLE. NUNCA PUEDO USARLO DE FORMA INALAMBRICA"
3,challenging assembly,"The Camario car kit has some challenges in assembly.1. The hood for the engine does not close completely. I had to glue the lid shut.2. The windows slids from the front to the back. The diagram demostrates the installation, but it is not intuitive. The window may need to be filed down so that the dash around it will fit.3. The headlights have plastic molding excess remains that need removed.4. The hoses to the radiator are impossible to connect5. The rear exhaust pipes need to fit over the bumper and not under. The assembly sequence will have you install the exhaust pipes before the rear bumper6. I couldn't find the side mirrors. The model shows two red side mirrors.This model is rate as a level 2 assembly, but considering the number of challenges I would rate it more difficult.I used red modeling paint. The kit does look good after painting and apply decals."
4,Great sound,This group has a great sound....their music is wonderfully strong and great to listen to. The lead singer has a distinct voice to be remembered. I highly recommend them!
4,Pure Pop Pleasure,"Fronted by Sara Weaver on rhythm guitar and lead vocals with Brett Acker on bass and Tracy Bannett on drums, Swisher is a Philadelphia-based trio that mines a vein of pure pop pleasure. Reminiscent at times of early Blondie or Ramones, Swisher serves up 3 minutes pop confections made up of equal parts punk sensibility, girl group harmonies and ultra catchy melodies. Sara Weaver, who has attitude to burn, delivers a series of acidic vignettes, directed mostly at relationships gone sour.Though a little rough around the edges, this self-produced debut is chock full of little gems. Just after getting this album I played it for a friend of mine who normally does not listen to music of this ilk. As we were leaving his place to catch a cab, I caught him humming ""Faceache""All that, Farfisa organ, and a cover of Ozzy too! What more can you ask? Swisher is clever, witty, and fun!"
1,Worthless,I had to get this book for a graduate class I was taking. What a waste. It is a commercial for all the other docs and videos Harlene sells on her web site. Absolutely nothing is free. You must pay for everything to extend the learning from this book.
2,Not Recommended For Beginners,"The book doesn't take the time to explain anything; its just straight forward, ""here's the words, memorize them and complete the exercises."" I found it very difficult to learn anything from this book."
5,This gun owns!!!!!,This gun owns and for 100 dollars it is quite a steal. It is extremely powerful truely does shoot 320 fps with .2 gram bb's. Not only does it shoot 320 fps it also shoots with pin point accruracy. Another thing that is great about this gun is it is all metal I can not find a plastic piece on this gun. Also this gun has a metal gear box so it will last forever and it won't break when you drop it. That guy who put a 1 star review is a retard and don't pay attention to him. I bet he didn't even buy the gun. Anyhow if you are done putting money into guns you think are good but actually are not then put a little more money into this gun and it will probably be the last one you buy.GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!!
2,This gun is NOT an ICS it is a Cyma,"I purchased this gun expecting an ICS, which have an excellent reputation and power. This is NOT an ICS, it is a Cyma CM.028-B which is vastly inferior to the ICS AK-47 offerings.The seller advertised: ""This AEG shot an unbelievable 360 fps and 490 fps with 0.12g BBs."" However, the information on the box says 85mps (meters) which is 280 fps, confirmed that it seems to exhibit power in the 280 fps range. This is nowhere near the 360 fps advertised.[...]The gun is also not terribly solid, I can easily rotate the front site 5 degrees in either direction which renders it effectively useless. [...]"
2,Wrong Gun.,"I ordered this gun because it was the cheapest price I could find an ICS AEG anywhere. However, when I recieved the item it turned out to be an AK47 manufactured by the Chinese company CYMA, whose products are not of the same quality as ICS. I returned the product for a refund because CYMA AK47's are available at a cheaper price elsewhere."
2,"Puts me to sleep, with its trite boredom.","I hate to jump on the ""let's bash Shadowkeep"" bandwagon, but this release really let me down. It is the case of a label signing too many bands, even when bands like this are NOT ready to be signed. I think they could've released this as their FIRST demo, not their debut album and gotten away with it. Back to the drawing board for these guys."
1,I want to puke,"This makes me want to throw up, quite literally. These women do not represent the Catholic Church no matter what they say. This is a total perversion of the Gospel. Jesus didn't say women and men wil have equal roles. This is totally disturbing and backwards."
4,Cherigirl,"great fit. I found some other cords in Costco some months back.Loved the fit, so started looking for more OP clothing.Alas, nothing local. So off to my nearest internet connectionand I was able to purchase more of an item I already own."
3,It's OK,This video is OK. I was disappointed that Johnny sang only 1 or 2 songs. The rest were others singing their songs.
2,Indeed false advertising,"It's probably a good concert for those interested in country music altogether but it definitely shouldn't be sold as a Johnny Cash concert as you only get 6 songs from him. The 2 best being ""My name is Sue"" and ""Sunday Morning Comin' Down"" you'd better get the ""Anthology"" instead where you get 15 full songs."
3,3 stars only because I couldnt bear to give Johnny Cash less,"Unless you simply must SEE Linda Ronstadt etc, and can tolerate some other performers' irritating attempts at humor, Cash's renditions of any of the songs he does on this issue are inferior to what he did with them, and many other wonderful songs, on the 4-CD ""Cash: The Legend"" and the 3-CD: ""Johnny Cash: The Complete Sun Recordings 1955-1958"". And as for SEEING the young Johnny Cash, a much more moving and enjoyable experience would be the DVD ""Johnny Cash at Town Hall Party"". Its technical imperfections, because it was made from old TV films, are noticeable, but if you love Johnny Cash you'll forgive him the DVD's imperfections, as you forgive him his own imperfections."
4,The Man in Black,"I bought this DVD as I love Johnny Cash's music and story telling.The DVD is both enjoyable and disappointing. His version of ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" to me is worth buying this DVD alone. Ronstadt and Roy Clark are bonus's but really there should be a whole lot more of John.Still, I have no complaints"
3,short on Cash,"This DVD is for hard core Cash lovers like myself. Just be warned that, of the 14 songs on this recording, only 6 are sung by Cash,with microphone in hand, no guitar. And to think I had forgotten all about the fake drunk acts of the period. (A reference to some of the filler material that has nothing to do with Cash.) Pathetic. Whether flying or walking, Cash brings home the goods, but this DVD is for collectors only, a sad ripoff which capitalizes on the Man in Black when he's beyond reach."
1,Bad product,I was greatly disappointed in this video. The tape rolled continuously and the audio was 'tinny.' I am unable to return it because of the return policy prohibits returning open videos. I certainly will not sell it to someone else. I wasted $15.00 on this tape!
2,False Advertising,"If you're hoping for a video of 'at Folsom Prison' or 'at San Quentin' this isn't it. It's billed as a Johnny Cash concert with special guests, but it's really more of a variety show bookended by Johnny. Johnny appears on less then half this DVD. The stuff that's there is great, but it really just wets your appetite and leaves you wanting more."
4,Both witty and absurd.,"It should be known that this book is more appealing to those with at least a moderate interest in contemporary American history. In other words, it's for ""Jeopardy"" fans, not ""Millionaire"" fans.This book doesn't just lampoon American, it rips it apart and spits it back at you, all the while leaving smiling and shaking your head. The writers leave no item from the past 100 years untouched -- it's remarkably broad and thorough.After 40-50 years, the actual columns under the precious headlines (which are really the point of the book) get a bit formulaic, and I found my self skimming some of them. However, I cannot think a humor book that has more 'meat' in, making it well worth the price."
5,OMG is this funny,"When I first discovered The Onion two years ago, I literally woke up with sore abdominal muscles. Not from too many situps, from laughing out loud so hard at the most finely tuned news satire to come along in decades. ""Our Dumb Century"" features the Onion's classic satire newspapers for highlighted dates throughout the 20th century. Headlines include (October 29, 1919) ""Teddy Roosevelt Allows Three Others to be Carved into Mountain,"" (November 21, 1943) ""Loose Lips Sink Ship,"" and (January 21, 1993) ""New President Feels Nation's Pain, Breasts."" (The same date has ""Tipper Gore Jerks Arrhythmically at Inagural Ball."") And that's just the headlines. The articles take the concepts and run. Not always even, not always hilarious, but there's something worth laughing out loud at on every page.If you like to laugh, read The Onion."
2,"Love the book, hate the uniform","The delivery man brought the book to my house. Sadly, the uniform he wore was an atrocity of all things fashionable. The people at the book shop wear nicer clothes most of the time."
3,Too much missing,"As an avid Onion reader during my undergrad years at UW-Madison, I have become fond of the Onion's sarcastic humor. Unfortunately, ""Our Dumb Century"" leaves many funny aspects of the Onion out. There were many incredibly funny ""Ask a..."" advice columns that should have been reprinted. Also, the ""What do you think"" question and answer box was always my favorite part of the paper. Don't get me wrong, the book ""Our Dumb Century"" is hilarious. However, I don't feel like I was getting the whole ""Onion experience"" by simply reading the cover pages."
3,"uhhhh,","you're all missing the point. The Onion is amazing; funny, smart, the whole nine yards. But brilliant political satire? spare me. The Onion, and Our Dumb Century in particular, pokes fun at things like homophobia, racism, and sexism, by BEING homophobic, racist, and sexist. OK, it's the best thing out there, but genius? I disagree."
2,I can only weep...,"Sure, it was funny. But as I pondered its constuction, I asked myself, ""What of the trees used to print these words of questionable irony? Hmmm? What of the tall Pine and Maple that gave to bravely of their life-essence that poison-based inks might reproduce the tome?"" At this point the bookstore warehouse guard came and threw me out into the cold night, as the book had yet to be officially released, but not before I got a couple kicks in. But still, the thought of the trees still haunts.."
1,Just plain stupid,"This stuff is really juvenile. Not necessarily because it's rude or offensive (although it is that, too), but just plain dumb. Damn smug about it to boot. I probably would have thought this was the greatest book in the world if I'd read it in high school."
5,Lives up to The Onion's reputation,"I've been a fan of The Onion for about 10 years since my brother brought the comedic coupon paper home from college at Madison, WI. This book delivers The Onion's wit over the whole century! Some hate The Onion's brand of humor but I love it. If you like The Onion's web page or the paper, you'll love this book. I only wish all the great stories The Onion had over the past decade were represented in this book!"
5,A piognant look back on the century that was,"When it comes to looking at the past century, no one can provide a closer look than writers of the Onion. When reflecting on the twentieth century, the Onion's staff correctly points out that the only word to describe it, is ""dumb."" A masterpiece"
5,It must be banned! America is not ready for it.,"The Onion lives up to its name. I laughed so hard, I cried! Puts history in a new light. Humorous, irreverant, point blank, and even educational. What more can you ask for?"
5,"Meant for those with a thick skin, not a thick skull","Visiting the sicker half of my family in British Columbia, I came across ""The Onion"" sitting on my aunt and uncle's coffee table. Unsuspectingly, I picked it up, assuming it to be one of those humdrum local papers....The further I read, the more I laughed. My cousin caught me with his paper in hand, and came back the next day to torture me some more with the ""our dumb century"". By supper time, we all stood around the book, letting the food burn, howling, pointing out various sick, satirical headlines. Definately not for the faint of heart, but if you've got a thick skin, a balanced sense of how the universe truly operates, and can crack a smile now and again when someone flies in the face of the insipid ""PC"" movement, this is for you."
5,Bombarded by humorous produce!,"THE ONION has been my primary source for news for going on ten years, and this book will keep me from ever having to touch newsprint again! Halleluia"
5,Sharp-minded Hysterics,"Sharp-minded Hysterics""Our Dumb Century"" is 100 years of the New York Times-esq newspaper doing April Fools editions. The effect is brilliant. I think the farther back they went in history, the funnier the effect. Stories like ""Japan Forms Alliance with White Supremacists in Well-Thought-Out Scheme,"" ""India's Nationalist Leader Pummeled Senseless By Practitioners of British 'Violence' Movement,"" and ""Cubist Regiment Decimated,"" are just but a few of the Onion's take on history.I've don't think I've read anything as utterly hilarious. Enjoy!"
4,Funny satire based on historical half-truths,"The satire is first rate, but it seems to be applied in a way that exagerates the common stereo-types and half-baked perceptions about American history. The Reagan bashing, red-scare exageration, Black Panther sympathizing, anti-military tones and ""Eat the Rich"" mentality is very consistent with any newspaper coming out of Madison, Wisconsin. The real weekly Onion, however, is more balanced than this book tends to be. Still, a very original and funny work."
2,Foreigners beware!,"If you didn't grow up in the USA, You won't get the gist of most of it. I always prided myself on my knowledge of American history, but most of the contents of this book passed me by and what I did recognize was not nearly as witty as the descrition of this book made me believe. GD"
2,really small!,"Oops, didn't realize I was ordering a mini book. A bit of a surprise when I opened the box! I think I'll stick with bigger books from now on. Some funny stories, but the web site is way more fun."
5,Funniest book I have ever read,"""Our Dumb Century"" is hands down, without a doubt, the funniest book I have ever read. Nobody and nothing is safe from these ribald, brilliantly satirical ""articles"". This ism't a book of cheap shots though...well it is, but they are really intelligent cheap shots and the thoroughness with which the 20th century is reviewed is worthy of a history book. Words can't do this book justice, suffice it to say, if you want something that will make you laugh so hard tears are running down your face, this is it."
5,Way to go Onion,"If you are an Onion fan and you've been wary of buying what you can get for free - I have to tell you that you must be really .... Why not drop ten bucks for a book that has all new Onion stories to enjoy? Now, this isn't one of those stupid books that merely reprints old comic strips ... or stuff that you've seen and then you get home and feel .... No way, this is a book of all new Onion stories - the Onion from 1900 to the present (1 paper per year) with all of the sick and fun parody that the folks at the Onion are known for. ..., this book will help tide you over until the next issue is up online - and you won't feel burned in the process."
4,Need to know some history,It sounds so incredibly good that you don't know sometimes if what they are saying is true or false. You really need a strong background in the subject on some of the information to get it.
4,Sacred cows make the best hamburger...,"...especially when eaten with onions. :) Amazing little book, this; some of the headlines alone had my sides threatening to split. One of the most hilarious publications in recent memory; this is the book that Mad and its ilk want to be when they grow up. ;)"
5,Best source of humor I know,"Our Dumb Century is an incredible mix of history, humor, satire, and shock value. A fun book to pick up whenever you have a spare moment. If you ever watch the History Channel and have a slightly sick sense of humor, then this book will be perfect for you. When you read it, I almost feels like you are learning while you laugh uncontrollably."
5,The funniest book I've ever read!,"This was truly the funnniest book I have ever read. My favorite headline was the screaming expletives detailing the moonwalk. While this book will probably be scorned by some, and offend others, it is hilarious, as long as the reader does not have a misconceptions of what men like JFK and FDR were truly like."
5,Why am I not this funny?,"I've been running my own humor mag for a year now, and I must say, The Onion is ten times funnier than we are! Oh, the agony of being able to appreciate how damn hilarious they are without being able to reach it in The Shrubbery! Ak! So yeah, buy it."
5,The most laughs that $9 can buy,"I'm another reader from way back (1993), who has split his sides for years on the razor-sharp wit of the weekly issues. This book has already reduced me to tears several times, and left countless friends gasping for breath.What makes The Onion breathtaking is its willingness to puncture the simpleminded pieties of our status quo. No one anywhere on the political, economic or cultural spectrum is safe. NATO and PETA, Angelou and Gates, advertisers and hippies, cops and crackheads, Christians and Muslims, teens and retirees... all are fair game.But what makes it revolutionary is that in picking apart our national life, it lays bare just how conservative, close-minded, bigoted, and selfish our culture, politics, and national mythologies are. In a way that perhaps only parodies can, The Onion brings a brutal honesty to this review of the 20th century -- both more entertaining and illuminating than any that Peter Jennings, Time-Life or CNN will churn out."
1,Not funny,"Beware the dolts and louts who find such ""humor"" funny. Too bad, too. I was really ready for a good laugh."
1,#20 is Dumb & Dumber,"The Onion will be a fine resource for film producers known for ""vacation"" sequels, which their sub-marginal reviewers in the a.v. section will appreciate. The audio version will be useful to the late 40's trying to keep up with MTV advertising banners at the website. The #20 bestseller just could turn out to be the DUMBEST thing this century."
2,Teeny tiny version of this book!!,"Ok, so I guess I'm kind of an idiot for not looking more closely when I ordered this for my kid for Christmas. It's literally 3"" by 2"". Yes, that's right.... Not sure what the purpose is, other than I guess it's easier to carry around. My kid didn't seem to mind, though, and it gets a star because it's the Onion, and it is funny. But I'd have preferred the regular-sized version."
5,Should be used to supplement school history texts,"This book serves as the coffin lid to the 20th Century with stabbing comentary and satire on human pretentions, war, ignorance, near-sightedness, and general stupdity. The Onion's characteristicly dry wit gives the reader a fresh outside perspective on the highlights of history's most eventful 100 years."
5,Funniest book I have EVER found!,Funny yet darkly sarcastic. This book is not for the timid at heart but if you have been looking for something twisted and highly humorous pull out that credit card immediately. So darn funny we bought 5 of them as Christmas presents to our friends and relatives.Issues for some readers: Some language; mild and some not so mild. Deeply sarcastic toward the subject. VERY DARK HUMOR!Positives: Funniest thing out there!
5,True to its format,"A while ago, I heard of theonion.com, I read a couple of their articles and I was simply overwhelmed with laughter, to the point of tears. There is no other word to describe this book but ""genius"". If you like political satire in any way, this is a sure buy. However, there is some offensive language and racist statements, however since no one is left sacred (except us Canadians) this makes it ok, it is indiscriment discrimination. It is a great book."
4,Highly Amusing for a Light Chuckle,"'The Onion' has brought together its own special blend of humour in this book -- and if you're a fan of that comic styling (and admittedly, not everyone is), you'll find yourself rolling from this one.Keeping with 'The Onion's tradition of blatantly mocking all aspects of modern culture, ""Our Dumb Century"" is a special treat in that it presents a 'historical work'; a look back at all the 'headlines' from the past 100 years. Fans will love the jabs at 1908 maladies and 1920's anxieties.The humour is of its own brand, but if that brand is yours (i.e., you've read the Onion before, and enjoyed it), then this is a book you'll love."
5,A great way to start the day,"I think that this is one of the best ways to start the day. When I get to work, I peel back yesterdays news and laugh at the absurdity of today's. A great pick me up."
5,Give those men two dollars!,"Since its 1994 inception as the humor section of the AV Club Weekly Entertainment Magazine, the Onion has consistently dished up some of the deepest, most brilliant true satire anywhere. Our Dumb Century will leave readers wondering ""Where do these guys get their ideas?"" The amount of bile, inspired bitterness, and just plain hatred on these dense, beautifully designed pages is heartwarming. The Onion writers all deserve to get rich off this masterwork, or at least have office manager Andrew buy them a new halogen lamp and dry-erase board."
4,Fun Game. Best in Co-Op Mode,"I bought this game when my girlfriend was visiting, because I heard that it had a great co-op mode and was pretty easy for all ages and gamer experience levels (she is not a gamer at all). What I heard was true on all accounts. We played the entire game in split screen co-op mode and had a blast. It makes doing all of the tasks a lot easier and allows both characters to basically free roam the entire level.My only complaint is that it is a short game, since we beat it together in about 9-10 hours.If you are simpsons fan and are looking for a good 2 player co-op game, then I would suggest getting this."
2,"If you have to play it, do it on another sytem than the Wii","I picked up The Simpsons off an Amazon Goldbox deal for $25, hoping that it would live up to my expectations. While the comedy put into it by the writers and cast is superb, the game itself is another matter. Remember how graphics looked back in the late 90's? When 3D was still relatively new but anti-aliasing hadn't taken off yet? That's where this game dates visually. The ""jaggies"" are EVERYWHERE (again, this applies to the Wii version).If you have to play a platformer on the Wii, do yourself a favor and pickup either Super Mario Galaxy or Lego Star Wars. You can thank me later. ;)"
1,Children were disappointed on Christmas morning,We have not had the opportunity to play this game as I live in Australia and it is not compatible with my Wii console
3,"Good, but could be better","""The Simpsons"" for the Wii is, in general, a good game. Clever plots, nice animation and great voice work. Unfortunately, controlling the players is a lot harder than it needs to be. It seems as if absolutely perfect coordination and timing, plus a little bit of luck and being in exactly the right place at the right time, is necessary to be able to advance further in the game. Practice certainly makes perfect, but it does get frustrating when you're just half a second off and all your work ends up being ruined."
5,the simpsons game/ wii,Fun game to play just like the show. Great game to play for hours an hours of fun. Just have to stop a eat lunch some times Ha! Ha!
2,Simpsons - Old School,"Unfortunately I thought this would be a fun simpsons game. However, little did I realize that I already had this for the playstation 2 from years ago! The graphics are horrible and the characters are difficult to control."
2,Fun for about 30 minutes. Then frustrating and annoying.,"I'm sure hard-core Simpsons fans would enjoy this game but it gets tedious and repetitive. The controls are hard to get used to and I wanted to turn it off after the first 30 minutes. Rent it, don't buy."
2,Ouch my eyes,If you are buying or playing this game you had better LOVE the Simpsons in general. The game play is rough at best with th ecamera shifting all around. The animated sceens look spectacular however once game play starts the visuals decline big time. It's the same run around and punch with Homer for 2 levels and that's when I just quit. I couldn't waste anymore time on a game that was this unappealing. We tried the 2 player split screen but that just enhanced the short-comings of the camera. I would not recommend. The lone bright spot was the funny one-liners that homer and family spits out randomly.
2,Should have been so much better...,"I rented this game. I'm so glad I didn't buy it. The camera never seems to be where you want it to be. The ""hidden packages"" are supremely pointless. The super powers vary from underwhelming to annoying. (Marge's bullhorn is one of the most irritating things I've ever heard.) The cut scenes are entertaining.I stopped playing in the middle of a level, because the game just isn't held together well. And I'm returning it with no intention of ever playing it agin or recommending it to anyone. Parts of it are okay, but it's just not worth it."
5,my spacecoaster rocks my face off,"this band is great. i highly recommend checking them out. and while you're at it, check out the bands they are touring with at the moment, ""getaway driver"" and ""salty earth,"" both local lawrence bands. (thats where the best bands in the world come from...ie: the anniversary and the get up kids) this is not a band to pass up."
3,Apocalypse Zero - Battle 1,"Im a fan of anime but mildly enjoy this title. I did not enjoy the style of animation used in this title, and the amount of gore in this is tremendous. The story line however is intriguing, set in a post apocalyptic world. That is one element that would make one look past the animation style and gore. So if you enjoy a lot of blood and guts and monster slaying, get this title."
4,Heavy Feel but effective,What can you say about a Hammer that is a bit heavy but effective to get the job done. at a price that it is reasonable.... a goood value? that's it!
1,Disappointment,"I bought the When I Was Made cd based on other Amazon purchases I had made. Well, I found Edie Carie's lyrics and delivery to be a sad disappointment."
4,A CHARMING STORY WITH LESSONS TO BE LEARNED,"Enhanced with subtle rich oil paintings, ""Amber on the Mountain"" is the story of a girl who wants to learn. Amber is a mountain girl who has no one to teach her.And then, Anna arrives - a girl her own age whose father is going to build a new road. Although Anna has to leave the mountain before she can teach Amber everything she wishes, Amber perseveres in her quest to learn.This charming story teaches the value of education, friendship, and the importance of working for what you want."
4,Wonderful!,"This book was wonderful. If you have never seen paintings by Robert Duncan, you have to buy this. His illustrations are incredible."
2,"Average Read, But For Age Limited Audience","Probably best for 6-8 yrs. I read this story to my 4 and 6 year-olds. My 4 year old was quickly bored, because the story dwells on a topic that is not interesting for young story listeners--learning to read. My 6 year old was mildly interested, but there are too many books that she'd rather have read to her. The illustrations are as good as you'll see for a childrens book, but that alone can't salvage a dull story, that only a select age group will pay attention to."
3,Medical Clerical Student,"I am currently a student in the medical field, and the medical field is filled with tons of abbreviations and I have to know what they all are when I transcribe them. This book really helps me find them much faster than having to find them on the internet. Many of my school books have a portion of the abbrevations and Eponyms but having them in one book is easier and faster then going to one book to another."
5,A Must Have Book,"This book is a very essential book for anyone who is planing to work in the medical field as a Medical Transcriptionist., or even for anyone studing to becopme a Medical Assistant.It gives 99.5% of all approved medical abbreviations as well as many eponyms used in the medical field.Fran,Flint, Mi"
3,Great Ideas-Story Arc Needs Work,"As some have already stated below, the scope and detail of the science of this book is truly astounding. As a cosmology buff, this was a great read concerning cosmic strings, star formation and life, quantum physics, etc. Unfotunately, there isn't a large amount of narrative or character development to pull this stuff along. The characters seem to be there solely to explain to each other what is happening and the science behind it. Often, you can't tell who is speaking and frankly don't care becuase it is pure exposition. None of the characters are particularly well developed beyond archetypes (mad scientist, aborigne rube). I don't want to give the impression that I didn't enjoy it though. I just wish there was a better mesh of the hard-sf with character and plot development. Maybe those are fundamentally incompatible."
3,"Love Baxter, but this book needed work","I loved Baxter's other novels, but this one just didn't do it. It was not as imaginative as his others, and most of all the writing was bland and much of the plot tedious and boring. The plot and setting had potential, but I think he should have spent more time working on it before delivering what I read."
1,Way too hardcore,Way too hardcore scifi. Frank Herberts Dune chronicles is much better if you liked the sound of this storyline.
1,a poor attempt at hard sci-fi,"A truly horrible book. It claims to be ""very, very hard SF"", but almost all important features of the plot are completely implausible. A lot of buzzwords are thrown around, and basic understanding of certain principles is demonstrated, but real understanding of the fundamentals is completely lacking. The characters are completely flat and have no depth or complexity. The dialogue is easy to read, but not realistic at all. Most aspects of the book simply didn't make sense. I'm still not sure why I forced myself to read the whole thing."
1,"Science = acceptable, Story = pain","Combining science and fiction well is a rare talent. Steven Baxter lacks this talent, and the result is horrific. I have (stupidly) read both 'Ring' and 'Titan' and despised both of them. The characters are useless scenery for science material ............. directly from an undergraduate astronomy textbook."
5,Hard SF on the grand scale,"Hard SF the way it can and should be written. Baxter creates well-drawn and interesting characters and sets them loose on an adventure of truly mind-boggling scale. I haven't read any of his stuff before, but that's gonna change, now! ""Ring"" reminds me most of Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Red Mars,"" which won a well-deserved Hugo Award. It's positively bursting with well-thought-out and captivating speculation and extrapolation, and most of the time I was reading, I just kept shaking my head in amazement at the scope of the ideas. You may learn more about stellar physics or superstring theory than you'd like to, but hey, that's hard SF, and Baxter does a good job of keeping the science understandable. ""Ring"" occasionally drags a bit, but not for long, and I guarantee it will expand your mental horizons."
2,"A physics lecture, not a story","Lots of ideas. Lots of physics. No believable characters or plot, unfortunately. Maybe Baxter would do better writing nonfiction."
3,"Knock out ideas, shame about the story","The main reason for reading this is to go ""Wow"" at Baxter's ideas. The scope of his imagination is just incredible. And its all justified by Baxter's detailed knowledge of Physics. However some of the time I felt he was showing off how much he knew about Physics and it felt like the characters were lecturing to you. The plot drags in several places (especially in the long journeys in the Xeelee nightfighter), and characters are 2 dimensional at best. I would describe this book as the Terminator 2 of Sci Fi books. The best latest big budget ideas and special effects but strip them away and there is next to nothing left."
2,Meandering through the World of Big Physics Ideas,"Ring is about a group of diverse, but sketchily drawn, characters who take a big trip, visiting giant superstings and other big physics stuff on the way. The universe is in danger, and our heros plan to watch the fireworks. Or something like that -- the motivations, and even the goals of the characters really aren't too clear.It's pretty awful, but I'll give it more than one star since I was sort of curious about what they would find when they got to the big battleground, though not so curious that I was able to slog though the entire book."
3,Ring Review,"Classic Stephen Baxter, definitely not his best work, but makes for some good entertainment, has a younger reader feel to it."
4,Large time scales in an epic story,"I've read a number of reviews of this book speaking to Mr. Baxter's lack of character development and I must come to his defense. His books are not character centered in a traditional sense. Where he forgoes chasing a character's personal development with some clichéd epiphany or self realization somewhere mid-text; he chooses to focus on the science over the fiction. This is the essence of what is called ""hard sci fi"". The book covers millions of years and humanity itself becomes the character. It's a fun book with an ambitious timeline and my only wish was that it could have focused more on either the perspective of humanity or science. Occasionally it did seem to lack focus but the overall story makes for a fascinating read."
1,"If you're a dummy, get this!","If you know anything about writing some HTML, and setting up a site, you know more than this book has to offer. Very vague, very outdated, and really all fluff. Save your money."
2,Ok for beginners,"This book is exactly for what its title suggests, ""Dummies"", really no depth at all, but if you are a beginner that really has no idea what is going on in all aspects of web design or webmastering, then I suggest you get it to get an idea of what is going on. Even after that however you will probably still need another beginner level book to help get you up to speed on some other more in depth issues that webmasters face."

3,I Like What You're doing To Me,This is a very dificult song to found. Is an expression of how must be a song full of rithem
3,An ok read,"Genie Watkins is a young girl coming of age in Birmingham when the war breaks out. With her bother heading the country and her father going to France, Genie is left to deal with her family. A mother stepping out and having another man's baby and a uncle who is challanged. But while the bombs are dropping Genie finds herself falling in love with son of her boss. But in wartime and each raid lives can change quickly.""Birmingham Blitz"" by Annie Murray was an okay book. While I enjoyed it I have confess that after a while with so many characters I began to lose interest and I had to force myself to finish it. Overall ""Birmingham Blitz"" was a decent book but it really didn't hold my interest."
3,ehh,"At Worlds End isn't really that bad, I have enjoyed it for the few hours I played it, but it gets hard pretty soon. Not hard like boss battles hard, but hard like you have no idea of what to do next. It has decent graphics, but nothing spectacular. I havnt tried the multiplayer yet, but its pretty cool you only need 1 game cartridge for multiplayer.Overall, the game probably deserves higher than 3 stars, but there are too many places where it can get confusing and you dont know what to do."
4,Pirates of the Caribbean,"My eight-year old got this as a Christmas present. It's a little challenging, but that's what he likes. You have to use the stylus when fighting some of the opponents, which is new to me. Takes a little more coordination. I would recommend this product."
5,Great!!,My grandson really likes it. can't stop playing with it. he'sreally hooked on it. ever since he went to dineyland he's being addicted to pirates!!
3,"Bought for my 9 year old son, played 1 day","My son loved this game at first, for about 4 hours, then a time or two of playing to make it seem like he was interested in it for my sake, then nothing. He never had any interest to play it beyond a day or so. Not sure if he got to a point he couldn't pass or what, but I was expecting the interest factor to last much longer than a day. \"
5,By far the best book i've seen dealing with employee rights,This book takes you through the whole process of the interview right through making the decision as to whether your rights have been violated and what to do if they have been. This is a very easy to read book done in a very thoughtful way exploring whether contesting an employers action is a smart decision to suing the hell out of them for a blatent violation of the law. Ill never go unprepared again.
3,"Great fit, lousy durability",Used these for years for bicycling. Fit great. Use a prescription insert. My problem is that they only last a season or two. Then the grip on the bows come off. The nose piece separates from the frame.
3,Expensive Replacement Parts,These glasses work well for sporting activities; however the replacement rubber ear holders and nose guards are more expensive than they should be. Also the nose guard replacements need to be glued and the manufacturer neglects this instruction. Plastic viewing replacements are tricky to install but after a few tries it becomes easier to perform
5,i love her,i love my little brietta and i am 10 and i got her for my 10th birthday and i love hernajy
1,Copy Cats,these kids are copy cats. there just coping the 2 time platinum music group SClub8. First american juniors steal s club 8's first single and make it there's now there copying songs from other people.Can't they rigth there own songs??????? tHese people are trying so much to copy other groups who are way better.
1,BAD CD,"HONESTLY, kids should not be singing on cd's because they can't!! They will never become famous and the boys' voices haven't even cracked, talk about bad singing!! well, i was absolutely disappointed with this cd!!!"
3,good,i loved the show american juniors and i like the single. however i have trouble understanding the lyrics. i wish they had printed and insert saying who sang what part.
3,Come On Kids!!,"Hey, is that the best you got? Album is an ok, bubblegum flavored kids CD. Will drive parents up the wall when kids play ""One Step Closer"" about a thousand times!"
1,They are not that great,"Yes indeed as some Sclub8's fan here has said, One Step Closer was originally a Sclub8 song. When American Juniors sang them, they sounded horrible compare to Sclub8. Also, the song Sundown, it was their new single to be released in London, yet America already sang their song!I must say, American Juniors kids are talented, but not talented enough than Sclub8."
1,UnOriginal,"Out of all the vocals, only Lucy's voice was nice. The starting was terrible. Who's singing it?? Sounds like a baby's voice! Totally unoriginal! Stole almost all songs from S Club and S Club 8! None of them, except Lucy, are talented...American Juniors are a total rip-off...American Idol is so damn better..I dun think the group will get any further at all!!.. May they have a windfall! I'd recommend you guys to buy singles/albums from S Club 8 instead of this crap..."
1,STUPIT HORRIBLE KIDS!,"American Junoiors was so stupit! The cd was horrible, they couldn`t sing for there lives, and Taylor, and Tori look like fat cipmunks!"
3,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","Not much money, will last one season maybe two. Great buy for the money so I rate it 3 stars."
4,Great Collection; diverse and easy to read.,"I bought this book as a gift for someone who loves reading and wanted something timely for the season. I ended up reading the whole thing before wrapping it. The stories were very diverse in plots, settings and characters but were all held together with the holiday theme. Many memories of my own came flooding back, especially the opening story that takes place less than 10 miles from where I grew up in a suburb of the east side of Cleveland. Each story is a fast read allowing me to visit many locales with many different characters. I recommend this for anyone wanting to get even more into the holiday season and as a window into the many stories that grow out of this powerful time of year."
2,Interpersonal Skills for Leadership,"This book is in fair shape, with a fair price. It took a little while like 2 weeks to receive it and don't think its really worth more than what the seller asked for it, but I am satisfied to be able to save a bundle this way! Thank You Nebraska bookstore!!!"
4,A detailed examination of central Christology,"Weinandy's ""Does God Change?"" addresses the Christological question of mutability in the divine nature, as is conceptually challenged in the notion of the Word 'becoming' man. Through a comparison with early and later Fathers of both East and West (though predominantly the latter), as well as with several modern thinkers, Weinandy examines in great detail the manner in which the 'becoming' of the Incarnation need not -and in fact does not- require 'change' in the divine nature of God; and in the process, the book definitively refutes several of the most common modern-day Christological errors on this front. Exceptionally dense in places, this book requires some level of academic familiarity with the field in order to be read effectively; but for those in the field, it is an extremely helpful text."
4,Hopeful,I wish I could get this album so I could here more of it. I heard it for the first time on web radio and thought they were great. If you like the Stripes you'll like these guys.
2,You got Warhammer in my LOTR!,"Or, rather, ""You got Warhammer fanwank in my LOTR!""I liked the concept, but the execution seems lackluster. The characters don't seem to have acutal personalities; the main characters, who are supposed to be going through some radical changes in their mindsets, seem to be following scripting directions instead of actually coming to their own decisions during the course of the story.For some reason, the three seperate ""books"" in Grunts all seem to be paced like they were meant to be published seperately. Note how the characters are all being introduced to the reader at the start of each of the three sections, as if the reader hadn't been paying attention for a few months between turning the pages.The rather lurid sex scene was, I thought, out of place for what came across as an otherwise fairly light-hearted fantasy comedy.Summary: Interesting theme, dull story."
3,Fun and light,"reading. A much needed different perspective in this genre. Cute kink among the female orcs. I don't want to meet them! I don't think this Ms. Gentle meant this book to be taken so seriously, but for her, maybe, a writing excercise that just happened to get published."
3,"Grunts!: a slightly offensive, violent, Middle Earth fantasy","The orcs of the horde of darkness are a pitifull, disgusting, disturbing bunch. where there's a complete mystery about just about everything in this race, one thing's for certain: they're all going to die. Or are they? This book tells what REALLY happened during a time when man still had to share the world with the other races. Not the best book for children to read, as it has plenty of adult content, and profanity. Perfect if you like guns and war. This book is by Mary Gentle."
2,Bored Now,"I borrowed this from my cousin, along with the warning that he'd only made it half way through the book. I didn't believe him when he said that I wouldn't be able to finish it, but I too only managed to get halfway through before I stopped and realized that I was incredibly bored. I found myself wondering exactly what the point of the book was, and exactly when it was going to be made. Generally, I always try to finish what I am reading, even if I don't like it. There are only a few that I've had to give up on. This happens to be one of them."
1,Thank goodness I only borrowed it.,"From the cheesy, comic book cover, to the disgusting descriptions of murders and bad habits, this book must rate as one of the worst I've picked up in years. Granted, I'm basing this on only the first 100 pages, after which I promptly and thankfully returned it to it's owner."
1,Grunts,"This has to be the worst book I have tried to read. Murderous, foul-mouthed, disgusting and cannibalistic characters did not make this enjoyable in the least. I found nothing humorous in this book. Stay away! If I could I would rate this -10."
2,Well...,"Let me just say that I am a sophomore student whose reading average is higher than a lot of people who attend my school. But let me tell you this... I could not understand one *damn* thing that was going on the entire time I was reading this... its like the characters magiclly shift from one posistion to another, events happen very quickly (about 3 pages max), and I wouldn't exackly call it a ""Fantasy With Attitude""... more like a ""Fantasy With Crap"". My first fantasy novel, and a bad one at that. I just hope I don't shift the book at different angles to read it when I pick up a ""Dragonlance"" book."
4,"Good Versus Evil, From the Evil's perspective","Having spent years of reading fantasy novels, where theGood guys are angelic and the bad guys are nasty S.O.B's,this story turns it all around.Are you tired of the Good guys in shining armor alwayshaving the cool magic items, the flashy Gods, the undefeatedstreak no matter what the odds?Imagine being an Orc in the battle field fighting thelikes of Gandalf or Theoden. Is this really fair?Do you have a chance? No, not until Mary Gentle putsa machine gun in your hands. Yes folks, its an AK-47 day.And that is just the beginning..."
4,"""Grunts"" is a terrific read... I couldn't put it down!","A high degree of detail & description. Very funny and at the same time brutally invigorating! A great cast of characters with plenty of storyline to go around. Mary Gentle's ""Grunts"" is like combining L. Ron Hubbard & David Drake together for an adventure you won't forget!"
3,"Not high art, but lots of fun","The first thing about this book that makes me laugh is that the author uses the name Mary Gentle. No, not immediately funny, but it will be once you start reading.The premise is that orcs have been cursed by a dragon after looting its horde. But the horde was a United States Marine Corps armory and the curse is to be Marines. Its actually a sort of blessing for them giving them an edge in the battle against the Light, but its hard for humans, let alone a gang of Orcs, to be Marines.The story is clever but the punchline does wear thin. Some of the gags are profoundly disturbing but for the most part, its a fun read and a memorably change of pace."
5,Hysterically funny satire of most fantasy tales,"This is one of those rare books that I've read so often I have to replace my copy. It's written from the perspective of the side of evil, so it's down and dirty, gritty and graphic in it's send up of ""E-ville"". It is a wonderful satire of all the sweetness-and-light-saccharine-good-always-wins tales where the elves, halflings, unicorns, etc. all join hands and sing ""Kumbaya""when they win. If you have half a brain in your head and aren't a bleeding heart liberal READ THIS BOOK and laugh your head off."
3,Interesting! But...,"What is interesting about this book is that it is good and bad in one! By this I meen that this book is superbly well written, described and fulfilling; full of action and realism and at times extreemly intense! But that's just the point.... Some other parts of it are offensive and disgusting to the point of violent nausea (I am using an understatement here)written with the same care for detail that seems to characterise her work. After all... orc does as orc is, and we can't expect orcs not to do or be as they are but I guess we could have been spared some of the worse detials ""Pass me another elf sargent"" as one of them. Perhaps I could consider reading more of her woork in the future."
5,"This is not trying to be Tolkien, and that is Good News!","I had given up on ""epic fantasy,"" it was all just knock-offs on Tolkien. But, looked at from the view-point of the ""bad"" guys, it is fresh and new. Take modern weapons, add in a curse, and extrapolate what happens to a fantastical society. In addition to being coarsely funny, the characters remain true to themselves and the milieu. Buy this book, just remember, the Orcs are the headliners, and they ARE Orcs after all."
4,"They're ugly, they're evil, but you'll love 'em.","A classic piece of humorous fantasy. We all know that Orcs are the bad guys, put upon and beaten by the 'good' races. But what would happen if the Orcs discovered serious weaponry and modern tactics?The comparison between Orcs and the kind of marines one sees in the movies is done beautifully.WARNING - Don't buy this book if you are easily offended. Do buy it if you like to laugh."
1,Complete Garbage,"One star, only because there's nothing lowerNot necessarily the worst book I've ever read, but a close second. The book attempts to be humorous, and misses the mark. Along the way it misses numerous opportunities for some pretty good gags. The little humor that is to be found is completely marred by graphic, disgusting, gratuitous and explicitly pornographic violence. The author should be nominated for the Saddam Hussein award for subtlety. Unnecessary examples include a pair of thieves who have a lot of potential for fun in the book, but early on rob a house and and in excruciating detail literally paint the walls with the victim family. The consistent protagonist would be a good comic antihero, but again, the image is sickly distorted by graphic descriptions of murder by rape and necrophilia. If this is supposed to be entertaining, then I sincerely hope the author is seeking therapy."
3,A satire,"If you like fantasy you will enjoy Grunts' irreverent look at the genre. If you love fantasy however you will hate this book for making fun of the genre. There is not much to the plot. The characters are humerous and it makes fun of desk jockey marines. Pick it up for a laugh, don't expect a story."
5,Christmas with Rosemary Clooney,"Wonderful CD by an honored singer. Have tried for years to find ""Here Comes Suzie Snowflake""and it's on here! So glad that I purchased this item."
2,Falls Down Easily,"Great size and everything, it's just that this tent will collapse if you touch the edges. And knowing kids, it collapses a lot."
2,Too Collapsable,"My sister gave this to my 2 year old twins for their birthday. I thought it would be great because it folded away easily to conserve on space; the problem is that it folds TOO easily. Once they enter the hut it collapses on top of them if they touch the sides. It doesn't have a bottom so the slightest little bump will cause it to fold up...which isn't really dangerous because it's so lite-weight, but I spend most of my time re-expanding it when they do play with it...I think that it would have been better to get a ball pit and just leave the balls out (or in if you want to clean up dozens of balls everyday)...that way there is a bottom to support the tent. I was very disappointed."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"THE TENT IS TOO FLIMSY. IT CAN'T SUPPORT ITSELF, IT'S AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER & IT GETS PUSHED ALL AOVER THE PLACE BY MY KIDS. THEY DON'T EVEN PLAY IN IT ANYMORE 'CAUSE THEY ARE OVER IT."
2,spiderman tent,"My nephew received this Spiderman tent for his birthday. He was so excited that he had to open it right away. He is only 3 years old, granted he is a little big than most 3 year olds and he had a very hard time getting into this tent. Once inside the tent, there was not much room for any of his friends at this birthday party to join him inside his new tent. Compared to other tents out on the market, I was very disappointed. Keep on shopping!!!!!"
3,Spiderman tent by playhut,"My son loved this tent. He fit perfectly in it and it fits inside his crib so he can sleep in his tent. My only beef with it is that somehow he's bent the frame of it so now it doesn't sit right on the floor. Actually it doesn't sit on the floor at all because of where it's bent. The tent would be better made if there were a floor to it and some support (similar to what keeps the top portion rigid) at the base of it to keep the ""legs"" (there aren't any but that's the best way to describe them) apart. The tent would also be better constructed if it didn't have one continuous wire for the frame on each side. If the wire gets bent there's no getting it back into its original shape, unless you take out the stitching (around the WHOLE tent frame) and repair it then restitch it, but who has that kind of time? Overall it's a fun toy for a little one but not a well thought out build. I'm glad we got it as a gift and it wasn't something we spent our money on."
1,JUNK,This is a piece of junk. My husband and I went to set it up to surprise our son and had it back in the box before he ever saw it. It is not worth the money!
4,"If your girl likes make believe, this is great.",My girl has all the baby bjorn stuff.. it's one of the rare toys that lasted more than a year without being thrown out from boredom or being broken.. a good buy if you have the baby bjorn doll and also if you are willing to buy something every now and then to complete the set..
2,Made me feel like a fool,"This movie left me feeling like I was tricked. I thought it would be about dragons in history and their relation to dinosaurs. The first 20 mins. was but after that it pretty much turned into ""evolutionists are all wrong and they deny creationism because they are scared of going to hell.""...seriously?It starts by interviewing scientists who have many interesting things to say and towards the end it pretty much only talks to preachers who scoff at modern science and lets us know how great Jesus is. There were some very well done parts. I just wish the movie could have actually been about dragons. =/I guess I do recommend buying this if you are in charge of like a youth group or an older childrens bible day care sort of program. This will probably get their heads out of all that ""evolution mumbojumbo"" :)"
1,"5-star parody, 1-Star documentary","I couldn't help feel embarrassed for Christians while watching this funny little fable. Basically, imagine somebody taking ancient creation myths and discussing them as if they're actually true.I have to go with Poe's Law regarding this film. That's the only way I can accept that this ever was produced. People can't be that ignorant.Perhaps we really do have a long way to go. At least we're not burning witches any more..."
4,Star Wars: The Last Command,It is basically a short review of the great book written by Zahn. I recommend the novel and this as a refresher for later times.
5,What Costumes!,"DeMille gives a very unique touch to this intriguing account of the love triangle between cleopartra, marc antony, and julius caesar. Claudette Colbert was excellent as Cleopatra, Henry Wilcoxen has this acting style that you never forget, and the cinematography is excelent. 1963's Cleopatra stands no chance against this excellent film."
3,Only Fair,"This movie wasn't what I expected. I thought it would be in color, or at least have the black and white a little sharper and give the scenes more definition. I was disappointed."
4,Excellent Film But Surprising Uneven Print,I have been looking forward to this film on dvd for some time. unfortunatelythe print isn't especially in mint condition. i recently bought the Pre-CodeHollywood set also from Universal Home Video and films in this set lookedmuch better. this is particulary surprising since the films in the boxedset are older than CLEOPATRA. With all the digital technology availabletoday the 75th Anniversary Edition of Demille's 1934 Oscar winning filmcould have looked a hell of a lot better.
4,Lover of Older Film,"I really like the older film's like this one. My only regret is it's in black and white, so you miss the color's of the set's and costume's. I have to give it four stars only for the lack of color."
1,Not a good start.,"I feel the need to vent my spleen at speedball. They make the worst nibs I've ever used. They'll rust on you, even if you take good care of them, and once that happens say goodbye to the quality of your line work. They're not the best I've ever used even when they are new. Don't buy them, it's false economy. I wish I knew the brand I was using back in the day, but I tended to just buy whatever loose nibs were available. My advice is, make sure your nibs are made of steel and that it's decent quality. Also, don't buy speedball. Ever. They don't know what they're doing and your nibs will go to pot almost immediately."
2,Bowls,"The Bowls are pretty, but I don't think its MICROWAVE SAFE. The edge of the bowls are made of steel. However has nice lids. Would not recommend if you are looking for multipurpose bowls."
5,Read this before you send money to a TV evangelist!,"Jason Blake is a great collage of all the TV evangelists rolled into one! He leaves a trail of bodies in his quest for fame, fortune and the US Presidency. The real victims were his children who were torn apart by murder, greed and lust. I followed Detective Tony Pinella step-by-step, right up to the last revealing moment of the book. What a surprise ending!"
4,"poster was wrinkled/creased, but great customer service","I bought this as a gift for a Dali fan. It came in a good, undamaged box, but when I took the poster out of the box, it had a crease/wrinkles through it, as if the poster got bent while rolled up. The quality of paper that it was printed on is nice. It's a little thick. It's not like that stuff that you see teenagers tacking up on their walls. And the quality of the printing itself was nice. It was not blurry or pixelated, like I've seen on a lot of affordable prints. I also bought it with an easy hang frame (which I never had before, & I didn't even know what an easy hang frame was), and...well, they aren't the best quality frames. I felt the poster would not be secure in that kind of frame. So I purchased a normal frame at a local store, and called it good. When I told the seller of the damage, they offered to send a new poster free of charge."
3,"Huge white border, looks a little less cool than I thought","The white border is gigantic, this may not be immidiately obvious. the top/bottom are a good 3 inches of white border and both sides are about 4 inches. I'm not a huge Dali fan, but his stuff is cool, I will say I'm a college student, but in my opinion the picture itself didn't look as fascinating as I expected, so unless you're a huge dali fan, maybe pick something else."
4,Insight into the real Lincoln,"If you like reading about Lincoln this may be your read. Be warned, much of what is here is political dissertation of the time and as such is very dry. On the other hand his wartime telegrams give insight into a man who wanted to be very much involved in the actions of his troops. I espeically enjoyed his dispatchs to General McClellan. His letters and speechs make clear his real feeling on blacks, slavery and the Emancipation Proclamation. All evidence of the real Lincoln."
3,FLASH PROBLEMS,"I have had this camera for a little over a year and a half and have loved it until recently. All of a sudden, for no reason, the flash stopped working. The only way I can take a picture is to turn off the flash and then due to the slow shutter speed the picture is very blurry. There is no visible damage to the flash. When I talked with Olympus I could not get a price to fix the flash but they said it needed to be sent in for repairs which could take several weeks!!! We had another Olympus camera before this which broke as well. I am very disappointed. If you don't mind getting a new camera ever couple of years this is a great camera for you."
1,too fragile,"I would NOT recommend buying this camera. It's nice enough, but it's WAY too fragile. I dropped mine the first day I had it (not hard, and not so that it left a mark), and the lens cover no longer opened. This because te lens cover slides into the body of the camera, and the tolerance is so small that any little ding can prevent the cover from sliding cleanly. I was able to ""fix"" it by gently squeezing the body of the camera (again, with no detectable bending of anything, emphasizing the very small tolerance of the fittings), but that didn't last. I'm going to look for something sturdier."
1,Lasted < 4 months,"Stay away from this camera. It lasted < 4 months and Olympus did not honor their ""warranty"". What a waste of money!"
4,Mary,"I really like the tune, ""Mary"" and I noticed that the artist has a very cool video on youtube. The song just carries you away and the instrumentation and vocals are very, very good. Nice and easy going music. Good deal."
3,Another average SVU book- average on the better side,I enjoyed reading about Lila and Bruce's survival in the mountains... Jessica's sorority scandal kept me turning the pages also. But what a witch that Alison Quinn is!
2,Not quite good enough,These burner covers were made of thin metal. They bent or buckled very easily. They need to be made of heavier metal.
5,FABULOUS,"two words:very fabulous !but should we expect anything else from a modern day cleopatra, who transcends all boundaries, and brings it back to the lovely nile with such grace and true real beauty inside and out.if you can handle real beauty that is not manufactured by falseness........ if you can breathe it, then take this book, fore oxygen lives within this book for all to take."
2,Mixed bag,"hmmm...just received this yesterday and read through it. Beautifully presented book with unusual editorial and stylising quirks in its presentation. If you are looking for a book that will give you meaty information on Iman and her outlook on life, this is not the one. There is some detail about her early life, but then it explodes into pictures and interviews and different short pieces on the essence of being black and fashion etc. To be honest, most of the subject matter is merely flirted with rather than explored.The pictures and photographs are amazing and it is a great pictorical legacy for the supermodel that is Iman.It is a book you will read cover to cover in 2 hours - and something you can go back to, and flick through it again.But I'm sorry to say I didn't think there was much substance"
4,I must have read a differnet book !!!,While I found the pictures to be wonderful. I found the text to be so much more. Being a person of color I could relate to much of what is written here. Yes the West's perception of skin color needs to be addressed. People of all ages need to read this book for this matter alone. It is not preachy or self involved as some have said. It discusses more than fashion and addresses all of us. Beauty is the tip of the iceberg here and one must read the book and look a little deeper. Not just at Iman but ourselves and each other as well.
3,Fun toy but it deflates,"I bought this toy for my five year old son for Christmas since he was in karate. He uses the toy daily to practice his punches and kicks and I notice it deflated some. I wish it was tough like the regular punching bags in the gym, but because it has to be inflated, and is for my five year old, it's great."
4,Very insightful,"This is a great read for anyone who wants to know what God says about marriage and singleness. I used this book in research for a sermon on this topic at our church and the response from our young adults was very positive. The author is clear, concise and faithful to the texts of Scripture he references in the book. Definitely worth adding to your personal library."
1,Couldn't even read it all...,"Okay I'll admit, I couldn't even read most of this book. From the onset I found the ignorant dismissal of valid issues which burden Christian singles to be upsetting.As someone who loves God and has tried to put him first in a life of singleness, I was looking for some wisdom that would actually be applicable to ""where I live""... instead I got ""be warmed and filled""..."
3,fave,this shampoo is not as good as the ones by the same manufactor in the pink bottle but it will do - not worth the price compared to the pink bottles
1,Super OLD Product!!!,I have used Enjoy products many times before....they're the best. I was excited to find it at such a reasonable price. But this conditioner is obviously super old. It has that tell-tale old smell to it. Not worth the hassle to return. I will never purchase from this seller again.
2,Using Autocad : An Introduction to Computer-Assisted Design,"I was excited to see an AutoCAD book specificaly for theatre. The excitement was short lived. Unfortunately I found the book out of date. I am using AutoCAD 2000i. This book is a reference for R12-14. The command buttons and dialog windows are different from R2000i. The tutorials used are similar to other CAD books. The emphasis is on learning specific commands. There is no reference to theatre drafting until the later chapters. It would be great if the book had screen shots of the drafting exercises, so you can reference to what you are drawing. A rethink of the exercise headings is needed, from Excerise 1- Printing a file to EX #1- Drawing a flat. Students need to relate the use of CAD to theatre drafting early on. The book comes with a useful CD-Rom of sample files and an instrument library. Overall, I Think Mr. Decuir has good start for a book. I hope the both of us can keep up with changes that Autodesk will introduce in the future."
2,Not enough variation,"Although the video was easy to follow, there was no variation between the segments. The 10 minute segments were basically the same. I was looking for a quick video that I can do in the morning but it seemed that I spent most of the time warming up and stretching and then continuing with the same moves. If you are at all experienced and are looking for a quick targeted workout this is not the video for you."
1,Not as good as the old VHS Tape,I was disappointed. I lost my old tape which had the same title and it had cardio intervals (with step) so it was an entire workout - not just very short disjointed segments of arms.
2,Not what I Remember,I ordered this DVD expecting it to be like the original Abs of Steal VHS tape from the early 90's. It is not the same. It has baically the same 15 minute excercises for the abs three times in a row. I really would not recommend this DVD for toning the Abs.
3,it's ok,"i like tamilee's way of working out. I had the ""body of Steel"" on vhs and i was looking for the same, the dvd version and instead i got this. she pulls out equipment like the sliding piece and that just destroyed the whole experience for me. my space is limited and i don't have wooden floor where i can slide back and forth. i'm disappointed because i was really looking for the same routines that are on the vhs, i think it's a better workout.i still think she's great and her approach is the best, but i wish i had the vhs body of steel dvd version as it was."
4,Decent workout - esp. when short on time,"I really enjoy the abs & arms part of this DVD. As someone else said, if you're looking for a major ab workout, this isn't for you. She focuses more on the arms than the abs. The ab workouts are good, there just aren't as much as I expected when I bought this. I also like her fitness tips she gives when she's working out. It's nice to hear how knowledgable she is. I like to use these workouts as a warm-up to my cardio. However, I'm not crazy about her leg workouts. I don't care for the sliding exercises she does and I just don't feel like they work for me. I find they are too easy and I get bored doing them. It may be better for a beginner. The arm and segments definitely make this worth buying though."
1,Waist of money,"I am a dance aerobics teacher and I buy alot of fitness dvds for inspiration and new ideas. I bought this because the reviews seemed good. I really dislike it. I found Tamilee irritaing and the workouts easy and old. I would not recommend buying this dvd.I loved the dvd perfect abs, very good. Janis Saffell dvds are great and she has a amazing body, Leisa Hart dvds are great and the ripped series is much better than this."
3,Sue's review,"This product is ok, but I thought the arms would be a new addition not combined with the abbs. I feel like I'm not getting the abb work out I want from this video. I wouldn't have bought it if I knoew this."
2,For Girlie men,I was a bit disappointed in this tape. The workouts are too easy. I had masteredAbs of Steel I and was looking for Abs of Steel 2. I couldn't find it so I bought this one but its too easy. I found a used Abs of Steel 2 and I like it much better.
1,incubus rocks!,"well incubus is the best band I ever heard in my life,it has so many different rymes,funk mixed with rock,metal etc... No band can be like incubus is... My favorite albums are the old ones like fongus amongus,science,when incubus attacks...etc... amazing songs like new skin,shaft,trouble in 421,the answer...!!!damn ill never finish...i will like to meet incubus fans...[...]"
3,Too little of Catherine,"I purchased this CD to listen to one of the most beautiful and talented ladies on television (Lindsay Rappaport, ""One Life To Live"")sing some good tunes. It is VERY unfortunate that she is MIA on her own album. She is over-powered by two male friends of hers and doesn't even sing AT ALL on a couple of tracks. When she does get a chance to sing, she is exceptional as I hoped she would be, but her performances are too few and far between to be worth spending $15.00 on."
3,No Dave In This???,"I popped buy looking for music by Catherine Hickland becauseI just got done watching good ol' knight rider..Dave andCatherine ineed sang in two eps.. ""white bird"", ""let it be me""Actually I really liked that song, ""White Bird"" sung byDave and Catherine.. why isnt it on this CD---I dont think Pam and Dave ever did any duets on any of Dave's CD--s -- although that's a guess -- I dont have any Dave CD's -I might start a collectionn.."
1,Full of errors,"This book might not seem so overpriced if it had been written and edited well. But be forewarned: it's not. It's full of egregious errors of fact and scholarly convention, not to mention unbelievable typos (check out the *kanji* in the glossary for starters). Before deciding to purchase this book for a library, one should consult reviews in professional journals like *Journal of Japanese Studies*, *Japanese Religons* (from NCC Center), and *Journal of Asian Studies*."
1,Nothing Like The Best,"This is Ernie K-Doe, but it is not his original hits. He is singing them again and they just don't sound the same. It is amazing that some artists don't understand that fans loved their original hits."
1,Switch,"The trimmer itself is fine, but it has the worst engineered dual safety switch I have ever encountered. The awitch in the upper handle is so bad that I sent the trimmer back thinking that it was faulty."
4,Well,"The earrings themselves were exactly what I was looking for in terms of size. The studs are rather small and look cute. One problem I do have with them is that the post isn't dead center in the back and instead is sort of off in a corner on the back of the setting. Not a huge problem, but was a bit disappointed as I wanted earrings that were centered. They look great on your ears, but still just like for things to be centered. Great buy for the price though. The crystal looks brilliant and the white gold has a very nice clean color to it."
2,weak!weak!weak storyline,how can anyone say this was a great read? You all know the storyline so won't go into that again but with the exception ofthe sex I found this book geared toward an adolescent. In thebook it states it's Dec 24th 7pm - almost two weeks of story and 50 pages go by then the next day it's Christmas morning. This happened several times and I could get past that - but the characters were just too unbelievable and naive. This could have been a good story but too many things just didn't add up.
1,Horrible product that is difficult to assemble,Do not waste your time with this product. The assemble is difficult since the washer was the wrong size and treading a screw through a sleeve that took nearly one hour for two screws. The motor is noisy and the lights are far too bright. I sent it back. You will probably so the same.
5,BEAUTIFUL AND RELAXING,THIS IS A 2CD SET FROM MARANTHA MUSIC. THE VOCALS AND INSTRUMENTALS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND RELAXING ESPECIALLY FOR A QUIET TIME OR BACKGROUND MUSIC.
3,One Track Wonder - Beware buying Whole Album,"Please carefully preview every track before you buy anything besides track 5 - Intothinair . The Bourne Supremacy ""club scene"" music set me on a quest to find this track, and then curiosity led me to find the album. I am fortunate to have a library card and access to Freegal which saved me from wasting $ buying this album without being more careful first.This Album is proof that one good track does NOT a good album make. The only other track I could stand listening to is 10 - Waiting for Verdeaux because it has sort of an 8-bit thing going for it.Please don't pull the trigger prematurely until you preview the tracks. If you like them, as some reviewers here obviously do, please support this artist. I simply want to share my warning with everyone because track 5 is so out of place in this album that it is almost unbelievable.Thanks!"
2,Very tight fit,"This was my first online shoe order. I figured it would be pretty safe since it was a slip-on. I'm usually in a size 11 or 12, so I ordered a 12. While my feet are pretty wide, I've never had to purchase wide shoes.These shoes were incredibly tight. They were long by about an inch, but the width was unbearably constricted. They reminded me of squeezing on a pair of tight rock-climbing boots -- I really had to squish to get my feet in.The result was so uncomfortable, these are going back. I wouldn't have expected this from 'slip-on' shoes. It gets a two instead of a one since the quality appears great."
3,Me duraron muy poco tiempo ...,"He tenido una buena experiencia con esta marca de zapatos desde hace muchos años pero compré un par de zapatos de estos exclusivamente este modelo y al cabo de 2 meses se me rompió la suela por donde esta la amortiguación del aire abajo del talón, primero sonaban como si silvaran cada vez que pisaba y despues se termino de romper la suela por debajo del talón, además que los compré en 70 $ y el día siguiente estaban en 40 $, realmente tuve mala suerte, en este momento estoy buscando otros, les seguiré siendo fiel a la marca, les daré otra oportunidad."
5,Excelente par de Zapatos,"Sin duda alguna un excelente par de zapatos clarks, muy confortables, excelentes para caminar son adictivos con una amortiguacion excelente, en mi caso soy viajero frecuente y es el mejor par de zapatos para caminar en un aeropuerto que he tenido, la talla es exacta la que tu pidas en mi caso pedi 12 y me quedaron perfectos, los recomiendo ampliamente!!!!A pesar de que son excelentes me ha pasado lo mismo que a Marcos el zapato se ha dañado en la misma parte con solo 2 meses de uso inaceptable deja mucho que desear sobre todo cuando hablamos de clarks como marca........"
2,leaker,this tea pot is perfect in its looks but it leaks from the spout and spits water all over.... So I would say its decorative not functional.
3,Looks good from a distance,"I bought this to finish off my tea kettle collection that sits on top of the fireplace mantel. From a distance it looks superb, however up close it is a bit flimsier than I expected. Copper body is very thin, the spout is puny and the handle held in the best traditions of Chinese manufacturing. However, I have no intention of actually using it for anything other than a decoration, so it suits my needs just fine. Considering that picked it up as an Amazon Warehouse deal for less than $16 shipped, I can't complain!"
4,One of the Five tapes defective,"I have one request to Amazon.com. When we as a customer order something from Amazon.com and it is from another company, if there is a problem what is the right method to solve the problem? Do we send an email to Amazon.com or try to contact the seller directly. Please clarify this on your website for myself and all customers.Of the five tapes I received in this order, one of the tapes (#420 Side B) is defective. The speaker's voice is going very fast and is very much distorted. I need a replacement for this tape since I have not been able to listen to it yet, though I have completed all the other tapes.Please email me immediately if you are going to take care of this matter. Waiting for your response. This is part of a course I am taking so my receiving the replacement cannot be delayed.Thank you,Dawn Lash"
2,All My Darling Daughters,"The movie came in a timely manner but when I played it, the picture was shaky through most of it."
4,great book but...,"it has less correlation to traditional runes that i would have liked. For instance, the traditional futhark order isn't observed, nor are the traditional names of the runes given. However, the pictures and stories are wonderful, and the book lends a new and creative perspective to runework which is at once easy to understand and very cryptic."
2,Give credit where it is due,"I want to love this book, it has a lot of great stories and incredible pictures. This came in the same day i received a book from R.I. Page, and the two can not be more different. Yet both have their place in the Runic studies, and im not one to completely dismiss all perspectives that are not conservative or completely historical.Yet one thing gives this such a low review, and for soon to be obvious reasons this is highly offensive. The story of the Rune Sowillo, is a complete rip off of the Celtic story of the God Lugh!! They did not even try to change it, it is almost verbatim taken from Celtic mythology, and they in no part of the book admit to this. This should be a criminal offense, and i hope they are reading this and recognize that they need to give credit where it is due. I wonder how many of the other stories were completely ripped off from other myths!:lugh:"
2,toner is outrageous,"While the speed is okay and the print quality is excellent, anyone considering this printer be aware that the toner cartridges at $200USD/color last about half as long as they should. This printer may seem like a deal up front but it's outrageous to keep running. I'm up to almost 1200 dollars in toner during the six months I've owned this thing. Not good."
4,Unlike his others,"This is a short note in Michener's style of novels, it ties a family into their past back to the Constitution, but always just near to the main characters as we know our history. It also has the constitution at the end of the novelette and a preview of Alaska. All in all it could be said this was a writing for profit. I don't believe that to be fact. Looking deeply it tells a wonderful story of ""could have been"" based on true history. The constitution is very good reading for all in our country. I am sad to say that most of our young people have never read it. This would be a stellar book for a high school history class, sadly I don't beleive the interest would be there not only from students but the faculty themselves. there are always the exceptions to all in life so we hope the percentage that do read and understand what our forefathers did we may have to do also. The story depicts the honor we must all have for our country."
3,Michener's civics lesson on the Constitution.,"Written in the aftermath of the Oliver North hearings, this very short book digs into the U.S. Constitution as it applies in today's world. The entire U.S. Constitution, with amendments, is reprinted at the end of the book and makes very interesting reading in and of itself. Do YOU really know what the Constitution says?"
1,A bad try on Michener's behalf.,"This was one book that seemed interesting because I thought that the main character would get to point of The Trial, but it was just him thinking about his heritage for some odd reason. He never got into trouble or anything. This was a struggle for me, even though I read many books. In my personal opinion, this wasn't even a decent book. I strongly reccommend getting another book by this man, because he has other, greater works. The length of this book doesn't even count for a chapter in any of his longer books."
1,This book will not add to Michener's literary legacy,"This book was not one of his best attempts. It was barely even an attempt. I have read almost all of his novels and with the sole exception of ""Iberia"" I liked this the least. The volume is short without any of the place or character development for which Michener is known. This volume is a complete waste of time. I would read Covenant for the second time instead"
1,I HATE IT!!,"I am very sorry. I really didn't know what I was buying, I thought it was shredded, but it was near powder.. I bought 24 pk. and trashed 23 31/64 pks. Worse purchase of my life. I'm sure more people like this product., than don't. I do however like the real beef jerky from Jack Link's, so that's what I'll buy."
4,Differences in texture.,This is an excellent bulk purchase. I have found that the texture varies though between different purchases. I tend to prefer a more puffy texture of the product and usually get the puffy texture 1 out of 2 purchases. The other texture is a rougher texture. Overall I am very pleased.
3,Well...it's dried beef,"If you are trying to quit using tobacco this is probably not going to do it for you. It didn't work for me. It tastes fine but is way too dry. Also, naturally, there is no nicotine so you won't get any of the stuff you are hooked on in the first place. I don't know what else you'd use it for except as maybe a substitute for ""bacon bits"" on your salad or something as due to it's dryness it's tough to get out of the can."
2,Not Sure the Point-Bad Packaging,"CAREFUL!! My nine year old stepson is around people that dip REAL tobacco in similar packaging. Therefore, he idolizes this as a way to mock the older guys and their bad habit. When he came for a visit he wanted some so we bought it. Next thing we know, he was asking for a snack. When we inquired about the jerky, he said it was not to eat but to ""put in your mouth and suck the juice"". He even packed it like grown men do their tobacco chew. Granted, a child will absorb what he sees around him but I feel the packaging makes it look too much like a child's version of adult chew; reminds me of the candy cigarettes. So, this product in my opinion is either for a child as a stepping stone to chewing tobacco or an adult's step down from it...otherwise, what's the point?"
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!,"This ""toy"" was not what I expected. It was a kit and I wanted the actual car. My grand-child was very disappointed. I have been looking for a ferrari car already together but as I said very disappointed. Since my little one opened the box, I could not send it back, which means I lost money."
2,"Watch your sizes, not all fit the same",Watch the size and measure your clarinet. found out from music teacher not all clarinets are the same even if the ad says they are.
4,Good for support!,"This book allows one to understand that the challenges of temptation for those struggling with weight loss is normal.Some people kick themselves for backsliding on the diet trail. But this is verifivation that you still can continue and get over those mental humps.This is chrystals everyday challenges that gets her through the storm. She begins to see that there is light at the end of the tunnel.I admire her because she experimented and found a method that was good for her. She teaches that there is no ""blueprint"" available for everyone.If this book taught me anything it was the power of jeeping a journal. It will help you see where the problem lies and how to get through; and it will enable you to identify what is causing you to stifle your plans. It may be mental, physical or spiritual.I use this book strictly for motivation. It's nice to read the words of someone who has been there.I'd like to see her now! I hope she has kept up the good work."
4,"Good Book, A little unorganized",I would like to give this book 3 1/2 stars but there aren't any 1/2's so I have written it. I really enjoyed her story and how she worked thru her struggles. It was a little unorganized but still enjoyable.
